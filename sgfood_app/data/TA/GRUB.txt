Stumbled across this place on a Thursday evening when it was taking the last order. Had a grilled chicken salad. It was surprisingly good.
Will definitely be back to try the other dishes on the menu.
5
Great burgers and pasta. We especially liked the atmosphere and the relaxing environment in the park. Good service from the crew too.
3
The bacon carbonara was very tasty, with fragrant smokey bacon chunks and topped with egg yolk. However the har cheong gai burger was too strongly flavored with the prawn paste. Fries were average.
5
Back to Grub for a few times and the food quality has always been good. They have upgraded their ordering to self service on iPad system.
4
Had the breakfast plus mocha and fries, overall the food is average and would not make you want to remember to come back again, but environment and scenery is nice.
5
Had the bacon carbonara and the Thai pork salad. They went surprisingly well together! Will go back and get those again.
4
Food is good and yummy. Environment is good for gathering with friends or family. The staff is polite too!
4
Our family favourites are the burgers and the pasta. Great quality food at fairly reasonable pricing. Prior reservation recommended due to limited seating at the restaurant. We came during CNY and restaurant was serving a limited menu but still we were spoiled with choices. Service was friendly and prompt. The restaurant boasts of a view of the park which adds to the relaxing atmosphere. Grub is also family friendly

Not sure what happened to this place since the last time I dined here but things sure have changed....Buns disintegrated the minute I picked the burger up, patty's were dry and tough, pasta and service was mediocre.I remember this place bursting at the seams with people at one time. Reservations were necessary and the wait time was pretty lengthy. Those days are over unfortunately.I hope that they get their act back together as I did have quite a few enjoyable meals here once upon a tim
3
Food was only average. Nothing really to rave about. One of the waitstaff also quite clueless when asked questions regarding the menu. She had to consult with her colleagues for the longest time, only to return and tell us the wrong thing. The only thing that was good was the lime drink with honey. That was super refreshing. It's not bad per se, just nothing really stood out. Nice park though. So convenient if you want to see bishan park before or after
4
Good service and food . Baby friendly and willing to accommodate for special request like no seasoning . Will definitely come back again
3
The ambience was really nice, which we all liked, but the food didn't really deliver so that was really disappointing. The most disappointing one was their namesake burger, where the meat was so dry, we didn't even want to finish it.
5
It was my second visit, and it did not disappoint me. Great burgers and food. Most importantly, great service and the fantastic park dining experience
5
Been to Grub a few times and the experience is always pleasant. The cafe is situated in the bishan park. Nice place to chill and see some greenery.
4
Had the Grub Cheeseburger and a beer. Burger was definitely worth the buck, love the freshness of the patty.
1
Food was soooooooooo sooooooo. Steak was v tough and potatoes terrible. Calamari was v tough and smelt of feet

Came to this place with a friend for dinner, having heard quite a bit of good reviews from others. It was pretty quiet on a Sunday night, possibly due to the rain. We sat inside. Just a note: the indoor seating area is cozy, so keep your volume down. There's also entertainment for kids in the form of pictures for colouring, etc. I had the Mushroom Cheeseburger (came with fries), which is by default done medium, as per the menu. My friend had the Grilled Angus Steak, and she had hers done medium as well. Only have pics of my order, but not hers. Presentation-wise, the food looked good. Taste and texture-wise, it was quite different: both of us agreed that the meat we were served was too chewy/tough on the outside, and undercooked on the inside. The beef patty and steak both appeared to be done just a bit better than medium-rare. My friend's steak actually still had blood visible on her last bit of steak, and a little more reddish than the patty I had. With my burger, the mushroom cheese was kinda bland and tasteless, while my friend's steak sauce was reportedly very salty, and the taters somewhat undercooked. My fries and her green veggies were ok though. Seems they do sides somewhat better than mains. We didn't want to bring it up to the management, because it would be unsanitary to have the food re-done, or a waste if they decided to do another set for us. Service, however, was friendly, good and prompt. But I would caution that the food service was too quick and not well-checked through. We were served our orders very quickly after placing it, which leads me to question whether the meat was allowed to cook properly after being removed from the fridge. The meat also lacked the flavour that beef usually has when grilled properly. The standard of food really needs to be improved and currently not worth the price I'd pay, especially at an eatery supposedly of good standard
5
Any burger lover should give this place a shot! I love their prawn paste chicken burger. The bun is grilled to perfection and the prawn paste chicken patty is well marinated. Other than the food, the place is quiet and perfect for a night's out in the heartlands. Service is excellent too!
5
The ambience is casual, relaxing and very green. Waiters are helperful and attentive. Food is excellent in presentation and taste. Our children get to participate in their free flower arrangement workshop. They really enjoyed the whole experience. The French Fries with the special sauce is their favorite

I first knew about GRUB because of their Mentaiko Fries ($9.50++), but it took me 2 years to haul myself here. The Mentaiko Fries are great for sharing & I would order this again-- but make sure you eat them while it's hot because the fries are pretty meh when they get cold. The Maple Bacon Burger ($14.80++) surprised me so much; the maple butter & grilled pineapple flavours complimented the bacon patty (which wasn't overly salty - yay!). As a traditional bacon-disliker, I was curious about "thick-cut" pork bacon. I ended up liking it because it thick-cut = meatier, & I can easily deconstruct the burger, cut away the fats, & thereafter assemble the burger back on my spoon to eat it. And it was actually pretty juicy!Sakura Ebi Pasta ($18.80++) was absolutely prawn galore! Plenty of fried sakura ebi, juicy prawns & a supposed hint of mentaiko which... I honestly couldn't notice. but still yummy.I don't have a high tolerance for spicy food, but the Chilli Crab Pasta ($19.80++) had a great level of heat for me. The sauce wasn't overpowering, & had a great balance of spicy + slightly sweet. The soft-shell crab, unfortunately, was not crispy, but I can overlook the soggy crab because the sauce is da bomb.The coffee taste in the Rose Gold Latte ($5.50++ hot or $6.50++ iced) was very mild, & there was a slight sweetness that was pleasant but which honestly rather do without. I think for my next coffee here, I'll just get the regular latte; it's $0.50 cheaper, anyway.The Churros ($8.80++) were the most disappointing of the lot-- great crispy exterior, but an overly doughy inside. The Dark Chocolate & Yuzu White Chocolate sauces, while generous & interesting, weren't enough to save the strange texture of the churros.

Great food, attentive service! The food was good, and the place was packed. STaff were a little busy as susch but they were sufficiently attentive!
3
I love the location & surroundings. Food is good.
Most of service crew are friendly & helpful , just a female whom thinks her work is more important than guests spoils the perfect day.
5
Burger was juicy and tasty, pesto pasta was delicious , just the portion s bit small , coffee was strong and aromatic
2
i went for a pre-christmas brunch with my bestie. the brunch menu was very limited and there were insects on my table. lack of staff and new staff who were not adequately trained at the cashier.
5
Food was delicious, reasonably priced and great value for money. Do make reservations though even for weekday lunch especially if you want to sit indoors.
5
Yummy food and good environment. Not very crowded during weekday. Perfect place for gathering.love their mushroom pasta.
4
GRUB is situated inside bishan park and there wasn’t much people at night so its was rather peaceful and good for chit chatting. The food was okay but what we liked was the environment there.
4
Biggest bugbear is the location. Not very accessible unless you have a car. Relatively small place, although was quite full that Saturday. I would guess those that live nearby would be regulars. Price wise was just above average. Went for their christmas special which was alright. Food all came out really fast so alot was cold by the time we got to most of it. Table space was also insufficient so we had to eat faster. Probably wouldn't go back.
5
I love GRUB's burger! The beef patty was done nicely and the cheese oozing out as I cut into the burger.. Ohmy.. My friends had the pasta which was not too bad as well but I am a burger person :P Another friend ordered salmon and it was pretty good :
5
Our family of 4 loves to dine at Grub amidst the lush park setting. We live in the vicinity so itâ€™s great for all to take a stroll there before and after a meal. The menu is great and food creative and tasty with good healthy options.
3
Service was fast and place was nice but was not impressed by the food. Ordered pasta, ribeye steak and pizza. Pizza was disappointing!
5
It’s been a while since I had a good cheeseburger with cheese oozing out from the middle of the meat patty.
4
Food is nice and the service was prompt. There's also a car park nearby making it really convenient.
4
Nice ambience for gathering...in a park. The beef patty was too dry & stiff... it would be good if patty is mixed with onions panko & cheese... abit pricey though.
5
We have been to Grub many times now. Nice casual environment. Sakura ebi pasta still one of our favorites. And you can't go wrong with the burgers. They have added new items to the menu which is a welcomed variety.
5
Staff were very friendly. Asked for their help to give my girlfriend a birthday cake surprise and they cooperated fully. Very good service.
4
They were helpful in helping me arrange my reservation even though the Chope system didn't allow it.
Mentaiko fries and Truffle Pork Floss fries were not bad. The rest of the food was average. The cheeseburger was a bit dry, perhaps overcooked.
3
The main aren’t much to choose from and under Pastas mostly are prawn and just thinking those who are allergy to prawn can’t order pastas.
It will be good to hv more mains course like before they serve more choices.
4
Deluxe cheeseburger is thick and succulent. Chilli crab pasta would be better to have some actual crab meat other than just one deep fried soft shell crab. Most disappointed with salted egg yolk wings.
4
Nice environment, affordable and good food. Service was good as well. Went on a friday night for dinner but not very crowded.
4
I requested for an outdoor corner table in my reservation, and was allocated that upon arrival.
Food was decent, was served up fast and my friend and I had an enjoyable evening.
5
Food and service were great, atmosphere was completely relaxed and chill. Great place for a nice catch up with family/friends (place is kid friendly too) after a walk in the park. Only drawback was that it's a little bit inaccessible
5
Wonderful cafe setting for families. And they organise sensory play tables for the kids- bonus on top of being right in the middle of a gorgeous park.
Food was tasty. Service good. Prices reasonable. Will definitely be back.
3
Conveniently located with parking facilities nearby. Nice place to habg out with friends. Quality of good is ok. The brunch sets could be improved.
4
Ordered har chong gai burger & fish burger. Nice food. Huge portion. Nice relax view in the greeneries.
5
The mentaiko fries was yummy. In general, food portion is big and nice. A kids friendly restaurant. Be sure to make reservation as the place is not very big.
5
Good atmosphere good food good price nice love it service ok drinks nice everything is good love having lunch and dinner there
5
Great ambience, tasty food. At a reasonable price too, given the quality of food and huge portions. Fast service. Interesting and good variety for both food and drinks selection.
5
i came here often to have our meal. usually once a month or once every 2 months.i like their truffle pizza, truffle pork floss fries, har cheong gai burger, crispy fish burger. Their churros used to be nice. However, recent 2 visits, their churros standard seems to drop
3
first visit to grub at amk /bishan park. as we have a group of 10 persons. the staff whom served us had missed out 1 of the orders. he had repeated the orders to us, but probably we had failed to understand each other. so when 9 of our orders arrived and the last order took forever, so we asked to check if any orders was left out and was told 2 orders are coming up. so we waited, until 1 order was served and the last order still wasnt served. and we asked again, was told we have no outstanding orders. so it really puzzled us. there was so much confusions and we made the last order, but it was like 9 of us had already finished. despite that small episode, the deluxe cheeseburger is superb, pasta is so-so (pasta was quite 'hard') and pizza is acceptable. considering the superb chesseburger, i will probably consider going back again, but definitely not the branch in bishan. cheers
4
We has burgers, pastas and breakfast platter. Their pastas are my favourite and breakfast plate is satisfying. Har Jeong Kai Burger was dry but the portion is good. Worth a try.
4
Have been coming for a few weekend visits. Efficient service and friendly service. Like their burgers think it's one of the better ones in town.
4
the service was good, loved the har cheong gai burger! with mentaiko fries. however the ebi sakura pasta was abit dry. great ambience and dating experience
5
Had my brunch there on national day. The quality of the food has maintained over the years and prices did not go up alot considerably compared to many other cafes.
3
Went to visit Grub again as Snatch had a 1 for 1 deal for its Mentaiko Fries! Ordered the deal, Teriyaki Chicken Pizza and Churros! The food overall was average! Could have been better!
4
Ordered the Grub Breakfast Platter, it's delicious. Love the toast (wished there were more) and the cheese chicken sausage.
4
It's a good chill out place with friends, not too noisy, nice ambience. Good drinks selections as well. Food wise is good enough :)
5
I visited Grub on 23 July 2017, time of 5.30pm.
Service was smooth. Staff was friendly. Food was nice. There was a message that recommend me to purchase a $50 voucher at a promotion of 10%.
I will visit again.
5
It's my 2nd time at Grub but my first time having their pasta.. Carbonara & Chili Crab pastas were amazing! And don't miss out on their mentaiko fries - I have it every single time I dine there. Service was quick and ambience was on point on a cool Monday evening.
4
I find in Singapore you are either eating at a cheap hawker market, a mid-priced cafe/restaurant in a shopping mall, otherwise an expensive restaurant.Grub was a refreshing surprise. A beautiful setting in the Bishan-Ang Mo Kio park. Overlooking a lake and lots of greenery. The food - mainly western - was fine and reasonable for the location. It's worth a try
5
Great patty! Delicious buns, you can eat them on their own too. Probably the best burger at this price point.
Great plus: enjoy this while you are in the park, surrounded by trees.
4
Love the restaurant decor and surrounding. Very nice ambience, suitable for relax lunch getaway or weekend brunch. Food was decent too with some hit and misses.
3
Food was so so and a little pricey. Used to be able to being pets in but now that only allow for pets to be tied outside the edge of chairs. Staff were friendly though.
3
Place is very cosy and atmosphere is very good. Nice view. Food is a little bit pricey, but good portion
4
Great place for some family bonding time or catching up with friends. The staff are attentive despite it being full house and also observant towards families with children.
5
Overall pleasant experience. Good food. Pizza not too bad. Found the teriyaki pizza too sweet to my liking. Cheeseburger is nice according to my boy. Finish up with no problem.
5
Overall excellent experience. My hubby and I loves it a lot! Especially the maple bacon burger was really exceeded our expectation. Top up $2 for truffle sauce and it was really good. Salmon salad was very fresh as well. We both rated quite high for their food and ambience.
2
A friend suggested I try out this place so I went online to refer to the menu. Their website did not provide any so I went to their Facebook and saw some pictures- not helpful enough.So I went there earlier to have a read at their physical menu...ordered a Mushroom Burger, Salted Egg wings, Mentaiko fries and a honey lime drink of sorts. Yes it was a busy Sunday but no reason to not turn on the aircon. After 1hour of being indoor seating, I was having half a mind to change to outdoor as it was windy. The mushroom burger was overly salty and horrible. Salted Egg wings and the drink were nondescript. Only Mentaiko fries with chicken floss (recommended by a female staff) was very good - hence my rating of 2 out of 5. Otherwise it would just be a 1. Plain water was a scarce resource over at our table- I had to ask for refill when other tables got free flow without having to even lift a finger.I also doggy bagged a HarJeongGai burger which the service staff said he can hold back cooking it until we are ready to leave. So we chit chatted for about 2.5hours and by then, the service staff was already looking impatiently over our table every 20mins.All in all, not a pleasant dining experience and will not recommend to anyone.
1
Heard about this food joint and went there for lunch last Sunday for a try. To say I was disappointed was fair as the service was so poor. The staff who showed us to the table and give us the menu and the waitress who took our order and served us did not even try to conjure up a smile or a lively tone of voice. We joked about how they must be too cool to smile. Everything was done with little interest and I felt I was intruding them somehow. It was grouchy face all around with no eye contact. We initially wanted to stay for dessert and coffee but decided to leave as we would rather not see their faces anymore. The cashier was slightly friendly but did not even thank us when he returned the credit card. How ridiculous! The food was fair, not great and definitely not something I would come back for. The service totally repelled us and I would highly recommend to all my family and friends to wisely spend our money elsewhere. Yikes. To me, its byeee tata Grub!
3
Was there for get-together with colleague & an oversea friend for breakfast. Initially service was quite ok as it's not super crowded but when it gets more crowded, find the service was abit below average.Food was average but great ambiance for chill-out/catch up though. Cakes was not bad too
5
Ordered the Teriyaki chicken pizza (didn't finish and packed away, tasted very good the next day), Chilli crab pasta (spiciness level comparable to Mcspicy), double cheeseburger and Mentaiko fries (good!). The order was served within 10 minutes.
4
Portions are rather large for the fish and chips. The battered fish is rather thick. Would have prefer it to be 2 thinner slices instead of a large chunk. The drinks were good. Especially like the earl grey lychee tea.
5
beautiful way to start the day eating indoors but feeling lie the great outdoors! grub in a par. awesome. food good as always. service staff very polite and friendly.
5
Been to grub quite a number of times. The burgers and fries are my go-to food there if I am not sure of what to eat. The pastas are also quite good.
4
Good place to chill and have times to catch up with family / buddies / friends. Recommended for Makan.
5
Second time to Grub. Food was as expected. Service was good and the food came out in a timely fashion.
5
reserved a table for my friends and I, staff was friendly and service is good, although i thought that some dishes-like the ebi pasta can use an overhaul. stick to the basics and use creamy mentaiko sauce as a base, omit the shrimps-there are too many, and it will taste good
4
Made a reservation for indoor seats and glad we did because it was a scorching hot morning. Staff were polite but it was a really busy Saturday morning hence it seems that the restaurant was a little understaffed. Popular place for families and lots of screaming toddlers, not the best place if you are looking for a relaxing breakfast.
4
Made a reservation using Chope. Ordered the Sakura Shrimp Pasta and Har Cheong Kai Burger. Both dishes were delicious. Had the Yuzi Mint soda which was refreshing. Staff were attentive and polite. But restaurant looked under staff. Quite full and only 2 staff serving. kudos to those 2 on duty. Went on a Monday night
5
Had a great experience at grub - went there as I had some vouchers. Food was value for money n service was excellent. Waiter was kind enough to inform us that our vouchers were for 4 pax n advised us to take away some food as only 2 of us went!
5
Good service with good atmosphere. Happen to have live band as well. We will definitely visit again.
4
Food and ambiance is good for gathering with friends. The service there is good too. Additional points is that can get discount vouchers from chope website :)
3
The environment looks very inviting and good place to brunch with friends. But food standard can be better. Tried the breakfast plate and salmon smoked plate. Breakfast plate was not served hot. Don't mind trying again but having other food on the menu.
4
Ordered Grub breakfast and burger. The coffee was decently served. The food were average with good portion but still considered place that I will be back to try out more. The price was pretty fair.
4
It was raining when I visited the cafe thus it provided me an cosy ambience. The food was of reasonable portion and taste was flavoursome.
4
Friendly n cheerful service staff. Food portion came as expected. Would be nice if they could serve hot warm lemon water.
5
It was our 2nd time here after a long time, yet we were still satisfied with the food. The Chilli Crab Pasta, Salted Egg Chicken Wings and of course the Cheeseburger. It is a very nice place to dine at the park. Though you would still need to walk from the parking lot, it is really worth it. They server as well pizza and desserts. The burger was really satisfying, it was juicy and delicious. It is complemented with a very nice bun and Monterrey jack cheese. The salted egg chicken wings is very good as well. The sauce is not too strong which blends well with the chicken. The chilli crab pasta has a soft shell crab which was deep fried so it is crispy. It compliments well the pasta with the sauce. Lastly, the service crew was on the spot. They provide excellent service to their customers. We would definitely be back here
3
Initially we thought Grub is closed due to there is a private event held there, but lucky we are still able to occupy the outdoor seating at the corner. This cafe is located in Bishan Ang Mo Kio Park, it is easier accessible through Bishan side and you have to walk further from Ang Mo Kio. Sitting in outdoor seating is more hot, they do serve cold water. We have ordered pork floss truffle fries, prawn paste chicken burger, mushroom pasta. We roughly waited 20 mins for our food to arrive, the pasta is too dry, the ha chong gai burger is too salty, so far only the pork floss truffle fries taste good. Although the cafe served unique food, but then it is not as good. Not really recommended unless you are in Bishan Park and you can probably visit
4
I was there with my friends for a late breakfast. The ambience of the cafe was good, situated in bishan park. There were lots of family who bring their little children to dine there (probably after a stroll at the park). The food was good, generous portion and tasty. However, if you go earlier than 12pm, there is only limited choice of food which is served - only burgers and breakfast platter. We wanted to try the pizza and pasta but was told that they only serve it after 12pm. So, if you are looking for food variety, do remember to take note that it is better to go after 12pm.
4
Great selection of local infused burgers. I myself orders the chilli soft shell crab pasta. It was delicious, not overly hot but enough kick. Good size meals, very tasty.For drinks there is a selection of beers, ciders and soft drinks. No wine selection. Restaurant mainly frequented by locals which is a great sign
4
Service crew was friendly and food was nice. The mentaiko fries was superb as it always is. Perhaps can try to launch smaller version of the pizza so we can try more things each visit.
5
Went there on a Chope deal. Fuss free booking and appreciated that they could let me use the Chope vouchers on eve of Mother's Day. Nice food!
5
Ordered ribeye steak welldone but it was still bloody. Nevertheless, food was okay. Also ordered mentaiko fries as usual.
4
Food is great and the ambience is cosy. Although it is in the middle of a park, there is a carpark nearby.
3
The food is average only - we got served cold fries. :( but atmosphere is good as it is located within the park.
5
Staff allowed us to be seated even though we were an hour early . Food and drinks was served quickly.
4
not the place to have pizza, burgers are ok but probably the top choice for this place would be the pasta dishes
2
On the menu, it says that the pizza dough is "hand stretched." We assumed that they would "hand stretch" the dough in their kitchen, but NO, they get the doughs from a bakery where the baker would hand-stretch the doughs. But the dough tastes just like those microwave pizzas. Even the toppings were not good quality to justify the price ($22 above). We were so shocked by the quality of the dough, so we asked them such questions. They at least asked us if we would choose another dish (but of course, we paid for it..). My hubby said that he would have the burger, and we thought they would bring us the menu to choose which burger, but they gave us a beef pasta. We didn't want to make a big deal at the restaurant, so we just said that we would take the pasta, but even the pasta was just ok. Nothing special about it. For french fries, it was ok, but fries at McDonald's taste better. On their wall, it says that they would sell food that they would serve to their families, and I don't see it in their place. But iced mocha and some lemon drink were good. They were served quick, too. Maybe we will drop by again for some drinks, but never for food items.
4
I went there with my Boyfriend, it's our third visit to the cafe as we love their burgers! Definitely must try the mentaiko fries, it's Super addictive. Also there were musicians which made the atmosphere really lively and vibrant. Lastly, the staff were friendly and attentive. Will definitely be back for more burgers and fries!
4
A surprisingly cost restaurant tuck away in beautiful Bishan park. Lots of spaces for energetic kids to run about n a lake by the restaurant. Only down side is the air conditioning portion is too limited and one has to suffer the hot n humid environment if u r late. Mid day sun could be quite unbearable. Management could improved on maintenance e.g fan is not working, toilet tap is not workingFood is good though
3
Food was good but was disappointed in service. Didn't seem like they were understaffed but it was so difficult to get their attention.
5
Nice atmosphere with grear food. Recommended to buy voucher on chope to save a bit. :) returned customer
5
It was my wife's birthday, and we went out for a breakfast in the park amidst birdsong, fresh air and great food!
4
Nice place to sit & chill after a walk in d park! Enjoyed the Mentaiko fries & preferred to sit outside rather than indoors- less reverberation, especially if u want to have a decent conversation w friends. Do try the lychee tea!
4
Ambience: Love the surrounding of the restaurant, just that the address is not well defined and hard to find the place.
Food: Excellent food, really tasty food.
Price: For the quality of food, it is well worth it.
5
We were a large group consisting of 17 adults and 15 children. We enjoyed the delicious food brought to us at great value, and the ambience was fantastic! Live band was performing soulful music at its best!
5
Came here after a nice walk through the park.I had the cheeseburger.OMG it was fantastic!Tasty beef, juicy in a nice soft chewy bun.Also came with fries on the side.Very satisfying.Yes service was slow.But once you got their attention they were very helpful and efficient. Not a deal breaker
5
Went on a Saturday evening expecting there to be a slight queue in front (that's why I booked). It was surprisingly too crowded! New seats were included since the last time I was there (back in Aug 2015) and the ambience is as chill as I remembered it. We ordered the har cheong gai burger and the chilli crab pasta. The meat in the burger was huge. Only problem we had was the top bun which was toasted till it was TOO crispy such that we made a mess eating it :( The chilli crab pasta had the perfect amount of spices, although the soft shell crab had a slight smell (which some people might not like).I knew the price would be a little pricey, so doing this once in a while is a treat :)Staff were friendly and accommodating. Their cheerfulness added to my wonderful experience
3
This used to be one of my fav to go place for an awesome portobello mushroom burger! That was 2 years back - recently I went back to satisfy my Portobello mushroom burger cravings and was sorely disappointed. It was bland and tasteless, and the same goes for my friend's har chiong kai burger. Definitely won't be returning till they do something about it.
3
When I first visited Grub 2 years ago, their portobello mushroom burger was #1 to me! Comparing to all the portebello mushroom burgers from other restaurants. Recently went back, and boy was I disappointed! Either the recipe changed or the chef changed.. the burger was bland and tasteless. My friend felt the same way about her har chiong kai burger :/
4
Great ambience, situated at a lovely quiet corner of Bishan Park. Food was pretty good too; the Har Cheong Gai burger is a MUST try when you visit! Thumbs up.
5
Great location for us to bring our 2 kids along for an enjoyable family brunch. Service was good and they serve their food quite fast. Portion of the food were quite alright as well. Relax environment since it is located within a park.
4
Have returned to Grub on several occasions, and i enjoy the natural lighting in the cafe. The food is reasonably priced and delicious.
4
Situated in tranquil Bishan park. Nice place to take the kids out for a good burger. Service is also good, cheerful and attentive staff. Will be back.
5
This place is very popular, make sure to reserve a table in advance or you will face a 40 min queue.
4
Staff was attentive. The food was served fast. The food was good. It was an enjoyable dinner. Would visit it again.
5
The ubiquitous Grub cheeseburger with add ons of caramelised onions n sautéed mushroom certainly hit the spot! Went down well with Mango beer and strawberry mango soda.
Tasty freshly prepared food, obliging staff and pleasant park ambience....what's not to like?
5
It was my third experience and no doubt it was even better. Booked via chope and when we arrived, there were only outdoor seats however, the staff managed to get an indoor seat for us due to the heat outside. While ordering, the staffs at the cashier even suggested to us a new sauce (truffled flavoured) for us to dip in with our fries and it was great :)
4
Bishan AMK park has some NYC Central Park atmosphere. Grub is nicely located. Ideal if you want a peaceful dinner.Food is nice. The employees were very nice but coordination made them struggle with reactivity of service. Wondering if they were short of manpower or perhaps some of them need some training. But they made it up with a good attitude
3
Together with husband and son, we went to Grub for lunch on a weekday.Compared with our last visit, we found that the beef patty was less juicy and succulent than before. While the fries were good, the serving was ALOT which may be a wastage. Prawns used were frozen, not fresh prawns :
4
Grub continues to serve up consistently good grub in a tranquil setting. Great for catching up with friends.
5
They were very generous with the portions and the food was very good too! friendly and helpful staff :)
3
Had their cheese burger and the bottom bun was super soggy. The patty was alright but wasn't as good as the last I had.
3
The service and ambience is better than the taste of the food. Frankly, not worth the $$$. I went there to to enjoy the relax surrounding.
5
Nice place to chill and relax beside the park and a walk can be done after dinner and parking was also convenient
4
Ordered our Favourite Har Cheong Kai burger and shrimp pasta. Super nice! Tried their new salted egg chicken wing. Delicious!
4
Slightly inaccessible as restaurant is located in the middle of the park. Food is as good as it looks!
3
The food here was rather average, helped only by the park surroundings. We had the Sakura Ebi Pasta and Har Cheong Gai Burger. The Pasta was rather dry and not really tasty, Har Cheong Gai Burger didn't really have the taste I expected of prawn paste chicken. Drinks wise the Lychee Earl Grey tea was rather refreshing while I think the Rose Gold Latte's foam looked really arty. Great place for a discussion or chat over a drink. Might be back to try the cakes which I missed, but not the food
4
It was a great location for dining while surrounded by greenery. Ordered the grilled chicken burger and the patty was generously thick, yet cooked to juicy perfection at the same time. Only thing that was lacking was the burger bun, could definitely be better. Chili soft shell crab pasta was yummy too, sauce was adequately spicy and spaghetti was cooked al dente. Ordered the iced lemon earl grey tea and it was bitter and meh... slice of rainbow cake was slightly frozen and not worth the calories... but still a great experience with the savoury food anyhow!

Love the ambience of the place. Set inside Bishan Park, it's lovely to sit outside on a cool afternoon or evening and enjoy a good meal and coffee. It almost feels like you're out of Singapore. The food is really good, and very great value for money. Nothing over $20. I had the fish and chips as well as the sakura ebi pasta, and both were great tasting. The appetisers of mentaiko fries, as well as salted egg wings was great too. Staff were friendly enough, but gives you space to relax and enjoy the peace. Love sitting there on the off-days and enjoying a good coffee, some nibbles and a good book (when it's not crowed of course!
4
Nice place! I went for casual dinner on a weekday. Food was decent and tasty. More selections on the menu would be great.
4
Burgers were good, fries were pretty decent.
The only thing holding back a full 5/5 for Grubs would be its portion of food provided. Fat Boys offers more filling burgers at relatively similar prices.
2
mentaiko fries is not as good as chicken floss fries. depending on where you sit, may not be able to see the band on sat nights
4
What a great alternative to having a meal with friends right in the heart of a beautiful public park. The burger selection is good and it's worth the stop if you're out and about in the area.
4
Must try their chili crab pasta! It's awesome! Their iced coffee is normal. Earlgrey lychee tea is nice.
5
The above is the main reason l keep going back to them. Can't find other authentic hand made beef patty anywhere else. Best place to satisfy my cravings for Cheese Burger. Go for double if you can!
5
Food is great and reasonably priced. The staff were very courteous and attentive. We love this place and will definitely visit here again.
3
Very friendly staff and bright ambience for group gathering.Food-wise...only the burger (we ordered the delux cheese) is juicy and yummy.The dinner special, pork belly, is tender but not soft enough. And the sweet potato mash is way too sweet. The steak is just so so, and the pasta is over cooked (we like it al-dente). The chicken burger is kinda like KFC zinger....tasty but no oohmp
4
Nestled in the edge of Bishan Park, this place will provide you and your friends/family a great dining experience! I came for dinner at 5.30pm and within 10 minutes, 1/2 the restaurant is filled. First, the food. The menu is interesting - with the emphasis on burgers. However, I am captivated by their Seaweed Sakura Ebi Prawn Pasta (with a hint of Mentaiko Sauce). It was tasty. And I also had Mentaiko Fries - it came hot! I love anything with Mentaiko! I also ordered their signature Yuzu Mint Soda - which is a tad more bitter than I would like , but still pretty refreshing! My hubby's $19 Ribeye (200g) is really value for money.
5
Who knew that a restaurant in the middle of a park would be such a tasty treat? Grub sits in the middle of Bishan Park and offers burgers of beef, chicken, and har gai prawn (pungent shrimp paste) that are absolutely beautiful in presentation. Each burger is served with fries, but you can exchange them for salad when you order mentaiko fries, which are absolutely delicious. For those who don't need a burger bun, there is also grilled chicken steak on the menu that comes with grilled mushrooms and yummy mashed sweet potatoes. The only catch is that you need to take a bus or taxi to Bishan Park to find the restaurant, but it's totally worth it
4
Food and beer was good. The fries is very crispy and nice. The pork steak burger was good too. Service is not too bad as they still provide paper and coloring pencil to entertain the kids. Overall pleasant experience.
4
Good location with carpark available. Service was prompt and food was served within 5 mins of ordering.
5
Had dinner here with 3 friends. Service was prompt and servers were friendly. A rare pleasure in singapore. Great experience. Will be back!
4
friendly staff, fast service and food was served hot. we enjoy dining there because of the location.
4
Went to try their brunch on a Sunday. Food was good, service is fine too overall. Their mentaiko fries must order! :)
4
Tasty food. Ordered and loved the mentai fries, ebi pasta and mushroom cheeseburger. God for a quick lunch in the park.
4
Went over to GRUB for our anniversary dinner with my husband. Its our second visit here after about 2 years. Food and service has improved greatly and the environment was fantastic.
4
Good experience lunch at Grub. Cleanness need to be improve as there still some dusty for the shop window and table.
3
Located on the "other" end of Bishan Park, it avoids competition from the other cafes that are nearer to Bishan Central. FoodWe had a smoked salmon plate and breakfast plate, quality of food was good (better than the other cafe in Bishan Park) Service They told us the inside seating was full, but after we negotiated they told us actually there's an empty table inside. So was it just to conveniently place us outside?Then we waited what seemed like 30mins for the food. When we went to check, they realised they forgot our order. To be fair, they were very apologetic about it and offered us free Churros (which was delicious, hot and crispy) and moved us to a bigger table when the crowd has cleared. VerdictWould I visit again? Probably yes, can give them a second and last chance for poor service. Food was good and they made a decent service recovery.
5
Made a reservation at 11am for brunch on Saturday with my gf. Was given a reminder call a day before to confirm reservation. The place is quaint and it being in the middle of bishan park makes it a scenic location to dine. Staff were very accomodating, and allowed for side dish change (from fries to salad, so we could order fries as a side dish). The food was good and we had a good time.
5
Food served was good and above my expectations. Staff there were friendly and prompt with their service.
5
Easy redemption, went at 6pm on a friday and we were the first. Crowd came in after 6.30pm. Just show voucher and that's it! Cool.
4
Their pasta and burgers are tasty. Be caution of the Chilli crab pasta, it's spicy. The churros taste good esp their dips, but good for sharing with many --- too heavy even for 4 of us to share after dinner.
4
Instead of mesh potato, they serve mesh sweet potato. The thought of it was not very appealing but it was surprisingly rather tasty and went well with the main.
3
My bf and I had burgers and ciders only, overall it was ok , will come back to try the pasta! Service was good, nothing to complain about :)
5
Love the cheese burger here. Fulfilling meal. Great indoors ambience. Big tip: To reserve in advance. Even on a weekday evening, it was full house!
3
Grub in Bishan Park is an average cafe with food so dried as they do not believe on Sauce . It's not a cafe that you would want to go back again
3
Decided to try out this place since Chope had the $10 Visa offer in the month of October.Reached about 7:30pm on a Friday evening and the place was crowded, we decided to sit outdoor due to the cooling weather. Ambience was good, good for chilling out with friends and love ones. Ordered Salted Chicken Wings & Mentaiko Fries which my BF and I felt that it was kind of a disappointment. Salted Chicken Wings was rather soggy that crispy and Mentaiko fries taste nothing but ordinary. We decided to go try out one of their recommended burger - Portobello Burger. BF thought that it was good but personally, thought that it was rather off standard considering that they are famous for their burger (or perhaps The Fat Boys has already set a benchmark for good burger for my tastebud).Saw that a lot of people tried their pasta, perhaps will be back to give it a try (or maybe not)
5
Grub is a merely 15 - 20 minutes walk from our place but all the walking and sweating will be worth it, the good surroundings while walking through Bishan Park is nice you see people jogging, walking and playing games is really amusing and it also helps you prepare for the awesome food that you would have after the walk.Churros,I always make it a point to order these everytime we visit, I prefer the white chocolate dip more than the other but I still love it...we asked them to serve it together with our mains which could be a good idea because you still have space in your tummy but bad since you could only take a few bites and move on to your mains...and of course it will get cold once you decided to have a few more, the choice is yours... but this is definitely a must order item.Truffle Bacon Baked Eggs This is another must order item, so creamy and seasoned just right. I don't know how to describe it all I can say is when you take the first spoonful you will be going... Hmmmmmm and awwwww!!Pasta...the chili crab..pasta is al dente, the sauce is sweet and spicy seasoned nicely..soft shell crab was great!Their service is always great..friendly, attentive
5
Went down on a Tuesday, mid noon so there were not many people in the cafe. Ordered sakura ebi pasta and mushroom pasta, the portions were ample and they were very generous with the ingredients. Pastas were cooked al dente and I especially enjoyed the sakura ebi pasta which had umami flavour. The servers were friendly. Enjoyed dining in the relaxing environment
5
Perfect place for catch up sessions with friends. Good ambience and food complimented by good service.
4
went on weekday lunch with a good friend. We enjoyed the food - serving is generous - and not so crowded, so we can have a nice long chat after food.
5
Perfect ambience, tasty brunch! Good customer service and affordable! Keep up the good work and continue to excel
4
I'd chosen grub for a quick dinner simply because it was nearby. I hadn't expected good food and good service.
4
The taste of prawn paste fried chicken didnt really blend in well with the salted egg sauce. The pork burger is tender and nice.
5
It was a good experience dining within the park. The atmosphere was heartwarming with both indoor and outdoor seating and food was great too.
4
Good ambience and surrounding located with Bishan/AMK park. Food quality was good without MSG. Only complaint was the automated booking call back service which will repeatedly call you until you have answered and prompt the booking confirmation, which was a nuisance. Cheryl from Grub handled the sticky situation admirably and must be commended. Will definitely return
5
We had the Sakura ebi pasta and the pesto prawn pasta. Love that all the ingredients used were fresh and not from a can. The Sakura ebi pasta is one of the best pastas I've eaten. Great restaurant in a park. Good for brunch after your morning walks/jogs
4
After a nice long walk and some good play time with my daughter we landed in the restaurant. .nice ambience and spacious, quick service and pleasant staff. .we ordered grilled chicken burger and portobello burger. .the veg burger was just OK. Drinks were nice. .we had icy lemon fizz which was ample to quench the thust. One suggestion for the cafe is to increase the veg options in the menu.
5
Had an impromptu brunch with my lovely wife and pretty princess. GRUB was our choice and I never regret it. It has undergone a mini renovation so inside seating is more spacious. Food was served fast and quality was just nice. Cannot expect atas high quality for the price we are paying. But it is definitely value for money. My princess loved their rainbow cake. I had a bite, it was certainly not too bad.Will definitely return for a urge visit
5
The environment was peaceful and relaxing. Staffs were friendly and the food were well arranged and taste great. Over all, I do recommend you to go
4
My friend & I had a lovely Sunday Brunch at GRUB. The young lady who attended to us deserves special mention for her friendly & helpful service throughout our visit.
4
The dining experience was the same as I last visited. The food was ok. Service can be better. Because of the environment, I would still recommend to friends to dine at Grub.
4
They serve special food which you can't find outside. Taste good as well. But for cafe price, it considers near to the expensive side. Worth the value overall.
3
Went for brunch on a Saturday at about 10.30am. The place was pretty empty and so we could choose the seats we wanted.Ordered a grub breakfast plate and my friend tried the fish burger. I thought my breakfast plate was mediocre but my friend quite liked her fish burger (which was recommended by the staff serving us - thank you).I myself tried both the mocha and the latte - both were quite alright but not great, sadly
5
It was my first brunch experience at Grub, I ordered the fish burger. The portion was so satisfying as well as the taste. Thereafter, I enjoyed a glass of ice mocca and churros for dessert. Good food and ambiance, however I suggest to make booking in advance.
3
We visited Grub after our first visit when it first opened 3 yrs ago.The food was still as good as we remembered.Unfortunatly the staff were very young and spent more time on their phones than tending to the customers.The place was very cold and asked on 2 occasions for the Air Con to be turned down.Eventually we went outside to get warm.The final bill was expensive with GST sevice tax and ++Not in a rush bac
4
Grub is located at the heart of Bishan Park 1. It is a relaxing feel to dine among the greenery. I will suggest to dine indoors as the sun can be pretty overwhelming during the day. Beef bolognese was a good portion. A little too salty for my taste bud though
3
We worked up an appetite after our stroll on Friday 5ish pm. Reach cafe around 6pm and there were ample seats. We ordered the mentako(?) fries to share and had 1 burger each. We were really hungry. Service was prompt, our food was served pretty quick. Fries were delicious. Not as good as PS cafe's truffle fries but not bad and quite interesting flavor. Double cheese burger is good but I feel that my har chiong gai burger is too salty. Serving size is bigger than average so if you have a small appetite, I would recommend to share. Would recommend to go back for beef burgers and fries.
2
Giving this place a low rating because of their unfair treatment of customers. We heard good reviews of Grub through our other expat friends in Singapore so gave them a call to make a reservation for 2. We were told that they DID NOT take reservations and seating is on a first-come-first-served basis. No issues, we made our way down on a Saturday for brunch and actually had a good time with the food and service. We did one more visit for a weekend brunch a few weeks later and again had an enjoyable meal. The 3rd time however was our last time. When my wife and I arrived there was only 1 table unoccupied (right beside the entrance where they receive guests). The waiter who received us said we will have to wait outside until a party leaves. There clearly wasn't a single table in sight who looked like they were leaving in the next 5-10 minutes so we pointed to the free table right beside us and asked if we could be seated there. However to our surprise he said "no, that table is reserved and you will have to wait!". I did tell him that when we called we were told Grub did not take reservations so how is it that you are telling us now that a table is reserved? He had no answer but to keep repeating that the table was reserved. By the way there was no reserved sign placed on the table and he wouldn't even tell us what time it was reserved for (in case we could sit and they could clear another table for the reserved party in the next 10 minutes) . So Grub turned away 2 paying customers who had travelled 45 minutes to get there, rather than show some flexibility and common sense. Shame
5
Food is great! Innovative menu! Love the burgers. Nice place in the midst of Bishan park. Service is great!
5
The food is great and nice atmosphere. great for couples and even for families. Their menu is freshly prepared upon ordring using only the finest ingredients
5
Pretty satisfied experience. Service staff were friendly and helpful. Try the mentaiko fries. chope voucher can be used on the same day. Brilliant!
5
Staff were attentive to needs and service was fast. Great atmosphere by the park and food was value for money. Would visit again!
4
Great place to stop by while on a trip to the park. Food is ok with some really good ones like the slow cooked pork belly and ebi pasta. Service staff always friendly and helpful
4
The location of the restaurant is within the park which makes it pretty cool. It's a small restaurant which provides outdoor and indoor dining. The atmosphere is pretty nice on the inside but it's really small and doesn't have much seating space as compared to the outside, so big groups might need to make reservations before heading down. Food were pretty good but the restaurant definitely needs more wait staff as the existing ones were quite overwhelmed by the Sunday dinner crowd
4
Was warmly welcomed right upon arrival and whilst looking at menu, decided to change to outdoor seating as I was starting to feel unwell. Waitress quickly accommodated with an offer to bring me some water immediately. She also recommended the National Day specials which was really good. When I explained I didn't finish the chilli crab pasta, which had a surprising zesty sour taste, due to my chronic gastric condition & didn't want the chef to be offended, she apologised and returned with an offer for me to have a dessert on the house. All in all, the impeccable service, which was warm and intimate without being intrusive, absolutely made up for me not being able to savour the food in full capacity. I was so impressed with the service I tipped the waitress personally. I'll be sure to return once I'm back to the pink of health. P.s. The mentaiko fries is to die for.
3
Decided to pay a visit to this eatery in the luscious Bishan Park since we happened to be around the MacRitchie area. Gratitude goes to our waitress who kindly reminded us to switch our fries to a salad, seeing that we had ordered the Mentaiko Fries too (which was sprinkled with lotsa seaweed! Yay!). The Har Cheong Gai Burger was quite unique, with its fluffy buns & crispy chicken. Chili Crab Pasta gave a good kick with its sweet & slightly spicy sauce. Couldn't taste much of the earl grey in the Lychee Earl Grey tea though. Would have gave a higher score if not for the dirty toilets, which kinda put you off after a good meal. Good place to sit back & have a bite among nature
3
Due to construction surrounds, we almost missed out this place. Our 2nd time here. Food is nice as usual, nice ambience but a tad too noisy. Quick dinner with the hub. We ordered Grub cheese burger & Earl Grey lemon tea (me), Grub double cheese burger & root beer float (the hub),
3
Generally food is good, but while the burgers are in generous proportion, some are not (like the pork belly which is made up of only 4(?) chunks of the pork and lots of sweet potato desperately hoping to make up for the lack of protein); price is ok; the restaurant itself if simple but quite nice, surrounded by good landscape in the middle of the park (take note, it's "inside" bishan park), meaning you have to schedule your trip to the place if you wanna go there.called in a week before to make reservation (as ours was a party of 20-30), lady who answered the call said manager will call to get more details (like exact number). the next day no call so i call again, another lady answered and confirmed the reservation & said that manager was off duty so will call when back to work. no calls until the day of reservation. and so to my surprise (shock!) when we came, there is no reservation in their system! of course it meant we had to wait longer cramped in limited tables available at the time! (and worse, the guy tried to ask 1 family if ok for them to move to another table for their dessert! i would have told him not to ask if he told me he's gonna do it, i said we will wait for available tables!). and yeah, no discount or anything for compensation, not even candies for the kids who waited so long for their food! (com'on man! i'm quite familiar with f&b biz).But again, food is quite good, fast service by (some) almost rude staff
3
Perfect brunch location as its in the middle of the park, but the food was quite average. The mac n cheese was a complete disappointment.
4
Dinner at Grub was great (experience of dining in a park).
Food is good, value for money.
Only thing: a bit inaccessible and noisy.
4
Very relaxed dining experience among the greens and there is even live singing to add to the atmosphere.
3
Nice place with good service. Pity them didnt have eggs benedict. Ordered their breakfast - though quality was good but was not worth the price.
4
A relaxing place for weekday lunch with friends and family. The Sakura ebi linguine and the ha cheong gai burger were delicious and the dessert chocolate choax that came the lunch set was yummilicious.
4
Great place to chill and catch up with friends over coffee, tea or alcohol. We ordered salted egg chicken, mango and prawn salad for appetiser, steak with fries and pork belly as main, soda and tea for drinks. Quite a lot for two ladies but we finished it because it was so yummy! Fries was served separately in a cup so it doesn't get soggy by the sauce and you can finish it later while chatting. You can skip the chicken wings. The service was fantastic (maybe being friendly helps). They staff refilled my tea twice. The place was crowded on a Wednesday evening. Go early or secure your reservation first. A downside is, dinner was quite pricy at $70 and the place is difficult to locate as Bishan Park is not exactly small and there are not many signs to direct you over. Take it as exercise, enjoy the walk and air while you are there. Good place for parents and children too
4
Mentaiko fries with a dash of nori seafood were appetizing prior to the main course. However, the portion was a bit too little. For main course, we ordered the sambal seafood pasta and chilli crab pasta. The gravy for both pasta were superb with a tinge of spiciness. Not forgetting the crispy soft shell crab that come with the pasta. As for dessert, we ordered the all-time favourite, Ondeh Ondeh cake and chocolate chiffon cake. They were indeed unique and enjoyable to indulge in. Overall, our dining experience in Grub was pleasant with attentive and friendly staff.
2
For a burger place, it's quite shocking that they ran out of fries for weekend brunch. The other alternatives were salad and toasts (burgers and toasts?), which we opted for the salad, but the dressing was too sour. The breakfast platter was not too bad though. Also, they should consider having bottled water in their menu.
4
4 of us visited the restaurant for brunch on a Sunday.Do make a reservation ahead to avoid being on the "waiting list" as a "walk-in".The restaurant played 80s/90s music which appealed to me.Two items in the menu that stood out was the truffle bacon baked eggs and "har cheong gai" burger.The former was a nice combination dish with cheese melted in. Great to have with toasted bread.The latter is a piece of chicken meat seasoned with prawn-paste or "belachan paste", & fried. "Har Cheong Gai" as a dish is commonly found in the menu of a heartland coffee shop. The words "har" (or prawn), "cheong' (gravy or paste), "gai" (chicken) in the Cantonese dialect.This is the 1st time I have ever tried a "har cheong kai" burger.Brunch Set options are also available during weekends only.Do have a look at them.The crew was vibrant and polite.A cosy place for a leisurely brunch meal :)A tasty experience
2
Considering they are open at 9am, you would think Grub is a breakkie/brunch joint but their menu only boast 2 breakfast items which are both quite similar. We went on a day where there wasn't even coffee because the machine is broken. You would think it is the fundamental requirement of a cafe no? We order both their breakfast items and were sorely disappointed. The sausages (processed food) had no flavor and scrambled eggs doesn't even compare to Macdonalds. The entire plate looks slapped together by pre cooked items. Then we ordered a baked truffle eggs with mushrooms. I struggled and failed to taste any truffle or eggs for that matter and the presentation looked like my leftover dinner from the night before. But the service staff are pretty friendly.
4
Food portion was just nice. Well cooked. Staff were attentive and helpful. Would visit there again!!
4
We sat outdoors. Loved the ambiance. The service was excellent as the staff were polite and attentive.
5
The place is nice, the lighting and glass house. Looking warm and classic . The food is good and portion is good for one.
4
More like isolated from town but yet still in town, it is very chilling and find a piece of quietness.
4
Went Grub for brunch. It's so happen it's Grub three year old birthday celebration! Amosphere was lively and there is even a playground set up for kids to play.
5
Great place to hang out with friends and family. Never knew such a place existed. Right inside Bishan park, amazing! Great food, excellent value! Love the $3 half pint beer, fantastic value!
4
It's my 2nd time to visit Grub, and it was a nice experience! Food was great! We will definitely comeback!
3
Bolognese pasta was just okay. Beef steak was not done well. Not soft enough, hard to cut, too many tendons inside the meat too.Root beer float was served separately as root beer & ice cream on a cup of ice. doesn't quite make sense. Chocolate chiffon cake was not soft and fluffy enough. Taste almost like a normal cake with some chocolate icing. Definitely not worth $7. Might only go back for the churros. At least the chocolate sauces are decent and churros are nicely done. Recommend to go on rainy days as 1) no crowd, served fast 2) no mosquitoe
5
Visit GRUB as a Sunday brunch.This cafe is located in Bishan Ang Mo Kio park so not convenient for the one not living there.Most of time many people but you can find seat with in 10 minutes they call you when seat available.Hamburger in here is very juicy also bread is good. I think this is best hamburger in SG
4
We decided to have dinner here on Sunday so we called up and made a reservation for 6pm (dinners now have to be at a baby friendly timing...). We rocked up on time and the place was already buzzing packed with people getting their grub on. Was shown to a table by the friendly wait staff and we proceeded to scan the menu. Ordered ourselves a mushroom soup for the baby, double cheese burger and a steak for the grownups. Took a while for the water to arrive (I am guessing that's because it was busy) but the food came promptly. The soup was want you would expect, full of mushroomy goodness and the accompanying bread was actually quite surprisingly tasty. Only comment I could say about the soup would be that it could have been served a little bit hotter, it was luke warm when it arrived. The burger (although temperature was not taken, not a stickler but some people might be) was big, juicy and filling. The steak was pretty good too, with it being cooked just as requested. Had a couple of beers (the wheat beer on tap is commendable) and a yuzu mint soda thing (which I didn't try so I can't comment on that) and an order of churros (which in my opinion, was the only down side to the meal) cost us a little under $100. All in all a decent dining experience. Nice burgers, good beers and a good view of the Bishan AMK Park with reasonable prices to boot. Will come back for sure.
4
Good food and fresh ingredient served.
friendly workers who always serve with smiles.
surrounded by scenery view ...
4
Cafe in a garden - there's really not many of such places in Singapore. Bishan is a great location - after a sumptious meal, a good place to walk off some of the food.
5
Really enjoyed myself. The people there are very nice too. Very friendly and helpful. The place was not that hard to get to.
4
Apart from mosquitoes, it was a great to chill out on a weekday with your friends. I especially enjoyed the draft beer and churros. Thank you Grub!
2
The guide of the location not really lead me the way to destination. The shop close too early as on Saturday night.
4
The service staff were attentive and responsive. Beer and alcohol is reasonably price but food is just average. More room for improvement for dessert. Great place for gathering and chill out though.
3
Not much of choices of food. Service wise still need to improve. Indoor dining area limited. Alfresco area quite ok. Overall, everything was just ok.
3
Finally I got to go to Grub given that I have walked in Bishan Park constantly over the past year and have always wondered what the food is like - I had a meal here with my better half this past week. Our meals sadly, were pretty average and nothing to get excited about; a prawn pasta dish and pork dish very plainly served and whilst 'alright' it was not enough to make me want to order them again. The service was not the best despite the waiters being polite and courteous. We ordered drinks first up, but my partner's beer took forever and we had to ask them twice to follow it up. Our meals did not come out together and the second one took quite a while. I would consider this place as being good for a cheap beer and a burger meal because the restaurant itself is very basic and burgers seem to be their 'thing' - they looked alright anyway as they were being taken to the tables around us. They serve ciders as well, but no wine so to be fair, it really is a more casual eating place. If you are looking for ambiance and a more special night out, then this bare block of concrete of a restaurant which uses the park for ambiance, is not the solution
4
Heard great reviews of Grub and when I finally got the chance to visit the place, I got to say I was impressed with how great the food was! Setting was casual with raw interior design that give patrons a laid back feel. Thoroughly enjoyed the meal!To top it off, one can always go for a post-meal stroll in the serene Bishan Park and walk off the food coma!
4
The restaurant in located right in the middle of the Bishan Park and it is a good place to grab a burger (including a Wagyu beef burger) and a pint of beer (some choice here and is you like Weiss beer then you will be happy). What is great is the location within the park in that you can watch your kids play whilst you eat
5
The food is great, the service is so so. When we ordered some water, they forgot to bring. And we couldn't stay there since the lunch time is limited. It could be nice that people still can stay in and have coffee.
1
I had the har cheong gai burger. It was quite disappointing. There was only 2 pieces of thin vegetables, the fried oily chicken patty and dried burger buns. More vegetables and sauce can be added to make the burger more palatable (for that price).
4
nice scenic place for good quality breakfast. book first esp for weekends. Try the fries and sausages! ask for an outdoor seat to take in the full scenery.
4
Dropped by on a Sunday for dinner. Ordered a set meal for 2 to share and the food was great! They didn't have churros but they replaced it with a cake. The service is excellent. Would definitely come back again and recommend to others.
4
Went there for Saturday lunch and enjoyed myself. The food was good and the environment was nice. My suggestion is to buy their pre-paid vouchers for additional discounts.
3
Ordered double beef patties cheeseburger and the beef patties were too salty and unevenly cooked - raw in the middle and cooked around the sides. Har cheong hao burger was a lil tad salty too. Salted egg yolk wings can be improved too (maybe fry the wings instead of bake?) Service is good thou! Wanted to order mentaiko fries but waiter recommended us to get the sauce at 2$ instead since we will have fries as our burgers' sides. Saved some money there!
4
I went to GRUB with my friend for lunch and we ordered the Sakura Ebi Pasta, Chilli Crab pasta and the Mentaiko Fries. The Mentaiko Fries were heavenly. It's really a "must-order" item. I felt that the Chilli Crab pasta was relatively oily and unpleasant towards the end but overall it's unique. I would return to try more of GRUB's food

Perfect location nestled in Bishan Park and we landed on a drizzly Sunday evening. The awning was out and it just felt like the perfect outdoor dinner. Service was efficient and the grub was tasty. We ordered Cheese burger (beef was perfect), mentaiko fries ( no fault of the restaurant, just overwhelming after a few dips), crispy fish burger ( very very nicely done, no frozen, over cooked fish that is common in other restaurants) and chicken mushroom quesadillas and churros to wrap up a vest family meal! Will come back for sur

Went for Brunch with my sister on Sunday morning. Making reservations earlier do make sure there are seats. Maybe it was busy on Sundays, had to get attention of the wait staff for initial orders and paying bill. Me and my sister ordered Breakfasts, one of us plate and the other Stack. Overall quite a pleasant experience, but would be better if my food were hot or at least warm. The food was all served up within 10-15 mins of us ordering which was pretty fast

The location of this restaurant is really nice, right in the middle of a park. So it will lift your mood by going there and enjoy the scenery. But the highlight is of course the burger itself. I ordered the double cheeseburger and it was really nice. An unforgettable taste, with a very large serving of beef patties. Price likewise it is very reasonable, it cost you less than $20 for a nice set of burger. Definitely worth the visit, in fact I am currently planning for my second visit to this place
3
The wild mushrooms tasted muddy.. (Classic Breakfast set) and the french toast was average - could taste more of the bread than the egg.
4
We had a ha jiong gai burger and chilli crab pasta. It was interesting. The park environment surrounding is nice.
4
2nd visit to Grub. Good great value for money and reasonably tasty food. Really liked the Har Cheong Gai burger.
4
Nice place in the park. Service was good and quite quick, considering it was busy. Food was ok - not great but straightforward. Worth going to chill in the park.
4
Went there for drinks and cakes. We also ordered the fried chicken wings, love the taste of it. We also ordered the key lime tarts and passion tofu cheesecake. Taste really good.
3
I must admit that the restaurant offers a great view to Angmokio and Bishan park . The smoked salmon sallad i ordered was the worst i ever tried but the Grub cheeseburger was good and delicious. Service was good especially Gaojing very helpful.
5
Grub is basically my neighbourhood restaurant in the park. My tweenagers love the place and the adults love the quality food that they serve. It's great for a lazy weekend brunch!
5
Great find, great food, we love this place and are regular visitors. A really good combination of dining within a picturesque setting.
4
the food was served rather quickly which was good for us who are working folks heading out for lunch, but due to the high traffic, the staff took a bit of time to get the things we need such as spoons and water. But overall it was a good experience
4
Found Grub online when looking for somewhere outside to eat. Fresh outdoor surroundings in bishan park with some tables outdoors Brunch is served at lunchtime on Sunday and there was a good choice. My partner had the three cheese pasta and I had the bacon eggs and sausages. Well prepared and tasty. Good value and we will come back.
5
First time visiting Grub at Bishan Park. Lovely place in bishan park. Relaxing and comfortable place to chill with family and friends. Definitely worth 2nd visit. Food for brunch is limited however taste is good not too bland or salty.
4
OverAll everything was good. Jus that there is insufficient manpower to attend to you. Food portion was kinda small.
5
Was glad to get a seat quickly. The food was delicious. An overall good experience. Would think of going back again.
4
Nestled within Bishan Park, their location is perfect for casual dinner followed with a nice walk in the park. Coupled with excellent grills, burgers and salads, it's a thumbs up from us.
3
Service was ok. Food was recent but the portion can be increased! Went back 2nd time! Recommend this place!

For appetisers, we ordered the mentaiko fries fried chicken wings. Both were really good. The salted egg yolk sauce that came with the wings was well-seasoned. For mains, we ordered the double cheeseburger which was very tender and perfectly cooked to medium rare (like we had ordered it to be) and the Grub breakfast set which had grilled focaccia, scrambled eggs, mushrooms and garlic thyme pork sausage. The eggs were a bit dry but that may be because I had ordered them to be well done and not runny. Both the eggs and mushrooms were not seasoned very well and were quite tasteless. The ambience was good but outdoor seats may have been better as the ones indoors were quite cramped.

I'm a Scout. I go to the HQ in Bishan. I thrive in the outfields and I don't have much of a palette. As such, I am impressed easily. Having seen raving reviews of Grub online, I thought to give it a try. Free parking nearby is brilliant. Scenery in the park: superb. Staff and service: excellent. Coffee: aromatic. Free water: a definite plusWagyu burger with fries ($21++): nothing specialBrunch set with chicken sausage: clinical delivery with no winning formulaUnless you absolutely need green scenery around you (we scouts do), go elsewhere and save your dough
4
Located within Bishan Park and it offers great scenery for a break of urban Singapore. Ample parking available just across the bridge and one can take a walk around the park. Grub offer great service, wipe and brings baby chair to us and cover the food while we change our baby diaper. Food is tasty and price is reasonable.
4
The place and service was great. Great environment to chit chat and slowly enjoy your burger/pasta. However the fact that i gave it 4 star was because there is no shelter all the way to the restaurant and that day it was about to rain so i had to finish my food before i get caught in the rain. Recommended for people who driv

Made a reservation and arrived on time but was surprised to learn that I had to sit at the counter. Got shifted to another table for 2 pax but right at the doorway and my friend was constantly being disturbed by the frequent door opening. The restaurant seems understaffed as it took me a while to catch the attention of the service staff to place my order
4
o Lovely food.
o Inexpensive.
o Easy to access from the park.
o Tasty burger!
- Their signature Lychee drink is a must try!
x Easy to access unless you're close by.
4
Great environment as it is in the Park. best time to go during weekday, no crowd no queue. Love the steak! must try.
4
Overall a pleasant experience but it doesn't seem to be able to cater for groups more than 6 people as the tables were seperated.
5
The restaurant offers western food, drink and dessert. Its located in the middle of the Bishan Park with perfect greenery.
4
Pleasant, green surroundings, friendly & helpful staff who took the initiative to serve water while I waited for my friends to arrive. Will come back again. :)
4
Great food and atmosphere. Its my second time here and I like the burgers and tea. Only thing I dislike is the mosquito bites.

Dined here with my family over the weekend when it was pouring cats and dogs. The location of this cafe is tad distant from the car park but you overlook that fact if you're little health conscious. The cafe offer both outdoor and indoor seatibg. The menu is pretty small with a decent selection of starters and mains. The mains consist of few burgers and pastas only.We ordered soup of the day, which was minestrone, cheese and mushroom quesadilla, Portobello mushroom burger, churros and cappuccino. The minestrone soup which came with two thin slices focaicca bread, was fine. The quesadilla was literally filled with mushroom and cheese and came with salad by the side. Seriously, who eats quesadilla with salad? A simple cheese sauce or sour cream will be more apt. The Portobello mushroom burger was pretty small and basic with lettuce, tomatoes, fetta cheese (which I replaced with Monterey Jack) and no mayo or sauce to go along with the patty.You can add caramelized onion, Monterey Jack cheese for a surcharge of $2 each. It came along with a decent serving of fries. The burger is not worth the bucks as for $15, you can get much bigger, tastier and stacked up burger at any burger specialty restaurants in Singapore. The churros was served super hot but not well dusted with cinnamon and sugar. It churros was crunchy on the outside and little soggy in the inside. The churros came along with chocolate and cream dip which were pretty average. Overall, it just an average cafe selling average food at prices which don't justify the quality of the food served. It's only for casual eaters. Foodies will be disappointed for sure
1
Cute place. That's where it ends! Ordered portobello burger. What a RIP OFF for small bun + 1 small slice portobello + 2 thin slices tomatoes + small lettuce all for $11 + gst! There are much better tasting n organic portobello burgers that I'd rather pay more elsewhere. Won't be back ever!
3
I came here for some coffee fix and just some light bites. Their food menu looks interesting but I didn't go for the food. We ordered our coffee and some churros to go with them. Coffee was decent but the churros weren't that fantastic. Either way, it's a good place to get your coffee fix if you're nearby. Nice atmosphere as it's situated inside the park
3
I visited Grub on a Friday evening with a few friends for dinner. They were running one for one promo for beer on weekday.We tried their interesting fusion food in the menu - chill crab spaghetti and har jeong kai burger, also a popular dish,fish burger.Chill crab spaghetti is pretty normal according to my friend. It is a fried soft shell crab drench with some spaghetti sauce.Har jeong kai burger taste like zi char har jeong kai ,pretty nice.Fish burger comes with a big chunky piece of fish fillet, which is very much value for money. Overall its a great place to chill but do be careful of the mosquito bites as the night falls
5
Clean, fast and very good service, very attentive and have sense of urgency
ambience is nice as weather was cooling
5
Tasty burgers and great service in a beautiful location. Price was also reasonable in my opinion. Overall good value
4
The mains were fantastic but a drawback was the dessert I guess. We ordered churros but I guess we never will again cos we aren't churro fans. But if you are one you should try it :D
5
Thanks Grub! We had a relaxed afternoon catching up w old friends over freshly prepared burgers n pasta...
4
Were pretty impressed with the food & drinks' quality despite the limited menu selection. On the other hand, more training required for new server.
3
GRUB offers fuss free breakfast and pub grub within the less populated but equally charming Bishan Park I - "smaller sister" in park space to the popular, award winning Bishan Park II. Recommend the diner for weekday tête-à-têtes or intimate catch up amongst friends.
5
Perfect experience! The restaurant even messaged me to confirm the timing :) I was 15 minutes late but still the seat was reserved for me. Food was also served fast, and price is reasonable. Will go back again!
4
The food has been consistently good. The fish burger was a little hard this time. Service was average. Wait staff could have been more attentive.
3
Very patient despite me late for my reservation. Thanks for waiting for us. Food range is quite limited to just mostly burgers, would like to have more variety to choose from. Otherwise, food is ok. Thank you.
4
We always love the food. Wholesome, hearty, tastes just like homemade food. Service was strangely slow on a Sunday morning which I consider to be one of their slower-moving ones given that the haze came back and there was not the usual crowd at the restaurant. Yet our drinks took reminders before they arrived, after the food was long served. In fact, the food (two breakfast sets and one beef burger) was dished out to us within five minutes of us placing our orders, that it made us wonder if the food had been prepared and plated earlier and had been 'sitting around' just waiting to be brought out. That the food wasn't hot reinforced this thought. But otherwise, the service was warm and even when one of my kids spilled water on the table and floor, two of their staff sprang to action promptly and was very friendly, kind and helpful, even checking on my kid to ensure that he was ok. So kudos to that spirit
4
Good food and great service. Water refilling was prompt, we don't even need to approach staff to refill our cups. I hope for the menu to expand with more food and dessert selection though. Overall, it was a great experience as my third visit here!
4
a very nice and cosy place for brunch, escape from city. go early if you can so u feel the place is to your self hehe
1
Food was mediocre. Overpriced american food. Service was poor especially by the Indian waiter who was very rude and showed so much attitude. Avoid this place at all costs!
4
Love the ambience. Service is excellent. Staff are attentive. Food just above average. Could improve flavor and presentation.
4
Food and ambience was good. Food came fast too. A little shorthanded for service crew. Difficult to get service crew attention.
5
The burgers are excellent and the seaweed fries are a nice touch. Great indie music. Good place for a first date!
Staff is friendly and offered good suggestions that catered to our palates.
4
A casual, cosy atmosphere coupled with delicious food. Service was fast and the staff friendly. I would love to visit again.
5
Their service are good and the food are delicious. Went there as a date. The location are suitable for all type of visit.
3
We tried the steak and ebi pasta. Both items were decent, my girlfriend loved the steak and its mustard sauce while I liked how the ebi pasta pasted, not too creamy. But we both admit that the prawn (he-bi) taste on the ebi pasta was a little overpowering and covered the mentaiko taste. We also ordered a side of salted egg chicken wings. The salted egg taste could only be tasted on the skin but not the meat, definitely the best I've tried for salted egg chicken wings. Price came up to about $52, saved $10 with chope vouchers. Doubt we would go back again though since there was nothing memorable other than the warm service of their staff

We visited Grub for lunch on a weekday and it was easy to get a table. The restaurant was a little out of the way, especially if you do not drive or take a cab. Menu is centered on American foods. Burgers, pasta. Go check out their website first to see current menu and decide if that's what you like to eat; otherwise, to move elsewhere would be extremely inconvenient. I had the Pork Steak Burger. The pork was nice and soft. However it wasn't as flavorful as I had expected considering that it was tagged with a grilled pineapple. Total price of the burger including all taxes was $16, which is a little high for a simple burger with fries. I've been told that Grub is crowded at peak hour times and weekends, so it's not quite a place you can stay too long to chil
4
Ambience was great, food was great but service is very slow. Workers were helpful and nice. The food was worth the money! :)
5
Good food, service & ambience.. Value for money too..just be sure to park at the right car park or be prep to walk
3
While the place and service is okay the burger could have been so much better. For 11 bucks its a small burger which is not enough to make a meal.
The taste is also very okay, burger not juicy enough and lack condiments and sauces.
4
Went there for lunch on a weekday, as we heard that the place is usually packed on the weekends. Had the chicken prawn paste burger, grill chicken burger, bolognese pasta and chicken wings. The food and service was up to the mark and were pleasantly surprised by the chicken prawn paste burger and salted egg york on the fried chicken wings. Must warn that indoor seating capacity is relatively small at about 40 seats, although there is outdoor seating available

I have read so many articles listing Grub as one of the best place for Burgers. When I have tried it, It didnt disappoint me. In fact, it was really a great experience in general.Choices are not much but they got variety. You want beef patty, pork, fish, or vegetarian option, they've got it! After trying out their burgers one at a time per visit, I'd say my favorite is their classic Cheese Burger. No fuss, just plain cooking perfection! Beef patty is not dry but moist and not overcooked. You could actually see it's inside a tinge of pink in the center when you cut it in half, or took a bite from it. And you could definitely say from the looks and taste of it that it is fresh. You can add on some other additional items for an extra cost of course. You got an option to get a Double Cheese Burger which has double patty which I have not tried yet but surely would be a hit for those who got big appetite. They got great fries too to acompany your burger. I don't know how they do it like no other. The outside is crispy in a way that doesn't get soggy in time, but still kept it's soft inside. I would recommend churros for dessert as I dont think many places in Singapore serve churros. It is not bad though, and it is almost a novelty to me whenever I find churros in the menu as it is not so common.The service is very good. Accomodating and smiling staff who are always on their heels to cater for your requests. They serve tap water, cold or warm, and for free! The prices are decent and personally think that it is not overpriced.The place is set in the midst of Bishan-Ang Mo Kio Park, so you are surrounded with greens, Kallang River and a pond. A short bus ride from Bishan or Ang Mo Kio MRT (alight at Sin Ming Ave. or Ang Mo Kio Ave. 1). They got indoor and outdoor seating. Indoor seating would be nice in hot and humid times as they got really powerful aircon. It would be a bit uncomfortable though on cold days as it can really get cold. Outside seating is not bad but very nice on cool and windy days. On most times during dinner time, we are on waiting list because of so many people (old and young, families, couples) frequenting the place.We would be asked to enter our phone number on a tablet instead of queueing there outside just standing and waiting, and they would call if tables are ready. We would have time to walk around the area, or seat on nearby park benches.They would also ask if you are okay to share a table with some other which could be a great opportunity of making new friends! Truly a great experience dining here

Service at the restaurant was okay. The servers directed us to our seat promptly, and was quick to take our orders. However, it is pretty difficult getting the servers attention when we wanted a refill of water, or when we wanted to place additional orders for dessert. It might be due to the sudden influx of customers, however, we waited close to 10 minutes before anyone paid attention to us, and I think service can be improved in this aspect.The restaurant is located in the middle of a park, so the atmosphere is real good, and since we're placed indoors, we get to enjoy the scenery in an air-conditioned setting which makes it better. I got the Fish Burger and Churros, and I find both a bit too dry, so they can definitely improve on their food standard.Overall, it was a pretty interesting experience
5
Service was great. The staff were friendly and helpful. Val was very patient when I had some problems with my Chope voucher. He helped to contact the offce and managed to solve the problem. The food was great and this is my second visit. The other staff were also friendly and patient when taking our orders and explaining the different dishes. The cakes were superb! A must when you visit this restaurant
4
Staff were very friendly and helpful. One of the male staff offered to help us take a family photo before we went into the restaurant (he did not know we had a reservation made). Food were nice except the Pork Steak Burger which I find it to be tasteless and abit tough. Fries were very crispy on the outside, soft on the inside! We love it!
4
We've been to Grub once before but this time my wife won a free har cheong gai burger through a facebook competition.The above-mentioned burger's meat was tantalising and juicy and we both enjoyed it thoroughly.In addition to that, we had a GRUB double cheeseburger which was so-so. We also had the churros which was standard but the chocolate dip was a little diluted. We were thinking of taking away a chocolate salted caramel tart but were too full for that. We like that the cakes are homemade, probably in house as they have an oven behind the counter.The place is a little noisy because of no sound insulation whatsoever. Nonetheless, it's a cool chill place to be in the middle of the park
3
9 members split into 2 tables. Hence large extended families not able to sit ibto 1 long table. Facing water front area and quieter. Grub double cheeseburger was juicy and nice. Except the fries was a tad salty to my liking.Slow cooked pork belly was tender and soft yet was too much fat on it.Chicken steak - Do Not order it. Tough meat and not pleasant.Prawn and mango salad for appettizer - fresh, crunchy and sweet. Mentaiko fries was a let down. Seaweed was good but fries were salty. All agreed on this.Dessert was a let down and not worth mentioning.Okay for brunch or tea or coffee breaks not for dinner
2
Went for a brunch at grub and was really disappointed. Food standard has dropped. That said, it's a nice place in a nice park. Worth a visit. Serves great churros!
4
It was a 10-minute walk to GRUB for us in the tranquility of the park. 1 hour before arriving, I received an automated call asking for a confirmation and I had entered '1' to confirm. My partner and I arrived and we saw a couple just literally a step ahead of us who went in first. I told the staff at the door that we would like to have an indoor seat, but he said it was full. I told him that I had made a reservation using Chope and showed him the email but he said no, seating was on a first-come-first serve basis. We found it strange and were clearly annoyed. I thought maybe I should have given him the definition of 'reservation'. Well, what's the point in making a reservation then. Chope really needs to have a good talk with GRUB on that. And so he suggested the counter seat and we reluctantly agreed. Somehow, we suggested to move to the table that was previously occupied by the said couple and we got that. Good view of the park.Food arrived relatively fast and the wait staff were polite. She ordered the har cheong gai (prawn paste deep fried chicken) burger ($13) and I ordered the chilli crab pasta (linguine) ($18). The food was quite delicious but the har cheong gai burger was a tad too salty. The serving is pretty big for the burger and average for the chilli crab pasta. She ordered peppermint tea ($5) and I just had water. Overall, a good experience. 3 items for $42.30, with 10% service charge and 7% GST. My only gripe was the 'reservation made BUT it's on a first-come-first-serve basis'
3
I'm not sure how I feel about Grub yet. Perhaps another visit will make my mind clearer. The good points would be the garden ambience, the attentive staff, how easy it is to get there by bus, and the fact that they don't push / rush you out of the place just because there's a queue. Just make sure you have a reservation otherwise you'll have to wait. So the experience in these aspects was definitely good. But being a resto, I was hoping that the primary reason to love it would be the food. My friend ordered a cheeseburger which she sang praises about. I ordered the portobello mushroom burger which left me hungry & craving for a more flavorful / filling meal. I really liked the fries though. As for the churros, I've tasted much better ones where they are lighter, crisper and the chocolate sauce much more sinful than the one in Grub. Guess the best part was using the Chope voucher which let us order $50 worth of food & drinks (excluding tax & service charge) for the price of $40. So yeah, there are definitely more good points than not-so-good ones. But being disappointed with the food when it's a resto is a bit unsettling. So I have mixed feelings about the place. I'll still visit it and maybe order a different dish next time.
4
I was greeted by attentive, enthusiastic staff at the entrance - which is usually a good sign for service.Overall, impressed with two staff in particular: this guy (I reckon is the manager of the wait staff) who sat me promptly and explained the beers available for their one-for-one Happy Hour. The other a young, friendly waitress with an interesting earring, who was pretty attentive, even after the restaurant got crowded later that night.My friend and I shared the prawn and mango salad and had their burger and chilli crab pasta for mains. We enjoyed the meal.I would return again as I like the laid back, casual atmosphere and the nice green views didn't hurt either.  
1
What's the point of reservations when you can even have a preference to seat indoors!!! To get a seat indoors DESPITE making reservations, we had to join the normal Q system. Because of that, we had to wait for more than an hour plus with 2 young kids! Of cos, I definitely won't be desperate enough to come here anymore and some others might think it's fine. DUMB Q SYSTEM
4
Chicken steak with sweet potato mash is just delicious and weird at the same time, because the purple mash just looks extra ordinary. Totally out of the norm but taste alight.Then the ebi sakura pasta is too expensive for a few prawns with linguine.. Taste is alrighty but not superb.I guess its a bit pricy for a restaurant ranging 17-18 per dish which have small serving. Service is alright thoug
4
The reason I have been to Grub more than once is obvious. I enjoyed my food experiences at this place.This visit, I made a reservation online. Upon receiving an email confirmation, it was stated in the email that I could buy vouchers at 10% off. So I bought a $100 voucher for $90. The booking system and buying of vouchers was swift and easy!We had Mentaiko fries, mango & prawn salad, pork steak burger, fish burger, xo cream seafood pasta and soft shell crab chilli pasta, for desserts we shared churros. Feedback: churros was a disappointment this time round, found the pastry too thick and the chocolate sauce was so watery. I remembered it to be much better last time. Soft shell crab chilli pasta was more of a tomato paste as I did not taste chilli at all. Overall, still a good experience and I will still be back. I hope Grub continues to have the 10% off voucher!
5
Love the burgers, Fries and Pasta. The beef patties are tasty and moist. The Mentaiko fries does not feel greasy. The sakura Ebi is another dish worth trying.The family had a great meal and will certainly go back again. The staff are friendly and polite but poor souls I think they are understaffed for the weekend
4
Make a reservation for weekend brunch with husband. And we bring our 5 months old baby to the restaurant. Staffs are friendly and helpful. Foods are great. Love the french toast serve with pork sausage and strawberry. Grilled chicken burger is juicy. Yuzu soda quite refreshing. THe hot chocolate which I order is not think enough. It could be improve more. There are variety of desserts on the cake display and we order sour cream cheesecake, cheesecake is rich of cheese. Good for sharing. Value for money

Had a really enjoyable lunch at Grub at Bishan Park yesterday. Loved the ambience and the food! Service could be better though... no one came to refill my water the whole time.. and when we ordered dessert and coffee, the coffee was served but there was no sight of the churros for a long time.. Finally when we asked what's happening, someone went to check and told us that the deep fryer was actually out of order. They should have come to informed us instead of waiting for us to almost finish our coffee and having to ask! Other than that, I had a good time catching up with friends (wiht baby in tow) there! Child friendly too :)  
4
My wife and I bring our 5 years daughter and newborn baby to this restaurant, the food is nice and the stuff are helpful. They even check with us, if the aircon is too cold for our newborn baby.
4
Went there for lunch.
The fries are good.
The churros are fine.
Didn't try the burgers as I was not that hungry.
Ambience is nice in the Ang mo kio park.
4
Overall is a good experience. Fast service and food is good at this price. Is a good place to have a nice conversation with friends or couples.
5
Staff are very friendly and nice. Good food at reasonable price. I would recommend this place to my friends. Will come back again to try their other menu.

Decided to try this place as it seems to have a long queue and looks pretty crowded on weekends whenever I pass by it on my way home. Reviews online of this place looks pretty much on the positive side. Came here for dinner on a Saturday night (around 8ish pm). There wasn't much queue and waiting time was relatively short. It seems that it might rain despite the heavy rain in the early afternoon. Hence, opted for an inside seat thinking that it would be cooler / less humid. Was seated next to the cakes' display case and the whole place felt so warm. And to make matters worse, there were lots of insects . Spent half the time trying to read the menu and swatting the insects (the kind that appears when its going to rain soon) off me, the table and menu. Ordered the quesadilla, fish burger and chilli crab pasta. Quesadilla was very average, the highly raved fish burger was awful and the chilli crab pasta was too salty. The fish fillet was so dry + fishy and I felt that MacDonalds' fish burger would have easily surpassed it. Highly disappointed with the food that we didn't bother finishing the food. Even decided to skip their dessert (their churros looked so tempting thou but we decided we had enough disappointments!). All of us agreed that this place served nice looking, instagram-worthy looking photos but rated terribly on taste. During our meal, there were still many insects and I was getting quite annoyed that the staff wasn't doing anything about it despite seeing us swatting the insects off our food and table. We felt that this place was not worth the money and calories. Overall, would not recommend this place at all and would never go back
5
The location is hard to find, but once you do find it, you will see the charm and why so many people queue up on the weekends. The service was ok, but the food well worth the wait with a finger-licking good burger. The presentation was outstanding! The meat and bun and juices are superb from the first bite to the last, amazing burger!! The fries were perfect and the atmosphere, light music, light fan breeze, happy people made this a very memorable Sunday lunch!!! PS try the Number 9 beer from the States, a great compliment to the day

Heard a lot about GRUB and the queue was very long. We had to make reservations in advance to get a table. The service and the ambience was great - the view was lovely. The food, however, was a total let-down. The truffle bacon baked eggs had hardly any bacon or truffle taste. It looked and tasted like 2 regular soft-boiled eggs to dip the breadstick in. The fish burger was raved about by everyone but the fried fish was dry, hard and not fresh. The fishy taste was overwhelming. The pork steak burger was alright - the steak was tough at certain parts. Thank goodness for the slice of pineapple that made it better. The desserts were obviously from FIX so no comments on that. Overall, it was a disappointing experience. I had expected much better food considering the queue, hype and prices. 
4
Me and my wife was looking for a dinner date near by, on a weekday. Staff was very welcoming and make sure everybody gets enough attention. Like the freshly cooked food, even though prices go some what similar to down town. Nicely located in the middle of AMK park which makes you take a walk after dinner around the ponds
3
Overall it was a pleasant experience however ratings for the food and service are average but could be better if they put in more effort and take customers' feedback here seriously.I ordered a Double cheeseburger, with mentaiko fries and sausage/scrambled egg Breakfast set wit coffee. The cheeseburger was lukewarm and the beef was a little overcooked. The sausage was really BLAND, very mildly salted (tasted like it was boiled, perhaps). The long black coffee was average but was priced a $5 (excl.gst and svc charge) which I find that it is too steep for such quality kopi-o. Mentaiko fries was good though. So bottom line is the cooks are not very passionate about cooking. So should really buck up. I recently been to a small cafe (didn't have high expectations) at Craig Road called Selfish Genes. The food was really good and was truly impressed by the cook's effort. So, wd I go back to Grubs? I guess it's a 50/50 thing. I like the location but definitely won't miss the food if there are better places to eat

Went for dinner on a Sat. Had to make reservations online as restaurant do not take reservations through phone. Went there at 6.30pm and the place was already crowded and people with no reservations had to wait at the side. Reservation is a MUST or you will end up waiting >1 hr during peak hours. Pleasant surroundings since it's located in Bishan Park II and it was windy that day so very pleasant to sit outdoors. Ordered 1) mentaiko fries $9, 2) chilli crab baked eggs $10, 3) pork quesadilla $8, 4) grilled chicken burger $12, 5) mushroom pasta 2 portions $15 and 5) iced honey lime juice $3. Item 1 was the best, the mentaiko dip was excellent. Item 2 was not worth the price, chilli crab was too mild, no kick at all. Item 3 was yummy, pork was well marinated. Item 4 was juicy and item 5 was nice (but there are definitely better ones out there). Total bill was $80+ for 4 pax. Overall dining experience was good but only the mentaiko fries would make my family go back for a 2nd visit

Love the ambience and the food presentation. The staff was not too attentive, waited a while to be seated and ice water was not served/top up till several request.

Recently went to Grub for lunch. The food was reasonably priced and the presentation was good. The cafe took the reservation seriously and confirmed multiple times that I will be there. The surrounding and ambience of the cafe are good. Overall a nice dining experience.

The environment looks very nice, can eat outdoor with the garden view. but the food just so so so.Not very delicious but looks nice!

Booked a table for 2 on a Saturday evening for dinner here, & was cautioned that only outdoor seating would be available for such bookings by a staff on the phone. Fortunately we were allocated indoor seats when we arrived, although it wasn't really cool indoors given the really warm weather that day.Nonetheless, we enjoyed the ambience of having a relaxed meal in a cafe at Bishan Park. The Crispy Fish Burger and Mentaiko Fries were very tasty. The fish was really crispy and came in a generous portion. We like the chunky fries served. One minus point was the bread used for the burger was nothing to shout about. We also had the Yuzu Mint Soda which was very refreshing.Would love to return to Grub to try out its other food next time

Compare to fancy places, pricing is reasonable. The food is not bad, particularly the GRUB breakfast set is worthy. However nothing special but the envoirnment is nice where is in the AMK Bishan Park. If you just stay there, it's a good choice to drop by for a brunch and a cozy Sunday morning

Just got back from lunch and it was so good that I had to tell everyone I know about it. Service was excellent. The Filippino waiter was friendly and efficient. The surrounding was bright, clean and airy....much better than Canopy over at the other end. Food was fresh, tasty and well presented.We had the chorizo salad to start. The chorizo bits, instead of the usual bacon, really jazzed up the caesar salad. I had the soft shell chilli crab linguine and it was excellent. The crispy soft shell crab that adorned the pasta was not at all greasy. The generous amount of crabmeat in the sauce was evident in every mouthful. My husband had their special of the month, which was duck confit and he remarked that it was equally pleasing to the palate. The not-too-sweet yuzu mint soda was a real thirst quencher. Snooped around the other tables and almost everyone there had some sort of burger....might try that on our next visit. A concise menu but very well executed! Portions were adequate.....unless you're a summo who is used to upsizing your meal constantly. Glad we picked this place for our 14th anniversary lunch

It was an overall pleasant experience for an early dinner at grub on saturday. To start off, the restaurant seem pretty busy on a saturday evening. Personally, I felt that the food was worth the price. I loved my fish burger and the fries with seaweed that I've ordered. the ambience isn't fantastic for a romantic date as I felt that customers were seated too close to one another and I realised it was hard communicating to my partner indoors as the chatter from other group of people and baby screams distrupted our conversation. However, I am very happy with the service as the waitress who took my order had the initiative to ask me if I wanted to change my side of fries to salad because I had an order of fries. It was very thoughtful of her. overall, it's a good chill cafe to be at when you want to have some decent food with a nice view of the park. Perhaps ill try outdoor seating when I go again the next time (

Having made a reservation, we got in without a glitch. It was our second visit in 2 weeks as Hubby had a craving for their quesadilla.We ordered the pork quesadilla as an appetiser, the pork steak burger and the chicken steak for our main courses and the sticky chocolate cake as our appetiser.The pork steak burger was lovely. The sous vide pork was tender and flavourful, going very well with the pineapple. The juices of the pork exploded in the mouth and created a wonderful symphony with the pineapple and flavourful sauce.The chicken steak was simple. While the serving was small, the sweet potato mash made up for it. As I am a great lover of sweet potato, I am partial to the combination of chicken, leeks and purple sweet potato. Found the steak appropriately seasoned.The chocolate cake came with a generous serving of vanilla ice-cream and homemade strawberry sauce. the sauce complemented the cake well, though I would still prefer the Churros.All in all, it was a pleasurable experience for us!Thank you Grub for the food and great service

Grub is situated in the middle of Bishan Ang Mo Kio (that name though) park, and first impressions were already pretty good. The environment is clean and service staff is really friendly and helpful. My friends and I visited at dinnertime. Most of us had a GRUB cheeseburger which I would rate slightly above average. My friends' grilled steak and fries though, was superb. The portions feel slightly small, but is very filling. Overall my friends and I were able to hang out in a very warm and cozy and thankfully bright environment, and even go for a walk around the park after, so the experience was pretty good

Went there for a weekday lunch - ordered a Crispy Fish Burger for myself, and a Mushroom Pasta for my partner. Topped off the mains with a Iced Honey Lime Juice and a Long Black, with two glasses of iced water as well.The service was jiffy since the place was < 50% packed. Servers were attentive and refilled our iced water without prompting.The food came, and the crispy fish burger ($14) was simply a piece of fried fish (from the kind you get when you order a fish and chip) stacked between two burger bread pieces. The fish came crispy like the name, though with a dark orange/brown tinge on the fried batter indicating it was over-fried. The fish tasted very dry; almost like the kind that you would get at any hawker center's western food stall (For a much lower price!). The french fries however was very crispy and crunchy.The mushroom pasta ($15) was too salty (could smell the saltiness immediately when the dish was served), and too oily as well. The pasta was so oily that my partner felt the sickening feeling of greasiness when she was done. Other than that, there was some kind of leafy vegetable in the pasta that gave it an overpowering "veggie" taste that ruined the whole mushroom pasta.The Iced Honey Lime juice ($3) tasted pretty refreshing and cool. Nothing special there.I had the Long Black ($3.50) after the food was finished - it was slightly sourish/acidic, and the long black had a slight reddish tinge to it, probably due to the machine being calcified, or the beans being exposed for too long before being grounded to make the long black.Despite the lack of patrons during the weekday lunch service, the ambiance was poor - I could hardly hear my partner speak during the course of the lunch as the music they were playing in the restaurant was simply too loud.They do serve some pretty rare beer (e.g., Crabbies Ginger Beer 500ml @ $12/bottle), though I did not try that as it was overpriced.The place is located at quite an inaccessible part of Bishan Park, so do remember to bring an umbrella in case of inclement weather, as there is absolutely no shelter to the nearest bus stop from the main road (5 mins walk)

Avoid at all costs! Dirty restaurant, Nice location but that's where it stops. Food is below average and customer service non-existent.
4
There were new servers. So maybe they are not very used to serving. Such as clearing tables halfway.
3
Generally a pleasant place to have brunch (in a park). the french toast had too much maple syrup drizzle and made the bread soggy (separate dip will be good). Recommended to have the crispy fries!
4
Food is nice, good design of food.
Good environment, located in a amk park.
Very easy accessible by bus or driving.
Staffs are friendly too.

I visited grub with a friend who heard about it. We were reluctant to try their new lobster burger because of the price, but we thought "ah what the hell!". Turned out to be the best burger we've had. The burger was a little small and pricey being a lobster burger but it was enough for us and it was just made to perfection. I've not tried the other dishes on their menu but I'm told that their beef burger is also a worthy choice
5
It was awesome.. the queue was fast even though I was late.. they managed to find a table inside the diner for us. As for the food, though the portion may be small but the quality of the dishes were there. Really did enjoyed myself and wouldn't hesitate to pay GRUB another visit

Me and girlfriend went there for lunch recently. Our main order took such a long time to be served and when the food was finally served, there were no cutleries ! We ordered pasta and burger ....so I'm sure they didn't expect us to eat pasta with our fingers !!? We had to ask for cutleries to be served and it was such a challenge to get the waiters' attention throughout the time we were there. We also ordered the desert from the beginning (around 1pm) to be served after our main course. At 2.30pm, the waiters were going round to inform diners that the kitchen is closing for any last orders. We reminded them that we were still waiting for our desert since 2pm. Then we realised that all other diners were also waiting for desert to be served. Meantime, the waiters were busy going round getting every table to settle the bill and reminding customers that the cafe will close at 3pm. Then 10 minutes to closing, the waiters brought out deserts...the churros were piping hot so we started nibbling it slowly...final straw was when a waiter came to our table and asked us whether we mind seating outside, sharing a bench with some other diners cos they need to close....this was when we were half-way eating the desert and sipping our latte !! Awfully rude and terrible service ! You don't kick your diners out while they are still eating and especially when they had waited so long for you to serve their order ! Please never ever bother to go to this cafe. Overpriced, overhyped and terrible service

As we loved to visit cafe and heard of this place so as a family we went for our weekend breakfast.For us, we loved to order the food to share. We loved their Churros, a must try dishes. It came with two sauces. We also loved the surrounding as it was just in the Bishan Park. If you are sitting outdoor you will be able to enjoy the surrounding. Good place to relax and having your breakfast

service: crew showed great enthusiasm. many cafes hire young servers, but seldom are they as cheerful as these guys and girls at grub.food: the mentaiko fries were great! we definitely preferred this japanese-inspired version to the now-popular truffle tries. they were really generous with the mentaiko aioli. not only was their a good drizzle over the fries before topping with seaweed, there was also a small side dish of the aioli served with the freshly fried fries. this would prolly be our only reason to return.read some good reviews about the truffle egg cocotte, but both my bf and i didn't see the hype about it. maybe because we're both not truffle fans to begin with. a review said that this dish is a reinvention of the local soft-boiled egg with kaya toast breakfast (this was served with foccasia toast soldiers) but we'll take the original version anytime, please.the churros were another "must-order" from reviews. we liked it on its own, hot, crisp and covered with cinnamon sugar. the creme anglaise and chocolate dips could have escalated our experience, but both were not viscous enough. the creme anglaise also didn't have much taste, even lending some unpleasant sourness to the churros. the chocolate dip felt too powdery and not intense enough.coffee: we ordered a latte and were satisfied, but it wasn't anything to wow about. best coffee experience is still at yahava.environment: situated within bishan-ang mo kio park, there is greenery all around which makes for a pleasant dining experience. we sat outdoors, and even so it was comfortable, not too hot like some alfresco experiences in singapore could be.note: for weekend brunch, last order is at 3.30. the place closes at 4 to prep for dinner

On a work trip from the States and visiting friends, so didn't eat out much on my first trip to Singapore. But a colleague and I had a dinner meeting one night at Grub. We sat outside. The place has a great atmosphere, beautiful setting, and extremely attentive staff. Our local friends advised the fish burger, and we weren't disappointed at all. The regular burgers, which our associates ordered, also looked good. And they had a great selection of beer. But easily the best part of the evening, other than the beautiful park setting, was the banter with our server. It was probably due to Singlish, but when we ordered the fish burgers it sounded like he was calling our manhood into question for not ordering beef. For the rest of the evening we joked back and forth with him. So often humor doesn't travel cross-culturally, but in this case it did and it made the dinner a lot of fun. I would definitely go back

I would have given it a Good if there was such an option.Impressive first impression when I walked up to the porch. The server was a friendly, makes you feel welcome with his smile and spontaneity. Using an ipad and online queuing service allowed myself, my wife and a friend to just stroll in the not-so-impressive park instead of loitering/waiting around the entrance. The servers were attentive. We ordered the grilled portobello which cost $11- pricy for 2 pieces. There was salsa by the plateside. Would have prefered it to be $8.90. But they tasted excellently. Not over grilled. Friend and I order medium well beef steak with salad/fries. The steak was $19/plate and it was delicious and it was at medium well. Sauce was fragrant too and goes well with the steak. BUT, the portion could be slightly larger. I was thinking $16 would be a better price. Wife went for her mushroom pasta. She enjoyed it despite commenting of the amount of oil they use. Didn't like the tap beer as well. Probably will return for the burger!!

Grub is a great place neighborhood chill out. It could get crowded during weekends. Do expect a while of waiting. Most would opt for the burger selection. The Churros are popular choices. Good for sharing. Service staff though young but were attentive and energetic. And were all helpful with requests. Worth a visit to this place.

Been wanting to come by for food for a while now but have been challenged by schedule!Finally, I was able to go for brunch at this place with my friend on 11th May. It was fortunate that we arrived when there was no queue as the weather was really humid. I am ok with hot but the rains that people hope for to chill things off only makes things worse after.Anyways let's not distract this review with weather talk.My friend and I wanted to try more food at Grub, so we decided to share everything. We ordered the GRUB breakfast set which includes two slices of grilled focaccia, scrambled eggs, mushroom and side salad. We chose the garlic thyme pork sausage and that was delicious! The entire set was pretty well made up and I loved everything about it (except the salad because I don't eat vegetables). The scrambled eggs was light and fluffy, the focaccia was nicely grilled but not too crispy that it might hurt your gums (I've had stuff like that so I am wary). We also topped up $2.50 to the set so I could order a pot of hot tea. My friend ordered an iced coffee which she commented was nice.We also ordered churros and I must say that I would much prefer the dark chocolate dip over the creme anglais. After we were done, we added on a waffle with chocolate ice cream. I don't quite fancy waffles with ice cream as much as waffles with butter and maple syrup but I still think that the waffles are worth coming over for. If they had pancakes that would be absolutely lovely!The only gripe I have is that whne my tea was served, there was a cup with saucer and a pot of tea. nothing else. My friend's iced coffee had sugar syrup. I didn't even have any sugar with my English Breakfast. When I asked for sugar, I was given one pack of raw sugar (I hate that stuff) for my pot of tea. That's one pack of SIS single serve sugar.I went up to one of the staff to aske for white sugar and she told me that they don't have it (I hate places that don't serve white sugar. Personal opinion.), but then when I said I'd take raw sugar anyway, she went and managed to find white sugar which she proceeded to give me... ONE pack.Seriously, what's with this one pack of sugar? Is there rationing going on? I had to ask for more sugar because I like to have tea with sugar. Ceylon tea MUST have sugar, for me. So in the end, I managed to get 3 packs of sugar (still way below my usual level but I'd settle).So... The food here is great, the setting is beautiful (it's in park!). The service is actually very good as the satff were quite attentive when we were there. I just need to bring my own sugar next time

Table reservation system is good. Waited 20mins after putting our name in the system. Food was ok. Pork belly was tasty, but they got my order wrong and gave me a cheeseburger instead of the chicken chilli cheese hotdog which i ordered. Told them it's fine as I did not want to wait another 30mins for the right order.After dinner, requested for our desserts to be served. 1 dessert came out within 10mins and the other 2 after another 30mins. No waters being refilled, or cutlery given with the dessert. Kinda ridiculous. Try to up your service even though you already have fairly good food
4
Nice cafe in the park, worth to stop by for brunch if you visit Bishan park. However, do prepared to wait for a while (we waited 30mins) as there is always queue. The chicken burger was yummy! Kid loves their fries, But portobello mushroom was just so-so, it's a bit plain too
4
Good ambient in Bishan Park. Good crowds...meaning on weekends must queue.We tried the Portobello Burger and the Cheese Burger with the Truffle Eggs as a side order...The food is good and the drink is normal. I might go back again, to try the rest of the menu....my friends said the pork belly burger is very good..
5
Wanted to try this for the longest time as it was just nearby my house, glad I did.They don't take reservations but you don't have to queue either, just pop in your name and contact in the tablet and you will join the virtual queue, and they will call you once your number is up, good for familes/people who are chilling around the park area. If you went in solo or twos it would perhaps be faster if counter seats were available.Service was outstanding, staff were polite. I had no qualms with the service unlike what others have said. They were apologetic when we were waiting for our food and also came to update us on the progress of food without being asked.They had interesting fruity beers from Scotland, Belgium which were pretty good. We had the Brewdog Dead Pony which was the most fruity beer I had ever tried, with a great after taste. Tried the fish burger which was as what many had said, their must try main course. Also tried the chicken thigh burger with lime mayo which we really enjoyed, good sauce. Fries were light and crispy. Ended the night with a belgium waffle with butter and maple syrup.. yums. Brings me right back to the days when A&W was around and they served their signature round waffles with butter and maple. 5*

We finished an early evening walk through Bishan Park at this restaurant. It is obviously popular and we were lucky to get a table (around 6.30 pm on a Saturday). Enjoyed the pear cider and beer. Food simple but came promptly. It was tasty and well priced compared to restaurants with similar menus in more "upmarket" locations such as the CBD. What stood out for us was the service. The staff bustled about! A rare sight here where apathy and lethargy (or hopeless confusion and lack of any clue) are usually the order of the day. It was a pleasure to see smiling staff being courteous and efficient. We did not have to wave frantically to attract attention. Staff watched their tables and anticipated our needs. They were knowledgeable and spoke English proficiently. It was lovely to watch - kind of like seeing a unicorn! (I'd given up seeing this in Singapore anywhere but a five star hotel)Perhaps we came on a good night, as others have had a different experience, but we will definitely give it another go.Probably best accessed by taxi or bus, although I believe there is a carpark in the park

Have tried this outlet twice.Food is delicious,but waiting can kill you,in term of queuing(weekend)and waiting for your food....30-45min.Here some tips,when yours food been serve,order your deserts or you have to wait another 30min.to be serve.Theirs hot/die die must try main course are Cheese burger and Fish burger($13,$14).Grilled chicken leg and roasted pork belly,($15).Beers are priced at $10.Ciders $13.and theirs Belgium Waffle w a scoop ice cream($8.) is worth before leaving

not very easy to access this eatery. we parked along ang mo kio ave 1 and walked a distance to the restaurant. nearest parking would be via sin ming ave. it is a 3 minutes walk to eatery. location is actually in ang mo kio park, not bishan park. you are asked to find seating by keying in your group size and sitting preference. queueing is not recommended. the staff are unfriendly upon arrival. the food is good though. we had the slow roasted pork belly and pork steak burger with fries. both were excellent. the staff that served our food and another who refilled our water (yes, they serve free ice water!) were much friendlier. might visit again becos of the food quality but the staff does deter me
