A little too pricy but the food was great! I loved the crisy roast chicken. The soup was nice too. Plenty of parking place but it gets a lot of people during peak hours.

Authentic and yummy Chinese food to bring guests here. I come here often with overseas guests or family (almost monthly). Of course this isn't fine dining so service is questionable, but the yummy food makes up for it. For 8 pax, was about $320 but you get your seafood for real. Anyway, being a family restaurant, expect loud conversations.Speaking of which, there were some rude Australians on 3rd Janaury 2018. I feel that there is a time and place for everything. This is a family restaurant. They should have brought their duty-unpaid 700 cl bottle and their entourage of about 10 noisy drunken stupor to perhaps a bar or a private function room. I do not know why the restaurant allowed them to continue in a little rowdiness. This is a shared space, and consideration to other patrons who could normally have a family conversation without shouting or screaming should be observed. Loud merry conversations are fine, but drunken singing for the upteenth time? Not ok.Also i do not believe they would sing the birthday song for the 5th or 6th time if they were in a private setting. Restaurant should have advised them to move on to a more appropriate setting and pls pay their monies in a function room or duty-paid hard alcohol. In an appropriate setting, I could actually enjoy the millionth time birthday song

There were 11 of us and we had so much food. Most of us loved the Thai steam soonhock, signature pork ribs & Tofu not to be missed! Pepper crab is better than the chilli (imo). Chilli lala really huge & fresh.  Fresh & Affordable seafood. Best for big groups.
1
Tipical chinese attitude, rude and absolutely not client friendly.Wrong dishes, no english and high prices. Ah take in consideration that 2$ will be charged for absolutely nothing. In case you will have a look inside, please pay attention at the body of dead fishes and the color of the water stored close to the toilet which they try to sell for 65$.DisgustingPlease stay away.Bye by

Por Kee Eating House has been around for a long time and has been an old favorite of my family. Went there again in Nov 2017 after a long while and the food still tastes just as good as we can recalled. Price is reasonable (if you do not order the crab or the more expensive variety of fish) and you can easily get a fulfilling meal by paying about S$25-S$30 per person. Two of us paid S$56 in total (inclusive of rice, tea and 7% GST) for champagne pork rib, home made bean curd (tofu) and lotus root soup. The serving is generous and the 3 dishes ordered are more than enough for 2 of us. Make a reservation (this is recommended) to get a dining table inside the air conditioned room. The crowd was thin when we were there for a weekday lunch and our orders were promptly served within 10 minutes after ordering.Do note that from mid Oct 2017 onwards, Por Kee is closed on every Monday.After a hearty meal, you can spend some time exploring the nearby famous Tiong Bahru Market & Food Centre to experience the local market atmosphere and cheap hawker food
5
it must be a decade cos i heard people saying, when i was young my grandma bring me here! almost all dishes are very home taste delicacy - feel like homelobster Yee Mian is special. a good place to bring family to eat. Can make a reservation, if you want it to be air-conditioned , reservation must be one month ago! ? ahhahahahhahah maybe we phone in a week in advance try and give me your view
4
Good restaurant but quite expensive for what you get. The chilli crab was very good. The thai fish very expensive for what it was. Very crowdy and there might be some language problem since it seemed that only one of the waiters had some knowledge about English.

Review by Dr Sim. Food is very good, which is what matters. Little or No ambience. Noisy but safe atmosphere. Tourists will get a feel of a local restaurant with good food. Order the cereal prawn, pork ribs with special champagne sauce, and watercress soup. Besides the locals, there were a few foreign guests eating there. Regards Dr Si
5
Fantastic food. We were taken to Por Kee by a friend who is working in Singapore and who had had the restaurant recommended to him by colleagues. We took our own wine and ate inside. The picked veggies on the table were delicious. There was a slight language barrier so we played safe and ordered sweet and sour pork (best I've ever tasted) fried rice (ditto) and spare ribs (amazing). Mango desert rounded it off - like Mango blancmange. We had a huge pot of jasmine tea and the service was very friendly. Tiong Baru is a great quarter with loads of places to eat and the weekend market sounds amazing. We will be back
5
Simply juicy and world class. This restaurant can be quite hard to locate but with google map you will be able to find easily. No reservation is required.
4
My all time favourite family eating place. Forget about the service. Food is tasty & fast, price is reasonable. I like the steam fish & the signature pork ribs.
5
In a car park, unassuming and really quite grungy, this place shines because of its fabulous food. Giant champagne pork ribs, fab chilli crab, yummy salted egg yolk prawns, gorgeous steamed sea bass, delicious tofu all noteworthy. It's air conditioned too which is not always the case with these type of restaurants. Probably BYO wine or just drink beer. We were taken here by our excellent tour guide, Ana Ong, and boy were we pleased with that choice.
4
Food are quite ok.Pork ribs and prawn cereal are the winner. Fish with thai spice is v ordinary and quite pricey.they have 3 sizes for each menu. Dont expect a good service because they are very busy even during weeknights. They gave us box of chocolates though at the end of our meal as compliment
5
Introduced by a relative to the delightful restaurant and become a regular after that. Love the easygoing staff and overall environment. Outdoor and indoor seating is available. But we enjoyed seating outdoor in the late afternoon.Our Favourite dishes : Thai Style Steam Fish (very refreshing), Champagne pork ribs (juicy and tender), Homemade tofu with sea cucumber (tofu was almost like smooth soft cheese texture)Recommended for those who are bored with those fancy over-the-top Chinese fusion restaurant and looking for the simplicity of delicious homestyle Chinese food.Portion was generous, bring friends to enjoy :
2
Had dinner here. We ordered chilli crab, cereal prawns, a green vegi dish and their signature toufu. Chilli crab was by flat and tasteless. Too much tomato ketchup i think. Cereal prawns was a tad too sweet although it tasted alright. The winning dish for the evening was the simple lightly fried soft toufu. In general felt a bit rushed although it was not fully booked. No tap outside for the washing of hands only. It means walking all the way into the restaurant and a waste of time trying to avoid the queues
5
A must try when you're in SG. Food is not that over-priced, a very good value for money. You're paying for the food quality...the taste is superb!!! Sg chili crab is delicious + the sizzling tofu + steamed prawns with loads of garlic. Rice is optional. Hehe!! Pls call the resto before coming here, to avoid the long wait / queue. Will definitely be back & will order cereal prawn and the pork ribs
5
Love the seafood hor fun with gravy. I have always ordered this one dish to go. Didn't bother to learn what hor fun was until I had this specific dish. Ordered the beef hor fun (without gravy) the last time I was there and didn't enjoy it, so will be sticking with seafood hor fun (with gravy) next time. Service is FAST. Every time I have been there, they have always managed to find us a seat quickly even if it looks like a full house. They are also very friendly. Feels like you're visiting your friend's house and the mom and group of aunties are trying to get you to eat

We had our annual division's cohesion dinner there that night to celebrate our achievements from the previous year. We weren't the only group celebrating something that night. Importantly this place has ample parking space right next to the restaurant. Despite being crowded that night, the service was up to par, food was really really tasty!! Have to try the coffee pork ribs, the salted egg prawn and the yam ring! The yam ring is really light and well cooked! Nicely seasoned! My colleagues even told me their spicy pickled appetiser was delicious! Locally we called it "achar" oh yes! And roasted whole chicken!!! Very little residual oil on the plate and yet the skin is crispy and the meat is tender!! I didn't manage to take much photos (cause was busy eating, haha) here's all I have.Ps: better to make a reservation before going down regardless of group size.Thanks for reading!Regards!Nick

This places has delicious food. It is frequented mostly by locals and their families. It seems that most of the staff did not speak English so only one person was able to take our order. This resulted is many delays. However the food was excellent. Chili crab was good and so was the cereal prawns. It was hot and the AC did not work well
5
Your mean is not complete without the Champagne Pork Ribs. You could add the beancurd with mushrooms and cereal prawns, along with sambal kangkong.
4
Had lunch here for business. They are willing to cater to my special diet. Food quality is nice and portion big. My business partners commented that the other food selection (prawn, crabs, abalone, chicken, fish....) are also very tasty. Staffs are attentive in changing plates.
2
Asked the waiter for a few extra minutes to look through the menu and requested that he come back later to take my order. His reply was "I have no time for you later". Thank you, your courtesy and honesty is greatly appreciated.
3
been there recently with colleague, ordered a tofu, vege and steamed fish.tofu is nice, vege is decent, the fish is fresh but not as tasty as what we expected it is.total bill was about 100 and i feel is ok.usual crowded tzi char place, i think its ok food at slghtly premium price i guess, havent try their signature disk but will consider to visit again for their signature food with larger group of ppl

My family and good friends decided to try Por Kee again after a long break and found it to be as delicious as ever evident by the crowds thronging the restaurant and corridors as early as 6 p.m.. We made a reservation and although we were seated outside along the corridor of a provision shop, it was comfortable. Service was prompt and the waitress gave us archar (pickles) to enjoy while we selected our Zhi Char dishes. Reviewers had recommended the champagne ribs and cereal prawns and we were not disappointed especially with the blended chillies and lime sauce which was more-ish and spicy.Beers were served in chilled mugs and tea was served promptly. Andrew the head server was helpful and you can ask for him as he will serve you well. We initially got a Chinese waitress to take our orders and that did not work out well as she only speaks mandarin and no English or dialects. She could not recommend any good dishes through no fault of hers. Therefore I recommend ordering delicious favourites through Andrew to be sure you don't get a duck when you ordered chicken

Came here for dinner with my overseas friends with our families for the first day of Chinese New Year. Firstly, the ambience of the restaurant could have been improved as well as the quality of service. Secondly, when you open an outdoor tentage to cater for overflow, always make sure the safety of the customers as well as for your staff as there were near accidents with the uneveness of the ground.Thirdly, even though its Chinese New Year period, a medium plate of stir fried vegetables should not cost more than $12 as I was charged over $20 for a measely plate.Fourthly, the cashiers at the counter got quite a couple of bills wrong and had overcharged a customer before me by nearly over $500 as their table bill amounted to nearly $800 and had caused quite a build up of customers behind them waiting for payment. It was a total chaos!Finally the quality of the food was above average and even though that it was a busy night, the quality of the food should not have detiorated in the taste since I have brought overseas friends to have their first taste of Singapore cooked food.If you ask me if I will visit here again in the near future, I would give it some real thoughts about it
4
Came for CNY dinner which was supposed to be a joyous occasion but ruined by their Captain, Andrew . We can understand how busy they must be but he was just ridiculously rude and basically didn't want us here. However, as usual the food turned out awesome with reasonable prices so just ensure for yourself that you don't get served by this guy to save yourself a happy meal.
5
Straight to the point: If I lived within walking distance of this place, I'd go for lunch or dinner everyday.The menu is diverse, the mood and atmosphere are just great. This is a traditional place, most of the patrons are singaporeans. Doesn't get more real than that.Of course, the real star is the food. I cannot recommend the champagne pork ribs enough. It is very succulent, and flavourful, that just typing this now (close to lunch time) is making me hungrier.Go, order a cold beer, check out the waiters bringing such unique dishes to the other tables, and find yourself having a very hard time deciding which one is better.If in doubt, go for the champagne pork ribs. You can thank me later
4
Great little find . Had the fried beef hor fun with black bean sauce for a late night dinner. Beef was so tender and sambal to accompany was delicious . The table across from us ordered the Champagne ribs and I will definately need to come back to try.
4
Had a family dinner there for the first time and found it to be worthwhile to travel all the way from the East for this zi char outlet. Their toufu and champagne pork ribs were exceptionally nice and above average. The butter prawns, hot plate venison and frog legs were also tasty
4
I had dinner here twice on my last visit and twice on the previous visit. It's not cheap, but the food is excellent. The Champagne Pork Ribs are justly famous, and the Roast Chicken is also good. Portions are large! The staff are friendly, but very keen to push you towards expensive seafood dishes like lobster, which are very good but can push the meal cost quite high. Inside is air-conditioned but very noisy - I have always sat outside, which overlooks the carpark. This is not fine dining - you go there for the food rather than the surroundings
4
We went there on a Sunday for dinner. We called at noon to reserve a table at 7pm but was told only outdoor seating was available. So we went early at 5:30 to secure indoor seating. If we did not book, we would not get a table even at 5:30. We ordered the Champagne Pork Ribs, Peppered Crab, tofu, Yam Ring with Veg for 2A1K. The food is tasty and very authentic Chinese, price reasonable. Service was efficient and no fuss. Highly recommended.
4
This is my second time to eat here. The last I came here was five years ago. In Singapore, eating seafood is quite popular and you can find many decent restaurant in town. The reason I recommend this restaurant is they have many signature dishes, like Champagne Pork Ribs, Chilly Crabs, Fried Chicken wings, etc.Especially, I like the Pork Ribs and it let me feel like a home-made flavor. Besides, they also serve many kinds of vege-dishes and you can ask them put a little bit chilly to cook.Please make a reservation or go there early before the busy hour
4
We called beforehand to book a table for 10 for a Saturday lunch. When we arrived, we were the only customers but gradually, more tables were taken up.We ordered a vegetable dish, the famed champagne pork ribs, tofu, the house special steam fish, roast chicken and hor fun. The tofu was nice and the caramelised pork rib was delicious. The hor fun had that "wok hei" was finished quickly. The fish arrived last and it was a fairly large red grouper. We didn't realise that the fish was a "live" fish and of course, that added quite a fair bit to the total bill. While we did not experience any bad service, we do note that the restaurant was very "encouraging" when we were ordering, unlike other restaurants which would gently tell you that you have ordered enough for your group.Overall, we enjoyed our meal. But we would double check on the fish should we order the house special again.
4
A few steps away from the cloying center of the "Williamsburg of Singapore." This long-standing local eatery provides quality local fare at reasonable prices. You don't get much in terms of beverage selections or service quality, but you get good quality food, served quickly in a bustling local atmosphere. Get it while you can. Recommend: Beef Horfun, Champagne Pork and Cereal Prawns
3
First time there was early 6.30pm for dinner had a bit crowd. Was told have to make reservations luckily my niece had a friend who's regular so they give us a table.We order butter prawn, roast pork, tah fu, veg and a whole duck which was told only available on sunday.Food was tasty, waiter didn't advise that our order was a little too much. Especially the whole duck stuff with many ingredients .Couldn't finish have to take away. We have 4 adult 2 kids.The roast pork was cut too big a piece that you cannot put into your mouth.Otherwise this zi char stall food is okay
4
No doubt, there may be other great che zar places in Singapore, but to me, this ranks among the best. Food is consistently good and while the waitstaff can be a bit abrupt and direct at times, that just adds to the charm. This is one of those places that would be great to eat in with a big group, because then, you'd be able to order many dishes to try. Every time my partner and I would come here to eat, we'd end up ordering more than what we could possibly consume, and the waiter who would take our order, would tell us frankly that we're ordering too much. This is the only restaurant I've been to where the waiter will tell you you're ordering far too much! What to order? The restaurant menu is extensive but we usually end up getting a fried rice (either the seafood or the yang chow), the homemade bean curd, salted egg prawns (we usually get this de-shelled, for which our waiter would always shake his head and say that the one with shell was better) and champagne pork ribs. As for price, this would be more expensive than other restaurants of the same kind, particularly those found in hawker centers, but I still think this is great value for money, based on quality of food and the serving
1
My extended family and I have patronised this restaurant for countless number of years. We like some of the dishes there including a particular vegetable dish which the kids like very much. On our last visit there, we ordered the same vegetable dish but were served a different vegetable. The kids could tell the difference immediately upon trying the first piece and they said it was not as nice. So the adults naturally tried too and we found the vege different too. We asked if they have cooked the wrong vege for us but the managers (a woman and man behind the counter) vehemently insisted that they have been using this vege for 20 over years and that we were the ones who have made a mistake. They did not show appreciation for our long term patronage and had no qualms about ridiculing our knowledge about vegetables. They talked back loudly and rudely and told us not to order that dish in the future when all we hoped for was a simple 'sorry'. We were very, very disappointed at the way they treated long-time customers like us. We walked away immediately and will never return again. As consumers, we should stand up against food sellers who think they are the greatest and who do not care about customer service. This is indeed very, very bad customer service
4
I ate here as part of a large group. The food kept coming, so did the beers and a good night was had by all. There's an indoor restaurant, but we sat outside where there's around half a dozen plastic picnic-style tables that'll seat about ten. Chilli and pepper crab are the specialities, but there's other tasty selections on the menu too. It's not fancy and beers stop at 10.30 to comply with liquor sales requirements, but if you want local, this is it. And tasty with it
1
Staff Andrew (look at my picture) refused to close the door to the restaurant, because he wanted to move in and out of the restaurant without hassle. Very selfish and inconsiderate of him to do so, as all the customers were feeling hot in the restaurant.What's the point of air con in the restaurant then, since your staff looked after his welfare above the customers' welfare? The cold air was just flowing out, and the hot air was just coming into the restaurant. Aren't you worried about your electric bills? Or even your own customers' comfort?What a waste.Despite me and my husband closing the door several times on our own, this person called Andrew told me to stop, and would open the door wide open in front of us. All of us ate our meals uncomfortably with the hot tropical air flowing into the restaurant. Thanks. I hope this one star would let Andrew know he is a selfish person and is not helping his company at all

Went to Tiong Bahru to see the latest murals, and one of which is located right in front of Por Kee. The food and service didn't disappoint us, and prices were reasonable.
3
Food is average... Just like any other similar places... Service is not too good.
Prices are very reasonable.
Very pack during weekends...
4
a great family dinning place with its famous champagne pork ribs, prawn paste chicken, steamed seabass fish all makes it a sumptuous lunch or dinner for friends and family
5
The best in this price range, hands down. The staff are efficient. Good service too.
We love the champagne ribs, sweet and sour pork, and any type of fish.
Highly recommended.
4
A friend, who lives in Singapore, recommended this restaurant as one frequented by locals. We were glad he did. The food was fersh and delicious and a groupmof waitresses made sure that everything at our tablke was as it should be.
5
Came here on a local friend's recommendation and everything was delicious - from the fried tofu to chili crab to champagne pork ribs to the steamed fish. Definitely a highlight. Service was okay but that was expected.
5
I love this place! Poh Kee has been around for a long time and closed for a short period a couple of years ago but absolutely delighted the owner decided to come out of retirement. Poh Kee is a casual dining Chinese restaurant which serves popular dishes like chili crab, oatmeal prawns and amazing 'champagne ribs'. Every time I go to Singapore I make an effort to dine there at least once. Bookings are recommended as they are very popular especially at weekends
5
This is a restaurant that I never miss whenever I am in Singapore. Its location at Tiong Bahru is not at the centre of the tourist belt but it is just a short taxi ride from Orchard Road or Chinatown. Our familiar favourites include the Thai-style steamed sea bass, deer meat with ginger and onion, coffee pork ribs and the belacan kangkong. Most of the clientele are locals and reservation is a must for dinners on both weekdays and weekends.
4
We decided to try Por Kee as it was recommended by my friend. It was a Saturday night around 8pm, we got seated (out door) after 5mins. Probably you will need to wait, if you have requested for indoor seats. We ordered cereal prawn, signature homemade tofu, champagne short pork rib, baby kailan (veg), sotong youtiao, prawn sauce fried chicken, seafood crispy noodle and fish maw soup.Overall, I think the food are not bad. Dishes which I would order again will be fish maw soup, cereal prawn and seafood crispy noodle. Service is good enough. Tea and wet towel is compulsory. 8 dishes with 7 bowls of rice for 5 pax is $132 ($26per pax).
4
Tucked away in the heart of nostalgic yet hip Tiong Bahru area, Por Kee has stood the test of time and survived the onslaught of upmarket western food and brunch places sprouting up all around it. Because it is one of a handful of traditional Chinese restaurant in the area, it stands as a bastion of the heritage of Tiong Bahru and it's good food attest to that. Also because of these factors it is always crowded and any patron must be prepared to wait for a table, to order food and for the food to arrive. It helps to call way ahead to reserve a table especially if you have big group. But the food makes up for all the waiting. Retaining the authentic Chinese style and flavor, the food never fails to tickle your palate and bring the culinary experience to a new level. With the survival of traditional Chinese restaurants under threat in the Tiong Bahru area, Por Kee may be the reason for foodies to push back.
5
A group of seven of us went to have chilli crab, pepper crab, steamed sea bass, and pork ribs. It was messy, delicious and very well priced. For no frills fresh fish excellence this was unbeatable. we had a lovely time, plastic tables, fast service, and a rapid turnover of happy customers. Very highly recommended.
4
Had been living there my entire life, restaurant is right behind my house, so we know the bosses very well and always gets our fav dessert "Yam paste". this is tradition canto style hot dessert and mom/aunties will love it. The place got famous when ex-indo president insist on the champagne prok ribs and you def wont be dissapointed. Must try all the seafood but price will be steep, so just chose the ones you really wanna try and they will cook it, and like express chef, food served will be faster than you can say I-Love-I-eat-I-will-tell-alot-of-friends.Old school services so all the aunties will be pro and they knew what you need/want, and they will even tell you stuff that you dun really want, but can still enjoy the food, Space will be an issue if there are a handful of Caucasians or Austrian Rugby team in tow, so get the non-AC outdoor seating, cool breeze and the occasional big birds singing in the background. Pay no attention to the car park nor the drain nearby as those definitely does not belongs to the restaurant. All in all dishes i recommend will be those mentioned above and the bamboo clams. Fish will be seasonally fresh so knock at the right time (or asked). the old-style crispy-skin chicken will be good to have with the home-made tofu. Cereal Prawns Yam basket to name a few. Enjo
5
Yes you are eating on the edge of a car park and yes the service isn't anything to rave about. But my oh my, the food at Por Kee is simply the best Chinese food I have ever had. I have been eating here for the last 10 years or so and make sure that every time I visit Singapore that this place is on my 'to do' list! The champagne ribs are to die for!!
5
This restaurant is located in one of the small streets in Tiong Bahru. The restaurant is always crowded so be sure to make a reservation beforehand. My friend celebrated her birthday here. We order food good for 10 pax and it only cost her like $120-$150. Good food and value for money
3
If you look for a romantic restaurant or you are a bit frightened about hygiene it is maybe not the place to come. Indeed, the place look a bit ROCK'N'ROOL as the table are in the streets, the trash bins were just behind us, toilets were a bit dirty, aquarium water had a strange green color. But in the end, the food was fine and generous
1
We booked this restaurant for my brothers' birthday celebration for 14 pax . I requested for a big table of which they said its not available over phone booking. On the day itself, we requested for a big table again but was told there isnt. We had to spilt into 2 tables. Lady boss came and demanded we squeeze all into 12 (2 no show) into one small table of which it was not possible. Staff then apologised and rolled out a bigger table top to accomodate all of us. All this while our dishes were turning cold.Appalling business conduct and rude. Food was average only by the way
4
The food was great, fun atmosphere when you go with family or friends. Pick outside dining area when it is not raining as the place can be steamy hot inside. Try the chilly crab or black pepper crab dish when you are there is a must. Make sure you ordered a cab in advance or you drive as it is hard hail a cab after dinner by the road side
4
For people who grew up in Tiong Bahru area, a few places do not change and Por Kee is one of them. I remembered eating my first Champagne Pork Ribs at this establishment and everyone sat at table placed under the numerous trees just beside the car park lots. After the place was put up for sale and closed down for a while, I have not been there again.To be frank, please do not expect 5 star service from this place and to pay for the establishment, incidental charges can be exorbitant. However, take it as a means of supporting the owners to continue operating and keep the staff employed.If looking for a reasonable priced meal, I will recommend this place for local Cantonese fare
1
If you haven't check your bill, please do! There is SGD 3 charge per person regardless you consume any tea or otherwise. I have a 3 year old toddler who was charged SGD 3 for tea & pickle. When I question why there is a charge for a toddler, the answer was provided that "so long the child does not sit on the baby chair, it will be charged!" But I explained that my toddler does not even drink tea or consume any pickles... My comments were fell on deaf ears and ignored thus, it was charged at once as if I did not even made any comment! This restaurant has bad service and the tea & pickle charge is totally unreasonable and out right to make the mere SGD 3. Beware even though you refuse the tea or pickle IT WILL STILL BE CHARGED PER PERSON. Will never return again
1
I used to like this restaurant very much for good taste...but Today I thought I brought friends and family of 10 to enjoy good food which I knew for several years. But today I am very disappointed of what happen to the kangkong betacan which has one big cockroach. Making worse the response of the owner who said. Sorry I can not control this... The fact that this people are not surprise or shock this must have been a regular happening, I can't imagine the kitchen is invested with big cockroaches. Terrible. This will be the last time I will visit this restaurant. Beside the quality of the food have been lower that it used to be
3
This is very popular with the locals, and the taste justifies its popularity, the food is good and the price is reasonable. However the staff attitude at the restaurant stink, they are rude, don't expect to be served like a prince
4
Lovely local food. Not to be missed if you are in the area. Busy but they managed to fit us in. Had a mix of dishes and all excellent.
3
The food here is delicious, we had pork rib, prawn in a garlic sauce, morning glory and a fish in a tom yum sauce. We went for an authentic, local, Singapore dinner and experience. We had to sit outside which was fine, it was a beautiful night, but eating outside meant that we were subject to what lives outside
1
I went there with my friends for lunch at 1pm today. I saw there were some customers eating in the restaurant & many empty tables. But the Manager, refuse to let us seat inside the restaurant. He said if we want, we can sit outside. We were so disappointed by his action. We will not recommend this place to anyone. Bad service... The other nearby restaurant Sin Hoi Sai resturant's food & service is the best..
4
Casual place where locals go for food, not decor. Nice to be away from shopping malls. A local place where tourists wouldn't really know to venture unless they have friends in SG. Good local dishes, tasty, hot. Generous serves, at decent prices. We had party of 10 for lunch on Sunday. Not completely full at the time, so quite pleasant. Commendable dishes - butter prawns, fried chicken with shrimp paste, chau hor fun, fried bean curd, kang kong w belacha
4
Have been patronising Por Kee for years until they closed and re-opened. Glad that the standard of food has improved after they re-opened. The simple dishes such as Hor Fun and Bee Hoon are full of wok hei and hit the right notes. This is one place that still serves their Yang Zhou Fried Rice with real char siew instead of the fake crabsticks that every eatery is so fond of using as a replacement, I am a fan of their signature Champagne Pork Ribs and their new creations such as the Deep Fried Fish Skin. Sure, its not a glamorous restaurant with limited air conditioned room seating. However the outdoor seating feels some what right. Be adventurous and try out Por Kee. You won't regret it
4
Not the usual high end looking place, but a small, simple and traditional air-conditioned eating house - can hold around 7-8 tables. Its located at Tiong Bahru housing estate, Seng Poh Rd, opposite the re-furbished Tiong Bahru market and food centre.Our group of 12 settled in well on a large round table. Service was very friendly and efficient.First was traditional lo-hei, given the CNY season. We then ordered: Thai style steam fish (marble goby), champagne pork ribs, yam ring, cereal prawns, kai lan, house special home made deep fried bean curd, beef with spring onion & ginger, noodle. Everything was good - some thought its like good quality zi-char but I thought it was just great quality Cantonese home style dishes. In my opinion the fish was the best. I think my team mates agreed too. This is the first time for most of us in the team. The recommendation came from one of us who tried the restaurant recently and found the food to be good. Heard that the place had a long history (Tiong Bahru is actually quite a old housing estate) and there was some falling out between the family that runs the business a few years back and the restaurant cloased but that's been settled and Por Kee is operating again.I'll want to bring my folks and in-laws to try out this place. Guarantee they will like it. So will youReservations are highly recommended given the limited seating capacity

Really happy to have this place in my neigbhourhood. Consistently very good local food without any pretention at all. Sit and eat in the parking lots with the locals. Signature dishes are the cereal prawns and the champagne pork ribs. Reservations definitely recommended. Staff are no nonsense and run efficiently like Chinese restaurants are. Two choices of beer and bring your own wine. Great value and we always bring our out of town guests here. Really recommended

Great selection of local dishes that is typical of the iconic local zhe char eateries. Por Kee has pleased the palates of generations and has retained much of its original charm though the vicinity of Tiong Bahru has changed considerably. It's not one of the hip cafes or new dangled eateries that abound in proximity. Expect good old fashioned zhe char dishes in a casual environment and you won't be disappointed. The salted egg sotong (local word for squid) is superb! Champagne pork ribs and ngoh hiang (seafood rolls) are highly recommended too. Salted fish fried rice and beef hor fun were good staples. Service is efficient but don't expect more than that.

Visited this place for the first time as it was well recommended by friends. Tried the specialities such as the pork ribs and steamed fish in thai sauce. The fish was fresh and the sauce/soup can be too spicy for others but it was really good. My fave is really the pork ribs which was a big enough portion for the price. Glad to hear that the eatery has opened again. I will definitely return and try more of their dishes. If you are a big group, it will be good to call and make a reservation in advance as it can be quite busy even for a weekday dinner

The food here is always good ... If you manage to get a table. This place is always crowded. Expect to wait and also to sit outside near the carpark.

If you can accept some noises, dinning with locals, and great food, then this is the place! Must try its fritter dough, champagne pork ribs and fried chicken.

Por Kee provides a large selection of excellent Cantonese dishes. The ribs and deep fried fish were both fantastic. The beef and ginger was so good we got a second dish.We had a table outside, set back from the car park and it was very pleasant. The beer could have been a little colder, but that did not detract from a wonderful meal
3
Open again after being closed for sometime with the same poor service. Our favorites include Thai styled live Sea Bass and Cereal Prawn. The Champagne Pork Ribs were a let down this time because they were dry. Overall we will still be back for the familiar food

On a rainy day, decided to have diner. Found this place by coincidence and sat outside. The staff does its job properly and was efficient. The food arrived within reasonable time and it was good. Considering the price (25 sgd) it was good value for money

Went for husband's birthday celebration lunch, Champagne pork rib & butter crab was good!also like the fried crispy soon hock, no complaint of the food, sure will be back for more, it's better to reserve table (we did), saw some of the business/well dress diners have to sit outside without air-con
5
Usual birthday celebrations will be held in a restaurant. But this time, I chose to celebrate it the Singapore way - non-air-con dining with good local food! Champagne pork ribs have to be reserved in advance, we tried only the chef's recommended dishes like steam fish, crab bee hoon, stuffed chicken and crispy prawns. Will be back for more

Authentic Singapore Zhi Char stall. Food is good and not too highly priced comparing to the bigger restaurant group. They serve nice Tofu on hot plate, and the fresh prawn in herbal stock "yao chai xia" is worth a try. The indoor have got limited tables and be prepared to have a out door seat along the walk way of the opened car park. There is ample staff around and it is not difficult to get an attention for service when require. Service overall is normal and price is not too expensive. Good for a decent seafood dinner

Arrived in Singapore the weekend just passed and this was the first port of call, upon discovering it's re-opening. The chilli crab was amazing as usual, the champagne pork ribs to die for, cereal prawns a must-order item and the bean shoot sprouts tenderly delicious! The shutdown revamped the inside of the restaurant, but to eat here, you must dine in the open air

I was gutted when I found they closed "for renovations" without any impending re-opening date. Then friends told me they had re-opened with the same chef so of course I have to go check that the food is still good. Well, I'm happy to report the food is still fantastic. Only the homemade tofu is slightly different (they gave the tofu a bit deeper fry than usual, resulting in tougher skin), but still very tasty. Even most of the grumpy staff is still there, but nobody comes here for the service.Breaking news: there was no renovations done to the place at all. It's still the same shabby eating house in the same old parking lot. Again, who cares, nobody comes here for the ambiance. We ordered the classics: homemade tofu with its lip-smackingly awesome sauce and silky (on the inside) fresh tofu, sweet-salty-sticky champagne pork ribs, spicy-sour Thai-style soon hock fish, tender saucy venison with ginger and spring onions, and the funky crunchy xiangmai (wheat vegetable) stir-fried in fermented tofu sauce. WHAT AN EPIC MEAL. There's a reason this place is my favorite local Singapore-style Chinese restaurant on the island, it never fails to deliver. Book a table inside, a week in advance. Eating outdoors sounds good in theory, but OMFG Singapore is always hot and this restaurant is literally located in a parking lot. Do the math

Its reopened. We were told chef had recovered from bad back - hmmm thought brother sister had fallen out. Old boss lady not around and food definitely not as good as before. Prices still rich.
3
They have already closed down. Heard the owner sold the business. But till now there are no new developments.
1
Rude and terrible customer service especially the old Aunty who was supposed to be the boss. Her attitude was loud voice and rude to few customers that we witnessed and my personal experienced too. My friends and I will boycott this restaurant :(

Brought my friend's aunt to try this place and she was impressed. The food here never fails. The service is rather good even though they were very busy. Impressive!

I feel so fortunate to have friends & family in Singapore otherwise there would've been no other way I would have found out about these types of places..you'll definitely not find it on a tourist map (in fact, the area is not touristy at all) but just get on a taxi and they'll be able to find the place (probably even know the restaurant) without trouble..I first ate here 2 years and loved it so much it was the first stop I wanted to make the day I landed...then I was horrified when my cousin informed me it was closed!...it was such depressing news...how can such a place close down when you have the Sultan of Brunei as a regular (and there's certainly nothing fancy about this place)?!...then the day I was leaving a friend told me he saw the place open and I had to go see for myself...it was my lucky day!!..the place was packed as I remembered but I didn't mind the long wait since I already knew what I was in for...and finally, probably on my list of Top 10 meals, I ordered the Champagne Pork Ribs...I was in Heaven...it was all I ate this time...and I ordered it a second time since I don't know when will I ever have it again..sniff.

Past all the usually brightly lit Main Street establishment was this little ripper. Walked passed it on the first day wondering and noticed how packed it was with locals compared to all the others. Service was great, food was sensational and cheap to boot. Suggest booking or arriving early or be prepared to wait for a table, well worth the wait. Can recommend the Scollops and the Pork, mouth watering.

Ordering black pepper crabs is a must. The dish is certainly one of the best I have had in Singapore so far. It is spicy enough for chilli-lovers.I only manage to get a table outdoor. Given the humid weather, I have been soaked with my own sweat whilst cracking the shell. But it is nevertheless a very nice experience.Do not expect the staff to be attentive. They do not sell service. But they watch your interest. They will tell you how much and what portion to order in order not to waste food.In terms of location, it is not far away from China Town. There is also a wet market nearby I believe

Thankfully our beloved Por Kee has opened again. I live next door and this has always been our reliable 'zu char' Chinese place - casual, outdoor (ie parking lot and sidewalk) eatery. Apparently there was a family dispute which resulted in its close-down and now the sister is gone and the other family members have reopened it. Most importantly the menu is the same and the same chefs are back! The house specialties of champagne pork ribs (get the long ones) and the cereal prawns (western people - get the shells removed) are back! They are as good as ever and the menu truly is the same.The wait staff seem to be new and as with all Chinese restaurants, service is always spotty - hurried, screaming, loud, shouting, everyone doing everything but this is the charm of Chinese restaurants - just go with it. The food is worth it.Reservations are definitely recommended - gets very busy and on the first reopening week (14APR) the tables were already packed - good word gets around fast. So happy Por Kee is back! Welcome back porky!

Ambience ... nothing extraordinary from typical restaurant with minimal air-con seatingFood ... generally on spicier end by local standards ... Am surprised that a good percentile of patrons are foreigners and comfortable with the spice levelService ... they have tried their best ... but staff are generally overwhelmed by hoarding crowd ...Value for money ... reasonably priced in comparison to eateries within the vicinity ... but slightly higher by generic local context ... do expect $20-$30 per pax for decent dinner with fish and prawnsWill be back again in hope for better food and service quality ... Am sure that they can do bette

As I am staying not too far, I love to come here. You can eat simple chinese food or you can choose some very good dishes. The price is reasonable. The service is efficient (I like the old aunties!!). You have to come early if you want to have place for dinner. I prefer to be inside for the air con but most of the places are outside
4
Good chinese food, value for money in pricey Singapore. Try out the bbq ribs n the duck. Parking can be difficult. Loads of other interesting food outlets nearby as well.
4
Always consistent, always busy. All the usual 'tze char' favorites are on the menu. You really can't go too wrong at this place. Service is of course not what you're here for, but the food is. Make sure you order the champagne ribs.
5
i like all the food there, home made tofu, steamed fish, oatmeal prawn...all delicious. Must try their yam paste, it is the best. Staffs are friendly, place also clean. I always return.
5
Delicious food at a very reasonable price. The beef bee hoon is delicious as is the sea bass. If you want to try local food, Por Kee is the place.

I had stayed at Tiong Bahru area for 3 years and I didn't know about this famous restaurant until friend's birthday dinner. Reservation is highly recommended if you are going on any weekend, especially if you want to have air-conditioned area as there only have limited spaces for the indoor.It is located right opposite Tiong Bahru Market. It is an old school Chinese restaurant that has been in operation since 1996(if I am not mistaken as you can see the title putted as 1996). If you google online, you can find many review, those who commented disappointingly mainly said the standard dropped a lot. For me as a 1st timer, I feel it is consider quite a good experience, i just have to avoid ordering certain food for my next visit. We spent $164.20 for 9 of us.Must try: Signature Homemade Toufu, Yam Basket and of course the Champagne pork rib

I have been to Por Kee a number of times over the years and have seen them expanding steadily. This time we ordered the ribs, crab in cheese sauce, beef with scallion and ginger, a soup, beef beehoon and kangkung belacan. It was my first time ordering crab in Por Kee base on my friend's recommendation.The food as usual was very good. But the pleasant surprise was how good the quality of the crab was. It was medium size and packed with solid meat! I told my wife we don't need to go to Eastcoast anymore to look for good crabs!I will be back to try their Singapore and black pepper crabs

Staandard have dropped signifincantly. Feels like eating instant microwaved food. Foods are now served 1 minute after order entry (we ordered 6 dishes, all served within 7 minutes, including claypot tofu in 15 seconds). Foods are mosly cold or at best lukewarm. Terribly overpriced as more tourist patronizing ($300 for 6 dishes) Taste of food and freshness deteriorates significantly. Wouldnt return for a long time.

Located in the heart of Tiong Bahru, Kor Pee has in recent years expanded and its tables overflow the adjacent car-park and occupy the adjacent 5-foot walkways. The service too has improved, with wait-staff ordering into hands-free microphones, crisp-linen covered tables and decent wine-glasses. In tandem with these improvements the eatery has seen an `upgrade` of its clientele which is more cosmopolitan and groups at business dinners are common. Mercifully, the food remains the same - it has a wholesome flavor and makes for a hearty relaxed meal

My partner and I have been regulars here for over two years. Its popularity continues to soar particularly with my fellow ang mos who like to BYO wine. The food offering is somewhat limited but a number of dishes excel - champagne pork especially. On our most recent visit we had the roast (fried?) chicken, the seafood yam basket, and a mixed vegetables - all well executed. The prices have crept up but still represent good value by Singapore standards. The outdoor sitting, despite being surround by parked cars, is great for evenings as the temperature drops. Service is efficient

This place has been around for a very long time, evident in the age of the servers who have been working there almost their whole lives. The standard of cooking has been maintained well, and I can safely say this because I've been going there regularly for more than 7 years. Don't be afraid of the loud, fierce aunties and occasional uncles, they're just not fine-dining trained.Their specialties are champagne pork ribs, Thai-style steamed fish, hor fun (flat, wide rice noodles) with beef in black bean sauce, homemade tofu, and the venison with ginger and spring onions. These dishes are always incredible every time. Other dishes are good, but forgettable.Try to avoid going during Chinese festive seasons (Lunar New Year, Mid-Autumn Festival), it's insanely crowded and they extend makeshift tables to the far end of the carpark, and to the side of the next block. It also takes forever for the food to arrive. If you must go during the festive season, make a reservation
