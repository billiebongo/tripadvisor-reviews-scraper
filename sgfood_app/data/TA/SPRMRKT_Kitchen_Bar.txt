The salmon donburi bowl was decent, reasonably fresh ingredients, the egg omelette though was very average

Location is great. Ambiance is definitely suitable big groups. Food is great, as always. Thank you for having us, and the great service. Cheers!

High hopes were dashed. The food was unmenorable and atmosphere was non-existent. Great location and very pleasant staff sadly couldnâ€™t save this as a Rob Quay regular.

Good western food and I liked the wine. The atmosphere was really nice. Not to crowded and near to the river with nice view.
The waiters where lovely.

I came here for dinner with friends before we left Singapore. We all ordered steak. Cooked perfectly - loved it.

Definately love the at atmosphere and the well attentive service staff.Morevwr we did not wait too long for the food

If your after good coffee(espresso) down by the river - recommended. Good coffee in Singapore is hard to find, but SPRMKRT delivers a good drop! with a good selection of cakes to choose from with coffee.

Actually earlier in the day, my other half and I had our breakfast at SPRMRKT along McCallum St when we had a workshop at STPI thus chancing upon SPRMRKT Kitchen & Bar...We ordered the Cast Iron Pancake and it was delicious. Soft and moist. Do add the ice cream though! It goes well with it.Service was on point as well though we were there on a Monday so it wasn't very crowded

We have lived in Singapore for over two years now and are so glad SPRMRKT opened near us! Food wise, I would say for Singapore its great value, its not very often you go to a restaurant and get change from $50 for two people for dinner (sans Alcohol). The carbonara is highly recommended! I once had my side order forgotten and we has finished our meals before we got it, so they gave it to us on the house. This rarely happens in Singapore! So I was thankful for their gesture. It's probably not the best food in Singapore but it has a range of choice which makes things easier for groups and value wise I think its pretty good

When you wake up with a hangover on Sunday and you just want to chill during brunch, go here, sit back and relax.Service was very good, friendly and attentive staff. The location is very nice as it provides you front row seating to see all the active (probably not hangover) people running by. The food was alright, not exiting, but fulfilled the need

Went here with family and friends...wonderful place for a cosy weekend brunch!
Food was very well presented and executed. Service was attentive and firendly.
Highly recommended!

Went there for Sunday Brunch and had great time. All we've tried was really good. Just limited choice of dessert in my opinion.

Came here for a quick breakfast before lunch. The building has 3 floors featuring the kitchen & bar, bakery and shop. My friend and shared only had 2 dishes - pasta & pancake. Great place for catch ups!

It's been awhile that I've experienced such wonderful patient staff who without knowing went out of their way and turned a really bad day around for everyone. A big thank you to the team at SPRMKT in helping make the birthdays girl day! :)

Nice place for a quiet afternoon tea or a nice brunch with friends. Steak was a tad disappointing. Love the Yorkshire as well as the bread and butter pudding though!

Thoroughly enjoyed my experience here, service was fantastic with the 2 servers for my visit. Loved our brunch dishes and hoping to come back to dine for dinner one day.

I had the chicken burger with fries. Food was pretty average and the fries were a bit pale. Location is nice on the canal and it's a relaxing atmosphere that's why I suppose it's a little pricey. Next time I would try the brunch there, for dinner I would try some of the other restaurants there. The art gallery upstairs had a Hockney exhibition, that's why we went there.

The menu is very limited for vegetarian and it's confusing booking the sprmkt cafe and the kitchen & bar. The menu served at the cafe has more variety and cheaper than kitchen & bar when they share the same central kitchen for food preparation and cooking.I ordered a handmade pasta and it was overloaded with tomato sauc

This restaurant is less than 5 minutes walking distance from our hotel - Studio M in Robertson Quay. My wife and I just saw their sign board and we made sure we had a meal here. Fresh juices, great sandwiches and lovely salads! Add to that an al-fresco styled dining with great views of the Singapore River

It is not a new experience for the chef to check up on the dining experience of their patrons -- but for my first time visit to SPRMRKT, Chef Joseph, not only made sure we enjoyed our culinary sojourn but he also tried to explain my question: why the bread serving was small. He satisfactorily explained it and he sent another serving, this time, with a jam, something which they didn't offer during our visit. I always love going to Roberson Quay during weekends but my maiden trip to SPRMRKT is quite special. Thank you to the team for making sure we are well-taken cared of during our brunch. e
