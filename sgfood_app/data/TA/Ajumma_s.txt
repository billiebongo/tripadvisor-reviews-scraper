The dishes are so tasty so flavourful. Its pocket-friendly prices, comes with a discount on the present of movie subs. The beef is delicious, the pot of steam egg is eggcellent. One of my go-to places when I am feeling in need of comfort food.

If you are looking for quick easy eats, this could be your choice. Not the authentic Korean kinda food, but nevertheless quick simple fix. Tasty too. Very popular amongst the teens. :)

We come to this place for the beef kalbi. In addition to beef kalbi we sometimes have the pork or chicken bulgogi. Pricing is very reasonable given the location and that is it more or less a fast food joint.

I ordered the beef bibimbap, army stew, steamed eggs, and sweet (honey) pancakes.(MUST TRY) The sweet pancakes were my ultimate favourite. $3.90 for two pancakes, it's almost as though they put two hotcakes together, slathered honey and red bean in between, and deep fried the thing!Personally, I found the beef bibimbap a little underwhelming - because of the lack of flavour - and the meat was a little too tough and fatty for my liking.The army stew could have been a little spicier - and it was truly average.Steamed eggs were a good buy! A generous serving for $5.90 - enough to share between 3 people

I was at Cathay and needed to grab a bite before the movie started. Ajumma had space and I really needed dinner so we went there. I was expecting the food to be mediocre but I was surprised.My army stew was spicy and flavorful while my girlfriend's beef soup was tasty and sweet. The kimchi pancake was awesome.The quality of the food here is good and I guess Ajumma would be my go to choice if I am at Cathay

Ordered a bibimbap, army stew and steamed egg for sharing. The portion of the bibimbap and army stew was pretty big, the taste doesn't lose out to some other Korean restaurants out there, but the side dishes were pretty salty. The steamed egg was quite watery too, though the other two dishes were just fine.

The food here is delicious! Been here many times, we always order the spicy chicken, signature Beef kalbi and kimchi pancake. My friends love the beef because the marinade is so fragrant and they use really good tender beef. My favourite is the spicy chicken. Also, the appetisers like steam eggs and the fried chicken seem to be very popular around the other tables. So far most of the dishes here that we have tried have not disappointed us. Prices are very pocket friendly too

The food was really good, especially the Beef Kalbi and Army Stew. We also shared a Kimchi Pancake and it was yummyyyyy! Very crispy and full of flavour. The beef is slightly fatty though, maybe cos it's beef ribs. But it's so tender and packed with flavour. Reminds me of the food I had when i was in Seoul. Prices are good too, about $10 per meal, and comes in a full set with rice and side dishes

ordered the spicy dry ramen, korean fried chicken and the chicken bugogi.Took a seat and had a good view of the kitchen. was looking a around the resturant and saw 1 of the chef taking out a packet of instant ramen (the famous extreme spicy dry ramen that was on the news). the next moment i know, its served on the plate and heading towards me. omg. instant noodles?! seriously? add an egg, 3 slice of cucumbers, a hotdog and some seaweed and it cost $8.90?! worst thing is how unhealthy it is. i got issues with shops serving instant noodles. but they should be up front about it so that the customers are aware. the korean chicken is a failure too. tasteless and hard like a stone. btw, 6 pieces chicken means 1 wing cut into 2. so 3 wings x 2 pieces = 6 pieceslastly the chicken bugogi. the only normal and edible food out of the 3 dish.
