The place has a great ambience and superb food to go along with it. Enjoyed the grilled salmon with soup. A fantastic experience. They have a wide variety of dishes coupled with excellent service

Back again to this very good restaurant. Service, food and value for money is at the TOP end of the scale. These guys try so hard to be a success that they deserve to be successful. Thank you. Really good night.

The service is excellent, the food is pretty creative and interesting. We ordered Pan grilled chicken & Chilli Crab Squid Ink Pasta w/58 degree egg. Dessert is chocolate fudge cake Price is reasonable but they do offer fine dining at a hefty price, of course.
5
Great food with great service and chef is full of passion about his food..
thoughtful service with great recommendation.
We have a great time and would definitely visit again

Really enjoyed the beautiful food that is created. Chris was very friendly and attentive. Fantastic service.
5
Fine French fare infused wtih Singapore nostalgic flair. A splash of creativity and a whole lot of passion. Sophiisticated. Cheeky. Every dish was a sensual delight. Thank you Donna and Chris for an enchanting evening. Chef Matthew, you definitely deserves a Michelin star or two!

It was meant to be an anniversary dinner which become a proposal surprised for me. Service - The waitress explained each of the dishes at the back of her mind. The food served was collaborate with Chef Matthew Mok and Chef Cornelius Speinle. The menu they served has unique combinations that bring in Chinese and Western fusion. In prior to that, my fiancÃ© connected with Donna and Chef Matthew on the proposal event. They are very helpful, friendly and provide suggestion on how to run the proposal event. Food - The food they served was seasonal menu and the food was excellent, the food name was creative and unique. We both enjoyed ourselves. We both had a memorable evening that night

It is rare to have a perfect dining experience, but my dinner at The Rabbit Stash last month was certainly one of them.Service:Donna was exceptionally helpful from the moment I made the first phone call to book the reservation. She was understanding and patient when I had to inform her of the (many) food restrictions that my (then) girlfriend had. However, what struck me the most was the help and advice that she rendered when I informed her that I was planning to propose during the dinner such as choosing the ideal seat, arranging for a special cake with the special message and preparing for the presentation of the bouquet at the right time. Her team was equally helpful during the dinner itself as well. Food:Both of us had the 7 course Ensophi menu. Every single dish was a delight to both our sight and taste buds. There was not a single dish that we did not enjoy. We were very impressed by the Chef Matthew's creative take on local dishes such as "assam fish" and "chicken rice". I could never have imagine that our local dishes could converted into something so exquisite. Despite it being a 7 course meal, the portion of each course was very generous. AtmosphereThe lighting, decoration and seating arrangement were all ideal. It is too bad that I did not have time to fully soak in the wonderful atmosphere as I had a pressing task at hand on that day.Overall, this was easily one of the best fine dining experience that I have had in a long time. I guess with such a wonderful set-up, it was a bit difficult for my (now) fiancee to say "Yes, I do" when I finally poped the question.Signed off: Mr G

Returned for a joint birthday dinner. Chef Matthew again delivers incredible flavours (highly recommend the tasting menu). This is a real asset to the Klapsons Boutique Hotel and a huge loss to the Wangz Brand to let such a brilliant restaurant move! The whole dining experience is always top notch, and his Mrs is lovely, friendly and will make your evening special. This is one of our favourite restaurants and "go-to" for taking friends.Another bonus for their new location is they now serve lunch
5
Had an amazing 7 course dinner for s$150. Very impressive contemporary food with a slight local twist. Each dish was exquisite. Tasted fantastic and looked amazing. The composition of the dishes and the thought process behind them were all carefully explained. Excellent service from the staff and chef Matthew who came to greet us. Shout out to Donna as well who delivered some of the best service I've ever had in Singapore. Restaurant was also very accommodating in adjusting the menu for our dietary preference (no meat for one diner). Overall was an amazing experience. Perfect for a lovely celebration without busting the budget. Would come again in a heartbeat.
5
Excellent value for lunch and dinner menu. Don't miss this. Highly recommended. Please note their new location.

This restaurant definitely wows. Amazing food and thoughtful service. Every dish was a treat, but the dessert was exceptional - finger licking good.

I was recommended to go for my anniversary by a friend.Booking was easy and Donna was very helpful to advise on dress code and to proactively advise that parking was restricted due to some work being carried out.All the staff are very friendly and greeting you by name was a nice touch. They try very hard to ensure an enjoyable visit but were not quite knowledgeable enough about the foods / menu when presenting your courses to be described as fine dining.The menu is a straight forward 5 or 7 course tasting menu and the staff are good to ask if you have any restrictions on foods you don't like or can't eat for whatever reason. I can't eat prawns and don't like caviar so they made different versions of dishes and made something completely different from the menu for me which was appreciated.Whilst the website claimed to wish to take you on a magical journey with unexpected combinations of seasonal foods, I found it to be somewhat conventional and not as inspiring or as flavourful as I had hoped or anticipated.Matthew the chef presents your dessert and creates a very attractive picture which adds to the experience and there are some nice gestures that they make when they know you are there on a special occasion, we received a complimentary drink and also they made a small cake to celebrate our anniversary.Overall I would say that the experience is pleasant without being spectacular, there is a lot of positives and potential with the staff and the approach but it just falls slightly short on the flavours and the execution.... so not quite up there on the fine dining circuit for me.We enjoyed our visit though and really appreciated the effort from the team to make our experience a special one

Was brought here, now located in klapsons Boutique Hotel, for my surprise birthday dinner. Very nice and cozy environment, decorated by art pieces drawn by Chef Matthew himself. I had the full ENSOPHI course and boy was it worth it! The OCEAN, in particular, of carabineros, scallop mousse and white fungus was worthy of any 3 Michelin-starred dish. It's as close to The Fat Duck's Sound of the Sea, minus the sound, as you can get in Singapore. Desserts were also excellent, for those with a sweet tooth. Service here was impeccable as always. Chef Matthew and his lovely wife Donna always know how to give that personal touch which elevates the dining experience to the sublime. Five stars
5
I was invited by a friend for dinner at this cosy yet charismatic restaurant that serves Singapore influenced French cuisine so to speak. The menu is inspired by "ENSOPHI" which is the philosophical footprints of Chef Mattieu, I wasn't sure what ENSOPHI entails till the adventure begun. A little skeptical, at the start, to be honest but everything just falls nicely into place as the night unfolds with extraordinary food, excellent service (especially Donna the Maitre d.) and outstanding wines. I'm not going to spoil the surprise for you therefore writing zilch on the food but please rest assured of nothing less than deliciousness. They are at the top of the game and we say : They are worth some Michelin stars if not one star at least. Good luck to the Chef and his team! I will visit again surely unless they move to Sydney

For the first time, I saw The Rabbit Stash team at SAVOUR 2016, wine tasting festival, on 11th Sep. 2016. Their dish, Nonya Laksa Penne with Tiger Prawns, was so amazing. So, I have visited The Rabbit Stash after two days for dinner.I have tasted "ENSOPHI" course.First, "Soil" was starter. It was cooked by BEURRE BLANC and garnished with caviar and iberico.Second, "Ocean", carabineros & scallop mousse & white fungus & sea asparagus, was exotic dish. It was mysterious ingredient that sea asparagus was dyed BLUE color. That' s cool.Third, "Piquancy" was lobster broth with truffle foam. Just one word is enough for describing the taste. IT'S AWESOME. It was really deep and soft.Fourth, "Exotic", baby lamb & buckwheat & mint & corn, was main dish. Actually, for me, it was not exotic than other dishes. Lamb, it doesn't need any word. Definitely, it was savory and tender. And buckwheat's texture was good and fun.Fifth, "Impression", pandan ball & teh tarik & choco bomb, was dessert. The dessert was looked as a ground of carrot farm, maybe some rabbits could play. As you know, pandan ball, it has funny texture. It made me happy.Finally, Ms. Donna Ho, the manager of the Rabbit Stash was so kind and explained every dish and ingredients. And music was quite stylish and jazzy.I recommend The Rabbit stash strongly!!

I booked a quiet table for my girlfriend's birthday. I requested a quiet table, a birthday cake and pescetarian diet. I got immediately contacted by the restaurant by sms. They confirmed my requests and clarified open questions. Upon arrival, we got a very quiet table in the corner. The restaurant staff was extremely friendly and helpful. When it came to choosing the wines, we got a knowledgeable advise on which wine will go best with our menu. We had a 7 course menu and every course was a pleasure for the palatine. Not only the taste but especially the presentation of the dishes was unique and innovative. I don't want to say too much but the dessert was the highlight of the night, Highly recommended!!

My family and I went to this restaurant after hearing that it is a concept restaurant. Their menu always has a theme. Truly, the set dinner menu has a theme and as each dish is served, there is story behind the dish. It gave us a full experience of enjoying the food and a story concept behind the dishes. Also the atmosphere is peaceful and place is decorated very homely which gave us a very cozy feeelings. The food is tasty and serve in correct proportion so that we can enjoy to the last dish. The chef and owner of the restaurant, Matthew Mok, personally "paint" a picture of dessert at the end. It round up the evening with much memories to savour. We order wine to go along with our dinner and the wines are selected to accompany the dishes. It was a very enjoyable dinner with my family. Just a note, the restaurant has moved to the new address at the Klapsons, The Boutique Hotel at 15, Hoe Chiang Road
5
They have recently moved to this new location at klapsons hotel. This time, their ambience is so cosy & romantic compared to before. Maybe it's my personal taste. I've always like a place to be more cosy than "extreme fine dine" feel. Price for food & wine are also quite reasonable now.Food is as good as I can remember! And Donna is back to being the front of house.. Thanks for the excellent service. Chef Matthew came out to say hi & started drawing our desserts! Blown us away again! We have known him for years. Definitely giving his food a 2-star from our own foodie guidebook! Kudos Chef Matthew! We will be back! :-

We were really excited about our visit to this place, after all it was rated up there with Rhubard. Lovely place, nice front of house, Donna was excellent, however the waiting staff need more training, one tried to remove our plates whilst my Fiancée was still eating..!. We were given a 7 course menu, but as the evening unfolded the dishes offered were not the ones on the menu, not all but some....we found this rather strange. The wine we requested was not available, however the recommended replacement was ok. The time between courses was far to long, so long my Fiancée and I finished two bread platters.......the food itself is well presented, but lacked depth of flavor and most of all seasoning, first time we have nearly asked for salt and pepper in a fine dining restaurant........to summarize we both came away feeling rather let down, if you really want to treat your palette, head to Rhubarb on Duxton Hill.....

 This restaurant was highly recommended to me and hence I decided to bring my client over. Food was perfect. The medium rare lamb was cooked to perfection. The lobster soup, which has a large scallop placed in the bottom middle, was flavourful too and I secretly wished for another bowl! Dessert, which was burbur hitam with vanilla ice cream and almond flakes, was not to my liking though. But that's alright, mains and dessert require different skill sets altogether. Overall I was very happy with the food. My only annoyance was that time between each dish in my 4 course lunch was approximately 30 minutes. Perhaps they were understaffed that day. Good food is indeed worth the wait, but it would be great if the waiting time is shortened as few can afford a 3 hour lunch. I will be back again.

Tonight we were celebrating our 1st anniversary so I wanted to find some place nice, friendly and with good food. After some research, I found the Rabbit Stash and decided to give it a chance... Best choice ever :)I knew I wanted to have the degustation menu so I wrote them with 2 requests: a nice and quiet table where to enjoy our anniversary and adapted degustation menu for my wife that is pregnant.The restaurant Hostess, Donna, immediately wrote me back with all the details I was requesting and few questions about my wife's pregnancy.In the restaurant, as promised, we got a quiet and comfy table. Great.The food experience was very good, exceeded my expectations and enjoyed the concept of "playing with the food" that Donna was promoting.And at the end, they brought us a 1st anniversary cake, house compliment. Very nice detai
5
Nice rooftop restaurant. Wonderful service. Nice degustation menu which is reminiscent of little titbits of the chef's life. My favourite was the ocean which as a nice Spannish prawn on the bed of a clear plastic sand. Didn't like the kangaroo so much. What was truly memorable was the piece of art the chef drew for the dessert
5
Staying in Wangz, we went to the rooftop bar for a drink. We couldn't resist a peek at the menu, and in discussion with the friendly and knowledgeable waitstaff we decided on the three course meal. In bucolic surroundings looking over the skyline of Singapore, we had a fine, fine meal.All highlights, but the intense lobster broth, the volcano (!) and the perfectly cooked lamb were outstanding. The cooking is assured, grounded and smart. Loved this friendly, sophisticated gem of a place
5
Had lunch with a friend on one of the weekdays in January. Although lunch was a 4-course prefixed menu, namely, Euphoria, the restaurant was able to change my friend's main course to a beef at the last minute.Starting with lunch, they served us snacks with was pleasing on the palate. Next came amuse bouche, which came in a really nice double-walled glass ( this wasn't even the start of our lunch!).After which we started our lunch which was a cauliflower pudding served with kale and mych more. Plating was nice and this course was rather refreshing. For the second course, we had a lobster broth, topped with a pan searced scallop, which came in a unique bowl. This is, glad to say, my favourite course of all as I love seafood.As for mains, I had the lamb, while my friend had a medium-rare tenderloin. Both mains we cooked beautifully. Well done to the kitchen!!!Finally for desserts, we had a chocolate based dessert. This was a great way to end lunch... or so we thought. To our surprise, they also served us petite fours to finish lunch. Service was great, thanks to Khai and Chandan. The amount of effort they put in to explain every little details on each plate was clear and instructive. Which means, we knew how we should eat each course in order to fully enjoy the flavors of each course.For the price of the set lunch, I would say it is worth it!I will be back for dinner to try their 7-course dinner soo
5
Beautiful restaurant which is run by people who are passionated about food. Crews which are eager to see u smile. 5 stars for their food, 5 stars for their service. Thanks guys for the awesome birthday surprise you prepared for me. My wife and I had an awesome night dinning at your place.Cheers
5
The Rabbit Stash is an exceptional restaurant, run by an exceptional husband/wife team. Matthew designs and creates the most fantastic meals with beautiful ingredients and a great deal of imagination. Donna is the perfect host and makes every diner feel special. This dynamic duo are assisted in their efforts by a great kitchen crew and front of house staff run by Chandran. A great place for a romantic meal or a party (I held my wife's 40th there), hop on over and I guarantee you will not be disappointed
4
Very good service by Chandran and team. Enjoyed 1 for 1 glasses of wine during happy hour and tried their selection of craft beer. Only one thing was that we were sitting at the alfresco area and the roof was leaking a little at certain areas. Didn't affect the seats but just a caution for those who have pet peeves of water dripping from above (like me)
5
We booked at the Rabbit Stash because of the reviews on trip advisor and we were staying at the hotel. We do not regret it. The staff took great care with us as we were severely jet lagged from our flights. We had the five course meal instead of the seven, but even so, there were three 'snacks' before hand, a sorbet between and bonbons after in addition. Plus the bread and butter. The food was inventive and tasty, and they gave my husband the lamb he wanted for his main. Every time I took a sip of my water, someone was there to top it up again, and I mean immediately! It is pricy, as in very pricy, but they gave us a 10% discount for staying in the hotel. We had a wonderful dinner and highly recommend it
4
I had lunch here yesterday, which was a four-course (plus amuse, etc. courses) fixed set. The flavours and combinations were really exceptional, and the chef and kitchen team deserve high praise in my humble opinion. The booking process was easy and they very happily accommodated a food allergy suffered by one of our group. The wine list was good but not great in terms of range and the (typically Singaporean) prices. If anything let things down a bit, which had me give a four rather than five star rating, was the service. There was nothing really wrong but great service means you never wait for a refill or anything but you hardly know the waiting team are there. In this case I felt a couple of them were pacing looking for things to attend to, rather than staying in a place with a vantage to monitor the tables. It certainly didn't impact our overall experience and I would definitely eat here again, and I'd love to try the seven-course dinner!! Enjoy.
2
Nothing wrong with the meal or the restaurant but for a meal over 500 sgd (we didn't even order wine by the bottle) we expected more. Not good value for money. There a better restaurants in Singapore at this price range
5
We came to this restaurant specifically to try the seven course tasting menu. On arrival we were given a table with a view over the skyline. The food combinations were imaginative and reflected the different food cultures of Singapore and the chefs own experiences. We thoroughly enjoyed each course and paired wines, the wines were reasonably priced. The chef-owner Matthew came out to speak with us and it was good to hear first hand about his inspiration. We really enjoyed our visit and would recommend this restaurant to locals and visitors alike. Watch out Marcus Wareing, Jason Atherton and other celebrity chefs - you have some competition
5
Excellent service , great food and beautiful scenery . Outdoor dining recommended ! Each dish are related to chef's personal life which makes it heartening . All of the staffs are very professional , especially one of them namely , Khairul . Very thoughtful and humble .
5
To start off , I would like to say that the staff of rabbit stash is amazing , the customer service was top notch with smiles never leaving their faces. ( and I mean all of them ) . A message was sent on the day of booking to confirm that we were still going to eat at the rabbit stash .However , the person that left the most impression on me was definitely a waiter called khai . I'm pretty sure all he had to do was serve the food , explain how the meal is supposed to be eaten and ask if everything was ok . However , he made effort for the whole meal (which i will go more in detail about later ) to make small short talks to make me and my other half laugh .I would like to say that this was not necessary for him to do so but he did . Honestly , at first I didn't notice him that much . But after a few dishes I realised that he was the only one who not only served , explained and asked how was the food , but he also put a smile on our faces everytime he stopped by . All the staff in rabbit stash was extremely friendly and I really did have a good experience regarding service . (Just a little more in khai as he was the only one who made extra effort to make small talks :) thanks by the way . I hope that if you ever see this , you would continue what you're doing ! You're really good at putting a smile on people's faces ! ) Next the food . So as you can see from the title . Me and my boyfriend basically went on valentines day which means it was fine dining of a 5 course meal . However , the best thing about this place is that , even though it wrote 5 course meal . They actually had hidden starters, mini appetisers/desserts and even pallete cleansers which you dont see on the main menu . Which means , you're actually paying for what you think is a 5 course meal , but getting more out of it . Since its a valentines day meal, I will not go in detail about the food as the menu changes according to season . But I would like to touch on a special desert t called bacon ice cream . Yupp you read correctly people . It's ice cream which totally taste like bacon ! Ok , I've never tried it before . Perhaps others might , but it was delicious . When I asked about it , I was told that it was the chefs creation (not the ice cream , as in the whole concoction by itself ) and that apparently in the rabbit stash , their menu is made up of the chefs own creation . Each dish was interesting and was made in such different ways.and every dish comes with a story. What actually shocked me was that the chef himself , came out to shake our hands and had a small talk with us about the food he made . (At the end , the rabbit stash gave us a flower as it was valentines day , almond cookies and a voucher for the next time we dine there . Which I would like to thank them for as like I mentioned , it's not necessary for them to do so , but keeping their service top notch , they did .) To end off I would like to say that , despite the cost , you'll definitely feel that this place is full of warmth and that the food will definitely not dissapoint you . P's. The view from the restaurant is amazing . I suggest that if the weather is fine , couples should seat outdoors and enjoy the view along with the candles that is places on your table .:)

We had an anniversary dinner at The Rabbit Stash and had a lovely time. The restaurant was quiet because it was Chinese New Year's weekend, and we had a lot attention from Chandan and his team. Service was really friendly and helpful. Good music and wine pairings. We enjoyed all the courses, but they got progressively better as the night went on. We really loved Chef's interpretation of Nasi Lemak. Before dessert was served, we had a tour of the herb garden -- nice to know many of the flavors we enjoyed came from just outdoors. Definitely recommend - especially good for special occasions
5
Booked their table at the last minute because we just have to find a nice and quiet place to discuss business. This restaurant is pretty quiet for weekday lunch. Food is good. Service staff is not intrusive. This trip of mine is complete with good memory of their tasty dishes. Lamb is amazing! It's ashamed to know that their lamb is actually from Australia. Because it's better than those I had from my home country. Thank you for making my trip worthwhile. Will surely recommend to my friends in Australia
4
I was very late for dinner and then I found The Rabbit Stash on top of the excellent Wangz hotel. Although jet-lagged, I needed little persuasion to try their Degustation menu. And I was absolutely delighted. The array of flavours was a delight from beginning to end. Presentation was beautiful. lt was art. The accompanying wines were exceptional. The grace and hospitality of the Rabbit Stash service team made for a perfect dining experience. Congratulations from me
5
My wife and I had the pleasure of dining at the rabbit stash for a birthday dinner and we both felt like we couldn't have chosen anywhere better. We were greeted by name when we arrived and that personal touch lasted throughout the course of the evening. We had a seven course degustation which gave us ample opportunity to appreciate the care and detail that went into every dish. There was nothing on the plate that hadn't been carefully considered and prepared to perfection. The staff were attentive yet not intrusive, knowledgable and fastidious. This served to make the whole occasion even more memorable. My wife was pregnant when we visited and they were more than happy to accommodate her special dietary requirements and even provided a pillow for her added comfort. After the meal, the chef, Mathew, came out and had a chat to us to see what we had enjoyed the most. I can recommend this venue highly, it will not disappoint
5
My wife and I recently won an ENSOPHI meal at The Rabbit Stash in a raffle. We weren't sure what to expect, but we came away from the meal wishing that we had known about this restaurant sooner!Let's begin with the logistics - reservations were handled clearly and professionally via email, with no concerns or hiccups whatsoever. They even asked if we had any dietary restrictions (we did), and they went out of their way to assure us that they would accommodate them. When we arrived, we were seated at an outdoor table with a lovely view of the skyline. The staff could not have been more pleasant and attentive, they were eager to help and explain all of the dishes as they were served, and were incredibly friendly, professional, and personal. They truly made the evening feel special.And the food...the food was wonderful. Unique combinations of ingredients that we would not have expected to work together did indeed work - the portions were small (it was a 5-course menu), but we left at the end of the evening feeling very satisfied. The flavors blended together well, and we loved the unique dishes and the clear thought that went into the presentation of each course. You can tell that they love what they do there, and that only adds to the experience. Our evening was capped by a visit from the chef, who stopped by to chat for a few minutes and tell us more about the restaurant. All in all, it was a wonderful evening. Great food, good wine, very attentive and personable staff, and a fun location. We'll be recommending The Rabbit Stash wholeheartedly to our friends

I'm no food connoisseur, but I've explored and tried many restaurants. It's an enjoyment for me that I'm willing to pay for. The Rabbit Stash is my first experience in food gastronomy in a 7-course setting. The menu seemed to be well thought out. Each dish has an element of surprise. However, my companion felt that the ingredients used were cheap for a $185 bill per person, which I agreed, as compared to other high tier restaurants. On the other hand, I feel that as long as the overall dish is well prepared and interesting, I do not mind. I prefer some dishes, such as "Ocean". As for other dishes with vegetables as the main component, I felt that the harmony of each ingredient isn't quite perfect. The taste of each seems to overpower one another (mostly citrus-sy sour and strong aftertaste, not sure if I'm using the right term). The portion of the entire set was just nice for a dinner, ending with a flaming dessert. Ambience wise, the restaurant is pretty small but cosy. There were many staff, service was pretty good. The view is ok (nothing much to see under the night sky, may be better during day time). Overall a unique experience.
5
Service crew is sincere and friendly, treating each guest like a VIP. Management did a fantastic job with the decor and placed bouquets of adoration around.
5
One of the most creative chefs we have encountered!
Truly a culinary journey. Every course was creative and a very interesting experience of tastes and textures. Worth every cent they charge.
5
Great service led by the team in Rabbit Stash! 'ENSOPHI' the menu created by Chef Matthew scores in both presentation & taste.
Every dish is a surprise to the tastebuds !
Recommend it to everyone.
5
The one element better than the food was the superlative service by Chandan and Aidil and team. Every effort was made to cater to making it a wonderful experience for us.
5
This was a real treat for my birthday on new year's eve arranged by my husband. From the romantic ambience on the rooftop with the city skyline as a backdrop, our excellent and knowledgeable service staff who knew our needs well to the amazing culinary masterpieces by Chef Mathew which were works of art that appealed to all our taste senses, it was truly a culinary perfection. It was the best 3 hour dinner we have had so thank you everyone and as Indians would say "vahrehvah"
5
We had the pleasure of dinning here on New Years Eve. There was a set menu, but they had a nice flexibility for eating preferences. Each course was a fun and exciting culinary adventure. We looked forward to the different flavors each plate brought, with truely artful presentation. The staff's service was spot on and made for a very memorable evening.

My husband and I like fine dining, we live in Singapore and wanted to try this restaurant.The menu is over priced for the quality of ingredients used.The dining ware look cheapVery noisy place...For this price is better to go to Joel Robuchon in Sentosa
5
Under my friend's recommendation and high rating in tripadvisor, I decided to choose The Rabbit Stash for dinner to celebrate my wife birthday. We visited the restaurant a bit early to have Happy Hour before our dinner started. Daniel, one of the server, was so professional to recommend us a suitable wine for our 7 courses dinner. On the same time, he had a very good memory on remembering my friend who visit the restaurant 2 months ago, which was so amazed for us. The food and service of the restaurant is amazing, and If you would like to choose a restaurant in Singapore for important celebration, The Rabbit Stash is one of the best choic
5
Decided to booked a table for my dinner date because The Rabbit Stash has a wonderful review on TA. Made a reservation online and few hours later - Aidil contacted me to check on any dietary restriction or special request. Wonderful service to start. When we arrived - the restaurant was not full, we were seated outdoor at the balcony/patio, romantic setting with Jazzy christmas music on the sound. It was a wonderful 7 course meals. I would say i have to agree that Rabbit Stash is listed on the Top 10 restaurant in Singapore based on TA. Chef Wok perfectly cooked all the range of combination meals. They all melted perfectly in my mouth while i paired them with the perfect red wine. We had Soil (cauliflower, Kale and kaviar), Ocean (clam, lobster cracker, etc), Impression (cuttlefish, potato, etc) and so much more. We both love all the range of the meal course and even better Chef Wok personally came and greeted us post our meals. He also presented a complimentary welcome chocolate dessert for my friend who came from Vietnam. All the staff were friendly and clearly articulating the menu and drink option. Say no more. Hands down! one of the best 7 course meals we ever had. If you are after a romantic and delicious course meals - this would be the place
5
My husband took me to Rabbit Stash for our anniversary and it was a delightful and memorable evening made special by the graceful hospitality of the staff as well as the head chef. The highlight of the evening was of course the meal (vegetarian for us) itself, which I believe was a concept food category called 'molecular gastronomy'. Every dish was unique, fun and extremely delicious. In addition to the seven-course meal, there were numerous palate cleansers which could very well compete with the main dishes. It is recommended to take a break during meal to roam the terrace which boasts of an amazing view of the Singapore skyline and the restaurant's own herbs and vegetables garden. The staff was kind and attentive and our personal host Chandan took great care of us. The chef paid us (and every other table) a visit for a chat which added to the personal touch.A must-visit restaurant in Singapore!Tip for Improvement - Avoid describing each course of the entire menu at the beginning of the meal as it takes away the surprise element. It would suffice to just mention the number of courses
5
Could not have asked for a better night out. The servers were attentive and knowledgable. Will be back next season when the menu changes up!
5
The Rabbit Stash is a hidden gem, on the roof level of the Wangz Hotel, tucked away in a corner of the largely Chinese restaurants of Tiong Bahru. The menu is fixed, and each of the many small courses (including several not on the menu) are a work of art. Each course follows a theme, including a very creative "ocean' course of seafood served on a clear tray containing sand and seashells under the food. The service is very personal and highly attentive. The restaurant, although a bit pricey, is highly recommended for special occasions
5
We were staying at The Wangz Hotel and stumbled across the rooftop restaurant. Absolutely a gem of a find - who would have thought to find a fine dining treasure like this by random. The food is pretty sensational and the service on par as well. We will definitely return to try their degustation
5
The Rabbit Stash is a great find! Beautiful food, artistically presented, with lots of extra surprises thrown in. The staff was so nice, so knowledgeable and very personable. Everything came together just right to make our party of four have a fabulous time, and the two birthday boys in our group were treated exceptionally well on their special day! We will be back

e visited the Rabbit Stash as we met Chef Matthew a a wine fair! I had no idea it was there so we thought we would give it a try! WOW! We are so glad we did as it was amazing! The thought and research that goes into each dish is beyond belief and it was as if each dish told a story. I loved the creative presentation and the detail that went into everything! The waiters were also amazing and took the time to answer questions and explain each dish in detail! The best thing ever was that they designed a 7 course vegetarian option and were very understanding of my restrictions. Would I go again? Of course, it was an unforgettable experience! Thank you

We celebrated our 30th wedding anniversary at The Rabbit Stash on the top of the Wangz Hotel after reading the reviews here on TA and what a way to celebrate our special day! The entire experience was amazing. Perusing the menu with a cocktail on the outside terrace, while soaking up the Singapore skyline was a memory that will stay with us forever. The staff were attentive and informative - even suggesting which parts of the dishes should be eaten together to achieve the best gastronomic experience. Every course was stunning to the eye and absolutely delicious. Highly recommend The Rabbit Stash for an experience you won't forget

A group of us went to Rabbit Stash for our final year end catch up and what a great place to do so. It's on top of the Wangz Hotel and we first sat outside on the rooftop to enjoy some prosecco and also the "snacks" which turned out more to be a course. They were a delicious beginning of what was to come. We went inside and began our 7 course meal. Every course from the snacks, amuse bouche's were stunningly presented to heighten all senses. The Ocean course was a top pick as was the Heritage and the main course with the venison and 72 hour cooked beef jowl was to die for.The staff were very attentive and well informed of all dished. Giving us an explanation before beginning each meal. The owners head chef Michael and general manager Donna both came and spoke to our table and we're lovely. You could clearly see Michael's passion for food. Highly recommend The Rabbit Stash. It's definitely an experience you won't forget.

The Rabbit Stash is located somewhat out of the way on top of the Wangz Hotel on Outram Road. We sat on their terrace as the sun went down, enjoying a craft beer (but less so the traffic roar from the CTE).Once inside, however, the dining experience was superb. This is a fixed tasting menu only, with optional wine pairings, so don't expect to choose your own food: fortunately the chef is brilliant and the food is immaculately presented, if a little flamboyantly. One dish was accompanied by copious smoking dry ice, I'm sure they did explain why, and the baked alaska we had as dessert was set aflame at our table as well.Don't let the presentation distract you from the quality of the food though: somewhere between 7 and 10 small snacks and courses, each illustrating a different type of flavour or sensation, all delicious and a good variety, none bland or overpowering. The chef's imagination and sense of humour was apparent not just in the presentation but also the ingredients as he played games with local dishes: how about quali nasi lemak with quinoa instead of rice? All in all, superb fare, and this place deserves to succeed. Sure, those local denizens of hungrygowhere will carp about the price, and if that's how they feel then they should go elsewhere. But for a truly outstanding culinary experience, it's worth the trip off the beaten track
5
The 7-course set menu was very creative, not only the combination of tastes, but the presentation, as well. We sat outside and enjoyed a nice view from the top of the Wangz hotel. It was a very enjoyable indulgence in food, and Chef Matthew came out and chatted with us before dessert. It was an expensive meal (> S$400 for 2 people), so definitely not something we would do very often, but made for a really special dining experience
5
We stumbled upon this restaurant by accident, as we had just checked into Wangz and was hungry!! We were pleasantly surprised by the set lunch that we were recommended. Service was good and "fast" (perhaps, because we were the only people there, by nearly 2pm). Pricing was relatively good value for money for fine dining and the taste was excellent. A place we would definitely want to return to.
4
It's a very conceptual degustation menu. One can see and taste the thoughts behind each dish. Mostly are hits, except for one or two dishes which I personally felt a little too heavy handed in seasoning. Still a very delicious and enjoyable meal. Support local!
5
This year, it has become our quarterly affair now with Rabbit Stash. This month we celebrated our birthdays here! Just want to have great food and being pampered by the ever-so-friendly and professional staff. Needless to say, they have changed their menu again. My partner wishes to have their lamb rack back. The staff said it will be back and will keep us notified by sms too. How personalised is that? With Chef Matthew's effort in putting all the ingredients together.. It is always pleasant with taste bud full of different flavours. The service staff is friendly as always. They can remember my favourite wine & tea!! (This goes to show how often we come here). Keep it up and see you guys next year. Highly recommend this place for couples & I personally think it is also good for business (to impress clients. Ha!), though my partner thinks otherwise. :)) Try it to know for yourself
5
This was a birthday dinner so was wanting a dining experience and I definitely got that. The staff was wonderful, and the food was presented as a story about Singapore, with each dish explained and the order to eat to best experience the joy of this food. OMG. Every bite was sensational and staff was attentive and ever ready to assist. Thank you to the team for a memory that will last a life time
2
for the price we paid, it did not justify the quality and portions. our wine glass was less than half full. there was some initial confusion with our chope reservations
2
we came here with high expectations given the great reviews online. the food fell short of expectations in terms of flavors and portioning. the ambience is nice and table settings is not intrusive. not sure if we will be back again
5
Service was outstanding and the staff were all very personable. It was also a very nice gesture for Chef Matthew to greet every single diner towards to end of our meal.The restaurant stands out for two things: the aesthetics of the food and the holistic culinary experience in terms of taste. Both my girlfriend and I agreed that the variety of tastes we had experienced in one dinner was amazing.While it was about $190 nett per person (after 10% discount) for the 7-course Ensophi menu plus a cocktail/wine drink per person, it was definitely a value-for-money dinner with about 6 to 7 other side pre-courses thrown in.Having been to a number of Michelin-star fine-dining restaurants, we would say that The Rabbit Stash could hold its own against these restaurants. This is why all in all, we highly recommend this place and we would definitely be back again in the near future

I'm a big fan of rooftop bars. So I was pleasantly surprised when we found out this restaurant was on top of our hotel. The food SMELLED fantastic but I was a little too cheap to eat there. If I recall it was a fixed menu for about $60-75 per person. So my wife and I had drinks $18 each and just chilled outside enjoying the view
4
The menu was well planned and executed. Each dish had little elements of surprise. We found ourselves waiting in anticipation for the next course. The place is cozy, service friendly and attentive. Had a nice time
5
Received a number of complimentary courses which were superbly delicious and creatively laid out. :) 
5
We have been recommended by our friends to try out this place. We were pleasantly surprised!! Hidden away at the rooftop of the less well known boutique Wangz Hotel. Service is wonderful! Top notch! Although not suitable for young children! (lucky we were on date night!) (^.^) Go and try! We love the food and presentation! Delicious! Chef came out to chat with us too! That's an additional perks for having the dining in such cosy outfit! Recommended

Overall we were disappointed with our experience at Rabbit Stash. The dishes are all beautifully plated however they lack flavour. All plates would have looked good on social media however all apart from the fish with chorizo lacked any depth of flavour. The staff were all friendly but for these prices there are dozens of better restaurants in Singapore. We are very unlikely to retur
3
Tasting menu is the only option. It looked decent and there were some really good dishes (the quail, for example). However a number of the dishes lacked flavour or you had to dig down to the bottom of the dish for the flavour (the fish dish with chorizo, for example). The staff try hard but however good the chef ultimately gets, the location will need to move to be able to pull in premium prices. There are plenty of other restaurants to visit in Singapore before I'd return here.
5
What a gem. A set menu to absolutely die for. Chef/Owner Matthew came out to meet punters and we were able to tell him how we absolutely adored every morsel. His wife was leading front of house staff and her knowledge of each creation was very impressive. The Singapore slings and Bintang beer we had beforehand overlooking the lights of Singapore....very special too and very romantic. Go there when you are next in town, you won't be disappointed
3
Okay tasting degustation dinner. Definitely not fine dining as described. Pretty casual atmosphere with duet singing in background. Few table settings. Above all, the service is great and manager is flexible to create 2 or 1 main course dinner
5
Amazing food,interior and service.One of the best restaurants I've visited so far.We had a very nice waiter Daniel.Really beautiful and tasty food and accompanied by a very nice interior and view
5
We recently got married at the Rabbit Stash, and the staff did a phenomenal job, from organization, to catering to service. They took care of all the details so that we could enjoy the night with minimal stress. They really went beyond the call of duty.All the guests we've talked to have had very positive things to say about the food and the staff, and we certainly plan to go back many times
4
The experience started even before I visited the restaurant. I reserved a table with a remark that I was there to celebrate a birthday. Less than an hour later, got an sms asking for the birthday boy's name :)Great ambience. Good food. Chef Mathew came out to speak to us briefly asking what we thought of the food. More unexpected was when they sang birthday song, the Chef also came out and wished Joe Happy Birthday. Thot that WA s nice touch
5
Excellent in short, nothing short of excellent. Will be back.Seasonal menu which the chef put in effort to ensure it not only taste right but also appear aesthetically nice!
5
I went to The Rabbit Stash to celebrate my boyfriend's birthday. It's has been an amazing dinner, from the sophisticated dishes to the kindness of the staff. We had a great time, and i really wish the best to the Chef, a talented young man
5
After looking for a nice restaurant for my girlfriend's birthday, I stumbled upon this up and coming restaurant with the rooftop view in the heart of Singapore. The restaurant is nicely decorated giving the dreamy ambience suited with the theme. The food quality is second to none in my opinion, and can compare to 1-2 michilin star ones. We ended the night with our minds blown away, definitely visit again when I'm bac

We just had the best dinner of the year at The Rabbit Stash restaurant. The atmosphere here was incredibly posh. Every dish was very presentable and the ingredients blended very well with each other creating a very unique taste. The service was nothing short of AWESOME!!! We can tell that they put in much effort in every little things they do =)
5
Came here due to the high ranking/rating on tripadvisor. Parking within this boutique hotel is a pain as there are only 7 lotsWe started with a drink outside first and it was nice. They now only have a 7 course dinner menu, nothing else. A few amuse bouche to start, then the 1st course of vegetables came. Looks pretty, but it's ok. the 2nd course of egg was good, and i've had it in other restaurants around the world before. Then was a bit of mixed seafood with avocado, which was also ok. the fish dish was also good, but not impressive. Finally, the 1st outstanding dish , which was the kangaroo. Wonderfully tender and cooked, it was yummy. The main of beef cheek didn't impress like the kangaroo. We were given 2 desserts and shared them - chocolate and baked alaska, both goodOverall good food with 1 outstanding dish. Service was good. The chef/owner matthew came by and chatted, which is always a nice touch, so an extra star for tha

We'd an unforgettable 7th Wed Anniversary on 17/9/2015 at this wonderful restaurant.The servants and the operating manager are very attentive and professional during the full course. Although the menu stated 7 courses but instead they served more than 7 courses and came with many surprises. Ambience is very good for special occasion for couple. Every dish presented with surprise and the ingredients too. Price is consider reasonable as compared with fine dining restaurants. Chef Mathew is young and creative! The menu will change every quarter, eager to try out his special menu and surprises! Highly recommended
5
The Rabbit Stash was chosen by my husband as a surprise Birthday Dinner and it is one of the best restaurant that i have visited in Singapore. The ambience, view , food and the staff totally made the celebration feel special. Absolutely recommend this place to everyone and do not forget to try the unique appetizers 
5
Only set devastation menu. Each dish was beautifully plated and surprised with the interesting flavours. Be ready for an unforgettable dining experience!

In case you don't know yet, you cannot eat à la carte in this restaurant. It is located in the Wangz Hotel and we had to ask for directions as we didn't see a sign to the restaurant. You can only choose between 5- (S$128++) or 7-course (S$158++) menu, no alcohol included. The food is Michelin-star-like so that was very good. However, the restaurant itself is not really nice on the inside and the rooftop bar outside was a big disappointment. A band was playing outside while the music was playing on the music system inside, so we heard both at the same time. Annoying. The service was a bit trying too much and hence not up to the quality and level of the food being served. A glass of wine is only half of what you get in other places so we mentioned that. To be fair, the waiter topped our glasses up and basically doubled our wine glass at no extra cost. Thanks! As some people eat oustide, the door went open a lot which made the experience even stranger as a bad smell was coming from outside (like a detergent or something) and with the band playing outside... So we will not go there again although the food is definitely top notch but all the rest is unfortunately of much lower quality
5
This posh romantic place was amazing! Chandan and his team knew their stuff! They accommodated our requests to sit outside first and then take dinner inside. They were flexible to bring out a cheese platter while we sipped our wine outside. And then they had all the best recommendations in which order to eat the food prepared. It was amazing! Thank you for a unforgettable evening
5
It's rare to find a restaurant that exceeds expectations in food and service. The rabbit stash has many wonderful surprises in their menu and service (every waiter remembering our names and anniversary was a nice touch). We will be back with our friends and family. This is a special plac
5
The beef jowl was first rate. Dessert was the highlight of the night. And Aidil had been most thoughtful. A wonderful meal
5
We had their 7 course special menu which we understand it's change every couple of months. Food was created with lots of thought in to it........will definitely be coming back again to be amazed by the food and the service. Made a special occasion even more special. Thanks to Chandan, Aidil and Khai for a fabulous nite!!!!!! Thanks for the hospitality.....!!!!
5
Food was wonderful. Staff were wonderful. View was wonderful. Cocktails were wonderful. What more can I say
5
One of the best meal I have ever had.
The taster menu was superb, the staff very attentive and the chef came out and greeted us after dinner.
I cannot recommend this place enough. Delightful !
5
We decided to explore the rooftop bar after eating the 鱼头炉 next door. The ambience here is nice and the waiter's service is commendable. Special thanks to Daniel and his special drinks recommendation. Good place to visit.
5
Nice ambience and great service. Great place for chilling out with friends! Love it! Special thanks to Daniel for the great service and hospitality..

Right from the first contact for reservation till last goodnight you will experience a Great customer service :-) vegetarian friendly and highly customized menu upon request.
Great taste, value for money and a memorable experience. Even welcomes last minute booking like ours.

We - my husband and I - spent our honeymoon in Malaysia and Singapore! For our last two days, we stayed at Wangz Hotel near Chinatown and realized that there was a very good restaurant in the same building... We decided to end our special journey with a special meal and booked the 7-course menu. What can I say? The evening was just perfect and by perfect I mean perfect! The food was more than excellent - creative, modern haute cuisine with a thousand pure flavors. The staff was extremely friendly and attentive! There is simply nothing that could be done better. The fact that I don't eat meat as well as that we were on our honeymoon was especially taken care of. Thank you!!
5
The food, ambience and service were delightful, in fact the best service we've experienced at a restaurant thus far! The kitchen was also very accommodating with our dietary requirements and Chef Matthew's wonderful creations are full of pleasant surprises. Big thank you for a great evening
5
After being told that we were not able to have dinner on our chosen evening, the staff went out of their way to accommodate us with a dinner tasting menu at lunch time. The waiters were friendly and attentive, they were clearly passionate and engaged about the food they were serving, giving eloquent descriptions of the concepts each dish conveyed. The food itself was a perfect marriage between eastern and western cultures, with impeccable attention to detail. Clearly a lot of thought had gone into each dish. We thoroughly enjoyed the overal experience and will rave about the meal to anyone who will listen
5
When the food is good, eating should be total submission. Just let the chef decide. I tried the seven course menu at Rabbit Stash, and I loved every course. Each was a delight to behold and taste. There were two starters (the poached egg was lovely!), two seafood courses (scallop and black cod) and two meat courses. The desert - "The sun and choconets", well, let say a picture is worth a thousand words. See more info and photos here (https://www.facebook.com/dubeersdrc/posts/866720066750481

The manager, Chandan, organised a very special birthday dinner for my Wife, including a very special dessert that I had requested off-menu. We were afforded a lot of attention during our meal and made to feel very special. I cannot thank the staff enough for a wonderful experience. P.S. The food was top notch
5
My boyfriend and I visited this restaurant last night and had a very satisfying experience. This place provides impeccable service, but most importantly, the food served was really impressive and mind-blowing. We were truly impressed by the chef's creativity, as well as the thought and effort put into each and every creation. Each of his dishes did not disappoint, scoring really high in both presentation and taste. We would strongly recommend this restaurant to anyone who is thinking of visiting a place with good food, good service and good ambience. We are pretty sure that this restaurant will give you a very enjoyable and unforgettable experience :
5
We sat outside on the balcony which offered spectacular views and a lovely light breeze - quite romantic - we even had birds chirping at one stage. Food was very tasty and imaginative - cooked to perfection. The service was very attentive - Daniel, our waiter, did a great job and was happy to chat with us about Singapore life, and the other staff were also very nice. It felt a little on the expensive side, but a great all round experience for a special occasion

Located at the roof level of the Wangz Hotel, the restaurant is an airconditioned, semi-circular area with an outside area which, on occasion, has a band and a view of the city skyline.The ambience of the restaurant interior is cosy and with casual sophistication. Modern rabbit statues adorn the "dais" area, above which is the name of the restaurant, proudly adorned. Little rabbit figurines also sit on a shelf on a wall separating the kitchen from the dining room. Designer-styled chairs and tables lends that bit of sophistication. Warm lighting adds to a casual and cosy atmosphere. With my wife, her best friend and his husband, we were a party of 4 (we were celebrating our respective wedding anniversaries) and we each chose 1 of the 2 alternate set menu. For the gents, there was the 7 course (degustation) menu and there was a 3 or 4 course menu with choices, that the ladies picked.The menu is here http://www.therabbitstash.com.sg/#!menu/galleryPageI would say that all the food in both dinner set menus were great, but the lamb rack was exceptional. The food was certainly fine dining in presentation and, in some cases, a slight nod towards deconstruction. All very accessible though.The service was however the best. Personable and warm the staff made the evening special, being very accommodating (especially with our repeated requests for their excellent home-baked onion bread!) and attentive to our needs. Always with a smile, and often with a touch of wit.Chef Matthew's elegant wife also came by our table and chatted with us for awhile. When he was less busy, Chef Matthew also came by and said 'hi'.We took our dessert in the outdoor area, partly to enjoy the view and also the 2-piece band that was Kirk & Marsha, that play there Thurs to Sats (I believe). Marsha has a great voice by the way. Lovely nuances and perfect enunciation. It was a lovely way to end a dinner party

My wife and I are staying at Wangz Hotel and just had the pleasure of a fine meal at the Rabbit Stash Restaraunt on the rooftop. When we arrived, I looked at the menu and was going to leave as I didnt know what anything was. That would have been a big mistake. The Operations Manager Chandan Rathore greeted us and also guided us through the 4 Course menu. Prior to our starters we were served several tasters, which set the standard for a fantastic flavour filled evening. By the time we were finished I had tasted food I never thought I would experience. At the end of our meal we went to the outside dining area for a coffee and to take in the amazing view. We were farewelled by the staff and the Executive Chef/Owner. I highly recommend this restaraunt
4
Had a fantastic 7 course taster menu dinner with my clients while on business in Singapore, food quality was top notch and the service was second to non. Loved the way the food was presented and the way we were involved the tastes and smells. One thing I would mention is that if you do decide on the taster menu, make sure everyone selects it, other wise the long break between courses is awkward for the non taster menu guests. Great selection of wines to compliment the food and an excellent waiter to help navigate through them. This place is pricy but a fun evening.
5
Celebrated my wedding anniversary at this restaurant last evening. From the moment I had made the reservation, the staff made sure to keep in touch with me to clarify what our dining preferences were and reminded me constantly as the date arrived. The food was wonderful! The presentations were creative and beautifully done, but more importantly, they tasted as good as they looked too! The Chef Owner (Matthew) made sure to come out to check on us when we dined to make sure that everything was going well. They also prepared a special surprise for us to top off our dining experience there. Really grateful to the team from the Rabbit Stach for the wonderful evening we had! Try them out if you are around the area
5
We had dinner tonight at the restaurant with a group of four people. We all went for the four course dinner which at $98++ was great value for the quality of food we received. Dinner started with several free little courses which was a nice bonus. Happy hour still on so we tried the signature cocktail which was fabulous. Fantastic staff and personal good-bye from chef Matthew. Great entertainment with fabulous singer which we could enjoy as we sat outside. Will go back for sure
5
Went there for my wife's birthday as a surprise with 4 other couples. Great views for drinks outside first of all followed by amazing 4-course meal with exotic snacks and perfectly attentive service. Ideal for a special occasion and good value for money for what you get

Every month or so for the past year, my wife and I have been trying French restaurants around Singapore. We visited the Rabbit Stash on Thursday night this week and we were blown away by this hidden gem. The experience started right from the reservation - I made it online through tripadvisor only hours before we were planning to dine there and within 5 mins received a call from their Operations Manager, Chandan. He had noted my comment regarding my wife's food allergies (gluten intolerant) and despite the short warning had already considered a menu specifically for her. He was extremely accommodating over the phone and was happy to entertain our request to arrive early for pre-dinner drinks. When we arrived, Chandan was there to greet us and a table outside had been reserved for our drinks, right in front of the prime view of the city skyline offered by it's roof-top location in Tiong Bahru. Back inside the main restaurant, Chandan and his staff's level of service was absolutely flawless - the type we've grown to think was available only at places you had to book months in advance for. He knew his menu inside and out and his recommendations for food and wine were right on the money. Chef Matthew (who incidentally came to meet us at the end of the night to inquire about our experience) is a genius. He mixes surprising flavors from around the world with more traditional French cuisine in some amazing creations. The unexpected palate cleansers were our favorite. Presentation was also among the best we have ever seen. The experience was far cheaper than many of our other French dining experiences in Singapore but the experience far richer. This is without doubt a must visit
5
We have heard about this place and done our research before deciding to give it a go. From the reservation onwards, the service is quite impressive. Something which you can't really find in Singapore. Tried their recommended degustation. I've to say that from the small things like snacks to the dishes they served out is a memorable journey! The staff are quite proud to say that their chef created everything from his own hand. You can expect originality here. The pricing is reasonable as oppose to what we can get in other places. Good quality food is what we were after and here we have it. Some other places although cheap but the quality of food is just not there. Quantity of food is a good size and just nice for our Asian stomach.We like to recommend for couples and for special celebration.
3
the price we paid doesn't doesn't justify the quality and portions. not that we like to complain, perhaps there are better restaurants in singapore for 50% of the price. otherwise flavors of the food and service are good.
4
Warm, cheerful welcome followed by very attentive staff.
Taking care of smallest details.
Marvelous views from the rooftop bar.
Exquisite presentation of each course in carefully and tastefully selected serving dishes.
4
I never had the four course, or five course gastronomy here. I knew this site from a few years ago as a rooftop bar, I think called Halo. I sat on the terrace, live music on a Friday night, I think it's on some other nights too, and it was very good, had some tapas (huge portions for one). Glad that I turned up during their extended "happy hour" that made it a good value good evening. Can't comment on the inside restaurant, but it looked good
4
Came here with friends to celebrate a special birthday. The staff were super attentive and made it a wonderful evening. Food was very good although not out of this world but the vibe, service and friends made this awesome. Will be back to sample the bar or menu again

My husband and I are total foodies and we have no problem throwing down big money for a fabulous meal... but when we pay and arm and a leg (approx $400 US) for an "alright" meal, it's pretty disappointing. Now, I know this is a Singapore. I know Singapore can be ridiculously expensive, but we had some some INCREDIBLE meals in Singapore for half (or less) of what we paid at Rabbit Stash. We were in Singapore last week, and I honestly can't even tell you what we ordered at Rabbit Stash. Positives: They were VERY accommodating of my gluten allergy and were able to make many of their dishes gluten free. This is a HUGE positive for me and the main reason I'm not rating our experience lower.Negatives: The food wasn't very memorable; very small portions; expensive (and not mind-blowing) wine; and our server was a bit pushy on wanting us to order multiple bottles of the most expensive wine on the menu. Multiple times, our server recommended that we should really get a bottle of the "special" wine that was not on the menu and was also the most expensive bottle. I'm ok if you recommend the special bottle once, but by the fourth or fifth time... I'm definitely not going to order it, just on principle, if nothing else.Anyway, all in all, I would say spend your money elsewhere

I experienced a mental block again after an unforgettable evening of gastronomic feast whipped up by Chef Matthew at his new hideout called the Rabbit Stash, a fine-dining restaurant bar situated right at the rooftop of Wangz hotel. The first thing that struck me at first was the rabbit candies that many of us used to eat during our childhood years. But what impressed me even more was the originality of his cuisine--a marriage of French techniques and Asian-Singaporean flavours, infused with his passion for food and the aesthetics. Full story and pics on www.dairycream.blogspot.comEvery dish looks as if they should sit in an art gallery--immaculately presented with vibrant splashes of fruit sauces and colorful vegetables. Granny Smith Apple Sauce and Beetroot Puree to go with Berkshire Pork? Or how about a umami-bursting shoyu sauce that is blended with red dates and port wine to go with the 48-hours braised beef jowls? Most importantly, the sweet influence is so evident in every course. This comes as a pleasant surprise to experience the delicate and savory flavors of the mains

Booked a table for Hubby advance birthday celebration on April . Brought kids along. Pre-ordered Food, not in menu for our 7 year old boy. Baby shared and nibbed whatever was given. ?A big Thank you for this special arrange. For me and hubby, we ordered 2 sets Ensophi..each dish came as a surprise...beautifully done, very artistic and awesome..taste...I had two gin and tonic (they called it Monkey 47) :PWell, have to sit back, relax and enjoy. Dinner took 3 hours plus. Luckily we booked a table, by the time it hit 8pm. Full house in door except outdoor . Thumbs up to all the staff esp Honey. Donna, thank you so much for making our evening a very special one. Hubby really enjoyed the dinner.Highly recommended :

Visited this restaurant at their old location before and was satisfied with the food. Now the restaurant has relocated to a hotel near Outram Park and I'm not sure why, but the food was not as good as the last time. The meat was undercooked (ordered medium to well) and the foie gras was not well cooked, almost soggy. For the price it's not worth it
5
Been to the Rabbit Stash (bar) last Friday! It was awesome!The view was superb! From where we are seated, we can see the pinnacle. The brain child of our late founding father. The lights of the buildings in CBD area was right in front of us. It was a beautiful sight. A big shoutout to the bartender - Aidil (I hope I get his name right) He make the most wicked drinks ever! You can let him know what kind of taste and liqueur you like or prefer, he will always try his best to accommodate. This kind of service is not often found in Singapore. The prices of the drinks are reasonable as well.Also, shoutout to the band - kirk and marsha.I really like their voices! They play a mixture of oldies n pop songs. Which is rare these day as many people prefer pop songs. Having a drink that is to your liking in hand, with the band playing at the background. This is the best place to chill out on a Fri/Sat night.Will definitely come back again!
5
I came here for a drink with my partner on a Friday night. You enter the rooftop and you're amazed by the beautiful view of the CBD skyscrapers.The service is impeccable and we've been taken care of Daniel, who is an amazing host, who made us want to try out the restaurant very soon. We've been living in Tiong Bahru for a while now and only now discovered this freat bar where relaxing live music is played on Thursday to Saturday. Ideal for couples, but also larger (dinner) parties can be accomodated
5
It will be hard to find the second restaurant in Singapore like Rabbit Stash. With a warm welcome and excellent services from the staff plus delicious foods, we had an amazing dinner. Thanks Rabbit Stash for such memorable moments.

This restaurant was previously at Alexandra and they now occupy the top floor of Wangz Hotel, located at Tiong Bahru. You can enjoy views of the skyline while you dine either indoors or in their alfresco area.They offer Contemporary cuisine. We tried the degustation menu to allow us to try the chef’s specialities for the day. Here are the highlights of my meal:- Bread Basket: Sliced Baguette, Cheese Bread and Onion Bread. The cheese and onion bread are nice.  - Amuse Bouche: == Deep fried lotus root slices, Trout pate on crispy bread with Onion Jam, homemade cocktail dip: The onion jam was unique and the cocktail dip is good.== Smoked Meat Balls with Rosemary: Presented in a glass plate and glass cone, which you lift up and sniff the smoky flavour. - SOIL: San Marzano, Yuzu Crystal and Basil Snow. Served on a black plate. There’s thinly-sliced dragonfruit, grilled tomatoes, whole sweet onion and yuzu sorbet. A light starter.- SOIL: Wagyu Striploin with Cerelac. The wagyu is very nice. The cerelac mash on the side is also nice. Served with mini daikon balls. The fats in the beef melts in your mouth… A must try!- PRISTINE: Oyster, Shellfish and tomato consommé with Tapioca Pearl. Served in a martini glass and the server pours the tomato consommé at your table. - HERITAGE: Fish curry, Okra and Aubergine. A modern interpretation of the local fish curry. The fish has strips of deep fried lady’s finger placed over it. The server poured the curry sauce over it. The curry was mildly sweet and reminded me a lot of McDonald’s Curry Sauce! There was a sweet jam on the side of the plate that gave contrast to the curry. Try it!- NOSTALGIA: St Louis Pork rib, with taro balls in a BBQ Sauce. A pork rib served with chewy yam balls and a grilled whole spring onion. The meat was flavourful and had a nice smoky flavour. Try it!For dessert, we had the following:- IMPRESSION: The Sun and Choconets. This was part of the ‘Universe’ on a plate. There was the ‘Sun’ (mango juice), a 3D chocolate planet ‘Saturn’ and a white chocolate ‘moon’ orbiting around Saturn. The manager later came over and said ‘I am going to destroy your planet’, and proceeded to pour hot chocolate over ‘Saturn’. The chocolate melted and revealed the chocolate pop candy within. We tucked in and its good. The pop candy gave a tingling feeling which was a nice surprise.Definitely a conversation piece and I will remember this dessert for a long time.- Composition of Guava: Served in a martini glass, it had guava jelly, cut guava fruit, crunchy bits and guava ice cream. It was interesting to have guava in different textures in each mouthful. Its nice.- Platter of Mini Dessert Trio – Cheesecake with blueberry, Dark Chocolate cake with mousse and madeleines. These were served on a platter of white and black sesame seeds. Each course was well presented and it was a feast for the eyes and the tummy.The décor of the restaurant was modern and classy, with rabbit caricatures and figurines scattered across the restaurant, including rabbit plastic lights that change colors. Why all the rabbits? I asked the chef (Chef Matthew) who came round the tables to greet customers and he said he’s born in the year of the Rabbit! He is down to earth and approachable. I am sure he can customise menu to suit your dietary preferences.I liked the creativity of the chef to craft dishes that fit into his cooking philosophy and continually surprise his diners with new dishes. It was a good dining experience. Recommended

As we were not very hungry after our flight from France,we had only a three courses menu after a good mise-en-bouche:the pan-seared foie gras was perfectly cooked as the confit of morning catch and the lamb rack. My Valrhona chocolate dessert was also great! Congratulations to the young chef! Friendly service

I haven't reviewed anywhere for months, but had to come out of retirement to write a glowing review for this place.Small and intimate, and the food was just superb. It's not for your hearty meat and two veg types, as the courses are small and the flavours delicate, but this was one of the best meals I've had in Singapore. Check out the menu before you book to make sure it's for you, but if it is, you're in for a treat.Service excellent, possibly a shade on the over-attentive side, but hard to find fault. A lovely evening and a great meal - I will be back, and soon

My husband and I are currently staying at Wangz Hotel where the rabbit stash is on the top floor.Being our wedding anniversary, we decided to treat ourselves. My husband and I seldom visit up market restaurants both in the UK where were from and in Australia where we now live. We were slightly intimidated when we walked in...quite frankly we couldn't work the menu out but our waiter explained it to us and it's easy to understand once they do.We ordered a four course menu at s$90 pp. the most we've ever spent on a meal before, but hey, when in Rome.There are lots of little extras like delightful warm, fresh bread and then a pallet cleanser comes out. The mustard sauce and the two bite size pieces of meat told me we were onto something special. The dishes then came out thick and fast afterwards. With every dish, the manager comes over and explains what each item on the plate is and how it is to be eaten. For two uneducated foodies like my husband and I, his input was welcomed. The service in the restaurant is impeccable. Our glasses were never dry, our plates were never emptied. Some foodie consiours may find the information on each dish a tad intrusive, but different cultures welcome these things differently. I for one welcomed what I viewed to be excellent service.To finish the evening, the staff presented us with a small dessert, candle and well wishes for our wedding anniversary. Such a small touch finished our night perfectly. Matthew, the chef and owner then came to us and asked us how we found our meal and our experience at the restaurant. We did not hold back in telling him his restaurant is possibly the best restaurant we have ever been too. His food, service and ambience are an absolute delight and if we have any money left before we leave, we shall be back

Wow I just had a splendid solemnization ceremony at Rabbit Stash, Wangz Hotel! All thanks to Chef Matthew, Donna, Chandra and their team for doing such a fantastic job and has great service provided from start till the very end! I am glad to have restaurant lady boss Donna to have taken care of many issues and queries always!This is definitely a lovely place to hold solemnization as it has both indoor and outdoor space with the beautiful flower arch by . All our guests were full of praise for both venue outlook, outdoor scenery and food, especially the pork belly and herb rice which the guests love!I have been to Rabbit Stash at night too and it has a captivating night scenery view. I will strongly recommend this place for romantic dates, parties, solemnization/weddings, chill-out spot as they also have live band every Thurs, Fri and Sat nights!A big thank to Rabbit Stash and all team members

Decided to try RS after seeing so many rave reviews, and was not disappointed. From the service, the ambience, the drinks and most of all the food, everything was befitting of the fine dining experience that the staff and chef are trying to create, and everything is well thought through. Dined on the lovely terrace with views overlooking the city, and were delighted with the creativity of dishes served up by Chef Matthew and his team. For below $150 (just) for degustation menu this represents great value, compared to other similar offerings in Singapore, and I highly recommend you give this place a try, you won't regret it

Based purely on TripAdvisor reviews, my wife and I celebrated an anniversary at this fabulous restaurant. The waiting staff are all very friendly, efficient and know their chef's cuisine. They clearly see their role than more than just taking a food order, and then delivering the food to the table (as opposed to many other restaurants in Singapore). Rather, they are part & parcel of the customer's experience. Food-wise, I can clearly see why Chef has had some exceptionally good reviews. The food is inventive, themed presentation is innovative (without being kitschy) and most of all, delicious. The addition of several 'surprise' dishes was an extra nice touch. The food menu offers a wide selection, and for Singapore, is very reasonably priced. The wine menu also offers a decent selection, and offers some very nice but smaller labels from around the world. Overall, one of the best dining experiences in Singapore in recent times. As I am sure that we will see a lot more of this young chef in years to come, I'd really encourage visiting the restaurant now .... before the restaurant is inevitably relocated to somewhere like Marina Bay Sands and resultant huge price hike.

Judging by the accolades and previous reviews, we know the chef's / and his kitchen's talents definitely meets the mark but as everyone knows the service is an equally critical component in making any dining experience a great one. As everyone also knows, the quality of an establishment's service is truly tested in how it chooses to react to the unexpected - and so it was with the Rabbit Stash today.My wife and I turned up at the establishment after lunch service (fairly late after lunch anyway but way before the evening shift) seeking just cocktails (because we can) on a monday. It was pretty obvious to us that the place was closed and they could have turned us away - and we would have understood. What happened instead was unexpected - we were shown seats at the (deserted) rooftop bar, the waiter turned on the fans and took our orders. He explained that the bartender was away but he'd be happy to put together a limited selection - and we duly obliged with our order (a Singapore Sling and a Tom Collins). What transpired was a due of cool resfreshing drinks - which we appreciated more because someone had clearly made the effort to make us welcome. My very sincere thanks

we went there for dinner with a group of 3. centrally located at tiong bahru we decided to try something different. berkshire pork is good service can be improved.
5
An awesome dining experience!Every dish is carefully thought through and we love them all! The presentation, quality and service staff are commendable.
4
Assiduous staff guided you through the set menus. Distinctive and beautifully prepared. However, when you have chosen your food, having every clearly visible ingredient described to you when the course arrives as a bit tedious. Wine list good.
5
Great ambiance paired with unique food and experience.
Excellent service provided by the crew, giving diners a personal "butler" feel.
Thumbs up to Chef Michael and his team!

How good it is when you can leave a restaurant full of praise for the experience & not be concerned about the cost. In Singapore for a holiday with my wife & booked The Rabbit Stash based on some reviews I read & hoping I got it right. The moment we walked in the ambiance & wait staff told me this should be ok. The degustation menu told us it could be better than ok. But once the food was being served we knew it had the potential to be something special. And we weren't let down. The imagination, creativity & flavours delivered by the chef were exceptional. A must visit if you enjoy more than the routine meal & appreciate quality food prepared by quality chef. Can't wait to visit again to eat here again.

After reading some positive reviews online, we decided to have our wedding anniversary dinner at The Rabbit Stash. The restaurant is cozy and intimate. Initially, we were apprehensive to chose the degustation menu (7-course) as we are not big eaters but the server assured us the portions would be just right. While waiting for the courses to be served, we were presented with a basket of warm, toasty baguette and focaccia that I couldn't stop eating. After tasting the bread, I knew our dinner would be a delectable one. Not only could we taste the freshness of the ingredients, chef/owner Matthew also took great length in making sure each course was aesthetically well presented. It was a feast for our eyes and palette. The service staff were friendly and attentive. Indeed the meal portion was just right for us - full but not overly stuffed. We were told they would change their menu every season (3 months), we are looking forward to our next visit

Revisited here after 12 months last night and in thier new premises,whch have some challenges.Concept is awesome but a bit too much molecular gastronomy for me, but one dish was superb......... Scallop number with prawn,salmon, anchovies crisps & on banana sauce with the flavour combinations exceptional. See below. Mushroom bisque and pork belly and beef cheek also pretty good!!Ambience would help with tables rearrangement and less staff, some food served hotter, Donna as permanent front of house and revised wine list includng Autralian wines but an awesome potential!Recommend to stick with it as will be well worth the effort

We decided to stay in the wangz hotel for a weekend break. After reading about the rabbit stash (on top of the wangz hotel) and looking at the menu we decided to give it a try. And what a great choice it was. The location is great with nice views, the staff very at tentative and the food sublime . The chef came out to have a conversation with us which is alwsys nice. They (all the staff) are very proud of the menu and they should. Next time we will vist them again
5
The staff were patient and attentive to our needs. There was sincereity in the way they took the time to explain the food to us. They added a personal touch to the feel of place . What is equally important was the food. it was exquisitely sumptuous. every course of the meal was awesomely good especially the Berkshire pig and Murray bridge lamb rack are to die for. The staff, the Operation Manager and their service elevated our first experience here. We will be back here definitely. Looking for a romantic dinner, this is one to experience
5
A cool and chill roof top bar and friendly heart warming staff to top it off. The Berkshire pork is an absolute must have. Fusion of roasted pork w beetroot coloured savory potato mash. The pork skin is thick and crispy, and the meat has the ample marbling. A must try
4
Had the privilege of cocktails & bar food at Rabbit Stash last week. The Balsamic Chicken Winglets were scrumptious! Drinks were as expected and service was very attentive. The live music was relaxing but not overpowering. Will go back!
5
Booked a table for lunch. warmly greeted by the staff upon arrival. the 1st pleasant surprise was that the operations manager, Mr Chandon took the trouble to find a cushion for my back - seeing that I am pregnant. simply thoughtful!from the appetizer to the main course, we are thoroughly spoiled by their impeccable service and the food. 2 thumbs upit's a place highly recommended for service and food!will certainly be back there again
5
Staying at the great & quirky Wangz hotel & wandered up to the rooftop to find The Rabbit Stack. Booked in for dinner & had one of the most memorable degustation meals ever! The staff were attentive & knowledgable & the food was sublime. Highly recommended
5
Booked for a Romantic dinner whilst visiting Singapore. Warmly greeted by staff on arrival, Had the 7 course Degistation, enjoyed a lovely culinary experience. Staff were knowledgeable and guided us well. Textures and Flavors were exceptional both intense and delicate. Notable, Beetroot sorbet, Parsnip snow, purity of shellfish, beef cheek. Chef Matthew is truly gifted.
5
Went out on a Tuesday night as part of our anniversary celebration tour. Took advantage of the 7 course degustation to fully experience what this restaurant has to offer. Fantastic flavours and textures as the chef/owner dabbles in some molecular cooking - beetroot sponge freeze dried for crunch, parsnip snow that melts in your mouth. Every plate was a visual and flavour experience. Tues in Singapore is a quiet night which meant we were spoilt for service - nothing was too much trouble. As a treat we recieced a rosewater toffee swan (delicate and stunning) to celebrate our anniversary. Recommed the full degustation and a drink on the roof bar if the weather is good

My boyfriend and I chose RS for our first Valentine's day dinner. I was excited,having heard its excellent food it serves. Indeed, food was exemplary, a pleasure to the sight and taste buds. The chef definitely paid great attention to details and creativity. The ambience in this hidden gem is surreal,given the fact that it is surrounded by shophouses and old coffeeshops. The standard of service however leaves much to be desired. Upon arrival, we were neither greeted nor ushered to our table. It may understandably be a busy night,but a female staff was idling right beside us. I expected a main waiter to explain that only a V-day special set dinner will be served, following a menu But non was done until requested. Poor consistency in service. Some dishes were explained, some were not. cutlery arrangement were poor. at one point, I had 2 main course knives. At another, my partner had no spoon. looking on to other tables, sometimes the ladies were served second. My boyfriend made an arrangment with the staff, requesting for a bouquet of flowers. at the end of the night, i was presented with 12 stalks of bare withering roses with thorns and leaves still on like they were plucked off the bush. It seemed to me like there were mostly temp staff on their first day of job with zero experince. To be fair, i once waited on table too. However, the 2 knives-no-spoons example and greeting a customer require no prior experiEnce. I recommend this bunch of new employees be retrained.

My Husband and I dine here on the 25th February. The service staffs were attentive and were able to explain each course in detail. As I am a light eater, i requested for a 3 course meal instead of the 4/5 course dinner, which the restaurant glady accomodated. We ordered the foie gras and scallop as starters, wagyu striploin for the main, and symphony of chocolate and the butterscotch lava cake for desert. The food was excellent and well prepared
1
My husband and I dined here on Valentines Day evening and despite the person I liaised with over email being helpful when I explained I was pregnant and a pescatorian this level of service ended there.We arrived early and had a drink outside but were disappointed with the limited drinks menu and the lack of non alcoholic drink options, they didn't even have coke light! We were shown to our table and things went downhill rapidly:- We were not giving our complimentary drinks until we asked for them- at no point were we asked if we'd like another drink throughout the meal- For my second course I was served a prawn, scallop and smoked salmon course despite having reminded them of my dietary requirements, when we complained they took away the plate and just took off the the scallop and prawn and brought it back, when we complained again they told me chef would cook me fish then 5mins later I was brought the same initial plate with salmon, half a boiled egg and a potato rosti which on further exploration had bacon underneath! This time we complained to the maître d who said he'd ask the chef to come any speak with us and apologise, the chef never came.- The maître d also barged past me whilst I was on my way to the toilet which was very rude.- the final course of beef & salmon came on a shared plate which is not good for a non-meat eater- a green tea we ordered never arrived- we had to ask several times for cutleryThis was a very poor dining experience and we wouldn't recommend to anyone

My wife and I celebrated our Valentine's Day at The Rabbit Stash. We chose this restaurant due to its rave reviews. We were not too impressed with our dining experience. Prior to the dinner, I received 2 calls from the restaurant requesting that we vacate the table by 8.30pm for its second seating. I understand that most restaurants will be very busy on Valentine's evening, but the seating arrangement should be communicated to the diners during or before the reservation. I think it is totally not appropriate to request their diners to limit their dining experience when the restaurant is over-booked. We arrived at the restaurant to discover that it was only serving a Valentine's Day set menu. We were not informed about this. Neither the staff who took our reservation, the staff who reminded us of our reservation nor its restaurant website informed us about the change in serving menu. In addition, the price of its only offering was not stated on its menu or was communicated to us by any waiting staff. At that moment, we did not want to dampen our celebratory mood and went ahead with the dinner. We ordered sparkling water and red wine to go with our dinner. The foods were reasonably good, but the waiting staffs were again quite disappointing. The 7-course menu was served in the correct order, but dining details, like the cutlery arrangement etc, were simply not up to finest level. Our final bill did not include our dinner price. If we were dishonest, we would have walked off without paying for the dinner. The Rabbit Stash will need to improve on their service standard in order to justify its rave reviews

We loved this place. It's rare that we score 5 and restaurants that gain this score from us need something that "wows". At the Rabbit Stash it was the food and service.The food was outstanding especially for the price which at S$270 for two was amazing value given the quality of the food and included 3 or 4 drinks each. The menu was fixed price four ($90++) or five courses offerings. There are lot's of extra small tasters given. If you have small appetite that might sound a lot. However, the smaller size portions mean that you end your meal highly satisfied having tasted a wide selection of brilliantly prepared dishes. The service was superb, not intrusive but always on hand to guide and explain the dishes - which they understood well. The restaurant area and rooftop bar are very comfortable with great views towards CBD and surrounding areas. Now to the picky points of which none spoiled our experience but might annoy others. - The restaurant was very quiet on the Wednesday night we attended. We were told Thurs, Fri and Saturday are their busy nights but this place deserves to be busier on these quiet nights. - The menu is a little confusing when first reading and it's not until you receive an explanation from the great team that you understand how it works. - One dish from each section: starter; main; and desert was not available and given RS is opposite Tiong Bahru's great food market, that's not really acceptable. In summary, a very enjoyable evening with an outstanding food and service experience. We will be back
4
Excellent service with the waiter explaining all the different courses. Choice of 2 starters or 2 desserts from 4 options. Small portions and pricey but worth a special occasion. Interesting view over the city with Chinatown and downtown all illuminated at night
5
We stayed at Wangz hotel (itself very good) and ate here on our last evening before heading for the airport. The staff were friendly and knowledgeable and the food excellent value for money
5
A huge thank you to Matthew, Donna, Chandan, Daniel and the team at the Rabbit Stash for a memorable 40th Birthday celebration. I was impressed by their excellent customer service and attention to detail from the moment I made the booking for a party of 10 people. The dinner presentation was amazing and the creativity and flavours of the menu a delight. The rooftop terrace was a great way to end the evening with views over Singapore. Highly recommended. Be sure to visit soon!

This restaurant moved into a new space at the end of 2014. They are led by an ambitious owner chef that drives the creativity in the kitchen and has great ideas to make nice fine dining food at competitive cost.The kitchen is trying hard, although I do not think it is really in the top 100 in Singapore. The issues are in the service. We had a fairly big group and food was always late. I basically finished my food when they announced what it was. A lot of my guest complained the food was cold and service slow. Hope they will improve, but service is really an issue in Singapore the last couple of years.Toilet is a bit of a joke if you want to play in the top end of the market
5
Looking for a quiet night out we ate here midweek, we were impressed by the quality of the food, and the attentiveness of the staff. The menu was well thought out with a great combination of flavours and textures. We’ll certainly return next time we are in Singapore
5
Went there recently to celebrate the new year with my fiancee Jaslyn, without knowing anything about the restaurant. Turns out that they relocated to this venue only 2 weeks ago. There were a few teething problems - for example the menus we were given were slightly different from the other (one menu was updated, the other not), waiting time was a little long before we managed to catch the attention of the busy waiters to take our orders, and we were seated before the table was set - and to be honest, I was a bit taken aback at the high price point of the menu (but this was entirely my fault because I wasn't prepared for coming to a fine dining restaurant like they are). But these were all minor teething problems which were more than compensated for by the excellent friendly service of the operations manager, the staff and the chef Matthew himself. They introduced the dishes as they came and offered us additional welcome drinks and bread (these were free of charge, of course). I was also pleasantly surprised that my 4 course dinner set was actually a 6 course set - there were 2 more appetizers included in the menu - and that made my expenditure seem much more worth it.Not one to be fussy about service or ambience, however, what will make me come back is the food. For the appetizer, I found the scallops - salted, grilled/seared to perfection - to be the best I ever had. Out of the 4 choices, i would rank the scallop dish first, followed by the foie gras, beet root, and egg (maybe I am influenced by the value of the dish? ;p). Regardless, all were very nice. For the mains, I upgraded to the tenderloin while my fiancee had the pork. Our opinion was more mixed - i preferred the tenderloin while she preferred the pork, over the other. Suffice to say, she was raving over the pork while I, the beef. :)For its price, some dishes met expectations, while some exceeded expectations. Will definitely be back. Keep up the good work chef

During our short trip in singapore we had a dinner at Rabbit Stash.Service was very good - excellent.We tasted all chef suggestions and we had a good dinner experience. Thank you again for a lovely night
5
Went to The Rabbit Stash for dinner to celebrate my fiancee's birthday. The service was excellent as they were hospitable and we felt welcomed throughout. They staff were also willing to explain the types of dishes to us and even offered to help us take photos.The chef and staff gave my fiancee an inpromt-tu surprise cake when they came to know that it was her birthday.The restaurant overlooks outrum road's scenic view. Ambiance and the music sent us into a relaxed state.Most importantly, the food was unique to us but tasted delicious. However, we felt that it was slightly pricey. But nonetheless, we will still visit The Rabbit Stash again
5
Rabbit Stash is one of my favourite restaurants for good food and service. The ambience is great and the food- Wow! The menu changes every month or so and I'm always amazed with the different menu Chef Mathew comes up each time. The food is excellent. I especially love the foie gras which is always done to perfection.Their cream brûlée is one of the best I have ever eaten. A great place to come for a meal with family and friends
5
4th visit to this restaurant and it's always a great experience. The new location has a nice relaxing atmosphere, service is excellent and the food is always great no matter what we choose to eat. Chef Matthew keeps coming up with great new dishes and we always look forward to coming here. A must come for a nice relaxed dinner with family or friend
5
Its my first time being here and I wasnt disappointed with the food and service. Its new year eve thus I believe a special menu was created and the food was fabulous but i guess you have to try it yourself to know it. Great job to Chef Matthew and team!
5
The food was just delicious(!), the plating exquisite and beautiful, the service friendly, attentive and personal. We had great views, and from where we sat, we could see Chef's team at work in the kitchen. No compromises! For starters, the Composition of Winter vegetables was art on a plate, the tastes and textures subtle and pleasing. Sakura Chicken was chicken at its best, moist, tender, flavorful with crispy skin. The main of Mayura Wagyu Beef was done to a prefect medium rare, the Bordelaise sauce that came with it was rich, deep, and earthy. It was like strolling through a woodland brimming with mushrooms. Normally, I am not keen on desserts, but the Butterscotch Lava was an clever combination of textures and flavors, and not overwhelmingly sweet. Beautifully done. Overall, bliss.....
5
This is yet another time i've visited rabbit stash after so long. Chef Matthew has again achieved beyond my expectations in terms of his food creation (they have more snacks now). For a local chef, I personally think that he has the quality to be under the radar of michelin star. If only michelin star judges come to Singapore! :)) I still love their beef.They're opened not too long ago.. Heard from the staff that they have not do a launch of this new location! I'm lucky to be the first few to get this reservation. With this new outlook of theirs located at the rooftop of Wangz Hotel and such a pleasant view of singapore skyline.. im sure gonna bring my friends back again!! Now they have wine bar and cocktails in their menu! Yay!Didn't get to see the lady boss, Donna, around. Although her presence will make my entire experience complete. :)) Keep it up rabbit stash team! Its definitely worth another visit! I'll be back with more friends

Third visit to this restaurant but first since they moved to this new location on the roof level of a boutique hotel  Whilst the previous place exude a homey feel , this new location comes off a decidedly more fine dining like . But what it lost in its intimacy is made up by the great service led by the manager Chanan who was attentive and professional without being pompous or too officious . Chef owner Matthew is probably one of the best local young chef and all six of dishes in the Christmas degustation menu was close to perfection. The artistic presentation of the dishes adds a nice touch but as rightly so, just serves to accentuate the skill of the chef in planning and cooking a most complete and supremely delicious meal. Worth many more visits for sure
4
Food is always great wherever they are located. New place is nicely decorated with nice outdoor drinking area to chill. Parking is limited but alternative parking on the left (before turning in to the hotel carpark) is available. Staffs are friendly and proprietors very welcoming
5
Went with 5 other friends and my husband for dinner. All of us enjoyed the 3 course dinner that we chose. We had pan seared fois gras, pan seared scallops and soup for appetizers and everyone was very happy. Main course we had lamb rack, tenderloin, beef cheeks and pork. All was done very well too. For desserts we had pandan creme brûlée, poached pears and we were given a complimentary durian creme brûlée as it was one of our birthday. It was fantastic and taste exactly like real durian. Will definitely visit them in their new place when they reopen in sep/oct.
5
Visited with our daughter last night,lovely restaurant,staff were very friendly and welcoming,great atmosphere.the food was amazing,my fish main was yummy.will visit again
5
The Rabbit Stash albeit a little hard to locate, upon reservation, a follow up message was sent that contained directions as to how to locate the restaurant in the building.I came here with a friend to celebrate her birthday. The staff greeted us with a very genuine and warm service attitude, coupled with a cosy ambience, the place made me feel like home. Food is awesome, I had the:Lobster broth, ribeye steak, and mango mascarpone,while my friend had the:Foie gras, beef cheek, and fondant.Donna, the head chef's wife helped us with the choice of wine to complement the beef we were having and I totally enjoyed the synergy. Absolutely love this place and would most definitely come back again soon
4
cosy and warm restaurant, food is good, my favourite dish is still steak :). convience to walk around from this place. NICE
5
We visited last night when staying with friends in SQ. We had a special degaustation which included a main meal which was huge. The steak was perfectly cooked, when ordered rare not blue!The stand outs of the 8 courses were the Lobster Bisque, the best I have had, and the 48 hr braised Pork Belly which was indescribable and stunning. The ambience and service friendly and it was good to find such a hidden gem.Chris Bisho
5
I booked The Rabbit Stash as a surprise for my husbands birthday and we had a lovely meal. The service is brilliant - very attentive and friendly and the quality of the food excellent.My husband opted for the 7 course degustation menu, while I chose the 5 course menu. Every course from both menus was perfect - we loved everything. I would describe the food as European, with an Asian twist. At the end of the meal they surprised my husband with a birthday dessert - a lovely touch.I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this restaurant and we will definitely be visiting again with our friends. Thank you Donna and co for a great evening
5
No extra decorative on the plate, everything are edible , ya everything are just done perfectly including their complimentary lavender honey drinks ......Food 110% satisfied Service 120% satisfie
4
We were here for the valentine's day menu. And we were impressed with the service and food tasting. Donna and crew is attentive and sincere. It was full that evening, we got a table thirty minutes after our reservation time, so I taken off a star for we were quite hungry already by 9.This is a place where you can have a dinner date or business dinner. I definitely recommend a visit here for the food
5
I took my girlfriend here for her birthday. They were prompt and very friendly during the reservation, and even advised me on the seating arrangement, as I wanted to surprise her with a birthday cake. On the day of the lunch, they even closed the rest of the restaurant, so we were the only people for the duration of the lunch. I've never had such amazing service. And the food was amazing, served at the perfect pace so it never felt rushed and gave us enough time to appreciate each fantastic dish. I would absolutely recommend this place and would come back again.
4
No run of the mill food here. Everything is made from scratch. I'm always craving for their lime sorbet but it is always in the late afternoon and they are close. The owners are amazing, friendly and accommodating. Always a great time when we are there
5
We were a group of 10 people with two vegitarians. Both Matt and Donna were very accomodating. Everyone enjoyed the great night of fine cuisine. The food, the wine list, the presentation and the service was excellent! I strongly recommend The Rabbit Stash if you are looking for a quality price for a group dinner in a coasy environment

Walked into a surprise 50th last night at Rabbit Stash. Had a fantastic evening. Restuarant is cosy, probably maximum guests around 20. Kitchen open. Staff are the owners and are really friendly - went out of their way to make it special. The food was great - we did the 5 course degustation. Favorites we scallops, steak and chocolate fondant. With wine around $100 a head, but worth it

my friends and i love trying new places and cuisines. came across The Rabbit Stash and decided to check it out. Good choice. We went for lunch on a wednesday afternoon, had the entire restaurant to ourselves - just the three of us. Donna is simply superb. Wonderful food..kudos to chef matthew. We tried the different set lunches.. the desserts were yummy, had a great wine which she recommended. When we mentioned that it was our friend's belated birthday, she even gave us a candle on a dessert .. totally unexpected, but just so cool. great food, great company and great ambience. great place to have a party .. you could have the entire restaurant to yourselves

We held a wine dinner last Friday night for a visiting Australian winemaker and chose The Rabbit Stash due to our excellent dining experience when we'd visited the restaurant previously and the care, thoughtfulness and friendliness displayed by Donna and her team. She and chef Matthew were just back from Copenhagen, as they'd been chosen to represent Singapore in a culinary event there.We had a nine course degustation menu, some lovely surprises added to it to tempt our palates further. Catering for a couple of non-meat eaters (fish OK) and a vegetarian (neither fish nor meat OK) was no problem and everyone was delighted with their meal. The food is innovative, but very approachable, often with a stunning combination of interesting flavours. Pairing with the wine was fantastic. The ambience on the night was great too.We're going back tonight with gourmet friends from Australia to repeat the experience

Every dish was cooked to a high level of excellence. Notable mentions were the tenderloin, lamb rack, foie gras, and mixed vegetable icecream. We loved the wholesome experience of the 9 course degustation menu - everything from the flavours to the plating and service!

We went there to celebrate my husband's birthday as I wanted to stay away from all the crowds esp over the weekend. I briefly mentioned to the staff upon reservation but they remembered and concocted a happy birthday cake for my husband. A pleasant surprise. The new premise has a warm cozy setting. We had the recommended set and food was fresh and tasty, very prompt service and attention. As I sat at the table nearest to kitchen I could watch the chef in action. Love their steaks, home made passionfruit sauce and home made sherbet. Spent about $80 each for 5 course dinner and red wine

I tried to make a reservation at Rabbit Stash for my friend's birthday treat via the website. Donna, the owner replied me promptly via sms and email to explain that the restaurant would be closed as the team was not in town. I thought the service was really personal. I made another reservation on an alternative date instead and got a reply instantly. Prior to our lunch at the restaurant, Donna advised me on how to get there and parking via sms in case I drive. (Really great service.)The food by chef Matthew was fantastic. We had the set lunch and as pork was not available, we were offered ribeye instead. During the meal, Donna and her staff ensured that everything was fine and comfortable for both of us. Towards the end, my friend had a nice little surprise from Donna as it was her birthday. It was certainly a great and personal experience to dine at Rabbit Stash and I would definitely return again

This is my second visit to The Rabbit Stash, the first in the new premises. I have to say I was again very impressed. The experience was fine dining in a very intimate but comfortable environment. Matthew is clearly passionate about his food and this translates into the dishes he serves. Every dish from the five course menu was delicious. The portions are not huge but overall, after 5 divine courses I felt very comfortably full. I would highly recommend giving this place a try as I don't think you will be disappointed

I have been once to the Rabbit Stash to celebrate my friend's birthday last year. It had left me with a deep impression. I felt the food was cooked by a chef who would not compromise quality for his dishes. With that memory, I brought another friend to try the new menu. With the haze problem, I have not been enjoying any of my meals. I felt like I ate just to live. From the first dish to the last, my tastebuds were just slowly waking up to each dish. I know this sounds crazy but for once I felt alive in this depressive environment of smog and constant worry for health. So I am thankful to Chef Matthew for reminding me that food that is cooked with much love and attention can be a source of healing as well. As for my friend, I can see how happy she was with each course. All I wanted to do was to share with her a dining experience that is about a heart-felt dialogue between the chef and the customer. Thank you, Donna and Honey for being so attentive and thoughtful to our dining needs! I enjoyed the casual conversation we had in between our courses. Even though my friend came in very casual attire (my fault for not warning her), you all did not make her feel out of place at all like what other fine dining places would have done. I am impressed with the way you have explained to her and gave her the warmest welcome despite everything. You have won my respect! Thank you for giving me hope about good service in the F&B world. I shall be back to taste more of your creative menu! Anne Chua :)22.6.201

This place serves up some superb food. I love the way Matthew put in his heart into every dishes that came out of his kitchen. I also love the way how attentive & genuine Donna is. This couple makes you feel at home. Any one who wish to dine there has to ditch away any form of expectation as would dine in any restaurant. I did went in with an open mind. Thats why i found this place a gem. Good food & good service. Can't ask for more

Having heard rave reviews about The Rabbit Stash from friends who had dined in when the restaurant was at Pandan valley before it shifted to its present location. I went with high expectations, and I am quite impressed and pleased. I went with two friends and we were greeted warmly when we entered the restaurant.The ambience was cosy with soft music playing in the background. We ordered 5 course degustation and food was served to us pretty quickly despite a full house.Each course was given a detailed introduction by Donna after it was served, it is hard to get that kind of service and attentiveness nowadays. What impressed us most, was Chef Matthew who had prepared our meals, came out and mingled with us.The food is good, coupled with attentiveness is hard to find nowadays! Go try and you will be pleased

We were there on a Saturday evening. Everything was fine until they mixed up the orders. For the 4 of us we had 3 different degustation meals, 5 , 7 and 10 course. And we waited and we waited and we waited and they did not even offer us anything to munch while they prepared our dish, until I asked Donna about it, then she obliged with a shooter of lobster bisque. By then, between the 1st course and the 2nd course we waited for close to an hour. Eventually it took us 3 hours to complete our meal. They need to know how to learn how to manage their customer expectations.The taste of the food was quite good however the ribeye steak I had could be of better quality as it was stringy. The dessert was not up to standard, even the tiramisu which was supposed to be good.It was a disappointing meal for me. It could be better

This is a small, charming, chic and friendly restaurant in a slightly unlikely location. I happen to live in the condo above it though, so it works out well for me.Donna and Matthew are lovely, genuine hosts who care about presentation and love good food. Their passion for it is infectious and we go back every few months to sample the next season's menu.Yes, the food isn't cheap, but you really do get what you pay for and each course is explained to you as it is brought to the table, which brings the dishes to life. The flavour combinations are incredible and each dish looks beautiful. Even though the dishes are fairly small (the whole idea behind a degustation menu), we've never gone home hungry, even after just 5 courses. That's the beauty of a well-balanced, nutritious menu!You can also order a la carte at lunchtime if you want a sneak peak at the quality without going for the set menus. Try it - you won't be disappointed

This is a tiny restaurant, offering tiny portions for a big price. Without any doubts the restaurant is trying very hard to play in the top league... i haven't been really convinced though. The interior is very average- a long room with tables & chairs. To me there's nothing cosy or charming about it. The food is good. The service very good... but not worth paying more than 100 SGD for two people
