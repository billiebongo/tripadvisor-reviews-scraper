Our tour guide ordered for us. I got the seafood dish, my husband got the plain. I don't know what the dish really is but it was very good!

This stall name is 91 Fried Kway Teow Mee but the address & photos are that of another stall located one floor down at unit #B1-37 ; called Golden Mile Fried Kway Teow Mee.See the attached photos showing 91 Fried Kway Teow Mee at unit #01-91. And also Golden Fried Kway Teow Mee at unit #B1-37 ( enlarge the top signboard of this photo to see unit nos).Anyway, the Fried Kway Teow Mee ( fried noodles) at this stall (91) is very good. Not oily & very tasty. We could see regular queues here.Definitely worth trying & coming again
