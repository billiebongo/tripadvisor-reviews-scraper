My sisters and I had lunch recently here. Staff were very friendly and helpful with choices. The food was lovely. Shame more cafes and restaurants weren't as attentive to their customers. Highly recommended.

Lively restaurant and relaxed atmosphere, good taste of simple Vietnamese food.
Great attitude by all the staff. Very friendly and helpful.
Go early as all the spring rolls and crab dishes had finished by 8:30.

The dining space was rather small, but the food comes in big portions. Very reasonably priced and tasty. The staff is attentive to our needs too. It doesn't come with any service charges, so, do prepare to tip!

The place was cozy, although the music was on the loud side. We ordered two dinner sets that were both delicious and of good value. Would definitely go back again!

Happened to look at the other reviews about them, and decided to bring my friends here. And they did not disappoint. Value for money dinner set, that included a side, a main and a drink. Superb quality and portions, definitely will drop by again.

I had the dry noodles with pork, it was a hearty serving and I liked that there was a bit of crunch from the shredded vegetables. Also, the dressing that came with the noodles complemented the pork really well. Scrumptious!

Food was good and service great but restaurant was more for a quick meal than somewhere to hang out for drinks after work.

Very accomodating for coeliacs willing to change sauces etc. I had a pho that had some beautiful beef in the soup

Went there upon recommendation of a friend. Booked for 7 people. We were put outside. When asked to move inside, they said that they cannot cater for 7 people inside as it will be blocking the way and it’s not safe for us. Asked whether they can join tables (instead of adding chair which might block the way), they also said it cannot be done. This place is so not flexible even though we’ve told them the reason we asked to sit inside was because our baby was not feeling well, plus there were smoking people walking past. This place also doesn’t have baby chair, though they finally got us one but according to the waitress, it was borrowed from next door or something. In the end, we sat inside on split tables. I wish they can be more flexible in the future.

Amazing vegetarian pho! I was unable to get veggie pho when I was in Vietnam, an this one here exceeds the expectations, it's extremely aromatic and full of flavour. Good one for an evening meal! Staff is usually very nice and helpful, so I definitely recommend it - even for a vegetarian bahn mi, not included in a menu but staff will help and provide it

Ate here with colleagues for lunch, food was quickly served and very delicious. Great value for a lunch and attentive and fast service without fault.
5
They have a veggie option which is great. Big serving, fast service, consistent quality. Great for lunch.

The dinner set was SG 15.5 including one entrée, one main, one house tea which was pretty good value. Although no split bills which can be annoying when visiting with friends. Overall it's quite nice for a casual night out.

Nice simple Vietnamese place in this area of many bars and simple restaurants. Environment is very casual inside and the outside tables are right by the road, so it scores as a casual cheap eats place rather than anything more, but for what it is, it's good

My benchmark is Pho bo (beef) from Springvale, Richmond in Melbourne, Cabramatta in Sydney or simply Pho 88 , Than Brothers or 69 or any pho eatery in the west coast USAThe beef i had here hardly contain beef slices (let alone rare beef) and is overcooked .There are no basil leaves nor enough bean sprouts as they do generously in the above countries I would defer to any one from Vietnam eating her whom would say good 'pho bo' (i am told the cook is from vietnam ! (really?)The soup tastes medicinal range of beef stock. i also feel thirsty afterwards(overdose msg?) Maybe i should try other dishes here which might change my mind !At $12 a bowl i m better off trying the other australia vietnamese pho eatery at L2 Asia square - bigger bowl n cost $15 w more beef

My wife wanted good Vietnamese food for her birthday and most reviews pointed to Fat Saigon Boy. So we gave it a shot and did not regret it at all. The food was really good. Gerald our friendly and helpful server - who seemed to be the manager as well - advised us on what to order, explaining that the food was not exactly the way it is prepared in Vietnam but are cooked in the way the chef interpreted Vietnamese food should be cooked. For starters we ordered a chicken-pork roll wrapped in vermicilli noodles (the pork replacing shrimp which I am allergic to) and a salmon fish cake with cream. For mains, we had Pho with roast duck and their signature roasted lemon grass pork noodles. Gerald gave us a complementary dessert which they were experimenting with called cofee trifle.Everything was delicious. They had a beer special - 3 for the price of 2 - which together with the reasonable prices made the meal very good value for money. I only wished they had served some wine to go with the excellent food

Fat Saigon Boy is on a great little street with lots of other restaurants and bars. It's nice and casual inside, and we ordered from their set menu which was great value for money. We went near closing time and unfortunately they had run out of the vegetarian options, but they cooked me up something special and it was absolutely delicious! Some of the best Vietnamese food I've ever eaten. Service was fast and the staff were really delightful. Definitely recommend if you're looking for something easy, affordable and super tasty in a cool area of town

I am not very experienced with Singapore or with Vietnamese food, but I wandered around Telok Ayer Road looking for a place to have dinner. Found this restaurant and was warmly greeted and shown a table. The waiter gave me a quick explanation of how the menu worked and brought me some water. I ordered the dinner set with rice and roasted veggies, very good were the salmon cakes and the lemon tea. I added a fried egg to the veggie dish and spent a total of 17.00 SGD

I had never been a fan of Vietnamese food but this restaurant changed my mind. I'm in love with Vietnamese food now. The pho and the appetisers are great and it's very economical. I would like the coconut drink the next time I visit the restaurant
4
The pho is great - quite authentic which is hard to find in Singapore. Interesting menu and I struggled to decide as they all seemed interesting. First time I had seen a duck pho on a menu! The broth was full of beef flavour and the noodles are not too soft - generous amounts of beef. The rice paper rolls were tasty. Staff were attentive and quick. The first serving of the rice paper rolls had broken when they served it to us and they were quick to change it for us

My 2nd visit since last time, where the restaurant was still in Ann Siang road. Very crowded during lunch time, but quiet for dinner.
The chicken vermicelli bowl is very yummy, fresh and tasty.

Recently relocated to Telok Ayer street. Lovely staff, highly efficient during peak hours. Very good quality/price ratio.

Good simple vietnamese food in an old shophouse in a fantastic street in Singapore . They say it is car free on week ends . Sorry I had to leave to home but will check on my next trip !

Close to the usually pricey Club Street, this place is a great find. Food was economical, fresh and very tasty, and the alcoholic drinks were very good value as well.

The restaurant only opens at 5.30 in the evening. I was early so I sat outside to wait, and the staff actually brought water out for me while I waited! Customer service was great and of course the food was good. They had a $15 dinner set which include a starter, a main and a drink. Loved the spicy pulled pork burrito and the beef pho. They also have a delicious honey tea. Wish they'd open on the weekends

These guys serve their dishes at affordable prices in CBD (note they relocated to Telok Ayer China Square) and what pleases me most is that they do not compromise on quality and taste. You can tell that they have spent hours boiling the pho stock and the quality of the rice noodle is just so satisfying. This is one place that deserves to stick around in the long term, and the daily work lunch crowd is testament to that
5
The title says it all. Awesome pho, both the beef and chicken are really aromatic and so filling we probably did not need the ribs starter (which was also very tasty). Well worth the price. They even sell Coopers Ale which I have not had in some time. Friendly service. Will revisit soon
5
I was in Vietnam two years ago and I can say here I had a delicious Vietnamese meal and good portions! The best meal we had in Singapore. If you like Vietnamese it is a must go! They do not have too many dishes which is always a good sign of quality
5
We were opposite the restaurants having some beers and decided to try out this Australian-vietnamese fusion place, food was surprisingly good, especially the ribs for starter, and the tenderloin beef main course was easy to eat and flavorful. Staff are friendly and helpful. Price is pretty reasonable too ($45 for a starter + main course + beer) so we will be returning for sure

The service was way too slow and frustrating because they forgot some of the food I ordered. There was also a drunk group of friends making way too much noise, swearing, and annoying everyone, and none of the staff did anything about it. The food itself was ok but nothing great.
