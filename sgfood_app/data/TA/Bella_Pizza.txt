We ate here on a Friday night and it was very popular. We had pizzas and they were very tasty. Nice wine. Good friendly service. Nice ambience. We also liked its location close to the river.
5
We had a birthday dinner here and the pizzas were really good. Not to mention, the service was excellent as well. Staff were very attentive and polite. Overall, an enjoyable time here with great food and great ambience.
4
This place is friendly with customiszing a bit of your order, pizza and pasta are fresh and nice. There are meat selection for those that doesn’t eat carbs too.
4
Best pizza in Singapore and nice location next to the river. We will definitely come again very soon!
4
Some of the best pizza I've had in recent memory. I especially liked the Pizza Bella Pizza: ricotta cheese, spinach and pepperoni. Yummy. Go for happy hour from 6-7:30 for 10% of some menu items.
4
Bella serves a number of different pizzas for which they have an oven for. This makes the pizza, properly made with thin crust, nice and crusty. The flavours are also good and coupled with good service (aside from one lapse when, ironically, I was trying to ask for the bill), makes for a good meal experience
4
This is a regular pre show dinner stop for us as a family before going to the Singapore Repertory Theatre. The restaurant sits by the river and if the conversation dries up, there is plenty of passer-bys to talk about! Great atmosphere, to chillax over a high carb diet and a bottle of wine or two. Rain or shine, the al fresco area is always breezy and cool. For families with children, this is a perfect location to have dinner while the children can run around by the river.The waiters are friendly and accommodating, and if it is not too busy, they will accommodate orders from their sister restaurant - Bella Pasta's menu next door
4
Had dinner here before so decided to visit this place again since we're nearby. The thin crust pizza was soft but still crispy on the outside and the topping it's not salty. The potato gnocchi is on the soft side, maybe to suit local taste. The sauce was flavorful, you won't feel just the gnocchi in your mouth after a few bites.
3
We didn't think the food here was all that great and worth the money we spent. I really don't recommend the lasagna, very lacking in flavor. I also would not take an Italian person to this Italian restaurant, they would probably get really pissed off and critical. However we found the service to be good.
5
For the avoidance of gluten some of us have to go to a lot of restaurants before we find something suitable. Not in Singapore! This restaurant had a limited range of gluten free pasta but served it up swiftly and with no extra cost. OK, so I went at a slack lunchtime but the quality was good and the view splendid
4
Tasty thin crust pizza, about $25 each. We are family of 4 and usually get 2 plus salad. All that, plus beers runs about S$100.
Reserve ahead of time on weekend since outdoor seating can fill up. It a nice section of Robertson quay.
4
An old favorite that has just finished renovation. Good location, service always good and pizza is excellent. Enjoyed a meal with friends in a nice relaxed atmosphere.
3
lovely embrace and environment. we ordered the pizza Napolenata but it was salty. Dessert wise we ordered Lava cake which is to our like
3
Quiet on a weekday which was nice. Pizza was ok, but the dough was abit too chewy and oily. I chose their signature white pizza
5
Wonderful, authentic wood fired pizza, great ingredients with friendly and attentive staff. Lovely setting and a great meal.
5
Pizzas are delicious ! Outdoor terrace with a pretty view of the river from Robertson Quay. Price is fair too.
5
I am a regular at this restaurant (am here at least once a month!) which has served excellent pizzas and pastas for as long as I can remember. Usually my family or friends or business colleagues sit outside as indoors used to be poorly ventilated (leaving one smelling like one had just finished a 12-hour shift at a pizzeria!) but it has just completed some extensive renovations and the new extractor fans seem to be much better! We were just there on 5 August 2017 and being seated indoors was not an issue.Anyway, the pizzas here are delicious - one cannot go wrong with any of them but I would highlight the pizza con rucola, pizza appetitosa or the pizza diavola. The pastas are also great by themselves with our favourite being the spaghetti carbonara or the fettucine salsiccia e tartufo. Service is also prompt and pleasant
5
We were so lucky to get seated outdoor overlooking the canal - is good for a people watching. We ordered a burrata pizza and Italian beer to enjoy the quiet Friday evening. The only thing is - why no have happy hour for drinks =( ? Anyway, we will still go back to this place =)
4
We are couples from australia we stayed at robertson quay hotel,we had dinner at bella pizza my husband had prosciuto funghi pizza and i had my bolognese...it was a wonderful dinner the food is so good and the pizza as well.We even had good pizza here compared when we were in italy,the staff were all very friendly and very good service...we will surely comeback on our next visit..
1
I decided to have a Pizza at Bella Pizza in Singapore.Last friday.I was tempted by the name as I am italian and missed home food.The experience is very negative and I will never go back.The service is so slow! ai took them 45 minuts to serve us a pizza.Pizza? Quite not:rather a chewing gum with some tomato.This is not pizza! The starter was " prosciutto con burrata".Prosciutto and burrata should be imported from Italy if you have an Italian restaurant...All tastes were fake so could not be genuine italian.The wine was served hot and I had to ask them to bring ice and put the bottle into an ice bucket.Result:terrible experience and the bill was 180 S$ . I will say at large next time in Singapore
5
First night in Singapore so played safe and went for pizza, not disappointed really light, tasty and one if the best I have had in ages. Hubby had lasagne said very tasty .
Friendly staff and a good atmosphere .
5
Was travelling on my own , a middle aged European woman. Eat 3 consecutive nights .fabulous meals pasta and risotto service friendly professional and efficient and I was made to feel very welcome
5
Always a great place for pizza and pasta! thin crust and many options to choose from. Desserts not necc. worth it. Service is always friendly and quick.
4
The combination of good pizza, beer and a wonderful spot along the river make this place a winner for taking the family out. Not cheap, but not terribly expensive.
Call ahead to reserve a table with a prime spot outside.
4
we all had Pizza for dinner which was very good.
we where a group of 9 and the service friendly and good.
I would recommend this restaurant to anyone how like pizza.
4
Ordered the tagliatelle beef ragu and pappardelle salami pasta dish. Best tagliatelle I've had so far in Singapore. My Son was ok with the pappardelle, though nothing fantastic. Garlic bread too oily. Service is friendly till it got too busy. No cheap but not too expensive either, expect to fork out more cash for this than most Italian restaurants, pasta dishes are $24 and up
5
Good pizza is genuinely difficult to find in SG. I have been looking for the past 15 years, and Bella Pizza immediately goes on my list of keepers. This is a thin crust pizza with many variations on a theme available. But the crust is thin and delicious, tangy sauce, and good service. Rodney is a star. We ordered a Masi wine which was light and very drinkable. Well worth the price, even with SG pricing. I will absolutely be back. I have tried so many pizzas in SG and the vast majority fall short. But not Bella Pizza. This place is a keeper.
5
We just popped in for a quick pizza and got surprised. Pizza's were really good, just like the ones you get in Naples, Italy. Especially burrata pizza was super good. Pizza's weren't cheapest you can find but if you're looking for a good pizza, this is place to go. Menu looked nice as well
5
It was a warm evening with a cooling breeze occasionally wafting up the river so we sat outside and enjoyed a selection of pizzas as well as a calzone and eggplant parmigiana. We enjoyed a red wine to wash it all down and had a very pleasant dinner. The staff were extra friendly and attentive. Weâ€™ll add this one to our list of places to go back to
4
It's all about the pizza.Great price and great service for crunchy pizza and warm service.Even for Singapore standards or being expensive and inadequate service.Great for an early evening on a table outside right when the area gets lively and fun.Good option at the Qua
3
Pizzas are still good at Bella Pizza - though quality seems to have degraded over the years. Service, like every where else in Singapore, has deteriorated. However, Bella Pizza remains a place to be on your short list for lunch or dinner with Pizzas!
4
taste of Italian cuisine at fantastic prices, pizza perfectly saved, the size of pizza is thrilled me, is perfect for two people..
5
I chose this place because my 3yo daughter wanted pizza and it had the best review. I was not disappointed.
The pizza was delicious and the staff very friendly.
2
Was here for lunch on a weekday. Got the Pasta Siciliano - Penne with Eggplant, Basil, Tomato sauce, and unfortunately, a heavy helping of oil, which messed with what could've been a good pasta. Oil dripped through the dish leaving a terribly greasy after taste. Won't be going back here any time soon
3
We decided to try this place and ordered a Parma ham and rucola pizza. Pretty ordinary for the price. Not that we eat pizza with cutlery in general, but they should try using their blunt knives to cut their pizzas. Went once but won't be going back
1
NEVER COMING BACK. They have the worse service and a low level of professionalism I've ever come across. The Vongole white wine pasta was bad because the white clams served were totally not fresh. There was so little sauce that we would have thought the sauce were spilled or that we had ordered an Aglio Olio pasta dish. The few of us took 1 spoonful of pasta and 1 clam each before we realised the clams tasted bad. When we informed the service crew about the pasta being not fresh, he simply told us that their clams were ordered daily so clams were definitely fresh. He then took back the dish into the kitchen without informing us what he intended to do with the plate of remaining. We waited for sometime and finally decided to ask them what happened to the plate of leftover clams and strands of spaghetti. The service crew told us that we had finished the plate of pasta and if we wanted them to cook another one, we would have to order another one. Mind you, the plate contained some remaining pieces of clams alright. In the end, after another service crew/ restaurant manager came to us, he took away all our plates, probably to determine how many clams the whole load of us ate. Including the ones we spitted out. He then mentioned he couldn't do anything for us like recook another plate of FRESH calms (excluding the spaghetti of course) except to give us a discount. Discount ended up to be a 25% only. If there were an option to choose ZERO star, trust me that we would have chosen it.Also, we didn't bother to take anymore photos after the first dish because the food didn't look execptionally delicious as well. Food was average
4
The restaurant serve good Pizza (not thin Pizza the one I had (Diavola)), but quite good pizza. It was "hot", so next time I do not need to put on the spices they served with the Pizza before I tasted. They had nice Italian read wine to go with it. The Bruschetta was not like what I get in Italy, but a good belly fill before the Pizza. Food was served quickly.
3
Found this place after searching for places for calzone, not so common in Italian restaurants in Singapore. The place is located by the river, has good service. Pizzas are good, so was Calzone. However the lasagna I ordered was a disappointment; pasta was dry and the dish had not much of a taste. I would not go back for the lasagne, that is for sure, maybe for pizza.A pleasant surprise was the complimentary dessert, it being Father's day lunch
5
Had a great experience dining here. Pizza and Pasta was great. Service staff was attentive and apologize a couple of time as our food came slightly late. Overall, great place if you are looking for authentic Pizza. Plus point - great view if you choose to have the outdoor seating
4
Me and my wife enjoyed a dinner inside Bella Pizza, where we found an Italian pretty warm atmosphere. We could reach this place in 10 minutes walk from Clarke Quay MRT station along the Singapore River. We liked the decorations on the walls and the style of tables and chairs. The menu was amazing and the list of wine even more with a lot of labels selected for an high quality/price ratio, i.e. well worthy labels. I could find most of my favorite Italian dishes with many original ingredients and recipes. We experienced a high level service and all waiters were really nice to us. We ordered Bruschetta, Ham and Salami large plate and Pizza Margherita as well as a glass of Prosecco sparkling white wine from Alta Marca Trevigiana for my wife and a glass of Chianti red wine from the Province of Siena in Italy for myself. A top brand mineral water from Italy was also served in a chilled glass bottle for the best pureness. We ended this simple dinner with a tasteful dessert: tiramisu'. This pizzeria-restaurant has been recommended by my ex colleague Justin (Singaporean like my wife), who I thanked a lot. He was in Italy some years ago and he experienced the original cooking there
5
Came here after a long flight and it hit the spot in every way! Delicious, fresh salad and amazing thin crust salmon pizza! Very authentic taste. Wine was great and the service was very attentive / friendly ! Thanks for the great experience.
5
Real good food with great staff. Every night we stopped here for coffe,, ended up with wine and dessert ! Their canolli chocolat is dangerous! Love this spot on the riverbank.
If ever in Singapore again we will come back!
4
One of the nicest pizzas I've had in Singapore. Tried the Bolognese too; while I thought it was a bit bland, others said they liked it.
5
Excellent Calzone Napoletana. I have eaten here many times and never been disappointed. Try it for yourself. I'm sure you'll enjoy it.
4
Very good pizza! Appetizers with prosciutto and cheese are also extremely good.
Wine selection is pretty decent.
Overall we had a very nice and tasty dinner
4
Light lunch at Bella Pizza. Situated near our hotel in Clark quay. Service is good and so is the quality of the food. Some people had pasta with seafood, which looked very good. Have to go back to try those.
4
I was very impressed with Bella Pizza after recently dining at the restaurant. Location is great in Robertson Quay on the river - nice outdoor seating for taking in the atmosphere of people walking along the river. The pizza was very good - traditional Italian base, cooked to perfection and good quality toppings. Reasonably priced. Special mention to the waiter Mark who was excellent - prompt, professional, friendly. Highly recommended
4
We've been going to Bella Pizza (and its sister restaurant, Bella Pasta) since it first opened years ago. The original owner and Chef, Antonio, is no longer there unfortunately, as his personal service, memory of loyal customers, and general personality helped make this place special. Added to this was the oft received complimentary Limoncello at the end of your meal, and it felt like you were quite special. Very good pizza for Singapore
5
We ordered bacon pizza and margarita both were awesome and prices were really good.U can also have a great dessert Order some wine and enjoy the river view! I went there at night so the lights and river and atmosphere were great...U won't regret
4
One night we fancied Italian. Husband and the kids love pizza, I'm not so keen but this place had pasta dishes on the menu. Husband and the kids adored their pizza. I opted for the Ravioli Verdi which was the most sublime ever. The service was not quite so efficient but had an engaging quirkiness about it, rather Fawlty Towers in its way. We went to Bella Pizza three times and each time, it was like the staff were surprised customers had turned up. We ordered various dishes for starters, olives, garlic bread, spinach leaves with mango, avocado and prawns, and the 'starters' arrived with the meal. Despite service being a bit on the chaotic side, we liked Bella Pizza, it was lovely sitting outside in the evening and the house red was divine
4
Good Pizza at a decent price. They also offer salads, and pastas from their sister restaurant Bella Pasta.
4
Tasty, wood fired pizza. Perhaps too much cheese but the base and crust was just right. Husband had the cannelloni, which was tasty. Pretty nice overall, service was good, expensive but it is Clarke Quay after all!
4
The service, pizza and ambience offer an excellent combination of a great dinner out!
The classic pizza menu & wine selection; it's central location by the river and great staff is hard to match elsewhere!
4
It was delicious and authentic. A great place to come and sit after a long day of walking around. Great service.
3
The pizza is very good for Non-Italians and acceptable for Italians. Quite expensive but you are in Clarke Quay where everything is expensive.
Anchovies on the pizza are too salty..
Two pizzas + two glass of wine = 60+ sgd
5
Small cosy place with wonderful authentic italian pizza. Great toppings and a good crust. This is a place worth to go.
Located at the Robison Quay, near good bars for a night out.
5
Located on Robertson Quay, it's now only slightly easier to grab a table without a reservation than it was in the past. Specializing in Napolitano pies in both white and red, any of these can be made into calzones easily. If pizza isn't your thing (why are you here?) there are loads of pastas and other mains that suit. Note: if you can't find a table at Bella Pizza, you can sit at their sister restaurant, Bella Pasta, just around the corner, and order pizzas
5
We had a summit with employee's from all over the world and settled on Bella Pizza as the place for our team dinner. We had more than 20 people in the party and the staff was fantastic making sure everyone was taken care of and drinks stayed filled despite a wide variety of drinks. We had a bunch of different pizza's and all were great, and also had the "meat platter" which can easily serve 10 people. I've eaten here 3-4 times and never left hungry. Absolutely fantastic
4
The best italian at Robertson quay area. Must try their pizza boat. For me this is the second best italian restaurant in Singapore, with Valentino is the first one for me. Homey and unpretentious feeling as well for bella pizza. Its been around for ages and still always crowded even on weekdays. A must try italian in SG.
5
Our party of 4 had: Pizza Boscailola with added anchovies, Pizza Quarto Formaggi, and Linguini Frutti Di Mare X2. But let's talk about the pizza, which is all about the crust: crispy, wood-fired and tasted great with the toppings. I asked for freshly chopped chilli on the side (because I've been assimilated into Singapore), no problem. Service was pleasant and noone forced us to buy bottled water, love that
5
I'm half Italian. Usually when I order pizza outside of Italy I end up disappointed. Not this time. We had two pizzas that were well up to Italian standards. Reasonable wine at a reasonable price.
5
no wonder they got so many award... u will know why once u experience yourself.... dont forget to make reservation before u go
4
It was late and we couldn't decide where to eat, I felt like Italian so my niece recommended Bella Pizza as it was away from the crowded Robertson Walk.I ordered the Ravioli, which was delicious but for the price there was not enough, about 8 pockets and a little sauce, not worth the money.My nieces husband was going to warn me not to order the pasta as the servings are very small, they both ordered pizzas and ended up giving some of theirs.The service was very good, but there was construction going on in the area at the time and the wall that was up blocked the view of the river which was a shame.If I go back I will definitely be ordering pizza to get my moneys worth.When searching on internet it comes up as Bella Pizza and Bella Pasta
4
We were looking for a dinner that was not Asian, just because our two weeks in Asia had been filled with Asian food. Bella Pizza fit the bill. My husband had a meat pizza and I had eggplant with Parmesan and a delicious portabella mushroom appetizer. John felt his pizza was good, but not fantastic, but I loved my appetizers. If we had not had wine, the restaurant would have been a very good value, but with the wine choices were quite expensive. The restaurant staff themselves were excellent, and though we ate inside because of threat of rain, both would have been lovely and available. All in all it was a very nice dinner and I would highly recommend it
4
Bella Pizza was recommended by a colleague of mine, who said that our Italian visiting colleagues confirm that the pizza here is like the authentic Italian pizza.I reserved online a day before the dinner, for 11 people and waited for their confirmation as acknowledged in the email I received. They were closed on a Monday when I reserved online. Unfortunately, when I called to follow-up the day next day, I was told that my reservation was not endorsed so we can only be given the tables outside. It would have not mattered if not for the fact that the area was ongoing renovation so our view was the white wall covering the renovation area. Now, for the food. We ordered calamari, melanzane parmigiana and the bella pizza antipasto before our main dish. They were all great! For the main dish, since we ordered for sharing, we got to sample the lasagna, ravioli, carbonara and seafood pasta. I especially liked the seafood pasta.The pizzas we tried - bella pizza, crudo, rustico (special of the day), pizza con rucola and salmone are all good! The food made it up for the lack of good view :-). Not to forget, the tiramisu was perfect!To top these all, service is commendable! I look forward to better coordination though for the online reservation
4
2nd time here with the family. Appetizers were perfect for sharing and we're big fans of the fresh mozzarella and prosciutto.The kids love the Pizza Boats - sort of a modified calzone. Their red and white base pizzas are always good.Service is prompt, friendly and able to communicate clearly.The downside, like all places in Singapore is that 2 pizza boats, 2 pizzas, 2 appetizers, 2 glasses of wine and an iced tea will set you back $180SGD.I can get far better pizza in the US for half of this price
5
We went to celebrate my niece's birthday. The restaurant was accommodating of my mother being in a wheelchair and did not mind that food was shared - there was 11 of us.The food (both pizza, pasta and appetizers) were excellent! The pizzas served had thin crust and were freshly made in their wood-fired oven. The squid ink pasta was delish :) and yes, we would visit the establishment again
3
I'll be frank; if it wasn't for the pizza, this place gets a 1 star rating for this review. The food, atmosphere and service are that bad that the pizza is the one saving grace that this place has. So if you only come for pizza, you will walk away extremely happy! Our dining party took some issue with things on the menu...or rather not on the menu. My friend wanted Beef Carpaccio, which they don't have, sadly (can't knock a restaurant too hard for this though). I wanted a glass of Chianti. Nope, was told they don't have that, we'd have to get a bottle of Chianti. I mean, in Italy I am pretty sure they drag you before a judge or magistrate and fine you for being an Italian restaurant without a glass of Chianti on the menu, right? That delicious sounding Limoncello Mojito? Not available, they were out of Limoncello. We ordered two appetizers to start: The Bocconcini Di Napoli (cherry tomatoes with little bite-sized mozzarella balls on a bed of arugula) and the Bruschetta. Both were unremarkable and rather bland dishes. The Bruschetta was nothing to write home about and could have done with better bread too. The price (S$8) for what you get is totally not worth it though. The Bocconcini (S$7) was even worse: a small, pathetic looking plate of unseasoned, mediocre ingredients that you could honestly find better in a grocery store and make at home. And then came the pizza which is the star of this restaurant. What a DELICIOUS pizza! We had the pizza with tomato and buffalo mozzarella and it was fantastic. The sauce is flavorful and they cook the pizza to absolute perfection that melts the slices of the mozzarella just perfectly so that when you bite into it you get this creamy, milky taste with that luscious sauce. It's the perfect combination. Service here is spotty though and borders on disorganized. Bottom line (and probably the only reason I would return), stick with ordering pizza and you should be fine. Despite them not having Chianti by the glass, we did have a decent glass of red wine which paired nicely with the pizza
1
Pizza was just ok. I can do better spaghetti. Rest forget it and never never order their so called seafood platter specialty. A total rip off ($150 for 4 persons - 4 prawns, 1-2 pieces and 8 squids) and not fresh at all. he prawns are dry and tasteless...overcooked. The fish is not fresh and any hawker stall beats it. The so called calamari are just 8 full totally bland squids.. never going to visit it again.I noted the whole kitchen is manned by 3-4 Indians
4
We took 2 friends to dinner at Bella Pizza last night. Uncomplicated menu, good value for money. We had a couple of starters, 2 pizzas and 2 desserts to share, just right in terms of quantity. Only bottled beers are available and are a tad expensive. Service was courteous and reasonably quick . The riverside location provides its own special ambience, request outdoor seating when making the booking
4
We order beers, mascarpone pizza and cannelloni... all good but cannelloni was spectacular!!!!
Service is ok, we had to ask for some bread and olive oil while we wait the food.
Location is perfect, price razonable to be Singapore
4
Pizza is good. Ingredients are very italian. Service excellent. Some drinks are really italian (especially the cocktails). We had pizza but we saw nice pasta to other tables. Atmosphere is excellent on Riverwalk and good for couples or special occasions.
5
this place makes the best pizza. I have travelled all through Italy and even waited in line for over an hour in Naples Pizzeria da Michele. Bella Pizza is just as good!
4
Not our first time here at Robertson Quay. An Italian owns the place and knows how to get pizza right. It's casual, well priced, an just ok wine list but worth a visit.
5
This is the second time we ate there on our 7 day stay in Singapore it was that good. Staff were attentive and friendly, and upon our second visit the owner greeted and sat us, she was so nice and happy to engage in some banter. The staff remembered us from last time and even remembered or last order. The pizza Appetitosa was very tasty considering how little ingredients and the seafood pasta my partner had was fresh, flavorsome and well portioned. If we were here longer we'd definitely be dining there again
5
After hearing many recommendations, I went to Bella Pizza for the first time for a friend's birthday on Friday night. Usually, I am rarely impressed by Italian food in Singapore but last night changed my mind so much that I had to write a review. The restaurant was elegant, warm and overlooking the river. Ambiance is excellent and perfect for cosy get togethers with friends. The service was the best I've had in Singapore and all of the staff were so friendly and attentive. We didn't have to wait long for food and when it came, the portions were decent and delicious. All the pastas we ordered were PERFECTLY cooked with authentic rich sauces. Pizza was amazing with crispy crust and they are not stingy with the toppings. The ingredients they use are the finest and you could see the passion and care they have taken in preparing the food. They also have the best calamari I've eaten in Singapore! The staff were very outgoing and great fun. They even made all of us a special shot at the end of our night It was amazing, I wish I got the name of it. This place is now my most recommended place. Definitely will be back here again!
5
You can eat inside or outside, overlooking the river and one of its very flashy red lightened bridge, which may eventually blind you ... but it is not the point here ... I just looked somewhere else and enjoyed quietness and the 8:00pm breeze.Staff are efficient and nice.Pizza crust was crispy and flavorsome.Right amount of good quality cheese, well cooked onions ... It was delicious.
3
We are being treated quite quickly as soon as they open. However, maybe because we arrived a little bit early (they open at 5:30PM, we started to sit outside their restaurant around 5:20PM), the waiter is not quite ready to work. He was quite busy with something inside we cannot see, but we cannot order any food up to 10 minutes after choosing our menu.We were ordered Pizza Con Rucola and plain water. The pizza itself was delicious, but the parmesan shaving was boring. They just cut the parmesan and put it on top of the pizza. However, the crust was remarkable.It costs us SGD30.6 (after tax), which is quite overpriced, at least for us
2
We came here for dinner and had two pizza and one bottle of sparkling water (70 sgd). The pizza bread was good but we didn't like the ingredients like prosciutto di Parma (which was too salty, too fatty and with pieces of bone) porcini (it was good but only ONE) and sausage (I removed it from the pizza, it was disgusting). Overall I haven't been satisfied, considering the ingredients quality it's overpriced.
4
I visited this restaurant with a friend of mine. The manager Antonio was very friendly and welcoming. We ordered pizzas and some pasta from the sister restaurant next door and while it was a little pricey food was excellent. Reccomend this place for a week day night date - it's very quiet and charming
5
Bella Pizza has really good italian pizza, I don't know if it's the best in Singapore as I always go to Bella Pizza.
Bella Pizza and Bella Pasta (just around the corner) belong to the same owner, and are both quality restaurants.
5
Great little place to have pizza and pasta. Clean restaurant offering Indoor and outdoor seating with river views. Staff are attentative with good understanding of English. Prices are mid range, less then Clarke Quay
5
Great Location on the river, Excellent Service, amazing thin crusted Pizzas and it's great for families too! Pizza Bella is probably some of the region and I highly recommend it.
4
We go regularly to Bella Pizza and Bella Pasta, and they never disappoint. Whether for a romantic meal or a big group meal, it's always good value for money and great food.
4
Service was great. Very polite. had good seats outside looking across the river. We ordered the rucola feta salad and a pizza with buffalo mozzarella. The salad was good, needed more feta cheese and artichokes but less dressing. The Pizza was surprisingly delicious. Best so far in Singapore. (Was about 12 inch size.)All in all, an enjoyable Sunday lunch. Will come back for sure and if you are looking for Pizza in Singapore, look no further
5
We were led here by a reviewer calling this place the best pizza in Singapore. Ambience was nice and cosy. Being sat lunch,the restaurant fills up quickly. Service was quick friendly and prompt. Staff were knowledgeable. But not a single Italian chef so we were wary.Food :We ordered the following;1. Spaghetti carbonara - I am usually not a fan of carbonara as most places make the dish too creamy and sticky. Here they did it very well. The pasta has been cooked and then very well stir fried so that every strand is coated in the well done sauce. Tasty and not creamy. Simple dish done well.2. Linguine marinara - robust with a well stirred wok taste esp the background seafood stock. Choke full of clams, squid and a large prawn. Pasta was al dente. A masterpiece.3. Squid ink pasta - another dish that has been highly touted. Here the squid ink didn't overwhelm the pasta. Enjoyable.4. Capricoso pizza w extra bacon - this is what we came to review. Here the dough is the champion. Unlike skinny pizza which is actually more of a biscuit than real dough, here this is as authentic as a Napoli pizza goes. Crispy and yet flavorful. The toppings were alright but the dough....just goes to show u don't need an Italian chef to come up with good pizza,,,,or the chefs hv been so superbly trained....5. The choc lava cake is also a winner and a great finish. Clever fully served in a cup than on its own which requires a higher level of skill and timing, the lava served here is piping hot and truly yummy....die die must try...This has trumped a lot of our previous fav restaurants. Hope that they can continue to keep with the lofty standards. Prices are kept average but quality is way up there
4
Even though I am Italian I am not - generally speaking - a big pizza lover (I might be the exception that confims the truth about a stereotype!) and I prefer to avoid to eat it when I am abroad. A friend of mine (Italian ex-pat in Singapore) took me to "Bella Pizza" and honestly I must say that the pizza was possibly the best one I have ever abroad, outside my native country and - believe me!- I have been to quite a few places all over the world where the only Italian thing most part of the (so called) Italian restaurants have is just the name, that's it. The ingredients are really genuine and the mozzarella di bufala was a plus, it's not so easy to find a proper one outside some specific areas, imagine at 10000km away from where it is being made..

Take a look around at the size of the pizzas going to other tables and order accordingly. Between two of us we shared a single pizza and a rocket salad. Excellent, quick service and our meal was hot and delicious. Average cost was around $25 per pizza. Best part was the river view along the walk with boats going by and people walking past. Good for kids

One of the best pizza I've ever taste in Singapore. Getting there may not be the most convenient way, but it's totally worth it. I went there just to try the pizza out and it turned out to be really good and delicious. The crust is crispy and the top is juicy, tender and flavorful. I love it, recommend it and will go again

I had pizza and a wine glass which were good. The service was good too.As I went out, I asked the staff where to find masks to protect myself from the haze coming from Indonesia. Because it reached record high levels, all shops were out of stock and I had little hope I'd find anything. However the staff offered to give me some they had leftover after purchasing a pack for the restaurant staff - I am very grateful of this kind gesture

Pizza Bella has a good variety o pizzas, calzones and pastas. The wines have a fair price but the selection is limited. I recommend the rocket with parma ham pizza.
4
Situated centrally on the Singapore river - great food and affordable wine. The pasta is good as is the service
5
This is Singapore's best pizza restaurant by far. Order anything - it's amazing - special crust. Service is superb too.

Good variety of thin pizzas to choose from. You can also order from the restaurant 2 doors away with the name also containing the word "bella".

Bella Pizza serves up great pizza, some say it is the best in Singapore.
The service is good, the wine list average, you can buy cheaper pizza elsewhere but more often than not, it won't be as good.
Bella Pizza is excellent for casual dining

Hands down one of the best pizza i've had in Singapore. Bella Pizza was packed on Sunday night but we were still able to get a table on the spot.Ordered calamari... Below avg. Seafood pasta, Very good. Pizza is nicely done and definitely their specialty. Definitely coming back for the pizza
4
Having eaten twice at Bella Pasta we decided to try their sister restaurant for something simple before our late night flight back home. I had the pizza rucola, excellent. My sons each had margarita (one calzone style) and my wife a penne dish - which they also enjoyed. Also killer garlic bread as a starter

There is very little that is memorable about this restaurant. The salads are over-priced, the feta and artichoke salad had 2 tiny pieces of feta and 3 pieces of artichoke. The Vegetable pizza had a few aubergine and a few mushrooms from a can (the best we can tell). Although the wine list makes the wine sound great ... you expectations are far from being realised. If you are in for an average evening, this is your place. Oh yeah, do not expect the bill to be average though

I have tried to pin down what makes these pizzas so much better than anywhere else in Singapore and I think it is a combination of a generosity of ingredients, good quality flour and oil, and the wood fired oven. Anyway forget what the other reviewers say below, this is the best pizza in Singapore. Add to this excellent tender and crisp calamari, fresh rocket salad, lovely tomato and mozzarella, fine quality wines and a good position on Robertson Quay by the waterside, what more could you want

Just had a set lunch at Bella Pizza, with salad and margherita.Asked for bread to go along with the salad and it was never served.Then the set lunch included a dessert and a coffee, but I asked to have a cappuccino instead and the waiter said it was not possible, which I find bizarre.I then asked to see the person in chage to discuss this, and they told me he was away and they were not sure when he would come back.The staff then keep ignoring me, till I decided to pay and go off.Very bad experience and surely I will not return

My 1st time eating at this restaurant and I am not a pizza fan. I was surprise and the food was good including the pizza that we ordered. I will come again.

Pizza's throughout the world are designed to be picked up and eaten.
When we were given a knife and fork, we knew to expect a problem.
Our pizza was soggy and very boring. It was not cheap, not tasty, total waste of money.
3
Not the best but Nice Pizza.Need more toppings.Staff are friendly.
4
The best Pizza in town. Strongly recommended if you want to have an authentic italian pizza in Singapore.
4
A lucky find recommended by a previous Singapore resident. Not a posh place but comfortable with space inside and outside. The reason to be there is the pizza made with great dexterity by the pizza maker. Nothing fancy like wood fired ovens but very well made pizza
4
Very nice and cozy place, just at the river. One of the best Pizzas I've had for long, very crispy, I love the one with Chicken with Artchokes. As a starter go for the Antipasi. Reasonable wines,good and very attentive service. Also visit Bella Pasta, same owner (Antonio), at the corner of the same buildin
5
The pizzas here are absolutely awesome. We had lived near the restaurant and pretty much ate there once a week. Antonio tends to look out for the regulars so we always get excellent service there. Since we've moved, we've not been able to go as frequently but if I get a pizza craving, there is no where else I would rather go. My favorite is prociutto and funghi and my husband loves the diavola. Always enjoy the complimentary lemoncellos too

I was introduced to this restaurant by a friend who lives in Singapore and who had been to this place many times before. I am a vegetarian and I love pizza. I have had pizzas at lot of places before but I have to say that pizza here is one of the best I’ve had. First time we came here during lunch time in the afternoon and the whole area was a bit quiet with no hassle bustle unlike evening. I met chef Antonio who had spent some time with us sharing his earlier experiences in different part of the world. After my first visit, I’ve always visited this place at least once whenever I travel to Singapore. While the place and setting is really good, the service is generally ok – with an exception once or twice. All in all, four stars without any hesitation

This is restaurant is at Robertson quay. I visited this restaurant after reading plenty of positive reviews. I have to admit that it lives up to the hype. The ambience is nice and cozy. It has its own bar! It’s a good place to chill out with friends. The pizzas are classified in to two varieties, the white and red. The Red ones are tomato based pizza while the white ones are cheese based. They sell folded pizzas as well :) The service was just average. The Filipino waitresses were too eager to clear the dishes. Overall it’s a good experience. Give it a try when you're in city and craving for a pizza :

I must admit that I was rather disappointed with the food quality of Bella Pizza. We specially looked for this place due to a good rating here. It has a nice location at Robertson Quay with choices of tables outside or indoor. We had Calamari $20, Pizza Capricciosa $24, Melanzane $ 19, Canneloni della casa $20, Peroni Beer, Moretti Beer $10 each. Melanzane Parmigiana use local long slender eggplant that somehow was too stringy and hard to cut or bite which is a pity considering the taste is good. Cannneloni is rather bland and a bit sweet while pizza is missing some Italian ingredients - or perhaps it was purposedly toned down for the local taste ? The waitress carrying hot canneloni dish slipped the bowl of its plate luckily landed on our table safely. The man who took my booking had bad English comprehension and told me that I could not have a table since 'reserved' ; and after more frustrating questioning I found out that it was Table no.3 was reserved- while I asked to book a table for three. Will I go there again ? Perhaps, just for pizza and I would ask some Italian seasoning or basil extra. Total dinner after 10 % service charge and 7% GST $140

Bella Pizza is located in the cool and calm Robertson Quay. A girlfriend and I were on our way to a neighboring restaurant when we were told they were booked for the night. So we asked Bella Pizza if they had openings and the host said, "yes, one table just for you ladies." The service was excellent and prompt but never pushy. The pizza was amazing! Give Bella Pizza a try

Every time I go to Bella Pasta and Bella Pizza, I feel like I'm back in Italy again for an awesome vacation. The food is always awesome and the service is excellent. As a Singaporean, I love these 2 restaurants. The owner is from Italy, wonder why it's authentic Italian!

Having heard positive reviews about the pizza from Bella pizza, my partner and I decided to give it a try on a Friday night. Understandably, it was packed as it was a weekend night and the restaurant area was considerably small. Nevertheless, it did not deter us and we headed for Bella pasta which serves the same pizza.It was 10pm in the night and the remaining seats available were high chair tables. We agreed to those high chairs while waiting for the customer behind us to leave as they were asking for the bill just as we entered the restaurant. Greeting us with a warm smile while taking our orders, the waitress told us it was not a problem for us to switch tables once the customer leaves. Fearing that the waitress might forget, my partner reminded her again after taking our orders.Shortly after, while we were still waiting for the proper table to be available, a friend of the owner dropped by. They were standing behind me and conversing in Italian with the context of his friend requesting for a table. I ignored the conversation and dismissed the thought that the owner, Antonio, would out rightly display any form of biasness and discrimination.To my utter dismay, the minute the customer left, he told the waitress who was clearing the table for us that the table is to be given to his friend instead. Still keeping my cool, I approached the waitress thinking that there might be some miscommunication about the allocation of tables. Disappointingly, she told me she could no longer switch the tables for us as the boss has requested for the table. Within seconds, Antonio approached us and struck us with the most OUTRAGEOUS and PREPOSTEROUS excuse and even had the audacity to lie in our faces! Apparently, the table was already reserved and the waitress did not know it.(note, it was 10.15pm and the conversation of his friend requesting for a table was held right behind me even though it was conversed in Italian). Also, Bella pasta has no such service of switching the tables even if it is empty. In exact words, he said "I do not know who promised to switch the table for you but we do not allow any changing of tables and you will not have that table."Having worked in the service industry before, such actions are unpardonable! He made no effort in resolving the problem (ie, suggesting to switch tables when the next one is available) but instead displayed such appalling and repugnant behaviour. In the end, my partner and I decided to leave as we will stand no such insult and biasness in our own country.It is most disappointing that such revolting service is still prevalent in times whereby service is regarded as one of the main focus in the F&B industry. We will never patronize this restaurant again and we will spread this horrid experience to our fellow Singaporean friends

This is one of my favorite places to eat in Singapore. The owner, Antonio is very friendly and welcoming and always makes a point to come over and chat with us when we visit.The food is simple but tasty and offers very good value for your dollar.I recommend the Pizza Diavola

Scrolling through the comments so far, this place seems polarise people, with a rating of one or five.I've been a few times, and the pizza seems to me to be consistently fantastic. The first time we went was because someone who I figured knew their pizzas had told me it was "definitely the best pizza in Singapore".I'm not enough of a pizza connoisseur to know whether that's really true or not, but the pizzas we've had have definitely been very, very good.There are a couple of tables outside. It's not exactly "right on the river" because there's a small paved area inbetween, but it's nice outside at around sunset, and the local families come by with their dogs and skateboards and rollerblades. Inside it's pleasant enough, a fairly homely Italian restaurant. Service seemed efficient, but no-one seemed to smile much.I haven't tried anything on the menu other than the pizza, but if it's pizza you're looking for then I'd definitely recommend that you give it a try

I am a resident in Singapore and this is close to the worst mean I have had. We decided to try a different local restaurnat and compared with the others this fell very far short.The Bruschetta had no herbs or attempt at flavouring.My raviola tasted like Bisto suace was used, I could count the sqaures and can inform readers each cost $3 !I asked the waitress if the portion size was wrong but she just shrugged.Do not go here in any circumstances, the other Italian restuarants are far superior to this apology

It was last Sunday night and the restaurant looked busy which I took as a good sign. Service friendly and helpful. Wine list good and interesting. Ordered a very good Italian white ($85), pizza and garlic bread. Garlic bread was not toasted enough so tasted like stale bread zapped in a hot oven as opposed to toasted...pizza was soft and soggy in the middle - AWFUL - could only eat edge and topping; left a Mt Kilimanjaro sized pile of pizza dough on the plate; waiter asked if I enjoyed my meal - obviously NOT as I explained the middle was too soggy to eat - he just shrugged his shoulders. Had to ask for the bill twice. Wine was nice but would want to be for the price. Tables outside are very close together so diffficult to avoid hearing conversations at adjoining tables..not a good night

This is the best pizza shop in Robertson Quay area. We eat here often & the food is consistently great. The staff are good & responsive & the Italian owner is super-friendly.Their best pizza - the Pizza Italia - is not on the menu, so seek it out. As a special touch, when they bring the bill, there is also often (but not always) a free glass of limoncello for each diner.Disappointingly, their pasta is not very good, so don't go here (or to Bella Pasta) for pasta. My score is for the pizzas only

Went for dinner at their sister restaurant Bella Pasta last night with my wife and 3 friends. They put the Bella Pizza menu on our table saying we could order from there too. (IMPORTANT NOTE. We didn't ask for the Bella Pizza menu. They put it on our table). We ordered drinks, appetizers and mains from Bella Pasta and got a Napoletana pizza from Bella Pizza. That was about 8:45 pm. By 9:20, we had finished our appetizers and were starting on our mains when I followed up our pizza for the second time with our server. She promised it would be out in 10 minutes. By 9:30, we were halfway into our mains and still no pizza. I see the chef. or manager or owner (whoever he is, he's this Caucasian male in some uniform) nearby so I asked him for help. I was expecting some sympathy, maybe even hoping for an apology, but instead, I got one of the stupidest excuses I've ever heard for late food. He said, "These are 2 different companies. I can't control when the food will arrive." Without giving me a chance to speak, he waves his hands and walks away. Frankly, I was too shocked to complain further and I didn't want to ruin the meal with my friends so I kept quiet, hoping that the pizza would arrive soon.By 9:45pm, we were done and still no pizza. I called our server to inform her that since in the words of her boss, Bella Pizza was a different company and since we were done and the pizza never arrived, we were cancelling the order. We had given them an hour. We asked for our bill promising to pay for whatever we consumed, but no more than that.5 minutes later, I was given another shock when the same Caucasian chef/manager/owner tries to lay the pizza down on our table. I couldn't believe what kind of idiot this guy was. Ofcourse we refuse. His genius of an excuse was simply, "Do you expect us to follow up your order over there every 5 minutes?" After I ask him if it really takes more than hour to make a Napoletana pizza, he walks away.You'd think that that would be the end of it, but when we get the bill, which we ofourse were going to check, they try to sneak the pizza in by calling it an open item. I mean, you couldn't make this stuff up! SHAMELESS! We give it back and they correct it. We pay $250 and leave with our night ruined.After looking at the other reviews for this restaurant, I realize I'm not the first one who's been disasppointed by their service. I hope others don't make the same mistake. DON'T PATRONIZE BELLA PIZZA OR BELLA PASTA! It's really not worth it

Located in the Robinson Quay complex facing the river, Bella Pizza is incredibly popular for its pasta and pizza. We visited on a Sunday night and were fortunate to have made a reservation. We were seated immediately and avoided a long wait which seemed to be the norm for those that did not plan ahead.The restaurant has a limited wine list with mostly New World wines, all reasonably priced at the lower range of wine prices in Singapore, around S$60-S$100. We opted for a white New Zealand Giesen savignon blanc at S$70, which was served and chilled impeccably by our waiter. As a starter, we chose the calamari fritti. The dish was served a bit sparse on the plate, with two calamansi limes and marinara sauce. The calamari was tasty, although the plating was uninspired - a couple of pieces of parsley would have made a big difference in appearance.For mains we ordered a pasta and pizza, to split between two of us. We ordered a "Boscaiola" pizza, consisting of cheese, porcini mushrooms, and Italian sausage. For the pasta, we order the spaghetti vongole.The pizza was cooked to perfection - the bottom crust was crisp and dark brown, the product of a real Italian pizza oven. The toppings were very tasty and generous. To be sure, the pizza is Italian style, not a North American deep dish or thick crust pie.The vongole was pasta was cooked perfectly al dente with a lots of vongole clams mixed in. The dish was refreshing and an excellent complement to the pizza. For desert we opted for the tiramisu, tasty but not the best we have ever had. We also order espresso coffee which was served in demitasse cups and authentic. Our total bill came to S$168, including 10% service and 7% GST. The restaurant has both al fresco and indoor seating. Its very busy and bistro type, so ambiance is pizzeria and not quiet or private. Tables turn over fast and children are welcome.Overall, we enjoyed eating one of the most tastiest pizzas we have every had. Bella Pizza is highly recommended for a simple and satisfying pizza and pasta night out in Singapore
