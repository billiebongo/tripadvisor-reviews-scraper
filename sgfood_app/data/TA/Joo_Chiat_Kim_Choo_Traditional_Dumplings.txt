Dumplings are to die for, fillings on the dumplings are pretty substantial. Nonya kueh done the good old fashion way.

Really good selection of traditional Nyonya pastries. The glutinous rice dumplings are generously packed with filling and lovingly flavoured. A must stop for visitors looking for an authentic Nyonya experience.

I have bought from this outlet a few times and each time that lady collecting your money put me off. Whenever I start to ask questions about the kuehs, she would reluctantly reply me or give me non-replies, treating me as if I was her enemy. The first time it happened, I overlooked it and didn't think much about it. Then it happened again. And again!! So it wasn't my imagination. Just observe her the next time you have to be there and see if that's her problem!!As for me, I will not be going near her any more!! There are many places where one could get good nonyna kueh and be treated as a customer!! Besides, most of those colourful kueh have artificial (harmful?) colouring in them. They don't use natural colouring like those from blue flower, pandan leaves, etc any more!! All for fatter profit margins?

Shop located along Joo Chiat Place, next to Fei Fei Wanton Noodles (There's 2 Fei Fei Wanton Noodles on the same street).Beside dumplings they sell other Nonya pastries, curry puffs, cookies, etc. There are various types of dumplings (about $1.60 - $2.50). Usually no queue, unless nearing the dumpling festival (Lunar calendar 5th day of 5th month), the queue can be about 30-40 minutes and prices double and triple up.Nice food. No eat in. All to be taken away

We were doing our own family food tour around Joo Chiat area and these were the family favourite. Worth going out of your way to find. Wish there was a cooking school so we could learn how to make these once we get back to Australia. Chicken was our favourite flavour and I was a bit sad that they didn't have any chilli prawn when we visited
