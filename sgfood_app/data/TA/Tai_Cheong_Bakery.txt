Happened to pass by and decided to give it a try. Surprisingly the food is good especially the egg tart and coconut tart. Satisfied with the HK noodle which was served in dry instead of soup. Iced glass jelly slightly sweet but acceptable.We will come again

I do enjoy the hk cafe style food here but disappointed that they now charge service charge & GST. That aside, the char siew polo bun is my fave, best one I’ve had in sg, wish they served it warmed up Though $2.20++The egg tart is also the best hk style one in sg. Delicious flakey crumbling buttery crust and soft not overly sweet egg filling $1.90++I also had the macaroni chicken noodle soup this time $6.50. Not much chicken, no veg inside just noodle and some bits of chicken. It’s ok. I wish the staff would have informed me no rice dishes in the afternoon before I was ushered in. I had asked are they still serving meals.... and was told yes. But afternoons are only sandwiches and noodles I think. I actually like the charsiew rice there. Too bad. Drinks (hot) are $2.50++, not as flavorful as real ones I’ve had in hk.. I’d give it a miss...

Nestled in Holland Village, this Hong Kong bakery outlet in Singapore offers a simple outlet with excellent food and even better service. We went for brunch and were impressed with an amazing Scrambled Eggs on toast (traditional white only). Never had such different Scrambled Eggs before. Just nicely wet, perfectly textured and held together like an omlette. The Egg Tarts were outstanding, possibly inspired by the Macau / Portuguese origins. Even got four of them to have with evening tea. Even though I asked for the toast to be toasted brown, it came almost white and untoasted. When I ordered a second round, I asked the server to be more mindful. To my pleasant surprise, he brought a well toasted piece in replacement, with an apology. I was delighted.

The dining experience brought me back to HK. The only thing that I didn’t like was that you had to share tables. It’s ok if it wasn’t bench seats. I enjoyed the durian & cheese tart so much I decided to buy all the tarts back. They were a bit pricey ($1.90-3.60) but totally worth your money. Reheating instructions were 200 degrees for 5 minutes but it was still cold inside. I put it back for another 5 minutes

Happened to pass by HV, so we had early lunch at this restaurant. Typical Hong Kong cuisine like egg tarts, toast, bun, curry rice etc.Price wise, not cheap. For French toast approx $6+, bun $2+, yuan Yang tea $2+Food wise, yummy!Do give it a try

Went there on a Sunday around 9.45am, we ordered few egg tarts, durian and cheese tart, the famous Hongkong style bun, chiffon cake, chicken cutlet with toast and egg, toast with beef and egg, bun with luncheon meat strips plus tea, yin yang for a group of 11. The above orders were good though we have a change of serving staff as they do not know their service and their ware well enough. One said we can order anything on the menu, and then was told that they will serve the 'breakfast' item and not noodle and main dishes. They got our order mix up so a 3rd waiter came and finally we placed order and have our breakfast by 10.30am. The serving standard differs from 1 staff to the other. We ordered 6 tarts and they came in 1 plate but did not give us small serving plate so the kids dropped half of the tarts onto the table and floor. The next table ordered 2 tarts for 2 adults, it was served 1 tart per plate. As the adults in our group want to try the noodle, so we waited till 11am to place order for 1 portion of beef rice, 3 portions of instant noodle with a mixture of curried fish ball, braised squids and chicken wings, 2 portions of braised squids for side dish, and we were totally disappointed - everything is cold or i should say room temperature, and you wonder why you are paying so much for simple food with no taste - or i should put it as 'ordinary' - this is place definitely not worth going but okay for their buns and egg tarts

They have the HK feel down to a pat- the mosaic floor, the booth seats and the Cantonese pop music with the heavy bass. Have had takeaway several times but this is my first time dining in. Egg tart was delicate and delicious, chiffon cake was a little dry and honey lemon drink was acceptable. Service was good despite the rainy day crowd.

Tips: please check your order before leaving the cafe.I did quick visit on 19th August, Saturday afternoon for take away. I ordered and paid 5 egg tarts and 1 chicken pie. During ordering, the lady told me their box only can fit for 4 egg tart, and she said she would put the other 1 of egg tart and 1 chicken pie inside paper bag. Which I agreed and she told to the cashier what my order was. So I moved to cashier, while the lady packed my egg tarts & chicken pie. The cashier lady charged me 5 egg tarts and 1 chicken pie too. Too my surprised, when I reached home, we realised there was 1 missing egg tart. It only had 1 box of egg tart (4 pieces inside), and 1 chicken pie inside paper bag.I felt cheated, I can't imagine if they do this 5-10 times a day, they can get free money $9.5-19.5 a day

Wanted to try something different than the regular bars and restaurants in Holland Village. Unfortunately this was not the best choice. Lots of fatty foods, somewhat tasty. The tarts and the other sweets are definitely great. The main courses not so much. I will not return

Egg tart is good and other side pastries too ! should goes well with the HK style milktea or coffee.

and i liked the egg and chicken too!
Tuck in the middle of Holland village it is a nice and low key restaurant.
Stash is very friendly
Will come again

Located in the once trendy Holland V, Tai Cheong is a quintessential HK style bakery and canteen that serves unique HK style fast food and snacks for coffee and tea. The highlights are the fantastic egg tarts, best enjoyed when it is hot out of oven. The fast food menu is less interesting and requires a acquired taste

Came here for lunch one weekend to understand what the rage with the bakery was. We have previously tried the egg tarts in hong kong, so was keen to try the main dishes as well and they turned out all to be above average and good value-for-money given that the bakery currently does not charge any service charge or additional GST as well. The egg tarts was also of a good quality but i wouldn't queue hours for them. Overall a pleasant experience as long as you can go on a day that doesn't have a long queue

I have tried the ones in HK before. I have to say I really like and prefer the egg tart crust here. Crispy, lovely balance of butter and sugar in the dough and the custard is not overly sweet. Just right for me. Those who buy home should consume immediately. I took away a couple of times but the egg tarts turned soft due to the moisture despite the boxes having several holes to prevent that. They were not as nice already. Perhaps the management should relook into that. I would also recommend the coconut tart too. I like that the centre of the filling was still moist when eaten. The Chicken Chop with Scrambled Eggs Toast was a value-for-money brunch item that I would order on my next visit. The chicken was crispy on the outside, while the meat was tender. However, the kitchen should have been more generous with the sauce given the portion size. Loved the French toast too! To be honest, the prices are decent and affordable for the food and services as compared to other cafes selling brunch items that can be really expensive. It's a relatively small place so you might have to wait in the queue before being seated. All in all, I would come back again for sure!

This is a very famous egg tart bakery from Hong Kong and famous for its innovation snacks. I had it before in Hong Kong and today decide to bring my family to enjoy the breakfast together. The restaurant had just update the breakfast menu. Almost all the set now come with a polo bun. Firstly, even with no crowd, the service is slow. It took more than 25min before the food is served. I can wait for good food however, the food is really not worth its price. Secondly, the chicken chop is way too salty and even the scrambled egg are salty as well. Per set is close to about S$10 bucks. The egg tarts still remains delicious I would recommend just stick to the egg tarts.

Yesterday, I happened to be at Holland Village and I remember this egg tart. I described to my Friend on this lovely n yummy egg tart and we speed up our steps; hopping there won't be a Long Q. It was 4pm.There wasn't a Long Queue.We were happy to have our tarts home. My Friend said she loves it and her first time trying it out! Will be back for more whenever my tarty crave comes

Was excited to come here as I haven't been to HK in a while n was missing the diner experience.All the rice dishes were sold out that day, so we had two toast dishes and buns and egg tarts. The toast dishes had way too much butter for me, to be honest. Charsiew bolo bao was not as good as I had hoped, but egg tarts were yummy!Service was a spotty, we had a lil trouble flagging down staff to take our orders, they all seemed in the middle of a task all the time.Was fun for the novelty of it, but I don't think I'll be back soon

Fresh from the oven. the egg custard is smooth and soft. The crust was not the usual layered crust, but more of a pastry kind of crust. Not too sweet, melts almost instantly in your mouth. Surprisingly the queue was barely even there around 9pm and we got our box of egg tarts in less than a minute. It sells for $1.90 each. 4 of them to pack into a small box.Egg tarts started to grow moles over the night if left outside at room temperature, so if you're saving it for tomorrow, make sure to keep it refrigerated

ServiceThe staff and the cashier are polite and attentive . They are not exactly warm but it is just the way I like it . Ambience There is an air con dining area and an outdoor area. The indoor area was full , so I was seated outdoor . After the rain , the temperature was comfortable . The tables outside were placed way too near to one another . Even how they spaced their tables is authentically HK. FoodThe dishes which I had while dining in were competent . They are not overly seasoned with MSG , something I like . Taste wise, the food was authentically Hong Kong . I would rate it as slightly above average . Egg TartThe egg tart is the obviously the star of the brand . It tasted oh-so-good . It maintained the quality and taste of the Tai Cheong Egg Tart I had at Central, Hong Kong Island . It was delicious ! I like it very much . There is a counter to purchase egg tarts at the entrance. Price The prices were very reasonable . My son and I ordered 2 dishes and 2 drinks . The bill came up to be around S$24. There was no service charge. Conclusion I will DEFINITELY come back for the delicious Tai Cheong Egg Tart !

Initially, when I first had the egg tart, it's really really nice. After the 2nd and 3rd times of purchase with about 2-3 weeks interval, it is no longer nice as per the 1st time I tried.

Our first time having lunch here, the food is good. And the must try is the delicious famous Hong Kong egg tarts.

We came here to try their famous HK egg tart. The crust of the tart was very soft and the filling on top was light yet tasty.
Definitely one of the best egg tarts ever.

Queue is much shorter now. Have to be prepared to share a 4seater sofa table with others. But it is much more spacious as compared to most other crampy dim sum stalls here. Egg tarts still as good. Prices stated are nett

bought some chicken pie as they were clearing and there was no queue. the one at Taka often has super long queue. I do like the chicken pie but I have tasted nicer ones.
4
Queued for quite long but overall experience was great! LOVED their Po Lo bun & Egg tarts! Will go back for these again!
4
Even with t queue, the food is worth the wait. Though servers are busy, they are personable. Thumbs to them.The food and pastries are worth every cent. Must try is the baolo bun; warm and fragrAnt.The coconut tart is my personal favourite; the taste is rich but not overpowering

There are more exciting Chinese cuisines out there these days, but sometimes all you want is a good old-fashioned Hong Kong feed. That’s when you head to Tai Cheong Café. Tucked away in Holland Village, Tai Cheong Cafe is really a cha chaan teng.Their three coloured silky egg rice are the ones to go for here, with plenty of egg to temper the rich flavours and their egg tarts also always hit the spot. I come here only for this. The others on the menu isn’t as good.I can’t say Tai Cheong Cafe gets everything right, or that it’s a Hong Kong diner destination, but I’ll stand behind this humble—and quite cheap eatery. This is the true truth as I say it as it is

Have been to this restaurant several times. There have a common queue to purchase bakery and another queue for lunch. Their 3eggs rice was delicious. Not bad on the drinks. Many people patronize this outlet as No service nor GST. Value for money and must try.

Was curious to try it after reading about it. Had their famous egg tarts both in SG and hk. Have not tried their tea house 茶餐厅 before . The location is easy to find at holland village. More casual dining. Went after lunch hour peak. Around 130pm. The waitress was nice enough to ask me if I'd like to sit inside or outside. But when I said inside, she promptly told me there was no seat inside. Hmm... Then why ask? SOP to go through the motion?Anyway, I ordered my usual fave yuan yang (milk coffee plus tea), a butter polo bun & this dish I never had before - smooth egg omelette with 2 types of meats over rice - I chose BBQ pork charsiew and prawn. The tea was disappointing. Weak tea. Not creamy and thick like those in hk. $2.50. Hmm...The polo bun, $2.20 I didn't like that it was put in a casing. It was useless and spoilt the whole experience. The bun was stuck to the casing. And I couldn't eat the bun without ripping it out of the casing. Then when removing the bun from the casing, the top crust crumbled everywhere. It was an " AW, MAN!!" moment for me. Best part is the crust right?!The bun tasted ok. Soft, slightly warm. With a nice slab of cold butter which slowly melted into the bun. Seriously could do without the useless casing. The omelette rice was interesting. Never had it before. It had some BBQ meat sauce drizzled over it. Kinda sweet and savory. Not had. I liked the BBQ pork. It's the honey BBQ brown type of hk charsiew which I prefer, unlike the red colored ones local charsiew looks like. For $9.90 it was ok. Portion size quite large. But it was strange my rice was served before my bun. It got cold while I was trying to tackle my bun. That, i didn't like. This place doesn't charge GST or service charge which is quite nice. A little irked over the numerous places which charge but don't provide service anyway. The food is average but I wouldn't mind going back again some time for a taste of hk when I miss it.
