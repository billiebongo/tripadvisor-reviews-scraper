This was my 2nd visit to this lovely Halal restaurant to try more of its wide offering.We ordered the Iceberg Kopi (vanila ice cream in local black coffee) again! Really glad that coffee was thick, smooth & fragrant like our 1st visit.The crisp you tiao (flour fritters) went very well with the strong curry chicken. So was the French loaf which we soaked up every drop of the curry gravy!The restaurant did a great job with a sinful snack that had proven to be very addictive. Instead of the usual salmon fish skin, Ah Tong used chicken skin! Yes chicken skin that was sliced razer thin & deep fried. It tasted wonderful with the belachan chilli.We also ordered from the Western menu which did not disappoint. The seafood marinara was filled with fresh squid, fish & prawns in flavourful tomato sauce. Spaghetti was al dente making the entire dish very satisfying.Last but not least was the Ginger Lemongrass drink that helped to put out the fire from the curry chicken. Very refreshing!We will be going back soon as we have only tasted 10% of the entire menu!Highly recommended for family with kids especially with nearby prawning ponds, beautiful park & children rides.

Just as the heading suggest. The food is average. Pricing is just average. The only reason why I am dining there is due to proximity from where I stay. Otherwise if I am staying out of this area I don't think anyone would travel down just to have a meal there. Nothing to complain, it's just average

I was there with my family on the 8th of October, for dinner. We order a lot of food to try out. really a lot of food. And amazingly, the food turn out to be fantastic and delicious, the prices are cheap and also the serving was huge. I was so happy having dinner there with my family. Their services, never superb and tip top. I would really want to compliment Mr Dave, the elderly guy, he was so polite, he was friendly, he was so good, and quite entertaining. Not forgetting the rest of the staff also, all of them was fast in getting the job done and they are all quite helpful actually with whatever we requested. Would like to comment also, a young chap, wearing specs at the cashier counter, which was very friendly and very well mannered, didn't get his name. The place was well kept clean, and the aircon! Super cold! . Maybe because it was raining outside. Thank you for making our dinner a memorable one. I will come again very soon. as I stay nearby.

This is a growing residential area in Punggol and among the containers eating shop, Ah Dong is actually an affordable one besides Popeyes. We came after a walk and tried their carrot cake,fried chicken, chicken skin and pasta. Ginger lemongrass is nice for drink. For sure I prefer to eat here again when walk or cycling around Punggol.

A friend brought me and a few others here for lunch. The fried chicken skin was awesome.I had the waffle chicken sandwich. I was taken aback to the thickness of it. It was simply delicious. Would have tasted better if there was some sauce to go with it i think.A friend also ordered condensed milk waffle. Oh my gosh! I loved it!The rest of my friends enjoyed their lunch too. They practically cleaned their plate of food

Ah Dong Tea house is located at Punggol East Water Promenade Riverside Walk. There is ample carpark with many other family restaurants and pubs around. The jogging n Cycling tracks are just besides the canal leading to the Punggol water. Tried the pasta, baked rice n grilled fish. Will give it a 8/10 rating! A cup of coffee is $2.50 n a cup of coffee with ice cream is also $2.50! What would be your order then

We went to punggol to take a walk and chance upon this cafe. The cafe located is a bit out skirt and easily accessible for people driving. We saw a queue to this cafe and decided to try, the waiting time is fast. We have order half chicken and fried mushroom. The waiting time is not too long, the half chicken consist of half spring chicken, 2 kampong chicken wings, baked rice and salad, a very big portion at a good price. The kampong chicken wing especially is crispy and tender, the spring chicken is a bit dry though, we have shared the platter for 2 person. Highly recommended to try if you ever go to punggol settlement
