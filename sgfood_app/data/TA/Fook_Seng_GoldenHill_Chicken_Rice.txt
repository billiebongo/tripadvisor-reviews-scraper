Don't know if this is the best chicken rice around, but this is the best that I have ever had. An absolute steal at a few bucks a plate. And the chili sauce is every bit as good as the owners claim.

We visited Singapore for the weekend and were brought here by the family of a friend who is from Singapore. They are real foodies and absolutely swear by Fook Seng when it comes to Chicken Rice. They clearly focus on what is important, juicy chicken and delicious rice that soaks up the plethora of sweet chilli, garlic and soy reduction sauces that are on offer. Ladle on a few vegetables and you're in clover.The owner was an exceptionally chap, in a lovely neighbourhood, we will absolutely be returning here

One of my favourite stalls when I was younger and stumbled upon them again with my kids one Sunday. Steamed chicken so soft an succulent, cooked to perfection with the rice so fragrant yet not too oily. The chilli and ginger is one potent combination. Run by Ronnie and a family owned outfit, he is always ready to smile and tell you he is cooking in his style. Makan lost and found should feature them but I beat them to it! Anyone who wants to really enjoy Chicken rice, you must try them out. Two thumbs up and die die must try! The next door noodles from Mingfa is also great if you need the Laksa or Bak Chor Mee fix. Just brought a large team of my colleagues over to taste it to believe it. Thanks for making me fall in love with chicken rice again. Feel kind of sad now that I know a queue will form the next time I go. LoL

After trying other chicken rice, me and my husband both agree that they serve the best. The owner Ronnie said, it is the chopping that makes a great difference, so he does it personally. The rice taht goes with the chicken is also perfectly cooked. Good that he moved to a bigger location

Very good and cheap chicen rice, bit on the oily side but hey why eat chicken rice if you don't enjoy the fat juicy skin?! Also sells porridge and raw fish....have not tried the raw fish but seemed really popular, porridge not as fantastic as the chicken rice. Bit difficult to find though tucked away deep in a very quiet housing estat

Fook Seng GoldenHill Chicken Rice37 Jalan Rumah Tinggi, #01-429 SingaporeNow this is a chicken rice place worth trying. The chicken is tender, tasty, with a very light touch of sesame oil– unusual innovation in chicken rice. The rice is just right with a tiny bit of oiliness and flagrant. The price is right too, two of us spent about S$10.00 for chicken rice and a small plate of sauté bokchoy. The place is a real hole-in-the-wall, complete with outside seating, plastic bucket dishwashing, Melmac dishes, and is located in a street storefront of an unremarkable, almost drab apartment block far from anything. But, boy, is the food worth the trip

Another great place to eat the famous hainanese chicken rice! The chicken is soo juicy, tender and tasty. The rice is full of flavor.The only downside is its location - Blk 37 Jalan Rumah Tinggi - which is not very accessible. But it's worth the trip
