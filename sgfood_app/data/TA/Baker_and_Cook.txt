Disappointed. I ordered a coffee and toast. The coffee tasted terrible. The bread had a nice flavour, but it was presented on the plate as limp bread - not toasted. A waste of $10 with other great cafes in town.

I would highly recommend the onion and sesame bagel with cream cheese and the chocolate and almond croissant. The service staff is nice and everything is freshly made.

Freshly prepared meals but average tasting. Eggs Benedict is average and overpriced. Service varies from disinterested to poor. A total rip off. The only positive thing I can say is it's open beyond 2 pm if you need to grab a late lunch.

Went there for breakfast Very good cakes such as cheese cake and carrot cake but coffees can be improved

I occasionally eat at Baker and Cock.
The food is excellent quality. Just watch out for busy periods as they can forget orders and are generally unapologetic about it too.

Very crowded Saturday morning !! Had to wait to get to the counter and take away !! Delicious smell of baked products - heavenly taste !Croissants a bit different than the softer ones that we are used to. Worth a try . Hardly any place to sit !Decided to go in and take away

We went to the one in Holland Village. It was busy and thankfully we did not have to wait for a table.The bread and pastries here are freshly baked daily. Had the croissant and danish pastries while waiting for our meal.The eggs Benedict with crispy bacon and salmon were just awesome and so was the avocado tartine. Coffee was good...just nice and not to bitter or sour.They have a wide selection of wine too.A very cosy cafe serving good quality food and coffee. Lovely.They are pet friendly too. Seating for those with pets were seated outside. Definitely more visits to come.

Nestled in a rustic neighbourhood just a stone throw from the busy streets of Holland Village, the environment here throws you into a calm and almost laid back feel. Great place to hangout and chat over coffee, and let time slowly trickle away.Service wise, a little haphazard, but a little patience works wonder. Food wise, the aroma of freshly baked breads, pies and coffee gives you that warm fuzzy feel. From sourdough rye to wholemeal, the range of breads are pretty decent. Pies and salads are a little limited in range, but they do taste quite good. Almost always busy as the flow of customers seem constant. Not a very big place, but that just adds coziness

Went there for lunch and had the Raw Energy Salad. Really tasty and freshly made. The salad had grated carrots and red beets with tons of pumpkin seeds and juicy raisins. The portion was very generous, was really pleasantly surprised. Coffee was very nice as well. The sourdough bread was ok but nothing out of the ordinary. Overall good value for money. Holland Village outlet was very crowded at lunch time

Baker and cook is one of my favourite places for weekend breakfast/brunch. The place is located at a quite location. My favourite is the cheese twist bread and cappuccino. Also the savoury french toast is a delight. The staff are a bit clumsy as they will usually not take care to clean the leftovers unless I ask. Overall a very good place to spend a relaxed weekend morning

Coffee is one of the best in Singapore - been 3 days in a row to get my morning fix. The staff are friendly and always cheerful - love it
5
Great coffee! with a side of brownie bite.
the aroma from the assorted pastries and bread will make you hungry!
Not noisy and crowded so ideal for conversations/discussions/dates!

Observed Lizards at the restaurant. Staff was also drinking coffee in front of the guests. Cheesecake was floury, fruit tart pastry too thick.
5
Stopped by the Bedok branch for a late brunch. The staff were super friendly and helpful and the food really good. I would definitely recommend the eggs benedict! The bread, cakes and pastries all looked very good but I was to stuffed to try them.
4
Great bakery worth a visit for pastries and desserts. They also serve good coffee and natural minute made juices.
5
This is a neighborhood gem. Their fresh bread is amazing, as well as their pastries, cakes and pies. We go about once or twice a week for bread and also have a lunch of a savory pie with a salad. The Thai Curry Chicken is one of our favorites with the Raw Energy salad.

I came hungry, super excited for the eggs benedict, but I have left extremely disappointed. It looked amazing, until I sliced open the poached egg and egg white spilled all over the bread and bacon. I tried the second poached egg and it was even worse. Left hungry and unsatisfied, I ordered a bagel to-go. I've just opened the box (see picture) to find that I'd been given a bagel with a cube of cream cheese on the side but no knife?! Thanks, Baker and Cook, I'll use my finger I guess

Lovely artisinal bread and delicious salads served with really good coffee. Shame about the service staff though. They always seem like they are forced to work here. Never a smile from them. Cool neighbourhood place to sit and while the time away. Good salads are difficult to find in SIngapore. This establishment does make good salads. Wish their portions were slightly bigger
3
I'd give this a 4 star but for the fact that the queues can be terrible and the clientele is just a little bit too pleased with itself. The Eggs Benedict is decent, but the customers, expats and locals alike, are just a bit too smug, moneyed, and keen to be seen. Just my view of course. You can have a nice breakfast here, but you may as well be anywhere in the world - this isn't really Singapore; it's 'happy valley'.

I regularly pop into a few of the Baker and Cook branches for coffee. The bread and cakes for take away are regularly hit or miss whether you get nice soft bread or something that is stale and bin-worthy. The lovely display cabinets mean that the food is left in the air conditioning to dry out. I asked if the quick was microwaved and i was repeatedly told that it was done in an oven and they do not microwave things. Upon googling it i can confirm that the "oven" that they use is in fact microwaving the food, I understand that its a common practice but if i specifically ask and am repeatedly told that its not microwave then I am not happy.
4
On the whole the venue and food is nice, the eggs Benedict is an absolute must, full of flavour. I like the decor, the interiors are well furnished and modern. The scrambled egg lacked and colour or taste, and was dry, avoid.
5
A friend took me here who lives in Singapore, really good coffee and yummy breakfast.
They have a great range of bread, biscuits and chutneys, jams etc. to take home as well. Highly recommended!!

Very good quality European breads. The French baguettes, German bread and English white loaf all available. It is a bit costly, so it is a treat to go there and get the olive bread, it is exceptional. 👍👍
4
Good ambience but can get very crowded on weekends. I would recommend the quiche and pecan tart. The flourless chocolate cookies were not nice. Coffee was all right. Outdoor seating would be good for those who brought their pets.

If you are in the area this is an ideal place for a brunch, or a casual coffee, friendly efficient staff. What really makes a difference is their bread, I have developed an addiction to their Danish Rye Bread, which surely must be the best you can get east of Greater Copenhagen! Try it
5
Good coffee, good food.... That's pretty much it.Yup, they serve a wide variety of breads, pastries, pies, salads, etc... their eggs benedict with salmon is my favourite. Tried this at many places but by far i feel theirs is the best. Their coffee is also prepared with love, really good coffee

This is my first time at Baker & Cook at Chip Bee Gardens and I am very disappointed.Bought myself a slice of carrot cake which the staff packed into a box for take away. When I arrived in my office, hoping to have a good tea break, I sighted a strand of hair sticking out from the carrot cake.Immediately disgusted, I threw the cake away. Hope this is a once-off incident and do hope that the management looked into the food handling of the counter staff. Else I thought the ambience of the cafe is pretty chill for a chat with friends though o didn't get to stay at least this time.

Had a quick lunch yesterday late afternoon at Baker & Cook. I had the steak pie based on the recommendation of the staff. While I love the flakiness of the pastry, the meat filing is way too salty. The pasta salad I chose was also a bit hard. Great service though from the young chap bringing me my food and who went out of his way to get me water. (Never occurred to me to get his name)

I am always on the hunt for good quality coffee.The coffee here is okay... Not the best I've had, it was however a bit strange for me to learn that two members of staff could not tell me where the coffee is from, nothing about the roasting of the beans. This should have given me some indication perhaps they don't pride themselves on good coffee.I think it's a better choice to buy freshly baked breads from there. Would not go back in a rush.
4
Deserves 5 stars for their outstanding loaves of bread, but just 3 stars for their cakes, salads, sandwiches and coffee which are average. Highly recommended if you want to grab some bread to take away.

Foods tried were the salads, a quiche and a bagel.
They were very tasty and of a decent portion - quite worth the prices paid. B&C also had a charming atmosphere.
The staff on duty were not really friendly, nor customer-oriented.

A pleasant surprise in Holland village. Sourdough bread, fresh healthy salads, lots of cakes. Good coffee. Nice atmosphere. Did I meantion great selection of freshly baked bread?

Good coffee, good food, good value for money :). They also have a good range of breads and pastries available to take home

Baker & Cook is well-known for their breads, cakes, pastries, quiches and salads. While the spread of food offered doesn't make it the best place for dinner (people normally patronise it for brunch), the small crowd in the evenings makes an ideal place for a catch-up session. The small seating areas, low ceilings, and warm hues of lighting makes it a nice chill-out location. Perfect for a lazy evening with a cuppa in hand. :)I ordered a set meal, complete with choice of quiche/ tart and a choice of salad. ($10.50)The crust of the Salmon quiche was sufficiently crumbly and delightful. They were pretty generous with the tasty salmon bits. Capsicum slices were tucked within the quiche and they gave it a refreshing crunch with every bite. Their quiche wasn't as cheesy as expected (a bummer for a cheese lover like me), but I suppose it would sit well with others who aren't fans of cheesy food.I thought the couscous salad had a cute and unique name, so I ordered it as a side with my quiche on a whim. It was fine and grainy, with apricot chunks. It reminded me of baby food, and I found the sweet-salty taste of the salad slightly strange... Guess it would be my first and last time ordering that salad. Next time I'll just safely stick to the greens.There was a water dispenser by the side of the cafe, and a tray of samples with dips on the counter (which was sadly depleted when we went.) I appreciate it when cafes provide water free-of-charge. It's so much better than places that charge you for a glass of plain tap water. (URGH.)Overall, it was a nice experience and I loved the ambience there. The brunch menu looked amazing but wasn't available at the time that we went. Perhaps I would return for their brunch sometime soon. :

Xmas was herald in early for us when we ordered the turkey ham mushroom cheese topped with jam and pomegranates - a fusion of sweet and savory pizza and it was delicious.The big thin smoked salmon slices blend well with small prawns scattered amidst the pieces of mozzarella.We had it at Swan Lake branch and it was a warm light dinner with vanilla puff and walnut bread with a lager beer.Service is attentive as they specially warm the bread for us and enquiried whether everything is fine.A good relaxing place for residents

My search for good coffee and a good breakfast place is a never ending journey in Singapore. This place on balance delivers. A few tweaks on the service and it would be a stand out as the coffee and bakery items are fab and the whole set up is very nice
4
The food was tasty as was the smoothies and tea and apparently coffee is good too. Eggs benedict with no hollandise was sublime, would have loved to have tried their pastries which looked lovely.The place isn't a great business venue though as it's full of women who clearly spend a good proportion of their day there. Alright for some!, the rest of us have to work...

Have visited on several occasions with friends for lunch as Baker and Cook caters to more specific needs - vegetarian, gluten intolerant, as well as ordinary folk. Great bread, salads, omelette, pastries, coffees and so on with friendly service. But to my mind, a little over-priced when it comes to the size of your meal. Very much appreciate the quality and the freshness of the food, but it comes at a price. Sitting indoors is rather noisy, but room for all the family and friends. Advise booking a table if you can at busy periods

Friends and I were looking for a place that would be open early for us to meet and have breakfast, as one of had to rush off to work after that. This was one of the places that's open by 8am on a weekday. Since it was my first time there, I went expecting to order breakfast set with eggs, toast, sausages, and maybe sautÃ©ed mushrooms? But they didn't really have breakfast sets of this sort.. It was more like pancakes.. Or toast.. Or eggs. All kinda separate. So I ended up ordering a bacon and mushroom tart (it's kinda like the quiche) which they heated up before serving. And it came with a side salad. I chose the tomato feta cheese one - yummy! And topped it off with a latte. Cost me $16. ($11 + $5). I should be back again some time! The place got really crowded around 9am plus when we were about to leave. (Gosh, don't these people need to work?! )
