Went there to celebrate a friend's birthday last Saturday. Prices are affordable and reasonable. Diners can choose the steak from 2 different sizes and pay according to the size they ordered. Staff are friendly.

Was craving for steak and this restaurant provides steak at resonable price. Never fail to disappoint with the price you are paying. Should always top up to get the soup and drink.

Prices at the restaurant was reasonable and acceptable for the food they offered. Just the environment may not be that pleasant due to the big crowd along the corridor.

The restaurant was hidden at a corner of the mall and thus was not very noisy. The food are of acceptable standard with choice of side dishes. Staff are friendly and service was prompt.

Went to the bedok branch which was recently opened on a Tuesday evening for dinner. There was a decent crowd. However, I found the food was average. Apparently the chicken was almost tasteless. Onion rings was cold and so called must try root beer was just average.. top sweet compared to other places.

Went there for weekday set lunch. Tried the fish and chips, comes with 2 side dish, taste not bad but the fish a bit dry, but with the price paid, it is considered reasonable. The set meal cost 10.90++, with soup + garlic bread and drinks.

Finally went in, but after the trip, won't be the last. Found value in their meals, and some memories as well. Been a long time since having an A&W root beer float and found it here, done the old fashion way. Just too bad there is no more A&W root beer on tap. Food wise, up to what I had to pay, and given a little more. Mac and Cheese tasted much better than many places, but Sirlion steak was only on par. Would be back to try more of their fare

Tried it out for a casual dinner with my family. This is a fairly new outlet in Djitsun Mall near MRT station.Loved the food and flavors at this cafe and grill !!! Tonite we ordered well cooked Dory Fish & chips and Grilled chicken with baked rice & coleslaw.Pretty affordable too!Will definitely be back soon

Have dinner at the place. Price was reasonable and food was okay by the price. What they need to do is to focus on the order. We ordered a medium done and well done steak but what come to us was 2 medium done steaks. As my wife was hungry, we didn't bother to change it. So next time we will be more careful there

You look outside you think eh look like hard rock but not very rock. But ah, you don't see this place no up ok. I went there waiter/waitresses all look very geena young young, but ah seh, I order 2 beers, 2 steaks plus extra fries on the side, the Malay boy very smart know how to recommend, suggest I order bucket instead cos cheaper PLUS get fries free (think this one no more offer liao). Hosay la!! Even my Wife who normally nag me for drinking too much say OK. I jackpot kena drink 3.5 bottles she only drink 1.5. Shiokadoos!The NY steak we order medium rare but came too rare I poke still got hear a soft "mooooo", so send back. Don't worry they very helpful confirm redo for you second Sui Sui one. The steak damn shiok for the price, confirm plus guarantee chop worth it.Only one Indian waitress she a bit blur when taking our order, maybe new, but need more training only cos she was very polite. If got 3.7, I give 3.7, but TripAdvisor why you no give point point one! So only give 3. Will come back and give another chance cos experience was good. Keep on improving Buddysssssss
