Main dishes were nice. The buffets spread was little and too crowded. Area too small. Should have more space to move around
5
Quiet and nice environment for dinning. Good spread of main dishes and semi buffet. Staffs are friendly and fun. The environment is pretty much like a fine dinning
4
Pleasant and warm service. Good selection at the appetizer buffet, but unfortunately food wasn’t always replenished. Wide choice of mains and the Laksa is highly recommended- comes with succulent scallops and even cockles (optional)! Waiting to return to try the other mains!

This place serves semi-buffet dinner. Appetizers and desserts are freeflow. Seclect one main course from the menu. I had the paper wrapped seafood. It was good. The highlight was theappetizers for me. Very good spread.
4
Ample selection of mains to order from but dessert selection is rather limited. Could be better if they enhance their dessert spread.

I always feel like home when I have lunch at One Ninety. The staff are super attentive and friendly. Food is healthy and yummy.

Loved the variety of entrees offered together with the semi buffer lunch. Value for money to opt for the entree. Food is good. Ambience cosy.

Just tried their semi buffet dinner. I felt that some of the options on the menu are quite overpriced. So appetisers and desserts are buffet and you select an entree. First of it is split into 3 segments, Italian, Local and Western. Italian has the typical pasta fare but top up S$10 for the braised lamb shank which is tender and excellent. Local has items like Hainanese Chicken Rice, Laksa, Char Kway Teow. S$64++ for local fare is not for locals I reckon =). The western has items like spring chicken and for top up of S$32 you can go for the wagyu ribeye, Maine lobster. The buffet has the traditional appetisers like sushi, roasted duck, pork belly, salads, cheeses etc. Desserts has cakes and sweet items. A little overpriced but the service and quality of food is excellent

We went for Sunday Brunch, and we were happy that we were able to get a reservation on the same day. As the restaurant was helm by Giovanni Speciale, we were of the impression that the good will be at least competent to great. My son order the Maine Lobster, and I order the Wagyu Ribeye steak. I ask the steak to be cook medium rare. To my horror, the steak came out medium well on almost 2/3 of the steak. The only remaining eatable portion is between medium to medium rare. Hence the instruction given to the chef must have been correct, as I still receive 1/3 of the steak in medium rare. It is almost like eating leather on 2/3 of the steak a real disappointment on the Chef.The Maine lobster is good, and the rest of the stuff was ok as well. But I'm wondering how can a competent chef do not know how to cook a good quality steak, so I'm giving it 2 stars
4
Went for lunch. Generally good service. Quality ingredients used for buffet. We were mostly delighted. Wish they had included a soup in their buffet. Would have been perfect. Desserts appear to have been improved upon. Oh, the appetizer buffet has a significant western slant. So there were a few things I didn't bother to try as I don't like them....cheeses for example. But what remained was interesting enough. DÃ©cor could be "brighter".

Always great dining experience here with friendly service. Perhaps been better in terms of table location
4
Grill at its best! they have this great griller oven that dishes great grills. Wish they had pork chops in their menu. It'll add a wonderful item to meet our "total experience"

Went for dinner with the family. It's a semi buffet where the appetisers and desserts are on a buffet table spread and you order a main course from a menu. The range of mains is wide and the overall quality of food is very good. Salads were very fresh and desserts were thoughtfully prepared. the main standout was the service and Id like to highlight specifically a young man called Arvin, who was especially attentive over the evening and very personable going out of his way to offer suggestions and to come back periodically to see how we were doing. More restaurants should have staff like that. It'd make customers want to return. Recommended
4
One-Ninety has got it all - great ambience (cosy lighting, huge chandeliers and warm service through and through), posh factor, great curated smorgasbord of semi buffet so filling you can doggy bag your main course. The selection is sufficient and the food was palatable . It's great value for lunch and afternoon away your brunch till you set your napkins down.

Service was good but it could be better. The staff were observant and removed the plates once we were done with the food. However, the table was not set-up properly; ie missing cutlery. Request to top up our cups with water was also not fulfilled. Our bill was not in order when presented. Most typical restaurants would not be that careless.Wagyu rib-eye was a little bit of disappointment. It was not flavourful, tasted bland and uneventful. The characteristic wagyu flavour was extremely weak and diluted. The beef was also not as fresh as it should have been. It could well be a defrosted wagyu rib-eye by all accounts.Side buffet spread was better, and that's probably the only item worthy of a 4-star

Great lunch buffet - quality ingredients/food not about quantity. Reasonably price. The negative aspect of this place was the ambiance is so-so, located in the basement dark corner of a nice hotel - not the best place to have such a place. Also the waitress dropped and broke/droped a glass filled with water all over me - glass shards all over the table/floor. Although helped us move to a new table, didnt really offer us any returning vouchers/discount - which is a bit shocking for a 5 star hotel / restaurant and just unacceptable serviceI would return for the semi-lunch buffet however I do hope the staff would take into consideration the point above. Just cause the customers says they are ok with no injuries do not take the kindness for granted. I could have easily made it very dramatic and complained/make noise to management. I hope this will be rectify in the future for other customers Lastly the parking here is ludacris. 18$ for 2-3 hrs of parking. Thankfully the restaurant offers parking voucher - 50$ / voucher

When I arrived with my dining companions on weekday, we were greeted by friendly host. The cozy lighting, quiet and spaced out tables were perfect for business discussion. The restaurant is not too noisy. The layout of how food was displayed interesting with different appetizing colors for example black tomatoes is displayed next to bright colored cold cuts. They are simply eye pleasing. The varieties of appetizers are sufficient to keep me happy and satisfied. They have great selection of cheese, accompanied with a jar of pistachios, dried cranberries and honey. Rye Thin breads and bread sticks are the usual occupiers on this section. On salad bar, the greens are fresh, condiments provided include interesting Merlot dressing other than the usual caesar and balsamic dressing. I topped up my salad with roasted duck as the main protein. Surprisingly the ordinary looking roasted duck was flavourful. They marinated the duck well, each bite is tasty without any sauce required. Seafood salad was delish, large chunks of easy to peel lobster and crab claws were a draw to seafood lover. Moving on to cold cut sections, they have several types of ham. From Parma ham, shaved honey baked ham, iberico ham and the list still goes on. Love the rock melons, they are fresh and super sweet. Pairing it with Parma Ham is never wrong.There is also a selection of Mediterranean dishes like Baba Ganoush and couscous salad, Roasted zuchini and Ocra (Ladies Finger) salad.Make room for dessert, so many yummilicious tarts and cheese cakes to enjoy.They have green tea cheesecake, Bread pudding and so much more.One of the service staff on duty called Yuthana from Thailand was very prompt, friendly and helpful. He made the whole dining experience so pleasant with his professionalism. Kudos to the Four Season's training on staff service attitude. Would I come back again for meal there? Definitely

My wife and I dined here for lunch on Saturday and dinner on Friday. The food was good, but we felt that they could have rotated most of their buffet items instead. 80% of what was served for lunch was served for dinner. This might prevent repeated diners from coming regularly due to lack of new items
4
We had the semi-buffet and main for lunch at $52 ++. We got 50% off with the Amex platinum card. The semi buffet had a good selection of ham, salad, cheese, grilled vegetables and seafood. The dessert selection though small, they tasted good. There was a good selection of cakes, bread pudding, and fruits. For mains, there were a lot of choices from italian, asian and grilled. We had the tuna and prawns from the grilled section. The service was friendly and ambience was great.

Had a hugely satisfying dinner last night @One ninety restaurant. Tried their Semi Buffet which include a main course and a spread of appetizers and desserts to choose from. 1. The buffet spread isn't the most exciting, but offers unique dishes. Definitely not your usual salad buffet. 2. They have a limited time only chilli crab promotion which we can choose for the main course. Of course, for the 1kg worth of crab,there is an additional cost of $38 in addition to the $64 semi buffet set. The chilli crab sauce is fantastic. Better than Jumbo in our opinion. Very flavourful and spicy. Sufficient sauce was given and comes with fried buns to dip the sauce the traditional way. It's nice of them to give us additional buns after witnessing how much we enjoyed the dish.3. We ordered the cod fish in soy sauce (+$8) for the other main course. Cooked just the way I would like it to be. 4. Kudos to the wonderful staff they have in the restaurant. Very attentive to the slightest of needs we have. From topping up of our drinks to serving new plates for us and offering additional buns. A shout out to the staff (Chinese bespectacled staff) that served us, didn't manage to get his name though. But he's certainly top notch.

I find it strange that a high end restaurant will leave the box around. Maybe it's the Rolls Royce of biscuits but the the presentation leaves much to be desired. On the plus side, the wait staff were v attentive and warm.
5
The Chef whips out one of the best Risotto I have ever had in my life! Worth every single dollar. Great place to chill on the outdoor with a cigar in hand.

Tried their buffet lunch on a weekday.
Food is ok. Although the selection is small, but quality is good.
Nice ambience too. Service is ok.
5
Excellent buffet, sensible in variety and laid out intelligently so one doesn't have to walk all over the restaurant. The buffet is priced reasonably at $42 with an optional menu selection of main course for an addition $10+. The selection is wide enough, without becoming confusing. Staff are watchful and attentive. The restaurant is not overly busy, so it is possible to have a good conversation over lunch. Quality of food is consistently excellent. This is a favourite place of mine for a quiet business or private lunch.

On a recent trip to Singapore, my partner and I booked a table at this restaurant to experience their semi buffet dinner. We arrived on time, greeted by someone at the front desk, shown to our table, where we were greeted by our waitress for the evening. Asked to select if we wanted A la carte or Semi buffet, after much pondering we decided to try their semi buffet menu. We both selected the wagu beef, and advised that we were in a rush, so please don't start preparing our main until we've advised, we were told not to worry as it normally takes up to 50mins before mains are served. Great! plenty of time to enjoy our buffet starter. We then selected a bottle from their wine list, but told it wasn't available, disappointing, but no worries, we'll select another one. Not fives minutes into our entree, we see one of the chiefs bringing out two steaks??? He wondered our way, where I proceeded to tell him, no that will not be ours! What a joke! We then spoke to our waitress who told us there was a mix up in the kitchen, we asked that we will not be served those exact pieces as we requested med rare and if we are to get it will be well done. We then re-confirmed that will will let her know when we would like the kitchen to start preparing the main, again we wanted to enjoy and relax, not to rush. We finished our entrees, plates were cleared but we weren't ready to have main just yet... well to bad , out comes our plates of steak, but this time in a vain attempt for them to rectify their error from before, they served our mains on overly large black plates, really????? Sorry but we hadn't advised we were ready for our main. You would think a five star hotel restaurant could accommodate this simple request. The kerfuffle that took place near our table was just so off putting. By this stage we had three people waiting on our table. The waitress, the chef and the restaurant Mgr. We were asked if we would like pepper, we said yes please, only to have to end up getting the pepper grinder ourselves. We were given a dessert to compensate but honestly, there was already a sour taste in my mouth from this whole experience. Food was average, over salted to create flavor. Not a good experience overall. The table next to where we were seated was vacated before we had been seated and you could see that there must of been a family with young toddlers. The fact that during the whole duration of our visit, that table wasn't cleared up. Sad as I hate giving bad reviews, but sorry guys. It just wasn't great. Communication between wait staff/Kitchen staff need to be worked on

One-Ninety is the main breakfast / lunch restaurant in the Four Seasons hotel. Both breakfast and lunch feature buffet options as well as a la carte choices and a great selection of both western and asian dishes. As buffets go, the selection for both sittings is pretty good especially as breakfast is included with some room rates. In keeping with the rest of the Four Seasons, Singapore, service is very good - friendly and attentive
5
I was here with a bunch of friends recently for dinner during the first Singapore Restaurant Week event of the year. We chose One-Ninety because the dinner sitting times of many other participating restaurants didn't fit in with our schedule. And One-Ninety certainely turned out to be an excellent choice for all of us. The restaurant was quiet when we arrived but the waiting staff used the opportunity to engage us in conversation, as well as to explain the restaurant's dining concept. The appetisers and dessert were offered in a buffet style which allowed us to try the many different dishes on offer - most of us were impressed with the scallops, duck, and the cheesecake. But the main courses were the attraction of the night. My dining partners found their portions of baked salmon and spring chicken a little too large, but my octopus was just nice since it meant I got to have more dessert. Throughout the evening, the waiting staff checked in on our experience. Much as the food was very good, their service will probably stay with me longer

Visited One Ninety last Sunday (19 Feb) for Sunday brunch as I had a visitor in Singapore. Made a reservation the same morning - was surprised that they had a table available but so pleased as from previous experience the brunch on Sundays was one of the best in Singapore.Went to the hotel and proceeded to the restaurant. I could not believe my eyes - this once sumptuous and spectacular Sunday brunch was no more ..... I reminded me of the opening words of Anais Nin's book Paris Revisited "The Paris you love is dead" - the buffet I remembered and loved was surely dead. It was a glorious and spectacular buffet - in my opinion the best in Singapore. Former food and beverage manager Daniel Simon was the architect of a feast so wonderful you would remember until old age - fresh seafood, ethnic foods, sushi, it even had a bouncy castle upstairs and children buffet where you could deposit your children. Ah days of yore!!!No we had a meagre offering similar to a weekday lunch. Buffet starter - main from the menu and buffet dessert. Such a disappointment. How could a restaurant fall from such a stupendous event to such a mediocre apology. If Mr Simon is still alive the GM urgently needs to bring him back. If he has expired he must be turning in his grave to see such a desecration of a once glorious restaurant he created and nurtured - I mean somersaults - not the odd turn!!My visit was devastatingly disappointing. Not worth a visit - I can't be the only one thinking this as the restaurant was less than 25% occupied - as opposed to the old buffet which had two seatings - more than twice the number of seats on each seating which spread to the corridors, adjacent bar and patio. How very sad. In those days 100% occupied and very difficult to get a reservation. I certainly won't be visiting again on a Sunday.

There is a combo deal for 64sgd ++ for the starter buffet and a main course. Else you can have a la carte which is a mix ofFar east dishes, sub continent and italian ...or just grill with a steak! Service is impeccable and friendly. Looked at the wine list st by the glass and looks decent. Then move onto the lounge bar which have an outdoor space to try one of the many cocktails or sip a cup of tea.
5
Love the usual high standard of service here. The Truffle Foccacia is our all time favorite and always go well with a nice glass of champagne. They have a nice list of below $100 wines now with decent offerings. Can never go wrong with their wood fired grille items. Only place that we go to that offers consistent service at 7-8/10 levels.
5
I liked the buffet for starters and desserts. The fish as main course was well prepared.
Overall a nice hotel restaurant
5
Excellent service from arrival to departure. The manager and every service staff were polite and friendly - hallmark Four Seasons. Food selection and portions were generous. Loved the experience - a wonderful dinner. We will be back!

Whether you have the breakfast buffet (with U.S., Asian, and Indian choices) or dinner, the food was excellent and the service first rate.
4
I have been a regular at 190 for a while, and have always thought of it as an excellent venue for a buffet lunch. While the food remains great, there seems to have been a huge turnover in the service staff there, and this appears to have unfortunately resulted in a very visible drop in service quality - as evidenced on 3-4 recent visits. I have seen service spoons lying on the floor, next to the buffet tables and the waitstaff passing by would not bother to pick them up. They also don't seem to pay as much attention to detail when taking drinks orders
3
This is a casual and very open type eatery, a little like a high end canteen. It is pleasant though and it's a nice place to do casual meals with the family, especially if you have kids. Staff were pleasant, very polite and though they were busy on the night we were there, they still tried their best to be attentive and were generally all very professional. The food however was rather average especially the steaks. I think this was a disappointment given that the restaurant name gives the impression that this is a steakhouse. The steak and the lamb were really very average. The tuna steak however was pretty good. The sides were actually of a more spectacular standard than the mains itself. The grilled veggies were absolutely one of the best we have ever tasted.
4
This outlet is our second trip there.What we like this place,is the services and not that heavy filling food you normally get from buffet.We only there for their semi buffet dinner..there's a change to their main menu,with three group of choices.Italian selections,Asian specialties and from the Grill.At $64 ++,is reasonable with this kind of atmosphere and service.And it will be wonderful if they add in a cup of hot beverages .The restaurant manager SaifAli and staffs like Shaan and Simon has make my day brighter and enjoyable.Thumb up for their great services
5
Great place to hang out or for a business meeting. Excellent service, great food, drinks and service. And most important great choice of cigars and an outdoor area, which is well appointed and where you can actually sit, relax and enjoy you smoke with a nice cognac or whiskey. This place is a must visit when in Singapor
4
This was our first visit to One Ninety.We were greeted by friendly staff who explained the menu. You have a choice of the buffet or choosing from the menu.My husband had the steak which was cooked perfectly and I had meat platter. This was really good.We look forward to coming back
5
Went to try this old favourite after its recent makeover (unnoticeable; but I was told that the floor was redone). The food spread remains as good as ever. All the old favourites are back, including fantastic desserts (including the bread and butter pudding as well as the fig pie). Remains a great value meal
4
Had lunch couple times here and they have never failed in their service. We ordered a wanton noodle for our 15 month old grandson and he didn't seem to enjoy it so the Restaurant Manager offered us spaghetti at no extra charge. All the staff were attentive and friendly. The executive pastry chef also came to chat with us. Their set lunch was good too. If u enjoy antipasti and dessert, you must try this restaurant
5
Visited for lunch and ordered the lunchtime buffer with main course from menu selection.
This restaurant never disappoints - ordered the cod for mains and partook of the buffet for starters and dessert. Loved it. Fine dining at its finest!!
Would highly recommend!
5
I had the Salmon and free flow appertizer and dessert at the buffet bar. Food was great for hotel standard, usually would not have high expectations on hotel food.
5
When in Singapore we go here for the wagu burgers which are excellent with great four seasons service definely worth
A visit
5
The buffet was excellent, had fantastic pates, parma ham & other cold cuts, a wide variety of cheeses and desserts. Good value at $39, or $49 with an additional entree item (had the scallops). Service was impeccable.
4
The choices for breakfast and dinner were good. Food was presented nicely and everything was very tasty.
5
They have both an ala carte and a buffet option - we went with the buffet which comes with one main. We started with a salad, ham and cold cuts, and a cheese spread, all of which was very good. Then the steak came which was huge and excellent quality. Unfortunately I was completely stuffed after that, so didn't manage to try the rest of the buffet.
3
This restaurant came up in a goggle search as one of the top five buffet restaurants to visit. We dined at this restaurant on a Friday night and were very disappointed . Food was okay choice limited for a buffet style and very expensive for what you get. The hotel is probably one of the best in Singapore but l would not eat here again $11 for a cup of coffee explains it al

We went to Four Seasons for our son birthday lunch. Being used to a wide variety of buffet spread, we were disappointed with the limited spread. We did not go repeatedly to the buffet table and were waiting for our main course and looking bored. Than a waitress came over to ask my husband if he would like any food which she would get the kitchen to prepare specially. We were very surprise with the offer from her. We thanked and declined the offer. 5 minutes later, the asst restaurant mgr Mr Saif Ali Siddiqui came over and wanted to know if the food was not up to our expection. He not only made a special dish for my son, but went the extra mile and made sure my family had a good time in the restaurant. Those who are reading this... the food is very good but the personal touch by Mr Saif and his staff made our visit there a very pleasant and satisifying experience. Four Seasons should be proud of their staff and recognize their contrubution to carry the Four Seasons flag high. Best wishes to Mr Saif and team.
4
A satisfied dinner - we came on a weekday, hence the restaurant was quiet. Initially, I was given a cushion sofa seat, however I found that it was too soft and not comfortable. I requested a change of table and the request was promptly met. The beef was done well and service was impeccable. I had the fish, and it was good too. Always enjoy dining at a Four Seasons property, especially when the staff greets you by your name - adds a personal touch to the service
4
Overall, a solid restaurant in a top notch hotel. The food is good and the staff are extremely competent. You wouldn't expect anything less in a Four Seasons restaurant. My only disappointment would be the overall feel of the restaurant. It does feel a bit dated to me and rather 'open' lacking in discreetness.
5
The One-Ninety at Four Seasons was great. The breakfast offered a variety of dishes to satisfy all cultures.
4
Overall, very good spot - great buffet at weekends and also during the week with a simple but well thought selection - the weekend dessert range is over the top and fun with lots of good salad and cheese options too. Would like to see more range and an improved in selection of cured meats.Head chef Nicholas is very friendly and present.Service is great with an excellent manager and attentive waitstaff. Decent menu for kids, could be improved beyond the usual fries+something else. Would be great to also see more themed offerings and a stronger focus on provenance of ingredients

Mezze buffet last nightNo sashimi, basic maki, only one fish appetizer, the rest were interesting takes on several vegetables and salad. A nod to the mediterranean as its Ramadan now. Highlight was the prawn which was hit and miss in terms of freshness. You know that something is afoot if the highlight is the prawn dish.Dessert was ok Some selections for cake lovers.At $58 I would price the main (which is ordered) at $40 and the appetizers and dessert take at $18Add 10% and 7% GSTAverage price for a hotel coffee house setting and above average (but very small) serve of stea
5
We had the mezze buffet - selecting the tuna, sea bass and pumpkin dishes as the main courses between us on the two nights.The selection of appetisers on the buffet were outstanding -wide range, high quality ingredients, interesting combinations in the salads. Who would expect salmon caviar as part of a prawn dish on a buffet? The dishes on offer each night were different, with about 40% being new on our second evening.The pumpkin dish was amazing.... pumpkin 3 ways on the dish.... I should have stuck with this on our second evening here!The cheeses on offer were well selected and offered a range of textures and flavours. The desserts were wonderful -and served in bite sized portions so you could comfortably try a few. My favourite was the lavender meringue.If you are staying at the four seasons I recommend you try dinner here
5
We read an article about Four Season Singapore's One-Ninety and wanted to try out their wood-fired steaks and seafood - Mezze dinner buffet. They had their buffet spread of appetizers and desserts on huge wooden buffet tables which looked magnificient and a selection of one main course from the menu for S$58++ per person plus a supplemental charge depending on what you select. Appetizer buffet was a great spread with quality western and asian food; cheeses, cold cuts, sushi, sashimi and had many choices for anyone. For the main course we tried Rangers Valley Wagyu and Sea bass fillet, very simple but delicious and succulent and a generous portion. Dessert buffet was dissapointing as we expected a little bit more selection to cater locals as well as others. The service staff in both Restaurant and the Bar were very attentive, helpful and professional. Itâ€™s advisable to make a prior reservation especially for dinner during the weekend
1
We love high tea and decided to check it out! What a waste of money and time! We paid 100$ essentially for some sub-par sandwiches and desserts!Desserts were the worst -- they were not fresh, either a leftover from breakfast or from another day. The waiters were definitely conscious of that as they constantly tried to make up for smth or they were just nice. Scones were good too, it's hard to screw them up I guess! Anyway, don't think we'll be coming back
5
We have had the great experience of dining here on a number of occasions. The kitchen team under the guidance of Executive Chef Giovanni Speciale and Nicholas Owen are brilliant. The food is well prepared and presented. The service staff support this operation to perfection. It is a wonderful combination of all of the parts of the meal coming together well. A great wine list with great wines below $100. I cannot recommend this restaurant highly enough. It is now getting very busy at weekends so making a booking is becoming a requirement. Do yourself a favour and give it a try. You won't be disappointed
5
We had a great start of the new year by splurging on a family breakfast. The staff was very accomodating and my two kids (age 9 and 13) were delighted by the many choices of breakfast. We sat in the foyer as the main breakfast area was full but it turned out to be a wonderful setting. The chairs were very comfortable and it was more secluded from the bustle going on near the food stations. In fact, I would always choose to sit in the foyer from now on. The food selection was great and my eggs were cooked to perfection. Of course, the location right off of Orchard is the best.A real treat

Its been a while since I have been both in Singapore and at the FS for Sunday brunch. It was the memory of many wonderful Sunday brunches there that lured me back on a recent stop-over in Singapore. I was confident it would be as I remember it and matching the excellent brunch of its sister hotel in Bangkok.Alas, it was anything but!For a start, the buffet is reduced to starter and deserts and one has to order 'mains'. The waiter was particularly keen for us to order which rushed the matter somewhat compared to the more relaxed affair of yore. Yet getting the young man to charge glasses with equal keenness was more challenging I have to say.Sad really because this was, as I recall, a belter of a venue to come for your Sunday brunch with friends and, based on my experience, I could neither recommend it based on past experiences, this visit or compared to other brunches that can be enjoyed at hotels at the top end of the scale

Had our Office Xmas luncheon a few days ago. Loved the sumptuous spread of appetizers and desserts - high quality selections, along with a choice of main course from an extensive menu at an affordable price tag. Loved the Waygu Steak (medium rare) and the Hokkaido Scallops. The only setback was the weak air condition
5
cooked to perfection with a variety of in house cooked sauces and baked potatoes or french fries the salads and garlic bread is a must to order.

The latest instalment features a main course and buffet spread of appetizers and desserts at an unbelievable price of only $58++!! Buffet sounds highly inviting but the showpiece is the main course that comprises a selection of wood-fired steaks and seafood, grilled over apple wood at more than 200 degrees Celsius in temperature. Some of the mains require additional charges but they are very worth the extra bucks. Take for example the Rack of Lamb from Australia that truly exemplifies the skills of Chef Owen who is a master at handling tricky cuts. The marinade is nothing fancy, but the meat is superbly succulent and tender, as if I was slicing a raw eggplant.The pastry team seems to know the cacao bean very well as the chocolate treats were clearly the jewels of the dessert table. They were so decadent that one would be forgiving towards the slightly chewy over-chewy macarons. Sparkling like a bar of gold, the well-tempered Chocolate Yuzu Tart doesn't hit one in the face with a sharp citrus taste but it crawls in gradually towards the centre of the tart.

Let me start by saying that I like the Four Seasons Singapore a lot, and that their Lobby Lounge and outside patio (also by the name of One Ninety) are great for having a drink or some casual food and are run by a great Team, starting with Sebastián, the Head Waiter. What a great guy he is.I don't think the One-Ninety "restaurant" is on the same league. It's, in a few words, the Hotel's Buffet restaurant (Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner), and you pretty much order à la carte your Steak or Seafood. Seating arrangements and décor correspond pretty much to its use as a Buffet: impersonal, cafeteria-style.My rib eye steak was very very average, both the meat quality and the firing. I would 99% say that it was not wood fired, and I'm afraid I'm not wrong on this one. Starters and side dishes were on a similar league: reasonable hotel food, but definitely not what you would expect from a steakhouse-type restaurant run by a Four Seasons hotel, at Four Seasons prices.When I arrived there, my "sixth sense" was telling me not to stay, after I realized it was the Hotel Buffet, but I was tired, it was getting late and would need a cab to go elsewhere. I trusted that Four Seasons would run a nice Steakhouse in their Singapore property, I was wrong

Four Seasons is like a trustworthy, goody old friend to me and I have attended many events and gatherings, on both business and social basis, in Four Seasons hotel, over the years. It has never disappointed me in terms of food quality & service standard, top notch & getting better to best! Dining in One-Ninety is a routine for our committee after the quarterly board meeting which is held in the hotel. It is a perfect place for us to unwind and relax over wine anddinner.The ambience is warm and cozy, not crowded and noisy. It is a more up-scale restaurant and mostly frequented by their hotel guests. It is certainly worth paying more for the food quality and the excellent service standard. The wagyu beef and grilled salmon are 2 of my favorites. Both come with a salad and portion is really generous. For weekend, their champagne Sunday brunch is superb. The only problem is I ended drinking and eating too much and that will be the only meal for the day
5
Heard many good reviews on One-Ninety and indeed it was great! Buffet with one ala-carte main course and free flow of ham, cheese, cold seafood, roasted food, desserts and drinks (coffee, tea). Tried their lobster and wagyu beef set, lobster was fantastic while wagyu beef seems just average. All main course comes in generous portion and served with truffle oil fries which was very fragrant and tasty. The roasted pork belly and truffle quesadilla are must tried too! Dessert was surprisingly good for a non dessert lover like myself. Staffs are attentive and offers very good service (one of the best in Singapore).For the price, it is definitely worth it

After we checked in, it's was already 3pm. Hungry and tired, we decide to have our late lunch here. The lunch buffet is over, so we ordered ala carte. Being vegetarian on that day, I order vegetarian pizza. My on had the tomato soup and my niece ordered club sandwich. Pizza is good. So are the soup. Sandwich is 'normal'.We don't have chance to try more but being located inside four seasons, it must be good. Maybe next time round

Went on a return visit to One-Ninety. Each visit tells me that this may be the best buffet in Singapore, albeit not as good as it once was. The spread this was as good as usual - a fine collection of western and Asian starters, including some very fine and rare cheeses from Italy and France (frankly, the accent is on western, rather than Asian, stuff). The spread is less elaborate than in the past, with the new salad counter looking a bit skimpy. The desserts were a little disappointing this time (does anyone still eat merengues?) and I certainly missed the bread pudding

Being a dessert fan with sweet tooth, the dessert buffet at One-Ninety definitely enticed me. What's more, the classy, vintage ambience in this restaurant was perfect for an afternoon of high tea indulging in delicious pastries and sweets.We were wowed by the spread of cakes, tarts, madeleines, panna cottas, pies, cookies, and items for chocolate fondue and other sweet pastries. There is also the chocolate fondue. We loaded plates after plates of goodies to eat and wash down with pots of hot tea.For more detailed information and photos, please visit: http://thearcticstar.blogspot.sg/2013/11/dessert-buffet-at-one-ninety-four.htm

The food is good and represents excellent value. Service is attentive and friendly. Atmosphere is discrete, elegant and understated, à la Four Seasons. But this must be among the most underwhelming main dining rooms among the top hotels in Singapore. More for hotel guests and a 'canteen' for people living in the area

We ate the set menu at Christmas dinner. The food was outstanding. We had a five course dinner with wine pairings. The service was great, and the food was fabulous. The steak was prepared perfectly. We would definitely return for a special occasion.
5
The menu was varied, the winelist extensive and the waitstaff were exceptional. A good choice for business or pleasure.

I used at breakfast time because of my staying Four seasons hotel Singapore, this was excellent.
Breads and cakes were very very good, coffee and juices were good, too.
Staff's service were very friendly, kind, and at home, I felt good.

The last time we had brunch here was December 2012 and it was excellent. They've changed the format so there is a less extensive buffet (but still opulent with seafood, charcuterie, salads, cheeses, desserts etc.). The buffet is included with a main course, ranging in price from S$66 - 88. There is no option for buffet only. Free flow champagne is extra of course; we chose the Veuve rose for S128 per person. All in all this is a bit bit pricier than the Ritz, which is another brunch spot we enjoy, the Ritz however has an entirely buffet format.There were two major disappointments with our meal. One is that our champagne glasses ran dry and they "had to go to the second floor to get some more." The restaurant was only about half full, so it perplexed us why they would run out of champagne when there was a free flow option on the menu. The second disappointment was that our main courses were terrible. My husband had the squid ink pasta of which he ate only a few bites because it was inedibly salty. I had the poached eggs with hollandaise, truffles and spinach which had no flavour at all: the truffles were like pieces of cardboard, the hollandaise was balnd and flavourless. The presentation of both dishes was no better than if you threw some food on a plate in your own kitchen. With our tab coming to over S$500 for 2, we'll go elsewhere for brunch in the future. There are many excellent options for brunch in Singapore and this is not one of them

We eat at this restaurant every time we stay at the four seasons as its very convenient and always satisfying. They have recently updated the restaurant with a new look, new uniforms and a new menu. The restaurant now as a fresh feel to it and they have kept up with their great food and superior service. Some of the previous menu items were kept even through the update. As usual we received top notch customer service during our meal.We had the cold seafood platter, charcuterie board, mussels, hainan chicken rice, and chicken nuggets & fries for the kids. The food was great and fresh. I only heard praises from my wife and kids about the food, which also came out very quickly (even better since we were starving).Will being trying out the new sunday brunch tomorrow

We had Sunday Brunch here and it was amazing. The restaurant has been recently updated and has a very good ambience. The buffet isn’t like some where there is endless aisles of food stacked up and left to sit around. There is still a wide choice and more importantly everything is well presented and always replenished. The format of choosing your main from the a la carte is also something I really liked, which meant the buffet felt more sophisticated and an overall fairly relaxing experience. The Wagyu steak was incredible, perfectly cooked the head chef even came to check that everything was to our satisfaction. The dessert selection was brilliant something for everyone, the mint macaroons were the best I’ve ever eaten. Well worth a visit if in Singapore

The refurbished Four Seasons restaurant One-Ninety has made several improvements. On the recent day I visited, it had few patrons so it felt cosy. But if word gets out, I suppose it will start to get more crowded. The lunch buffet was quite sumptuous, with a good selection of eastern and western delicacies. The western selection was somewhat better with many rare cheeses and cold cuts, complemented by many salads including cous-cous. This is not a place for vegetarians or those who like hot meals

One-Ninety reopened on 29 July, with a new concept and new menu. We tried it for dinner on the first night, and it was just fantastic! I am lucky to stay often at the Four Seasons, and the service here is uniformly terrific. The breakfast buffet is uncommonly interesting and tasty, but I did not frequent the restaurant for dinner. I am glad we gave it a try, because the new menu of wood fire-grilled seafood (and steak, if you prefer) was delicious and the service was classy but not stuffy, attentive but not too much so. I had the tuna steak (med rare) and broccolini w/chili oil and garlic chips. The tuna was outstandingly done, and beautifully served with an unusually bright aioli on the side. The broccolini was crisp and just the right amount of spicy. My husband had the haddock and portobello mushrooms. The haddock was the best he's ever had, and tasted much better than a simple haddock had right to. The mushrooms were unbelievable and tasted like a great steak. Both fish dishes came with a small green salad on the plate, so the extra vegetable sides might not be necessary for some but were terrific additions.The wine selection was quite good, and we had a delicious Sav Blanc. More importantly, the server gave very helpful advice on this choice, and the waitresses did a great job checking in with us and chatting in a relaxed way, but also giving us space to enjoy our meal together. It is actually the best restaurant service we have had in any restaurant (hotel or otherwise) in Singapore. This is a completely unsolicited review, but I think the chef and staff should be very proud of this opening. The meal was also a good value, pricewise. We will definitely go back for dinner

I was attracted to the dark cosy ambience of the restaurant when I first passed it. Finding it more of a romantic setting attracted me to dine in it. I ordered the buffet for entree which consist of sushi, shaved hams, salads, chinese char siew and roast pork and an array of cheese selection. The sushi is good with assortment of sushi like egg, tempura prawn, jelly fish sushi. You also have a slecetion of desserts such as macaroons, cakes, tarts and fruits. There is a salad bar for D.I.Y salad. The buffet entree can be eaten without having to dine the main course which cost additional $10 on top of the $38 priced buffet entree.I like the table setting and furniture for the dinner table and seat. This buffet is suitable for diners who do not wish to stuffed themselves with loads of food.Suitable for light dinin

Had a top-class meal.. Excellent starter (crab legs) and then trout (superb). But the service was really great. The head waiter was very good and the waiter (Shaun) also very good. Shaun really "gets it". He understands what customers want and provides solutions; very good, especially for Singapore.Very good meal
5
Great food. Service was exemplary. We ate at breakfast and once for dinner. At all times the service was brilliant.
4
The food variety was enormous. The service was very swift and efficient. Very attentive to our needs. We only had breakfast for 3 days but the menu changes daily. Its brilliant.
4
Everything was good and fresh. Liked the fresh fruits and hot breads. Although the live stations were limited and had to wait long for eggs order. Exceptional service
5
The beef was almost raw and it was like butter. The rest of the food was great but it's a haze in comparison to the fillet on the carving paddle.
5
Tired after arriving from remote Indonesia, 190 was a welcome, convenient dinner option in the hotel. High standard of Italian fare. Though the pizza appetizer was not exceptional, the burrata cheese was best ever. Perfect steak and yummy desserts.

We booked a table for dinner with 2 of our Singaporean friends. We are staying at the hotel so the location was very convenient and from breakfast we have come to know some of the chefs here.Executive Chef Giovanni Speciale took personal control of the first 2 courses. To begin he made a circular foccacia with baked cheese and truffle oil into the mixture. It was absolutely delicious and we all thought it would make a great lunch with salad. For the formal starter we had a light salad of mango and crab. The flavours of the fruit and the seafood complimented each other really well and we had specially requested nothing too heavy as we didn't want to spoil the enjoyment of our main courses.For the main course 2 of us opted for a Wagyu beef steak. We requested that Chef Giovanni cooked it in the way he would recommend since he knows the meat extremely well. Most Chefs would not like to see this excellent meat incinerated and dry. It was delicious with good marbling and it was extremely tender to cut and eat. The other 2 diners has a seafood meal which comprised some tuna steak, sea bream and lobster. I gather it was wonderful and extremely well cooked and presented. The side orders were sauteed mushrooms, mashed potato and a mixture of green vegetables. We all enjoyed it very much.Desert took us into the very talented domain of Pastry Chef Audrey Yee. 3 of us opted for her excellent mango cheesecake accompanied by coconut ice cream. The plates were clean at the end so I guess that speaks for itself. A signature dish at Four Seasons Singapore has always been the Royal Hazelnut Cake. Chef Audrey has remained faithful to this but with her own fabulous creative talents she has made it into an ice cream based desert covered in warm chocolate sauce. The oohs and aahs coming from the person who was eating this was evidence enough that it worked. The glass was empty and I am sure would probably have been licked out if that had been possible.To accompany the meal we opted for some Argentinian Malbec. The hotel offer the Terrazas Malbec and it is extremely drinkable and accompanies most food choices. We also discovered the same wine on the list at Lawry's The Prime Rib in Singapore.The evening and the meal, with impeccable service, was so successful we plan to repeat the experience soon

We went here for Christmas Day brunch 2012 and were left very disappointed. It had been recommended by friends as one of the best brunches in Singapore, but it most certainly did not live up to expectations. I understand that on Xmas day the rates are increased, which I accept, however I do not expect the quality and overall experience to reduce. Rather than a normal brunch setup the hotel decided to take out the main course and make it al a carte. It seems the reason for this was to get more tables into the restaurant, however this left us very under-whelmed. The quality of the second sitting was below par and in some cases it seemed that the hotel had ran out of items. I would not recommend this brunch to anyone and there are definitely much better brunch venues in Singapore. The hotel needs to decide if they prefer profit over satisfaction and return customers. Very disappointed.

Yesterday was my first time at One Ninety. I was celebrating two friends' birthday celebration with 5 other girl friends. Service at this hotel was top notch, from taking our reservation to dining. We had the buffet appetizers and dessert and ordered main course from the a la carte menu. Though buffet spread is not extensive, quality is above par. I had beef tenderloin which was good but not outstanding but stole a portion from my friend's ocean trout which was delicately cooked and awesome. But what got us raving was the outstanding service we received - our server, Apple was polite and initiative and a very pretty Japanese looking server was gracious and attentive. We will certainly come back again

Have had dinner here about 5 times. Overall very good, but a little short of excellent. Have had one bad meal here once, when I specifically (and extraordinarily clearly) requested lamb chops to be cooked medium rare and they came out extremely well done. I also feel they "rush" the food, and find the staff irritating in their obsession to clear used plates etc, notably at breakfasts. Saying that, I passed these comments back to the 4 Seasons management and I feel they reacted well, ie I feel they went out of their way to ensure this didn't happen again etc - which is actually what makes 4 Seasons a great hotel - everyone makes mistakes but they seem to really listen.The crab leg starter is superb. The lamb chops (when they did their second attempt) were perfect. This week I had the oysters and the sole, both of which were very good. I find the desserts choices disappointing, very limited, and all seem to be cold, largely ice cream based. Why not a simple apple or rhubarb crumble, for example? Good in some ways to have an excuse to reject desserts I guess... But seems like a wasted opportunity for something which is quite easy to pre-prepare and stick in the fridge.Breakfasts are very good indeed, excellent choice and nice touches like fresh blueberries and raspberries, Manuka Honey, cooked cherry tomatoes, etc.Worth noting that you can eat from the 1-90 menu at the bar or outside in their verandah if you don't want to eat in their restaurant.Environment is very nice in main restaurant, tables not too close etc.Recommended

We often go to the Regent but have been searching for something quieter, less frantic and classy without being overpriced, we had a great experience. The service was excellent. The quality of food was outstanding for a buffet arrangement. Seating was very comfortable and there is a good distance between tables. We will be taking all our visitors there
4
I liked the quality and selection, from japanese to chinese, international etc. They just need to have some changes after 3 days cause they were all the same for 6days.
4
Food was quite good. Service was excellent. Lots of attention to details. Would recommend to anyone interested in a nice meal without the muss and fuss.
5
I had the cod and my husband had the australian steak which they both said was excellent. Really good service and maybe the best italian coffee outside Italy!
4
They have a gorgeous breakfast. My wife had a truffle risoto, it was very good. I had a grilled lobster. Perfect.

My husband and I had buffer breakfast and dinner at this restaurant and we were quite satisfied with their food items and their wonderful service. For the buffet breakfast, both Continental and American are served with the later one at a price of SD8.00 more which we found it quite worth it. Many varieties of danish and sweet fruits. Hot items include chinese dim-sums, noodles, Japanese soup, steamed rice, noodle soups, vegetables....We had a three course dinner meal offered as benefit of Amex Fine Hotels and Resorts programme. Dishes are in reasonable portion and not bad in taste at all. The restaurant ambience is very friendly and comfortable and relaxing

I enjoyed a business lunch at the One-ninety on a recent Friday lunchtime. The restaurant had very few guests and was very quiet, which was ideal for our business lunch. The seating and ambiance of the restaurant was very relaxing, yet classy.We chose from the Al-a-carte Menu, although there is also a buffet selection. There was a choice of about six entrees and about a dozen mains. All our meals were served together and were delightfully presented. After our entree the waiter actually asked if we were ready for our mains to be prepared, which was a nice touch.We did not have a desert and instead enjoyed a coffee, which was a very nice blend.Whilst the food was good and perhaps a little pricey, the service was excellent. A great location if you want some quiet, a tatsy meal and great service

Had their buffet breakfast on a weekday and had a fantastic selection of food. Fresh honey straight from the honeycomb, a huge selection of breads and cold cuts, Japanese, Chinese and noodle stations. Service was good, and liked how even at peak time (8-8.30), it was still rather relaxed and quiet. There's nothing worse than a noisy mad rush at a breakfast buffet. Will be back to try their champagne weekend brunch
3
First of all I must precise that I am french and, as such, I may seem little bit fussy....... but I am not, am I?The Champagne, as advertised, is Veuve Cliquot. It flows at will !It is a good and nice brunch, but they definetly lack this something special that would make the difference.The food is good but there is nothing there that you cannot find somewhere else.I would, however, give a really good mark to the desserts. There was the Pastry Chef, Audrey was her name (I think). She not only was welcoming, cheerful about her desserts. But she had made wonderful and delihtful stuffs as well.Otherwise nothing to remember.Eric

Went to the Sunday brunch at Four Seasons. We had wanted to go to the Fullerton, but it was fully booked and also the Hyatt was booked so we came here. I had never done Sunday brunch in Singapore and went with high expectations after reading online and hearing about how all the hotels have huge, elaborate brunches and how it's a big thing in Singapore. For $110/head without alcohol, I was not really wowed. I was expecting an elegant, romantic ambiance and it wasn't there. White the restaurant was nice, it just seemed a little too casual for me. There were no table cloths on the tables. It could have been a restaurant at any Marriott or Hilton hotel. Also the lobby in the hotel itself is not very grand or impressive unlike other Four Seasons I have been to. The noise level in the restaurant was quite high and there were screaming kids running amok while the parents/nannies did nothing to discipline them. Also there were several adults dressed in flip flops, raggy tshirts, and cargo shorts who looked like they came off a beach. When we spend this much on a meal, I expect there to be some kind of dress code and for kids to be well behaved. Not the romantic atmosphere I had expected. If you don't get the brunch that includes champagne and alcohol, soda is not even included. I think it's tacky to charge extra for soda, I'm sure charging $110 pp they make plenty of money without having to nickel and dime guests for drinks.Service was spotty. On 3 occasions, our plates were cleared and they did not give us any new forks afterwards. So I would return with a new plate of food and be unable to eat and have to flag down the staff and ask for forks. Not acceptable, especially for 3 times. They also seemed in a hurry to rush us out of there. The salt and pepper shakers were inexplicably removed with over an hour to go remaning, and had to ask for them again. Then not a minute after I came back with a dessert plate, they were removed again. Then at 2:45pm I was informed that 3pm was closing time. If they wanted to offer last pour for drinks or something that would be fine, but to flat out tell me that 3 was closing time I thought was very rude. If I want to linger a while after the food has been cleared I should be able to. I also want to note that this staff member appeared to only tell me and not other tables. They also had stools for ladies to set their purses on whom were not sitting in a booth, but nobody offered me this or asked if I needed one. Not the service that Four Seasons is supposed to be known for.The food was good, but there were no oysters as a previous review mentioned. The crab didnt taste very good. Also would have liked to see deviled eggs which is pretty common for brunch. My significant other who has been to the Fullerton brunch said they have a better and larger variety and also a better ambiance. Next time we will book in advance, not the day before, and make reservations for the brunch at Fullerton. There's probably a reason they had openings the night before and there were still plenty of empty seats there. This was a good buffet but I don't think it's worth the money for $280 per couple after tax and service fee nor the best you can find in Singapore

I go to The Line (Shangri-La Hotel) for dinner buffets because it is cheaper. If price is not a concern, head to One-Ninety's Sunday Brunch. Simply the best Sunday Brunch in Singapore. Go for the grilled lamb, risotto, oysters of various areas, organic salad, foie gras, crepes, mojito etc. It has at least a few items which left my family members and I go 'mmmm...' followed by that feeling of bliss. Haven't met any other hotel buffets that gave me that feeling. It is addictive as my maternal family members seperately made monthly trips since they tried it, just like me (couldn't afford too many times so eventually had to reduce the brunch). Really expensive, but worth it
