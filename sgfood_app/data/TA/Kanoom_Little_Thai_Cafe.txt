Dessert here is really nice, same like what I had in Bangkok street.
The portion is a little big too big for me but I think it's good for sharing and the price is cheap is good for the students or budget visitor :-)

Kanoom Thai Desssert Cafe is just located in the heartlands of Tanjong Pagar and i spotted it when i was around the area. They serve nice and authentic thai desserts while keeping the friendliness and coziness. A cafe that any Thais living in Singapore should visit

Wonderful ambience with friendly and hospitable staff. The desserts are a must-try with very authentic flavors and are presented in a generous serving. Situated within the hustle and bustle of Singapore's business district, the cosy thai bistro is a must-visit with wallet-friendly menu items that will not disappoint!

It's hard to find food of great value, or a welcoming crew at food joints these days. I'm so glad my husband and I decided to pop in Kanoom after our dinner at TJPG market, as the cafÃ© satisfied the two aforementioned points.I take pride in having my Red Ruby dessert. Kanoom's has it packed with water chestnut and the coconut flavour was on pointe. Every mouthful was utterly enjoyable. Look at the photo!We also ordered the classic Thai milk tea with pearls. Both the tea and the pearls were very tasty- not too sweet, not too "fake". My favourite Thai milk tea by far!Thank you Kanoom. You definitely deserve more than a shout out
