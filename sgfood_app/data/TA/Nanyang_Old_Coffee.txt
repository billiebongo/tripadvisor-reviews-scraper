Our place was around the corner so we had our breakfast almost everyday here. I loved their coffee! I would recommend the Kopi for coffee lovers ðŸ˜Š
5
A nice selection of simple yet tasty food for when you're after a quick feed.
The chicken and rice dishes are very tasty.
5
Hands down the best coffees in Singapore. Had multiple coffees (kopi) a day here and can highly recommend at $1.80 a cup (including condensed milk, recommended)
5
The Kaya Toast here was mind blowing. The coffee really nice. Small place for a quick breakfast close to the Buddha tooth relic. Didnâ€™t accept credit cards though.
4
The Bah Kut Teh flavor just nice for people who doesn't like strong herbs smell. Love the pork ribs, it's soft and the coffee and tea has its old feel to it.
3
Nice place to sit and relax with a coffee and something to nosh, but somehow the coffee here was not to our liking. Watery kind of Turkish coffee.A pity, because the place has character. Why do people rave about the coffee here?Maybe we got it wrong....
4
stopped by to have a quick breakfast, ordered kaya toast, dimsims and the famous teh! all at an affordable price, kaya toast serving is bigger than the toastbox chain. dont forget to check out the coffee museum next door and take home a pack of tradition teh or kopi :
5
Was on my way over to Maxwell food center and walked pass this old school coffee shop that had outdoor seating which is how Ive always image southeast Asia. The coffee was amazing, Strong creamy and sweet. (Kopi-C). Since I wanted to try whole Singaporean breakfast experience I also ordered the Kuya toast which was awesome. That butter with that sweet fragrant coconut jam spreaded on that crustless toast dripped into that half boiled egg. Just thinking about it makes me salivate. Also tried the minced pork mushroom sauce steam rice rolls which pretty good but I believe that you can find better in a hawker center elsewhere. Definitely will be back just to enjoy a cup of Kopi-C next time in Singapore
4
Great for a coffee break. Place your order inside and take a seat (in/outdoor seating). You can get a Kaya Toast set w/ your kopi. There are some cute signs outside that explain the different ways to take your coffee the SG way. Located just on the edge of Chinatown (S. Bridge & Smith St)
5
We were roaming around chinatown to look for a breakfast joint.Nanyang Old Coffee was just a few blocks away from our hotel.There was a queue of Caucasian tourists so we followed suit by lining up.We had the toast, the soft boiled egg and the coffee set.Although I am not keen with the runny egg, it was worth giving it a go
4
This place is a good start for a whole day of walking and exploring in Singapore. The price is fairly reasonable. Good food, service is also okay.
3
Stopped here for some tea and Kayla toast after lunch nearby today. Friendly service and standard products. Been here a few times now and generally quite satisfied. Never seem to have an issue getting a seat at lunchtime.
5
Great for a quick and easy breakfast. But i usually come here for the coffee. Love the Kopi C. Yummo
4
The place is crowded with tourist. The coffee is really good. The kaya toast and other breakfast menu is moderately good. The only poor and need to improve matter is the service mind of the staff.
4
Great place to have a cup of coffee and kaya toast. It has a museum too. Friendly and helpful staff. Posters that helps to translate local coffee lingo to the correct type of coffee. Kopi O, Kopi C etc. Want to know the meaning? Pay the cafe a visit. You wont regret it
5
I cannot believe that tourista pass this place by and get poorer quality at twice the price on the shopping malls. Kaya toast and black coffee for $3.50. Inside and outside seating. Visit on a week day before 11 am for a quiet morning. On the weekend for a riot of families and kopi consumption. Recommended by locals for good reason. Recommended by me too
4
A nice change from the typical western coffee shop, come here and have an experience of the coffee you have when refrigeration doesn't exist. All coffee made with evaporated and/or condensed milk, it's somewhat strong, sweet and satisfying. The shop itself is worth a visit, with interesting decor, and a constant flow of locals eating here indicates this would be a good place for a quick meal
4
Unless your taste buds have been abused and cajoled into thinking that certain US chain's "coffee" is even acceptable for consumption, this is one place in Singapore where your taste buds can be indulged and pampered with a range of coffees and teas. And it's a popular place with locals for a quick breakfast snack (Maxwell's just across the road is better if you're looking for a more substantial breakfast)
5
We found a table in the back of the cafe, which was quiet and intimate. We kept talking over an hour and it was very comfortable. We ordered regular coffee, coffee with condensed milk, milk tea, milo, and Chinese tea. Coffee tasted very interesting and we liked it a lot. Chinese tea was served with a big pot. All the drinks were less than 2 dollars. I will definitely visit this place again
3
Quaint little place with a serene atmosphere near chinatown. Went in for a cup of coffee and milk tea, was expecting a rich taste but... too watery for my taste. Despite that, the menu is good enough to cater for those looking for a quiet time with a simple meal. Could see locals and tourists in the shop enjoying their time, each with a cup of coffee or tea
3
We stumbled onto this coffee house while visiting chinatown. We had to escape the afternoon heat and humidity !! What a teat...even though we got only cold drinks, but what a find: very old-world, almost museum-like. We also bought their award-winning coffee packs.
4
We stopped here for brekky everyday whilst in Singas!
My miss 4's favourite traditional breakfast- 2 soft boiled eggs in a bowl with toast and jam on the side.
Quick, no fuss and cheap!
Will definitely be back!
3
Came back here this week for a local tea with a friend after lunch nearby. Not too many people around so fast service. Tea was pretty much the same as at other local places. No complaints.
5
Just get the set meal of Kopi-C (coffee with condensed milk), kaya butter toast and soft boiled eggs for authentic Singaporean breakfast. Donâ€™t forget the pork bun.
There is a mini-museum on Singaporean old-school coffee culture. Complete with Singaporean coffee shop catch phrases guide.
4
Right in the heart of Chinatown, serve traditional Singapore coffee and toast and much more.Also has a little coffee museum you can enjoy and purchase pack of coffee and some other products.Go for something different and enjoy.Free Wi-Fi
4
I had some 'Kopi' and it was after my stroll through Chinatown. Great place for some authentic Singaporean coffee, with a bit of history to it. They even have a small museum for you to check out.
5
If you're in Chinatown I would recommend stopping in for a cuppa. I grabbed one each morning as it's one of the few cafes open at 7am which is a huge bonus
4
This is one of thing you should try whilst in Singapore. The restaurant is on Chinese area. It's in a fact coffe museum and you can see the old fashion way of making coffee. Whilst there try Toasted bread with kaya and butter Cup of hot coffee Half boiled eggs.Sittings arl e inside and outside. Service was very good
3
Our Singaporean friend took us there to try the traditional Singaporean coffee and snack. It was rather interesting the way they had their western style breakfast mixed with Chinese elements. There was a little museum right next to the coffee shop about the history of coffee drinking in Singapore. The table mat printed with some Singlish was quite amusing to
5
not every Singaporian knows what kopi-o kopi-c stand for and whats in it. GO TO NANYANG OLD COFFEE. the menu would tell you everything you need to know about singapore coffee history and culture.the coffee is great. i love a good kopi-c in the morning with kaya toas
3
Nothing really wrong with this place.
Coffee and food good and very Chinese with a western style self service.
Only complaint is that the stools to sit on are tiny and not best suited to the more ample bottom that I have.
3
Stopped at the original outlet in Chinatown after lunch earlier in the week for some tea and kaya toast. Not too busy on a weekday lunchtime and as a result service was quite efficient. Tea and toast were pretty much the same as anywhere else.
4
Beautiful little place with a nice atmosphere, pleasant staff and a general good vibe - Had coffee, kaya toast and egg which were all absolutely worth the price ($4.80? for a decent breakfast with fancy coffee).
Great way to start the day!
4
The best local coffee around this part of town. Service could have been better though - the cashier was curt and rude. Pity, could have aced 5 stars.
4
We recommend a Nanyang Old Coffee & Museum in Chinatown food street, Singapore.
My husband like some traditional coffee.
4
Good place, we stopped for breakfast and found it worth the visit. It gives the feeling of a true Singaporean experience with good coffee and decent breakfast for a fair / cheap price.
5
My second time to visit Nanyang old coffee.
Kaya butter toast, Soon Kueh, coffee are highly recommended.
The mini-exhibition inside the shop also worths a visit.
4
Having arrived in Singapore the night before I was hungry in the morning and looking for a good breakfast with decent coffee near my hotel in Chinatown. This place was just what I needed. I had the coffee, sweet kaya toast and half boiled eggs set meal, plus a steamed pork bun because I was hungry and it was all great. Coffee was sweet and strong, the toast was perfect with the eggs and the steamed pork bun was tasty if a little dry. Service was quick (self service) and there were lots of tables inside and out.
4
My lunch companion had the Assam fish while I ordered the pork knuckle. The pork knuckle which was braised comes with an egg. It was a delicious dish and goes well with steamed rice. The Assam fish was very spicy but deliciously cooked with tomatoes and okra
4
I decided to have breakfast here on my last morning in Singapore because it's very close to my hotel on Mosque street and I wanted to try a Singapore "delicacy". I had the kaya butter toast, half-boiled eggs and coffee. It was SG$4.30 and worth the price to say I had it, although I wouldn't exactly call it a gourmet delight. Service was fast, the food and coffee were good and the location is great. I sat outside facing South Bridge Road and had a lovely time just soaking up the atmosphere. Yeah, I would go back
4
I went to the branch at Orchard Central basement. I ordered chococino and a pair of soft-boiled eggs. Chococino reeks of aromatic kopi gao and the soft boiled eggs are boiled to perfectness! I'll be back to try the menu's mains!
5
I went to the one in Orchard Central in the basement - the best bak kut teh i had for the longest time. Not crowded and love this place.
5
I love early morning go to this place and drink probably the best Singaporean coffee. It's in the heart off Chinatown, they don't have much food variety, but only for coffee worth. If you don't have acomodation yet, just around the corner many hostels.
3
"Nanyang" coffee these days is a viscous, milky affair which more often than not leaves an awful aftertaste. Nevermind this isn't Ya Kun or Killiney Kopitiam (I wouldn't even go back to those), keep looking.
3
I like this place, especially earlier morning for coffee or breakfast
Recently was back there, new team server .
It take nearly 15/minutes to get my toast , new team...service was not good
5
I have been here several times over the past year and a half. It's a great spot to refresh and grab an inexpensive local coffee or snack. Definately my go to place around Chinatown to cool down. Good wifi connection and a variety of indoor and outdoor seating. Simple, no hassles and great location.
3
We went to the Nanyang Old Coffee on the corner of the entrance into the Chinatown street food market every morning during our stay in Singapore.It was reasonably priced and filling - I recommend the Pork Bao & Ice Blended Kopi. Also tried the kaya toast and it was just okay. Overall, we were just looking for a cheaper start to the morning - before emptying our wallets in the malls / bars, and this place did the trick. Outdoor covered seating is available
3
Had breakfast here as this is where the hotel breakfast vouchers are to be used.Basic breakfast, I had the kaya toast and 2 half boiled eggs. Coffee was good and change from having Vietnamese coffee for past couple of weeks! Place always seemed to have a decent flow of customers. Worth a visit if your in the area! Staff could be friendlier tho
3
So this was our first stop for breakfast. Ordered the set meal of their kaya toast with soft boiled egg along with cold milo instead. My thoughts on the kaya would be average cause the bread wasn't hot which was a little disappointing however very delicious. Some kaya toast are so buttery, theirs are just right. The Iced Milo was delicious though.
4
Only came for the coffee, and was not disappointed.Choose the kopi with evaporated and condensed milk, sweet, balanced and tasty.A nice change from the rougher version found through Vietnam.Disappointed i was unable to purchase equipment to make myself at home, just instant coffee sachets.You will not be disappointed with your coffee experience here
4
Today was my second day having breakfast at this place. Nice staff, good coffee and reasonable price.
Hoy es la segunda vez que desayuno aquÃ­, el personal es agradable, hay buen cafÃ© y el precio es razonable.
5
I had breakfast here every day during my week-long stay in Singapore and had the best kaya toast and milk tea ever! My mom loves their brewed coffee while my dad loves their hot chocolate. Highly recommended!
5
A nice cold milktea in the centre of Chinatown area! Really good taste, they also do nice coffee with tea.. Very impressive!
3
Facing too many competition from Starbucks or handcrafted coffee, seems this local coffee stands very strong in Singapore market. No doubt, the quality is perfect and very genuine, we'll presented and exceptionally sincere in maintening the heritage of local coffee.
4
Their coffee (kopi) is to die for. They also have a wonderful butter toast with jam and half boiled egg. The prices are extremely reasonable. We've been here every morning and you can get the breakfast special which includes the toast coffee and half boiled egg for about $4 fast very pleasant nice outdoor seating. They have other snack items which are also very good. I will continue to keep coming back
4
This is goodness in a cup. Strong coffee located in China town. You can have your coffee black, with condensed milk, unsweetened milk and of course with sugar. I usually drink my coffee black but opted to have it lightly sweetened which was a wise choice. There are outdoor and indoor seating available .
4
The Kopi here was black, thick and hot (I only have black coffee with no sugar) so it was quite a revelation compared to the overpriced watered down muck served elsewhere. At $1.50 for a cup it was good value, I also came back for the Kopi combo with the toast and eggs, $4.50, a cheap and tasty any time snack. You'll find this shop at the top end of Smith street food markets and the outside seating lets you suss out the people traffic, fun and free
3
Visited the outlet at the UE Biz Hub in Changi for some local tea after lunch at a nearby restaurant. Big plus was that there was no queue and we didn't have to wait. The tea was pretty standard and perfectly adequate. Only downside were the cooking smells which ended up being retained in clothing for a few hours afterwards
4
I ordered Assam Fish (S$6) and a Teh-c Siu Dai (S$1 if ordered with a main course).I found 2 big pieces of batang fish swimming in the gravy, which I would think is value for money in Orchard Road, considering how some mixed vegetables rice stalls in heartland foodcourts charge S$4 for a fish dish.There was a layer of oil on top of the assam gravy, but the dish did not feel oily. (Previously, I had tried the curry chicken and found it to be too oily.) I did find the gravy a bit too sour and tart for my liking. There were pineapple, tomatoes, brinjal and lady's finger too. I would not recommend this dish for kids and the elderly, as the fish has a lot of bones.The milk tea, thankfully, was not tart like the foodcourt versions, and was not sweet - just the way I like it.I find wooden stools uncomfortable, especially those that were backless, so I ate and left.I visited the Orchard Central outlet on a Wednesday afternoon and it was not packed even though it was lunch time
3
I have tried the blended ice tea with some munchy side food. Not a good place to sit down to chat with friends as the place (inside is not well air-conditioned), nor the blended tea is of special fragance..... I didn't try the coffee.......Spend a bit more money to go get a drink somewhere if you really want to have a place to chat with your friends
5
Lovely coffee and very cheap. I had a Kopi and staff very friendly. Nice smoking area outside too, sheltered from rain/sunshine. Nice and close to MRT.
3
I ordered a cold Milo which was delish. It was ice blended and had a very creamy rich taste to it. On the other hand the toast I ordered was way too greasy and had too much sugar.
4
not only my Japanese theatre actor friends loves the coffee here, I managed to introduced them to the little coffee museum behind the outlet and they were amazed with the collections. great choice for great local coffee and delights with rich culture and heritage!
4
Cheap yet exceptional coffee. Stop by to have a perfect start to a day. The place is tidy and pleasing enough. Adds a lot to the Chinatown experience.
4
Recommended by Guide Books, so we had to try it - and it did not disappoint. Excellent Kopi (local coffee), great atmosphere, right in Chinatown on one of the main streets. Also sells a range of food, but we didn't try any of that. Be aware that standard Kopi includes a good wodge of condensed milk in the mug by default! A standard Kopi cost S$1.20 (ie about 60p in UK)
4
We had breakfast here the first day we stayed in Singapore. We had the combinated menu with toast, egg and coffee. The egg was very good and the coffee also. The toast had some marmalade on it, which I didn't know - and therefore was a new experience. Many Chinese people were waiting to get food, so I think also the other food must be good!I would definitely recommend this restaurant
5
The unique way that Nanyang Old Coffee makes their coffee. It brings out the full aromatic freshness, smell and taste to the customers. A set of Kopi with "kaya butter toast with half boiled eggs" is worth to taste. Thay have the best bakuteh in Chinatown
5
Walking about in Chinatown I stumbled upon Nanyang Old Coffee at the southern end of Smith[Food]St. I was initially attracted by a "museum of coffee" sign and entered for a browse. In truth this has to be one of the smallest museums anywhere - interesting but takes only a couple of minutes to view. However sampling the coffee or "kopi" was always on the agenda.Firstly the ladies serving presented their menu and took time to explain the different styles and mixes of "kopi" on offer and only accepted my order when they were sure that I understood the choices available - my original choice would have been wrong.The kopi is brewed in and poured from traditional long spouted metal kettles and my choice of coffee with condensed milk was one of the tastiest coffee drinks, rich and strong, I have enjoyed for a long time. A world away from the usual fare on offer in all the usual international coffee chains and at a fraction of the cost.But more than just kopi Nanyang offers a range of Singapore Chinese style snacks and meals. As a morning visitor my choice was "kaya butter toast with half boiled eggs". A simple dish, expertly prepared and flavorsome served with soy and pepper beside, this became my breakfast of choice for the remainder of my stay in the city.Nanyang will be my first call choice for coffee and breakfast on my next visit to Singapore and is highly recommended to anyone who enjoys a real coffee, and museum, experience
4
Whether eating alone or introducing to friends from overseas, i find Nanyang Old Coffee a great choice . a good varieties of local coffee and light bites. I like the simple but quality choices as well as the rich cultural and heritage of the embience . May be some right music and friendlier smile from the staff would enhance the overall experience 
4
The coffee here is good and if you are looking for a refreshing cold drink in Chinatown, then this is your place. The price is low and the coffee is strong and smooth. It isn't the most amazing coffee I have ever had, but it is definitely decent. Definitely your best bet for coffee in Chinatown
