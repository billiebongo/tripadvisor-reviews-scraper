Tried their Gula Melaka & Thai Milk Tea ice cream last week. Both tasted excellent!!!a short chat with the staff and found that those ice cream are freshly made with natural ingredients and real fruit everyday. Not flavoring NOT flavoring NOT flavoring :DKeep it up the good work ! thumbs up

Chanced upon this cafe when I googled 'Shibuya Toast Singapore' as I was craving for it. Went there on NYE afternoon, the cafe was relatively empty. Service was warm and we didn't have to wait for long. The toast was so buttery and light. Best combination together with the Thai milk tea icecream. However the crust of the toast was slightly hard. Still some room for improvement though. Plain water is provided near the counter.I will definitely return again

Looking for freshly made gelato with a healthier choice, this is the place should be visited! Amused by the variety of choices like Premium Choco, Musang King, Salted Gula Melaka, Strawberry Cheeseacake, Coffee...Surprisingly, every flavor taste good!A small talk with the owner, found that they are passionate and creative. No wonder they can maintain the good taste for my every visit.Other than ice cream, the shop serves Coffee, waffles and snack. A good place to chill out with friends, to have after meal dessert or sweet moments with your love ones :
