This afternoon’s lunch for two at $23.60 was excellent value for pineapple fried rice ($7.80), Spicy Thai boat noodle ($1), green curry with rice (7.80), fish cakes ($5.80). The pineapple rice came with prawns, fresh sliced cucumber and cashew nuts, beautifully fried with bits of pineapple. The four fish cakes had chopped Long beans in them, the green curry was lightly creamy with many slices of chicken and brinjal. The Thai noodle was as usual minuscule, just a few strands of tanghoon with two slices of pork and a meatball. Service was swift, smiling and friendly. Today’s meal was most satisfactory but the last time we came the food tended to be salty and over-seasoned, depend on what is ordered and which cook is on duty, I guess. We had the fish slices in sauce which tended to be too sweet and the fried kangkong was also overwhelming with the salty sambal

The $1 mini Thai boat noodle was good but weird that the portion of noodles is more for soup version. Dry and tomyam was amazing but don't mix all the chilli for the dry noodles unless you have high tolerance. Green curry ($7.8) was very cream, not spicy so quite a let down. Chicken was bland, prefer nakhorn's more. Thai milk tea ($3.50) wasn't too sweet, hence a little bland for the green version. Next time I'll probably go back and order 10 mini boat noodles instead of their mains.

After multiple visits to Thailand, we always have craving for Thailand food especially its boat noodle, so this restaurant actually offered Thai boat noodle at $1/ bowl, its the cheapest and lowest in Singapore. It only available in 3 types, dry, soup or tom yum but tom yum favor is slightly more expensive. The serving is quite fast and the 2 of us we have ordered 10 boat noodles, combination of all 3, the wanton noodle set which consist of a tom yum soup & soft drink and the winglets. The food serving is fast, the waitress I believed is authentic Thai people and she speak good English. Service is great and food tasted good, price is not expensive at all. Upon typing I missed the Thai boat noodle and the winglets, will definitely be back again soon to try on other food menu, highly recommended

Food: GoodService: GoodPrice: AverageThe promotion is S$1 noodle. Do take note. It's promotional and you need to order 10 bowls to make up for a full meal (portion is very small).OK. Having said that, it's just a Thai restaurant so expect Thai food. Price is a bit on the high side but, I'd say its close to the original taste. This mall has lots of food so take your pick.

Been here twice, tried the Ba Mee Ka Moo today and the braised pork leg was surprisingly good, very soft and juicy, but even with a thick and smooth layer of fats under the skin can't resist the temptation to gulp down the whole thing!The Moo Ping (grilled pork on skewer) was a bit bland on the other hand.Regrettably the Lap Moo (minced pork salad) seems always unavailable on both visits, wondering if this is too difficult for the chef to prepare?

The $1.50 mini Tom Yum glass noodle was tasty. Selling a $3.00 portion might makes more sense as one would likely crave for a 2nd helping after finishing the contents in two gulps. The fried chicken cake was appetising to both adults and kids. Braised pork leg with kale was delicious as a combination while the basil pork was tasty to go along with the fried egg and plain rice. The cold lemongrass drink and iced Thai milk tea were good thirst quenchers. Tom Yum soup was authentic tasting. We enjoyed our dinner very much and hope to return again
