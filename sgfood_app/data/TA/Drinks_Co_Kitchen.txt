Great place with very reasonably priced drinks and food. Food selection is also great. Definitely a place to catch-up with friends or simply just watch the action and watch the world go by about their way.

It is the one of the most chill out place in singapore !!! Great atmosphere with good food from different horizons.
I recommend this place if you want to have drink and food in a cool place.

We went there one night of a Wednesday. We ordered around 18:45 h and at 19:45h they had only brought one beer and a glass of wine for my wife. They served the pizza at 19:50h. Really bad service. They invited to another glass of wine but were not very fair when we asked why they were so slow. If you don't care about this... go. The pizza was good. I don't recommend it

I tried a lots of place to have drinks at affordable prices , to eat good food and above all to feel a good vibe/atmosphere ...If you want that , you definitely have to try this place. The Chef Adama cooks very good dishes at a fair price. Try the Chef platter, the Wagyu burger or the tuna tartare! Definitely a to go place !!
