Been there for many times, tastes average depends on the items you ordered. The food pretty standard and not much complain for this outlet.
5
So many to choose from. Hahahha if I could order and finish all of them I will order everything what they have in their menu. Except for the pork of course
Hope to come back here again soon .

If you are looking for a quick not too expensive Japanese lunch in the Novena area, this is the place to go. Food was served fast and ok for what you are paying. The place was also conducive for the two of us to have a good catch-up

Food taste wise was not bad, given each set meal cost.averaging $20-$25 max. Only had to wait 20min at 2plus pm off peak time for each mains and 1 main was forgotten to serve till we enquired. Waitresses clearing table was rather rude and loud, only manager was better service. All in all good value for money jap food though

Had lunch here today. Very long wait for food to be served (more than 30min). Meat skewers left for 5minutes before a server pick it up and serve it. The miso soup we ordered never made it to our table, no apologies! A server puting an edamame dish on our table, this one we never ordered it!The food is nothing exceptional, we won't come back

A pleasant modern decorated Japanese cuisine offers reasonable pricing Japanese dishes, ranging from raw seafood, sushi to well cooked egg porkchop or beef rice. One can choose Japanese ramen for rice. Both the rice and ramen are recommendable. Quality of food is undoubtedly good. The dining area is clean but space between table to table is a bit narrow. One needs to be cautious when bringing children to dine here. Waiters and waitresses are friendly and helpful but sometimes it takes a bit of time for the food. There's a possibility that our order maybe missed. In short, one should try

they have a large selection of Japanese food, the service is fast and friendly and food is just great, eating Ã  la carte or rapping a few sushis from the belt is just great.You might need to wait in the evening to get a seat as it sometimes crowded

Last nights night I was there with my family's of five. We ordered 3 set meals to share among us. Foods was nice and service was friendly. The restaurant always crowded. Keep it up and maintain the quality. One thing I need to mention is still prefer the previous beef set meal cause the sauce was more tasty
4
I love this place in both locations. From the outside the stylish and traditional sushi restaurant may appear very pricey but the items are varied and reasonable from the set menus to the sushi bar. I go for the 'Lady' set which includes a bit of everything from cold noodles, to tempura, to lovely green tea ice-cream. There is generally a long queue at both locations at dinner and lunch rush so the best is to get there a bit earlier or later

Had lunch with friends at Ichiban. The restaurant wasnt really crowded as we arrived around 11ish. We ordered fish udon and black pepper beef set menu. The waitress who is Vietnamese was not friendly and was quiet rude when we asked for some food recommendation. Food was ok. Service was average.
4
Extensive menu to choose from, with many set meals that are value for money. Quality of food has always been good. Tables are big enough for families.
5
Great Japanese food. Great customer service. Staff can even estimate a good indication of waiting time for food based on the existing lunch crowd.

Totally recommended for japanese food lover. Wide range of selections and the food are amazing. Service was pretty good too. Don't forget to ask for the loyalty card for some bonus too!

Although we were prepared to go to another place, when we found out that it was close, we decided to try Ishiban Moshi. Specialized in Japanese food, this restaurant offers a very decent choice at a reasonable price.Service, maybe because it was a bit late, was just somewhat poor.In resumÃ©, our dinner was enjoyable and we weren't deceived
2
It is not crowded yet when me and my friend enter at 5pm. But the service is very poor. Whenever we want to order our food, the waiter/waitress just ignore us or act can't see our waving hands. When we stopped 1 waiter passing our table to make an order, he just told us to wait and he walked away. It is not even peak hour yet and they aren't busy too. When our food came, the prawn was overburnt and all we eat was the bitterness of the burnt prawn. We didnt bother to stop the waiter/waitress knowing that we will be ignored again. They even discussed about the billing error for one of their customer table beside our table and when we called for order they all just ignored us and continue with their discussion and worst of all walked off after their discussion and don't bother to attend to us. Quite dissappointed with their service

The food at Ichiban Boshi is relatively decent for the price they are charging. It is not comparable to Tomi Sushi in terms of quality. However, for a chain Japanese eatery, their food is pretty decent (in an average way).We decided to forgo the set meals, rice and noodles, for a light brunch of sushi and small items. The fried salmon skin was a delight as always. The sushi was great as well, stick to the $6 plates if possible, it's worth it

Tonight visited Ichiban Boshi Japanese Restaurant located at Velocity (Novena Square) for dinner. Direct access from Novena MRT station.Slight queue, waited for about 15 minutes. No reservation basing on queue number only. Clean restaurant, slightly cramp when the restaurant tried to maximise tables for more patrons. Nice fresh cooked food at reasonable price. Suggest to order the wazen set which are more value for money. Side order for deep fried salmon skin was crspy. Enjoyed

A casual Japanese chain restaurant which offers variety of meals at reasonable prices. It's entrees are value for money, combined with its quality and freshness, they are an attractive option for fast Japanese food. Had the pork katsu with sashimi set tonight , at $20 it was good value for a tasty meal! Will always consider them for quick and tasty Japanese meal

3 of us had a business lunch @ United Square. There's another Ichiban Boshi at Velocity. Tempura Udon was basic. Katsu Curry a little saltish. The best was the seaseme ice-cream. Total came to about 90. Economical. Empty around 12 plus. Can't compared to similar family restaurant in Tokyo. Business lunch with colleagues; not with senior executives. Family eating-out is ok

The Good:1. Loved the food here- great taste, great presentation, especially given that we've eaten Japanese food in a number of places. A good variety of items and big menu.2. Good quantity of seating.The Not-so-good:1. The service was rather slow and the staff pretty untrained and ignorant. It took them a while to notice us and take our order even when we had arrived after peak-hours! Thereafter, when we asked them details about the dishes, they weren't able to answer. There were missing items from cutlery on our table, and they took a long while to bring it. Finally, we asked for a senior attendant who was able to help us!2. From where we were sitting, I could see into the kitchen, and it seemed like they were not practising basic food hygiene. I have forgotten the details but I consciously averted my gaze from the kitchen after that since the food was good and I was rather hungry.I hope the management can take note of these points, though at the time I forgot to feedback directly to them

The sister restaurant to the sushi joint, it has the same reliable quality. Tried the Sakura beef offering which featured premium beef. Yummy! Even better was the selection of grills; the bacon and prawn were awesome. Had a really rich and roe laden scallop.
5
Ordered black pepper salmon don, love it! Salmon is so yummy with the rice and peppery gravy, bell pepper and lettuce. You can also eat with wasabi. Simple dish, it's so good.

Variety of sushi are offered like typical sushi restaurant . Order black pig sukiyaki, quite good dinner set. Service is a bit slow. Not many servers around
4
If my channel partners come to my office, I always bring to this restaurant and I always order lunch set here. It's a bit pricey but worth it.

Had a quick dinner with a colleague of mine. Pretty busy - food was ok but not outstanding. Service staff was a little bit unmotivated and slow - should be improved especially if waitress wears a button indicating full focus on service and customers ...
5
Tried the Kushiyaki, the variety is great, My wife has an acquired palate and she too love the food. We tried some mains and the desserts. It is busy place and good service.

As a Japanese food lover myself I couldn't complain much about this outlet. This is my second visit I ichiban boshi but a different outlet from the first visit. This outlet located at novena is much better than other outlets, table settings were well organised and during peak period you might need to face a queue outside in line. We ordered a mixture of food to be shared, two different sets and a plate of fresh sashimi. The only downfall I would say is that they have too many good choices to choose from the menu. Everything is good and it wouldn't disappoint u. I did try the salmon head miso soup. It comes with a burst of flavours and very appetising. Environment were good , good were good. Worth the visits. The only reason I give it a 4 instead of 5 is because of the long queue outside during peak hours. However that couldn't be helped much as this is in a mall and they have limited seatings.

Wandering around Suntec City after visiting the ArtScience Museum at Marina Bay Sands, we happened on Ichiban Boshi where the promotional poster stopped us in our tracks.$5.90 ++ for a Hot Stone Rice Bowl set? With a choice of 5 'mains' toppings ranging from prawn tempura, grilled salmon, beef, chicken & seafood? Plus sides of miso soup, pickles & ocha?We abandoned the hunt for coffee & cake and tucked into Japanese instead. Service was fast & friendly. And the meals served looked exactly like the poster. It was not high cuisine, but was tasty & fresh

I went to this place for late lunch yesterday. The sushi plates on the belt still not looks improve from my last visited. I changed my planned to Special off-peak set which was clam, shrimps and mushrooms on rice that also came with Miso soup and pickle plus refill hot green tea. The set quality was quite good and tasty. The portion was generous. The price after gst and svc at 6.90$ made the set very valuable for money. The service was attentive. A few staffs came by top up my green tea at all time. Definitely will be back for Hot Stone bowl of Grill salmon set next time.

Ya I think some people might thought Ichiban Boshi and Ichiban Sushi are the same. I'm not sure are they own by the same boss but food experience always only good for me at Ichiban Boshi. Regardless in Malaysia or Singapore, they never disappointed me. We ordered 5dishes this time, beef set with rice, soup and orange. Mango mayo sauce prawn, chawanmushi, cheese squid ball and calamari rings. Beef served in sizzling pot, still cooking with sesame gravy, spring onion, onion and some other vege on a piece of dried leaf. Beef cooked base on your preference, you can adjust the heat by yourself or off it immediately when it's what you prefer. It taste so well with the sesame sauce and rice. Cheese Squid ball is surprisingly good. I don't usually like to eat fish ball or squid ball, unless I can taste the seafood. This is one of them, at least I don't feel I'm only eating flour. Calamari rings are still chewy after they fried it. Chawanmushi is hot when served and yummy.Lastly, mango prawn is the best order to me! Strong mango taste gravy, I have never thought it will go so well with prawn. Of course prawns have to be nicely treated and cook, not artificial powder making it crunchy most importantly, I don't know how to cook it I only know how to taste the freshness and original. The chef takes serious responsibility here, many places even hotel you can hardly taste real thing nowadays. I haven't tried out the sashimi, I hope the restaurant has integrity on their salmon too. The reason I don't eat sashimi much also because of the radiation from Japan, and the pond raise salmons. Too much chemical and toxic in there, I leave the review to those who have tried it. Have a good day and meals
