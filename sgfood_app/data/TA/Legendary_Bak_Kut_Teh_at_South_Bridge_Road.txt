Not that good, the pepper taste is very strong. Our hotel guys also said this is not the best place to enjoy Bak Kut Teh

The Name had caught my attention the first night...while I walked around the block! Thought I'll See what the food was like and why it got the name 'Legendary Bak Kut Teh! Some of the Foods on the menu are definitely unheard of...in Australia and Other Western World! However I decided to play it safe by ordering Pacific Clam Soup, Chinese Green Tea, and small bowl of rice! Quite tasty and reasonably priced. I came back the other night as well! Quite an experience that would Recommend Other Co Travellers to try! Service was Fast Courteous and Good Too

I was impressed with the clean airy ambience of this reasonably priced eatery. The service from the smartly dressed staff was friendly, helpful and efficient. My generously portioned pork fillet was very tasty - I was not adventurous enough to attempt the Pig Organ Soup. Great value

this is one of the reputable bak kut teh places in Singapore.my comments, the peppery taste was very outstanding for their soup, but it's not too spicy, yet leaving a minor kick in your mouth. Re the pork that comes with the soup, most of them were some bones lingering with little portion of meat. They offered options of ribs in the menu, I would have ordered the ribs if knowing it. Yet other bak kut teh place offers the ribs as standard.In short, I would recommend one travel all the way for this, but no harm try if you would be at nearby. A nice stop-by after visiting the National Gallery

Walk past this place at about 6pm on the way to the more popular one on the next street which is my regular Bak Kut Teh place, never heard about his place call Legendary. Did not bat a eye because there was only one table occupied. At my regular joint there was a very long line of customers waiting to enter the shop, so decided to check this Legendary place out, no regrets, everything from service, to food portions, to top up of condiments, cleanliness and hygiene was top notch. Why I say one man meat is another man poison because some people like more peppery soup, some like it more herbally, this place soup is some where in the middle which i find it just right. Service is polite, always with a smile on the face and not rushed. compare to my regular joint.Everytime I ask for a top up on my cut chilli and soup, it is done without any fuss and more than happy to ask if you need more.Cleanliness because the tables are clean and not stained with sauces when you sit down from previous customers sitting.Hygiene because they give you apot of hot water for you to sterilize our utensils.Although you pay about a dollar to two dollar more the food portions are bigger are and they use fresh pork not frozen pork. This will be my regular Bak Kut Teh place from now on

Decided to try this place recently after having a craving for Bak Kut Teh and wanted to avoid the way more crowded and busier establishment a couple of roads away. I had relatively low expectations as this place was pretty quiet but surprisingly we had an excellent meal. Unlike many other similar establishments, the service here was fantastic and everyone was very relaxed and friendly - in stark contrast to the other places that focus on mass tourist groups. Keep up the excellent service guys

Food - It was average... Dun consider this as Bakuteh... Just pepper soup (practically can't taste any herb anyway). Nice peppery flavour, but I guess I like it more peppery... The food prices are a little pricey though? like $10 for a plate of vegetable?? $9.50 for like 3-4 small chunks of meat... Perhaps that's normal?! Service - Excellent. Staff constantly checks on us, refilled our soup without us asking, refilled our teapot with water without asking... Very proactive.Overall - It is alright to visit if you are nearby and not particular. I just wouldn't travel all the way/queue for it

Usually I eat Bak Kut Teh at Song Fa or Ng Ah Sio but I tried this place for the first time.The pork knuckles was really good. Everything else was average. Prices slightly higher than Song Fa. Soup not as peppery as Song Fa. May be good for those who prefer less peppery soup.Maybe that is why this place is not that crowded. Not so Legendary.

Very nice restaurant, we stopped over by 10:00pm - still open. The lady serving us is very friendly and kind, she explained to us about different Bak Kut Teh soup on the menu, then even serviced us a free bottle of hot jasmine tea while we waiting.Bak Kut Teh istself is very nice, easy to eat soup (without too strong chili or oily flavour like other places) strongly recommend you to try this place

Went there about 10 days ago. They sell quite a varieties of other food other than Bak Kut The. Such as unique Dao Miao, quite different from usual Dao Miao, prawn/meat roll, steam fish, trotter and several others. The Bak Kut The soup is not so peppery and the ingredients can be pig stomach, different parts of pork rib, etc. The soup taste good and the meat of the pork rib can come off quite easily. Pricewise is quite reasonable. There is no queue, probably is quite new. The main branch is at Rangoon Road and the South Bridge road is their 2nd branch. A good alternative compare to the queue at Song Fatt Bak Kut The nearby
