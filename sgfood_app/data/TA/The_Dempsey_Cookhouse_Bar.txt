Huge place with lots of eating and drinking options. Not sure how it will survive it’s so huge other than owner I think has 40 restaurants around the world. Great different food. Great atmosphere and I highly recommend it. I will definitely go back.

Como Cookhouse is clearly one of the better restaurants on Dempsey Hill.Interior design is trendy with warm lighting, but which lets you see what you are eating.Service was excellent and very attentive. Best of all was the food which is truly excellent.On the negative side I wish to mention the two seating arrangement for dinner with the early one restricted to one and a half hour.And, the man who appears to be the head waiter or restaurant manager is useless, just walking around like a penguin, clearing the odd dish, but never talking to clients or enquiring whether everything is fine.The restaurant runs perfectly fine without him.We can highly recommend this restaurant and we shall return to enjoy dinner at Como Cookhouse

I've heard so much about this place from my buddy and so I was really glad to check it out on my birthday.Loved the setting and the ambience not to mention, the service was impeccable! The staff that served us was attentive and friendly from the moment she sat us at our table to the time we left .There were certain hit & misses on the menu .Thumbs up to their crunchy spiced french toast which is kindda massive and of course the Cheeseburger. The brie and black Truffle made this burger well-flavoured, even for the lesser fans of pungent cheese, as the melted Brie didn’t come across as overbearing. The patty done medium rare was juicy and well-seasoned. Don't bother to order their Fresh Tagliatelle with Clams which is lacked in flavors to the point of bland , it was so disappointing . Another dish that I wasn't that impressed is the truffle pizza , i think its kindda overrated. But overall , it's still a restaurant worth to go for despite the misses

Back at Dempsey Cookhouse after a hiatus. I like the ambience, well decorated. For overseas visItors, Dempsey is the former central manpower base of the Singapore army. The restaurant is decorated with its high ceilings with cooking pots and pans like in a cookhouse. It's Jean Georges first restaurant in Singapore. Typically we would order more starters and one main course for the three of us. We like the truffle pizza best. Whilst I am not a dessert person, their sea salt caramel ice cream with popcorn in chocolate fudge is heavenly. Pretty popular, so advisable to book 2 weeks or more in advance.
4
The place looked amazing! The servers and guys at the bar (where we were made to sit fyi) were really nice and helpful! They took pictures for us, food arrived promptly and was pretty good too. The only recommendation I have is - Book in advance as the hostess were really rude nor accommodating. Even though various tables were empty we were made to sit at the bar and they just seemed like they didn't care about the inconvenience it caused us.

Visited last year around Dec if i'm not wrong with my wife and we had quite a number of dishes. Would love to upload pictures but i guess i will do so when i find it eventually. We had the black truffle and fontina cheese. Fragrant but the pizza was burned on the crust which attributes to the bitter taste. Overall, beautiful ingredients but executed poorly.Roasted cod, was done perfectly. Seasoned well. Overall a good dish Lastly we had the miso grilled Sirloin i believe? The doneness was done to a med well when i requested for a med rare. Well, i hate to give back the dishes to the kitchen and i just had it quietly but dint manage to finish the dish which i felt sorry. Would i come back? Yes i would. I believe the dishes could have been done better and under the guidance of Jean George.. pretty sure it could be better

These guys were great, we were a group of 8. They made everything easy. We didn't have to wait for anything. The wine was always poured the food was tasty. The service was unobtrusive and good. The inside of this restaurant is something to talk about it is very nice. I can imagine sitting outside at night time is also very nice. This was my second visit and I would def go back. It would also be a place I would take guests from overseas who had done the restaurants in town. There was nothing exceptional for me to rate higher though
4
I love the environment at Cookhouse - its simple but elegant and feels very relaxed. Service was responsive but not in your face.We ordered a variety of mains at our table and they were all excellent. The snapper and lamb chops were the highlights. The snapper was well cooked with an excellent sauce. Lamb chops were also perfectly cooked. The desserts were extremely disappointing- the Apple pie was quite dense and lacked flavour - also it should be clear on the menu that it is served cold. The tartufo was also disappointing.I hope they fix the desserts soon
4
It was a rainy Saturday and I arrived at around 6:30pm! So impressed by the beautiful ambience and chose to sit outside to enjoy the greens! The vegetarian / vegan choice was limited and I had a pasta plus grilled asparagus! Complete the meal with a warm chocolate cake and vanilla ice cream! Hope to be back in my next trip to Singapore and when the weather is good!
4
We stopped for pre- dinner drinks ( dinner was elsewhere). The Prosecco was really good as was the grilled squid- excellent.My only grouse was the reception. Having never been there before we entered by a door , which I realized was for another restaurant- all open-plan.We were completely ignored, so we walked out and entered by another door ( 3 metres from where we saw the reception desk).The hostess behind the desk was anything but friendly or welcoming. Her colleague helped us and showed us to a table outside.We only had a snack , and it was delicious, but the service leaves a lot to be desired for.
5
Ambience was excellent, so were the food and service. Nothing to complain about at all, even the toilets are very clean and spacious.I love how the tables are spaced out such that we have our own privacy to enjoy a lovely meal. Servers are very attentive, prompt and made great recommendations.The Truffle Fontina Cheese pizza is a must order! I guarantee you won't regret it. The Basil Fried Calamari was excellent too, a unique batter and dip that was whipped and fluffed this high! The Prosciutto wrapped Pork Chop was delicious, thick lean Pork that was still tender and juicy accompanied by really tasty Mushrooms. The asparagus was an additional side order but perfect with the Pork!Lastly, don't forget their signature warm Chocolate Lava Cake to wrap up the night. After all this is the chef that invented it
5
This JG restaurant is an excellent and charming. It resides in the Dempsey hill area in an old colonial structure that has been redone impeccably. The food and service were both outstanding with the crispy salmon sushi and the truffle pizza being our favorites. This is a must to get away from the city and malls and eat in a charming and excellent restaurant

My family of 4 came here for coffee & dessert at 9pm. Clearly there were tables available ,both indoor and outdoor , but was told they were reserved and offer us the bar counter but will show us to a table when is available. 30mins later ,the 3 outdoor tables are still not occupied and more indoor tables available but no one came by to offer us a table . I approached the reception. Meanwhile 3 Caucasian came in (without rsvn), the receptionist asked if they prefer indoor or outdoor sitting . It was then, we were given a outdoor table. We left at 10pm and the 3 “supposing reserved outdoor tables “ were still available . I can’t help wondering why didn’t offer us a table in the first place.
5
Had dinner here recently. Make sure you call in advance to reserve as it is quite popular. It is set in old colonial houses in the Dempsey area and it’s very near to Tanglin and Botanical Gardens. The food is good. We shared a lovely truffle pizza, one of their seafood specials and had toasted egg yolk, caviar with herbs and guacamole with peas and tortillas for starters. The taste was sublime. Ended of dinner with a delicious warm chocolate cake
4
Went for a pre Christmas dinner with family. Had a big selection off the menu which we all shared. The whole baked cauliflower, the snapper in broth and the truffle pizza deserve a special mention. Tuna tartare was lacking seasoning and the three desserts we had were a disappointment. Love my desserts but the chocolate cake was dry, the panacotta had an extremely bitter lime or lemon sorbet on it (tasted like the pith had accidentally gone in) and the salted caramel ice cream tasted store bought - this was should definitely be shared there was enough for 2-3 people so very sickly by the end of it.
3
Good atmosphere, nice deco, service OK, good food but nothing exceptional. We've ordered 2 cocktails, 2 appetizers, 2 mains and 2 deserts... $500 for two, with one bottle of an average Bourgogne at $175. Far too expensive
4
Unfortunately cannot remember the exact dishes we ordered. The simply cooked option was a tad small in serving portion, however if you are ordering appetisers and others to share; that should be fine. The cod fish and beef tenderloin were done to the perfect bite. Flavours were just right and balanced. Not a lot of exciting options for desserts. Service staff were friendly and helpful. Really liked the ambience and interior deco. Great dining experience
5
We started my husband's 60th birthday celebrations here as we know first hand how good the food served at its sister restaurant Candlenut is and we've heard of the Como group's reputation; which this fairly recently opened restaurant lived up to that day: their caramelised foie gras was cooked perfectly - full of flavour while melting in your mouth - exactly like what we'd experienced in St Emilion in France.And their samosas were the best I've ever tasted - lots of tender chicken, with just the right amount of spice; all held in place by beautifully light yet crispy pastry. It didn't need the delicious dipping sauce it came with. And my husband's healthier options of tuna caesar salad and crispy sushi were just as tasty.When we were happily defeated by our two courses of starters, the bistro surprised us with a complementary birthday dessert to share; replete with birthday candle. That too was excellent - the toffee popcorn was beautifully paired with a generous scoop of ice cream and lashings of melted chocolate; all with just the right hint of sweetness. Its chef is definitely living up to the Michelin Star rating he gets outside of Singapore
5
It was an impromptu decision to have dinner here and was greatly pleased when we got an early seating reservation. The deco was lovely with warm lights, staff attentive and courteous. Dinner was exceptional! We had toasted egg yolk with caviar and herbs, warm shrimp salad with avocado, tomato and champagne vinegar dressing, their signature black truffle pizza, prosciutto wrapped pork chop, wood oven roasted tiger prawns with oregano, salted caramel sundae and their signature warm chocolate cake. We would have tried others but were just too satiated! Everything was SO good! Scumptious!We also had a few glasses of bubbly to finish off the meal. Some may think that the prices are steep but really, it justified the high standard of quality ingredients used. All in all, we will return, definitely! Thank you Chefs
5
Went there for lunch and we loved it - place was busy already at noon so we sat at the bar for lunch but didn’t mind. The staff is very professional and attentive and food was great - a bit on the higher priced range but ok
5
Nice warm lights, very high ceilings and some greenery by the bar, this place is ideal for special occasions or fancy dates; food was pretty good and service friendly.
5
Distinctive, modern and yet a throwback, comfortable: and great food! The grilled prawns were the best I've had. Also admirable: tuna tartare, grilled asparagus. And a cocktail of the month that refreshed and delighted.
1
Tried to book, understand the food is good and they are busy but reservation staff can be a bit more friendly 😥😥in turning people down, refused to put on waitlist and was non committal on waiting time
5
We visited Dempsey Hill shortly before our flight back to the UK and came across the Dempsey Cookhouse. Fabulous food and great setting! Would particularly recommend the mushroom pizza and also the Tuna tartare. Delish!
5
The setting of the place is really lovely and the service was on point without being too much. The food is very tasty, maybe too much pricey but the overall experience is a great success.
4
Conveniently located and with ample parking nearby the old black and white building has been tastefully restored. Our booking was for Sunday brunch. Whilst not completely full there was a good atmosphere and the attentive staff were being kept busy.The brunch menu is not very extensive yet the food offered was well presented and tasty. The portions are of a reasonable size.We plan to return for dinner in the near future
5
Really enjoyed this restaurant at Dempsey. It's just off the round-about at the top of Dempsey Rd, off Holland. Easy parking. Quiet.Wonderful ambience in old beautifully restored barrack black and white building. We sat outside and it was lovely.The service was excellent without being annoying, and wine list was pretty decent and not too expensive, we stuck with Napa Chardonnays.Highlight was the food. Some standouts included: burrata with fig; tuna tartare; crispy sushi; and the mains: snapper; veal milanese; lamb chops and striploin, all wonderful. Caramel sundae afterwards was delicious among 4 of us. Definitely going back soon. Thank you
2
Sunday lunch - restaurant was not too busy, beautifully decorated and well groomed staff. Main course was served before the sharing starter, so we ended up with both courses on the table at the same time. The ordered drinks arrived half way through the lunch (only to be told that they were out of Peach Bellini) - service slow, food FAST.
3
Visited here with friends for dinner. The setting is lovely and service attentive but the food was disappointing. Very surprising considering how hard it is to get a booking there. We ordered hamachi crudo and crab toasts to start followed by the cheeseburger, kale salad and dischi volanti with bacon for mains. The kale salad and pasta were the best dishes, both tasty and I would order these again but the rest was just very underwhelming. Wine glasses started at $20++ and only a small selection by the glass. Overall, overrated in my opinion and I wouldn’t rush back.
5
We visited on recommendation and were impressed. We sat at the bar and had drinks and bar snacks which were great. The whole place has a great atmosphere with couples and groups. The location has 3 restaurants but the Dempsey is the largest with outdoor dining available. I will be going again when in Singapore
5
Had a wonderful dinner here, great vibes and cosy too!! Food is good and very well price! Overall great experience! Will be back for sure!!
5
I love the Ambience to the Food and drinks. The service staffs were knowledgeable plus they were very attentive, as the ambience was warm with good taste of music made the place for the best dining in Dempsey.
4
The best baked cod I've ever eaten. Great service in a beautiful restored building utilising the old black and white colour scheme of old Singapore for stunning deco. Expensive but lovely atmosphere for a special occasion.
4
This is a delightful conversion of an army barrack. The decor is light and reminiscent of a beautiful conservatory.We shared some crispy Calamari with a citrus mayo and a Burrata served with caramelised figs and Rocket leaves. They offer a basket of delectable fresh bread with some high quality olive oil and sea salt...Perfect !My husband and I split a Cheeseburger and my son had the Tenderloin with a plate of the asparagus. We were all very pleased.Dessert was the Salted Caramel Sundae...nice.My only grouse was that the table we were seated at, was so close to the serving tables that my son had to keep ducking his head as members of the staff were continuously walking behind him, with the trays of food and drink...bit of a bummer !Having said that, everything else was really faultless
4
As regular guests to Singapore Dempsey hill is a favorite venue for dining as there is plenty of quality choices. This time we visited The Dempsey cookhouse by mistake and what a reward. Service was excellent. Menu was compact but offers variety. Some JG classics such as Fontina and truffle pizza etc. great flavours and good value. Only downside was the desserts. Read fantastic but were not as good as the other 8 dishes and beverages. Will revisit and recommend for sure
5
Fabulous food in a colonial house setting... high ceilings, mood lighting, friendly service and of course, the perfectly stocked bar and knowledgeable bar-tender. Nothing beats a night out at The Dempsey Cookhouse. Go for the impeccably done foie gras, truffle pizza and crusted snapper in light broth. End it off with the heavenly salted caramel ice cream. And don't forget to lug home some of their excellent spices from around the region and even further, to have loads of fun recreating some of their magic at home!
5
The space is undoubtedly beautiful. It is worth a visit in itself. Food is just as good as you can expect from any Jean George Vongerichten’s restaurants. Best part is that the world famous salted caramel ice cream with popcorn and chocolate sauce is served here. But why is it missing peanuts from the ABC Kitchen’s recipe
5
I've been here a few times and really love the food! This time for brunch and had the most tasty crispy salmon such followed by a wonderful salad with warm scampi. A true tasty feast! I had a dessert, and got the salted caramel ice-cream, with the chocolate sauce on the side. The latter would have made the dish too heavy as well. Beautiful light white wine and nice cappuccino. I love this place mostly for the interior design and the atmosphere. Its really top on both. Somewhat slow service on a sunday brunch, perhaps a bit more attentive staff and I would have consumed a few more glasses of wine.. pleasant place, anytime!
5
Had an absolutely beautiful meal, food was amazing!! I was also surprised at the cost as I was expecting it to be much more expensive. The decor is great too. We were a group of 6 and as we could decide on all the delicious desserts we ordered them all!! Could not fault the place!
3
Whilst the room and the service is maintained at a high standard the offer in terms of food seems to have become very basic. The food is seasoned and cooked correctly but is nothing exciting, like something you would cook at home, this is also dishes from the a la Carte options and not from the section which is new and offers simple presentation?Also do note if you do not order starters it is a very long wait
5
Family dinner for 5 adults
The place is beautiful especially the bar
Food was so good.
The egg caviar worth it! Love the prawn salad
Will come again

Went there for a fancy diner with old friend which she booked a few day earlier & we got table just beside the entrance door which is very upsetting since we booked in advance. We complain & the waiter escort us to another table at the back but still on the side, not in the main hall. We ordered an appetizer, foie gras, for the mains are prosciutto pork chop for me & atlantic cod for my friend, with warm chocolate cake. Appetizer was highlight of the meal, foie grass cooked to perfection & the unusual combination did work so well. Main, mine was okay, not gonna order it again thou, it just wasnt special enough; my friend's looked so miserable, only a piece of white fish, greens & sauce, fortunately, it tasted better than it looked. Dessert was good but I have tasted better warm chocolate cake than this one. Overall the place definitely really nice & pretty but food wasnt up to its interior's good looking, plus its quite pricey
5
I came for brunch with friends a few days back and we were greeted warmly as soon as we entered. Loved the interior and the ambience of the place, very posh! Food was great especially the Truffle Pizza (must order)! Service was excellent considering that the place was packed when we came
5
On the Friday of F1 weekend we enjoyed a fantastic evening at Cookhouse, made even more special by having Mr Jean-Georges himself in house! Mr V was even gracious enough to allow the obligatory selfie! Having got past the excitement we settled into enjoying the evening. Cookhouse is a terrific restaurant at the top of its game. A beautiful high ceiling room with plenty of space between tables the service was friendly and attentive. We shared starters including delicious calamari and salmon sushi, then bang on main dishes including steak, spice crusted snapper and roast cod. A great wine list too. 3 hours passed in an instant, always a great sign of a fantastic evening. Highly recommended
3
I was there for lunch few days ago. Nice greetings and smiles even before you walk in. Service was average but we could see the restaurant was full and great recommendations as food was good. I did experience something disturbing there was a guy who did not know when to leave in talking to the table. We were ladies wanting to catch up, it was an unpleasant interruption.
4
Nice embience n lovely bar counter . We were early at 6pm n they let us sit at the bar first to have our drink. Egg with caviar was overpriced n nothing fantastic. Pizza was not the thin crust type which I prefer. I did not finish it. We ordered a few appertizers to share n they were good. While the foods were great but I would not say it would blow u away. The staff were friendly but needed to be a little more attentive. Overall a great experience n we enjoyed ourselves because the embience was truly lovely. It is such a popular place u must book way in advance inorder to get a table. However they have 2 seating n that's a bummer !

Was looking forward to a first visit to the Cookhouse - with the Como group, there's always an emphasis on quality ingredients. On that account, the Dempsey Cookhouse and Bar did not disappoint. Food was cooked simply - we had a steak and a cod, burrata with heirloom tomatoes starter and a salad. It was simple fare with top notch ingredients. Delicious.What left much to be desired was a very strange and frankly rude policy of reminding the customer that they would only have a one and a half hour meal sitting if they booked an early slot.I'd booked online and there'd been a note informing me of this. Had a call from the restaurant the day before my booking to re-confirm and a very brusque woman made it a point remind me again that as mine was a 1845hrs slot, I'd have to vacate my seat by 2030hrs. I very nearly cancelled on that account.And then on arrival at the restaurant on the day of my booking, we were greeted by a gaggle of at least 7 what can only be described as "door b**ches" - all the women were unsmiling, unfriendly and over made-up.We'd arrived early with the intention of having a cocktail at the bar before our meal. When I informed them of this, at least 2 pipped up at the same time to remind me for a 3rd time (!!) that as mine was an early sitting, I'd have to complete my meal in an hour and a half. I told them I didn't need reminding a 3rd time. Jeez.Anyway, cocktails and meal went by without a problem except to say that our server ran around like a mad person looking after his section like a true champ, while numerous poncy posers in suits floated about doing very little except flourishes to do with wine and cocktails. It's a very odd distribution of labour. The restaurant was very overstaffed while only a handful were truly doing any work.We vacated our seats at the allotted time - we like to be conscientious that way, but stayed to have more drinks at the bar.In the extra 45 minutes we stayed past the time we'd been asked to move on from our table, no other customers took our table (!!??). So much for trying to squeeze in another party - why the rush to boot us out?And in the meantime, while we sat at the bar with a clear view of the restaurant entranceway, members of the door b**ch contingent preened and took selfies of themselves.The food is worth a return but I won't make a reservation again. Much better to turn up without a booking and ask to eat at the bar
5
took a taxi from orchard rd to this restaurant in dempsey hill, its a very breezy restaurant serving very good food. the staff at the door and the waiters are very friendly , and they go out of their way to describe the food you are ordering. the place is very clean . worth the time and money for this restauran
5
It is pretty tough to get in without a reservation so we sat at the bar. But we really liked that because it is nice to chat with the bar staff. We started the night with a gin cocktail which was elaborately served with a giant stamped ice cube and an assortment of flora. Our meals were great, perfect portion sizes. My only criticism is the wine list has prices displayed is glass/carafe prices not glass/bottle which is highly unusual and meant the bill was a little higher than we expected
3
Went for lunch. Got a table by the window but literally sitting back to back with the one at the next table. Can hear every word that is said by the tables on both sides, am sure they can hear us too. Ordered the famous caviar egg - now at $38. The famous truffle and cheese pizza, the tuna, avacado, ginger etc and the "signature" cod in green curry sauce as recommended by the waitress. Nett restaurant is pretty but no privacy. Food is OK but no wow effect. The egg - once is enough. The Cod is overcooked and slightly dry, the green curry sauce is competent. The pizza - I still prefer the one from Akira Back. The tuna - ok but had better at the Japanese restaurants. So...will I be galloping back to this restaurant soon? I don't think so. At $200 bucks for lunch for 2, I have plenty of choices
5
Love the lively ambience, the white decor, the super high ceiling, the food, the service, the everything. Especially the truffle pizza. So yummy!
3
We went with friends and its a nice place with a nice atmosphere. However food is really average and prices are way to high for this. Have tried better. Service is great though.
5
Went for a cheeky pre vacation lunch treat with my husband. We love lunches out, and we loved this one. The building and decor is cool, the service was excellent, despite being completely full for lunch, and the food was delicious. We especially enjoyed our starters, and the dessert wine ! Lovely experience, we will be back. Thank you!
2
Extrodinarily disappointing. No stools for the ladies handbags. Food was just average - tasty but nothing amazing. The worst point was trying to slip in three seating per night, and attempting to engorce that policy in spite of delays on their side. It's more McDonalds than fine dining. Despite the condescending staff.The wait between ordering our protein mains and sides was about 20 min all up, so the proteins were cold and, by the way, very small. My 'Wagyu' was more fatty Angus than real Wagyu. Worse still, as noted above, despite the extordinary delay in service we were then asked to vacate our table and move outside even though we had already ordered desert. $1000 later, my conclusion is this place is something of a tourist and prentious trap. Locals should and do know better. My advice, Singapore has so much more to offer than this pale example of fine dining. Best to avoid.By the way, they even had the cheek to mandate a 10% service charge. Since when is tipping compulsory in Singapore
5
The food is fresh, well presented and delicious. Portions are good and the price are reasonable for the venue. I've been there for both lunch and dinner service, and always leave impressed with the attentive service and detail the team put in to make the visit memorable. Will continue to make this one of my go to places to relax and enjoy a good meal
5
Was really impressed with this restaurant. Recommend drinks at the bar before sitting at your table to take in the architecture and decor of the interior. Food was sensational - we started with the egg which is a signature dish. Very expensive but nice to try at least once... Nothing negative to write about the experience
3
Knew about this place from Visting adjoining restaurant Candlenut. Ambience is excellent and services were ok. Expected the service to be on upper scale meaning that it's not looking good that's the most important but what is good service. They do exactly what Chinese restaurants do. For example They go between people when there's a conversation going on and they are totally oblivious to such situations. This is only one example. Food wise I feel is too highly recommended. Presentation and portion is below par. Portion maybe it's supposedly to be French cuisine. Taste wise is not more than average. Bar is nice and opens till late.
5
So, we went as a couple and loved it. I went again for a business lunch and loved it. We went again last night with friends from London and we were seriously, lip-smackingly impressed. Ignore the self-appointed critics who think reviews have to be negative or average to make themselves feel better as though they are superior. The skill here is in a menu where you want to order everything. Where four very different dishes, beef rib, pork chop, fish and chicken all come out looking so good you get food envy. But once you try your own, there is no way you are sharing. We'd started with their guacamole, wonderful touch of peas, and their superb crunchy calamari, all to share. After keeping our mains to ourselves, we couldn't resist sharing two desserts and again the marriage of flavour and textures was superb. The passionfruit pavlova a highlight. All this with a great wine list, genuinely world class service, delightful decor and seamless food delivery; this restaurant could succeed anywhere in the world. And long may it prosper in this charming, white Dempsey cookhouse reincarnation.
3
Service was friendly and attentive. The food was unworthy of the fame of this New York chef. The Roasted carrot salad with spices was barely edible. The Guacamole showed up with what tasted like solid avocado pieces. The Black Truffle and Fontina pizza was interesting, whilst the Brie n Black truffle cheeseburger was less than ordinary. In between the starters and the mains, they kept us waiting for nearly 30 minutes - we wondered if the kitchen was coping! The prosciutto wrapped Pork chop with glazed mushrooms n sage was edible but not memorable, the warm shrimp salad with champagne vinegar came with a creamy exotic sauce. The sage salad was super salty. The sesame crusted salmon was a disappointment whilst the Pavlova was too sweet, and not interesting in taste. Our family outing to what seemed to be a promising culinary adventure, sadly fell flat
5
I had been recommended to the Cookhouse and glad to have had the chance to go along.The venue has a bright,open and welcoming decor with good visibility into the kitchen.The food was terrific. Unique, interesting and fill of flavors. The portions weren't large but that wasn't offensive as neither was the price tag and I was very happy to leave room for a delicious desert.Service was very good, friendly and attentive.Was busy and justifiably so. Top dining destination and happy to pass on the recommendation
5
We enjoyed a group dinner in a private room at this restaurant.
The service was good and each of the courses was excellent.
The staff were very attentive.
We had an enjoyable evening.
5
Great ambience.
Airy setting.
Sharp service
Brunch menu was great as well as good value in its price
Burata- awesome with their jam
French toast- spiced and yummy
Truffle pizza- signature
Calamari- the secret is their whipped cream sauce
Will go back soon
4
What a great restaurant, great space, friendly service and excellent food. they have a great menu with an excellent wine list. Enjoy your time here and try everything there is. Great taste and presentation. Will be back. Enjoy
5
Excellent drinks and service from the bar team, professional and well polished. Prices are reasonable & sensible.
5
Truly outstanding food and good service, not always the case in Singapore! While it is expensive by Australian standards it is in line with first rank silver service Singapore. A great new makeover of one of the old barracks buildings at Dempsey. Would be keen to go back to try to the other two outlets which are part of this offering
5
We deicided to head to Dempsey for lunch on a Friday I love Dempsey for the parking and it's also close to home.Anyway we decided to try como.. we did not have any reservations but they were able to accommodate us with outdoor tables. It was a cool and cloudy Friday afternoon and was happy to sit outdoors. Not sure if I would if it was a sunny day.Service was prompt and food was great. Their complimentary Olive bread was so good. Plump olives embedded in the moist bread. We had two helpings. My daughter had a medium rare truffle burger..and she devoured it all. Quality beef and the truffle was yummy.. We also had the peach and ginger pavlova for dessert..another winner.I had the set, which was good but I might just choose from ala carte menu. There is a decent selection on the menu. I had hamichi for the appetizer and baramundi for the main. We can't wait to head back to try other items on the menu. But we do recommend the burger. You will need to make reservations for weekends. The restaurant is popular
4
Went there for a birthday dinner and was impressed by the experience. A lovely room and atmosphere with a relatively simple menu of well prepared food. Not all 100% successful (the beetroot salad tasted ok but was small and underwhelming). Still, the food was well presented, the pizzas delicious and the wine list had a few interesting entries. Not cheap but then this is Singapore
5
I went for a meal with two colleagues and it was a wonderful evening. The room is airy and light with white rattan high-backed chairs and half is restaurant and bar, but there's also a more low-key tempura bar and an Asian deli. The food, including truffle pizza and crispy salmon sushi which we all shared was delicious and the main courses also great. I had the beef short rib with sides, my colleague had pan-fried plain cod and my other colleague had salmon. The sides included truffle fries, stir fried broccoli and a selection of mushrooms. Great imaginative cocktails too. Would definitely go back next time I'm there.
3
It is staged elegantly like a Cecil Beaton's hothouse. On this particular Sunday, one can either consider it's non-complex menu as "refreshingly laid-back" or "simply underwhelming" for a restaurant with Chef Jean-Georges Vongerichtenâ€™s involvement. Designed to engage every senses, it does not disappoint aesthetically. That said, if one truly wants to nitpick, it would have to be its uneven service standards which range from pure nonchalant to many a times condescending and/or dismissive. A bit amiss as it could have been oh so genteel in every touchpoint

This restaurant is by the COMO group and opened for about 3 months. Had dinner there and it was one of the best restaurants we have been by far. The ambience was great and the ventilation good as you do not smell like the kitchen after being there for a few hours. The food is excellent. We had tuna tartare, a warm shrimp salad that was the best and must try, truffle pizza and pork chop. To end it all, we had a salted caramel ice cream sundae with popcorns and peanuts as well as a mixed berry pavlova. They were both very yummy especially the pavlova. Don't miss this restaurant when you are in Singapore

Had the good fortune of eating here 3 times in the past week courtesy of business partners. On the first visit, the food was well presented but probably over-seasoned and we fed back to the kitchen. Food was much better and well-presented at the subsequent visits. Excellent choice of starters, mains and desserts. Very popular at the moment; reservations essential

Two visits to this newish restaurant at Dempsey and here's the score from us :1. The set up is good - comfortable seating in a brightly lit dining room decorated mostly in black and white. The place has a casual and relaxed vibe. 2. Service was good on our 2 visits - better than most places in Singapore - enthusiastic and friendly. They have hired a fairly large team front of house and in the serving team. The team is young and enthusiastic.3. Where the restaurant does less well is the food. It's competently prepared but none of the dishes wowed us. Prices are pretty reasonable for Singapore considering the restaurant is backed by a Michelin starred chef and they are the current hot table. We're giving this place an average score as we think the food should be given the heaviest weighting.We would treat this as a nice neighbourhood cafe rather than a destination restaurant.

Amazing decor, great service from the moment you walk in. We had a private room, which seems to come with some very steep minimum tab. That is not really an issue given some of the prices .... that aside food was amazing and they also have a very good wine selection. Same goes for deserts. Attention to details was everywhere, with all staff anticipating your every needGetting there is a bit tricky , just like with most restaurants in Dempsey hill If the budget fits, I would strongly recommend.

Very elegant place. It belongs to vomi and you can feel it ! There is European style cuisine and a Japanese part. Design of the space is outstanding. Service is good. Fat liver is great, caviar egg, nitrata cheese, chocolate lava cake, the meat... the bread is also very good. Private room can be booked with a minimum order - to be negotiated. Toilets looks fantastic. Good wines.

My wife and I recently visited Singapore and wanted to get away from the stuffy restaurants in and around our hotel. The concierge told us about the Dempsey Cookhouse and Bar, which was in an eclectic area of the city. We didn't have a reservations, but the Guest Relations Manager was very accommodating and led us to a fantastic table with less than a ten minute wait. The interior of the restaurant is bright and has the energy of a place that's well run and where people are having a good time. Looking at the menu I was surprised at how reasonable the prices were, compared to similar restaurants I'd eaten at in the city. My wife has a gluten allergy and has trouble, at most restaurants, having any type of selection. When we told the manager of this she brought Chef Eric to our table. He couldn't have been more accommodating. He made a special sauce for the appetizer dish my wife selected, and then made similar ingredient changes for her main course. During the meal he and the manager both came to our table to check if all was satisfactory. This is the type of service and caring you see at a nose-bleed priced restaurant. The Dempsey Cookhouse and Bar should be on the short list for anyone who wants a great meal, gluten allergy or not, at reasonable prices

came for mother's day celebration. food selection was decent, a little overpriced for the standard. A little disappointed that the waiter had to rush us through the starters for no other reason then to clear the table. Other then that, service was attentive and atmosphere was nice - simple and classy. would come back

We are very excited this restaurant opened up in Singapore. It gives us hope that other fine restaurants here can provide delicious food along with good service. The Dempsey Cookhouse does it all and is also a beautiful restaurant with easy parking. I have been several times in the past month and each time it does not disappoint. The food and drinks are very tasty and well presented. The menu is creative and tasty. And there is a large wait staff milling around to assist when needed. Unlike most Singapore restaurants you do not need to wait long periods to flag someone down for assistance. The Cookhouse has a large and aware staff, who are walking the floor and seem to know when to refill your water, ask if you want another drink and bring your various food courses. Everything I have ordered has been very good, from appetisers to mains to desserts. Nothing disappoints. It is a sheer delight to have this restaurant here and we wish you much success

We finally managed to book this place for dinner. It's usually very full. The decor is simple and classy. We had the tuna tartare with caviar, foie gras, and pizza, with white wine. I guess it was good we decided to share everything because the food was very rich (tasty rich).We would come back to try the other selections. It is great that new and good restaurants have sprung up again in Dempsey!

we went there on Labour day and restaurants were mostly filled -its a beautiful high ceiling colonial room. Overall service staffs are very good - they are mainly experienced staffs from what we noticed. The food are very good also except for the Fish Tacos - i wouldn't recommend. the taco was a little soggy - and the taste are not that great

Great place. Interior is wonderful. Staff and chef was helpful. Food got me speechless. The beef with hot sauce sauce was my favorite. Would definitely come back.

From the welcome, to the service from Joey, the prompt arrival of share plates, then just the right break before our mains of salmon (with a divine truffle jus) and ricotta pasta, then a decent break before yummy desserts. A pavlova and a frangipanni tart shone as did crab dumplings and calamari at the outset. I asked for the Chef to cook the salmon as he felt it should be. A winning touch, unasked the waitress reports back the Chef recommends medium on this dish and I concurred happily. Wine is never cheap in Singapore, so the quality of a clever wine list is appreciated with a rousanne marsanne blend from the Barossa a standout. A French Pinot by the glass was a flavoursome whilst light way to end the dinner. And all this before I mention the room, wow. Just wow. A converted cookhouse, literally, that served the barracks during the war. It now houses this modern day Californian influenced eatery, inside with a clean outdoorsy feel of white and plants and big lights hanging from high, high ceilings. Also under the same roof, a bar, a tempura counter and stools, plus the divine Peranakan hit, Michelin-starred Candlenut. Dempsey Cookhouse is flawless with a fresh approach to Singapore dining and a fabulous ambience. The tables turn over throughout the night. Don't worry about dining windows, because this machine is so well-oiled that it all works seamlessly. Thank you Chloe, Clifton, Joey firstly for introducing yourselves and all the team for a first-rate performance. Singapore just went up a notch with this casual yet sophisticated cuisine and venue. Barely two or three months old and already smoothly in its groove. Uber cool

Happily got a table when we went by at lunch time without a reservation. Cool and pleasant place with the high ceilings and generous table spacing and setting. Lunch menu had ala carte and several set lunches with a wide choice of dishes.Service was good except for the occasional jar of 'no problem' reply by one or two wait staff. If there is one training tip for all service staff it would be , do not ever say 'no problem' to a customer. If there was a problem, the customer would likely not be there in the first place.Otherwise table service was good. The kitchen service was poor. Not wanting a full lunch, we opted for 2 al carte main course items and it took perhaps 20-25 minutes for it to be served and when it was ready, it was taken to the next table. We caught the attention of the staff and finally had our lunch.Beef tenderloin and the beef burger were good and the pavlova dessert was excellent

This latest addition to the F&B scene serves good quality food and creative cocktails in a lovely setting. Their portions of desserts are most generous I have ever had and their excellent service made our dining experience ever so memorable. It is totally understandable why their tables are taken up on weekends and the strict timings they imposed for each seating

Time was when Dempsey wasn't exactly famous for high quality dining, but that has been changing in recent years. The Dempsey Cookhouse is another milestone on the way. The interior designers did a great job: leaving the high ceilings but partially filling the space overhead with large lampshades. The feeling is light, spacious, and airy. It helps that the tables have not been crammed in to maximise seating. As a single diner without a reservation, I accepted a seat at the bar (I prefer to sit down to my meals - not up) and didn't regret it. The long marble top, large array of bottles with overhanging greenery make an interesting place to eat and drink. The service was impeccable.My foie gras starter was seared just right, and served with a finger of toasted brioche and some apple sauce. The main of roasted cod was perfectly cooked and the verdant and piquant sauce a different, but very appropriate accompaniment, without overwhelming the delicate fish flavours.The only disappointing note was the wine. There is a fair selection by the glass, and I tried the Sauternes with the foie gras: it was okay, but nothing special - of course, one shouldn't expect much "special" at the price, but Sauternes is generally underpriced, and I think that there must be much better options at the same price point. The South African gewurztraminer I tried with the fish was hugely disappointing: no freshness, and none of the vibrant floral notes that should make gewurtz so enjoyable. It tasted as though it had travelled to Singapore overland on a donkey!For this level of dining, the prices were very reasonable.I shall definitely be returning

Beautifully appointed, elegant without being stuffy with comfortable unique chairs.The appetisers were superb - burrata cheese, foie gras with lychee purÃ©e, prawn salad. Lobster bisque was unusual served with mashed potatoes and sourdough bits. Ciabatta bread was full of character and was nicely complemented by the olive oil and salt. Truffle pizza is highly recommended. The lamb shank main was amazing - the meat was so tender, it peeled off the bone. We loved the Bomb Alaska ice cream dessert but it's a large serving after a big meal so I'd recommend sharing. Service was helpful and warm.

I was invited to meet a friend here for dinner and I must say the ambiance and food was very good--mind you I really like Jean Georges restauarants so settling in was very easy. I found the food surprisingly well priced by Singapore standards, lets see if they do what Spago did and put up their prices a couple of months after launch by 20%. The wines were crazy expensive, be prepared to pay over $100 for a Rioja, which drives me crazy and it did again!I really like the ambiance, this restaurant is a very welcome addition to an eating area in a part of town I am not really fond of going. Bar area is very nicely done, good job guys. The only screw up is the staff is all over the place, normal kind of chaos for a new place but they should do some more training for sure. We waited a while for the check to come, then the manager came and wanted the table back so we had to tell him the credit card was sent 15 minutes ago, he went to track that down and found it sitting on a service table!I am going to try the brunch in a couple of weeks, the menu looks great and hopefully the service is a bit better
