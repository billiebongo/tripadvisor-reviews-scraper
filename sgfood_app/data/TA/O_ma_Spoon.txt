Disgusting toasted sandwich. Tasted like plastic. Ordered two but brought out one sandwich. You only get a half.

For those who love ‚ù§Ô∏è PatBingsu. Surely you'll be spoilt for choice. They also offer other desserts and drinks so check it out. The one we went to was at Marina SquareüòÄ.

I just love it! My fave is the one with mango. I forget the name for my niece was the one who ordered it for me. Been to this place couple of time during my visits to Singapore. It is just simply.... yummy!

Back to Oma Spoon it is for bingsu and although they no longer serve the OMG Bingsu from Friday to Sunday, I have found a new favourite in the coffee bingsu!

Located in trendy 313@Somerset, O'ma Spoon serves the best Bingsu (Korean Shave Ice) in Singapore in terms of freshness and variety. The shave ice is powdered snow fresh and ingredients and toppings are freshly prepared and there are plenty of variety to choose from. While tasty by itself, you can drench the bingsu with condensed milk to kick it up a notch. Staff are friendly and helpful. Great and super hip place to hangout with friends and family and you can get good free wifi reception from 313@Somerset

Great service! I had first asked to try out some mango fruit to see if it was sweet; since it was up to my liking, I ordered a mango cheesecake bingsu- it was a nice surprise! An actual slice of cheesecake on top of my bingsu. Some blueberries on the bottom layer. Extra condensed milk on the side. Yum!

The search continues for great bingsu. While there is a nice selection of flavours with petit sized options available for individual servings - this didn't hit the spot. Which is a pity as this would have made a great spot to hang out with excellent service and friendly staff.

Came here and went for a mango cheesecake Bingsu. It cost almost $19. We shared it between 3 people which was about right for such a large dessert.Place very busy and popular. Clean and efficient service.Top half is quite good, with mango, cheesecake, ice cream and a layer of cherry. Bottom half is quite boring just shaved ice and milk.Interesting to try a Korean dessert ..... once ....

I've tried bingsu at numerous Korean eateries in Singapore (at Bingki, Chicken Up etc) and have never found it worth the calories. But O'ma spoon has really impressed me, even though the price tag for each bingsu would make you feel the pain on your wallet. I find that I often have to add a couple extra extra cups of milk to sweeten the bingsu. The toppings are top notch - especially the base ingredient (frozen milk shavings) being exceptionally smooth and deliciously tasty

My wife and I are a big fan of Korean cuisine. While other places offered excellent Korean food, we tried to find the most authentic bingsu and finally found this place. The price might be slightly higher than average prices of dessert but this bingsu was very delicious and plenty for two people. We found that this bingsu was also very close to the ones served in Korea

Spent $58 for 2 bingsu and 5 cups of warm Yuzu drink. Bingsus were nice but the tea was really average. Trolls of teenagers patrol this shop at Somerset 313.

Brilliant! Light! Scrumptious! I could skip a meal for this hahaIf you love ice cream, then you've got to try this at least once. We had the Green Tea, Choco Brownie and Injeolmi Bingsu. All yummy, but the best is the Injeolmi and Green Tea

Located very conveniently in Somerset MRT and it is a place to stop by for having dessert after a delicious meal at the food court. We opted for the Petit Bingsu and it was absolutely heavenly. The mangoes were so fresh and succulent. It was an awesome experience.The place is usually packed on weekends so we were lucky to grab a table. Must give this place a shot for a unique Korean experience

Had the Oreo & Mango bingsu. Very delicious & creamy. I was surprised at how smooth & creamy the ice shavings are. You wouldn't even know you are eating an ice based dessert as the shavings are so milky & really like snowflakes. We were given condensed milk shots if we wanted to make the dessert sweeter, but we didn't need them as the taste is already balanced & great as it is. We've passed by this shop a few times before and always found a long line for the order. We were able to get a table on a Saturday afternoon without waiting. Would love to try the traditional flavours next time

We have been enjoying shaved-ice since we were kids and these memories still reminds us once in awhile of our younger days....until I discovered something else in Singapore...the Korean Bingsu!!! They come in a lot of flavors all well thought of. But the one I like best is their Mango Cheesecake Bingsu...this is the description of that particular taste of heaven...underneath, a layer of yogurt with fruit dressing topped with fine shaved now ice, then topped with layers of fresh mangoes, again topped with a scoop of cashew ice cream, covered with nuts and dried cranberries + a slice of cheesecake...all sitting a bowl one layer after another. Before you start, you need to pour in a shot of what looked like as a creamy milk....i have attached a picture for your discretion...Enjoy :-)

I was at marina square outlet and ordered the petite bingsu with mango toppings.it cost 5.50. Honestly the shaved ice was fine but not sweet for my liking.mango cubes were fresh and sweet but too little.i like the comfy seats and sentimental western music..perhaps can give free syrup to top over the bibgsu to make it tastier
4
Ordered the OMG bingsu for sharing between 8 person.. Literally OMG I've never seen a bigger bowl of bingsu anywhere else before.. I love the injeolmi & Oreo flavor and I find it extremely valuable to order this size for group sharing, we actually couldn't even finish it. The ice flakes tasted rather fine.. The condensed milk was slightly diluted but I guess that's fine because the toppings on the bingsu is already quite sweet on its own. It's free seating and can get rather crowded especially in later in the evening, have to be prepared to wait for tables.

Tried the mango cheesecake bingsu which costs $18.90. It is a little disappointing that the size of the bingsu is a little small (maybe enough just for 2 or 3 pax). For that regular size bingsu, it is a little pricey (for $18.90). They have other sizes such as the petit and OMG, etc. OMG size bingsu is really OMG because the portion is really big and can be shared around among 4 or 5 people.The shaved ice is really fine and nice. Reach to the bottom part of the bingsu and it tastes really good and sweet. The shaved ice is not the normal ice but milk flakes. Very nice but the mango is a little sour at times.Nice cafe to enjoy bingsu and chatting with friends. Avoid peak hours to get a seat as it is always full during peak hours

Been here few times and still loves it so much. Tried the berries bingsu and green tea bingsu. Preferred green tea bingsu the most. We ordered the green tea bingsu without nuts due to myself is allergy to nuts. It taste better with the almond nuts. Yummy
5
O'ma Spoon's bingsu is made of milk flakes and its taste is something I find very outstanding as compared to other bingsu places. The 'very berry bingsu' and 'mango cheesecake bingsu' are to die for! The portion is also pretty huge, good to share among 2-3 pax. What's even more interesting is that they also have the 'OMG bingsu', which is literally OMG as it's a combination of 3 different bingsu flavours in a huge bowl, good to share among bigger group of friends! Love this place and would definitely recommend to everyone who wants to try the best Bingsu in Singapore
4
The matcha bingsu is definitely a treat! The portion is good to share between 2-3 people. Try to come during off peak hours so you'll get a good seat and faster service. Anytime before 6pm is usually good!
4
Fine texture of soybean and chewy texture of mochi bits with big bowl. Enough for 2 persons. Mostly youngster visiting the outlet. Refreshing dessert after dinner.
4
Ordered the OMG bingsu. 3 flavor; chocolate, matcha & peanut (?). A little difficult to finish for four people so might be best for 5 or more for a gathering.
4
We had the chocolate brownie shaved ice. Was disappointed by the tiny serving of chocolate brownie.
The ice is very soft and fine and its generous serving of oreo biscuit was good. For that price, I expected more brownies.

In Summary:My favourite bingsu caf√©!*DETAILED REVIEW BELOW*Background:I was initially sceptical when I heard of this ‚ÄúNumber 1‚Äù bingsu spot. I was pretty convinced after my first try and have been returning frequently since.1. Service ‚Äì 5 out of 5I always order the OMG Bingsu over ther. Hence, they do serve and they are nice about it!2. Ambience ‚Äì 5 out of 5Nice and homely environment!3. Cleanliness ‚Äì 5 out of 5Trays and spoons not sticky, unlike some other bingsu safe where you have to self collect your bingsu, and perhaps wash your own spoon since there are always so sticky.4. Taste ‚Äì 5 out of 5My personal favourite, but I am spoilt for choice with three different flavours in one bingsu.5. Value for Money - 5 out of 5Applies only for the OMG bingsu. Feeds up to 5 ‚Äì 6 food buddies. For ladies with anorexia tendencies, it may feed 10. If you find bingsu expensive, I do agree and I will recommend our local alternative instead - the ice kachang, found at economical prices almost everywhere other than Kopitiam

This was my second visit. The biggest thing in favour of O'ma Spoon is that it gives Petit Bingsu for $5.50 (with one topping). Most other Bingsu places have only large portions, which need to be shared between 2 or 3 people, not very convenient. Bingsu is good. The red bean paste was just nice. They need to add more flavour options in their Petit offering. We have to ask for condensed milk if we find it less sweet. They do not give condensed milk on side like other Bingsu places.

I've tried the following before: Pat bingsu petite, Matcha bingsu, Choco brownie bingsu, and Mango bingsu. My personal favourite was the matcha bingsu, while the mango bingsu was my least favourite due to the usage of sour mangoes instead of sweet ones. The regular portion was enough for 2-3 people to share, while the petite one was just nice for one person.The price is a little high, but the satisfaction is great. Be sure to grab & pour their milk onto the bingsu before digging in! And fortunately, they allow you to take second servings for the milk. ;)Opening hours daily: 11:00am - 09:30p

We tried the Injeolmi bingsu and we like it! The finely ice shaven bingsu was served in a bowl covered with soybean powder + almond and rice cake toppings. Before you tuck in, you gotta drizzle a shot of milk onto your bingsu. Be careful not to over pour like we did. (Oops!)Spoonful after spoonful of light milk shaved ice in soybean flavor with sometimes almonds and sometimes rice cake make a very satisfying dessert. The toppings gave a chewy/crunchy texture but at the same time I love how the chunk of shaved ice melted in my mouth! This outlet's Bingsu standard was similar to the one I had in Korea (Ìò∏Î∞ÄÎ∞≠) other than the rice cake, which I thought was less chewy, but the overall's taste was still comparable. (p.s. You might wanna be careful on your first mouthful, if it's your first time trying, as I chocked on my first mouthful of powdery soybean and then later on my bf did too.)

Choco brownie Bingsu is okay.... Sharing with 5 persons it costs $18.90. The most expensive dessert I ever have. The ice flakes looks like coconut flakes, milky white and not melting easily, that makes this dessert pretty unique. The taste of it quite milk and yet you still can taste the milk flakes. Overall just so so to me. Will try the baked bread next time

Bingsus have taken over Singapore by storm, and for a good reason! They are not just shaved ice; they are Korean-branded desserts that are guaranteed to please your taste buds with its rich flavours and smooth texture!O'ma Spoon offers many rich and enticing flavours, but my friends and I decided to opt for the Green Tea Bingsu and the Choco Brownie Bingsu for the night. Both bingsus are delicious, and of course, they melt in your mouth ever so gracefully. The service was pretty fast too, despite the crowd. However, do come early to get seats, or you might end up waiting for quite some time. Still, this dessert caf√© is worth the wait, especially if you are one who has a sweet tooth and a dessert craving waiting to be fulfilled
