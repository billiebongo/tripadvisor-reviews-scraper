Super cool restaurant, the furniture were recycled and had a super vintage vibe. We went for lunch and the lunch set was yummy.

I m a regular customer of this restaurant. The owner is always very friendly. The decoration and ambient is great for Friday gathering. Food is always good! I like the blossom onion and beef rib the most

As usual was always very good service and the waitress was friendly and very attentive. The food is great especially the rib eye steak.

Nice atmosphere with nice decorations however location was not so good for people who does not drive. Food to try Onion Blossom!!!

Was lucky enough to visit the place when there was a Harley meet up and the bikers were doing their bit for charity, so I chipped in my small contributions. The food was good, beer cold, and music loud. Nothing much to ask for.

The decor at this place is much better than in the old sembawang area! Waiter was kind enough to offer the split of the sausage platter after knowing that a couple of us cannot take beef! Great service!

A great end to a tough walk over the Southern Ridges Trail. An interesting decor with famous musicians' guitars and some impressive Harleys & Ducatis. Good beer (very good draught Guinness) and other drinks. We had 2 plates of cheesy chips and a plate of wedges which were so good we ordered more. Burgers looked good

Went there on a Sunday evening & the place was pleasantly quiet and quaint. Loved the ambience, unique deco & the food was great as well! Had the grilled chicken which was juicy despite having to wait a little longer and the blossom onion was super good! Will definitely come back for another meal in the near future! Wonderful service to

Had a Tomahawk steak which was good enough for 4 of us.Went well with beer and wine.Suggest that you order a couple of side dishes like vegetables and fries and you will have a nice full meal.Casual and relaxed and the waiters try their best to please.Definitely worth a visit

Premise - no aircon. Open air. So be warned. Nice and all but it's open concept may be unforgiving.Food - awesome. Very ingenious names given to the dishes. And they taste good. Ribs. Wings. Broccoli Fritos. Beers. Very good in all.Staff - friendly and helpful. No complaints.Crowd - dinner time on weekday so more working crowd. But can imagine good weekend family goers.Verdict - in all slightly expensive but portions are good. Come here when it's evening when it's not hot. Not much shelter here.

Ordered this dish and it was amazing! Would recommend to share it among a group of 4-5 at least as friend and I had trouble finishing even half of it due to its size though it's actually an appetizer!

Overall experiences it great, just the variety of food is not a lot. A great place to hang out, thumb up the custom made furniture, very ingenious.

Nice cool place with nice food. The bikes there makes one of my friend wanted to take up class 2 license.

I decided to bring my boyfriend here for his birthday and have used Chope to reserve a place. However, upon arrival... They said they never got my reservation. Thankfully there were plenty of seats as we were there before the dinner crowd. Despite the slight hiccup, the food was amazing and service was pretty top-notch too. I would recommend sitting inside as it does get a bit hot and humid outside

We decided to do a bicycle ride on Sunday morning and made a quick stop at The Handle Bar in Gillman Barracks [this is a biker restaurant] and what a pleasant surprise, firstly the décor and layout of this restaurant is outstanding and very unique and very original and displays the biker theme very strongly and was really struck by the amount of detail and effort that went into the design and the them – one word Awesome.We ordered the chicken wings [even the menu has some strange and exotic names], luckily we did not order the strong wings and order the very “weak” these were nice and spicy and we topped them up with some fries.Even though this was a short visit we really enjoyed this visit and will certainly be back again for a longer visit as there is a “good vibe” here and could become a regular for us

The chicken wings were awesome and so were the ribs! The blossom onion and jalepenos just whet the appetite and we had double servings of both! With great food and drinks around, the conversation just kept going and going, with very attentive service staff. Can't ask for a better night out at Handlebar

Went there for the lunch specials and the selection on the menu was good. My friends and I ordered different items to share and the overall quality was good. However, service was very limited and disappointing. There were 2 waiting staff and only my group of friends but we ended up having to help ourselves most of the time because we could never find the staff. With similar competition in the area in terms of food, service can be a differentiator and it was unfortunate that Handlebar did not try to shine in this area.
5
Food was of standard and the service was great! Two of us ordered the Pork Chop but my friend's pork chop was done much better than mine. When I requested for a change, they did a new piece for me immediately! The steak and fish & chips were nicely done too :

Nice place to hang up with your friends or family. western type of restaurant but hope they can add on pasta inside the menu as well. Staff quite friendly and the whole restaurant look cool and fantastic, especially the motorbikes just right in front of the road.

A group of us came here last night for some snacks and drinks. We went with no expectations but had such a great night! Don't go looking for any fancy frills, but if you want a good burger and some scrummy margaritas within a unique setting, then this is a great option. Good for groups, safe for kids and pets welcome too. They were also showing sports on a big outdoor projector. Something a bit different for Singapore. The bikers in our group were suitably impressed with the handiwork and interior design
