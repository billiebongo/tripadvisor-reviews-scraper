Great place for bbq roast pork, northern Indian naan and chicken or hokkien noodle (late afternoon only )
3
My local foodie friend brought me here. A couple of things he zoomed for : tong fong fatt chicken rice, yi sheng hokkien noodles, jin jin chendol. Seems like there's plenty of other good stuff too

Very popular local Tze Char stall. Dishes are less saltish than most that I've tried and taste are not compromised. The hardworking owners definitely deserve kudos for serving delicious food (with great wok hei)at affordable local prices . Great Job !

After being pretty disappointed with the Duck Noodles from Fatty Cheong being too salty, I decided to try another stall: Sin Heng Kee Chicken Rice ¬∑ Char Siew Roasted Meat & Roast Duck Rice Êñ∞ËààË®òÊµ∑ÂçóÈõûÈ£Ø ¬∑ ÂèâÁáí ¬∑ ÁáíËÇâÈ£Ø ¬∑ È¥®È£Ø ( nearby at #01-34) that has a similar menu, & a steady stream of customers lining up to place their orders. Unfortunately they don't have noodles, only rice - which is a bummer for a noodle-lover like me..But I was happy that this is pretty value for money! $5 Duck Leg Rice, $1 extra Char Siew, $0.50 Tofu + $0.50 full hard-boiled egg (the portion here is halved cos I shared it with my dad). The soup is already included, & is the cabbagey kind you expect with chicken rice (not usually duck rice).You can also swap out your regular plain white rice for chicken rice at no additional cost... Trust me, it's worth it. So tasty that it actually makes me want to try their actual Chicken Rice. (& I don't EVER feel like eating chicken rice!

Almost everything you want from spore local food, you can get here. It‚Äôs crowded n finding a seat might not be easy. You can spot the better food stalls by the queues extending for them. Very good good n of course value for money. A must go place for local hawker food.
5
The selection of food here is amazing! I chose to eat Taiwan edema porridge today. The food is fantabulous! Don't miss the chendol, claypot rice and Teochew fishball noodles!!!The char siew at Fatty Cheong is also damn shiok! This place is just unbelievable!!! ;D

Review by Dr Sim. Good hawker centre. I enjoy Wow western food. The beef steak, pork chop and chicken chops are great. Power Chendol is also great at the dessert stall. I cannot remember the name. Look for the long queue. No air-conditioning. Regards Dr Si

One of The Best Economical Local Hawker Place. Very Value for money. No frills and wide local selections. very affordable and reasonable pricing. My favourite - vegetarian only at $2!!! Must try.

Tiong Bahru Fried Hokkien Mee, Techew Fish Ball, Wild Wild West Western Food, Bakery, Few good Zhe Zhar stalls
3
Google maps says 24 hours but this place is open to around 1am, with most of the stalls closed by around 8pm. The choice here is wide. Stay away from the spicy chicken unless you love it really spicy.
4
I like the fried Hokkien prawn noodles especially the sambal chilli that comes with it. There is usually a long queue waiting at the stall so I would normally call to order half an hour before I arrive. There are stalls selling delicious roast pork rice, Claypot rice, Penang laksa, Penang fried Kway teow, satay beehoon and desserts like chendol, ice jelly cocktail and Ê¶¥ËäíÂÜ∞(durian mango ice), all of which are my favourites.ABC is a great place to enjoy local hawker fare at affordable prices
3
With a reputation for good local dishes especially Chinese version at this location. Food is tasty and more than reasonable. The Claypot was very good and so was the herbal chicken soup and pork meat patties .It's a lunch crowd Favourite if you managed to get a seat. Dinner is more subdue and nevertheless still warm and humid. No picture for this one. Lunch time watch the crowded to see what you should eat, dinner read the many reviews readily avail online.

ABC Brickworks Market & Food Centre has about approx. 100 stalls that serves a wide variety of food, I did not physically count them, but with 16 stalls per row times 6 columns. . . you get the numbers. There is a Halal food row for the Muslim, Thai food stall, Western food stall, Claypot Rice(sic), Herbal Soup stalls, 4 or 5 Chicken rice stalls and a rather famous Dessert store along with a Fried Hokkien Mee store with very long queues.Long queue here means 10 or more persons in front of you on a busy day/ weekend.According to what I know, these famous stall have also been featured in local newspaper or magazines. I have tried these famous stores on some occasions where the queue is shorter and I have found that it really does live up to the hype. If you are patient, you can try queuing under sweltering weather, but rest assured you will get your food and not go home empty handed because it is sold out

A go to place for local food that won't disappoint. Stall 01-126 is a nice zi char (local home cooked dishes eaten with rice or porridge) option. Tonight we packed a omelette with chai-po, long beans with dried shrimp and chilli, braised pork with preserved veg (Ê¢ÖËèúÊâ£ËÇâ)Ôºåsalted egg coated chicken bits, beancurd with minced pork and baby kai lan. Had it with white steam rice. We also packed a small claypot rice (Á†ÇÈîÖÈ•≠) to suppplement. The food at this cooked food market doesnt disappoint. Soak in the atmosphere on local hawker food. But be prepared, Its crowded, hot
4
Came here after a disappointing dinner at Authetic Mun Chee Kee Pig organs eating stall at Jalan Besar. We feasted in BBQ chicken wings n a couple of hawker dishes before washing them down with chendol Very satisfying n the place was cleaned n tables cleared n the service was fast n good value for money. Can find almost any type of local food here n ample car park lots too

ABC Brickworks is one of the best food centers in Singapore - food-wise. There are many famous food stalls with delicious food. Even the not-so-famous ones serve good food. I ordered mixed pork congee with an additional raw egg ($4.30) today from Congee Delights (#01-45), and beef slices and tendon noodles dry ($5) from Chinatown Beef King (#01-115). Both were yummy. The congee's consistency was smooth; the ingredients were fresh. The beef noodles was tasty too. Tendon melted in the mouth though I wish they wouldn't use meat tenderizer on the beef slices. Always a good meal in ABC Brickworks!Be prepared that there's no air-conditioning and the place is humid and warm though!

Located near to the Redhill MRT Station and within walking distance, this food centre has many good food outlets. There's Jason's Penang Laksa, Fatty Cheong Roast and many more to try not forgetting the delicious power chendol from Jin Jin Dessert. Very reasonably Prive and won't hurt your pocket much. Of course, you must bear with the missing ambience and you have to go self-service and queue for your food
4
This market has the big food court...
Very nice and you can try all local food in here.
You can have sourplum drink, very nice and cendol ice is one of should have try.
Enjoy and have a great day üòä.

Very fantastic food choices, prices and quality! Must try the chicken rice, vegetarian mee hoo, Lor Mee western food and Claypot rice. All very affordable below $5 and very yummy.

5
Best mee goreng in bukit merah area, their mee combo platter is simply fantastic. A must try for family n friends.

Great food. Lady boss not very friendly. She can smile more üòä portion size is fair with generous helpings of squid and prawns.

Very popular hawker centre with good variety of food from Chinese, Malay, Western (local hawker type) to Indian, you can definitely find something to suit your taste buds. Price is typical as other hawker centres. Place gets very crowded during lunch hours. Unfortunately this place is not near any MRT station. Not many tourists know or come to this place. It's actually located about 500m from Ikea Alexandra so I usually pop by if I am at Ikea.
4
This place is always packed during the lunch hour and on weekends due to the variety and quality of the hawker food stalls here. I always try random stalls whenever I visit and so far, everything is delicious to varying degrees.From typical Singaporean fare like char kway teow to chinese tze char or malay ayam penget, the sheer variety in local cuisine will leave you spoilt for choice.If you want an idea of what's really good amongst all the food stalls available, just look for the ones with the long snaking queues
2
2nd time trying our luck to find some dinner here. All except for 3 halal stalls were closed. Even the 3 were in the process of cleaning up and most of menu items are not available. The only reason to come here is for the power chendol. Even that, has dropped in standard. They also have to improve the standard of cleaning, with a litter strewn all over the floor
5
With thousands of "high class" restaurants in Singapore, I cannot help but compare the actual quality of food with those found in this amazing place! I quickly come to the conclusion that fine dining is really paying for the rental, location, the well dressed staff... Everything else but the food!The ABC food center contains some of the best eateries under one roof and the food puts to shame anything I have tried overseas in expensive hotels and restaurants. Don't forget to go to the drinks stall called Si Bei Cool and order the Michael Jackson. It's a 50/50 blend of soya and grass jelly.

This isn't the cleanest hawker center. However, I love the variety here. There are a lot of options from drinks to foods to desserts. There is a dessert stand that almost always has a long line so they must be good. I've had their desserts and they are good but I can't say they are special because I'm not an expert at Singaporean desserts.The thing I love most about this place is that it is so active even late at night. Places are busy as late as 8pm or 9pm. Although, I probably wouldn't go much later than 8 or 8:30pm. With so many hawkers that closer after lunch or by 6pm, it's really nice to go here for dinner. If you're a tourist? This is a good place to go however it isn't easily accessible by public transport. You'd have to take the Green Line and then take a short bus ride or walk. You can also take a taxi. It's more of an authentic hawker in my opinion whereas I think places like Lau Pa Sat and Newton and Satay by the Bay are all geared towards tourists with tourist pricing. I have not been here for breakfast or lunch but I'd imagine it's good to go at those times, especially lunch

Had the best char siew in ages at Fatty Cheong's. meat was tender and juicy. Sauce was think and just right in sweetness.
4
A nice place to unwind after a hectic day in SIN... Great Cappuccino served together the an almond Croissant.
4
This hawker centre houses the best stall for the local dessert of chendol (Jin Jin) amongst others for a good variety of local food.
5
Roasted.meat.is.to.die.for. But that's just the one store near that ATM. There's too much of a variety of awesome food here. You'll be hard-pressed to find a seat during lunch time, so do come early. I can't recommend it enough.
4
The brown sugar & coconut milk are very tasty, and the chendol very springy. So guys when you visit ABC Brickworks you should try this dessert.
4
Visited this food centre for breakfast during my staycation at Park Alexandra Hotel. It opens quite early and has a variety of food choices, for example fried carrot cake and lor mee (it's a kind of noodles in dark brown gravy). For tourists who wants to try out local food, hawker centre is a place not to be missed.
4
Our first time here at the ABC Brickworks hawker centre with friends for dinner before attending a wake close by. We were told there were lots of good food here so we're not too sure what to eat. Decided on the fishball noodle from Bee Lock Ting as well as the ever popular chendol from Jin Jin and we were not disappointed. Will come back to try out the other specialties.

The ABC Brickworks market is a local Hawker type affair, I ate there numerous times over the week I was in Singapore watching Stoke City in the Barclay Asia trophy 2015. The food was fresh , prepared in front of you by very friendly staff. I payed 5SGD for the most expensive meal there and more often thsn not it was 3SGD a meal. Beer was 6SGD for a large bottle of Tiger or Singha very good value at an expensive place for beer. The owners were friendly, the tables were cleaned regularly and I would recommend anyone visiting Singapore to pay it a visit. A fantastic place to meet the locals and enjoy a friendly meal

They have sausage set.Good selection of Muslim & Indian food

OK I am a Hawker Stall Junkie, this is one of the greatest eating places in Singapore, great food and very cheap eating. It's clean and if you can't find it here you better head for the airport. Our son and family live in Singapore, in the last couple visits they have had us everywhere. While there are many great eating places we really enjoy ABC. Of course this isn't FINE DINNING, just the best food at a great price, and very friendly people
