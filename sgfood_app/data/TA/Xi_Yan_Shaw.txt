Enjoyed almost every dish ordered! The vegetables with eggs three way was really delicious too. standard portions were good for four to five ppl to share.
5
Prompt And courteous service. Food was good. Serving size is good for small groups. Good place to gather friends.
4
I am back to Xi Yan Shaw again as the food is tastefully creative with new dishes and affordable. Service is not bad.
5
Ordered the dan dan noodles and the Yong Dao fu soup. It was superb. I didn't have the msg effect though the dishes are tasty. My first visit as recommended by my frd at this branch and will visit again.
4
Nice food though portions rather small for the price.
Service adequate but rather noisy given the open setting and low ceiling.
4
We had the daily soup, steamed cod on rice noodles etc and tang yuen for desserts. Restaurant was full and noisy!
5
The choice of food was amazing and all dishes we ordered were exquisite. Especially loved the Yong Dao Fu, Fried Radish Cake, Dou Miao. Service was impeccable, and I thoroughly enjoyed the experience. A nice affordable and casual restaurant with great food. I only wish they didnt charge for wate
4
Xi Yan Shaw is having a different approach and image as compared to Xi Yan Private Dining in Craig Road. Xi Yan Shaw is focusing on casual dining for family and small gatherings with lower pricing and wide variety for the diners. Out of the 6 dishes we ordered and only 1 dish which we found to be below our expectation. In general, we think it is a value for money dining venue.

It was our first time to Xi Yan restaurant in Singapore though we have been to a few of their outlets in HK. The one in Singapore has been localised I reckon to suit the local tastebuds. However the service was good but food was a bit pricey. The zhejiang tang chu pai koo and the si ji dou was ok but the kou sui ji came shredded instead of whole slices and white noodle had a strong ginger taste.
1
Had lunch on 27 Dec, restaurant was 50% full upon our visit, only 2 waitress on duty. Stood at entrance for 5 minutes, in the end walked in and asked for 2 seats. All customers had to look for waitress in order to place order. Requested for sauce, got to remind twice. Food quality and portion had dropped tremendously, clearly tastes msg and chicken stock which is available from supermarket. Prices are incredibly high with quality of food. Must take into consideration that everything thing is service charge (compulsory tips)!Perhaps this outlet is ready to close down in no time.
4
not my first time at XI YAN SHAW, tried their fried rice this round, its extremely tasty and portion was gd enough for 3 pax. their coconut ice cream dessert with pudding was quite gd as well.
5
Great foods all tge fiids are very nice...
Clean place soft music.....
Nice stuffs cool..
We'll come again.
4
the food was good, except for the salted egg squid was quite disappointing.
the price is reasonable.
this is singapore, short-handed is common.
5
Visited Xi Yan Shaw again after some time. The food quality is still good. We loved the steamed cod fish fillet with rice noddles. Soup of the day is also value for money. Service was fast and the staff is attentive.
4
Food was served quite fast,considering the night crowd. Food was presented well. We like the fried beehoon w pork leg very much.
5
Was trying to find an affordable place for lunch with the kids but not more of the same-old. Decided to go back to Xiyan. The restaurant delighted us with its Hakka food. Tasty. Kids loved it.
3
Service and food are both good but the whole place is simply too cold for comfort. The food turned cold after 3 mins upon arrival!
5
Great Chinese fusion food in Shaw Center. The Pregnant Woman Fried Rice is highly recommended. The combination of olive, dried radish and dry shrimps are perfect. Simply mind blowing due to the uniqueness.
The eggplant and pork patties are good choices too.
4
The food presentation is OK. The general taste especially the Water Chestnut and Pomelo Salad is above average. Customer service is good.
4
@TheKuoKnowsHakka cuisine is still a bit of a rarity in Singapore. It shouldnâ€™t be. But it is.Xi Yan Shaw on Scotts Road is a real credit to Hakka style cooking. It is the simplicity that makes it so delicious. Hats off to the chef.The Zheng Jiang Vinegar Spare Ribs are melt-in-the mouth delicious. The Fried Squid in Salted Egg Yolk is beyond superb. The Hakka Abacus Mushrooms are definitely worth a try too.Service is top drawer. The food was despatched from kitchen to table without too much delay, even though it was a busy lunchtime.Xi Yan Shaw gets a big thumbs-up from me. Can wait for the next visit, which I am hoping will be very soon
4
We enjoyed the seafood beehoon and the rest of the food. Ambience was nice yet casual which was a perfect setting for meet ups with friends.
5
Authentic and uncommon Hokkien and Cantonese dishes with a flair - don't miss the pig trotters fried bee hoon and yong tau foo.
4
Dishes were reasonably priced and food were tasty. However, seemed to be slow in service although it is a small restaurant.
4
The food was very delicious, and the flavours were mostly on point. We loved almost all the dishes we ordered, and the desserts were good as well. We will definitely head back there for another meal in future.
4
We shared a number of dishes and were happy with them all. Most memorable was the cheese wings. Staff were friendly and efficient.
5
We came back with friends and everyone packed a dish back to share with their family cuz it's SOOO good.
4
It is a place that I will recommend - Be it with friends or family, small or big group.The dishes are unique and some are 'traditional' that remind me of home cooked food by our grannies. Don't miss out the desserts - I love the "tang-yuen" especially. Staffs were friendly and service was prompt. Price was reasonable - around $35 per paxOverall, it is a place that I will visit always.
4
Xiyan used to have dishes that are delightful surprises, but these days, it's just a nice reliable place for comfort food.The service has dipped as well, from warm and competent staff to those who don't really know their stuff and instead of finding out, try to get by with calling everyone "帥哥" "美女", which is a tad low and a major turnoff.
3
This was our second visit and we left feeling disappointed. At 7 p.m. had already run out of their daily special, the Ginger Chicken as well as their roast chicken. The pork trotter with bee hoon was also not available. The deep fried pork belly was tough like leather. We ordered another daily special, the prawn balls; the serving consisted of 4 pieces round balls, each diameter was not bigger than a 20cent coin! The pea sprouts though tasty were stringy ie old shoots. The abacus beads and cai poh kuay teow were tasty but oily. Not sure if we will ever be back
3
went for dinner at Xi Yan shaw. saw pictures of the dishes and decided to try out. We ordered a few recommended dishes to share. we did not like any of the dishes at all. perhaps people who enjoy sweet chinese dishes might like them???Hakka marinated duck with sweet sauce, salivating spicy chicken are ok, sort of tasted as what we expected. although not something that we would come back for, but at least tasted ok.Disappointingly, tofu with crispy cai po and XO minced meat with eggplant were both pretty sweet. Even Dan Dan noodles tasted sweet. These dishes are not supposed to be sweet. Dan Dan noodles tasted like being mixed with peanut butter, and its not spicy even though we asked for spicy. sweet dishes tend to make us feel full very fast and after having all these sweet dishes, we no longer had any urge to have any dessert. because we were already overdosed with sugar.
4
Came here with my godma and we both thoroughly enjoyed the food. Every dish we ordered was good. Unfortunately we sat nxt to a very loud inconsiderate table debating a fmly issue which dampened our otherwise outstanding experience.
5
Very impressive!!! Must try the fried xo sauce cai po raddish cake & hakka marinated duck with sweet sauce!
5
Their crispy rice in fish broth is excellent. I can never have enough of it. Friendly staff also made the visit an enjoyable one.
4
the food was really good with different ethnic tastes, service was equally good! However the place is a bit small so it felt a bit congested.
4
Good food, ambience and service. Tried the bean curd with chai po and was surprised that the tofu was not at all salty. The crunchiness of the chai po goes very well with the tofu. Will be back again.
5
Dishes were very reasonably priced, considering how delicious and creative they are. A must try is the porridge!
5
Great prices and generous portions of interesting, uncommon but super shiok dishes. Much better concept than the original Xi Yan at Craig Road. So far, everyone I've brought here loved the food and swore they'd be back with their families.
4
The food is simply prepared but full of flavor. We had the salted duck, pork ribs, qing long veggies, mall tofu w preserved olives and pregnant woman fried rice. Our eyes were bigger than our stomachs! The food is full of strong flavors that are not shy about invading your taste buds. My favorite was the fried rice which had good texture and balance of flavors, completely unpretentious and meant to sate hungry people (no I'm not pregnant)
3
Overall food was good with valued lunch set meal. However the services there wasn't pleasant due to some error of order taking but the food was being replaced immediately. Followed by the service request, we requested to serve our dessert after main course, but they serve oppositely where they brought the serving for one of my friend that haven't finish the main course and clear the bowl before asking. The service attitude should have a certain level of improvement.
5
I enjoyed the food served in Xi Yan. I've brought 2 groups of friends there and their comments are the food is special and delicious. The staff are friendly and make good recommendations so we do not over order and waste food. Overall dining experience were good.
4
Food quality is good.
Set lunch price is reasonable.
Must try their truffle fried egg with shrimps.
However, seems lack of manpower.
3
food was ok but the restaurant was very open concept..
service was good and prices are also friendly..
5
kudos to the staff on duty, extremely friendly and great recommendations on food.
have been supporting xiyan for many years. food are consistently gd
5
Affordable and great tasting food served by Xi Yan Shaw in Orchard! Great serice provided in this restaurant too
5
Great promo for month of July, free portion of Xi Yan's signature niang tou foo for min 2 diners and $30 spent.
4
Had dinner here a few times and will go back again as the dishes are far from boring...Service is prompt & friendly tooEverytime-sure-to-order dishes are the XO Radish Cake, Cod fish rice noodle and the Hakka Lo Shi Fan.For drinks the Kamquat Honey (hot/cold) is so tasty & refreshin
3
Service staff were very attentive and efficient. The service stood out more for me than the food, the XO mee tai mak was tasty but a tad too dry. Loved their mapo fried tofu, the butter salted egg yolk squid we found the rings too thick and big, also the batter was too soggy with the butter. Might go back and try other dishes
5
Second time dining there and the quality of the food is consistently good. I love the fish soup with rice. Great ice cream too. I enjoyed both the lychee ice cream with osmanthus flowers sprinkled on top as well as the gula melaka ice cream with glutinous rice
3
I revisited the placed after 1 year ago. I ordered bitter gourd, fish with pomelo sauce, fried vermicelli, fried rice and pork rib with vinegar. The bitter gourd tasted half cook; fish coated with thick flour & the sauce was sweet & sour rather than refreshing; lastly, the pork rib was hard and I am pretty sure it was frozen pork that was not cut properly. I can tell why there were not many patrons on Sat lunch. Quite a disappointment
4
It's always a joy to dine at Xi Yan - be it lunch or dinner. Service is good, servers are attentive and easy-going and friendly. Many dishes on menu are akin to home-cooked food. Best part is prices are not damaging to your wallet. My friends and I definitely will make a return visit to this place
4
Good place for value for money and homecooked food. Worth a visit. They also catered to 1 portion order so if you are alone, you can still dine there
5
I have been to Xi Yan at Duxton but this one at Shaw Center is pretty good too. The food comes with some surprises in terms of taste - creativity.
3
Food tastes fine, nothing special. We remember taste was better a few years ago when this outlet just started. Service is passable. Overall, just average.
3
The style of cooking at this restaurant is rather homey. Some of the dishes are quite local. The service is friendly.
4
impeccable service staffs. food was good if only if it was less salty. every dish we ordered was a tad too salty.
4
Chefs do a wonderful job of ensuring the right balance of taste and texture. I have never been disappointed in my visits.,Do make reservations especially for weekends.
3
We were quite taken aback considering the fave reviews. Except for the service it was very 'foodcourt' dining of local fare...
5
All the staffs are friendly & handle queries very well. Been there a few times & the food never fail me. But would like to call out that for the Hong Kong steam fish, the taste is good but the fish texture is a bit mushy. But overall it's still an enjoyable meal with good service & food
4
The restaurant was relatively quite for Monday night with about a couple tables occupied. Service was fast.Pork Patty with Salted Fish and Water Chestnut ($6++/ petite)The patties looked simple and a tab dry but it was savoury and crunchy inside.Salivating Spicy Chicken ($6.50++/ petite)It looked quite spicy with the layer of chilli oil on top. There was cold silky smooth potato noodles buried underneath the pile of chicken slices and century egg wedges. While it was spicy, it was refreshing cold at the same time.Deep-fried Shrimp Paste Fish Fillet with Pomelo Water Chestnut Salad ($9++/ petite)It looked different from the picture. An odd combination which worked refreshing well. It was a party in the mouth with savoury shrimp paste, juicy tart pomelo and sweet dressing.Fried Lo Shi Fan with Xi Yan XO Sauce ($12.80++)Simply looking with wok taste and crunchy feel. Thought that it would be spicy with XO sauce but turned out that it was not
3
We went there a couple of years back and the food was very good. Decided to go back there for lunch as we were there to watch a movie. We ordered the truffle fried rice (no truffle taste at all, it was very blend), the fried pork belly (really no meat at all, all fats), the fried lo shi fan (blend and oily). I like the menu, some of the food you don't see often at other restaurants but quality of food was quite a disappointment.
4
Morden Chinese resturant centrally located.
We enjoyed the yummy food and the food portion is just right. Will defintely go back again.
5
We had a wonderful meal at Xi Yan Shaw. The menu selection and food portion is good. Will definitely go back again.
5
First time patronise 喜宴 @ Shaw. Service standard remain fine dinning standard.
Dishes are awesome and so yummy.
4
I thoroughly enjoyed my dinner at Xi Yan Shaw. I have been there a couple of times but never once was I disappointed with their food and service. My favourite dishes are carrot cake and their fried rice.
5
Good food and good service
Nice ambience and centralised location.interesting signature dishes and highly recommended
3
Tucked away in Shaw, a nice and quiet place to dine.Personal favourite : rice in superior fish soupPrefer the fried lo shi fan with Xi Yan XO sauce over the hakka style, though both was equally peppery.The Kailan with Crispy olive leaves and garlic was ok excpet the olive leaves wasn't crispy at all.The Okinanawa black sugar zhenjiang spare ribs wasn't quite what I had expected. It was a little sourish though it was supposed to be sugared.Leg of pork with chinese vinegar, ginger and garlic was not sourish and tender enough for me
4
Decided to check out this place after scouting around for lunch. We ordered Yong tau foo noodles, butter gourd with minced meat and olive leaves, fried tofu with spicy meat sauce, vinegar pig trotters and fried carrot cake. Everything turned out delicious except for the fried carrot cake. We especially liked the bitter gourd dish as well as the vinegar pork trotters that was executed to perfection! Will be back to try more dishes
4
Liked the food here and service was prompt. They had interesting and innovative dishes not typically found at the usual found at the typical Chinese restaurants.Dishes I liked: black truffle prawns omelette, salted yolk pork ribs, steamed cod, & deep fried pork belly in fermented bean curd sauce,
3
Made prior reservation and brought 2 friends to try this restaurant. Its not my first time, perhaps my third. The good thing is that the restaurant and menu is small so you can decide your order pretty quick and the get your food quick too. My friends like the dishes we ordered; salted egg yolk sotong, deep fried pork slices, rice porridge and toufu with olive veg. I didn't like that the food comes to your table warm and not hot. Surprised since the kitchen can't be that far unless it's been sitting in the kitchen waiting to be brought to the table.The other improvement is the table reservation, twice including this recent visit, we were almost half way through our meal when they called to check if we were coming to the restaurant. This is despite us telling them when HAD a reservation when we arrive. And the caller sounded rude and can't wait to tell you they want to cancel your booking
5
Searched prior to leaving Perth, found Xi Yan Shaw Casual had a Prosperity Dinner set menu for two persons, with an online booking option.Came here for the prosperity dinner Sunday evening, 6th Feb, with my local friend - we enjoyed menu set C - each course was introduced by the server - my friend also explained the significance of each ingredient - it made the celebration of the food with good company much more interesting.On top of the excellent meal I must also compliment the restaurant staff for their excellent service.Prior to arrival I rang to confirm that our booking was ok...the lady on the phone rang back to confirm all ok which was really appreciated.When I arrived at the Shaw Centre, near the Lido Theatres and the Polo outlet, I became lost trying to locate the Xi Yan Shaw Casual restaurant, I rang, speaking to a gentleman who offered to come down and return to the restaurant - all good.What happened is that I should have gone to the Claymorehill Rd entrance, from there it was upto L3....very easy.Thanks again for a great meal and top customer service at all levels.We will come back again
5
Must tries are the salted egg yolk prawns and the truffle omelette and the ruffle fried rice. Other dishes are really yummy and we love that the food is always service hot and promptly.
4
The food was delicious, unique and service rendered was reasonable. The chef is able to tweak some of the traditional dishes with new and innovative flavours to tickle the palate. The only setback was the place was a tad too cramped.
5
Xi Yan never fails for a casual family dinner, reasonably priced and delicious Chinese food. Particularly love the chestnut pork leg beehoon they have as a monthly special, pls keep it on the menu!
5
So glad to have xi yan in Sg. I love their branch in taikooshing hkg and have tried their outlet in Craig Rd but this branch in Shaw mirrors very closely to the one in hkg. Can't wait to come back here again.
4
A no-frills modern Chinese restaurant that gives a contemporary update to otherwise traditional dishes. Do not expect private dining areas in this small establishment but it has a nice ambience with cheerful artworks adorning its walls. Food is reasonably priced and service staff are very helpful. It can get a little too cramped for comfort when full and reservations are highly recommended during festive periods
4
Love the YuSheng which was surprisingly good with salad leaves and plum sauce. The prawns came with pineapples and apple slices goes v well. Did not like the marinated pork belly. The pepper chicken pieces came mostly in breast meat. I expected it to be tough and coarse but it turned out quite well. The ginger soup (dessert) was a trifle hot but the sesame dumplings was delicious! I must not forget about the staff who was cheerful and enthusiastic despite a busy evening.
5
It was my first visit to Xi Yan and I wonder why I didn't discover this restaurant earlier! The Yu Sheng was not your typical ingredients but tasted good. Dishes are also not commonly found outside but we enjoyed all of them. Restaurant also served very smooth tang yuan (glutinous rice balls). Yums yums - am planning to go back again real soon!
3
Location good, However cant fit in big group, max can only 8pack. Rerservation is fast and fast using Chope
4
Try the set lunch. The servings for the rice/noodles mains were big. If you are a small eater then share the set and order some meats from the a la carte menu. We tried the salivating chicken appetiser which was an interesting blend of flavours - spicy and tangy.Interesting desserts which included pumpkin salted egg yolk ice cream
5
Lucky to have lunch with 4 good colleges and friends. Shared the prawn, 3egg vegetable soup, pork, and gourmet ice cream deserts. For sub $17 plus plus sets the quality was amazing. Will definitely be back. The only Con is that the restaurant was too small to have a bigger Dept dinner. Will definitely bring my family to tr
4
Went for early Sunday lunch at Xi Yang, Shaw. Comfortable, relaxing small eatery with good food and service.
4
Had dinner with a gf, the service staffs were pleasant and attentive. Food quality was good, but I find the price is a bit expensive.
4
Dishes are delicious and well presented. The tofu dishes were yummy and the sauces were not too salty. Special mention must be made for the cod fish with rice noodle which was my favorite. Worth a try!
5
I have chanced upon this restaurant through a Friend and am so Glad that it was recommended. Loved the oriental vibe to the place with their decorations and setting. Even though it was dinner time, it wasn't noisy but just comfortable. Service was prompt and food was really unique. We ordered small size portions and the quality of food is exceptional - a perfect balance of spices on your taste bud. I will return for more. Reviewed in a group of 5. Dinner setting.
4
Discovered this by accident and turned out to be a great new addition (to my own list) of favorite Chinese restaurants in Singapore. The lunch sets are quite reasonably priced though I can imagine the a la carte menu could be expensive. Good food and service. I will be going back
4
They serve simple but yet tasty dishes. Quite surprised to find Hakka abacus beads in the special menu on my visit. It was very delicious. I loved the dan-dan noodle. It was different from the usual Sichuan style. This has a nutty and sesame taste which I liked very much. Even the lemon grass drink is solid.Very satisfied meal
5
Tucked in a quiet corner of a quiet mall, it is hard to get foot traffic. Thus Xi Yan has to rely on regulars that are drawn there solely by the taste of the food. Instead of the usual fare that you'll find in a regular Cantonese or Teochew restaurant, Xi Yan experiments with unique dishes that are simple and yet appealing to the tastebuds. I'll recommend a visit.
3
We came here for lunch on sunday, we have ordered golden tofu with fried olive leaves in mapo sauce, xo carrot cake, di huang miao and black truffle yunnan ham fried rice. All the dishes were delicious and tasty. We wanted to ordered desserts but we were too full. Nice
3
I came here because I've heard good reviews of this restaurant. Everything on the menu sounded delicious so we decided to order the recommended /signature dishes. To be honest, the soy duck was a total let down. The slices were cut a bit too thick and it was quite tough when it was served. There were nothing special about the spinach egg dish. However, the niang dou fu is one of the best I've had as the filling inside were amazingly soft and full of flavour. The ratio of filling to vegetable was just perfect. The steamed fish is also good paired when this sour-ish black bean sauce with rice noodles. Sounds like an odd combination at first but boy does it goes well together. It's quite a casual place to have lunch with very reasonable prices. Next time maybe I will try their truffle fried ric
5
This is the place where I bring my girlfriend to for dinner when she's unhappy, to cheer her up.It works everytime mainly cuz of the 2 amazing dishes stated above and I'll repeat it here again for the fun of it:A) Prawn Paste Fishb) Magic PorridgeJust a disclaimer: The above are the names I adopted cuz usually I just tell the waitress, Susan, and she knows. Or I point at the pic - the menu is so well designed. Can't get it wrong.Can you imagine..... i mean... everyone who's a foodie, knows prawn paste chicken. I mean Har Cheong Gai. But prawn paste FISH?? No where else can u get this... simply amazing.It's hard to discribe cuz writing this brings a tear to my eye... yes... it comes with a tangy and refreshing orange lemony sauce ala western fushion style... topped with Pomelo fruit pulp. Frankly, I can't even begin to wonder how they get delicious fresh pomelos the whole year round....Essentially, after trying this dish, should be enough to make it to my final meal menu.Now the porridge.... it's a simple dish with simple ingredients... rice and fish in a brownish soup.But 1 spoonful of it... and it warms your soul from within... simply out of this world. I mean... no porridge... not even the lobster porridges in the big restaurants that I've eaten, comes close to this in flavor, class and succinct simplicity amidst complex flavors and textures. This dish is in a class of it's own.Frankly, the other dishes, to me, are fine. The new dan dan noodles are a refreshing addition to the menu. Special mention to the glutinous rice balls. Both the flavors are ravishingly good.I was there for Easter night dinner asking for a table for 8 pax. Had to wait a while but the competent staff didn't disappoint. As we were regulars, Susan greeted us, chatted with us for a while, and took our orders as her colleagues cleared the table with exiting customers.Within 5 mins, we were seated at our table with our drinks and menu, ready to order.Overall, it was a splendid evening. Would be back with friends again, definitely.Must Tries:Magic Porridge, Prawn Paste Fis
5
Very impressed with the taste and presentation of the foods we ordered. We truly enjoyed our lunch. The yusheng is unique and appetising, very different from other restaurant.
4
Innovative cooking, or classical dishes with a twist - the food is surprisingly good and creative for such a small restaurant. Now that they have settled in, service is also much better - friendly and knowledgeable. Good value too.
5
Lovely smoked egg with truffle & salmon roe to celebrate Easter. The dish i love most is their porridge which is extremely tasty & it warms my heart, calms my day. You definitely have to try it yourself! Recently they included vinegar pig trotters in their menu! Sweet & sour.. Very appetizing indeed! Look forward to more mouth watering & creative dishes in Xi Yan in the near future.
5
Had a delightful dinner at this exceptional restaurant a few times. Tucked away in Shaw Centre, it is not exactly easy to find this little gem. Nevertheless the food is really great, just look at the menu! Love the ribs, the toufu and noodles. The price is very reasonable and most importantly the service staff are spontaneous and great in their service. Highly recommended and make sure you do a booking!
5
Quality and innovative cuisine at an affordable price. Recommended for those who are a bit tired of the local dining scene, and would like to try a different take on local favorites without breaking the bank. Unlike the flagship private dining venue in Tanjong Pagar, this outlet is targeted at the middle-market in Singapore, and a welcome addition it is
1
Let me start by saying that I love Xi Yan private dining so I was quite pleased to hear that it started the Shaw Center unit that does not require reservation ahead and cater to small group. I was extremely disappointed.Firstly, the good : the dishes' taste composition was good, following the same style of the private kitchen though less elaborated. But it is still good.Secondly, the dishes' presentation is bad. They look NOTHING like what is shown on the menu. The restaurant was not even pack on the evening we were there, yet the kitchen seemed too much in a hurry to slam food from wok to plate. Anyone would have been more gentle even when you plate dish in your own home kitchen.Thirdly, the service is FAR BELOW acceptable level. Let me recount the following:(1) We were the first at the restaurant and not knowing that we were to tick on the order DIY, we asked for the service staff to take order. They reminded us that we have to DIY, they are not SUPPOSED to do for us. And we have to cross check on the dish availability after handing in the order because some items were made unavailable during this CNY period. Not only is this not efficient, unwelcoming, rude but also not logical. We diligently filled up the form only to have the staff returned to us twice because two of the items were among those not available during CNY.(2) For whatever strange reason, the only male waiter does not serve lady. I was the only lady on the table of 4. After we had the Yu Sheng, he prompted took away the bowl plate chopsticks for the 3 men. Then he returned with 3 fresh sets for the 3 men. I waited but he never wanted to clear mine. I had to ask a lady waiter to change my set. It happened again at the end of the main dishes when he came to clear the paper napkins for the 3 men. Then he returned with 3 fresh napkins. I stopped him immediately and he look TOTALLY STUNNED when I asked him for the same. Is there a policy or reason or message that the restaurant is putting across to lady diner?(3) All the wait staff hand us the food plates from between diners. So they expect us to place the plates on the table, organize the table, pass the rice bowls to each diner. Unless someone has better explanation, I wish to tell the owner that this is totally not acceptable. I do not expect the same attention like the private dining but basic service by side of table. It is impossible that the restaurant hires all wait staff that do not have basic knowledge for serving. The poor service level basically destroy what was supposed to be a good dinner

Location- At shaw centre on the 3rd level. Nearest train station is Orchard.Food - I must state that I didn't really read the menu carefully. We ordered 1 rice superior fish soup and 1 niang doufu noodles. The niang doufu noodles is quite okay. There were 3 pieces of niang doufu inside and the soup was heavier on the bitter gourd taste. Lol Then there wasn't any fish in my rice superior fish soup, they had ikan bilis and pieces of "you tiao". The soup was good but I guess it should had been subtly pointed out. We ordered a fried chicken wing which was described in the menu as marinated with cheese if I remember accurately. It was deep fried well.Service- Average service. Nothing much to holler about overall. One girl did explain which of the sides, will go well with our 2 mains after we asked.Price- I guess the price is reasonable for orchard road dining places which was the saving grace of the place. If its slightly more expensive, I would had rated it a 2 stars overall.Just remember to try the fried rice or other stuff like the other reviewers gush about rather than the rice in superior soup, which was featured in the newspaper, its okay but nothing to rave about as theres like nothing of substance inside
4
Xi Yan is located in Shaw Center on 3rd floor. The location is not so ideal near the corner. But a lot of people are eating at restaurant. The food is really delicious. We ordered bitter gourd with minced pork, bean sprout and marinated duck. The recipes are quite special and unique. The size is big even we order small plate.
4
A spin-off from their banquet style resturant, this outlet offers the same high quality tasty Chinese dishes but with mid-range prices, no-frills everyday dishes, fast service and down-to-earth ambience. Located on the third floor of Shaw Centre in the heart of Orchard Road shopping district. A wonderful choice before or after a movie in the same building or simply a meal break to rest your feet. The dishes are small and light, perfect for small group of 2 to 3, under $25 per head. The Pregnant Women's Fried Rice ($11,80++) is exceptionally great and could be shared between two persons when you order other dishes
5
There are no questions that there are many Chinese restaurants in Singapore. Xi Yan offers more healthy choices and also very good value for money. I liked their Tofu related theme as well as their noodle choices. Stafffs are friendly and it is very popular. The problem is they cannot take reservation since they are many walk-ins at Shaw Center.
