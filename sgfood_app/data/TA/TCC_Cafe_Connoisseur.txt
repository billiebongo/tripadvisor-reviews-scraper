We had dinner at this cafe and were very impressed with the range of food and presentation. Drinks were expensive but not at Singapore prices elsewhere where you pay a lot more. Staff helpful and friendly. Good ambience inside a small shopping area.

We came here for afternoon tea and were pleasantly surprised with the artistic looking desserts available. So we skipped the normal cakes and ordered one to share. Tasted really good too!

We had a lovely surprise dining at TCC Alexandra and for that matter, any TCC because of the membership birthday surprise! At 50 % off meals on the birthday month plus another 30% on another occasion. Amazing; as we were surprised when paying our bills. We had a sirloin steak, potato with corn, calamari, ham and cheese sandwich and seafood aglio olio. The seafood aglio olio was really good with large grilled shrimps and succulent scallops. I also liked the ham and cheese as it was served in a lightly toasted, buttered bread. And I love butter. The calamari and mushroom tartlets make good starters and I highly recommend them.

We went to the TCC at the SHAW centre right after watching a movie. We went for lunch on a Sunday. The wait to get a table was not long at all and there were a couple of empty tables. I got the GRILLED STRIPLOIN and it was very good,especially the carrot potato puree. Mom ordered the high tea and I didnt like that it all came in one plate but the flavor was fine, nothing marvelous. We also got and DONT recommend the assorted grilled chicken and seafood skewers, we did not like those at all. The mangostine tea we ordered was very good. The waitress we got was not nice, mainly because she looked angry and dissapointed the entire time (maybe she was having a bad day) but the rest of the service was also slow and they forgot to bring my water, I got it when I was finishing my food and because I reminded them.Its an okay place but I dont think I would recommend it

Have eaten at TCC many times at different outlets. However, this time encountered really bad service at this outlet. Staff was not attentive despite there were only handful tables of customers. Even when attempting to pay the bill, stood at the counter for some time and no staff in sight. Unable to grant us the member birthday discount even though it is the birthday month. Food is good as always, but service needs improvement

The branch at Ion was closed for renovations, so we went to the Lido branch. They were having a one-for-one lunch deal, so we opted for that.Service was quick, but the food was just okay. They were generous portions but lacked something tastewise and I did not really enjoy the meal

I had a great dinner at TCC VivoCity ! Sorry I can't find right outlet in TripAdvisor.We had a outdoor view n the service crew, a young Malay guy was attentive n friendly. The portion was big n yummy even it is on GSS 50% promotion. We love the lava cake, grapefruit Yuzu, scallop prawn pasta, cafe latte. Thank you.We had a great time ! :

Came here for solo lunch.Ordered a crayfish pasta and fried calamari.Always eaten calamari in a ring form, guess this was squid or maybe real calamari cut into chunks. Overall, find it unlike the usual calamari I used to eat.The crayfish pasta was not bad. Portion was big.Overall, good quality food though I find the price on the steep side for such quality and ambience

I normally do late coffee breaks on Fridays so I decided to try Tcc at Alexandra. The place is generally quiet if one prefers a relax atmosphere. I ordered a cheese cake, which was different with peanut butter base and the premium coffee. Coffee blend is smooth, medium bodied with low acidity. Service is acceptable but I would prefer the coffee served together with the cake. Overall, standard is above average

Whenever I am in Singapore, I always make sure that I drop by TCC. I just love the food and the coffee! I had lunch with my former boss last week at the branch in VIVO and they didn't have the food that I ordered so I switched to Wagyu and I'm not sorry. It was good and my former boss loved her scallop pasta (as always). Other that the gastronomic experience, customer service too is big for us and TCC never fails to deliver. We were served by Jeffrey Castillo (yes, we had to ask for his name because we wanted to commend him) who again reminded us of why we love TCC. Food is 10 stars, customer service is 11. Thank you Jeffrey
