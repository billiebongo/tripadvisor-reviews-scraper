Interesting cider, nice ambience though quite empty. Service confusing at times but well-meaning. Toilet needs reno.

Chose this place for my 1st date, paid for a 39 for a lobster spaghetti, and it was undercooked. Oh well, they only told me that they will inform the chef...but that's it...
I'm just glad that my date was not critical.

We recently went to Breton with friends and family and tried a large portion of the menu.  - The charcuterie was excellent, especially the pork terrine.  - The grilled lobster was outstanding and we tried all three types and they are all distinctly different, very well done.  - The grilled steak was also done to perfection. - We didn't sample any of the desserts as we were all too full, but they looked fantastic. - Also, a good selection of wines and as has been mentioned, ask for the 'special' wine list. We were sad to see the French Stall go, but chef Xavier and the team have outdone themselves and we will most definitely be back

Far from the madding crowd (but close to a MRT station), this little French restaurant offers authentic traditional French food, as well as excellent lobsters, at soft prices. Friendly service, good wine list, tender meats (I recommend the Onglet aux Ã©chalotes), yummy desserts from Brittany, what can you ask more

We used to patron French Stall a lot while we were staying at Kerrisdale. This is our first time back after it reshaped itself as Breton.Many of the old favorite French Stall dishes are still around such as chicken liver patte, onion soup, duck breast and rib-eye steak with garlic butter. The lobster dishes are a welcomed addition to the menu.We went as a group of 7 people and we ordered 3 appetizers, 3 onion soup, two ribs, 3 duck breast, one meat skewer plater and one lobster plus lots of French beer. I believe everybody enjoyed the meal thoroughly.If I have to say anything that could be done better, then I would probably say that the lobster (500g) is a bit small and the French beer is a bit over-priced

If you are looking for a French experience that is authentic without the trappings then this is the place for you. The owner chef is very accommodating. There are two wine lists and the better one has to be specifically asked for as waitresses show some hesitation finding it:) the food is usual French basic like steak frites and the desserts are very good. The seating is on a sidewalk, relatively quiet. The price quality ratio is good. Much to recommend.

Tucked away on Serangoon near the Tamil language school this gem has a clean, simple menu of Breton dishes served with charm and warmth. The Breton cider is good and there's a nice, reasonably priced wine menu and a happy hour.  We had ribeye steak. Perfectly prepared. Dauphinois potatoes floating in rich butter. A nice country pate and a dessert meringue. I had a lobster pasta that had a lovely sauce though the lobster was slightly over cooked. It's open air with no air con so it could get a bit to warm if you came in early afternoon but the quality, reasonable prices and friendly staff over come that. Very much recommende

There was wine tasting that evening when we were there and we got to try 8 various wines for $22.80. There was a time frame given but they kindly extended it so that everyone could have a taste of all the wines. We ordered the steak & the potato gratin it came with was excellent! Love this place

Happy to dine there again. It is conducive for family chat over dinner, we enjoyed ourselves very much

Ordered 2 pastas, both were under seasoned. Especially the lobster pasta which was not worth the money.

Great place to have French food. Lobster, Beef, Spaghetti etc. Parking is a problem but is worth to solve the parking problem. As the foods are worth it! Happy hours 3pm to 7pm, 20% off all beverages!

We love Breton for lots of reasons, authentic French food at very reasonable prices. Wine menu is good with quality house wines at a price point I rarely see in Singapore. Our kids LOVE their food, this is one of their favourite restaurants. We LOVE the menu and the food quality. Highly recommend a visit

Liked the homely, casual feel of the Breton. Staff were attentive and the food portions were substantial and of food quality. We enjoyed the starter that came with an assortment of pate, cheese ham. The main courses were also very well cooked. Definitely a good place to bring friends and family to

The old lady who waited us has no basic knowledge on how to serve a meal and when to collect the plates after meal. The dinner table is too small for solo and worse for couple to share. Food relative to the price charged I would rate average

Two of us enjoyed a platter of pate, charcuterie and rillette, lobster and an Andouille salad. For dessert, we had a stellar chocolate soufflÃ© and apple croustillant. The wine selection was very good and they even carried a beautiful prune eau de vie digestif. A wonderful spot for dinner in a chill setting. The staff were attentive and obliging. We will definitely go back.

Breton is our local. We can walk there in ten minutes. We don't go often enough, because life is busy, but after each meal there, we are reminded what a wonderful place this is.Breton serves authentic French food in a unique, local setting - shop house, no aircon, because their customers and the chef like it that way. Places like this are disappearing, sadly. We love the sitting in an alleyway, feeling the breeze and looking at the stars. In the middle of a busy ever changing city, Breton has been a French outpost for 17 years!The food is outstanding. Chef Xavier's steak is as good as anything at a fancy steak restaurant. Everything he cooks is great! You might feel like trying his home made pate or his lobster galette. There is pizza and pasta or a decent cheese platter and a good selection of fairly priced wines. This is a family business - service is personable and committed. Breton is a place like no other and deserves your support
