I am a frequent visitor here. If you can find well done. You will be in for treat. Great cocktails, snacks and a nice place to chat worth people at the bar. You will not be disappointed.

Excellent flavorful ramen, romantic ambience, friendly service crew. Totally worth checking out. Try entering from Uma Uma via the secret door.

Great place to unwind after work with cocktails, ramen and appetisers. Definitely recommend the wagyu tongue ;-) The only thing is there isn;t enough lighting to read the menu... :-D
5
Cocktails are nice, service is good, cool and classy bar, with high prices to match. Several food items on the menu from the Japanese bar on top.
5
Great service, delicious cocktail, delish ramen and salmon bowl, pretty decor and lovely ambiance. Great music and not too loud - we could have a conversation. It's a nice hangout place!
5
Great bar, not too crowded. Foods are excellent, cocktails great and the junmai daiginjo sake (warm) just divine with dried stingray, tuna avocado and edamame.
5
Love this place. My favorite is the junmai daiginjo sake with stingray fin....best pairing to create umami, and tuna avocado with gyoza skin (also umami with the sake). The noodle soup are excellent, just rite, not salty. Ask for half bowl so you can try different bowl and taste. Service is also great here

Great place to hangout after work, check out this place after many friends recommendation. Well it at the corner part of basement, quite easy to spot. Not sure if 6pm considered early on Friday, it is pretty empty when we arrived. The crowd gradually starts to arrive after 9pm.Food wise we only ordered bites as we had a late lunch earlier. Bar bites honestly we are pretty disappointed, especially the stingray dish. It is overly cooked and we do not like the fishy smell. The server offered to replace this dish as they felt is it a little overcooked as well. Cocktail wise is pretty refreshing, pricing is pretty decent. I might revisit them someday to try out their Ramen which my friends have highly feedback to us

This place is not easy to find. We indeed hesitate before entering. However, itâ€™s stunning inside with the decor and the cozy vibe. Tried 4 different drinks + side dish and I will recommend the Sloe and Steady (gin base). Will definitely go back before crowd pour i

Atmosphere was impressive. Loved how cozy it is. Doesn't get too noisy so a good choice if you want to catch up with friends. Its quite dark in there so if you have night blindness maybe that's something to take note of. Service staff was very friendly. Loads of food options ran out although it was a Monday early evening, which was disappointing. However quality of food was good - uma ramen is definitely a safe choice. Drinks were great, enjoyed the cocktails. On the pricey side but for the quality of the food and the atmosphere, worth a try
4
Food was really good and authentic. The setting made us feel very relaxing. It was nice to chill with drinks and bites and catch up with friends. The beef cubes were awesome. We will be back for more!
4
it is located at one shopping mall basement. and together with a Japanese restaurant. the bar is at right hand. the snacks is special and delicious
5
Fantastic place, great drinks and good food. Would definitely come back again with friends or dates.
5
As always, this is a very nice place for drinks and chill with friends. Aircon is a bit cold though haha.. but ok
5
It gave me a great surprise. Its location is very hidden. Friendly staff, excellent drink beverage, and decent decoration and quiet environment ! It is super suitable for close-friends to talk each other heart to heart.

Nice atmosphere for a quiet chill bar.. service was good, very friendly mixologist (or common term - bartender). Love the variety of cocktails available..
If you have a preferred liquor, they are more than happy to give suggestion of cocktails options out of the menu.
2
The service was good and the sake too. In general the food was fine, but when 2 out of 3 person end up with food poisining it is not fine.
4
As per the title says, good drinks. No issues with reservation for singapore cocktail fest. Good ambience
4
I'm new to the bar scene, but Horse's Mouth is quickly becoming a favourite. They were nice enough to reserve bar seats for my party after just a gentle request online. This was my second time here, and my bartender from the previous time, Axl, made it a point to say hello and introduce himself to my friends. We got a couple bespoke drinks each, and were very happy with the innovation and skill our mixologists showed. We left happy, satisfied, and perhaps just a little more educated about alcohol. :
5
Great for late night food on the weekends, and ramen at all other times. The food is good but that's not the draw. Enter through a hidden tapestry at the ramen shop upstairs and descend the staircase to a hidden gem of a speakeasy bar that will make you feel like you've traveled back to the golden age of cocktails. Kenneth, Jermaine, and crew kept our glasses full and our spirits uplifted on a business trip that stretched into weeks
5
Highly recommend Mazesoba ramen and Kopi Kaya cocktail! Excellent service as well, and fantastic ambience.
4
Excellent service. The drinks are slightly pricey, but value for money. I like how friendly the bartenders are, and you get comfortable with them after a while.
4
One of the best places in town for creative cocktails, Japanese bar food and authentic Hakata ramen in a cosy ambience. Its entrance is a little hard to locate but well worth the hunt.
2
Nice concept and ambience as a hidden 'bar' but wagyu beef don was a letdown. Overcooked and not tasty.
Missable.
4
Tasted kopi kaya cocktail which was brilliantly executed. Warm kaya coconut foam on top of cold vodka kopi. Best ever cocktail to round up 2016. Brussel sprouts was spot on too.. great ambience, perfect for chillax..
5
Went for drinks and had amazingly well mixed cocktails (at $$$).
Cool staff and excellent venue. Happening place and well worth a visit.
3
The Wagyu beef don was amazing. The marination and tenderness of the beef was on point. Mocktails are also good although they are a little pricey
4
Located at Forum shopping mall, next to Hilton Hotel, orchard area. To go to this bar, you must go in from Uma uma restaurant and go to the door behind the curtain... It was so interesting! Nothing bad about the venue, the music is calm n good place to have a good chat with friends!They have good selection of Ramen, love the dry one with peanut sauce and minced pork, also the regular one (slightly spicy!).Cocktails there are also really interesting.. I tried the gin with fresh cherry tomato and bloody mary! It was ok, but a bit pricey.. And they also have good selection of Japanese whiskey! In general, i like this bar, and defo will come again
4
This is a semi-hidden bar in the heart of Orchard Road. They serve Japanese bar food and ramen which are incredibly value for money. They're supposed to be good with their cocktails but I have sake here so I can't comment on the cocktails other than they look interesting.Must try
5
Love the decor of this place, and so far whatever I've tried on the menu is tasty. Previous 2 times, sat at the normal tables, but had the luxury of bar seats this time round, chatted with the bar manager and even managed to try 2 off the menu cocktails. The stingray fins are also a tasty snack that we couldn't stop chewing on, would recommend the mentaiko ramen as well.Will definitely be back :
4
I love the decoration of the place. The place is also quiet and nice for us to have quality chat with each other.
5
Really enjoyed our night here. The place is extremely unassuming yet very chic with a great feel of Japanese. The cocktails are sensational with a great list and the staff are super welcoming and helpful. Would definitely recommend this place.
3
Warm and friendly staff with modern Japanese theme. Average food (except its signature Ramen). Very expensive cocktails which didn justifies it's price. ++ for special drinks made... Burnt SGD 374.74 for some food and 10 drinks for just 2 of us.
3
It was a dinner with couple of friends. I love the ambience but the cocktails were so so. Nothing fantastic. And the food was also nothing fantastic. Could be better. What a waste of a nice place.
5
Really happy we came and sat at the bar. Had a pleasant chat with the staff. Drinks and food were excellent.
5
Great food great cocktails great service! Will definitely return for more wonderful drinks very very soon!
4
We loved the cocktails that the bartenders whipped up. Slightly pricey but worth every drop. The food from the affiliated ramen shop was so-so though.
1
We didn't really know it was more about the cocktails in this place.So we entered thinking we would have a nice relaxing bit to eat in a classical looking setting. There was only one other table with guests when we entered.However the music was blazing loud. The waitress we had was intense almost as if she was on some stimulants or at least on 20 cups of coffees :).The noodle soups we had were quite though so no complaints there. We did not have any cocktails so can't comment on those.We were happy to leave just because the ambiance was not to our liking.Maybe for a young crowd who like blazing music and alcohol, this would be a great place.Love the logo screen with the horses/raccoons drinking away though
4
Nice server who recommends and customizes drinks for customers. But quite disappointing when we found out after our visit that the same food from Uma ramen costed a lot more when ordered from Horse's mouth. Felt like a ripoff, the exact same food from upstairs costed more when it was just brought down..
5
This is the only place I know where I can have proper dinner, which is an awesome bowl of Ramen while my thirsty friends have their cocktails made in front of them. The service is very warm and unpretentious, unlike most bars these days. Great place to be on Friday and Saturday nights! They do really amazing customized cocktails if nothing in the menu catches your fancy!
5
Good selection of Japanese whisky and exclusive setting. Can order and have your Japanese ramen (from affiliated ramen restaurant upstairs) in the bar. Special mention to a star staff, Janice, who is professional and very attentive to our orders.
4
Nice bar and deco but very slow service. One barman for bar full of people. 20min wait for G&T......;
4
Good drinks and food for a Christmas evening! Nice ambience.. Couldn't ask for a better place to head to!

Ok.... Cocktail are good of course, team is also smiling but the place is not very nice....no view, no cosy place to seat, no great music... So so place
5
Horse's Mouth was great. From the staff, to the drinks and the food, my fiance and I enjoyed it thoroughly. The bar tenders were very friendly, not to mention knowledgeable about the various components of the cocktails. We sat at the bar and loved watching them make the cocktails. Definitely going back again
5
I went here as a solo traveler and had a great time. The bartenders tiok really good care of me making great recommendations and mixing wonderful cocktails. The fiid is fine and the atmosphere is great. Depending on how you enter the place there is some mystery around it. Fun
5
Located just below the Uma Uma Ramen place and steps from our hotel on Orchard Road, the Horse's Mouth is a combination of great food and cocktails. My husband frequently goes to Singapore on business and always makes time to stop in to have a spicy ramen bowl and a great cocktail. We were recently in Singapore on vacation and we just had to stop by...he had his spicy ramen and I had the garlic ramen bowl which was fantastic. We also asked for special drinks from the "Mixologist" and were not disappointed. They also have sushi Tuesdays

I was looking for something "different" in the Orchard area and came across this place. The novelty of the "speakeasy" hidden below a Ramen joint added to the fun, and the promise of craft beverages didn't disappoint. Our bartender was quite social and very knowledgeable about the various spirits he was serving, as well as the history behind the concepts he was using. Certainly fun talking with him throughout the night. The cocktails were flavorful and unique. Be prepared for the expected Singapore pricing, with the cocktails coming it at $25SGD each.To access the bar, you must find the hidden sliding door behind a curtain within the ramen joint. Then carefully walk down a dark staircase into the basement, which opens up into a sizable bar. There are tables off to one side of the room, and also plenty of seats around the bar itself. If you are there for the drinks it is certainly more fun to sit at the bar and interact with the bartenders as they whip up their concoctions. The room is quite dark, but the ambiance is good.Ordered the tonkatsu ramen from their menu. It was ok, but nothing mind blowing. Certainly not cheap at around $20SGD

A friend and I went yesterday evening, having made a reservation to sit at the bar. We were not disappointed with the great atmosphere and service however the place is an absolute rip-off so we would not be returning. The cocktails at SGD$25 each is becoming more common place in Singapore, but the big issue is the food portions, we ordered the Wagyu beef, which consisted of a few cubes at $26, the sashimi, which was six of the tiniest pieces (half size of usual sashimi slices) they were a little more generous with the scallops, but all in all an absolute rip off. Total bill for two cocktails and two glasses of NZ wine, with 4 bar snacks was SGD$250, which is exorbitant even for this expensive city... we won't be back, which is a shame, if only the owners were less cheap and stingy and provided half decent portions it would be worthwhile
2
Cool secretive entrances into the restaurants and the service crew was great. They know their food and drinks well. Unfortunately, the prices for snacks are a complete rip off! 26$ for a measly dozen ( or maybe less) tiny cubes of wagyu beef. Stingray was cut up into relatively large pieces for something so chewy. It was a jaw workout. I don't even know what texture or taste the chef is aiming for.I do not recommend eating there at all. Just go for the drinks
