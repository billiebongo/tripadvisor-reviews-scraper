Went for group celebration for CNY recently, food offered is good quality, not too many choices so it's easy to decide what to eat. Recommend the Laksa, Chinese soup, Roast beef & Lamb.

Overall quite reasonable as it’s a one for one Buffett.
Food is ok and quite a variety.
Fast replenished of foods.
Considering it’s a one for one, so don’t e pact too much.
Good service and friendly staff.
Quiet place

Good choices for the buffet breakfast both Asian and Western. Staff were very helpful. Nice egg station

From Mon to Thu, their dinner buffet 1 for 1 goes for $59.80++ while weekend is $69.80++. Their oysters and prawns are really fresh and so is their salmon sashimi. Free flow of drinks and beer too. Not a bad deal overall.

Great breakfast buffet w/ fruit & salad, asian, western and Japanese dishes. A la cart was not as good. 6am to 10:30am on the buffet hours.

We went for the 1+1 Dinner. For a family of 8 adults and 1 child, it came to $390. There is free flow of beer and oysters. The sashimi and tuna is cut and served.The service staff are very friendly. Ok. Maybe not the person serving the oysters. But he is effecient and prompt. The cooked food section, some of the fried stuff was a little soggy. Didnt taste too delicious. If your family doesnt drink beer, then maybe its not as worthwhile. 11 yrs old is considered adult. My brother and sister in law have been here 5 times. Just to give perspective that its a very good lunch venue and tea for getting together to colleagues. Ambience is important for me in a buffet, so I prefer other choices

Fern Tree Cafe is offering one-for-one International Buffet promotion everyday, inclusive of Sundays and Public Holidays. The restaurant even offer free flow of beer and oyster during dinner. In addition, Other than lunch or dinner, one can also enjoy one-for-one High-Tea buffet where local and Asian delights like Nyonya laksa, Kueh Pie Tee, Pangat durian, Penang Char Kway Teow, etc are being served

The only request we have was to get an extra chair to put our large bags (because their tables and chairs are like what you see in a hawker centre, small chairs and plain square tables with no space to put your bags except on the dirty floor). However the male philliphine MANAGER, refused to give us an extra chair claiming that they will need the extra chair for their customers. After 20 minutes, the restaurant was still ONLY HALF-FILLED with at least 10 empty chairs!! Still he refused, such lousy service for god knows what reason? Besides the lousy service, the oysters were strictly restricted to 2 pieces/pax and if you want more, you would have to keep going back to queue for it. Oysters had some sand in it though. Food was average, nothing special to shout about. There is matcha latte available which is not common in usual buffets but the matcha latte tasted weird and powdery. Not cheap for the service and quality, expected more but came to be disappointed. Wouldn't be back

In my opinion, the cafe buffet is pretty good. The staffs are efficient and helpful. In June 17, I went for the weekend international buffet. With this, I would like to suggest or hopefully that the main dishes are rotated every month or twice monthly. Previously there were Roasted Duck, Roasted Beef, Satay, Hokkien mee, Crispy Pork, whole Baked Salmon Fish and others. With this feedback, I trust that the Cafe Chef and management would introduce some of those dishes again. I have been to the buffet for the past 15 years. I hope that the cafe will flourish for many years into the future

I was with my colleagues there yesterday to celebrate Christmas and New Year gift exchange. We had made a reservation for 16pax for both wednesday and thursday to celebrate. However, we realised we were given 2 separate tables side by side. We requested if there is possibility that we could move the round tables near to each other and sit around it from one of the waitress named Mandy but her reply was "NO. We CANNOT do that" with an irritated face. We were shocked as we ourselves are hoteliers and it seems that the staffs there are not trained enough to tactfully answer guests accordingly. We then tried to ask another staff dressed in black suit maybe the female supervisor, but her reply was even more rude. She said "No. If we can we would have already given to u. Its our policy and our restaurant is quite small so we CANNOT give u a long table". She behaved as if we asked multiple times when in fact we were asking her for the first time after checking with Mandy. It totally ruined the mood for the evening as Mandy served us as if she was forced to do so after our request for the table. Such a dissapointment. We will never come back again for sure for such a low standard service. Maybe they should really look into training their staffs better. Its the basic guideline that you are not supposed to say NO to your guest but instead make them understand the situation and offer alternatives to the guest. None of it was there yesterday. Dissappointed

The family enjoyed the choice and quality of the luchtime buffet which we had when we were there recently
4
A wide spread of international cuisine with very reasonably priced bill. Staff is courteous and helpful. Need improvement in atleast having 2-3 dishes in veg meal.
4
Went for breakfast and buffet has alot of choices, western & asian. Downside is alot of food was cold. Overall still a good place to eat for breakfast if there's nothing else.

I was with a 15-pax group for buffet lunch on Saturday 22 October and the food and service were pleasantly very good. Especially Pastry Chef Samantha who came to chat with us and recommended her cakes. The rest of the dishes were also carefully thought out by Executive Chef and executed well; it was very good all-around the table and we loved dishes like the risotto, the prawn paste steamed chicken (a first for many) and the pork with apples. Highly recommended

Had dinner with offer 1 for 1 at $68 ++ A good spread of sea food ,local dishes plus freshly cut sashimi and freshly shucked oysters . Free flow of Korean beer plus a good variety of hot and soft drinks Though it's a buffet but the service staff were excellent . Food quality deserved a thumb's up .Definitely value for money with this 1 for 1 offer

My wife and I had the buffet here thus week, our first time for 18 months. One for one with free flow beer, massive oysters and sashimi it's really good value. Additionally there's also plenty of Asain rushes on offer and thother seafood also.The quality is generally good, there's a couple of items that are questionable from a freshness perspective, is not replenished frequently or perhaps dome of the seafood frozen, but here's enough variety to tuck into the other items if that's your preference

I came here with my sister for the international lunch buffet and it didn't disappoint. There's quite a bit of variety on the food choices and i particularly like the Salmon and Tuna Sashimi-SO fresh! The lighting is bright and the restaurant has an open feel even though it's a part of the Miramar Hotel. The staff were so quick in attending customers' need and requests. Overall, a good experience and worth every penny

Walking into Fern Tree Café makes you feel transported to the 1980s with the interior and furniture, but it has a homey feel to it. I was there for dinner over the Easter weekend as they have a 1-for-1 promotion. They offered seafood such as oysters, prawns and mussels, with a good spread of mains and desserts. Plus there was free flow of Max beer. Overall it was worth the money but without the 1-for-1, I probably wouldn’t be there

Initially wanted to eat a buffet at another hotel/restaurant but manage to know this 1-for-1 offer given by the restaurant. It is also valid on eve of public holiday (Good Friday). Hence, we reserved and had our buffet.The spread of the buffet was quite good. There are cold cooked seafood as well as sashimi. However, we are not a fan of this cuisine. People who like them would not want to miss it. Other than these, the rest of the food suit our taste buds.In total, we paid slightly more than $40 for a 2 persons buffet

Had our reunion dinner with my family. The variety of food was adequate, despite the free flow of beer, and oysters. The quality of the oysters and salmons are inconsistent, some were okay, some were good, a few were great. Food quality is decent, nothing fanciful. I feel that the plates and glasses were not cleaned properly as I found some of them had stains on them. Despite the average food, I think the service of the staff were great, they greet you with smiles and made us feel welcomed

First time try the buffet here.. the soup of the day is so salty..the fatt chey yu sheng totally cannot eat... disappointed..
5
Totally satisfied with the service provided by the staff. Food is excellent and the best part is that it is so reasonable!!
3
Worth to go if only got promotion. Not much variety of live seafood, mostly are asian cook food. Unless you are someone that love to drink as it offer free flow beer.
5
We ate there at breakfast and dinner and for both there was a very good selection. Both are buffet although there is an egg chef who makes a very nice omelette. For evening meal there also is a good selection with plenty of seafood.

Went for the lunch at new year day with my relatives.Service - I wanted to rate it average. However, even the plates are generally not cleared. The staff were busy setting up the empty tables rather than clearing our table. Perhaps in the hope that if the table collapses from the weight of the empty plates, we would leave. I noticed one young female staff trying to clear my side of the table though at times.Location- Only buses. No trains stations in the vicinity.Food- Average was like the other reviewers pointed out. I like the drinks station though where we self service any soft drink, coffee or tea. The food was replenish quite promptly during the earlier part of the lunch hour

Atmosphere - averageFood- above averageService - goodWent for dinner on the 31 Aug 2015. They served drinks, beer, ice-cream, cakes, sashimi, and some local food as well. On the varieties, it below average on the choice you can select. Plus: Oyster are excellent and fresh. Beer are good.Minus: Limited selection

Breakfast was included in our stay and also ate here one night. For all meals there is a choice of buffet or off the menu. For breakfast there was ample choice of both Asian and western food. The food was average. One coffee machine was broken but the other made good black coffee. Bread rolls seemed a little stale. There is limited dishes on the dinner menu but the chicken and beef dishes we had were tasty enough. Local beer is about $9 for a can

Agree with a couple of other reviewers, it's quite an average buffet by Singaporeans standards. Choice-wise, it seems to be somewhat limited, although it brands itself as an international buffet. We came here for lunch on a weekend, and although there was sashimi, there were no oysters. The cheese selection was also the most pitiful thing I've ever seen at a buffet.I'd only recommend it on a promotional rate
3
The international buffet lunch is set out nicely. Very nice sea delicacies. Drinks coffee, tea and soft drinks from the machine are included in the price. The coffee from the coffee machine lacks a bit of flavour. No light drinks available from the machine not even cola ligh

The cafÃ© is situated at the ground floor of Miramar Hotel. There is a spread of local and Japanese food. During weekend, the dinner offers fresh oyster and free flow of local draught beer. The handling of the oyster is interesting. The oyster is shelled in front of the guest and the whole oyster with shell is washed in a basin of salt water!!! Wonder if the management has ever considered both the taste and hygiene of this operation! The quality of seafood is poor; some of them are obvious left over from earlier sessions! Prices are low; but not relatively good as compared to the quality of food served! Service is acceptable. Average outlet

There was plenty of choice - Asian or European food - and they had a two for one buffet offer with free beer while we were there. The staff were great.
5
Wow - that pretty much sums it up. If you cannot find something at this buffet to your liking then you must not eat at all. There are so many choices.
4
Fantastic breakfast. We had the buffet breakfast and it caters for everyone. The Chef makes the perfect omelette how you like it and the staff are only too willing to help.
4
I only had breakfast and that was a decent variety. The only gripe was the egg station "chef". Needs a few lessons in speed and how to make a decent omelette
4
Excellent buffet menu but personally couldn't manage to do it justice so just opted for A-la-carte menu at Breakfast. Excellent omelettes/scrambled eggs and the freshly squeezed orange juice is a must. Service is excellent.

A discount for Singapore Airlines stopover travellers saved the day - chips with Salmon - not really thanks.
Some advice on menu options could lift the game

Went there over the weekend for their buffet lunch at Ferntree - it was a steal at SGD38 one-for-one. Brought along my friend so we only had to shell out less than SGD20 each. Variety of food is well worth the money, plus the staff is very accommodating and friendly

Was there just last Saturday for the buffet lunch as the Hotel Miramar is currently having one for one buffet promotion until end of October 2014. Doing some publicity for them...heee..I went with 3 other friends (All Local except for one Caucasian) and we concur that overall the buffet is one of the better ones in town. Majority are hits with a few misses like the cakes and kuehs. The food is fresh and even the grapes are juicy and seedless. They have a good spread such as sashimi, cold prawns, mussels, scallops, teppanyaki, and freshly prepared Hainanese chicken rice and many others such as lamb shank, beef and some other local delights. My friends love their mee siam. I didn't manage to try everything including the chocolate fondue though. The staff are friendly and it is quite a quiet place probably due to not that easily accessible. I took a cab from Chinatown as walking could take about 20 minutes or so from there. I would certainly go back there again for the buffet as we know most buffet are substandard but certainly not this one
3
Is very clean, with lots of staff, if from Europe may not be to your taste breakfast has cereals, fried rice noodles soup corn beef hash raw eggs sushi fish curry fruit just to give you an idea of the selection our breakfast was included in the rate but if not is expensive bowl of cereals $8 per person. Dinner is also expensive with a mixed selection more for Asain taste

Went for a buffet dinner with my customer today as we got to learn that there is free flow of beer. Started off with salad as usual and the first bite of the vege tasted ok but felt something sharp and moving in my mouth, tool it out using my fingers and shockingly, i see a bug and it's still alive. Called the captain to inform him about the encounter and all he did was to remove the bug and vege off my table, no apology, no explanation, no form of compensation.... Never had such an encounter in hotel buffet in Singapore. I'll be pursuing with authority to make sure this place meets the basic health standards before more guest gets into bug eating experience like me... Makes me feeling like puking till no
