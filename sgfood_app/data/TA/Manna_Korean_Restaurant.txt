I had the ginseng chicken and it was delicious. Do note that it comes with some salt which you are supposed to add into your soup to suit your own taste. The pancake was excellent and highly recommend it.

Ordered Pumpkin seafood, Bibimbap and Kyeram chim (steamed egg); all were delicious. Also loved the side dishes; especially the seaweeds and kimchi. Staff is friendly, and restaurant setting is casual and relax.

The Korean sides looked and tasted just right. I had Beef Gulgogi (marinated beef with vegetables and glass noodles) served in 1 stone plate and a dessert. Pleasing.

It's actually a very good restaurant with good food and value. Good decor , very clean and geat service. You can either cook your own food or ask them to bring it ready from the kitchen so you don't go back to work smelling barbecue.

This restaurant is bright, spacious and welcoming. Service is efficient and pleasant. We tried the samgyetang, sweet spicy chicken, pajeon. The sweet spicy chicken looks nicer that it tastes. The pajeon was really good - crispy and warm and simply delicious! Would come here again to try other food and to eat the pajeon again

They have one of the best kimchi soup in Singapore. It is closest to the kimchi soup I had in Korea. Although the price is a bit high as compared to other Korean restaurant, but it has the most authentic taste as what you can find in Korea. I will definitely recommend this to everyone

ManNa Korean Restaurant. Located at 101-109 Telok Ayer Street, Singapore. A casual dining ambience that whips up the finest Korean delights. Enjoy a unique spread of the freshest vegetables, seafood, chicken, and meats. You can either cook your own food or order of the menu, the food that we tried was simply the best. On the whole a must try for all Korean food lovers, It gave me another view point of having Korean dining in a sophisticatedly way. The Staff are very professional the service is excellent and very friendly and attentive. The food is beyond expectations. Overall, So Satisfied, We Couldn't Ask For More

Food was good and it's comparatively cheap compared to most Korean restaurant. Will definitely go back to try out more of its dishes.

It was a cold afternoon so I decided to have hot spicy Army Stew for lunch. There was a lot of ingredients in it and the right level of spiciness. I love that the stew has a bit of everything in it: noodle, rice cake, sausage, ham, cabbage, tofu, beansprouts. It also comes with the side dishes: kimchi, cucumber & anchovies and steamed rice. It would be nice if they serve tea

I m not fan of Korean food esp. overuse of sugar. I found most of the dishes we ordered a tad too sweet particularly the bulgogj beef, fried chicken and even the fish.Eating too much sugar laced food is bad for health.I don t mind anyone with a sweet tooth giving it a 4 or 5 stars but if you r diabetic the sweet Korean dishes is not for you
3
Clean and bright with plenty of self advertisement including underneath the ads on a huge flat screen playing non-stop Kpop. Kyaran Chim egg dish was the pick of the bunch.
4
The lunch set was extremely cheap for its portion. Service was excellent and the food is above average compared to Korean stalls in food courts.
3
there are so many better places to have korean food....Manna used to be great but now just average! Still crowded during lunch hour!
4
There were 8 of us there for dinner. Had been there before, but it had been awhile. But as always the food was great. The prices and service were great.

Went for lunch with a friend. We had the bibimbap - there were 2 options - one for 13.90 sgd and the other slightly cheaper. We went for one at 13.90 which is served in the hot stone pot. Taste was average. Quality of meat was average. Okay place for lunch but nothing special

We like to try food from different cultures, and while we had cooked Korean food at home we had yet to eat Korean in a restaurant. We were passing just as we started getting hungry for lunch and thought we'd give it a go. We appeared to be shown to a table by the owner herself and she was lovely. We had the beef set meal with egg, the chicken set meal, sweet rice juice, and pear juice. The food was fantastic and there was so much of it! We didn't realise there was fruit at the end and as we got up to pay one of the ladies serving spotted us and said "Sorry, you haven't had your melon" which was an expected bonus. The service throughout was fantastic despite the fact that chaos suddenly reigned after we sat down as the whole world seemed to come in for lunch. Despite being so busy it wasn't too loud or felt crowded

Enjoyed a good quality, good tasting Korean dinner here with friends. Usual boring interior that all formal and ordinary square, plain Korean restaurants have only this one had giant Samsung screens playing K Pop videos. Not a bad thing!Decent food and service. Nothing to rave about but fine for good Korean food

Food here is fresh, delicious and they are generous with the side dishes, korean malt tea is provide and you can choose cold or warm. There's set lunch available which is slightly cost saving.There's so many food I like here that it's become a weekly lunch place.Surprised to see so few review when this restaurant is mostly crowded during lunch.Probably the lunch crowd are just people whom worked in this area.I have yet to try the BBQ, but all the food I tried so far are all yummy... Located beside the exit of the Telok Ayer MRT station.

Came to Telok Ayer looking for some Korean BBQ and came across Manna Korean Restaurant. This place left us feeling very satisfied with our BBQ experience. We enjoyed it very much and would recommend others try. Services was quick and smooth. Replacing the grill frequently too

It was just next to Telok Ayer MRT station. We were looking for a Korean restaurant and this was the nearest. The food turned out decent with thumbs up given for the toppoki (Korean spicy rice cake) which came in a thick sauce. The kimchi cabbage was very spicy. End of meal, we were served a small bowl of ginger tea with crushed ice (refreshing) and sliced watermelons.Service was good but the restaurant was not crowded
3
The spring onion pancake was good. We were disappointed with the oxtail soup but the chicken ginseng soup received approval round the table. Everyone's favourite was the beef bulgoggi.
3
Food was average compared to other popular Korean restaurants in Spore. Limited supply - if you arrived after peak hours, some of the items in the menu are no longer available.
4
Awesome food, priced reasonably! Service is average which is normal during busy times especially lunch.

love the bbq beef..

We went there with my parents visiting from far away, and we were simply amazed! As my girlfriend and me just spent 10 days in Korea before, we must say that the Food is great and authentic. The staff was super helpful! We were planning on ordering a set meal, when she advices us against, gave us some tips, and made it also cheaper in the end. Super nice experience, totally underrated

My wife and I were walking around the club street area looking for a baby friendly place to eat and ran across Manna. We had been looking forward to having Korean BBQ for a while, so we went for it. In short, great experience, good food, nice variety, affordable and the service was great too. Place was a good size, and they accommodated us nicely. Staff were attentive and food was great too.We look forward to going there again with some friends

This is a good value Korean BBQ place, and super clean looking if you are a little unsure of some of the other Korean restaurants in the Telok Ayer neighborhood. We are complete newbies at this, so I ordered beef bulgogi, which was delicious and fun, and my husband got a hot stone pot thing, which he reported was a little low on flavor. They bring you lots of strange little dishes and teas and watermelon for dessert. We are not adventurous, so we didn't eat most of it, but it was nice to try. The waitress was very friendly and helpful, and I saw her cooking away with a smile, leaning over a family of 5. Most of all, the price is great - rare for Singapore. Not rare for Singapore, bring a sweater for the AC

Manna was introduced to us by our colleagues and it's always a good sign when there are many Koreans at a Korean restaurant. We have been going to Manna for a few years now and the standards have remained consistently good.There is a wide variety of dishes and the lunch set are always popular (and reasonably priced too). Lunch time during the weekdays are packed, so it's advisable either to go early (before 12.30pm) or go later (after 1.30pm). Service is quite fast hence the tables do turn around quite quickly- it also helps they do have many tables available. Reservations are not accepted for small groups, e.g. 2pax. The restaurant is also popular with Korean tourists who do arrive by the bus loads.The banchan/ side dishes are always good and change regularly and they do allow free refills as long as within reasonable limits ( depends on the number of diners). They also serve free cold Korean tea as standard, as well as a slice of watermelon as dessert.It's always one of our favorite choice for Korean in Raffles Place (definitely better than the Manna stall in Asia Square which is about 10 min walk away)

In the last month, I have been there twice for dinner. Once with friends and the other with family. The food was authentic and the ingredients were fresh. We had a few items. One of them was the BBQ meat, which you can ask them to prepare for you in the kitchen or you can ask them to do it in at the table. The bbq meat is tender and well marinated. We also like the kimchi hotpot, where the stock is flavourful. Some people may prefer the stock to be thicker but we like it the way it is where it is not too overpowering. Ingredients were also generous.A must try is the bibimbap, the best I have tried in Singapore. The steam egg is good too.In terms of the sides, we like the spring onion pancakes best

We decided to revisit Manna Korean Restaurant last week after being reminded of it on the Meat & Greed programme which featured its new outlet at Asia Square Tower Food Garden. We ordered the ginseng chicken soup, spring onion pancake, steam egg and saba fish. We were a little disappointed as the food was a little bland and very ordinary. We have definitely tasted better ginseng chicken soup at other korean restaurants and the rest of the dishes were also so so, except the pancake which was quite nice. Ambience was nothing to shout about, and it was quiet during the evening. Price was comparable to other Korean restaurant (average price per dish about $15-20). We prefer the Korean restaurant at Amara Hotel where the taste and quality of food is definitely abover average
