There are other branches but this is the one I liked best. Always get a cup (or 2) when I am in the area especially if my kids are with me. The price is not cheap but the drink is delicious. And if you add a coconut ice-cream topping, WOW.... That said, the ice-cream topping is NOT necessary to enjoy the drink but it is a nice extra. There are many flavors (mixes) but I personally like the plain original one
