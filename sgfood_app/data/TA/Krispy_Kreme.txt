Really, it's just, OK. You won't go wrong either way. Depending on your fancy that day, they have choices, so, am sure one will suit your palate. Pricey though, that's my personal opinion. Donut choices are galore in Singapore, so... .

They have many flavours. But now that there are so many donut companies around this one hasnt got the same charm as before

What I like about Krispy Kreme is the consistent taste around the world. Bought the chocolate sprinkles and glazed. Light and enjoyable. Good for a sugar fix whilst in Singapore. Staff helpful and quick.

I love donuts! I always buy donuts..Krispy Kreme is a little too too sweet for us. Still it cna be personal preference. Considerable queue during lunch time hour as nearby office crowd. Otherwise, no queue at all!
