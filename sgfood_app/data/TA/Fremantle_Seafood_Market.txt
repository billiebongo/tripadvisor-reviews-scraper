The ambiance and food were great but the server was abit unexperienced and spilled balsamic vinaigrette on my friend and did not notice/help clean it up. But other than that, the food and setting was great =)
1
Worst service ever! Food extremely over priced. Worst place we ate in Singapore. Do yourself a favour and avoid.
2
Did not offer lunch menu until asked, service very slow and inattentive. Drinks were very expensive. Chairs were dirty.
5
There are no lunch sets, and items on the menu are a tad pricey. But quality of food was good, especially the fried calamari.
5
Food was good. We had salted egg squid and chili crab. Price is reasonable for 900gms crab. Nice place to hang out and chill with friends. Service was excellent. A must visit place when in Clarke Quay.
1
No service to rate! Appalling, ridiculously over priced! 3 dishes 4 drinks (this includes 2 cokes) $152 !! TOTAL RIP OFF!! AVOID LIKE THE PLAGUE. 3 dishes were green chicken curry, satay sticks, beef rib and steamed rice. Nothing extravagant but so not worth this kind of money!
1
I think the cooking team should be ashamed of the waiting team.While the food is just OK (probably some of it was frozen or industrial - lobster bisque for example), the service is absolutely terrible. Orders miraculously got right initially, but afterwards it was a catastrophy. Glass of white wine was room temperature, almost impossible to drink, all the 4 waiters would disappear and the bar was totally messy. They brought the wrong order to our table (ordered red, they brought white wine) and 20 minutes after we finished our dishes - a joke!Took another 15 minutes to get the check and leave the place, to never go back again

First night in Singapore on this trip and we were looking for somewhere to eat and decided to give this place a try. As others have said, it is in a good location, right on the riverside on Clarke Quay and I guess that probably explains the prices, because the food in my opinion doesn't warrant them. Also, the cocktails were expensive and light on alcohol, although the lychee martinis were delicious. The menu has plenty of choice, with lots of seafood dishes and some meat options. Having asked the waitress about the portion size, I order a cockle dish on it's own, but I was still hungry once I'd eaten it, so I ordered the salt egg squid, which was a good move as it was lovely and much nicer than the cockles.Service was okay, but a bit patchy, especially as they became busier. We did have to wait some time for our meals to arrive, even though it wasn't particularly busy at that point.Was pleasant enough, but I wouldn't rush back, especially given the number of other options in the area
3
Delightful ambience: A lovely setting right on the water at Clarke Quay. Great view from a waterside table. Staff were sufficiently attentive and friendly. The fried softshell crabs were delicious. perfectly prepared. The black pepper crab, however, was disappointing, as the claws were slightly undercooked. It was, moreover, VERY expensive. One can enjoy better black pepper crab, for a fraction of the cost, at Newton Food Centre
1
We were encourage to get a table at this restaurant with the offer of spend $100 and receive $30 gift voucher off the meal. We ordered the surf and turf for 2 people costing $100.The menu described a whole lobster and rib eye steak. Well what we did receive was a small lobster and if lucky 1 x 200gram scotch fillet steak, a handful of baby chat potatoes and some greenery with no dressing. two soft drinks and a bottle of sparkling water that was delivered after we finished the meal. We were both left feeling hungry and the cost of the meal after the voucher was $120. I wouldn't recommend and wished I had of complained and got my money back. Poor table service as well and had to even ask for the bill twice. Its wasn't even busy
5
dine-in with friends and appreciate jerome's service. food is nice. recommended place for diners that visit clarke quay area.
5
Really romantic place in the evening seating by the river. Freshest seafood in town as the crabs and lobster were live in the tank and prepared upon ordering.
5
Great place to have food and drinks along the Singapore River
Food was good! Quite pricey but still okay as we really enjoyed our seafood dinner along the Singapore Riverüëçüèªüëçüèªüëçüèª
View was splendid especially at nightüòäüòç
5
Great food, atmosphere and service! Food delicious and the view of the river was beautiful at night! Our favorite was the black pepper crab but everything was amazing, will definitely come back!
5
Fremantle got the freshest seafood you can taste. Waiters are friend. Just have to award of spicy food if you are not able to handle it.
1
Terrible place, no service, poor foof quality, 8 sin dollars for a glass of coke ( full of ice cube )!!!Crazy, please do mot enter, do not book a table there!!! I spent twice the price of a 1 michelin star restaurant at marina bay!!! Believe me, not a good place in Singapore!
5
Visited this place after sunset on a weekday night; the place was not too packed, food arrived fast and tasted awesome. The place offers a really nice view over the the Singapore river. Can recommend the black pepper crab if you're looking for something local with great flavor
4
While strolling through the bars and entertainment area at Clarke Quay in Singapore I got hungry and found Fremantle Seafood. The restaurant is located directly on the Singapore River and I got a perfect table with a view to the river.The waiters were friendly and the order was processed quickly. My food was very nice and I would definitely recommend the place, since it is also close to some good open-air nightlife spots across the road
1
My family and I ate dinner at this restaurant 18/4 in the evening. My husband ordered T-Phad Thai (seafood), and a couple of hours later he got really sick and threw up the entire dinner. Also, the plates we recieved were dirty, there were stains in them. However the rest of the food tasted ok, but I do not recommend this restaurant
2
Restaurant was hot in the afternoon without aircon. The kitchen is opened late although we made a reservation we had to wait a long time under the hot weather for our food. It was advertised they have one for one set on the first monday of each month but the staff said it is unavailable. A small cup of ice lemon tea cost $14. It was an unpleasant experience. Please adjust your expectations when you are there. It is a place for tourist
5
I was having dinner with my family last week,the local food was nice,especially the chili crab.I was enjoy my dinner with siting beside a river
5
It was a great experience with my wife. Their chilli crab is one of the best. With an excellent service from the staff they are very accomodating and attentive. We will be back with friends.
5
Fremantle is a perfect place to try local food especially the chilli crab, i enjoyed the night with my wife while sitting by the river and watching boats passing by. service is very outstanding. thank you and will comeback soon with relatives and friends.
4
We enjoyed a delicious seafood dinner, good suggestions made by the waitress. I like the Asian style of sharing as there was so much to choose from.
4
Great service, very friendly staff.
The view is great, right on the waters edge. Perfect to watch the nightlife.
The food was delicious, with great seafood.
Highly recommend
5
Come sit by the river at Clarke Quay and have a wonderful Chilli Crab pizza which is what I had . Great food and service - views amazing. Staff were fantastic - nice clean tables.
5
I went to clarquay fremantle seafood restaurant 2 days ago the food and the service was excelent..shoutout to Joanne who was very friendly and have a great smile and she is very attentive when we enter to the restaurant with my family.she also very good in recomending the food.we enjoyed eating singapore chilli crab and the Cod fish and Chips it's the best place to dine in with your family and loved ones with awesome staff and food was really delicious will surely comeback highly recomende
5
My husband and I were looking for a perfect restaurant to try some seafood. We tried different restaurants before. And i would say this was the best experience ever! The sg chili crab was so delicious. It was worth the price and we almost try all the local foods that they have. They exceed my expectation and I would definitely come back and try all. ‚ù§Ô∏è
5
drop by to see Singapore river and was greeted by friendly staff of the restaurant hence decided to dine in there. with the recommendations of the staffs, we tried the Singapore chili crab and is really one of a kind. Superb!! so are the lobster bisque, soft shell crab and the 'make merry' seafood platter that really blew my mind away. food is affordable and service is rather good, would recommend others to try it too
5
Had to have Singaporean Chilli crab once this trip and after visiting gardens by the sea headed to Clarke Quay. Singaporean Chilli Crab and frozen Margaritas sitting on a riverside table. Food excellent just the right heat and staff were attentive and excellent. Great way to finish our trip.
4
We enjoyed the chilli crab which was messy to eat but good fun. Yes it was expensive but who knows? Everything in Singapore is expensive. Our waiter was friendly and helpful and we had a great evening in a lovely setting by the river.
4
Food is nice. Staff are friendly. However, expect about to 30 mins wait during lunch despite no crowd
1
Not cheap, slow service, looooong wait for ok food. The location is nice and thats the nicest thing I have to say. We won't be coming back.
5
I love this place!! Delicious food and a variety of cuisines you can choose from. Fresh coffee beans, homemade donut, honey cake! You name it! They even have malaysian food! It made easy for halal eaters as well!
2
Nothing special. The foods taste ordinary. Worse than cheaper restaurants in Singapore. Not fresh. Not worth visiting.
5
The price that we paid is worth for the quantity and freshness of the seafood with the fantastic view by rthe iverside.
4
Dined at Fremantle seafood market during NYE. We had the battered Barra and Snapper which were both extremely well cooked. Thin, light batter with nice fresh fish, a light salad and a very good bottle of NZ Savvy. Would recommend this location for lunch or dinne
4
Nice place with attentive staff. They shut at 11 and the staff as long as they are there are attentive. No over the top behaviour. The food was good. They ask and make suggestion as and how needed. That's a positive for me. The wife had a red snapper curry which she raved about. What i would complain about through is the cost of one item. If one is eating a veg fried rice then it ought not to cost 18 dollar. That's a rip off for sure. Everything else was fine. Just somehow felt that they punished me for eating veg. That aside, great place and away from the loud hustle of Clarke quAy. It gets my vote for the food
2
Small group year end gathering & we were all craving Australia seafood, so picked here ... & left disappointed.Table against the water while it rained was great! 1st disappointment was beer bucket came with cold-ish water (not ice) so beers were warm! Entree was 12 oysters ... never have I had oysters with completely no flavour ... until today. Service is not attentive & with so many different people serving you, mistakes & mix-ups almost became comical ... almost .One saving grace was good mains! My Crabilious Bag has plenty of flavour, & the baked fish also good, though needs sides.We left disappointed & prefer to try / risk elsewhere rather than return.
4
This place is one of many restaurants situated alongside the water. It was mostly empty during the lunch time and one the staff there offered us a good discount on lobster dish. We decided to give it a go and were surprised y the quality of the dishes. We ordered a local crab cooked in bag in hot sauce and also grilled lobster. Both dishes were really good and tasty. I rarely order lobster as I am not a big fun, and most of them are not really good unless very fresh and from cold waters like Canadian or Scottish lobsters. But this one was decent and well cooked. Crab was fantastic, despite we had to break clams ourselves risking to splash souse onto our cloves. It was certainly good experience and fantastic lunch. We thank you the person, who invited us in and happy to recommend this place
4
Just went to the place and pleasantly surprise to see new menu besides usual western seafood dishes. New menu consisted of whole steamed fish cooked in chinese style, stingray,
I ordered white wine and steamed fish .
Steam fish (whole) $28 and white wine $15.
4
Great bar (drinks and hot chips) to catch up with friends. Seems popular without the noise. Bucket of 5 beers $45 (different varieties). Fun place to go for Aussies homesick for Freo WA!!
1
It was my first time in Singapore, on the way to London in early September. I live near Fremantle in Australia, so decided to treat myself to a whole crayfish at lunch. Soon after lunch, we went to Raffles for a drink and that's where the trouble started - I could not even finish my first beer! I was incredibly sick and in a lot of pain for 3 days. I suggest you stay FAR away from them
4
Went on a Friday night around 8pm and was happy to find this place to have late dinner. We like that it was family-friendly and not so noisy and crowded among this area that is filled with bars and clubs. There were still plenty of seats available although the tables near the river were all taken up. Food choices aren't a lot but there is a menu of local delicacies. The fish and chips was nice but nothing too fanciful. The sambal chili clams was nice though. The price range is about $10+ to $20+ for each dish. It may not be the most valuable option if you just want to dine but for the atmosphere it is still a good experience overall. The staff were quite friendly too
4
The location is extremely good as it is right on the Singapore river. Food was acceptable but the noise from the "Canned" music was far too loud as they attempted to compete with the other live bands from other venues. Possibly not the place if you wish to enjoy a conversation with friends. Value for money all the same
1
It was nice to sit by the water and look at the beautiful views. The food was $24 and $28 for 12" very think crust pizza that was not so tasty. When we asked the waiter what the size of the pizza was, he said 8 slices. Haha. A 6" pizza or a 30" pizza also have 8 slices. The total bill with 2 drinks was $90.
3
We had dinner here after our check-in at the nearby hotel. Service was very slow. We had to wait until our food came for our drinks to arrive and then suddenly all the food came at once. The food was nice and tasty nothing spectacular as I was very hungry after arriving from Hong Kong. The location was beautiful as you can see what's happening along the river. It's a good spot to relax and dine
5
Great location on Clarke Quay for people watching or just hanging out. Good value in beer towers or Beer buckets. We love them Chilli Mud Crabs here and return just for them. opens late into night. A bit pricey but pay for the spot / vie
3
Well honestly, we went in for the 5 beer bucket combo along with the Fish & chips. But the fish & chips basket looked pretty ordinary. We had to wait for some time for our order to be taken by the waiters. After finishing our drinks and some starters, we had moved out to try food at other places with Clarke Quay.So it's pretty ok to have nice time seeing the river view along with drinks, having a casual conversation with friends & family and try some seafood
3
We were looking for somewhere to eat and having decided on seafood wandered past this restaurant. The lady showed us the the local menu and so we decided to have the tiger prawns, fish fried rice and vegetables. The prawns were very good, freshly cooked and nicely spiced; the rice and veg were also good. The service was a little slow but as we were on holiday we weren't in such a rush. Not too expensive either and good for people watching
3
It's all about the view here I reckon and for enjoying a nice drink or two while watching the boats go by. Tried the fish and chips which seemed a bit ordinary and a little disappointing. To be fair we didn't try anything overly exotic so my advice would be to try something more local on the menu.Overall, not a bad place to spend a bit of time in good company
5
We had the Oven Roasted Whole Barramundi here and I must say, Ms Jenn played a big role in getting us the same ready for us. we had a good walk in the restaurant, Chef showed us whats he gonna cook. Thankyou Jenn for making the evening special for me and my wife
3
To be honest, I had not read all the mainly negative reviews about this place before, otherwise I'd have probably skipped it. So I gave it a shot while searching for some place to have a late dinner and drinks. Overall, my experience was ok. Food was decent (shrimp fritters & Barramundi), service ok and the atmosphere nice with a lovely river view and some live music from the neighbouring places. Prices are on the high side though, but I guess that applies for pretty much all the places in that area. I would probably not have eaten the more fancy food like Lobster in Freemantle but for a fish & chips type of food with drinks it's good enough
2
We had a lunch here. We were supposed to eat in another seafood restaurant, but that was closed and Clark Quay was pretty dead. Really no people at lunch time. This was the only restaurant nearby with some customers so we stepped in.We ordered sambal clams, baby lobsters, tiger prawns and sting ray. In addition we got some fried rice. Well they did not have clams, so we had some blue mussels with chilli and white wine sauce. The pros-Baby lobster was very good.-Squid was tasty (but hey we did not order it...).The cons-Very slow service. -They clearly did not know what is available.-Mistake as we got squid not stingray (waiter did not write down our order).-Tiger prawns did not taste fresh, not bad, but simply not fresh enough.-Same with the mussels. Yuk.-We did not order black pepper or chilli crab as starting prices were 108 per piece or more. Over priced indeed.Its is not worth the money. Lunch for 200 Singapore Dollars is too much. Service charge is 10% and tax 6%. Jumbo restaurant nearby is not great, but its clearly better value for money. I would prefer eating on east coast. I would not eat here again. 2 stars rating due to poor service and high prices. Please do note that I believe this is ok place for fish & chips and couple of pints of cold Tiger beer. Keep it simple. Location is nice
4
My husband wanted to try the Singapore chilli crab but the crab at different places around town was very expensive, and you don't get a lot of meat out of them. Fremantle gave him the option to have the Singapore crab sauce with a lobster and he was rapt. I had butter poached lobster with mushroom ravioli. We had a wonderful evening on the riverside watching the river boats as we are our lobster. House white was perfectly good
4
My first review!!! Decided to write about this place I stumbled upon. Picked this place because we couldn't decide if we wanted western or eastern food. Fortunately this place had both! The steamed prawns (i think its Cantonese style) looked plain and it was surprisingly very satisfying. Also ordered the sambel stingray which was both sweet and spicy if that's your thing. The star of the evening was definitely the hot seafood platter, it had a good variety of seafood suitable for dining in groups. Not forgetting the great view and the nice evening breeze of cos. Service was not the faster but acceptable
3
Was there on a Tuesday night and took the outdoor table. Very windy as it's next to the Singapore River, overlooking The Central. Food was ok except that they ran out of Barramundi fish, which was a typical Australian food. A little disappointed over that. Portion was not big, even though they said it's a sharing portion. Mostly patronised by fellow Australians and tourists as can be seen on that night. Not many locals. Only 2 or 3 waiters, so service can be a little slow
5
We shared the cold seafood platter which could easily be enough for three. On the menu it said that it comes with 1/2 a lobster but we got a whole small one. Everything was so fresh and cooked to perfection (lobster, crabs, mussels and octopus) and the sashimi was superb. S$188 including service and taxes with drinks and garlic bread (gotta have some carbs!). Very good value for quality and location.
2
Selected Fremantle for the fish and chips as we were not looking for spicyChose salmon and barramundi for the two meals; both OK but no better and no worse then your local chipieService was slow; the table next to us had to complain twice after at least twenty minutes when their main didn't show. Adding 10% service for taking the order and bringing a couple of meals and drinks to the table was robbery. Wine prices were very high; maybe that's tax but the variation / differentiation between makes and types suggests thats not all the story. No one is going to pay these prices for standard wines from Australia or South Africa, or anywhere else for that matterWhen we reflected what we'd got for ~√Ç¬£35, we were .... disappointe
1
Will never forget Jan 1, 2016 New Year's dinner at Fremantle. Since its was a late dinner and Jumbo seafood had already shut we decided to have Singapore's famous Chilly Crab at this restaurant. We had already had amazing food during our 5 nights stay in Singapore. To start with the service was pathetic. Drinks ordered took a while to reach our table. The cracker tongs and plates made its way to the table but no sign of the crab dish. Then it finally arrived ....COLD. We had to send it back to be reheated. The Chilly Crab was not anywhere close to the delicious dish it is supposed to be. After we complained the server offered us a 50 per cent discount realizing they had served us sub standard dishes. Our decision to save the best for the last turned out to be a disaster
4
Great restaurant at Clarke Quay- we were offered a $4o voucher which was a wonderful surprise- we started with the oysters- beautifully presented - then the crab- yummy - very messy but well worth every mouthful!!!
3
During our 4 days stay in sg.. we have been in this restaurant the most. We love the fish and chips... the mussels.. the seafood platter. Although the staff were not the quickest.. they were good enough to try their best to serve the customers...
1
Not cheap but should be considering the outside part of this eating establishment..... Service was next to none and the food was atrocious. Not a place I would ever return to or ever recommend.
3
Just as any other restaurant on the river this one has a great view. The food is decent, but portions are quite small and prices are quite high (probably the case for all other restaurant in this tourist location). Overall satisfied, but must admit that I left hungry. They didn't even give me a piece of bread and I was too tired to ask...
4
The fishes are quite good. I ordered the barramundi and snapper. I recommend the snapper more than barramundi due to the after taste. For $24 each , its quite affordable for tourist. But only one thing, fries was a bit oily and hence i didnt eat much of it
1
Worst service in Singapore. After waiting 20 minutes we walked up to the staff and asked politely if we could perhaps have a menu and just maybe order a drink. Another 10 minutes and we had to virtually stand up and dance on our chair to get their attention. Finally drinks arrived! Yey. The food menu looks good but you will not actually get what you order. No matter what you order it will not arrive as per the menu description. Sides will change, cooking style will change. The staff just don't care. My husband received his main well before I received my starter and my main arrived about 1 minute later. Weird. Just give the place a miss. Over-priced, poor service, dodgy food
3
Visited on first night in Singapore. Drawn in by 1 for 1 offer on fish and chips. They tasted good too. Drinks really expensive √Ç¬£6 uk price for gin and tonic and it was awful. Decided to re visit. Ordered 2 x fish and chips and drinks and were charged for 2 lots. Queried bill and told they not on 1 for 1. Strange as the board was the same as before. My husband had a stand up argument at the board stating if the board hasn't changed how can the offer not apply. As he was making a scene the guy said he wasn't arguing and changed the bill. I was due 60 cents change and I walked away. he made a point of chasing me and giving me my change. This was just before we were leaving Singapore for home. It made an unpleasant ending unfortunately. The fish and chips were nice but the service made us very uncomfortable
3
We decided to go visit Fremantle Seafood Market whilst in Singapore as we had parents with us. The location is great overlooking the river and the restaurant looks very nice. We had a decent table but the service was very hit and miss and you struggled to get any of the wait staff attention. The food had good and bad points. The lobster bisque was very nice, and the Singapore Chilli crab was good. But the risotto was awful and other dishes were average at best. The wait staff were not interested in how our meals were as they never asked. This place seems more like a restaurant to lure in tourists and visitors. If you lived in Singapore you would give this place a miss
1
One of the worst dining experiences ever, wait staff to busy to serve due to engagment with I Phone text function. Food ordered was lobster 30 to 40 minute wait then wife's was served thermidor not mornay as ordered, both our lobster's lacked meat but full off water in claws and body, noticed they served lobster tortilla's so perhaps that's were our meat went. All in all an expensive lesson, plenty of other seafood places close by. Wouldno recommend this place to anybody
3
In addition to the other reviews, it is not a 2 rated restaurant. 4 drinks, 5 main courses came quickly and tasted actually quite good. Service is indeed below average and portions are quite small. But overall, good location and food, it deserves a 3.5 rating, but not more than that
2
We went here for tea. Don't bother. Food expensive and not nice. Service slow. The staff dint want to be there. Ignored us completely. Didn't clear the table. Only good point was the view.
4
A nice restaurant to enjoy a drink and eat some fresh seafood. This place caters to all tastes. It has the local Singapore favourites and good pub food. A good change if you want to try something different to a typical Singapore restaurant.
1
The reviews are right. It's appalling.
Tiny portions, packet desserts, offered coffee served in a kitchen measuring jug.
Should have realized when the place was empty.
Don't go

Right beside the G-Max bungee lies Freemantle Seafood Market. No doubt my favourite seafood place in Clarke Quay. After making a 50% off Eatigo booking, I couldn‚Äôt wait to satisfy my lobster cravings that I‚Äôve been putting off for quite awhile now. The thought of having live lobster at $34 made it even sweeter.he Lobster Thermidore that I saw swimming in the tank just 15mins earlier is served on my table. It was huge ! The taste ? Pure awesomeness. The lobster was cut up and tossed in a seasoned cream sauce, with hints of cardamom and then carefully inserted back into the shell. The dish came with a salad and fried wedges.No words can describe the these umami packed earthy morsels of delight. I usually rate mushroom dishes on how much earthiness the cook/chef can bring out of them. This one was a clear 10/10. I‚Äôm not sure if its the fact that it was cooked under high heat in an iron mini-pot or what, but you owe it to yourself to try this side dish.More Pictures :http://www.checkmyhacks.com/food/fremantle_seafood_market

I'm a local. A few years ago, I read a positive review of Freemantle Seafood Market when it first opened. Since then, I have always wanted to check it out, but never did. A month ago, I saw a Groupon deal offering a "Crabilicious Bag" comprising of four spanner crabs, some clams and prawns, and some grilled corn, all served in a sauce of your choosing, at a 36% discounted price of approximately US$25. I bought two of this Groupon deal and my wife and I went there for lunch today. We were very disappointed with our experience at this restaurant. Firstly, service was lackluster with the wait staff initially nowhere to be found, and the restaurant was devoid of people at 12:45pm. Even after when we located some assistance, the waitress was just perfunctory. Secondly, the crabs they served must have been frozen for so long that their flesh had become powdery and shrunken, totally devoid of any taste or texture. Moreover, the clams were slightly stale. Only the two prawns and four cuts of grilled corn were acceptable in quality. The only plus points were the Cajun spice and garlic sauce was tasty, but not so the chilli crab sauce. Also, the root-beer, which cost approximately US$4.50 per glass, was fresh and decent in size.On balance, given the poor quality of the crabs, I found this restaurant to be very bad value for money, and would recommend all to avoid dining here
3
We'd heard good things about Fremantle and the first night we were at Clark Quay it was heaving - seemingly confirming this reputation. Second night we got a table overlooking the river but what a disappointment the food turned out to be. It wasn't bad; it just wasn't anything special. It was average
2
We ate here twice during our couple of days in Singapore. I think most reviews I've read are accurate. The service is very slow, an almost 'couldn't care less if you order or not' Lots of staff in evidence, but I still had to go to the bar to ask if someone could be bothered to take our drinks order (Sense of humour also lacking in staff!)One meal was only a shared pizza at lunchtime - not really a lot you can get wrong with that, so it was OK. The other meal was in the evening and I had my favourite Barramundi - small portion, but excellent.Yes, it is a little overpriced, but you're paying for the location, so order the cheapest drink and sit here all day watching the river activity - it could take an hour to be served

My husband and I have just spent 2 nights on a stopover in Singapore before flying to Australia for our honeymoon. Staying at Clarke Quay, we ate at a lovely Chinese restaurant last night and decided to try Fremantle this evening. We were greeted by a surly waiter who didn't take long to bring the overpriced drinks. A short time later he brought 2/3 of my meal- tempura prawns and sweet potato fries. We wondered where my husbands order had got to and enquired as to its whereabouts around 5 minutes later. He muttered something about my fried food being quicker than my husbands linguine and walked off. We were then given the final 1/3 of my meal- assorted vegetables and again asked where my husbands meal was. He mentioned something about it being on its way. my husband expressed that we werent happy as we understandably wanted to eat our meals together but he more or less shrugged his shoulders and again walked away. My food by the way was terrible. Prawns were greasy and clearly straight from the freezer. We then spoke to the manager who didn't apologise, didn't offer to sort out the meal for us and seemed thoroughly dis interested. We left soon after. The customer service here was non existent, the staff didn't give a monkeys and the food (that we did receive) was dire. Overall a very disappointing experience and not up to the usual high standard in this lovely City

We went here for a drink one afternoon after we'd had lunch elsewhere. There were 5 other people there (I counted) and 4 members of staff yet we still had to go to the bar to remind the girl that we were waiting for our ginger beers!We decided to try it for dinner a couple of nights later as it looked a bit busier (instead of 5 other people there were now around 12). My meal was good, big portions. We got a side of onion rings to share, they were yummy! My husband got the chilli crab and said it was delicious - at $90 just for the crab, no accompaniments, it would want to be delicious!We had 1 drink each, 1 main course each, 1 side order between us, no starters, no desserts and the bill was $210 SD. Singapore is a fairly expensive city to eat and drink out but this place is ridiculously overpriced! I found the staff in this restaurant rude, inattentive and all of them had that "I'm too good to serve you" attitude that so many young Singaporeans in the hospitality trade seem to have.Overall, this restaurant is in a prime spot by the river with lively bars nearby and bumboat cruises passing every few minutes. The location is stunning, it's a pity the staff have such bad attitudes and refuse to smile! This strip of Clarke Quay will always be a busy area but if the management of Fremantle Seafood put a bit of effort into training their staff and lowered their prices slightly they would have a full house and fantastic atmosphere every night instead of only a few tables filled and the atmosphere of a morgue
4
This is a very nice restaurant on the river. I had fish and chips crumbed and it was delicious. The only issue would be the service. I wasn't asked if I needed anything after the meal was served...I may have needed another drink but it was minor
4
Enjoyed the place, Food was great, service was good. sit outside. they had the best chilli Crab in the Quay area. the location offers a vantage point to the quay area.
3
Food was pricey but nice enough, we had the Chilli Crab. Service was very average. Probably wouldn't return again for a meal.

Ordered a seafood platter. Quality was so bad: sashimi is not as fresh as they should be, tapas was tasteless, they are all placed in an ice bowl but the food was not cool enough!! Cost is very high vs such quality!!

Stopped late Friday night for food and drinks... sat inside. Wasn't busy but service was very slow for drinks and food... food was terrible.. apart from pizza which was okay but not worth the price... there are definitely better places...

My husband and I went to Clarke Quay for a look around and liked the look of the menu and decided to sit down for some dinner. We initially went inside and waited for someone to serve us (no one to be seen) and then realised all the staff were out in the outdoor seating area. We were then seated and given menus. We chose our meals (garlic bread as a starter, seafood basket for hubby and snapper for me) but it took at least a good 15 minutes for the waiter to come back and ask us for our order, despite trying to get their attention multiple times. The garlic bread was fine, and came out in a reasonable time (considering there were only three other tables with customers). My husbands seafood basket came out and the waiter said my snapper was on its way. Ten minutes later no sign of it. Then we noticed my meal sitting on the kitchen table, clearly waiting for someone to bring it to my table. Another three or four minutes and finally it was served to me. My husband had nearly finished his meal completely by this time. The food was not great, the service poor and the drink prices are expensive ($6 for a small glass of pepsi and no refills!). Disappointing.

This is quite a nice restaurant on the edge of Clark Quay with a large outdoor seating area.The food itself is really good, we had the mussels in butter and herb sauce with the grilled king prawns and shrimp tempura, all of the dishes tasted really good.However they all came in very very small portions, especially the mussels.The service is very friendly, however the restaurant is significantly understaffed and therefore getting the attention of the waiter (which in our case was only one serving the entire outdoor seating area) can be rather challenging

looked good in a happening area. they have a small display of fresh seafood inside so thought ok. we went for the seafood basket to get a selection of seafood. served up regular over battered and overcooked basket of mixed seafood about what you would get at a shopping centre area. Disappointe

I loved the chilli crab I had, but my family did not enjoy the seafood basket or the fish and chips they each had.Don't think it will be a cheap exercise, after a couple of drinks and the above mentioned the bill came to $282 S

We had fish and chips - barramundi on Saturday afternoon. While expensive $24, it was nice and a reasonable serve. Service was slow. Despite this, we returned Sunday afternoon dor an early dinner before heading to the airport home. Again, we had the barra. We ordered drinks and waited 20 mins for them despite being the only ones on the waterfront deck. I asked for tapwater to take medication and this was provided promptly. We ordered and sat back and took in the view. W had time to take a loooong lingering view as meals took 45 mins to arrive. We prompted them. Barra not as big as yesterdays serve. Other drawback, we were seated in nonsmoking however next to smoking area. More for convenience of staff. We had to move when 2 men sat beside us and lit up their puffies right next to us. Soooooo rude but legal here. Lots of muttering from me and we moved ourselves. Spoiled our meal. After finishing, we noticed someones order sitting on restaurant window, waiting to be picked up by wait staff. Sat there awhile. Also poked head in fresh fish area which was shut. Noticed some rotting mouldy lemons in front display case next to display of oyster shells. Customer service def needs picking up

We stopped here for a late lunch and ordered the Premium Fish and Chips : our choice was Barramundi in panko crumbs. Fresh, hot and delicious, with the trademark friendly service, and right on the Singapore River at Clarke Quay. Fantastic.

Went with another couple. The $90 chilli crab was frozen, tasteless and most of the meat had been removed. seafood basket was heavily battered and also not fresh. Never again!

Great location on the banks of the Singapore river. Food was OK, but nothing special. Service was pretty slow, (15 minutes for an iced tea, with only 6 customers in the restaurant).

Had the "Make Merry" seafood platter - which should be the easiest thing to make (as it's just simple steamed seafood, some small tapas, and some sashimi). The sashimi was good, but everything else was terrible. The lobster was the toughest I'd ever had, the shrimp were slimy, the oysters were scary. I thought that by visiting a place that specialised in seafood would be a safe guard against the "Don't order seafood on Monday" rule, but I'm praying that I don't get sick from what I did eat. My family and I left most of it behind. When I asked the waiter (Joanne) when the lobster was cooked, she said, "Yesterday." When I started to ask about when some other things were cooked (i.e. shrimp), she started to backpedal. The seafood is not anything approaching fresh, and for the price, it should be much better. Simply put: DON'T. EAT. HERE. I don't care that they're on the waterfront, eat your seafood anywhere else. As for me, I'm hoping that I don't end up puking my guts out in the next hour

Please avoid this place if you can. The name, look and location made me think about the wonderful seafood from Australia but Oh! I was wrong. I ordered the lobster bisket since it was a cheff special. I strongly believe it came from a low sodium, low fat, can of tomatoe soup. My husband had the fish and chips and it was not any better. And I think the waiter knew because she never asked how the food was. Please spend you hard earned money somewhere else. This place is not worth a penny

Went past this restaurant a few times and it always looked appealing. Decided to try it as they had tables available by the river front and was hanging out for a nice cold beer.Firstly, I have to agree with one reviewer that this is just a place hoping to catch unsuspecting tourist and not aimed at the repeat customer.I have been a visitor to Singapore frequently, and love the place. But I can't say I love Fremantle. The service was okay, the beer cold, the views great. I suppose I shouldn't have expected the prices to be low but dinning on my own I saw no need to live it up ordering lobster or fresh seafood. Leave that for another occasion with friends. Judging by some of the reviews here I'm glad!I ordered the seafood basket, and the waitress did warn me it was a lot of fried food! But I felt like comfort food and was looking forward to the naughty calories!!It arrived very quickly, which always makes me say to myself, 'the microwaves working' , and low and behold, everything except the fries is encased in batter. I thought there may have been something in breadcrumbs but no, two big pieces of fish, two prawns and two octopus.The portion and presentation are good! But I could hardly get through it. The fries were the star. Maybe the cook had started at McDonalds and perfected good chips. Though the seafood should be the star.Look, I enjoyed winding down on the river with the sun slowly setting and the buzz of the Quay but there was nothing to bring me back here. It seemed to be a good place for a drink first then move on to the other surrounding restaurants as the other few diners seemed to be doing.With no response from the management to reviews on this site I was more than annoyed so decided to write this review
1
We ordered the seafood platter and the waitress tried to upsize us. There was no alcohol in the mojitos. We had to ask three times for water which they tried to charge us for. The main courses were brought before we finished our appetizers. The food was terrible. The waitresses disappeared and didn't reappear for one hour. The cost was expensive. There is absolutely no reason to ever go to this horrible place

It was a hot evening, we fancied seafood after many delicious Chinese meals. The service was quite slow even though on this Sunday evening it wasn't very busy. We did get a table by the river even though we hadn't booked. When our food finally arrived my chips were cold however the barramundi was piping hot and delicious. My husbands seafood basket was tasty. Both meals were plentiful. So our view was an overall good but three dots on trip advisor comes out as average
1
I have never had such a mixed meal, I ordered barramundi and it was just OK.But my wife ordered Lobster Mornay was delivered Lobster Thermidor, asked the waitress and she took the meal and said it was Mornay with mushrooms.Simply not good enough. Finally got the waitress to replace it with Mornay, an hour later, the meal had the same dressing (now very cold) and was at best a very mediocre meal.I look to Trip Advisor for good places to stay and eat.This is not a good meal by any means and their response to criticism was not apparent.erdict plenty of places to eat at Clark Quay this is not one of them

Having passed this restaurant almost every night for a week it was always popular. On our first night in Singapore the atmosphere was very lively with music, local boats operating the length of the river inlet. The menu is very varied and we just picked our way thro the Sashimi, crab cakes, garlic prawns and rice dish. A good selection of wines and overall a nice experience. It's certainly worth a visit
5
The lobster was amazing. Eating in the middle of Clarke Quay was also nice, with a view on the lake and all the boats. Nice experience.
1
Great location but the food is mediocre at best with small portions. Only thing good about the restaurant was the beer was nice and cold. There are much better restaurants in Singapore than this one.
3
There was nothing drastically wrong with the food, but I wouldn't recommend it as a restaurant to go to. The location is lovely, especially if you get a table next to the river, but the battered fish was very oily, the cod smelt very fishy (not fresh) and the tartare sauce looked unappetising. The salads were nice. All-in-all, an okay meal but nothing special
4
We got the last available table which bordered on next door. No real problem but the Christmas light show was a bit intense so we asked to move when we could. This was no problem and our waterside table was perfect. Good service good food if a little expensive.

Obviously not the views that are associated with the restaurants name sake down in Western Australia but for down Clarke quay the ambience is enjoyable, good drinks and good quality food and good size menuWe enjoyed the oysters and had the salmon pasta for main which was really good for not being an Italian restaurant.There are good drinks offers and good service. The beers on tap are standard for the Singapore course and looks like a good wine selection (not had the opportunity to sample yet).All in all a good place to go, similar prices or cheaper to anywhere else in Clarke qua
2
The location is nice, just along the Clarke Quay. Service was rather terrible and it took long time before the waiter came to collect the order at our table. I had some prawns and then a tasty grilled barramundi ( it was the first time I had that fish ). There's not much to say about this restaurant. Just a simple suggestion : not to save money on ( professional ) staff and the service too. Without that ... there's little hope to rise the level of this place which I would rather call snack bar rather than restaurant

We were desperate to have chilli crab when we were in Singapore, and we passed this place which was right on the river, and selling oysters too. It's quite pricey although we had about 2 and a half big crabs so I thought it was pretty good value.For me it wasn't as bad as the reviews, but maybe we got them on a good night
3
We were wandering along the river and noticed these "snack" trays (looked like a high tea server but for seafood) and having a family reasonably obsessed with seafood we thought we'd stop. The staff were quite the opposite of others along the river - they didn't stand in the footpath and beg you to come in and were reasonably indifferent even once we had come inside. I went to the bar twice to get drinks rather than wait. We ordered a SGD 150 stack of seafood which was of reasonable quality but would question the oysters. A good mix of other bits and pieces some of which was probably not the freshest. Location is OK, beers were good and the water/soft drinks (when we got them) were fine also. We probably wont go out of our way to go back there

Avoid this place at all costs! We ate here on a Saturday night because we didn't make a reservation and couldn't get a table anywhere decent. Despite it being almost empty, our food took 1 hour and 45 minutes to arrive and when it arrived it was dry and clearly just reheated from frozen. When we complained we were lied to about how much longer the food would take, and when we complained again were told that the kitchen had lost electricity so our meals had to be started again from scratch.The fish types were NOT what was advertised - we commented that the texture of the fish demonstrated that it was actually a different species to what we ordered but the staff just shrugged. Drinks are expensive, and although you sit by the river, we were downwind from smokers and all we could smell was smoke (in the non-smoking area). All in all a terrible experience and a waste of money

Got the $100 vouchers at $50 when I was at Eat at Taipei and decided to spend it at Fremantle. The location is good, riverfront and was breezy that day. Except for the group of Jap tourists, the restaurant was quite empty despite the large seating area.The service staff are either very good or very bad. The manager refused to acknowledge us even when I waved to her, but her other staff saw that and put down her plates to attend to me. Good on her! Food was okay to me, maybe because I know I will be paying half price for whatever I ordered. I guess I will call it expensive if I have to pay full price for them. Quality was decent except that the clams didnt have any white wine flavour except for some mild pepperish taste.Will I come back? Yes, ONLY if I can buy the half price vouchers again! Nice place to chill out with friends
1
Give this one a miss. It was pricey for what you got and the food was average at best. The menu says that the seafood is flown in. This may be right, but it's a long time before it is served at your table.
3
food was okay and served on nice plates, but small portions though. We also ordered mojito's and they were very nice and served in cute cans.
3
Nice location along Clarke Quay, but rather pricey food small portions and much to improve table service.

Clark Quey is a delightful area for restaurants and drinking spots. The river is serene and a nice place to chill out. My wife and I thought that Fremantle and its menu looked pretty inviting but it was downhill from the time we got a table near the river....No water or drink orders for 15 minutes until my wife found a server and put in a request. I ordered 'lemon iced tea' and got a Chinese ulong tea with no ice. When I asked the server--absurdly--told me the lemon went in first; Sorry guys, no lemon taste at all....Finally the same server came up with the correct drink-psaying she thought I needed some ice; though in fact it was a different drink, with a lemon, etc. etc.--in short, what I had ordered first. My wife's wine, she told me, was like water. My snapper was ok but well below the quality one would expect for that price. We eventually had to get up to get another server to get our bill. In short---go for the view but don't expect much for the food, drinks or service

Long wait times, forgot drinks order. Just disorganised and not customer focused at all ! The one positive I will give them was that the food was of a REASONABLE quality - nothing fantastic but not bad either. Without a doubt the worst place we have eaten in Singapore - due to poor service.
1
The best service in typeface was from the trainee. Asked for the cheap happy hour beers and they tried to charge full price because they put the order through late. Waited at least 10min for each drink when we were 1 of 3 tables in the restaurant. Ordered food which was average and charged through the roof. Manager argued with me over the bill and was very rude. One of the worst experiences I've had a restaurant will never go back and would strongly suggest no one goes near this plac

This restaurant is not a fish restaurant, what it is we do not know, but the knowledge of fish is not to be found here.Dry, not tastfull, every thing was bad, exept the location. So sit here, order a drink but get your food elsewhere.Also the staff was the same as the food was. Bad. Very bad.
1
This is definitely a restaurant I would not go back too. Service was average and food quality poor, however expensively priced. For aa fish and chip restaurant its a little too much. Finding a restaurant in the are is not hard there are plenty. If they survive they need to pick up there act
1
Why is it that restaurants think they can get away with serving poor quality food just because they have an excellent location. I had crab nachos which had bsrely been near a crab. A few tiny crumbs of meat if I was lucky. Risotto was ok but barramundi overcooked. 1st waitress refused to provide a glass of water - only bottled I was told. I asked another waiter later and was eventually provided with one Lots of choice in clarke quay. Don't choose Freemantl

We had dinner as a group here last week. Had a seafood bowl, BBQ ribs and chips between 3 people and we couldn't get through it all. The location near the water is fantastic and although a little bit pricey was no more expensive than other restaurants in Clark Quay.The highlight was the great BBQ ribs !
