We They offer a wide variety of food, but mainly with an easter influence. Cosy feeling when sitting down. Very helpful staff.
4
very good spread of food and good menu with courteous and proficient staff
they have even good options for Indian food
5
The breakfast spread is wonderful. From noodles to pancakes to porridge, you will be spoilt for choice..I particularly love my all time comfort food, chicken porridge with sliced ginger..Time for breakfast..

Had a great buffet lunch in Azur in one of my recent Singapore trips with a group of colleagues. So much choice of food, excellent quality and very friendly staff. Wonderful venue
2
We arrived from phuket to stay over night and thought we would eat at the Azur restaurant in the crown plaza hotel in Singapore. We got to the restaurant at 9pm and the salad looked like from the day before and was nearly finished. No selection and everything looked like it was from the day before. For the money we paid, there should have been fresh food even when customers arrive 2 hours before closing. We will definitely not come back.

A treat of the buffet dinner from a good friend but not sure of the price but guess it must be expensive given the classy ambience and service as well as the variety and quality of the food. Plenty of seafood with sushi and sashimi (thin slices of salmon and tuna), mussels, cold crab segments (not fleshy enough), no fresh oysters but lots of medium-sized steamed prawns. The local dishes were good , do-it-yourself kueh pieti, laksa (no cockles), Hainanese Chicken rice with good chilli and ginger sauces, saffron rice and dhall. The Western roasts looked appetising though I didn’t try them, crisp pork knuckle, tender and juicy lamb. A marvellous wild mushroom soup and a nice selection of crusty bread to go with it!Dessert was stupendous with small helpings of chocolate and strawberry short cake as well as mousses and local kueh. Need to ask for tea or coffee to be served to the table.Used plates were quickly taken away and water refilled frequently.Hard to fault this buffet as dishes were tasty without being too salty and more than enough to choose from, refined atmosphere and clientele

Went to this restaurant for its Christmas Day buffet lunch. Spread was pretty good, especially for the desserts. Had a mix of cuisines, with both Asian and Western. Quality was generally ok, except for the meats. I found that nearly all the carved meats were slightly lacking. The turkey was dry and the beef overcooked while the pork was not very flavourful, which was unfortunate. Service was slightly slow. It was also a bit dark
5
We were booked in for breakfast both mornings of our stay. The staff are prompt and courteous with a smile. There are two sides to the buffet and you are not limited to one or the other. There is one for western cuisine and one for Asian dishes. You can have bits of either or just one. There is a great variety to choose between cooked food, cereals, cakes and fruit. The quality is very good
3
The restaurant has a buffet, the dinner quality is ok, could be a little more varied in terms of spices or flavoring as a lot of it tastes the same, the breakfast buffet is more varied, lovely bread and pastries, there are lots of options just many similarities
5
The mains are limited. There is turkey and honey ham as is Christmas season. Probably enjoyed the sashimi most. Personally I don’t like the spread as compared to other hotel buffets. But I guess they try to cater to passerby who stayed overnight at hotel. Desserts spread has Christmas selection like ginger bread, cookies etc. My favourite is their bread pudding. The Bakuteh (pork ribs) soup is quite nice but sadly , no pork ribs inside. The prawn noodles has a interesting flavor which I did not enjoy. Will be good if they have plain or garlic naan since they do have the Indian cuisine
1
Had travelled a long way. Spread were limited. Replenishment of food were slow like snail. What made it worst, there was no oyster!
3
For what you pay for a buffet dinner, the food was dry, cold and not very edible. We did get to the buffet late but if the food was going to be cold or dry, then charge us less!
5
With many choices breakfast at this busy restaurant was a pleasant experience. Hot food was actually served hot and the attentive service appreciated.
3
Lunch buffet with colleagues on a Friday afternoon. The buffet selection does not have enough choices.
4
Although don't have crayfish, although don't have lobsters, although don't have Chilli crab. But it have sushi, it have curry veggies, it have carrot cake, it have my favourite desserts, and many many good foods.
4
Ate dinner here whilst staying at the crowned plaza hotel. The portions are quite large and I think good value for an hotel. Food was well cooked and the staff were pleasant. Will maybe try the buffet next time if we can work up a big enough appetite.
5
Held My Daughter's 21st Birthday Party at Azur! The Sunday Brunch Buffet was indeed SUMPTUOUS and the services rendered were REMARKABLY GOOD, especially with the cake cutting, wine & champagne pouring and table serving. Our Guests and my Family had a WONDERFUL and MEMORABLE time immersed in the cozy and beautifully decorated private area. I would highly recommend this place for group gatherings and celebrations
3
I’m sorry to say but I did not enjoy the Azur buffet. Luckily we had received a special offer from the hotel. Had I paid full price I would have been extremely disappointed.It may have just been me having a bad night but I just did not enjoy the flavour of the foods on offer.The sashimi to start was very good, but it was down hill from there. The beef was chewy and lacked flavour. The veggies were over cooked. Except the ice cream even the desserts lacked flavour.The staff were very helpful, attentive and friendly. The restaurant is nice and offered a wide choice of food.
5
During our last night in Singapore, we decided to try the dinner buffet at the Crowne Plaza Changi Airport second level. What a treat! The buffet had been divided into two large sections, which made it easy to locate what we were looking for. One side was devoted to Western dishes and the other to Asian. Each dish was well presented and identified by name. Everything we tried was distinctive in taste and absolutely delectable. The Azur Restaurant is a pleasant place to dine. The service was adequate, too. Come hungry, for it’s an expensive meal but well worth the price
5
It was my very first visit to the buffet restaurant. There were many variety of food to choose from appetisers, desserts and many more, but i suggest to place more seafood other than steam prawns, clams and mussels maybe place some like salmon.Bonus points because you are paying for the quality and quantity of food being prepared. However, Azur should look into customers needs and wants such as answering phone calls and regularly check on customers to ensure that they have better experience dining. Great place for diners who like anti social relationships with staff
4
I like the atmosphere of the restaurant and the service are good.
Only the ice dish too less variety.
4
Great ambience with a decent selection of food. Service was reasonable and staff were courteous and service oriented. There was no oysters which was a let down. Overall dining experience was pleasant and recommended for other diners.
4
A wonderful experience at Azur, with excellent spread of savoury dishes and desserts. The mala chicken was delicious, as did the curry and lamb. The ice cream flavours were great. Overall a very pleasant experience.
1
Replenishment for the chilli crab was too slow.Take abt 5-10min and only 1crab.Treat customer like begging the food.Totally disappointed,not worthy,will not patron again:(
1
The buffet is served by keeping food warm in turines which do not do the job and then there are not warmed plates = very cold food when you get to eat it
4
Using the buffet dinner and breakfast is an easy way for everyone to eat what they want. East and West cuisine catered for.
4
The ambience and decor of the restaurant is pretty chic and modern. Food is not really fantastic. Was looking forward to the Moroccan Roasted lamb but it was not on the menu that day. Instead pork knuckle was served and the skin was pretty tough. The dessert selection is pretty good though, especially the Danish Pudding and Green Tea Mochi.
4
Price is reasonable due to 1-1 promotion. Kids below 5 years old gets to dine for free. Good spread of food. Staff very helpful. Be there early. During my Dinning time there, there was a dish "Lobster with Black Pepper" but it was change to clayfish later in the evening Dinning time.
4
The food here is generally good but it is also rather expensive. The spread is generally good. The sashimi was fresh as well. The service is also decent. The meats were cooked nicely.However, the restaurant is a bit too dark for my liking. If you want, you can also ask the staff about the spread before you enter the restaurant
4
The seafood and sashimi were fresh. My favourite part of the buffet spread was the salad bar. Besides the usual leaves and greens, there are 4-5 ready-mixed salad bowls which are really tasty!! New inspiration for new salad recipes! Dessert bar is the next go-to. Ambience is nice too and service staff are attentive. I will recommend this buffet for friends or family gathering.
4
Good food (much better than the endless assortment in Changi airport). Buffet features both Asian and Western buffets. Great service and 30% discount for guests.
3
The food is not bad and we'll be back by bring ex-colleague for dinner after Malay fasting period over.
5
A wonderful way to start your day in an unfamiliar place. There are lots of food to choose from the international selection.
Tip:
1. Try the hot noodle soup. It's fresh.
2. Curry eggplant was tasty
4
Room came with free breakfast, choices were more than one could hope for in a month of stays. Menu covered several different lines of ethnic foods all fabulous!
4
Now, let's keep in mind that it was a complimentary stay due to a delayed flight. Free room, lunch, and dinner, and I ate both at this restaurant. The lunch and dinner buffet are similar with some variation, and offer enough choices to make it a fun and delicious meal even for a sophisticated foodie/chef as myself. The seafood was fresh, the salads well balanced, the meat dishes showcased the vast and varied cuisine of Singapore, and the starches and sides and desserts were appetizing and fun.
1
I was appalled yesterday evening when i was rejected at the door. I asked for a table for 2 people, and also if i could view the spread as i noticed it mentioned that it was the local cuisine spread buffet dinner. But one of the two ladies at the entrance said that they were fully booked that evening. Well, what can i say right when the management staff already told you that they are fully booked so i have to go elsewhere. What i found difficult to accept was that the tables were clearly empty between 7:15-7:30pm. And there were no queue outside the restaurant too.
3
Whilst we love the accommodation at this hotel, the restaurant is not our favourite and we prefer to eat elsewhere. The cost of breakfast buffet is about $39 in AUD, and that's expensive in anyone's book. You would have to eat a big breakfast for it to be worth that sort of money. We have also had the buffet dinner here but it's not impressive given the high cost. Best I can say is that the service is good, they have plenty of staff to wait on you.
3
The seafood dinner buffet was a bit of a let down for some of the seafood was not very fresh. There was definitely variety, but food were not replaced quick enough - possibly a lack of chefs?The waitstaff were not very attentive - it was not easy to get their attention and we had to repeat some of our requests.
5
Was in for the seafood buffet. it's a bargain. It's all you can eat crab, shrimp, mussels, Salmon, oysters, and every other fish you can think of. To top it the grilled lamb Steak. it was awesome. They also were kind enough to get some Veggie dish made for one of our mates. The cheese and fruit bar was good. The choices for desserts were plenty. Service is outstanding, and the whole experience is awesome
4
We got a really good 1-for-1 promotion with Azur Restaurant, which made it about $25 per person for our group of 16. Spread was good - lots of variety, with sashimi, oysters, and the like. Waitstaff were very attentive to our table. I do wish they would top up the buffet more frequently, though
5
I stayed at this hotel during a layover. good quality food . great service. Happy with my choice. very convenient
3
Hotel is conveniently placed if staying at the airport.Food is well prepared, but Oh so overpriced! They can do this because there is no local competition.
4
Breakfasts are very good, catering for both local and European palates. A very wide range of breakfast dishes - fruit, cereals, breads and cooked breakfast dishes. Self service. A good start to the day.
1
I am extremely disappointed with the poor customer service. Staff was not trained and had a major failure understanding simple instructions. Service ambassador in the front and the manager were rude. Not going to return there again
3
Food is alright for a buffet. Price on the high side and it usually doesnt have any promotions.
I have to clear my own plates because the staffs are always missing. Come on, the restaurant is not even half full on a friday night.
2
Visited 21-Apr-2017. 4/10.Don't think I'll come here again!The goodPrawns and Bulots on ice. Very tasty.Ice cream was nice and had Jelly beans! (I normally don't eat dessert at buffets if the other stuff are nice, go figure)Lamb chops were okay... but too undercooked and cold.The badSushi counter had only maki and prawn sushi. Not a slice of raw fish to be found.Mediocre selection except for main courses. Indian section- samosa and eggplant curry (only)Salads- showed no imagination and again selection mediocre.Rice- steamed white rice.The uglyLady taking phone reservations- curt.Mussels and clams were tasteless and soggy. Inedible and suspected they were frozen from last service and thawed
3
Firstly, very convenient, staff were tremendous and my waitress was terrific, restaurant was lovely and clean.I'd been travelling Europe for 5 weeks and stayed in Singapore for 10 days. This is the first time I felt the need to reach for a salt shaker and almost wished I'd gone else where!Don't get me wrong, food was nice, not great, just nice, which is disappointing considering the cost.I had the spatchcock - as I said it was nice, but very very basic. The restaurant is good if your tired, don't want to travel and want a basic feed, but they need to improve a little on the standard of food for the prices they are charging
3
The place was less than half full when I was there, but still several of the buffet stations were out of food, and took a long time to replenish. The food was basic and tired. My server was attentive and pleasant. This is a place to go if you're just looking to fill up, not if you're looking for a good meal of quality food
3
The variety of food here is interesting, and focuses on Western and Chinese cuisine and seafood. The sashimi spread is limited to four kinds of raw fish (at least on the day I came). The standard of cooking is above average. The service is just not impressive. The water wasn't refilled unless we requested for it, but that may be because our warm water glasses are opaque. The service staff (not the chefs) are really unfriendly too, but at least they clear plates quite efficiently. Maybe they're understaffed. The interior design is okayyy. Personally, I find it uncomfortable because the lighting is cold and minimal, and the flooring and walls are dark-coloured. The lights in one section are even switched off (which is good for saving the environment and all). I think it's okay to come here if you're not fussy about having the meal of your life, or you're one of the hotel guests dining here simply because of convenience. Of course, this meal that I've had here may just be a one off.

Had to chk in around 730am, booked the room and add the breakfast, did not really get a relaxing breakfast but from what I could see had a bit of everything so it was catered for most people. Wanted to sit on the side seats but they said no...Would I return YESRating out of 3.5: Food: 4. Service: 3.5 Value: 3.5 Ambience: 5
5
lots of choice (cold lobsters, shrimp)and good looking, and special dessert free
Valentine's Day dessert really nice.
Environment is clean and good service.
5
We were staying at the Crowne Plaza, so it made sense to eat here. We were pleasantly surprised how good the food was and we had a great waiter. We had the laksa, delicious.
2
At times long lines, rude staff, too many people to make this a nice plave for breakfast. Buffett has great selction though!
4
We had the buffet dinner and really enjoyed it with an excellent choice to suit all diners
Wine was too expensive tho
4
Excellent breakfast buffet and convenient extended hours make this hotel restaurant a winning combination.
5
I was staying at the Crown Plaza only for the night, arriving late in the evening, and having to leave early the next day. So I had the chance to experience this restaurant twice, for dinner and breakfast.On both occasions, the variety of food was excellent, with local and 'weatern' dishes. The staff were always attentive and helpful on both occasions
5
2+ weeks on the road in Singapore and Malaysia one night left before going back to Cali. We decided on the Crowne Plaza at the airport for last night since we were done exploring and needed a break. Glad we did. Great relaxation hotel. Awesome pool and gym and spa. Rooms are best we stayed in whole trip and we stayed in top 10s the whole 2 weeks. Anyway great dinner buffet. The Manager Damien went out of his way during busy dinner time to accommodate my wife's dietary needs. It was much appreciated. But even without Damien's help the buffet was amazing. I think I sampled everything. I'm soo stuffed! If ever in Singapore airport and want a good meal. Check out the dinner Buffet at Azur. Hotels awesome as well.
5
I had booked for my family of 20 persons for our CNY reunion buffet dinner at Azur Restaurant on 27 Jan 2017 and was glad that I had made the right choice . Firstly I booked early and was able to get an early bird discount of 25% off the buffet dinner. Secondly there was a wide spread of food at the buffet counters and free flow of drinks like wine , beers, fruit punch , sprite , coke , tea , coffee. In addition to the wonderful buffet spread , each table was given a plate of CNY LOHEI to toss for the CNY and each person was served with half a lobster!!!! .... that is not all, as we were about to leave , we were given a box of CNY goodies put in a beautiful box !!!!Finally A BIG THANK YOU to the staff at the Azur Restaurant on 27 Jan 2017 for your excellent and smiling service even though you all are busy cooking or serving the guests but you all are smiling and did not lose your cool including the manager who was the one and only person to do the LOHEI yet he maintain his cool and smile ! Thank you also to the reservation staff including Mei Sim who did my reservation with patience : )You have made my family and I very happy and tummy satisfied with the wonderful food and service !!!!!!
3
I had buffet breakfast here as part of my staycation and while it suffices for a breakfast before my day starts, the quality can be improved. The fried mee and bee hoon was just really bland. For some strange reasons, the entire restaurant is also rather dark, so it feels gloomy all the time. Better lighting perhaps
4
It was an impromptu decision but a good one to dine here for dinner on Sunday! The seafood selection was sumptuous and fresh even though I was disappointed that oysters were noticeably absent: green mussels, flower crab, slipper lobster (crayfish) and dog conch shells on ice; baked scallops with cheese (yummy!!), black mussels with white wine and fennel, black pepper rock crab, penang style fish curry and tuna/salmon/tako sashimi. The dong Bo pork belly was tender yet not fatty. The dessert was not fantastic and that's really a pity. But for $65++ I think it's reasonable.
4
the service provided in the restaurant was great if u are those who dont like to have lots of unwanted plate and those picky eater i think the restaurant will not disappoint you as they have variety of food
4
Excellent spread of food with good variety and flavours representive of Asian and Western cuisines. The service staff were attentive despite the crowd.
5
Only ate the breakfast buffet here but the quality of the food, extensive selection, and beautiful decor left an impression on us. Worth the price and just what we needed after a good sleep following a long flight the day before.
4
Service was great. The staff refilled the food promptly when it's running low but not much variety in terms of food selection.
4
Had the buffet here while staying at the hotel, they give a 30% discount to people staying at the hotel which made it good value.
4
It was a pleasant surprise. The food has improved since i visited azur 5 months ago. And now the dishes are labelled for various food allergens. Although incomplete, is really a good start. Seafood was fresh. Maybe only the crab less so.
4
We went for buffet dinner on 30 Dec and brought along our baby in a stroller. The restaurant arranged a corner seat which was quieter for us. The food was good, there's a reasonable variety of food, and waiters were helpful. Only thing that I felt could be better was the variety of beverages. They only serve water, tea or coffee for beverages
3
We arrived Singapore at 8pm and decided the buffet at Azur Crowne Plaza Hotel was the best option for dinner not a lot of difference from other buffet we have been to. A good range of food and the service good, wine was well overpriced compared with other countries, if you like buffet it was okay
4
Ate here in the evening recently while awaiting a flight out of the airport. While the evening buffet looked great(extensive offerings to please most any tastes), it was more than we wanted/needed. Ended up having their Wagyu Beef Burgers and beers. Great burgers, however somewhat pricy as the total bill came to just under $100 (US) for two burger meals & 3 beers. While we didn't stay at this hotel (our other traveling companions did), I can't think of a nicer, more convenient place to stay if you want/need an airport hotel. Very friendly, accommodating staff
5
Variety of food is reasonable. Worthy for the $28++ weekday buffet lunch promo. Food includes crayfish, prawns, mussels, lamb chop, kurobuta pork ribs( very tender) & more. The curry fish head is nice. Sushi range is limited. Love the dessert section, most of them are not too sweet & taste good. Drinks they only serve water, coffee & tea which will be better if it includes soft drinks or juices
5
Only had breakfast here whilst staying at the hotel. The buffet was quite impressive with excellent choices for both Western and Asian dishes. Lots of fresh fruit as well.
4
The staff were very attentive and were around to offer help if needed. The kitchen crew were also very Friendly
4
Good variety of food to start your day, choices from Asian to American. Friendly staff and quick service. For IHG member, you can even takeaway coffee if you're in a rush.,
4
A good range of different foods at the buffet. Good service and pleasant staff. Good for breakfast and dinner.
3
I have been to the weekend brunch with international spread. it has a mixture of chinese and western but I felt the spread was so-so and they are slow to refill which I feel it kills my experience dining there. I have love IHG property but this disappoint me
5
We had the buffet lunch on a sunday. The spread was quite wide, with a good mix of various cuisines. Despite the massive crowd, the restaurant kept refilling the food. The overall quality of the food was also good, with even my kids pretty satisfied (and they usually are picky).Given that i came here because of a credit card discount promotion, I'd have to say that the final bill was definitely reasonable given the overall quality of the food. Without the promotion, I'd say it would be a bit too pricey
4
Considering not many would go to Azur, it being at airport compared to other buffet spread it was a value for money. As expected, not as expensive as city hotel, at the same time choices is a bit lesser, but it justifies the cost. Very nice ambience. Parking not a problem as buses and mrt goes to airport, also loads of parking space. Not sure as i didn't read or see any Halal Certificate, but it is a no pork, no lard restaurant. I did see a couple of Malay families dining as well.They had western, asian and Japanese as the main theme. I liked the roast lamb. It was simply amazing and the deserts were quite good too. They are kids friendly and along with high chair my son was well looked after. Service is also good. If anyone looking for a good range of Indian-Malay food like in city restaurant, you may not find it here, at least the day we went.Overall a nice experience as it at the Airport, so feels like an excursion :-
1
Came last Saturday on 24th Sep 2016 for dinner with my in-laws family. They had the credit card promo for a one for one discount. *Lets start with the Negatives1)The restaurant's ambiance is poor / lighting is really dark. A mixture of blue and grey for their theme. Doesn't get u in the mood to eat2)Topping of of food - Took forever....some of the more popular dishes like Sting Ray, Squids or Crayfish... it was empty. After 20 plus minutes of waiting, I spoke to the manager in-charge (tall Chinese gentleman approx 1.8m in height) and all he mentioned was he shall speak to the chef. No apologies at all from him. After waiting for sometime again, the dishes were eventually topped up.3)Service was poor. An understatement actually. We requested for top up of warm water in our glasses. After five mins with waiter coming to our table, we requested again. Again another ten minutes, we requested again. After another ten minutes, our glasses were filled. If topping up warm water can take such a length of time, I am not the least surprised by the slow topping up of food dishes as mentioned in point 2). And let me point out that the restaurant wasn't even full! It was half empty and yet the service was so slow. What a bad reputation to restaurant dining in Singapore. The dining experience in town is way better at almost the same price.4)Poor and limited variety of dishes compared to those u can find in town. 5)I had diarrhea later that evening. 6)The restaurant has no toilets which is ok but the Toilet meant for the restaurant on the same floor was really filthy. I'm surprised by this as your hardly find filthy toilets in Changi Airport. *PositivesI have to push myself hard to find one. ok...the one for one discount, I guess. But considering the negatives above, I'll rather spend the equivalent amount of money at somewhere else
3
Pretty typical for a hotel breakfast buffet. A variety of selections, though nowhere near the scale I've seen in similar hotel settings. Good enough if you're a guest. I suspect it is a bit pricey for what you get, however, it was included in my hotel plan.
5
We had a 4 hour wait for a flight out of Changi terminal 3 and went to the Azur coffee shop in the Crowne Plaza hotel that is attached to the terminal. What a great little find.Great selection of food from standard club sandwiches right through to Malay, Singaporean and Chinese favourites. The service was excellent and the decor and quiet was a big contrast with the hustle and bustle of the terminal. Highly recommend
4
This is one of the place that offers 1-for-1 promo even for fri & weekend. Food and variety were good.
5
Wonderful service and food. Thank you Belinda and Jesmi for arranging the halal set dinner for my guest. She was thrilled to have so much food prepared for her.
5
The manager Kok Boon made the event very special for my Husband on Father's Day. The food was excellent, the service staff very customer centric and we had a great time as a family.
1
Had a birthday buffet dinner yesterday at this airport hotel. The atmosphere is dark and dull, not much of choice available. We actually left in 1.5 hrs. Really not worth paying so much (sgd 150 ++) for it. It is far more expensive and less choice than we had earlier in MBS (Rice) one month ago
3
$55++ for a buffet that's worth probably $30. Spread is not big. Place is a little cramp. Due to their promotion now; 50% discount, the crowd surged up and was full during my visit. They were under-staff and it felt the place was like a war zone. The food spread was pretty mediocre and really feels like it is worth $30. The only dish worth mentioning is their bake oyster which was always the first to empty once it was out. I would suggest u can go try other restaurants in Changi Airport b3 for more varieties and save your money.
3
Taking advantage of the 1 for 1 citibank offer, our whole family of 12 went for the dinner offer despite staying some distance away from the airport. The food were generally reasonable, but the variety seems a bit lacking and were mainly chicken. In the end, the only thing that left an impression were the keropok which were crispy and warm. Sashimi and cold prawns were quite fresh that day as well
5
We stayed at Crowns Plaza Changi airport Singapore May 20. We decided to try the Buffett restaurant Azur as it looked busy and had many different food types at stations throughout the restaurant. The food selection was super and very multicultural. We tried many different dishes but the most outstanding dish and it was exceptional and made to order " Fresh oyster risotto" . It was sublime. Big plump oysters devinley creamy but yet not too rich.It was soooo good! The wait staff were lovely .Try this restaurant it's super.
4
Fantastic breakfast and lunch buffet, good quality, great variety and very good a service all with a reasonable price tag given the location. I'm glad that we booked the breakfast when we booked our room, otherwise it would have been expensive. It's a great way to set you up for the days adventures
5
Azur offers both Western and Asian breakfasts. I sampled and Western breakfast. Nothing to say: everything was of a very high quality. I particularly enjoyed the Bircher and the fruit, plus the breakfast pastries. All I can say is arrive with an appetite, and take your time
3
 The Azur buffet restaurant appeared to offer good value the spread is good having lamb chops, pasta, salmon, chick pea salad, quesidillas, pork ribs, seafood ragout, black truffle mash, and many more. Loved trying them all. and 3 cheers to the staff for they are war
4
Went for the breakfast buffet lots of varieties such as western and local food. Delicious food and very attentive services from the staff.
4
Had breakfast here and it was very good. Great selection and good prompt service - just what you want at an airport hotel when you are working to a schedule around flights.
4
Superior buffet for all meals, with menu options available. Wide selection of multi-ethnic foods; Asian and SE Asian the best options; Western dishes just so-so.
4
If you run out of time before catching your flight.
This restaurant is ideally located in Terminal 3 and walking distance from 1
5
So many choices at this buffet. Eggs to order, fish dishes, Indian dishes, yogurt and fresh fruit, Brie and blue cheeses, cured me deli meats, endless breads and sautéed local vegetables. Coffee is also very good here
5
Lots of choices: mussels, shrimp, lamb chops, pasta, salmon, chick pea salad, quesidillas, pork ribs, seafood ragout, black truffle mash, and many more. Loved trying them all. Desserts were also great!
4
Offers buffet and a la carte at reasonable (for changi airport) rates. Staff were attentive and polite. Range of local dishes was limited a la carte but much more extensive on the buffet. Wine is vey expensive but that's true in a lot of places.Overall a good experience
3
Stayed at the Crowns and had dinner and breakfast here.Service was good and the staff were friendly. For Dinner ordered off the menu as I was after something quick and easy. They have a buffet but I was in a hurry and not that hungry. Ended up ordering a pizza, which came quickly and was delicious. The menu is fairly limited.For breakfast had the buffet, good selection and mostly delicious. They could work on the coffee not the worst I have had but a long way off the best..Overall served its purpose
3
Singapore is an increasingly expensive place to live/eat and this is particularly the case for visitors. The Crowne Plaza is no exception - Â£32 for two Singapore Slings, served without a smile. The Azur buffet restaurant appeared to offer good value at 60sd inc taxes but in this world you get what you pay for. It consisted of endless offerings of mediocrity, displayed in an unappetising manner - no wonder it is only rated 3.5 by TripAdvisor
4
I had breakfast at Azur when I stayed at Crowne Plaza for two days. They serve the usual continental and Asian food for breakfast with a live counter. My selection was small being a vegetarian but I enjoyed both my meals there. Staff is distant yet helpful.
5
By far the most amazing restaurant. Very kid friendly. The staff went above and beyond. The food was incredible, specially the sushi, oysters and the to die for dessert table...
2
Buffet selection poor, taste is mediocre. Har Gow skin sticks to bamboo steamer basket, fried rice is bland. Pratha is soggy, porridge is bland, pancakes are tasteless and dry. Would not pay to eat here again.
4
The service was excellent and the food was enjoyable. The location is very convenient with easy access to the airport.
5
Incredible buffet... with exceptionally well prepared Asian and western foods. Met the head chef who was very kind to explain some of the Asian foods to me. Highly recommended. Looking forward to going back.

Great food, in a fantastic location in the airport. The club sandwich was very good and a lovely glass of house red to go with it!

Excellent food...good menu and very good preparations. Personalised attention by Chef adds feathers to the hat

Ate here on stop over on the way to New Zealand. Food not bad - mostly aimed at the US or Chinese traveller as you would expect. Clean and spacious.

It is nicely fitted out and the service was fine and friendly but the food offering was fairly average and somewhat limited on the a la carte menu. This places also offer a buffet so that is an option. There is nothing much else around so if at the airport this is i

At S$55++ per head, I am able to treat my 3 teenage children for a Saturday buffet dinner without breaking the bank because they don't qualify for Child rate at buffet restaurants anymore. So it's good money saving for a family of 5.The spread is reasonable for the price. I like the oysters. They are larger than those served at other buffet restaurants of similar class. The mussels at the cold station were not so fresh unfortunately. The flower crabs were nice. But I expect the gills removed before the crabs were cooked. It impressed on us that the chef is either lazy or not being thoughtful enough. It kind of disgust me when I had to remove the gills (some broke and the liquid spilled) and having to handle the meats with the same fingers/tool.The fish maw soup with crab meat was delicious. The roast meats were done right. Salmon sashimi was fresh. The spread of dessert was fantastic. I like the Yam ice-cream.One thing I don't like is the way they arrange the tables for a group of 5, in particular when the restaurant is not packed at all. I was made the head of the table (i.e. I sat at the side of the last table). I would have preferred combining 3 of the small tables than 2. It was so squeezy to share the space with the diner on my left and right. Making the diners uncomfortable throughout the meal is a no-no. For this, I give a 2/5 for customer service.I will dine here again with my family. It's offers good value for money. We enjoyed 20% discount as the restaurant has a credit card promo

We had the most enjoyable meal, we chose the buffet tonight so that we could try a variety of dishes and try we did. The seafood was so fresh and succulent, no matter how fussy one might be there was something there for every tastebud. Both hot and cold dishes were available with delicious bread and crackers also on offer. The service was exemplary. We had breakfast here as well because we stayed at the Crowne plaza overnight to break our flight to Paris, breakfast was also buffet style and had every inclusion, we would have absolutely no hesitation in coming back here again and rank this up there with one of the best
3
The buffet spread is not much of variety and there is not wide selection of dessert except diner can savour 1960's goodies at a corner.Ambience is ok except it is quite dark inside.With sg50 promotion going on is worth the price.The service is good whereby the staff change the finger bowl very often compared to other restaurant.They are attentive especially Damien and suhaila.Another point is that the chilli crab is not authentic singapore flavour
2
Poor meat choices for lunch buffet. It was very limited! Disappointing when the cost is about $55SGD per person.Breakfast is OK, but i think they need a fresh juice machine to you can make freshly squeezed juices yourself, this would be worthwhile!Dessert during lunch time was good, plenty of options, but more meat needs to be provided, some more fresh carvery options
3
Buffet dinner: oysters were huge and somewhat fresh, but the rest of the food were not fantastic. The chilli crab was cut into such small pieces that there was hardly any flesh, and did not taste fresh. I would give it a 40/100 compared to other hotel buffets.Buffet breakfast: good variety and taste, much better than dinner. I would give it a 70/100. Phew

Azur offers a buffet dinner for $SD39 plus GST and service charge, with a variety of different dishes, both Asian and Western and is open to non residents. There were a number of chicken dishes including soup, but the problem is the way the meat is butchered, meaning that even in a soup dish, there are often many tiny bones to negotiate.. This also applied to the chilli slipper lobster which I declined realising that this would also contain a large amount of shell. Remarkably fresh whole crayfish, mussels and even American oysters were on offer, which apparently are flown in daily. On enquiring about the ingredients of an intriguing mix of items in little bowls, a member of staff told us it was a Singapore dish called Rojak. This consists of a variety of raw fruit, vegetables and nuts, all mixed up with a sweet sour and spicy sauce and was extremely tasty. We later learned that it is popular throughout South East Asia and this street food can be found at many hawker stalls. The recipe is not written in stone, and is very flexible dependent on ingredients available at the time.There was a wide selection of desserts, which surprisingly included bread and butter pudding with crème anglaise to accompany it. Also on offer, was a bowl of M&M's and three different coloured marshmallows, as well as individual fresh fruit tarts, and several plates of gateaux. Finally there was also a variety of different cheeses
4
Given Singapore's foodie reputation, its hotel breakfast spreads are often elaborate and Azur doesn't disappoint, be it eggs, breads, Indian or Asian choices. Service is attentive and the food fresh and filling
4
The buffet was a mixed bag of different national foods. Tried some local beer, was very good. Dessert bar looked good with ice cream but had to pass since being diabetic

The only buffet in the entire airport (excluding airline lounges)! Situated in the prestigious Crowne Plaza Changi Airport Hotel, Azur provides a comfortable dining area though a little dark. Azur's maitre'd was not very welcoming but the waiters and waitresses made up for that with their thoughtful service. i.e They replaced your used cutlery immediately and provided "lemon water" and utensils for cracking the shells of crabs.The variety of food on the buffet line was pretty average. It's an international buffet but not much of choices... The quality of their food was slightly above average... with the sushi being pretty stale (seemed to be overnight).Azur's buffet dinner is slightly pricey for the standard that they provide and I would not it recommend unless you're a hotel guest and want to have a buffet without having to travel to the city
2
Went there with a bunch of friends, food are way below average for the amount paid. Staff was unfriendly and unreasonable. If you have a choice, explore Singapore and eat better food. Eat only for last resort if everything else is closed.
3
Dinner buffet was really good, delicious seafood. Heaps of lobster, prawns, oysters, sashimi etcBreakfast was ok. No bacon though! Why does one religion have to dictate what everyone else can't eat???!!I would guess that 90% of patronage at this hotel wouldn't be Muslim from looking around on the few times I have been here
4
Visited last Friday. I booked on line for the buffet to celebrate mu hubby birthday.Good service, with fresh seafood.the Lobster pincer served later near 9pm, I was already very full . Not sure why it din serve earlier... else food and ambience are perfect, The small slice of round birthday cake was very pretty. Go on Fri, Sat and Sun for seafood buffet :
4
Better selection of vegetarian options as compared to some other hotel restaurants. Very fast service, nice ambience as well.
4
Nice dinner with many food choices and the food taste good. Big juicy raw oyster, prawn, crayfish & flower crab are nice. Their chilli crab is comparable to the most popular seafood restaurant.
5
I enjoyed the Lunch Buffet - everything from fresh oysters and chilnese style chicken, to meatloaf and eggs, as well as nice choice of salad, fruit and desert. Waiters and waitresses were all attentive.
5
Decided to go to the weekend brunch buffet while staying at the hotel on transit. Great tasting food and the seafood spread was excellent.
4
I only sampled the breakfast buffet here and they had quite a few choices of both Singaporean and Western dishes.
4
A 1am arrival made sense to stay at the Crowne Plaza. Went for breakfast as it was included. I was pleasantly surprised. The Crowne plazas are always decent. The ratings on yelp were good and bad. I thought it was very good for a hotel buffet. Lots of Asian and American choices. I ate only Asian and tried a little of everything. I would eat there again on next visit.
4
Satay and soup were worth the visit some of the other offerings left a little to be desiredBack the next day for a breakfast brunch there was a wide variety of offerings from Indian Asian and Western. Although the food was okay it did have a bit of a shelflife issue All in all it was highly preferable to what was served on the airlin
3
We enjoyed an evening of fine dining at the Azur. They serve breakfast, brunch, lunch, and dinner. We enjoyed the buffet that has a great variety of food. Here we enjoyed Western as well as Asian delights. The staff was particular helpful with the small boy we had along who needed a high chair and some special food. I good place to dine

The highlight of the yuletide buffet dinner is none other than the Festive Baked Turkey with Angelica Root, a unique creation by Chef Andrew who likes to infuse an oriental touch to Western cuisine and vice versa. Rubbed with Angelica Root powder, this massive 5-kg turkey is probably the most nourishing version I've ever had. Cross pollinated with ingredients such as sweet corns, preserved Mei Cai and Chinese blood sausage, this golden fat bird tastes even more marvelous than many classic roasts here. Moist, succulent and not overly seasoned, the white meat is enlivened with sweet cranberry-orange marmalade sauce. Fusion cooking here never quite lapsed into outlandishness as the Sweet Potato Marshmallow Gratin proved another experimental success. I thought this serves as an ideal pre-dessert, dessert or even a warm starter for the buffet. Full review and pics visit blog under user's profil

Quality of food was good. They had a good international selection. Unfortunately the night I was there it was slammed with customers. Service was a little slow but the staff really tried to cope with it all. They did a good job and did not drop the quality of the meal.
5
Lovely meal with the kids after the flight from Sydney. Went a la carte. Kids loved it. To be honest, I can barely remember what we all had as we arrived late, but the plates were cleared, staff were great.
3
Food variety was quite limited and the food didn't taste very good (from local's perspective). If not for the promotional price, I wouldn't have tried the breakfast.
5
Superb service, maitre-D was spot on and very efficient. Good prices, fabulous choice with large buffet and extensive menu. Service was some of the best around.
5
We stayed at the Crown Plaza Hotel and decided to try their seafood buffet. It was excellent as was the rest of their many items on the buffet from soup, salads, seafood to desserts. Excellent staff.
3
Breakfast feast was excellent only the service kinda plain. They like ask me to settle my bills while i was eating. But Dinner was excellent, seafood was my main attraction
5
Amazing food. The appetizers I had were spectacular. Best Long Island tea I've had, I think. A little pricey, but worth it! Yum!
3
We were in the Crown Plaza Hotel for an overnight between flights on a two month trip. We decided to avoid the city hassle and dine here. The glass of complimentary wine was a nice touch. We ordered Caesar salads with chicken, a mushroom soup and wonton soup. All fine, but nothing special. Great service
5
There is nothing not to like about the breakfast buffet at Azur at the Crowne Plaza. An enormous selection of dishes from western, chinese and indian, with eggs cooked anyway you like, french pastries and fruit. Great value can be had if you combine the breakfast buffet with an accommodation package. Staff were very friendly
2
I had great memories at Azur restaurant as the last time I was there 3 years ago, it was during an anniversary celebration with my husband. However, when I returned there last weekend, the selection of the food since to have dwindled since. I remembered there used to be a "live" pasta section but then it has since been removed. The pasta serving is already cooked and placed at one of the regular buffet stations. The pasta was hard, and lamb stew was terrible, the sushi variety was cheap! When I asked the chef (I think a foreigner) if there was any tuna sushi available, he couldn't even understand me and had to ask a local chef what I had said. For the amount I paid, I would never return there again
2
I booked a table after reading the nice review here, especially on the snow crab legs, bread pudding, lobster bisque!When I arrive, none of these were on the table, even though I confirm them when I made the table reservation!I asked the waiter why they are not served but he can't answer them, just saying not today.I paid $55 +++ weekend rate on a Friday and none of the popular dish were served?The rest of the food were really so so and most of the dishes were tasteless and bland!Saving grace was the big juicy oysters, fresh and nice.The lobsters which are just crayfish, and clams and scallop were totally tasteless.Roast steak plain, Risotto was acceptable chilli crabs were just too sweet. The baked salmon were bland and tasteless as well, and really nothing much to select.Japanese counter serving some sushi, sashimi and tempura are ok nothing great.For the amount I paid, $130 for 2, it is consider not worthy!I had better buffet elsewhere!I won't be going back any time soon
5
The food and the variety of the food was excellent. The restaurant is in a great location in the hotel and the hours of operation are designed to serve. The restaurant opens at 4am and closes at 10:30pm.
4
Had lunch with great variety from baked duck , chicken , had frog legs , fish , squild , even vegetarian n vegan food was available .
4
Enjoyed the breakfast buffet here while staying at the hotel. Plenty of choice to set you up for a flight!
2
Good ambience and pleasant staff but the food was a disappointment as the food was tasteless and expensive. Perhaps the sumptious Sunday buffet was better but I would avoid the a la carte in the future.
4
We dined at this fantastic buffet restaurant that caters for all tastes. European fine dining, Asian, Far Eastern, Fusion: after all this is Singapore.The range of dishes on offer was comprehensive, beautifully prepared and displayed. The room was spotless. Kids are welcome.The dessert buffet was something to behold: I've never had a bread and butter pudding like this, to name but one of the FOUR desserts that I just HAD to sample!The chefs were helpful and polite and the floor staff were prompt in keeping the table cleared when we returned to the buffet for another tasting.All told, a great experience: arrive hungry, depart replete

Had a buffet breakfast here with my family while staying at the hotel. There was a decent variety of different cuisines to suit various pallets. Everything was ok,but nothing was great. Coffee was pretty ordinary, but as expected for this part of the world. We enjoyed our breakfast though and would probably come here again due to the good service

The weekend I was at the hotel, Azur was doing a buffet of Singaporean Hawker food specialities for lunch and dinner, so although I only had 3 meals in Singapore, a place I consider heaven on earth for eating, I decided to give one of them to that buffet, and I'm glad I did. It was an incredible spread, and everything I had was really tasty. There were Chinese, Indian, Malay and Nonya specialities, as well as a Western sea food spread - I guess that was there for the less adventurous eaters. The dessert table was full of amazing things, both Western and Singaporean. I greatly enjoyed tasting a bit of everything - the only problem was that by the time I had figured out my favorites, I was too full to go back and eat more of them. I don't know that I would be interested in this restaurant under normal circumstances - I don't really eat enough to justify a buffet, and if you don't do the buffet I think it's just an ordinary hotel restaurant - but for a special buffet with a good theme, it would be worth it just to get to try so many different things

For full review, visit my blog at ms-skinnyfatI had the opportunity to check out Azur at Crowne Plaza and their latest offering of premium buffet dinners. The award-winning restaurant will be launching its first edition of the series, Feast of the Seven Seas, this July over a limited period of two weekends from 19 - 21 July as well as 26 - 28 July.Diners can have their pick of seafood and shellfish: Boston Lobsters, Steamed Blue Crabs, Tasmanian Crayfish, New Zealand Green Mussels, Freshly Shucked Fines de Claires Oysters, Jumbo Bay Clams and Poached Tiger Prawns. I absolutely loved the pearly juicy oysters and sweet and succulent tiger prawns.The Lobster Bisque with Tarragon Chantilly Cream with Herb GougÃ¨res was rich and creamy without being heavy. It may be a tad salty but i liked the robustness in the flavors. The slipper lobster and the stir fried bamboo clams are of the Singaporean zi char standard. The chili sauce of the bamboo clams is akin to the chili crab sauce but i found the bamboo clams too fishy for my liking. The sashimi slices were really huge unlike some hotel buffets that provide pitiful pieces. I liked that the sashimi weren't sliced in large batches to ensure freshness of the fish. From the carving station, the Baked Whole Salmon with Seafood, Aromatic Spices, Coconut & Lemongrass Espuma is something that you should not miss. This dish is Thai inspired and i loved how the scallop and salmon were fresh and juicy. There are many other dishes on the buffet line like the award-winning cheeses from New Zealand, appetizing starters, freshly baked selection of bread and sinfully decadent mini shooters and cakes at the dessert bar. Remember to save space for the Bread Pudding for it's one of my favorites.For the price of $88 per adult, i felt that the price is not worth it. The variety is not the most extensive and the taste wasn't mind blowing
1
The food layout looked great, but it was not fresh. The table waiter we had was horrible. He interupted us continously for stupid things even after I asked him to stand back unless we requested service. I think he knew he was pissing us off, but he kept at it anyway. Finally, it is way overpriced for what it is. I would go anywhere else but here

Went to Azur Restaurant for the Easter brunch buffet. While the service was pretty good and efficient, the food was really very average. There was generally a sufficient variety of food, the taste and quality was just okay. Was not really that tasty. Thought the Satay Panggamg could have been better marinated. Other food items were also fairly bland, other than the Nonya Laksa which was pretty okay. Won't be back anytime soon as the only bright spark was the good service. Many better places in Singapore for a good Sunday brunch.
5
Go For the Buffet!! great place to hang out and catch for a drink or snacks before you catch up your flight back home!!
4
I chose to eat A La Carte as I did no feel like having a big meal - had the won ton and noodle soup. The meal was great - and surprisingly given the location of being a captive audience surprisingly good value.
5
We soon became on first name terms with Elan, Krizzy and the girl with an Irish grandfather.!!!
3
dinner buffet is extensive but food quality is mediocre and generally bland. would prefer some more western type desserts. not a good vaue for the price. did not try a la carte items- maybe a better option?
4
I usually do not like buffet restaurants but the Azur is definitely an exception. With lobster, crab, oysters, and a variety of gourmet food items, this buffet is like no other even at a price of SGD88++!
4
This reastaurant opens throughout the day but we only tried it for breakfast, which was very good with a lot of variety in the buffet.

The restaurant is located at Crowne Plaza Hotel on Airport Boulevard and there is a connection bridge between Changi Airport Terminal 3 and the hotel.Good place for locals and hungry tourists who have a few hours to kill but do not want to venture out into Singapore City.It has a classy ambience and the quality of food is generally fresh and good. A place for not only couples but also family. If you are celebrating birthdays, remember to call 3 working days ahead and they will give a complimentary birthday cake (plus the staff of the restaurant will sing a birthday song for you). The serving staff and chef are friendly, helpful and attentive. The chef are quick to replenish the food.The cuisines available range from Japanese, Chinese, Western, Indian to local. The sashimi selection - although there are only 4 types (Salmon, Tuna, Octopus and Swordfish), it is good enough for me and their cuts are generally good. Their oysters are fresh and succulent and there a variety of conditions like vingeratte, tobasco sauce, etc that you can choose to go with your oyster. Those who love spider crab, like myself, will definitely find this buffet worth every cent. Also, the black pepper crab is a must-try. Their roast beef is tender yet moist and their soup of the day are never disappointing.Their desserts are in small portion, hence it is good after a hearty meal. Especially good is their bread and pudding (served at the right warm temperature) and it goes very well with the vanilla custard cream

After seeing solid reviews of this place my wife and I were excited to try something better than standard airport fair while having a long layover in Singapore. We were impressed with the appearance of the place; quite upscale it seemed. We were also greeted by a very friendly staff. That was about all that was good though. My wife's fries were cold and limp, while her club sandwich was made with what tasted to be stale bread. The bacon that came on the sandwich was only on one of the four sections. And she had the better of our meals. My ham and cheese sandwich was virtually not edible. It was actually cold in the middle. The cheese was disgusting (it made Kraft American seem like Brie), the ham was processed and unpleasant, and it appeared to have been made with lard instead of butter (I cannot be sure of that, but it tasted as such). On top of it, despite there being few customers, service was brutally slow. To add insult to injury, our modest meal with two glasses of wine and a soda cost over $50. Granted, the buffet did look good, but at S$55 neither of us felt hungry enough to justify it. That could have been a mistake
4
Had breakfast at Azur. The spread was definitely good, but not the best that I've seen at Singapore. The spread at Marina Mandarin has more variety and also the one at the Carlton. However, there's enough to fill ones tummy. The service is impeccable and the ambience is also good, though a little on the darker side. Overall, a good place with great service
4
I went to Azur for dinner. Being a vegetarian, I asked the hotel staff before asking for a table. They were very glad to help with options. Their Mushroom burger with fries was quite good and well made. The service was nice as well. I went the next morning was breakfast and though the options were OK, the staff service was the difference maker. Good in case you have no other choice
