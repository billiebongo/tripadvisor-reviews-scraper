Quiet place but walking distance from the noisy buzz.
Seafood was very fresh and good.
Big mussels!!!!

Good place to chill, pricing was reasonable (no GST or service charge) with a couple of interesting (albeit limited) beer selection. Be prepared to dine outdoors as there's limited air conditioned space

Interesting food items with craft beers. Air-conditioned seating area is limited though. We sat outdoors in the evening so it was still okie.

Barley salad with grill fish is served different from the picture. The southern fried chicken is ordinary chicken and sauce goes with it is not matching.

The food was served quickly and was really nice. The amount was perfect given that I don't eat a full portion. :) loved the atmosphere!

Noticed this place as I was walking to my hotel down Waterloo Road from Bras Basah station. Checked the reviews on here and thought I'd give it a go, with the mussels being my choice if available.As mentioned by previous correspondents, the majority of tables are outside but there are fans to keep the customers cool.The menu is on a blackboard and I was disappointed to find that mussels weren't on it. However, they managed to rustle up some for me and they were very good, in a lemon flavoured broth with spaghetti. I had a bottle of craft beer to drink and the bill came to 30 Singapore dollars, which is quite cheap in this expensive city.Service was a little slow as there was one person cooking and the other serving, so I gave dessert a miss

First time eating here but will return to try more. My friend had the southern deep fried chicken and I had the kimchi fries with grilled steak. Friend enjoyed her chicken though the garlic was a little strong for her. I didn't like my fries soggy so didn't expect to enjoy the kimchi fries. The spicy, tangy taste went well with the grilled steak. Nice twist. Next time I want to try the mussels.

If you blink, you might miss it! Paper Crane is nestled in the grounds of SCWO. Dress comfortably, as most of the seats here are outdoors - I think only 3 seats in the air-conditioned space next to the cashier.Kimchi Fries with Grilled Steak in Cilantro Mayo ($15 nett)If you're looking for flaming hot kimchi, please adjust your expectations. The kimchi wasn't spicy to me- but added a good refreshing sourness with the thick cut fries. Wish there were more kimchi though because I ran out quite quickly & was left with plain fries.Grilled steak was perfectly done, in bite-sized slices. Wish there were more in quantity but for the price, I am not complaining.Cilantro Mayo is quite something- a good sauce with either the fries or steak or BOTH Spaghetti with Pan Fried Sea Bass in Brown Butter & Onions ($18 nett)Perfectly cooked sea bass chunks, onions & garlic cloves browned just right, & cherry tomatoes that add enough acidity to the dish. I think some might consider this bland, but it was just right for me.Spaghetti in Pesto ($10 nett)This was alright, with some mushrooms here & there. It's great that it is wallet-friendly, but lacks the oomph I'd look for in a good pesto pasta

Such a gem of a food joint that strongly deserved more that what it is. 4 schoolmates gather for a reunion and CNY lunch and what a present surprise. We ordered 2 starters consisting of local green mussels in cooked in salt and garlic and a cold spicy soba. The local green mussels are so fresh and plum and 2 plates for 4 of us was not sufficient!! The spicy soba was very appetizing and truly open up our appetite Next was a sea bass cooked with a sweet and slightly spicy sauce served with toasted baguette. Again, it was cooked just nice and 4 of us did not have problem finishing till the plate was wiped cleaned with the baguette.The filler dish was chickpeas in a tomatoes puree. By then, we were almost full but nevertheless, we tucked it because the peas was soft and not dry and blended well with the tomatoes sauces.Sweet was an apple strudel like pastry. It is average because the corners was burnt but the fillings of apples was good. Good hideaway and not crowded and it was like having a meal with friends at home at the old buildings along Waterloo Street.Strongly recommended for good food, reasonable price and quiet ambience

Seriously a hidden gem in the Bugis area. Well-balanced in term of varieties of food, buttermilk chicken is fantastic and their fish and chip, I would say its different to the typical British fish and chips but a south-east Asian style fish and chips, which is excellent. Overall I would rate it as a 8/10 the only thing need to be improve is the 'presentation' of the food when it is being served. Provided that nowadays ppl used to take photos before start eating, food plating can be a very good way for marketing given that the location of the restaurant is not easy-accessible.
