Enjoyable stay at the Landing Point. Only had beverages, although the afternoon tea set looked rather tempting.

Simply love the ambience of the Landing Point. The best place to have a drink and watch sunset and welcome the night. Quite a good variety of finger food. Great service. Pick a table by the window.

The perfect sundown soiree with artisanal cocktails and panoramic views of Marina Bay. The majestic 13m bar along the elegant indoor promenade paved with marble mosaic and gold hues makes this a perfect setting for tete-a-tete.

Suggested as one of the best places for high-tea. The view is great, the service impeccable, the snacks well thought through. Overall - a great experience especially on the next day after Chinese New Year when so many places were closed.

I came to this hotel for tea time, all tables were empty, and one of the staff told me that everything is booked and that I can have tea time outside in the hot sun, thats not fair because everything was empty!( In both cafe in the lobby)Thats not a way to treat a customer who wants to pay! Last year I came too, and they accept me right away. I can understand that all tables are reserved, but i came 45 min before closing tea time, and everything was empty. After this not pleasent situation I came to Fairmont hotel at Anti Dote to have tea time, and of course they accept me even if their all tables were really full

It’s so beautiful here the lovely inside so colonial and beautifully decorated with the pianist too. We ended up sitting outside on the terrace which was lovely. Comfy seating great views of marina bay sands and the water. Great menu for afternoon tea and fabulous cocktails in fact the No 10 which was gin based was divine and loved the presentation with a small glass with pineapple and cookie. Fabulous venue and excellent service in a beautiful hotel.

I think it should be reasonable to expect that when you cough up S$88 for a woman and an 8-year old to have high tea together, that a tray of (pre-made) sandwiches and pastries, with 2 drinks, should not take 20 minutes to show up.Especially when there is a time limit of one hour to finish this high tea, because the restaurant wants to clear the place out for the next seating. This was my daughter's very first high tea. Fortunately for her, she had nothing to compare it to. So she thought it was great! Unfortunately for me, it was not my first high tea. I've paid the about same amount for high tea at The Claridge's in London. And THAT is the gold standard.The food and drinks are average. Which is to say, I did not particularly enjoy the taste or the texture, but I also did not get food poisoning.The bill came very promptly, unrequested, exactly one hour after we were seated. And although this has nothing to do with the restaurant, none of the flushing systems in the toilet of this 5 star hotel was working at the time of our visit

It is my first time here booked for 4 pax high tea for sister’s birthday requested for window sitting and we got the best window sitting with the perfect view of mbs. Food was good we love the tortilla duck rolls, smoke salmon sandwich, lemon tart and turkey bagel with a selection of TWG tea refillable. Staff was very welcoming I did not mention it was a birthday event but staff was very attentive to bring a cake and sing a birthday song probably saw us came by with a balloon. Very classy place! We had a great time here and would come back again!
5
The english high tea was fantastic.BUT make sur when you book at the fullerton that you are booking at the fullerton and not the fullerton bay hotel.the fullerton hotel is the grand hotel and the fullerton bay hotel is on the wharf and a newer type building
4
Just wanted a quick snack. Ordered Waygu Burger and a Spicy Chicken dish.Both took some time to arrive but we were in no hurry. Food was perfectly adequate and what was expected.Little irritations. No condiments offered and when requested and arrived were empty!Tonic water was draft not canned or bottled and was flat.Table and sofa/chairs are more suitable to having a drink than a proper meal
5
Lovely view of the Singapore river. Great food though abit limited on the choices. Excellent service. Would love to visit again
5
Very good service, beyond expectation. Got a very good seat too. However as we went on a Christmas Eve, the menu is slightly different and some desserts were too sweet...
4
Great place for catching up with friends over high tea as the ambience is nice and cozy. Drinks are refillable which is a plus.
4
Good high tea experience. They have a small buffet table for hot foods, and they bring you re-fillable tiered stand of both savoury and desserts. Good mix of local foods too. Try to get one of the large lounge/couches!

Everybody loves The Landing Point for high tea. They’re also an excellent (but pricey) option for a very good cocktail. The views across Marina Bay are postcard-stunning and indoor and alfresco take full advantage of that. It’s secluded from the madness of tourists taking photos, so it’s a lovely spot to relax with friends.One thing they don’t do very well is their a-la-carte. It’s an uninspiring menu, and the dishes we had (a spaghetti carbonara, lamb curry and prawn and chorizo starter) were not executed with any flair. They weren’t bad, they were just generic cafe quality where we were hoping the kitchen might be doing more interesting things.The experience was just a mismatch in expectations. If you’re looking for chefs doing interesting things then try some of the other restaurants nearby. If you are looking for a good cocktail, a great view or high tea with friends then The Landing Point is certainly worth considering

If you are looking for an Afternoon Tea that stretches its operating time till 10.30pm, The Landing Point's Evening Tea sure fits the bill. An array of TWG teas and gourmet/artisan coffees is available for free flow at their disposal. There is soft drinks and juice too just in case you are not a fan of strong caffeine.Food is mediocre at its best. Nothing fancy and to wow at. Was expecting something special since it is based on the festive theme of Christmas. All i can recall that excite my otherwise mundane appetite upon seeing the arrival of our 3-tier towered canapes, pastries and sweet bites resting neatly on some China was the kuih pie tee-like-pulled lobster in mayonaise, an underportioned gingerbread creme brulee (probably 15-20ml) on a semi-flat remekin, hazelnut custard puff topped with a distinguish chocolate star to commemorate the festivity and truffle mushroom pastry. The rest were plain forgettable. The mini blackforest log cake/swiss roll is just abysmal. Dry and lacking any flavour, texture or content. Where is the prune/dark cherries and why the lack of cream/mousse? It's like eating plain chocolate chiffon on thinly spread cheap chocolate cream. An anniversary cake makes up for the loss cause. A splendid 200gm chocolate ganache and mousse cake was presented by the same lady that served us well during our arrival (probably their reservations Manager) with well wishes and warm smiles. I have to add that they serves awesome afogato. The vanilla gelato and its well time pressed espresso extract marries well. My verdict: Come here and opt for the Evening Tea if you just want to lay back and wind down after an early dinner elsewhere. Otherwise, you'll find better choice from their ala carte menu if you are here to fill your tummy happy. But my take is, do more research on other places shall you want to impress that someone who especially have sweet tooth and craves for chocolates. And since I came here with my kids, they were totally bored to the bone and the only part that excites them was the live acoustic piano tune of Let It Go fills the air at one particular time during the gig.Service was attentive and prompt. They did put the effort to converse although at times they seemed a tad nervous
4
As expected, very lovely place to chillax. Very delicious coffee and interesting tea selection. The 3 tier afternoon tea set can be replenished. The small buffet line are mainly the same items on the tier with a couple of extras - penne with tomato sauce, spring roll and sausage puff. Love the cheese on the cracker and duck sandwich! Food is nice. Highly recommended for chillax and chit chat sessions. However, may not meet expectation if one is looking for food indulgence.

While the Esplanade itself may have plenty of spots for an after theatre night cap, I prefer to drive or walk the distance to The Landing Point at the Fullerton Bay Hotel. With a table by the floor to ceiling windows, you get the best views overlooking the waters towards the Marina Bay Sands.At that time of the night, you are also blessed with posh tranquility... perfect to wind down for the night with plenty of espresso left in your cup of affogato after doing justice to the generous scoop of not too sweet vanilla ice cream. A perfect pairing to an equally delicious creme brûlée that's topped with fresh succulent strawberries and blackberries... tempting you to round the intimate tete a tete with its offerings of sweet liqueurs

I was excited to visit The Landing Point a second time, and this time around, with business associates from Tokyo. The Landing Point and its team of service staff continued to impress with a high level of service and gorgeous views of the Marina Bay. We had the Ala Carte menu for dinner and then headed out to the alfresco area for drinks afterward. Coincidentally, it was 8 pm, and my guests from Japan got to enjoy the light show from Marina Bay Sands, and it made for some beautiful photo taking opportunities. We also enjoyed having the delicious Singapore Sling and Pimm's Perfume Cup. All in all, it was a fantastic experience once again. I highly recommend this dining location for you to bring your business associates to, especially for whom are visiting Singapore for the first time
4
Food choices are quite limited though. Sweets are limited and taste average. Ambience is great with a fantastic view too
4
Its always very relaxing when having afternoon tea at The Landing Point. Nice food Nice ambience! Always think of Landing point for afternoon tea
5
Been 2 times for High Tea. Good choice of food and teas! Staff is very friendly. Recommend for everyone!
5
First impression was really a wow factor!
Service was top notch!
Food was delicious!
Ambience was great!
And a big FAT THANK YOU for catering to my request from the special birthday arrangements and also the food changes for the afternoon tea set!
5
Glamorous restaurant in which to have a great afternoon tea. The cakes and sandwiches were all excellent particularly the pastries. There are great views of the marina bay sands hotel and the service was attentive but not intrusive they were always on hand to get you more tea or coffee. If you needed more food There was also a buffet area with hot scones and sausage rolls plus spring rolls and more cakes
5
I have booked thru Chope, remarks requesting for a good view sitting as it was a birthday celebration. In midst of enjoying a good pot of Nepoleon tea and some very yummy pastries, the serving team came with a piece of cake and candle, singing happy birthday! It was such thoughtful touch. It made the afternoon extra memorable

1. How could I not love Afternoon tea Experience? Besides, staying in London UK alone for 4 months last year...I have had quite a lot of experience of it. But, coming back to Singapore, I'm glad that I tried and had an amazing afternoon tea experience at the Landing Point in Fullerton Hotel Bay Singapore where I'm a fond of it's classy, sophisticated and luxurious 5-star hotel.2. Fullerton Hotel Bay Singapore is a 7-minute walk from Raffles Place metro station, this elegant waterfront hotel in the Central Business District is 2 km from Marina Bay.3. Upon arrival, I went to their amazing The Landing Point where I had my reservation prior my arrival and warm welcome extended to me by their staff. The English Scones, finger sandwiches, delicate pastries and tempting sweets and their unlimited selection of fine teas and coffees are fantastic! And, the view from the Fullerton Hotel Bay will indeed take your breathe away!4. In my Tray (Afternoon Tea), I tried their nicest finger sandwiches, assorted pastries and sweets!Salted Caramel TartFlavoured MacaroonsPistachio PuffFruit CakePetit Quiche du JourBoston Lobster Cornet a I' OrientalWhite Truffle Egg Mayo SandwichSmoked Salmon Mille Feuille with CaviarMini Prosciutto Ham BagelFrench Cheese, Stone Fruit Terrine on Hazelnut CrackerCucumber Sandwich with Ikura Roe Duck Rilette in Sesame BunChocolate EclairLemon TartOrange MadelineCanele5. Aside from my afternoon tea set tray, there's a buffet section selection with 4-5 menu choices from one dish of pasta, to assorted pastries.6. There is also a man playing the piano which makes it more classy and exquisite to experience the afternoon tea in The Landing Point!7. Fullerton Bay Hotel Singapore is such an amazing hotel and having an afternoon tea experience here will give you an amazing different view of Singapore in more prestige and sophisticated way. So highly recommend especially for those who love to have an Afternoon Tea

The night at Landing Point got off to an excellent start when the service staff greeted me by name upon arrival. This is a nice touch, and both my date and I were very impressed. We went on a Friday evening after work and were pleasantly surprised to find that it was not too crowded. We got a seat right next to the window and got a magnificent view of the Marina Bay and Marina Bay Sands. The ala carte menu was very comprehensive, and there were even all-day breakfast sets served. We moved outside to one of the couches at the alfresco area after dinner and treated ourselves to the light show from Marina Bay Sands, with a glass of Margarita/Singapore Sling in hand. The ambience and setting were perfect for a romantic night. We thoroughly enjoyed our evening at Landing Point and will recommend this dining spot to others

We spent a relaxing afternoon away from the heat having tea at the Landing Point. Make sure to make a reservation. We had a beautiful view across the water to the Marina Bay Sands, and the tea and foods were quite good. The tea is brewed loose leaf, and after your first pot you switch teas and try another. The truffle egg salad sandwiches were very good, and the scones with clotted cream and jam were delicious. There were many delicacies, but we kept coming back to those. They also gave us a complimentary gift bag of cosmetics
4
Chose The Landing Point for one last Sunday afternoon tea before our baby arrives. My own mistake for not indicating in the booking that I was pregnant, so was allocated a table with high chairs. Still, no big issue and did not require them to move us although they kindly offered. Love the simple yet delicious balance of sweets and savouries - refillable to boot! Experience was made even better by the amazing piano and singing repertoire of classic ballads. Service was very friendly throughout, although some beverage and refill orders required several reminders before they arrive. Will return for the lobster cornets (too tiny, and hard to get a refill - please make them a little bigger!
5
we visited here on a tuesday night for the sundown soiree everything was just perfect from the food to the live singer who was entertaining the guests.The food was wonderful there were both savoury and sweet treats so you get the best of both worlds all are refillable and the staff were happy to do so when they could see the plate empty in fact we had to say no more in the end as we were completely full. included in the price is a cocktail and unlimited tea/coffee and soft drinks good value for such an elegant setting and view over the lit up marina bay hotel.Many thanks to all the staff that made our evening enjoyable
5
It was a casual meetup with my bestie. We had a great time chilling, eating and just enjoying the lovely live music performance. Staff are really polite and kept asking us if we want more food topups. A must come for high tea 😚

Love the high tea!! Service is great!! The staff are friendly and attentive!! Great experience!! Will definitely return!!

We went to afternoon tea at 3pm on a Saturday. We were taking friends who were visiting Singapore. Arrived just before 3pm and were seated. It then took much waving and attempting to attract someones attention to actually order a drink. This took about 15 minutes.There is a buffet and also a tray of sandwiches and cakes are placed on the table.The tray took over half an hour to arrive so we decided to go to the buffet first. At the buffet, two of the first items were not there/ had run out. They ran out of plates and on two visits to the buffet there was no jam for the scones.We had to pay half price for the children - which would have been fine except they received no tray of their own of sandwiches/cakes. They obviously don't drink tea so had to pay extra again for juice.Finally, the table we were seated was barely able to fit all the trays/ plates/ tea cups/ glasses on.General impression was that way too many people were crammed in, with far too few staff serving customers.Was not impressed at all. This was not a 5 star afternoon tea experience and I left feeling embarrassed that we had taken our visitors there.I will not be back. Far too many other much better options in Singapore for afternoon tea
5
Love the seats by the floor to ceiling windows with views of Marina Bay Sands. Food items and beverage can be replenished, uncommon in most afternoon tea locations. Love the lobster coronet . While the variety of items were a little limited , they were of good quality and I was stuffed at the end of it. Sparkling wine option cost was very reasonable.
5
Visited for high tea during a weekday. An informal location with impeccable service. Seating was comfortable and the small treats- both savoury and sweet, were generally well done. Excellent selection of teas. Too bad about the boards partially blocking the view of MBS. The long-haired pianist could do with more practice also. But all in all a delightful and relaxing afternoon. Enjoyed myself
3
Everything is fine with this place except service.This place is under staff and have problem coping with orders. Took us so long to get our orders and also the bill

An old classmate who's been living in Canada for years flew in from Jakarta, Indonesia for only a couple of days and for some strange reason we both felt like having traditional English tea (although we were in Singapore!). We picked The Landing Point for its ambience within the very elegant Fullerton Bay Hotel. We requested to have a quiet corner and proceeded to have a wonderful time laughing away and catching up. We were glad the afternoon tea selection wasn't like the one offered at the Clifford Pier within the same hotel - no local "kueh kuehs" for us! However, given that we had to squeeze this in between our tight schedules, having afternoon tea pastries close to dinner time felt a bit odd (although I know this isn't an uncommon practice even among jet-lagged tourists in London, for they actually book slots to have afternoon tea at night!)
3
Went for a weekend high tea. A very delicious 3 tiered buffet of savory tarts/sandwiches and sweets desserts was served. Food items can be replenished upon request from staff. Good selection of tea (free flow). Fullerton white tea was very fragrant. There is also a buffet section where you can pick up some food items. Staff was very friendly and polite. Despite working under pressure, they never lost their smiles or helpfulness. However, they didn't seem to be coping. The high tea started at 3pm, by 3.35pm there was hardly any food left at the buffet section. We kept on going back with little success! It was not replenished promptly. It could due to large groups (birthday). We sat at the high chairs near the window. While the view was good if you sit near the window, it is also by the bar where they collect used plates/cups etc. so the ambience was not cosy. It was also very close with the next table so there is also little privacy. Thus, while the food is good, am unlikely to go back as it lacks the cosy and relaxing ambience of an English high tea. 
5
Perfect Place. Perfect Food. Perfect Tea Selection. Perfect Service. Live performance on piano was Perfect too but a little too loud...plus the high ceiling , was hard to hear one another in a big group. Thanks to the chefs and staff, we had a wonderful afternoon
4
We try a different venue for high tea every time we visit Singapore, and Landing Point rates very well. The venue and the view makes for a lovely setting. They offer an excellent range of TWG teas. The high tea includes a wide range of savoury and sweet options. I was very (pleasantly) surprised when the staff offered seconds of our favourite treats, which really wasn't necessary as there is a generous amount of food. I particularly recommend the Boston Lobster Cornet and the Truffle Egg Mayo Sandwich.The staff were very attentive and helpful. My top tip: take your time with the food and enjoy the view
5
~between 2-5pm are the off peak hours you'd get a relatively good business discussion going with unfettered service
~not here for the food but tea & coffee + snacks are well served and on the high end :)
5
The food was better than expected, the atmosphere was superb and service was excellent .... I would be happy to go back again !

Briefly: Food- plentiful and delicious View- wonderfulSetting- comfortable and luxurious Staff and service- excellent Overall enjoyment- This was a special afternoon and a wonderful memory. Last week I was lucky enough to experience high tea here with a friend. The whole experience was so lovely. Food was amazing and it was replenished quickly- though there is plenty of food, so some may not need the option of taking extra of their favourite pieces. Such a variety of food in different flavours and all amazingly delicious! Tea was wonderful- it is a tea bag in the pot, but they use TWG tea and it was absolutely wonderful. Despite the heat, I had a refill of my pot. Just lovely. The view across the bay over to Marina Bay Sands is rather interesting and quite relaxing. I'm so glad I had the opportunity to experience this. Aprilyn provided professional, cheerful and warm customer service. Unfortunately I can't remember the names of the other staff. Downsides: We did have to wait (though not long) and we were slightly overcharged for one drink. I mention these just to be completely 'transparent'- neither took away from the wonderful visit
4
Food was good, especially the Choc tart. There are both savoury and sweet treats so you get the best of both world. The The Burger's bread was a bit on the dry side though. Was quite slow in refilling the food
5
Went to The Landing Point with friends. Amazing service by Aileen and also Aprilyn the manager. Top notch service! And great food too. Assets to the company.
3
The environment, atmosphere and services are great, but the food is under value. Therefore, overall averange
3
High tea food items are refillable however only few items are nice. Staff are attentive and will ask if you want to order more drinks.
4
Food was pretty good, but probably not worth its value. Enjoyed the free-flow tea & coffee! Atmosphere and view was nice and service was good
3
food was average (variety and taste could be improved for the price paid) but service and setting was very good (conducive for a relaxed and quiet meal)
4
Had the evening soiree tea set. Able to try different drinks that came with the set. All were good except that the refill was a bit slow, waited quite a while with no food before the next refill would come
5
Relaxing atmosphere with free flow of a selection of tea and scrumptious morsels for afternoon tea. Nice place for chilling with a group of friends.
4
lovely high tea with my mum. loved the fact that it came on the 3 tier stand AND is re-fillable. we loved the lobster tarts the best. the selection of tea was great too.will definitely be back!
1
The serving staff needed no less than 5 reminders to serve our coffee. Twice, they got the orders wrong. The quality of the food during the high tea was also extremely poor
4
Food & service was excellentour needs had been catered forstaff are friendly and approachable.Some are went to an extend of asking if there is anything else nee

My daughters and I enjoyed a lovely afternoon tea at the The Landing Point. I had researched several different locations and settled on The Landing Point based on the location. The ambience was beyond compare. The mood is enhanced by the live piano music playing in the background. We had quite an extensive tea menu to choose from and were able to try as many different teas as we'd like. The food was presented on tiered trays with both savory and sweet options. My favorites were the chocolate tart and lemon tart. The service was a bit lacking. We had to wait quite a while for tea refills. Overall, I would definitely recommend just for the location and ambience. Was one of the highlights of our trip to Singapore.
5
Was there with my gal friend to celebrate her birthday and it was really awesome. Upon arrival, the service staff asked if this is our first time here and started introducing the items on the menu and recommended tea/coffee. The serving for the high tea platter was really generous and the selection was splendid. What's more, the service crew will go around for a refill. Goodness service! Close to the end of the session, the pianist played the Birthday song for my girl friend and the staff came with the complimentary slice of dark chocolate cake which was really nice and rich. The service and high-tea is seriously awesome! Thumbs up! I'll definitely come back again. Great place for celebration, with good view, ambience and servic
5
The Landing Point is located at Fullerton Bay Hotel, in the heart of CBD. From the dining area, one can get a very good view of marina bay sands, sipping tea/coffee and enjoying the afternoon tea set. Items on the tea set are refillable and the tea & coffee is free-flow too. I've earlier informed them that it's my friend's birthday and they gave her a surprise cake together with the live singing of Birthday song. Also wish to highlight that their service is good and definitely a place that I'll recommend to friends
5
Would like to shout out to Emma and Maria who provided A++ service! They're the ones who made our night memorable, we felt welcomed and taken care of from the moment we were greeted at the entrance. The three tiered evening soiree bites were great, especially loved the salmon bagel, lemon tart, open sandwiches. Food was free flow and we were definitely very full at the end of the night.There was a fantastic list of teas and specialty coffees to choose from, completely spoiled for choice and value for money especially with the specialty coffees!!The views of MBS and the bay was absolutely gorgeous too. It was such a memorable night
4
I asked for a seat next to the window to get nice views of the Marina Bay. It was lovely. Pros:- great variety of food- free flow tea and food- interesting range of tea (Silk Water was surprisingly nice!)- quality of food was high- did not have to wait long for high tea platter to arrive- additional small buffet table with scones and sandwiches- nice live piano and singing- 15% Standard Chartered credit card discountCons:- tea was in bags- service was a bit slow after a whil
4
I recently had high tea at The Landing Point with a group of 14 womenThe staff was extremely helpful and accommodating when I made the reservation, they were also very helpful when it came to dealing with dietary restrictions. They were a bit hard to get attention from once we were seated/eating, but it was a crowded day and they were busyThe food was delicious, and there was a little something for everyone. You definitely get your money's worth! Go with an empty stomach and you will leave absolutely stuffed!!The teas were especially goodThe best part, however, was the ambiance and decor! Very elegant, luxurious and relaxin
5
Went on a weekday with a girlfriend. She does not drink alcohol so this is a Great place for evening coffee and tea.
5
Staff are attentive & friendly.
Food items are yummy & refilled efficiently.
A good choices of tea & beverages.
5
Perfect Saturday night dinner with my family....delicious food and cocktails and super attentive staff. Will be back
2
We arrived punctually for our appointment but was only seated 20mins later. Waited another 20mins for the food to come. Food came, was cold, nothing fantastic. The only saving grace was the good service and fabulous tea but I don't think that will make me visit again nor recommend landing point to anyone.
3
Went there yesterday for high tea with my daughter and a group of her friends. Great location and ambience. That's the best part. The trays of food looked very nice and well displayed on the cake stands. Too many sweet dishes. There could have been more savoury dishes with Asian flavours. After all we are in Asia. I was very disappointed with the experience. Won't be going back
5
Booking for 13 people handled smoothly: we had a top position in quiet restaurant so we could hear each other talk, pianist playing quietly nearby. The spread of food was amazing, absolutely beautiful. Loved Magic Moment tea. Would go again any time.
4
We came in around 15 mins ahead of our reservation and it took a while for us to be seated. Loved the comfy couch, quality of teas and afternoon tea snacks. Great thanks to Mr. Mano who made my daughter and nanny's dining experience wonderful!
5
We visited the The Landing point a few times during our stay for cocktails and also afternoon tea, with champagne of course! Each visit we were greeted and served by the most beautiful staff, cocktails and food. The afternoon tea was delicious however we felt guilty leaving some of it as it was far too much food for us.( They also serve you top ups during the sitting which surprised me as it was substantial enough without them.)Beautiful, cozy, luxurious and I want to go back now!
4
The service staff were attentive and impressive, and taste of good is great. Just a minor point that the variety of food seems pretty much alike to my last visit which was 2 years back. Perhaps the restaurant can explore changing the variety from time to time to draw customers to revisit. Other than this, everything else is great. The view and ambience are big plus points :
4
Our lovely waitperson - Emma - was helpful and attentive. We enjoyed the view while sipping on a Chardonnay and nibbling carpaccio
5
Nice environment for hi tea. Food and drinks are great! Good place for gathering and hi tea with friends
5
every now and then we go there for afternoon tea. Live music, Marina Bay Sands hotel view, cozy environment and high quality food make the place special. Added surprise was 20% off when paid by Citi credit card.
4
My 2nd visit to landing point at fullerton Bay. Always love the ambience there and the food is good. Especially love the lobster in the waffle cone! Will visit again!
5
Very relaxed and cozy atmosphere in this bar, especially at weekend night.
On top of the incredibly wonderful view for Marina Bay Sands, you get cool wind from the sea when you go there in right timing in right season.
5
This place has nice food and nice ambience. Free flow of high tea food. The food is nice. Beside free flow of food, the TWG tea is also free flowing! So are the coffees!
3
We had been booked to have afternoon tea at Clifford Pier but at the last minute were told that a private function was being held there so Landing Point was suggested as an alternative for us.Four of us were in Singapore for a family celebration and we were really looking forward to afternoon tea on our last afternoon there. On the surface everything looks good, but the service was "sloppy" and the food although edible was forgettable. Unfortunately, this is not a venue I would return to, nor recommend for their afternoon tea
5
The service is superb. Even though the lounge seems shorthanded, the staffs are trying their best to see to all our request fast, we do not feel "shortchanged" in terms of service. Ambience is good and whole place is cosy and comfortable, though it's fully booked. Food is on the other hand, rather average. Nonetheless, for the refillable part and price paid, it's considered worth it
3
This is really one of the nicest hotels in town, and The Landing Point, in terms of ease and convenience of location, beautiful surrounds and great atmosphere should be getting top marks. The only reason why I stopped short of an additional star is the service - very good when you get it, but I got the feeling they were understaffed that morning, such that I had to look around to find someone to get my table (which was already reserved), get attention to give my orders and then get attention to get my bill. Won't stop me from going there again as there are few places that nice for morning coffees, but hopefully service promptness improves
4
We reached slightly before 3pm and the hostess was happy to seat us first which we appreciated. The view was beautiful and atmosphere was comfortable and quiet. Believe there were some technical issues because they took forever to bring out the scones (sometime after 4pm) and they were cold so they were left in the warmer for abit which didn't seem to help. Thankfully the 3 tiers looked beautiful and tasted great but it took awhile for them to bring around the refill trays and we did not manage to have enough of some items since they never showed up a second time. With regards to the food, there were some hits and misses, some items were soggy, some were cold, some were delicious, and some were a waste of stomach space. =XHowever, the service was good; everyone was polite and smiley. My only grouse would be that we would have appreciated if they had gone table to table to inform us of the delay in food serving. And when we asked about the scones before they finally showed up, one of the hostess said they would be sending them to our table personally. That never happened and my friend had to help herself afterwards. Not a big deal, but still would have preferred a heads up (lol pun unintended) since we kept having to look up whenever a staff walked passed.That being said, 3 of us ordered 9 different types of TWG tea in all since they said we could! I think we enjoyed that part the most haha
5
I visit Landing Point at least twice a month. Both savouries and sweets are good. Refillable too. Wide range of TWG teas available
4
We were staying in this beautiful hotel and enjoyed several meals in this fabulous looking dining room. Menu is limited but we opted for the local dishes which were quite good. The Chicken Rice and the Won Ton Soup were delicious.
4
I enjoy the food and the service at "The Landing Point" the atmosphere is great as well :) Definitely an awesome place to recommend families and friends. Thank you :)
5
My first time there for Afternoon tea. Introduced by friend who has been returning several times a year. Good food and company.

Reservation through Chope app was easy. Happy to get a follow-up call prior to arrival to ensure that all arrangements are made correctly. Got a nice high seat overlooking Marina Bay and the amazing bay skyline. No fuss and no distraction.Price was definitely affordable and worthy. Premium food, service and experience. Frequent refills of both tea and food makes the entire experience truly memorable.Will be back soon

Nice spread-esp the pama, egg mayo truffle s/wich and warm scones, pleasant service staff (under manned so took some time to have their attention). Great place to chill.

Landing Point provide a cost environment for afternoon tea and place for a relaxing afternoon gathering. Staff are friendly as well

The atmosphere is great.. we had an indoor corner table which is the best spot in the restaurant. The service is good but food is ordinar

Warning - we were misleded by the promotionl poster. It turned out nothing like it. Service - An consistent mix of poor, poor service crew at a five star hotel. Only one person served with a genuine smile whilst the rest were too busy to bother. We were unattended to for over 20 mins and suddenly a crew dropped a bowl of commercial fries on our table in a fluster and surried off.Food - Absolute disaster. The promotional poster advertised "An Exquisite Evening Tea" but in reality we were served with the following - • Commercial deep fried fries overdosed with truffle oil in a bowl to distract our lengthy wait. It was and literately left a bad taste. When we finished the snack the tier finally arrives. It goes to show how long we waited for the main course. McDonald's fries with a pinch of salt tasted better. • Tier one - We did not order McDonald's. Commercial chicken nuggets & commercial breaded mashed potated plus some tiring looking spring rolls cooked unevenly with basic local chili sauce... Missing is the promised "breaded calamarie rings in cocktail sauce" promised on the promotion. No one told us they ran out of food. Tier two - An uninspiring collection of dessert which ought to be tier three strictly speaking for high tea tiring order. It was suspiciously leftovers from the Afternoon Tea or somewhere from the pantry, altogether stale and shamed. If the "Blood Orange Arriba Cinnamon Chocolate Mousse" was served at all, it could not be tell by sight nor by taste. The "Equatorial Chocolate Crème Brulee" was AWOL but replaced by two petite dishes of cold sunken mess not right to be called crème brule because the sugar did not caramelised on the top. We were shocked. Tier three - Solid disappointment. I lost faith with the dining experience by now and it was painful to recalled the overly salted combination listed -- smoked salmon & caviar on solid, tasteless crouton, and prosciutto on solid, tasteless crouton. There were 4 basic egg mayo sandwiches but then we reminded ourselves we were not at Subway, but supposed to be at The Fullerton Bay Hotel. Conclusion - It will be semi decent to hear back personally from the Management how on earth did you not only become lazy, and also cheated your customers on your promotional poster with downright fraud. I do noticed there is no fine print of failed to provide as per described, there would be a courtsey of informing customers during order. A representation of dishonesty at one of the country's historical building. Shame on you.

Was there to celebrate my fiance's birthday with a group of friends. Nice atmosphere, not too crowded for a Wednesday night. Would visit agai

Went for a weekday high tea. Good food, pleasant ambience and good service. You will need to reserve in advance if you want a seat overlooking the bay.
5
It was a great view from The Landing Point. Food was awesome too, staffs were attentive and refill our food promptly.
5
A great place to celebrate our wedding anniversary. They even surprise us with a small whole cake to add on to our celebration. What a pleasant surprise. Overall a excellent place with excellent atmosphere with excellent food and service.
5
Good services , nice atmosphere, went there for my best friend hens night, nice sofa seats, one of the lady korean look alike staffs are really nice and helpful.
4
The tea & coffee served was excellent and its refillable high tea sets that accompanied it was incredible...everything from sandwiches to pastries, even the cakes. For $45 a person i left absolutely stuffed.
4
A place with a nice ambience, overlooking at the Marina Bay Sands. A great place to spend the weekend afternoon!

I organized a friend's baby shower and chose Landing Point as the location. It was a great choice, as everyone (from the mum-to-be, to her family and her friends/colleagues) loved the tea! The variety of food served was excellent, and the food itself was delicious. What was even better was that we could ask for seconds if there was any particular item we really enjoyed, and the service staff were more than happy to keep refreshing our tea and food until we couldn't eat anymore! The service is also fantastic - the whole team was extremely helpful in ensuring that my specific requests for the baby shower were met. The concierge even helped to receive a delivery for me as it arrived early on the day of the shower, and I hadn't arrived yet. I would say that for the price we paid, this is probably the most worthwhile and delicious afternoon tea I've been to in Singapore. The food, ambience, and service are all hard to beat. Kudos to the team for a wonderful afternoon and baby shower!

We had their classic 3-tier hi-tea set and the food was really average. The sweets are simply overloaded with sugar without flavour depth or variations. However, the disappointment with the food was not overshadowed by the cozy ambience, stunning view of the bay and excellent service of the staff. Will not return for the food, perhaps just for drinks. It will be nice to have complimentary carpark too as the charges are ridiculously expensive! $16 for 2hr...we were shocked upon our exit

There are 3 places which I like a lot in Fullerton Bay Hotel: Lantern Bar, Clifford Pier and Landing Point. All of them are beautiful and highly recommended for visiting. Definitely every place has its own speciality and the signature thing about Landing Point is the high tea, which starts from 3 pm. During few hours you can enjoy quality tea with a plenty of sweets, which are being renewed by waiters until you are completely full. Setting is very stylish and beautiful! If you've missed the tea, you can order the dishes of western and local cousin, but don't expect too delicious food as it's not a proper restaurant. The place is very beautiful, in the evening it usually has live piano music. You can choose between inside and outside seating. Place is recommended for business or friends meetings!
4
Basically you can have high tea at the Landing Point or the Clifford side. To me both are equally classy and good to chill out. Fullerton Bay Hotel is a classy and beautiful hotel. For $45 ++ you are entitled to the full set of high tea with a beverage. The beverage is refillable, and for the tea time snacks, the staff will walk around refilling for you. There are a wide range of savoury and sweet items for you to chose from, they come in the three tier tray. To speak the truth, the food are fresher when you initially come in ( there are 2 seatings for Sat: 12:30-15:30 and from 15:30 onwards). The menu changes so there is no fix item that is really nice. Basically pay for the good ambience. It is a good place for gathering
4
Cam here after a concert. Ambience was good. food was good. Had the salmon bilini which really was NOT salmon bilini but Salmon pancake. Otherwise the rest of the people enjoyed their food.
5
Excellent place for business discussion. Service was prompt and coffee is good. Location is conducive and very accessible.
5
Loving the afternoon tea offered by the Fullerton Bay Hotel. Love the three tier classy afternoon tea set. Coffee, TWG tea and chocolate is free flow, and all the items are refillable.The food is definitely of good quality and we particularly love the lobster tart, chocolate tart, lemon tart, smoked salmon sandwich , ham roll, and rye biscuit with cream cheese.If you have kids below 6 years old, they eat for free! Yay!!!View is wonderful overlooking Marina Bay Sands and occasionally boat passing by the riverfront. There is also piano performances to add points to the nice ambience! Recommended!
5
A group of us took afternoon tea at The Landing Point to celebrate a birthday. The service was great, and we never had any issues when summoning a waiter. The selection of both sweet and savoury snacks was wonderful, and we loved how these could be topped up whenever we wanted. It was also nice to be able to try as many different teas as we liked, all served in beautiful silver pots. The location and view were the icing on the cake, as was the non-intrusive pianist. We will definitely be going back
5
Selection of food was average but ambience n service was great. With the 1-1 promotion it's worth to try out if one hasnt.
5
Had morning meeting here for business. Asked for a quiet corner and was given a table at a corner with sofa seats. It proved to be quiet enough for business discussion. In fact, its a good change from having meeting within 4 walls in a tiny room. The ambience is nice and classy. It is located right at the entrance of Fullerton bay hotel
3
View was beautiful for a relaxing afternoon catchup with a fellow friend. The staff offered to help me snap a shot with the backdrop and serve up a scone while i was waiting for my friend to arrive. Thats when the exceptional good service ends. My order for drinks on 3 different occasion was left out and required constant reminding throughout. It's such a shame to experience this in a hotel restaurant. The service crew who took my last order for food replenishment dare say that i didn't place any order. How disappointing!Lastly, I had to remind the staffs that i booked under HSBC promotion for their champagne high tea despite indicating it when i called up for reservations previously. Sigh.

-Different variety of choices for those with a sweet tooth-Good view overlooking Marina Bay Sand.-Excellent service, friendly staff who always hold the smile in their face
5
Was there just yesterday afternoon for the 12:30pm seating of afternoon tea. What we liked:- Nice sunny ambiance and picturesque views of Marina Bay. - Great selection of teas. - Presentation, selection and attention to detail of the bites on the 3 tiered tray was top notch. (Most of the items were good but our favorite was the lobster cornets and the smoked salmon mille feuille)- Excellent service from attentive staff on the floor (a big thank you to Angel who kept our tray constantly refilled with our favorites!!) - The scones were really good; warm and slightly moist on the inside matched with the jam and clotted cream. What we didn't really like (small issues lol):- Several of the dessert items were really too sweet most notably the salted caramel/chocolate tart. All in all, we had a really great time at The Landing Point and will most likely recommend your afternoon tea to our friends!!
4
We were at the 1230pm sitting which lasted till 3pm. The second sitting will be from 330pm till 6pm. The lobby area where the brunch was served is very spacious with lush sofa / chairs. The food was served in a 3 tier tray, which had savoury (pulled pork mini burger, cucumber sandwich, lobster in waffles shell, cheese on biscuit, crepe roll etc) and sweets (macaroon, lemon tart, chocolate tart, chocolate banana, praline chocolates, fruit cake, pistachio choux pastry etc). In our opinion (4 of us), the savouries were much better than the sweet items. TWG teas and coffees were refillable, and we could choose as many options as we like in the sitting. The coffees were not impressive, but the selection of fine teas made up for it. Service was good, prompt and always polite. Certainly would return
4
forgot to take pics of the 3 tier platter. free flow of twg tea and coffee. canapés were not too bad. lobster mini cups and salmon quiches were my favorite. complimentary carpark available.
4
Good atmosphere. However, the service was bad and the the variety wasn't a lot.. It's a good experience to chill out with friends there with a cup of tea
5
Service was excellent! Able to cater to the needs of customers. Staff was attentive and polite. Food served was great!
5
We stumbled upon the Landing Point after enjoying the glorious reception area of the Fullerton by the Bay. The "free-flowing" delights never seemed to end - so sooner had we indulged in the delicious morsels set before us then they were swiftly and elegantly replaced by our lovely hostess Angel. We spend a relaxing and very enjoyable afternoon soaking up the atmosphere with a glass of champagne and our choice of teas - again, never ending! Definitely on our list to return
4
My overall experience at The Landing Point was a pleasant one. Staff were generally attentive and service-centric while the food was good. A good mix of savory and sweet items and quality drinks. In particular, my friend and I enjoyed the egg mayo truffle sandwiches as well as the lobster mix that we had about 3 or 4 refills.
4
Seated with a view facing Marina Bay Sands- the high tea was served with TWG tea and came in 3 tiers. First and third tier was mostly savory - second tier all sweets. The savory assortment consisted of lobster basket (delicious by the way) , salmon sandwich, egg truffle sandwich, quiche, chicken wrap, cream cheese with crackers and some Parma ham on tiny bagel. Sweets selection - chocolate tart with caramel (rich and yummy), eclair, lemon tart, fruit cake, macaroons, Madeleine's and some cake with alcohol flavoring. You can choose to alternate your drink choices with coffee and tea and quite a good selection of TWG teas. Both the sweets and savory selection are refillable. Definitely an ideal place to catch up with friends or just enjoy the high tea with a fantastic view. The high tea person was $48++ and you can get complimentary car park with $100 spent. Good service from Angel, very pleasant and smiley. Don't expect to walk away feeling very full as these are served in delicate portions
4
Having tried many afternoon teas I decided to try the Landing Point in the Fullerton Bay. They kindly fitted me in at the last minute. The sandwiches, sliders, cakes and scones were delicious. The choice of teas are wide-ranging. If you sit in the right spot you can have a beautiful view of the Marina. Definitely recommend the duck sliders.
4
My husband & I decided to have high tea at the landing point. We had no booking but they managed to squeeze us in. You have a choice of a large range of teas which are bottomless (but really how much tea can you really drink in one sitting) There was lots of food, we enjoyed most of them however some of the chocolate deserts were too rich for me. The hotel is beautiful, I would love to stay here. It elegantly decorated with a lovely view of Marina Bay. We had difficulty getting attention of staff to give us the bill but at least they weren't rushing us out the door. Things to note... This is quite fancy so don't turn up in sneakers after walking around all day. They will probably let you in but you will feel uncomfortable. We were neatly dressed but most people are here for a special occasion so they are well dressed
4
Twenty of us had dinner in Landing Point on Monday 4th July after a show at the Esplanade We were superbly attended to by Ms Aprilyn and her two colleagues who were most courteous, attentive and eager to please. Since they politely declined our offer of monetary appreciation for their services, we wrote in to inform their management to record our thanks and appreciation for their dedication to their employment.Our compliments also go to the Chefs for the Grilled Angus Beef Entrecote, the Wagyu Cheeseburger, Pan Fried Bass Fillet et cetera. We understand that there were only two of them in the kitchen, yet between them, they crafted up twenty sumptuous dishes plus dessert
4
My husband and I went to The Landing Point today at 2pm. The lady advised us that we would need to finish by 3pm as they had to turnaround for the second round of high tea service at 3.30pm. We were fine with that and did not anticipate staying for too long. Seating - we were given a table next to the glass window facing the Marina Bay. View-wise, it was pretty. However, our seats were basically high barstools. Not very appropriate for having tea and sandwiches, I have mobility issues and found it hard to get on and off the chairs. For the entire meal, my legs were left swinging, it was mildly uncomfortable. It would have been better if they had regular or plush chairs with lower tables for afternoon tea.Food - they have a wide selection of teas and coffees, which was great. The club sandwich was rather dry but the truffle fries which came with it was good, I personally would have preferred a stronger dosage of truffle oil. The Yuzu gin and tonic is to die for, we really liked it.Service - the staff who served us were very good. However, a few points to note. We arrived at 2pm and ordered the food quickly as we were told that we would need to vacate by 3pm. We ended up waiting till 2.30pm and the food never came, so we had to check with the staff. By the time the food came, we had 20-25 minutes left to gobble the food, which wasn't great. Furthermore, a group of Japanese tourists came at 2.40pm and wanted to sit at a sofa area which was already reserved for the 3.30pm tea service. The staff brusquely told them to sit outside, and when they refused (as it was a very hot afternoon) and said that they could finish by 3pm, the staff were very inflexible and insisted that they could not sit there. They did not provide the guests any alternatives and even though the guests did suggest sitting elsewhere, it was not possible either as the staff said everything was reserved. In the end, the guests left. We feel that this should have been handled a lot better. It was also stressful to the other guests who overheard and saw the incident and we could not enjoy our meal as much as we wanted to as the guests were protesting quite loudly and the staff just stood there and did nothing else.Overall, a nice place for a drink and a bite, we saw many people enjoying the afternoon tea service. However, service definitely needs some improvement in terms of handling situations like what I had highlighted above.

Great experience with great view. The service staff was friendly, but the serving of the food was a bit slow. need to remind the staff at times.
5
Sat just by the high ceiling window facing MBS the afternoon tea at Fullerton Bay hotel was very enjoyable. Great choice of tea and coffees and lovely three tiers with delicious savoury and sweet treats. The lobster and smoked duck are just delicious. We got refilled a few times to our own surprise. The service was great as the staff was regularly checking on us to make sure we had everything we needed. Would highly recommend

Had a great experience at landing point! not only can we top up our food, we got a rose and photo of my girl friend and i in a frame as a gift
4
What a wonderful Hi Tea, I've been to numerous Hi-Teas and none compare to the one at the Landing Point. The food was delicious and to my surprise they re-filled the serving stand, something I'm not use to in Australia. We went for the 2nd sitting on a Saturday afternoon which I'd recommend because you don't feel rushed, you can just sit there and take your time. The tables aren't in a perfect setting you kind of feel like you are in a thoroughfare, but any issue I had with this was quickly alleviated with how fantastic the food was, and at $45 per head I thought it was great value for money too
4
We were greeted warmly when we approached the hostess and swiftly shown to our table. The high table did not seem too appropriate for a sit-down meal as they may be slightly uncomfortable for people experiencing difficulty reaching for the seats. No matter as we were not fussy.The promotional drinks were recommended by the service team member, which we ordered; and dinner was the curry chicken and the bass fillet. The food was tasty and well cooked. Dessert from the menu though, in my personal opinion; did not suit us but as we walked along the bar counter on our way out, we noticed 2 covered trays with very appealing-looking cakes. It was a pity as we could have had a slice each, but could not recall if we were being offered.Nevertheless, the main courses were good enough. Well done
5
Love the ambience, it's a wonderful place to have a chit-chat with your girlfriends. Scones are also one of the best I've tried in Singapore.
4
Had an enjoyable time at the Landing Point for Hi-Tea, the food was good, but it took awhile for us to get the staff to refill the hi-tea set at times.
5
had a great experience having high tea with a lovely view at the landing point will most definitely return again
4
Had the weekday high tea set $45++ for a 3 tiered tray with choice of any TWG tea selection. The lime tart and chocolate items are great. Service was great and only gripe was the lack of initiative to refill the popular items without asking. Most other items like sandwiches and savory items were refilled very frequently. It's a good place for business or casual conversations.

As a family, we've visited many higher end locations in Singapore for High Tea (as a family). Please see other reviews for comparisons.The Landing Point started poorly. We arrived on time and were told we were moved back an hour. They did try to inform us that morning, but we were out and did not receive the call (note: calling the day of to move a reservation is not ideal).The staff was tense this day. I think the turnout was higher than expected (which probably accounted for our reservation being pushed back).Once we were seated, the service was initially slow. It took some time to get the food and tea. Once it arrived, it was very good. The selection was great and consisted of high quality ingredients. We were also able to select additional food later as ours ran out. The manager was fantastic and was busy ensuring everyone was happy. On some instances, we had asked for additional tea (or hot chocolate for our children). Some came fast, and some took over 15 minutes and we may have received extra drinks as they attempted to serve everyone. In other words, it was a little disorganized.We would go back on perhaps a non-holiday. The staff was friendly as the day progressed. The manager was great and apologised for some of the challenges we faced. Service and the reservation being moved an hour were not ideal and caused the lower score. The food and price were very good. I suspect that the volume of people caused the difficulties and suspect this will be addressed in the future.
4
The only place to see the Singapor Night Light Show! Nice food! Great menus selections! Great location! Great decor! on the top of the spectacular Fullerton Bay Hotel. If you are a guest it also provides service to the glorius rooftop pool deck. Would go there again in a heartbeat. All ages of crowd.
3
For stunning views of the Singapore River and Esplanade skyline while having a leisurely afternoon tea, this is a great place to go. The food and service though falls behind other hotels serving high tea. We had to wait quite a bit for beverage re-orders, especially for the espresso brewed coffees. Waiters were trying their best to fulfil orders but there was simply too much of a backlog. And apart from the scones, cucumber sandwich and lobster cup, the rest of the pastries, sandwiches and sweets looked decidedly pedestrian.
4
Free flow sweets and savory dishes with nice twg tea. Great place to spend a lazy afternoon! Wonderful service too
5
The service is pretty good. Especially the maly guy who served us but we did not take down his name and a lady Ms Sue is Friendly. A word to describe, POWER!
5
We really enjoyed the food at the afternoon high tea. The servers were generous with refilling the trays frequently, and we were surprisingly filled after eating all the tasty little bites. Good variety of savory/sweet. We aren't tea drinkers but had hoped to try an herbal tea to go along with the experience; none of the teas on the menu were herbal/fruit based, though many had tea leaves that had been infused with a variety of herbs and fruits
5
Came here for some drinks one evening during our stay in Singapore. The place was so nice and relaxing that we decided to come again the next evening already. The view towards Marina Bay is amazing, even more so when amplified with the smooth piano music. The service was great, clearly well-trained and very friendly staff. Haven't tried the food though, so cannot comment on that. Easily one of my favourite evening choices while in SG :
4
Good atmosphere and relaxing, with very good live music in piano.The food is auto-refilled quite frequently. Drinks have wide variety of choice. However, the food for high tea is not totally in good quality. Hotel needs to re-decide the menu and the kind of food or dessert provided. Overall good experience
5
The ambience is good, especially the river view...Room for improvement for the services. Could have been better if the waitress can do a quick intro..
4
While the view and service was great, high tea set was average, especially the desserts were kind of disappointing
5
Stopped in here one afternoon to cool off after a busy morning of sightseeing. The tea was delicious, service impeccable and atmosphere superb. I reminisce of this afternoon quite frequently. Top notch
4
It was lovely, beautiful scenery. Every visitor should go there at least more than once! Indulge if you haven't!
5
We like to have Afternoon Tea here - a good variety of tastes and a great selection of teas. We have also had supper - good Singaporean variety foods.
4
I've always wanted to go for classy high tea in a hotel and Landing Point didn't disappoint. What I Loved:1. The view and the ambience won me over more than anything else. The tables / couches were well spaced so it never felt like it was too crowded even if the whole place was booked. At some point, there was even a pianist who sang love songs beautifully. 2. The tea selection was surprisingly a lot. The flavors are strong and they give you one pot per order. I liked the tea better than the coffee. 3. The food had a variety of sweet and savory items. And at first, you just can't help but take a photo first because they were beautifully presented. The amount want overwhelming and everything's repleshinable. 4. I got a refreshing lemon tart as a birthday treat! And they allowed us to stay through the next seating. I got really lucky because the next seating wasn't full and likely because it was a birthday high tea that my friend and I were having. What I Wanted to Ask For:There's only 1 thing which I feel needed improvement - it's the replenishing of the items. The way it works is that the lady servers will go around with trays of goodies. But I felt that it wasn't as often as I hoped and that they didn't have a full selection of items when they go around. So when we asked for a specific type, it never arrived. Overall:Would I go back there again? Oh yes, most definitely! It was all well worth it. But then, I'll likely try other places first just so I have others to compare it with.

Went for high tea with a girlfriend. Booked the 3pm slot but was told it starts at 3.30pm. Asked for iced water while we waited, didn't come. We had to also check again with the reception whether we could be seated yet after, because no one paid attention to us :( There wasn't much people at that time though. Waited quite a while for the high tea set.The high tea consisted mainly of sweets and a few savory items. For a price of $49++, I was expecting something better but they were mostly average. The view was quite nice, and I really liked the beverages. We were seated at a high table, which was alright but I think the sofa seats would have been more comfy. Service was fine, but really had to give a thumbs up to one of the waitress, who always had a smile when she attended to us. Will come back again for drinks, but probably not for the high tea
5
Had afternoon tea at one of the high bar tables next to the windows overlooking the harbour. The view was excellent as was the afternoon tea itself. The tea and coffee was free-flowing and we could also change our choices freely. There were more sweets on the 3-tier stand than we could comfortably manage and additional savories were regularly offered on platters by passing personnel
4
Loved the food here - food selection is great and it isn't as expensive as some of the other hotels. Strongly recommend the local selections that's on offer. We also tried the high tea once but as it was a weekend, the service was patchy. Overall gd place but service can be improved
4
The Landing Point is kinda the 'lobby lounge' of Fullerton Bay hotel . The hotel 's interiors is cosy and inviting - which makes The Landing Point equally comfortable .Ask for seats by the window for a view of Singapore River . I try to avoid the seats along the walkway as I can't relax with people from the nearby offices walking by . Having said that, this seems to be popular for afternoon tea with ladies and leisure travelers.I have been here many times- but my favourite moments are drinks at dusk in the outdoor area with light bites .
5
It was my best girlfriend birthday so I decided to bring her to the landing point for high-tea. It was one of the recommended place to catch up with friends over nice hot tea and cakes. Upon our arrival we were warmly greeted, which was really nice. And after checking my reservation the lady at the counter ushered us to our table. We were spoilt for the tea choices hence she recommended us the best tea that we might want to try. We ordered two high tea sets. I must say, the ambience was rather peaceful and comfortable, eventhough we sat next to the glass panel along the walk way, it did not quite bother us. The high tea set was surprisingly good. We enjoyed the pretty cakes and tarts. To further enhance our awesome high tea, we were accompanied by a pianist with a soothing voice. The service was superb, we were constantly approached and asked if there is anything more that we would like to order despite the fact that they refilled out high tea tiers. We will definitely come again! We had a good time.
5
the cakes and pastries are all refillable, no limit to the number of coffee/tea you can order. staff are pleasant and refills are quite frequent. sit near the window if you want to have a good view of the river and MBS. even though the afternoon tea timing was only from 3-5.30pm, we sat there till 8.30pm and they did not chase/hurry us away :)recommended place to chill and catch up with friends with good view and food
5
Excellent service - staff were very friendly and attentive to the customers. The ambience is excellent with indoor and outdoor seating. Food was delicious (AND REFILLABLE) selection of tea time bites. Was my first time visiting even though friends have mentioned good things about Landing Point and I'm glad to say that they were absolutely right
3
the iron basket to carry the dessert is not cleaned before they are being served.
It doesn't look good when it is being served at such a nice ambience reataurant
2
Waiting time for the food to be refilled is long.
ordered a cuppucino and it took near to an hour to be served
4
Value for money. Though at the price of $49/pax, we had a great time n left with my bff kept praising about the spread and quality of her finger food, especially the savory ones. I totally agreed!Here's why:1. Everything is being served and free flow and they were attentive in making their rounds to check if you wanted any more and before you realized it, we ate our share for dinner as well! Staffs were professional and friendly. 2. Food were delicious and delicately prepared with quality. Scones were kept warm and best eaten with the blob of thick cream! We were so full that we didn't Eat the macaroons and Xmas fruit cake which were more common. I especially loved the cucumber sandwich and the mayo/truffle oil sandwich. 3. Pampered with a variety of tea! I ordered a latte to start with and to my delight, I could order as many pots of different tea until closing. So we ordered borbon vanilla, Moroccan mint, imperial oolong to wash down our food.My friend said let's come back here and do this again ! One thing we didn't like though was the high chair which was quite uncomfortable.

Reserved at 3pm but was informed at the reception that there were 2 high tea seatings. The next was 3.30pm. I thought I was the only one who was not aware as this Infor of 2 seatings was no where to be found on the website. To my surprise other customers also showed up at 3pm only to be told that it will start at 3.30pm. When we were showed the tea menu, it was also stated in the menu that high tea was from 3-5.30pm. Some inconsistency here. I even have the email booking The food was good. Seating was good. Tea and coffee was exceptional. Only problem as that service was slow and many others around us were also impatiently waiting for their initial high tea set and also top ups. We were seated at around 3.25 but our 3 tier tea set also arrived at 4pm and that was after signalling to the staff. Staff was also not prompt in their top ups. I realised that all these was not just our table but what others were experiencing as well. I saw patrons signalling for their initial set. I also saw my neighbouring table walking up to staff to ask for drinks and top ups as the staff were not responding to their request. Overall, it was a disappointing experience. Although I have read good reviews about he place, but my personal experience was not what I had expected. Definitely not worth a return. Rather proceed to other high tea areas in other hotels with much better service and maybe equivalent of food standard. Last words, an over hyped placed.
4
The place was packed even thought it was a weekday afternoon. The savoury items were pretty good, especially the Lobster Tartlet and Smoke Salmon Sandwich. The only desserts that left an impression are the Salted Caramel Choc Tart and Lemon Tart. However, there are a couple of items such as Mayo Egg Sandwich, Madeleine, Fruit Cake, etc. which are pretty much ordinary. Service was not as prompted as expected and can be improved.

Thoroughly enjoyed the great service by every staff. Requested for window seats and change of seats - staff kindly and gladly assisted to the request. Threw a little surprise for my friend with a cake and birthday song when I only mentioned that it is a birthday get together. Lastly, food was just lovely for me. My friend and I were super delighted to discover that the egg mayo sandwich was loaded with truffle we had lots of it! The desserts were mostly yummy too especially the lemon meringue and chocolate caramel tart. Least to say, Coffee and Tea was perfect companion.

This was my second visit to the Landing Point, on which I have brought my mother. It was not a special occasion, but rather, just a day to say thank you to her for working hard for us as a homemaker.Service was good, but they could really do with more staff, as we've faced difficulty getting the attention of staff members for tea refills etc. Apart from that, I have no complaints - staff members were attentive and helpful, the tea selection was extensive and the pastries were simply delicious. We would have been treated to a great view of Marina Bay Sands, except that it was a little too hazy then.The pastries were also refill-able, so one could basically eat to one's fill at the Landing Point. I preferred the savoury choices over the sweet ones, but that of course, was a personal preference. Some personal favourites and recommendations include the cucumber sandwiches, smoked salmon sandwiches and the lobster salad tart.Mum also enjoyed the scones (both plain and the ones with raisins) very much, especially with clotted cream. Overall, a big yes to revisiting the Landing Point. Among other high tea venues, it is honestly not the easiest on the wallet, but it's worth every cent for the smile on the face across the table.

Wonderful place to go for a lovely afternoon tea with friends and family. From the interior decorations, the splendid view of singapore river to the sumptuous pastries and tea. Everything is so perfect. The service crew are friendly and polite, sparing no effort to make it a lovely session. Would love to go back again

Afternoon tea at The Landing Point with sparking wine and unlimited food - what could have been better! A lovely atmosphere, a lovely view, and efficient and friendly staff. We were there on our honeymoon and a memorable touch was the "congratulations" pudding they brought us out after we'd finished our afternoon tea. It really made the afternoon there all the more special alongside the very tasty food and high quality tea and coffee we'd already had, I thoroughly recommend this
5
We went for afternoon tea which was excellent. The best thing about it was the refills for both food and drink that are included. My boyfriend prefers savoury so the extra sandwiches were a treat for him as he normally is left wanting more of those. Atmosphere was great- a pianist was playing and the Fullerton bat hotel lobby is worth a look around as it's very impressive. Good view of the quay too
3
I find the food here is just average. Service is below average. Ambience is above average. Maybe will only come for a drink next trip.
5
Had a couple of business meetings there, nice view and great service. Coffee was good but of course expensive. Better booking in advance. Top experience.
2
Been to clifford pier one...service staff are much better and food tastes far much better!! Will give landing point a miss in future! Not recommended!
3
I booked through chope.Co. and requested for seat with good view as it was my hubby bday. was disappointed that I was given a table for 2 along the corridor with no view. Food is not warm. As we are not within the main dining area, the waitresses often could not attend to us and skipped us a few times to top up our savouries.
5
The ambience was great with light music in the background. Salty and sweet selections were both good and refills were frequent. Request for a birthday cake was granted without question and it came with a birthday song by the pianist. To add, it was on the house as well. Overall a very pleasant experience and we will definitely be going back again
5
We had high tea at the landing point and it was so special. The hotel did not secure our booking so we had to sit in the other section but they brought all the food to us and it was still an incredible experience. Everything is delicious, sweet, and decadent. The tea selection is huge and does not disappoint. a very special place
3
Firstly, I've booked a table with them thru email and I mention that we have 2 adults and 1 baby with us, but when we reached our table was not set for the no of pax but with 4 pax cutlery and they gave us a not so baby friendly seating which cause to one of our unhappiness after that. Secondly, when the hi-tea snacks came the waiting time for them to refill the food was so long and they keep skipping our table not sure of what reason thou. Thirdly, due to the not so baby friendly area our boy actually threw my hubby glasses down to the slot between the sofa and the bar below our seating. So when we request for help to retrieve the glasses one of the guy staff actually told us they will inform another dept to get the necessary tool to retrieve and we actually waited for about 30 - 45 mins but no one came to retrieve it. So when we asked for the bill with another cashier named Trizza we also told her if she could get help to retrieve the glasses soon as we were about to leave. So she just went and check on the location and within 5 mins she just get the glasses for us without any tools needed

For full review and photos, please visit:http://summerlovestoeat.blogspot.sg/2015/07/afternoon-tea-at-landing-point-80.htmlAfternoon Tea: Refillable 3-Tier Stand + Free Flow of Coffee and TWG Tea SelectionThe staff will use a tray to bring over some high tea items to each table regularly and ask if you want a refill but they always bring those unpopular items. Popular items like - Creme Brulee Chocolate Tart, Salted Caramel Chocolate Tart and Lobster Tartlet were rarely bring over unless you keep on request. They took a very long time to replenish those popular items. So request as early as possible otherwise they will only bring out around ending time. Service was polite but quite slow here as this place is always crowded. Only the female manager "Aprilyn" provide the BEST service. They were all seemed very busy perhaps this was why most of the staff did not put on much smile. They serve very good coffee and premium TWG Tea + this is the only place to have good chocolate tarts and lobster tarts that are refillable so I will recommend this place for high tea
5
Highly recommended bar within the beautiful Fullerton Bay Hotel. Superb craft cocktails, live pianist on a baby grand, great views of MBS, and flawless lighting & decor. All of this came together to create an incredibly relaxing experience. Great staff and very talented mixologist. I couldn't help but observe the perfection and effort put into each cocktail made.

We recently enjoyed High Tea here and the three tiered stand full of food that was constantly topped up was amazing. The vegetarian options were superb and I couldn't get enough of the truffle egg sandwiches and cucumber sandwiches. One of my main reasons I chose to go here was because it is not a buffet style High Tea.The vanilla tea I drank was really divine. Champagne was expensive but good!The service was what let the day down. With the price you pay, you'd expect a smile or some sort of interaction with the staff but no, this was not the case. I distinctly remember one waitress pouring our tea when she brought it out, so fast. It was a rushed pour which one would do when they are trying to get somewhere urgently. She may even hold a world record for the fastest tea pourer at High Tea. The girl who poured our champagne did the most incredibly slow pour but she took her time and it was quite possibly therapeutic seeing it fill slowly ;) Booking the high tea from overseas was easy and our request for a table with a view was met. We went on a Thursday and almost every table was filled.I requested a special vegetarian High Tea and there was a man who seemed to be in charge and appear a few times during our high tea, who I wish was on the floor the whole time. He was lovely and his staff could certainly use a few tips from him. I've ranked the High Tea as 'Very Good ' as the food & tea was just that. If the customer service was there it would've been even better and on par with Ritz Carlton

Near the lobby of Fullerton Bay Hotel. Nice view of Marina Bay. Friendly service with an early evening happy hour. Also seems to be popular for a late afternoon tea.
4
We stopped for lunch at the Fullerton Bay to treat ourselves to a fancy meal (a change from food courts!).. The food was very nice and the service was good.
After lunch take a stroll around the water to the Merlion.
5
If given the change take evening drinks at this lovely hotel rather than Marina Bay Sands as the view is just as outstanding, if not quite so high. The service and costs will more than meet your expectations.
5
On my last weekend working in Singapore I came here for a quiet lunch in a beautiful location and I was not disappointed. The staff were very helpful and nice to chat with as I was on my own. It was nice and peaceful but with a good atmosphere and the view over the marina was lovely. The food was delicious! Not only that on learning that it was my birthday this week during our earlier talk, the waitress came out singing happy birthday with a cake for me. A very touching a memorable lunch time treat. Thank you to you at the Landing Point

The first time we went to this restaurant for afternoon tea, we were impressed. The view was magnificent. Overlooking the stunning marina bay. The pastry and sandwiches were also delicious and refillable. The second time we were there it was not so great. For some reason the quality of food dropped incredibly. It was truly disappointing as we felt like the pastry we had was of the frozen variety. Hopefully management would look into this and ensure consistency in product
3
The view is excellent and a great place for casual drinks with friends but the service needs some work especially during busy times. They also need to work on the menu some. But nothing can distract from the view and well worth a visit with a cocktail or two
4
We went to The Landing Point for afternoon tea some days ago. Securing a table with sea view, we could enjoy the food whilst appreciating the beauty of Marina Bay. The food and the tea were fine and the waitresses kept asking if we needed extra pastries. Service was good and we both had an enjoyable afternoon!One minus is if you want both sea view and air conditioning, you can only choose bar tables, which are a bit less comfortable. Tables with cosy sofas don't offer much sea view. Yet, bar tables should be fine if you go there for drinks anyway.
4
It's little known, but there is happy hour on the Veranda until 7pm. Wine is $12. The food, available after happy hour, is quite reasonably priced for the view. Fantastic view of the practice National Day fireworks.It's not commonly known, but the pier is open free to the public
3
I had booked afternoon tea for 3 of us as a birthday present for my friends 30th birthday. While we waited for her husband to arrive we ordered drinks, my friend asked for a cup of hot milk and myself a latte. My friend had to ask about 3 times about her hot milk drink and when my latte arrived, it was barely warm. The food was enjoyed by the three of us, but I wouldn't go overboard with the service that they provide
4
The hotel is very grand so when we entered, we felt a sense of awe. We were seated beside the glass wall overlooking the river and MBS which was such a treat. The wait staff were attentive and friendly. They remembered our orders and came back to replenish the food items quite frequently. Only small feedbacks to give, for such a classy establishment, it would be good if the wait staff did not use bring their ingredients (tub of mayonaise, containers of cooking ingredients) pass their guests. Serving "shelf" for the high tea items that came to our table could not "stand" properly without tilting badly to one side. The waiter had to add drink coasters to balance off. Other that these 2 minor areas, it was totally enjoyable and I am happy we chose to spend our half day leave at the Landing Point. 
4
I was taken here for lunch and enjoyed the 1920's era decor and limited but high quality carvery business lunch. Would go back for a business lunch again.
4
The service is very quick and the menu is also not that confusing. Juices are freshly prepared and food is served hot.
2
We arrived 15 minutes before High Tea commences. We were among the first 3 tables to arrive and were shown to our table and given the menu to order our beverage. We ordered our pots of tea and coffee and were served scones when the High Tea timing commences. After 45 minutes our high tea food which is usually served on a 3 layer Art DÃ©cor tray just wouldn't arrived regardless that we enquired about our food. The frustrating thing is all the other tables that arrived later were already served and patrons eating. And what is most infuriating is we can see waitresses bringing in trays of food and they were actually replenishing the other tables while we were kept waiting to be served our first tray. It was after we confronted the head waitress and threatened to leave that were finally served our trays of pastries.I really cannot comprehend why the waitiresses could have the cheek to replenish the tables next to us when we were not even being served the first. Secondly why are we being served so late into the meal when we were the first to arrive.And mind you it was a $45++ per person High Tea for pastries and tea. The so called replenishment were mainly for mini-sandwiches and not for the nice cute pastries.My advice to those "die die must go to show face" patrons - 1) don't be early , 2)if you don't get served in 15 mins after you had sat down, you aren't gonna be served, say something. 3) there are really better places with lot more efficient and professional service staf
2
Service was slow and efficient. Asked the staff to serve the tea set and they took a long time. Replenish of the food items were slow as well. Had to ask a few times to request of simple finger food items like sandwich. Many food items we'd like to replenish were unavailable at just 4pm, we had to wait till about 5.15pm for the food we requested to be served, when the high tea timing ends at 5.30pm. As a result, we did not get to eat much at all as the service was so slow, by the time they replenish the food, there wasn't much time left to eat. The food was also mediocre. The only saving grace was that the ambiance was good, with a view of MBS, but with such poor service, it was still quite a disappointing experience.
2
We were here for afternoon high tea, to celebrate a friend's child 1st year.Really this has got to be one of the worst high tea that I have tried. The place is very small, the choice of food is so limited & pathetic; and the taste so plain. It is really mediocre food. Probably can get much better food from a caterer. Just not worth it
5
We had some time to kill on our last afternoon in Singapore, so we tried the afternoon tea here. The price seemed reasonable relative to what we've experienced in this city but we weren't sure what the price would include.We needn't have worried. The selection of both sweet and savoury items was very extensive, and all of them were nicely prepared. What's more, they came around with "refills" of many of the selections.We were very impressed
4
We went to the Landing Point for high tea today for my daughters birthday. Service was top rate & we had plenty of refills & we tried various pots of tea & I had a nice coffee as well. My daughter received a birthday cake with her name written in chocolate which was a lovely touch. The setting was brilliant looking out at Marina Bay Sands. Thank you everyone at The Landing Point

I was there with my mum and aunt for high tea on a Monday afternoon.It's not a holiday, and I used Hungry Go Where around noon to make a reservation for 3pm. It wasn't crowded, but they gave us a low sofa and coffee table type of seat, which wasn't really good for high tea, and wouldn't allow for us to change the seats. Other than that, they were a bit under-staffed - it was hard to get their attention to place an order at first, and I had to walk up to the counter, but after placing our order for their high tea sets, Emily brought us our tea, food and even came by to check to see if we needed refills of tea or any of the various snacks. I really appreciate her service.I would really give this place a 3.5 - above average, but not very good. Simply because the food was alright, but the ambiance was good; the service was a bit slow, but Emily made it better. I did enjoy myself, but I think it was mostly because of the company, not so much as because of the restaurant.(Each set worked out to be about $57, so... Honestly, I didn't regret the spending, but it could have been better.
5
The restaurant features a nice semi-colonial style and despite the large hall the noise level is pretty ok. We enjoyed a business lunch that was of a very good quality and taste, the service quick, friendly and capable. We also enjoyed the High Tea ... Very nice mixture of pastries both sweet and meat/fish style, nice setting, nice experience... Reservation recommended
5
I had previously visited The Landing Point for the Afternoon Tea in Sep this year. Was not impressed with their service then. Was made to wait for almost an hour before I was served the coffee I had ordered. However, I did like the atmosphere as well as the food, so decided to give it another chance.On my second visit, I was truly impressed with the service. The waitress was very attentive and we were served promptly on seated. She also made it a point to offer use refill of the food items from the afternoon tea without any prompting. Unfortunately, I was too busy enjoying the food and the service, I forgot to get her name.
4
Went for after dinner drinks. The views were spectacular. Service was not brilliant and expensive too.
4
It is one of the best place for hightea. quiet place and nice view of MBS. Food: hightea serves in 3tier tray, selections were pretty reasonable. Would return again.
5
I went with my sister and my cousin who were visiting Singapore. The tea and food were excellent, coupled with the ambiance and service, made it a perfect Friday afternoon for us. This is my second afternoon tea experience with them and I am extremely pleased
5
I had patronised this place for a couple of times for their high tea. It's worth price as you get refills for your food and you can enjoy different flavours of twg tea. What makes the experience better is that you could choose to sit outdoors and be wowed by the view of singapore river and the marina bay area. If not, you could choose to sit on bar seats indoor and over look at the lovely view too . A must try and value for money place.
5
This place was either busy or closed for a function most of the time. One weekday, we had a nice lunch here. We were in shorts and a TShirt and the business men were in suits. They said we wer fine and seated in middle of a business crowd. Service was excellent as they kept checking on us. Food was top notch too. Would recommend for a leisurely lunch. We ordered off the menu but the buffet looked very good and was popular with the business crowd
4
Made a table reservation at 230pm via the online system. However was surprised to be advised the high tea starts at 3pm instead. My friend and I were given a high table at the side of the full length window, where we can see the view across to MBS. Unlike the normal self-serve buffet style where you take your own food, you will be fully served by staff at The Landing Point, where food is presented on a 3-tier tray. There are more sweets than savory ones and food is replenish-able. There's a wide range of teas available from TWG.

I dont know what it is with some places in Singapore? They have everything else going for them and are let down time and time again with service that wouldnt even cut the mustard in a McDonalds. This place has incredible views, opulent and stunning decor, top end furnishings and a great wine / drinks selection. But it took 5 minutes standing waiting at the front to even get some recognition, 10 minutes to get a menu, zero knowledge about the contents of such menu and then once we had ordered a further 10 minutes to bring out one bottle of wine and five wine glasses. We were entertaining clients and I was highly embarrassed. I leaned to the idea of ordering more wine to try and get us all through the experience and selected a different bottle. This came out a little quicker, but then they were a mili second away from pouring it into the same glass that was half full with a different wine. All five of us dived forward to stop them and made it just in time, despite the look on the waitresses of confusion as to why this was a bad idea.I asked to please transfer the bill to the restaurant as we were going there next and this was clearly too difficult as they had to confer together on what to do, so we opted to just sign it and start again. Fullerton-Bay Management; please please please do something about this. I tried to explain it to someone when i was there, but that equally wasnt well understood. The team need more urgency, better basic knowledge of how to serve & monitor a table and then the occasional smile would be a nice finishing touch
4
We had afternoon tea at the Landing Point on a sunday and the service left a lot to be desired. 1 of the female wait staff could hardly speak english and had difficulty understanding our simple request of wanting the afternoon tea set to be served. I would expect that such a fine establishment that sees a large number of foreign guests would hire staff that can speak and understand proper english. Service was also incredibly slow and inattentive, and it felt like they paid a lot more attention to the caucasian tourists (we were a group of local asians). It took very long for us to get our refills. Would not return
5
My boyfriend and I decided to go for drinks after work after receiving some good news, seeing as we were both working around raffles place, we decided to head to the nearest which was One Fullerton. Upon arrival, we were greeted warmly, seated and served. But what struck me the most was the attentiveness of the staff, we were offered chips as soon as the bottom of the bowl was visible. And our drinks were served quickly and service was not only efficient but friendly yet professional by the superb bartender - Roy. The ambience is great for a catchup with a close friend, a romantic evening or even a business meeting, with soothing jazz music from the resident singer whom I must say has a really beautiful voice. Although it is pricey, it is worth it for a special occasion - will definitely return
3
Been here twice, both for their afternoon high tea. The second time I went there was during the Christmas season and I didn't really quite enjoy their Christmas selection. Service was really great. I was told in advance by the staff that they would replace the non-halal sandwiches to other halal sandwich options. I wouldn't mind recommending this place for high tea to my friends if they're after good ambience and view
4
Had a lovely glass of wine and we're surprised by the terrific piano player and torch singer. ... so pleasant to sit and enjoy the wine and music.
Unobtrusive service. Beautiful room.
4
Being our favorite hotel in Singapore we like to enjoy high tea at the Landing Point. It is excellent and the service is always good. We enjoy the whole Fullerton Bay experience and the location cannot be beat.
5
I wandered in to the Fullerton just to get a look around and was delighted at the gorgeous holiday decorations, especially the teddy bear tree! I ended up having some delicious tea and cakes and then later on a drink and listened to some wonderful music. The service was exceptional, the cakes delicsh - the ambiance classic, yet very comfortable....the whole experience was just delightful. I am glad that I visited and will go back again! Recommended....

We were celebrating my friends last day as a single woman and decided to go for afternoon tea at Fullerton bay - what a mistake....... It started with the overpowering scent in the seating area - too strong, feels like you can taste the scent. We moved outside ok so far, lovely view, nice weather. The waitress came to open the champagne - lucky the cork hit the window and not one of us, she had no idea how to pour it either - only been here a few months not her fault. We were served our items, that was the last time we saw any service staff...... The food was ok not great, we had asked for a jug of water nothing came, it was very obvious they were short of staff. I can forgive a lot of things but this was too much, a couple of hours we were sitting, no staff asked if we wanted more, no clearance, no service. A special day with a memorable experience all for the wrong reasons. Tried to get the bill, the staff disappeared and never came back, found the manager and mentioned what happened, he was stressed, whilst dealing with me and looking for the bill, he then decided to assist a few other guests without excusing himself from dealing with us. He comp the bill but I will never go or recommend it to others it simply was not worth it. They were clearly overwhelmed and understaffed and it's such a shame
4
Met up with a group of friends for high-tea session on a sat afternoon. This is my first visit to the landing point and am quite happy with my experience there. We were given the comfy sofa area, which is a plus point, with a great view of marina bay. For the high tea buffet, they provide quite a wide range of TWG teas. I chose the "weekend in Shanghai"-green tea with a tint of berries taste to it (Nice). Shortly after we settled down, we were given scones and the 3-tiered high tea set. Though not all sweet & savoury treats are up to my liking, there are still some nice ones, such as the truffle egg sandwich, smoked salmon sandwich, lobster tart, lemon tart & biscuit with cheese and fig :) The scones were not too bad even though I had tasted better ones & would prefer them to be served hot rather than cold. In addition, a pianist started playing and singing at around 3.30pm. Though his skills and voice are good, I feel that the sound is quite loud as I need to strain my ears to listen to our converstion. Lastly, the service overall is good and the waitress made an effort to keep going round to refill our food
3
I met a colleague for lunch at the Landing Point. It's a pleasant setting, light and airy with good views over the harbour. I sat on a long banquette with lots of plump cushions and a fairly low set table, which was actually slightly difficut to eat lunch at - it seemed more suited to afternoon tea.The service was very slow and uninterested - we had to go and find a waiter to come and take our order, as did the table next to us.The menu had a good selection on it for a light lunch. I chose a seafood risotto. When it arrived I got the impression that it had been standing around for some considerable time before it was brought to the table - had it been fresh it would have been quite good. So it looks like the chef is being let down by the front of house staff. With better service this would be a pleasant place to go - but as it is, it's difficult to recommend
4
Went for high tea at this place, it's part of the lobby area of the hotel. Relaxing with live piano playing in the background. Crowd there is a mixture of local and expats with some using the place for business presentations. Food selection for high was an assortment of selections from sweet to savory. Love their tiny little sandwiches. All free flow and staff was attentive to replenish our tray. Tea was good as well. Overall good experience for price tag of $49.90++ although the counter greeting staff said that our reservation was not displayed even though it was pre booked

Hightea today at The Landing Point. We selected our teas while browsing the menus, wondering what to drink and eat, excited for our high tea session to kick start. The seats were very comfortable, no doubt - vintage, cushy couches and soft piano music floated through the air melodiously, setting the perfect ambience for catching up and lazing around on a hot, bright Sunday afternoon. We were also offered the magnificent views of Marina Bay Sands area, so while the mouth feasted, so did the eyes.The ala carte buffet-concept high tea goodies were served to us on a three-tiered tray. The drinks menu consisted of a rather wide assortment of TWG teas, coffees and other beverages. As for the buffet items, there were mouth-watering savoury bites and sweetly-sensational pastries, all available for more helpings when the service crew walks about with their refill trays.On the top tier, stacked neatly, are two each of Caramel-sea salt Chocolate Tarts and Creme Brulee Tarts in Chocolate Crusts. The Caramel-sea salt Chocolate Tartlets were rich, thick and an exotic blend of sweet-salty taste - I loved the sticky bittersweetness of the chocolate lava within a solid chocolatey crust.The Creme Brulee Tartlets consisted of the same solid chocolatey crusts and the golden center consisted of soft, butter-smooth egg-custard like filling and the aroma of vanilla-caramel blend. It was rather tasty if a tad sweet, but no worries, I have a sweet tooth.For more detailed information and photos, do visit:http://thearcticstar.blogspot.sg/2014/02/afternoon-high-tea-at-landing-point.htm

We decided as we were on this side of the river we would go and have afternoon tea at the Fullerton Hotel. They have done a wonderful job of renovating this iconic building. The staff were so very courteous and friendly. However down to afternoon tea. We only wanted coffee and cake and you go along and pick your own so we saw these meringues which were so big that we decided to share, we thought we hot half this meringue when it came it was the full one, absolutely huge !! It only cost 4 Singapore dollars so then the waiter came for our order and the only tea they had was the very popular TWG which I am afraid I do not like so we went for a nice coffee at 11 Singapore dollars a bit pricey I thought but we wanted to enjoy the ambience of the place? when it came it was literally that a glass of cold weak coffee with ice in it !!! So. I said this is not how you do ice coffee and explained how it should be made it came back with half a cup of weak iced coffe with a jug of milk, I thought what do you do, I should have suggested that their chefs go and check out how Starbucks do it? Anyway the meringue was so big so hard that we could not make an impression on it took back to the hotel with us and it has even travelled home in the suitcase and is still in one piece,!!!

Afternoon tea with champagne at the Fullerton Bay was meant to be the perfect way to end our Singapore trip. I'm disappointed to say that it was a bit of a let down. The service was poor - we felt we were invisible at times. The food was nice but our serving tray was not replenished to the same extent as others. We were asked once if we would like additional items but the requested savouries never materialised. I handed over my credit card to pay the bill and had to remind them 20 minutes later that it had not been returned. Not impressed - poor value for money
5
Afternoon tea for four. Excellent service, wide range of interesting food, scones perhaps a little heavy, but no quibbles about the other food on offer and more brought on request. Very good range of teas.
5
We enjoyed a lovely high tea at the Fullerton Bay. The service was outstanding. The food was delicious and continually topped up. The tea was superb and we tried several varieties. An altogether fantastic experience - a highlight of our trip!
1
The service is non existent. We are for high tea and received no service for 45 minutes. We were not sure if it was buffet, but it was. The serving tray was not straight, wobbling. There was no service tongs so you must use hands. No place for jackets. The food was hit and miss. These are small things but if you want special, small things matter. The tea was very good
5
Was lucky enough to be invited along to join some friends for Afternoon Tea. Elegant setting, very spacious and views over the Bay. There were 8 of us and we were divided up over two tables. The tables were on the small size for the amount of food and drink which we were about to receive so it was a little squashed with items on top of each other. The chairs and sofas were really comfy.The afternoon tea is served on a three tier server; top tier has chocolate cake selection, middle tier has the savoury sandwiches, mini quiches and mini bagels, the lower tier has more sweet cakes including The Lemon Tart. Along with this three tier server is a basket of warm scones, clotted cream and strawberry compoteWith all of the food there is a vast array of TWG Tea's. Too many to mention, I had the Orange Peko.As you make your way through the delicious food items the staff come around and offer you more of the sandwiches and cakes (not the scones), to be quite honest I would not have breakfast that day as this is more than enough to satisfy the biggest appetite.It was nice to have the scones served warm and with traditional clotted cream, its always disappointing when you receive fresh cream...its just not right!If you would like to add a glass of champagne this is possible and makes the whole event very extravagant.Cost $48++ for Afternoon Tea or $63++ if you would like a glass of Champagne tooI felt this afternoon tea was excellent value and extremely high quality. The mini lemon tart was to die for, thank goodness they kept bringing more!Check if they have any offers for paying with a particular credit card, we received 20% off as one of our group had just a credit card.Pro's:Value for MoneyPlenty of Food and a good selection of itemsRe-fill of Food and TeaLovely locationClotted CreamCon'sThe size of the table was too small for the amount of foodCan't wait to book again, loved it
4
Priced at 48++ per person, the afternoon is worth the price mainly because of the wide selection of TWG tea & in house coffee (you can have both or a change tea at no charge). The nicer items of the afternoon tea are mostly from the savory selection like the lobster cones, truffle egg mayo, brie cheese & jam on cracker. Frankly, the sweets are nothing to shout about. If you are looking for a nice place to chill out with your buddies on a weekend afternoon, Landing Point has a good ambience. On a sidenote, I feel that the staffs (esp at the restaurant at main hall) at the hotel are under-trained. I asked about the distinctive smell in the hotel and one of them has no idea. I managed to find it online that the smell is supposed to be a way of branding for most 5-star hotels. I guess it failed it's purpose.

Great location right on the water! Start with a choice of over 20 teas and a basket of scones. Followed by a tiered tray of assorted sweet and savory snacks individually described by the staff. Everything was absolutely delicious! AND they came around consistently replenishing as much as you wanted! Can't ask for much more than that! Highly recommend

I booked the English tea for 4 persons at The Landing Point on the day of the mid-autumn festival. The finger food was tasteless. Although there was variety, the chef evidently had a very bad day and did nothing to improve the taste. There was no freshness and subtleties of flavours in the savoury items: no "gaminess" of the parma ham, no smokiness of the salmon, the lobster mayo in the ice-cream cone had a strong fishy smell and the duck rillettes crepes were bland. The dessert items were far so sweet as to mask the other flavours and aromas that were just "screaming to be heard". The scones were hard and lack fragrance of freshly-baked confectionery. The only saving grace was the TWG tea selection. It was excellent, subtle, fragrant and light.This English Tea at The Landing Point was nowhere compared to those I tried at Scotts @ Hyatt and The Rose Garden @ Shangri-La.For the same SGD 200.00, I would rather spent it on a satisfying lunch at Tung Lok Classics @ Orchard Parade anytime

This was my 2nd visit to Landing point for their high tea. I repeatedly my visit not because it was wonderful at the first instance, but because my HSBC card had a 50% off voucher. At the discounted price, it was a prime choice as it is central and with a view. Similar to the first visit, the tray that we were served in were loop sided...pls... with such shaky trays, it doesn't live up to the image and reputation of a 5* hotel dining. Food items were the same as my first visit, average standard with some pastries worth mentioning (eclairs, lobster cones, duck roll). This buffet is priced at 45++ with around 20 selection of TWG tea. You are allowed to ask for a change (as opposed to Shangri La - Rose Veranda that comes with a charge) However, be ready to play hide and seek with the service staff... everyone seems to be frantically running around and not paying attention to diners that were waving their hands... It was observed that the bartender took on a new role as the dish washer as tea pots and glasses were stacked on the bar counter.. while he washes every single one of them... IN FRONT of diners.... and hell no will i go near the bar counter that looks like a washing bay.. see pic attached... I would never have paid this type of money for such service and food... even at half the price.. i will still have to consider... i am willing to give this place another try as promised by the General Mgr that something will be done.. i will say give this place a miss if you are looking to really chill out.. unless you have loads of money to spend and you are just contented with average food and 1 tea + a view... Let's see how this place changes in probably month to come....

The place is well located and shows a great view of MBS and old pier. A nice interior but has a weird stench once you entire, probably due to the pier. Toilets were in bad shape with "stains" on rims. Landing point charges approximately S$45++ for their high tea with only 20 TWG tea selection, while Rose Verandah in Shangri-La has over a 100. Food items were only a mere 20 and all cold. Clotted cheese for the scones contained too much blue cheese and was a bit too overwhelming. Definitely under staffed as the place was full, but had only about 6 employees, and at a certain period 4-5pm was almost down to 3! Takes 15mins to ask for refills for tea and pastries. And no last call made known to guest. By almost 5pm (though high tea was till 6pm), egg tarts and chocolate eclairs were out. A particular foreign lady hostess was also less than desirable, openly shows negative body language like rolling of eyes and etc when we asked for a change of tea or refills. A request for napkins was also forgotten and had to be reminded. Top-up of pastries were not professional, food dropped all over the table and were not cleared away and staff just "oops" and walked off. Equipment such as the tiered pastry stand were wobbly and stained with finger stains. Intolerable hygiene standards, as old dishes, glasses, cups and pots are stacked in guests' full sight right at the bar counter! Management needs to badly buck up

After walking around the river we arrived here and was greeted by a exceptionally well dress and upstanding door man even though we were dressed casual in shorts etc. We walked into the lobby and headed straight for the tea shop. This place a blast from the past, and I believe it was the Central Postoffice building when it was built. The staff were exceptional and the tea and cakes were second to none. Nothing was rushed and all the staff were truly an inspiration to the hotel. The cakes you would die for, and so was the tea served in English bone china. We spend an hour or so here and never felt uncomfortable. One day I would love to stay here in a bay view room as if the tea and cakes are anything to go by, it would be a experience to remember for a very long time
