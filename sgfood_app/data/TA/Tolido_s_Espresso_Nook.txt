Exactly what I’ve been looking for in Singapore for brunch and coffee. Very busy but worth the wait. Friendly staff, great pancakes and bacon, and a really cool atmosphere. Highly recommended.
5
Following reviews on here we decided to try this place for breakfast. Lovely pancakes with bacon and maple syrup! Very nice...
Friendly staff with pleasant service. Cheers!

Tolido’s Express Nook is THE favorite place for myself and colleagues! We enjoy the cozy atmosphere, the excellent food and service each time we are there!!
Reservations would be best, otherwise you might have to join the queue!

Tolidos offers a typical breakfast you would expect in Australia. The food was out to you very quickly only having to wait about 10-15 minutes.It was really suitable for us as it opened at 8am on weekdays and a lot of other places weren't open until 9 or later.Overall was happy with the menu and quality of the food
5
Good quality coffee near the Heritage area of Arab street. For serious coffee geeks like myself, this shop will definitely hit you right on the spot. They also have less serious drinks and food as well. Best to avoid peak hours if u would like to seat down and enjoy a good cup and just to get away from the heat.

Loved this place . Very nice cost ambience . Staff is very friendly and kind . Food is great ! Lovely pandan pancakes and fantastic waffles ! Not too heavy on the pocket too . Food seemed to be priced right and portions are good ! Visited this place for breakfast on a weekend . Be prepared to wait a few minutes to be seated . But definitely a must visit if you love waffles and a good breakfast !

We stayed in the immediate vicinity during a 2 week stay in Singapore and I spotted this little gem on the first morning out and about. It was always bustling but well worth the wait. The coffees were delicious, the staff were so friendly and helpful and the food was divine. I tried the BR Triple Egg Omelette, Croissant with Scrambled Eggs and Waffle Slammer. I will have to undertake another trip to try the rest of the menu

Ordered the ultimate combo and rosti with bratwurst, ice and hot latte. The pancakes in the ultimate combo is awesome, thick and fluffy. The sunny side up however is alright. The rosti is good. Just the right level of crispy-ness for my hubby and I. Portions are big so we couldn’t finish our meals, but we did try our best since the food taste good. Latte and ice latte is decent. Service is good! They were flexible when I made some changes to my order, and had baby chair for my 1.5yo. We sat outdoors and it wasn’t too hot around 10am. Would come back again for sure if I am in the east area. Great find
3
I was invited here for celebration. Perhaps there are not many western eateries in this part of town. To me it is rather ordinary. The food was alright, not great.The place is trying to be rough or rustic, very noisy, part self serve, crowded and popular.Unless invited, since it's not in convenient neighborhood for me (parking was difficult, most lots in area were full, full, full), I wouldn't rush back.Staff are responsive
5
This is my third time here and I simply love this place. They do really nice and yummy brunches. Especially their french toast with caramelized bananas. The prices are reasonable, service is excellent. Just need to make reservations as it's always crowded. Thumbs up
5
5 days in Singapore and luckily found Tolido's near our hotel on the first day. Perfect coffee and ambience, great food and the owners are really friendly people. So good we went back for breakfast every day, best way to start the day.
4
Tolido is a lovely place for a fulfilling breakfast and decent coffee. The atmosphere is very relaxed and cosy.
4
Nice and cosy ambiance and music inside. Very friendly staff. Good and efficient service. Not a very healthy choice.
5
I went to this place for breakfast because I had seen good reviews. The breakfast was amazing and the staff were friendly. I would definitely recommend this to family and friends.
4
Small place, not easy to locate coz it was just beneath a bridge, just slightly over the corner of the traffic light of Jl Sultan.They serve good coffee latte, big portions of french toast with bacon and truffle scrambled egg with toast plus pancake for closing.Food tastes great, except banana pancake doesn’t taste special
5
Visited here on a whim while recently in Singapore and staying nearby, and was pleasantly impressed. My meal (out of three for the order) did not arrrive and when we let staff know, they were very apologetic and gave us a round of coffees on the house to more than make up for a simple mistake. I would definitely visit again when in Singapore. One note however, you cannot use international cards in this cafe but there is a nearby ATM to withdraw Singapore dollars
5
We luckely stumbled upon this place on our first day in Singapore and have been eating breakfast here every morning sense. They have simple breakfast food but with an extra touch of awesome taste on everything. I have been eating the omelette with bread and salad, French toast (sweet) fresh pressed orange and carrot juice, pumpkin latte and peppermint ice blended mocha so far and I love it all. The prices are I would say average Singapore prices 5-7 s$ for coffee, about 10-12 s$ for the food and no service charges. The staff is really friendly! There is a couple of tables inside and outside to sit.
5
The owner has a passion for coffee and that you can taste in the coffee. Very good coffee beans they use here.The place has very friendly staff. The menu has eggs, sandwiches, pancakes, waffles and fresh juices as well.The banana pancake with syrup is highly recommended, i also tried the truffle injected scrambled eggs. All the food is good against a good price. We went here 3 times in a row to have some breakfast and coffee. Highly recommended
4
Good place for a decent coffee. As we are Melbourne people we love our coffee and this place was quite good. Just note that they do double shots so you will need to advise them if you want a single shot. Food is alright, didn’t really have standard breakfast, seemed to mix a lot of different types of food but it was decent enough to eat. Book beforehand if you want to eat here as it’s small and it gets busy
5
We only discovered Tolido's on our last morning in Singapore, otherwise we would have come here every day for breakfast or brunch. The coffee was really good (we are from Melbourne, Melbournians LOVE coffe!) and breakfasts were yummy. Between four of us we had banana pancakes, full breakfast, and something else... I can't remember now but it was all really fresh and filling. It is about a minute's walk from the Hotel Boss, so I would highly recommend getting out and eating at Tolido's if you are staying at the Boss. All with friendly service and a good price.
5
Excellent little place with a nice atmosphere. Great food and coffee. Staff are really friendly you can see why it’s so popular!
5
Awesome place , fantastic yummy food, great friendly service and great atmosphere. A perfect place to have a great breakfast before exploring Singapore. Prices are very reasonable.
5
Favourite brunch truffle scrambled eggs, 462 prawn laksa pasta and ice blended sea salt caramel latte.
4
We had a lovely lunch here. The rosti and bratwurst were particularly good.
There is a nice place to sit outside with fans or inside looked lovely with a/c.
5
Very cute place with a great vibe inside. Went with my husband and we both loved the food and the drinks. We are from the west coast of Canada and this place would be very popular back home!
5
This is one busy place. You wait to be seated, ususlly with other people sharing, it gets that crowded. The pace and atmosphere are frantic on a Saturday. It was noisy and hectic inside and not relaxing. The breakfast menu was a little too much of mixing sweet and savoury for me with no basic options of just eggs and toast or just pancakes. The coffee was delicious but super strong. $5,50 for a latte, $7,00 for a juice, $10-18 for brekkie plates. Same as Australia basically.Enjoyed the friendly service. Everyone was under 30 and on their phones, funky place, easy to find. A little bit too hectic to eat in piece. Recommended if you are in the area but not worth traveling for. Not recommended ood for kids, too crammed, no simple food options. Bill for 1 adult, 1 child came to $45. A little ouch
5
This little cafe is a blessing if you're used to the cafe scene in Sydney, Melbourne etc.....ie. they do it right. The food is funky and generous, atmosphere is cosy and friendly. If you think Starbuck's is the ultimate in coffee, do yourself a favour and get enlightened
5
I rarely write reviews but Tolido's is so worth the time to rave about them. The service here was really superb. Can't count the number of cafes I've been to where the food is decent & the service altogether poor/pretentious, and the bill afterwards leaves you feeling even worse for the value you got. Tolido's is not like that at all.The staff at Tolido's are attentive & kind and evidently enjoy what they're doing. When my latte was served, the staff apologized for a slight spill over onto the plate holder (understandable when carrying a drink that was to the brim of the cup) and asked if I would like to replace it - not once, but twice in a very genuine manner. The food (truffle scrambled eggs, squid ink pasta, pandan pancakes) were all delicious. Not to mention, their PSL is done right. THANK YOU. I've been looking forever for a cup of PSL in Singapore and Tolido's is finally the place <
5
We've frequented Tolido's since they were at the Singapore Science Center. The coffee is the best in Singapore. We initially came for the Bratwurst and Rosti but the menu has now expanded to some of the best pasta with a local twist.... the laksa and salted egg pasta is delicious. Definitely worth a try
5
Thanks to TripAdvisor reviews my partner and I decided to ay this place a visit and I'm so happy we did.First up came the fresh pressed fruit juices-a refreshing change to processed bottled juices. Then came the sea salt caramel affogato....OMG-simply amazing (a must try)I ordered the turkey ham mac n cheese and while apprehensive about turkey ham instead of bacon I shouldn't have been! Let me say I love a good mac n cheese and iI've had a few in my life, some good, some bad...this one however blew my mind....oh mon dieu!!! This one has set the bar so high for any future mac n cheeses that I actually feel sorry for any future mac n cheese's ordered!Oh, my partner ordered the eggs n salmon...I think he said it was good-sorry I was to focused on consuming every bit on my plate
5
We went there for breakfast on our last day in Singapore and the food was very good! Portions are quite big and prices very reasonable. Great selection on the menu to choose from
4
Loves the Rosti and triple deck pancake serves with Ice Cream. Value for money and Food is superlicious. Good place to catch up with BFF but it gets crowded during lunch hours.
5
Open till 6. Laid-back cafe kind of place for friends. Food was delicious. Place was crowded however, staff accommodated & served well!
5
We stayed in Hotel Destination Singapore Beach Road (10 min walk) but had our breakfast at this great place two out of three possible mornings. Not that easy to find great coffee but here you won't be disappointed.
5
We came here for breakfast and enjoyed it. The food was great, simple but really tasty.
The coffee however was excellent. Best coffee we had enjoyed in Singapore by far.
Well priced and was just short uber ride from Marina Bay.
5
On our last morning in singapur we've been having Breakfast at this restaurant!There is nothing more to say that the food was looking super-awsome and if you want to have a very good tasty "western" Breakfast this is the right location for you!--> HAVE A LOOK AT THE PHOTOS
4
Went here for brunch and it was very busy - need to book. Waited 30 minutes for a table but were given the menu while we waited. Chose our meals, but the chorizo breakfast was going to take 40 minutes to cook, so my husband chose the pancakes and I chose the french toast. The coffee was amazing - best in Singapore!!! We had to still wait for our meals and they arrived separately - one about 25 minutes and the other 35 minutes. I had ordered a side of bacon - but they forgot and it finally arrived after I had finished. The food is great - quality and quantity - very fresh, great coffee too. They need to sort out the order/delivery system though. I would come again but on a quiet day
5
We found this on tripadvisor.It is only a 10 min walk from the park royal beach rd or haji lane.Or 5 mins north up the road past the temple.The Coffee is the best we have tasted in singapore.Consistently good & hot.We had the french toast with banana & almonds again very generous & delicious.They have something to suit every taste.Breakfasts of pancakes starting at $10+ breakfast is served all day..We would recommend this to anyone looking for a great breakfast to go here.Also serve lunches & drinks.Opens 8am to 6.30pm tues to fri & 9am weekends.Closed Mondays.
5
Spent ages prior to coming to Singapore looking up the 'go to' coffee places here. After 4 disappointing visits to places that just regurgitated what others do, I stumbled over this place by accident.What a find.When tasting notes talk of cocoa and nutty flavours coming out of their beans, and not this pursuit of the fruit salad rainbow, my interest is peaked. I wasn't disappointed.Great espresso that few others are doing, and accompanied by great tasting food that is generous in its serves.Don't miss the opportunity to check this place out
3
Good food but no 'healthy' options so we were a bit disappointed.. When asking for the banana pancakes it looked like there were no banana's..only options left were waffles/eggs often accompanied with bacon and other meat.. In our opinion this one is ranked to high in tripadvisor..
5
They know how to make a great coffee. Beans are mild, nutty, rich. I just landed in this suburb of Singapore. Lonely Out in the burbs but this place makes up for it with vibe, music and aroma.
5
One of the best cups of coffee offered in the area, with a very friendly and happy staff making every visit a joy. The food is excellent and for a more sturdy breakfast than most hotels offer, Tolido's is the perfect choice.
4
I'm a fan of their truffle scrambled eggs. Their coffee is pretty decent too. Staff are generally pretty friendly as well.
5
Food was great and so were the staff. Food came out quickly. Also great atmosphere to enjoy your food
4
Tolido's offers you a great breakfast experience for a good price.
The food selection could be a bit more varied but what they have is really good so if you are lucky you will be really glad to eat there.
5
We stayed in Singapore for 3 nights and came here for brunch two times. The food here is amazing! The first time we came was on a Monday and it was absolutely packed, we had to wait about 20 mins for a table which was no problem. Second time was a lot quieter and we got a table easily. We had the banana pancakes and the ultimate combo both times as they were so so good! The strawberry and banana milkshakes are also lovely. Coffee here is great, not bitter at all so tastes really good! Prices are very reasonable for Singapore. Would 100% recommend this place, great service too!
5
Wow, what a little treasure tucked away in Jalan Sultan. 6 of us visited Singapore and Tolido's was recommended to us. So glade. Once we found this place we had to keep going back. We had breakfast at Tolido's 4 out of 5 mornings. The meals were substantial, tasty, large menu with great variety and we loved every dish we had. The coffee was great & in fact was a lot better than a lot of cafes at home. Highly recommend you go to Tolido's.
5
Coffee strong & hot. Food quick, good portions & tasty. Breakfast food mainly cooked eggs of some sort & pancakes. No fruit or grains (muesli) on breakfast menu though. Had the Norwegian smoked salmon which was yummy. Staff very friendly & accommodating with our 2 kids under 2
5
This little coffee shop was a great escape from the heat. The interior reminded me of coffee shops that you find in the Northwest. I got the affogato (ice cream with espresso). Both the coffee & ice cream were of superior quality making it a wonderful afternoon snack on a hot day
5
One wouldn't expect to find a cafe in this old HDB hood, just off the trendy Bugis/Kampong Glam area. It was more crowded that I'd thought it would be on a Sat afternoon. We had the vongole pasta and croque monsieur - both of which were excellent. A pity we couldn't use the Entertainer 1-for-1 on the breakfast items. The coffee didn't disappoint, and I'd gladly come back again to try the breakfast items. The pancakes at the next table looked delish.
5
This rather unassuming cafe actually serves good breakfast and coffee. I also like their pasta and waffles. :D
4
No stomach for desserts except for my wife. The ice blended mocha is one of the best around; not too sweet, taste just right. Hope to try other foods next time. Cozy and comfortable ambience.
4
Had breakfast with the family there and we all thought it was delicious ! Staff is nice,place is trendy and pleasant!Good selection of breakfast pancakes.
Only down side are the prices just like most places in Singapore , it's expensive !
5
Stopped over as I had just completed renewing my passport after a short walk on a humid day!
Had the salted caramel Affogato to cool me down and aid my caffeine fix.
Nice friendly Neighbourhood cafe in an ideal location!
Would be back and recommend!
5
Great location for breakfast near Arab Street. Food was really good and the coffee was excellent. Would definitely come back.
5
The best breakfast and coffee in Kampong Glam hands down. Great service and atmosphere. Interesting menu.
4
Read the reviews and decided to check it out. We arrived on a Sunday morning, and found the place full. Waiting time was long (20 min), but by then we were too lazy to go anywhere else (there aren't many options around that area and Singapore mid morning sun is not much fun), so we decided to wait. Out patience paid off. I loved their pasta (some fusion favour) and the kids loved he waffle, and they are pretty fussy about their waffle. Would recommend to check this place out if you are nearby
5
My girlfriend and I visited on the morning of the 14th of march for breakfast and were delighted by the food and cozy atmosphere. It felt like the other customers were regulars judging on their interactions with the friendly staff, which helped us feel like we'd stumbled upon a real gem. We ate the croissant with eggs, bacon and also the pancakes, with eggs, bacon and cheesy sausage. The bacon was cooked exactly how we liked it and wasn't overly fatty. The freshly squeezed Apple juice was a nice addition as well. We wouldn't change a thing about our meals, but would love to try their other options in the future. Whilst only on a whirlwind trip through Singapore, when we return we will definitely revisit Tolido's again.
5
Highlight of my brunch here with friends was the pandan pancakes, they were so light and flavoursome, topped with a vanilla bean ice cream and sweet sauce, couldn't have asked for a better way to finish off the meal.Coffee here is also good and would say overall the prices are reasonable for Singapore's brunch standards. This place is great to pop by with friends.Recommend booking a table for brunch as this place gets crowded on Saturdays/weekends
5
Had the smoked salmon and eggs. great balance on the plate. The grilled tomato was sprinkled with a touch of cheese. The mixed green salad had a touch of balsamic. And as I ate, part of my brain was giving a standing ovation. Great way to start the day
5
We came here for breakfast because i was craving bacon sausage and eggs and they had so many good options! It was very tasty and good prices too.
I also got the ice peppermint mocha delicious!
5
This place is a treasure for coffee lovers, they make great cappucinno and flat white.. Oohhh.. and they make a great pancakes as well..
5
Great coffee! Friendly staff, breakfast had many choices. They remembered our coffee choice from earlier visit!! All in all, I'd recommend this place, especially for good coffee. It's on perimeter of Malay precinct, close to several hotels.
5
2-3$ sign is misleading here as this place is quite affordable with the most expensive item in the menu being 17$. Excellent coffee and brunch menu, quick service and nice portions! Love finding little hidden gems like this!
5
Oke, for the coffee and pasta, breakfast all days, very nice place n good taste n nice people n service.
5
Ended up visiting every day of my stay as the menu was soooooo good. Amazing French toast and caramelised banana what a way to start the day!!!! Great coffee friendly staff and wifi too- perfect 😊😊
5
It can be hard to find great coffee when travelling and especially so in Singapore on a Sunday morning. We stopped here because it was the only place we saw open and we are so happy we did. The espresso was excellent and so too were the baked eggs with stripey bacon. A wonderful surprise.
5
I am so happy that we found Tolido's Espresso Nook. The place is cute as a button, trendy, comfortable and friendly. The coffee is on point - the staff is awesome, and the breakfast we had was excellent. We really enjoyed the vibe - and the laid back atmosphere. Just what the Dr. ordered while on vacation.Don't delay - go today
5
We started our day at a quaint little restaurant called Tolido's Express Nook. Andrew Adams and I went in search of Pandan pancakes and laksa and we struck gold! As an added bonus we met the chefs. One of the chef creatures is Linda Ong and she is as warm and friendly as the cozy nook she has created. What are pandan pancakes Malaysian Pandan pancakes are a wonderful treat sweetened with dark caramel flavoured Gula Melaka, Malaysian palm sugar. Why are the pancakes green? You grind up and use the leaves of the Pandanus plant to add flavor and color to pancake mix. The mix also generally has coconut milk as well. The final product is then topped with coconut ice cream if you chose the right restaurant. Today we discovered Tolido's a golden gem of a coffee and food spot. I had the Laksa which is a combination of Chinese and Malay cuisine. The dish is a spicy noodle soupish dish. Today I had the best I have had yet! Tolido's has taken a few twists with this Singapore standard and the result is delicious!If you are in Singapore, find it, order the Laksa and the Pandan pancakes and throw in a salted Carmel iced latte or a milkshake and sit back and enjoy. Tell them Tammy sent you!They are doing it right at Tolido's and I can't wait to go back. I just know there are a few more diamonds to explore on the Tolido menu and it makes me hungry just thinking about the possibilities
4
I am a brunch lover and have tried countless places in Singapore in search for good brunches that satisfy. What makes Tolido's stand out a bit is their more-than-usual extensive menu and their willingness to customise some dishes for my vegetarian husband. After going back three times, I finally know my favourites - the truffle scrambled eggs, truffle fries (apparently I like the flavour of truffles!), and the brioche French toast with caramelised bananas (to share!).The coffee is really good too and their mocha never disappoints. So is the service. Very friendly and warm, a bit of a rarity in sunny Singapore, I find.Definitely call ahead if you plan to go on a weekend since most of the good tables are reserved well in advance. The seating area is not very generous so if you have a baby or toddler, getting a table outside may be easier and better
5
Amazing coffee amazing food. Will 100% be coming back here. In fact we are meant to get the train but are going to get a taxi instead so we have more time here to order some more food!
Must visit!
5
Only stayed for coffee but loved the intimate atmosphere, good coffee and cool music. Coffee was about $5.50 which seems standard for Singapore.
4
Very crowded on weekends maybe due to the good ambience of this cafe. Food is quite nice, same goes for coffee which I presume to be yahava beans. Price is slightly higher only, but still worth it..
4
Lovely little cafe. Attentive service & good food. The pandan pancakes were particularly yummy & the cups of tea were enormous.
5
Had BT omelette with full grained bread. Very good. Coffee bean are extremely good so caffe latte was delicious. Good start of the Saturday morning.
5
The atmosphere is excellent, the breakfast delicious. Just a little bit expensive from my point of view.
You should try the eggs with salmon
5
After being disappointed in my hotels breakfast, I found this place close by and thank goodness I did. I returned 3 times to this cafe as the breakfasts were so delicious and the coffee was great. The staff were also very warm and friendly which was another reason I returned. This is a Melbourne style cafe, with great choices on the menu. Loved the banana almond french toast, the omelette and the pancakes. Prices are good, most meals around $10-15 each. If you are wanting a fantastic breakfast, then go here, you will not regret it
5
Had ice coffee sea salt mocha and flat white which both were great, coming from a coffee culture it was great to taste this in Singapore. Breakfast banana pancakes were amazing and wife had scrambled eggs which she said were excellent. In Singapore for another 2 nights and this will be out breakfast stop both days! Thankyou
4
I stumbled upon this place whilst randomly walking around town. What started as a cynical attempt to find somewhere for wifi turned into a pleasant surprise. Initially I ordered coffee, I'm no expert on coffee but it hit the spot. I also had a relatively basic american style breakfast - so waffles, bacon, eggs, maple syrup which was nicely done and produced pretty quickly. Staff were friendly, service was quick. All in all I would recommend this place if you fancy a change from the delights of Little India / chinatow
5
Passed by and went in for our weekend Brunch. This place is really a pleasant surprise as the ambience was cosy, food has a local twist. Eg: laksa pasta, pandan pancakes with gula melaka & ice-cream.We ordered the pancakes and Stout infused bacon with French toast - Yummy! Enjoyed ourselves and the good coffee!Will be back again, definitely
3
Came here for breakfast this weekend and opted for the American breakfast (egg, bacon, sausage, baked beans & toast) for about $10. Service was fast and efficient and the food was decent. Didn't try the coffee but it looked reasonable.
5
excellent service, friendly baristas & staff, great espresso & food, fun atmosphere... will definitely come back again.
5
Very nice atmosphere in the cafe. Went to have breakfast there with our kids and it was delicious! Highly recommend!
5
Great little coffee shop, when you come bring cash, for its cash only.They have some good breakfast choices, try the bacon wrapped eggs with toast and you will be looking for it everywhere you go. Can sit inside or out. Always sit out and watch the people go by. Service is good during the week but can get a little backed up on the weekend, but can expect that.If your a time, ask for their frequent coffee card.Easy walk from Hotel Boss and not to bad from Lavender Station.
5
Nice cosy cafe. the food served is great and the staff are friendly!very rustic feel about the place which will put you at ease as soon as you step in.take note of the opening hours though as they seem to close early.When you are there, some must-tried include the rosti and pandan pancake
5
Do not pay a fortune for those ridiculously overpriced hotel buffets. This place is divine, a short walk from the Parkroyal and the food and coffee is excellent. I had the truffle eggs on brioche. Excellent vibe. Hard to find good coffee when travelling. It's been 5 weeks of a lot of terrible ones but then I got this (see photo)
5
Operated by a lovely Singaporean man, this western coffee shop serves great coffee. Just down the road from Hotel Boss (which has awful buffet breakfast), we looked for an alternative and there it was. We ate pancakes, waffles and coffee for our brunch and they were yum. Service was excellent. The guy was chatty, friendly and knowledgable.
5
Located below a local residential building at the junction of South Bridge Rd & Sultan Rd, this rather small yet homely coffee & food joint is a popular food haunt with cycling enthusiasts, travelers staying at nearby boutique hotels as well as locals.Service is great although ordering is self service. The squid ink pasta is nice ... If you are into it :) ... Rosti is also great and it goes well with the warm latte crafted by the young owner.Try this place if u are around the Sultan Mosque tourist site or beach road area. Place closes at 6.30 pm. So don't be late
4
On our way from Little India to Arab Street we passed this interesting looking coffee shop that was perfectly located for a cold drink.The menu looked interesting and it was around 11:30 a.m. so we decided to stay for lunch. Order at the counter, delivered by the wait staff.Banana almond French toast and an iced mocha for one, Croque monsieur and a beer for the other. Both delightful
4
I had a flat white and was very pleased they used Yahava beans. The coffee was great, second only to Yahava. The barista was also very friendly, taking the time to explain what a kopi latte was and recommend some choice picks at the cafe. Apparently, the barista came in third at a Singapore latte art competition. As we were stuffed, we did not order any food but we saw many orders for the pandan pancake which looked sumptuous. We'll be back to try that. The place was doing a roaring trade on a Sunday afternoon.
5
Fantastic rosti, fantastic pandan pancake, fantastic coffee and barista. Really easy on the wallet, best ambience I have ever experienced in a cafe
4
Nice place to have all day breakfast or a coffee. Went here for a Sunday lunch and had a waffle with bacon. Portion size are good sized, coffee taste great and so are the ice blended ones. Free wifi and friendly staff.
5
We arrived in singapore around noon and had not eten yet. Out hotel was not that far and we really wanted a good breakfast. Tolido did not disappoint. Lot of choices (eggs, croissant, paninis, pasta, sandwich, milkshakes and good coffee) all day long!
4
Had lunch and really enjoyed the pasta recommended by their staff. The menu seems to be very limited but quality of pasta is good. They ran out of wine over the weekend so washed down lunch with a beer! Great for casual lunch!
5
We visited this place today on CNY. We ordered ;- 2 Flat White which were excellent. - Turkey Ham macaroni cheese was very good. - Truffles Fries was delicious. The decorations was very cute. The seats were comfortable. The services was very attentive and friendly. The price was fair. Total bill was 34.65 S$ (included 10% cny surcharge).
5
Excellent coffee and some nice small twists on traditional cafe fare: bacon and eggs with pancakes instead of toast for example, and prawn laksa pasta. Also has decent house wine by glass if you want something with your pasta for lunch or dinner. Quite small though and usually crowded so expect to wait at peak times, and to sit close by your neighbouring table
5
Perfect experience. Greeted immediately upon arrival. Extensive menu with all day breakfast. Excellent coffee - wish they had larger sizes. My partner had the ultimate combo and I had the truffle scrambled eggs. Quality and portion was on point and great value for money.Wifi was appreciated too as tourists with no data on our phones.Thank you Tolido'
4
Had my breakfast there today.The design of the cafe is quaint and comfortable. There is outdoor and indoor seating. Both are fine.The staffs were friendly and welcoming!The range of items were decent, desserts to mains to breakfast. Drinks selection was extensive too, coffee, tea to milkshakes.Price was acceptable. One thing I like is, portion is not extremely huge and for the price, it is comfortable. Cooking of the food was good too.I had croissant, butter was served together. It was warmed before serving so the croissant tasted crispy and fresh. My husband ordered croissant with scrambled eggs and bacon. He liked it too.Coffee was good too.Do visit this place if you are at the area.You could walk from Bugis station or perhaps take a bus. There is carpark lots available too. Not difficult to find
5
This was My second visit, first time ordered for breakfast set, came with two slices of Breads & coffee.Was worth paying.On my second visit went for the lunch , i ordered for the Pumpkin & caramelised onion sandwich, it was very nice but was not enough as a lunch.I recommend them to improve on the portion size.I also ordered for the lemongrass Ice Tea & cranberry scones.everything was very nice & worth paying.Their in house baked products are amazing.Wide varieties of cakes & cookies are available.Service & Staff are also very humble & courteous.Will always love to visit again & again.See you soon Team..!!Cheers...!!
4
Happened to find this place after tiring of exploring the neighborhood! A bit surprised at the crowd inside the cafe, especially around noon time. I like the decor, simple yet welcoming! However, I did find that the cafe was too crammed. The tables were so closed to each other that sometimes I can't help not to eavesdrop:-)The choice of food is good, from omelette, toast, waffle, pasta, etc...etc...After long consideration (because too many things I wanted to try), I decided to go ahead with the Egg omelette. Never regret my choice!For coffee, they used Yahava beans! Happened to be my fave!Overall, I am glad to stumble on this neighborhood cafe!No doubt I will try their Happy Hour on my next visit.
5
The food and drink they prepare is great. I visited many times already for their Roesti with cheese sausage.

Best espresso based coffee I've found in Singapore, perhaps Asia. Barista really knows his craft. Coffee really well made, brewed perfectly.
On my second visit they remembered my order.
One for the aficionados.

Cute fit out. Great food. Friendly waiters. Chilled atmosphere! Good to get away from the hustle and bustle with westernised food:)

I've been here many times and love the coffee and food. Must try items - crossiant with scramble eggs and banana pancakes. My favorite coffee here is flat white which comes with pretty latte art! Prices are pretty reasonable.

We trapsed around Singapore trying quite a few of the different espresso coffee shops - and this was by far the best.

Went here for a quick bite to eat and was really surprised at just how nice this place was! Food was amazing, customer service was great, the decor and the vibe were spot on and great music was playing in the background. One of the best cafes I've been too

As I was staying in Singapore for a couple of nights, I came across this cafe since I was staying in a nearby hotel. Food was well prepared and the coffee was well made. Love the interior too! Good place to meet up with your mates or you can just come here solo and enjoy a cuppa (just like me!)

a cosy but cramped cafe with a good brunch menu. the ambience is really comfortable for a nice meal. lots to look and see with regards to the interior as it's stuffed with items in all corners. but if you're claustrophobic, maybe you should avoid sitting inside

i go here quite often and always enjoy excellent service. the food is prepared well and arrives quickly at your table.after a few places i've been here in the past few month's this one is certainly one of the best!and if you go there, do try there pasta (mac&cheese is my favourite

I have to admit this place wasn't the easiest to find but the food is good and it comes out very quick after you order even when it's a full house! We ordered the tolido pancakes and 3 egg omelette. The bacon was so good! Need more of that! The pancakes are so light and fluffy! Def a treat for me! The 3Egg omelettes are also very fluffy and almost liquidy on the inside!Update 26th sept 2014: so now that it's my 3rd time here. I decided to try the ultimate combo and it's delicious! The bacon smelt so good, it would make anyone hungry! The pancakes were just as good.. They may look like normal pancakes but just wait till you put them into your mouth! It's so fluffy and tasty!! The Rosti with cheese sausages for $12.90 is a good price and the Rosti is delish! I did have to tell them to cook with less oil as the last time I had it. My plate was flooded with a layer of oil... I need to visit here more often to checkout more menu items like the cereal bacon! :
