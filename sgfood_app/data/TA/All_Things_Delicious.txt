The place is small but very cosy. The set up is simple but elegant. Very friendly staff and good coffee. Love to come back!

Small but a very cosy and quaint place.
There are all-day breakfast, desserts, pasta to name a few.
I got the Nourishing Breakfast. Crabmeat aerved with salad and Lemongrass Tea. Very nice indeed.
My friends ate Hearty Breakfast and Shakhouska.

The place was small yet comfy and clean. The breakfast we had were absolutely delicious and kept us filled until mid afternoon. Would definitely come back.

Loved the front where they had lots of little christmas baked goods on sale. But wow, expensive. 7 or 8 inch whole cake for $85++?! I get that this is Singapore but it's very expensive.I may be biased but whilst the cafe is nice (air con is very cold though) and the coffee was good...the menu is a let down as with many similar places around Singapore. Nothing special about it although lots of choice. It doesn't come out looking that great either. Juice options were orange and pineapple. Pet peeve of mine around Singapore is that places who put their air con on too cold (like 17 degrees) makes the food unappetizing as it cools down too quickly

Came back here again this week for another of the salmon rice bowl. My lunch companion opted for the rice bowl with the lamb pieces. We were both very happy with the quality of the food. Service very efficient too. A little noisy inside if there are a lot of people (as mostly seems to be the case here)

Cafe is located at Arab Street and is just walking distance from Masjid Sultan. Definitely a plus plus points for the Muslim wife or girlfriend who wants to wait for their significant other to do their Friday prayers! Cafe was very peaceful and spacious! Food was delicious, but a bit pricey for my liking

This is the second time I am patronising this cafe, after having tasted the food and experienced the wonderful service previously. For lunch, I ordered a rice bowl; the soy-glazed salmon with fresh avocado, cherry tomatoes, braised shimeiji and boiled egg on Japanese rice. For dessert, I had the signature dessert, sticky salted caramel pudding. The lemongrass and pandan infusion tea washed down the meal. The food was superb. The service staff was great too, especially Wan; who graciously offered me a table though I was an hour early on my reservation. Wan also remembered me from the last time I was there and called me by name.Well done, Wan; keep up your fantastic service

Although we were early by an hour and was more than willing to return later, a table was immediately made available to us. Staff member Wan very nicely brought us to a table recently vacated but switched us to a slightly larger one further in. Another plus point is the WiFi connection. Once again, Wan obliged with the password.Lunch started off with 2 slices of Sourdough Toast with Jam and Butter. The bread was lightly toasted with a tinge of sourness. The main was the Chicken Tikka Rice Bowl, so filling with loads of accompaniments. One should go the front of the cafe where cakes and tarts await. I opt for a slice of Earl Grey Loaf and washed down the meal with a pot of hot Lemongrass and Pandan Infusion Tea.A great meal overall coupled with fine service
