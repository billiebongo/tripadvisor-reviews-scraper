Very nice, tasty and well presented Italian food. The staff is very service minded and very kind. We sat out-door by the waterfront - very nice ambiance. We will certainly return.

Never dissapoints - great food with great service. Ambience is nice, with lovely views. You are able to sit outside weather permitting.

Loved the bread & matcha creme brulee! Food was so-so, had the duck with spices & mud crab tagliolini. Portions are tiny.

After a major mixup with our reservations on our part on Sg50, they did all they could to get us into the restaraunt. Very accommodating to make things different for the kids on a busy night also. Good food and good atmosphere.

I realised that Procacci has been changed to Nuvo, and it was a big confusing. The menu was quite different. The cold pasta with caviar was disappointing, the mushroom soup was ok. But we both enjoyed the main course - cod fish and the lamb dish. Overall, the dining experience was just ok. The service was so so, the waiters was not that helpful. The view was still beautiful. I am not sure if I would go back there...

We went for a work lunch and decided to order a la carte rather than the set lunch. The portion sizes for the main meals were very small - my cod was tiny but the Salmon was a bit more filling as it was served with potatoes. Service was with an attitude. I hadn't been to Procacci for a while - overall I wasn't impressed as the service levels have dropped.

Lunch with client and colleagues. Geat location and views. Surprisingly only half filled for a weekday when it's located in teh CBD. Food was not too bad but the service was pretty bad. There were only 2 waiters taking orders and it took ages to attract their attention. Refilling of glasses with water wasn't automatic and it took them 20 minutes after they had served one dessert and the coffees and teas to serve the remaining desserts and only after being reminded to do so. The bill also took ages to come and also after being reminded to do so

The service in the restaurant was faultless. We sat outside on the terrace overlooking the Marina Bay Sands hotel (ugly, but not the fault of the restaurant!!!). The staff were very helpful and the chef came out to speak about allergies, and gave me confidence that he had things under control, which was much appreciated. The food was very good. It wasn't cheap, but was worth it

Set out on Customs Quay on the opposite side of the Marina from the MBS Procacci is a super place to have lunch or dinner and take in some of Singapore's dramatic views.My daughters and I stopped off here for dinner last evening.We were welcomed like old friends (rather than the occasional visitor that I am) given a table overlooking the marina and looked after perfectly.The Lobster Ravioli was superb, the shredded crab pasta in white wine sauce just right and even my youngest' panini was a little special.Thanks team. Another winner.Nic

Was so looking forward to trying Procacci and we had a chance to go for a friends birthday lunch. The setting was lovely. The service was terrible. The food - not much better. Though we ordered from the set lunch menu, I didn't expect to have steak as tough as shoe leather (really? - serve chicken instead if not serving a decent cut of beef). I was so disappointed. We had to flag down the wait staff several times for service, from water, to ordering wine, to obtaining our bill (really?). So 'get with the programme' owner/management of Procacci - it's survival of the fittest out there in restaurant land. The only saving grace on the day was the view of the harbour

We got a table right at the water with spectacular view of the MB inclusive it's great laser shows. Food was excellent, steak super tender and the wine selection was great as well. Will be back when back in SG ...

located near the bay, very calm and peacuful terrace... they offer nice italian wine at very reasonable prices... the service staff are very friendly and efficient... it is a great place for an after work drink if u r in the area.

This venue serves decent authentic Italian food in the CBD. Ideal for a business meeting. Atmosphere is ok, but nothing special. Service is very good. A bit pricey for what you get.

Been there last week after leaving from our hotel (Marina Bay Sands) and walked all the way round. Past from a lot of restaurants that were packed with people so we ended up there as there where not many options left. We ordered two salads and kalamari to share as starters and 6 main dishes. All 9 plates that came to our table were ridiculously small that might have been ok for an eight year old child but not for adults. Taste was ok but nothing special. We also had 2 bottles of wine. I could have given some plus points for the location but as there are so many options at the area it doesn't make it unique. The price was 516 S$. For those who visit Singapore know that is one of the most expensive places you can go. It doesn't make wright though to cheat people like that. With a minimum cost from the restaurant, customers could been much more satisfied

Made a reservation a month back for a birthday celebration at the restaurant on the second day of Chinese New Year. With less than a week, the restaurant called to say they are closed and has to cancel my reservation. They can't give reason for closing and said they made a mistake. They are open on the first day of Chinese New Year though but can't explain why they are closed on the second day and informed customers so late. Very unprofessional and unethical. I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone

We decided to have our dinner here because we are from Florence, where Procacci born long time ago. We had a look at the menu and frankly we had the feeling that we could eat well. Dinner was good, based on fish. Like in high quality restaurant, price is quite high but if you are there, you can have this type of dinner surely

It might as well be the best Italian meal we had in Singapore. We skipped starters, as usual, and went ahead with the mains. I had Tagliatelle ai Gamberoni and my boyfriend had the daily special of Lobster pasta in light pomodoro sauce. Both are really good. Serving portions are just nice -- we still had room for dessert -- Tiramisu and molten lava cake.We spent almost as much as what we usually spend at restaurants in Boat Quay. The small difference is we really loved the food!Service is superb. The wait staff were attentive and food came at appropriate timing. It was such a nice way to end a toxic weekend in the office. Oh, yes, the ambiance is great

There is nothing nice I can say about this restaurant. The food was not good and way overpriced. The entrees were reminiscent of airplane food (actually the steak I had on Singapore Airlines was better!). I would save your money and time. If you want a nice view, Pelican at One Fullerton is a good alternative
2
We spend New Year's Eve here as it has a fantastic, front row seat of Marina Bay and the fireworks.So, a great location but they really know how to under-play their location. The meal was bland (set menu for NYE) and ZERO atmosphere, just a bunch of guys hanging-out waiting for midnight and the fireworks.Nothing special at all except the view, it is sad because they could have done SO much better considering their prime locatio

Yes this is a bit expensive for what it is (reasonable Italian fare) but worth it just the once for the view of the light show from Marina Bay Sands at 8 and 9.30pm every evening. Ask to sit outside at a table overlooking the water, then sit, sip your glass of Prosecco and enjoy!That said, the food was pretty good too. If you want to keep the cost down order two starters - they are fairly large unless you're used to American portions, and fill up on the very good focaccia. The waiters were great and even gave me a glass of prosecco for free, so drink relax and chill. Apart from the view you could almost be in Italy

Cons: rip off, random pasta, pretentious.
Pros: nice view.
The only good thing about it is the view. All the rest is mediocre. Overpriced pasta. They charged us more than US$20 in glasses of water. Ridiculous.
2
If you are hungry or starving, dont think of going here.. Service is really slow and finding veg food within the menu is not possible..

Ate dinner whilst watching the light show from the Marina Bay Sands Hotel. The food was delicious, great choice of starters and main courses, well cooked and nicely presented.

Sat by the waterfront, enjoying the breeze with every tasty bite ! The service staff are friendly, fun and knowledgeable.

We have been going there since we arrived in Singapore in 2011 with friends or for business dinners. It is so far the best rapport quality and price we found - excellent food , very good service, fantastic view including the MBS light and sound show every evening and nice fresh breeze. Two down sides - the noise generated by the music from the Kinky ( bar on the roof terrace) and the shared toilet facilities

Went to Procacci for lunch and knowing the Procacci from Florence, i was a bit surprised as in Italy is more like a wine bar and shop. But i have to say the food was tasty, a bit pricy but worth every $. the service was very attentive and fast, the sizes of wine served very generous. very good coffee to finish off, i'll be back in the evening as then you can sit outdoors

Had dinner at Procacci on a weekday evening in a group of 5 people. Overall I would not recommend the restaurant to others, there is better Italian elsewhere in the city.The atmosphere is nice, Procacci is a fancier place with a nice set-up for dining. Service is average, they have plenty of people walking around however I did not get a refill of water once during the course of dinner. On top of that, some people were done eating their main before I even got mine (glad they didn't wait or it would have been cold!)The food itself does not impress, I had the beef carpaccio which seemed like it was of high quality, however the overall blend of flavours did not do it for me. I also ate the Black Angus tenderloin, which was cooked properly, meat was good quality, but otherwise very bland.Food was also relatively expensive (~35++ for the carpaccio and ~50++ for the steak). Could be that I ordered the wrong items, however this restaurant won't be at the top of my list

Found this little gem sometime ago but would like to write about them now. Have been there plenty of times but what capture me is the service which is very consistent! Have gone through a few change of Chefs but food was good as always. The terrace seatings is perfect even for a glass of wine or a group celebrating any occasion. Would recommend this to anyone who loves to chill with a glass of wine and a good view, as for service - I'm sure you'll be taken care of pretty well by the excellent service staffs

I have enjoyed 3 dinners here, including romantic for 2 and group of 5 and have enjoyed every one. The food, typical Tuscan faire, is consistently good following a traditional Italian menu of hot or cold appetizers, pasta courses, mains and deserts. The antipasto platter for sharing and the eggplant parmesan aee highly recommended, but all are good starters. Pork chop, steaks and other grills well prepared, and the lamb is succulent and beautifully flavored. Several excellent fish dishes, with subtle mediterranean herbs and spices. The pastas served al dente and the risotto nicely done and not too rich. Solid wine list with good Italian selectionMost importantly the staff are very attentive, friendly and helpful. Braccha the manager greeted me personally on my 3rd return visit. Placed strategically at the end of the Quayside of Customs House there are great views of the Marina, with preferred seating outside. Inside is simply decorated, with the single drawback of being too cold. Good for couples, business and friends. The cost is 4-5 star, but fully on par with the other restaurants all around the Marina. You get good quality for your money unlike some others

A good friend of mine took me to lunch here. A wonderful setting with great views. The service was very good and the dish I chose (penne salmon) was tasty, wel presented and of just the right quantity. The restaurant seems quite popular with locals which is always a good indication of quality. Reasonably priced for Singapore. I will certainly return when I next visit Singapore.
