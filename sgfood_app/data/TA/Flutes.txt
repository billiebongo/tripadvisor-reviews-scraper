Situated in the National Museum, this would seem to be a perfect lunch time pit stop from your cultural exertions. The fixed price menu had some spectacular options. The portions are small, but well presented and wonderfully flavoursome. Well worth a visit.
5
I love the ambiance. Very fresh on the eyes. Service was very good as well. Menu had everything. Too bad wasnt able to try the dessert but am pretty sure it was excellet as well. Portions were just right.
5
Thoroughly enjoyed a wonderful culinary experience amidst lovely setting @ tended to very efficient staff!
4
As usual the ambience was nice with modern artistic feel to it. But the menu itself was a tad lacklustre. Was expecting a new year menu.
4
We went for Xmas lunch. The room was lovely, the service was great, friendly helpful staff, lovely food. The meat was a little cold but delicious.
4
we went there for birthday celebration. they got event outside. but they arranged us in another small room. only 2 of us. quite and good. the set worth the value
5
We ate at Flutes and enjoyed the amazing Degustation 5 course dinner menu. All courses were delicious. The food was really fresh and service was outstanding. We also felt value for money, and the quiet, elegant ambiance just added to our stunning dinner evening. Thank you Flutes, We Will Be Back
5
Was there for my wife's birthday. Good experience there. It's not one of the gigantic, fancy place but just right size of very quiet venue next to National Museum. The volume of the food was just right size to enjoy food. On top, the demonstration of desert was nice for birthday gift. Would definitely visit again.
5
On our second attempt we could get a table here as the place is popular. The ambiance is beautiful, nice music and excellent service. The food quality was superb. We took oysters, fous gras and cod. Everything was cooked to perfection and presented nicely. We wished fois gras was bigger size but it was still delicious. Their rosÃ© champagne was excellent. We got complimentary dessert which was also delicious. Strongly recommended for food quality and ambiance
5
We had dinner there last week. The restaurant is inside the National Museum which is worth visiting on its own. The restaurant tables were nicely spaced and the ambiance was just right. The food was excellent. I would say mid to upper range for fine dining but well worth it. Best to reserve. Certainly we would go back again
5
Booked a table to celebrate a family birthday. Beautiful food, staff and restaurant. Highly recommend.
5
The business lunch is a great option if you feel like having a high quality but great value lunch at Flutes. Plenty of selection, good wines on offer and fantastic service.
5
My husband and I visited Flutes for his birthday celebration and were blown away by the quality of service, food and ambience. They made this day really special for us! Price-wise is pretty reasonable for the quality of food served. Would definitely go back!
4
We had lunch with our business partners. The interior and ambience matches the museum very well. Service was excellent. The staff doesn't intrude but is always quick to respond when you need them, and they remember your orders well. We had the executive lunch menu which had a good variety. The scallops and sticky date pudding were delicious but personally I found the duck confit slightly salty and the risotto was weird. Overall, everyone enjoyed the courses they chose
5
I wish to commend the team at Flutes, led by Ruth, Ali and Sazali and the whole service staff for their excellent planning and service which made my corporate dinner event for 80 pax at Flutes a success! Ruth was my first point of contact and liaising with her made me feel like I was working with a friend - she made things so simple, easy and stress-free. I can understand why so many of her customers have chosen Flutes as their venue for their celebratory meals, for Ruth’s excellent service if not for the lovely venue. On the day of the dinner, Ali and Sazali were very warm and attentive in attending to my 80 guests in both our cocktails segment, dinner segment as well as post dinner drinks. Several of our business partners have informed me separately after the dinner that they enjoyed the service and complimented Ali and Sazali for their outstanding service. Our event was meant to wrap up by 11pm but Ali and Sazali were really understanding and kind in allowing us to stay until 11.50pm even though that meant they had to stay back later in cleaning up and turning around the venue for a 9am booking the next day. Thank you Ruth, Ali, Sazali and the Flutes team for making our event so memorable and enjoyable
5
I can say hands down and my husband agrees the best overall dining experience in Singapore. My first dining experience at Flutes was for a friends baby shower where she had hired out the private dining room. The food, ambience and service was exceptional, something I had given up on after having lived in Singapore for 4+ years. I have since returned with friends, as a couple as well as with my children aged 8+10 years and I still can not fault anything. I can highly recommend trying their 2 or 3 course lunch specials during the week. If you like white tablecloth dining, exceptional service, modern cuisine and friendly faces this is the place for YOU

I remember the old Flutes (the-now Lewin Terrace). Had many wonderful meals there - from client Christmas lunches to birthday dinners to random non-occasions. Didn’t know that they had moved to the Museum till I spotted it a week ago so decided to revisit the old haunt.Place is a lil too bright now but won’t quibble. The quirky paintings like Queen E in a Superman suit add the requisite polite humour. But we are here for the food so let’s get on with it.Soup was some Queen soup - radioactive green with salmon tartare and cream. Not bad when stirred it well. Mains was shared - wholegrain pumpkin risotto and barramundi. Risotto was a pleasant change fromthe usual mushroom/squid ink etc; and healthy too. The barramundi was cooked well and served in a charred leek which was a highlight. Liked that a lot. Dessert was again shared - panna cotta with very generous serving of berries and a chocolate hazelnut trio which was an absolute winner! It deserves the ultimate compliment - worth going back for. And I guess I’m going to sooner than later
4
This was the first time we have visited since Flutes changed location and whist the food was just as good as it always has been and the service friendly and efficient, the new location lacks atmosphere and ambience. I think it is probably that the space has such high ceilings, which makes it difficult to make the setting feel cosy and intimate. On the evening we dined, there was a large party - a business dinner I think - in the main dining room, so we were in the private dining room with approx. ten other diners and even in this smaller room, there was little atmosphere.Sadly, we were so disappointed by the change, I think it is unlikely we will be making a return visit
5
It was our 46th wedding anniversary on the 30th and first time in Singapore and we are very happy that we chose Flutes for our evening (despite our problems getting there in the storm on Monday night).Again thank you - would highly recommend Flutes to any one who appreciates fine dining.The museum is also a fine building and exhibition
5
We went here for my dad's birthday. It is located in sg's national museum. We went there for brunch. We ordered the roast (steak, veggies, yorkshire pudding). The food here is excellent and they even offer refill on the steak's jus. We also ordered pancakes and they were yummy. What makes this place even better is its staff. It has many filipino servers and they were solicitous. The restaurant even prepared a birthday dessert for my dad with a yummy pudding, wc they comped for us. They also comped my brother and dad's second glasses of wine. This restaurant really made my dad's birthday really special. I will definitely come bac
5
nice food, brillant atmosphere and a perfect service, we were placed in the small and familiar wine room, I liked it very much because there are just five tables
5
Amazing building ! Amazing food ! Amazing service ! My wife is gluten free and they were very helpful. We had a great evening !
5
Very quiet with only 2 other tables in the restaurant. Service staff was courteous and attentive throughout the whole dinner. Food was nicely decorated and fresh. Dinner was pricy.
5
Very good service and very nice ambiance. Service was very good also. Still water cost 9 dollars which is very pricey.
5
Visited Flutes a week ago for my boyfriend's birthday brunch. The service was good from the start and the overall environment was a great place to chill at. We ordered the Salmon Fillet and Eggs Benedict, and not only did the food presentation look good, they tasted really good as well! We'll definitely be back for more
5
Another visit to the Flutes and once again it was such a positive experience!We had a Duck Rillettes to share whilst waiting for friends to arrive and it delicious. Main course choices for us this day was the Burger, Roast Beef, and a Wagyu Striplion. We finished this off with some deserts and everything absolutely hit the spot!Service was super attentive, yet un-obstructive. Ali was superb with his knowledge of wines and getting the right pairing done for us
5
We had a most delightful evening at Flutes during a short holiday in Singapore. A group of 4 people celebrated a finish to a catch up in Singapore. I have been previously to Flutes with family so was keen to return. One visit was when Flutes was located in Fort Canning/ Botanical Gardens. We had a fantastic evening the food amazing and great value. The service impeccable our wait person Juan so professional and attentive but also discrete. We were trying to work out a dessert and as Juan was aware we had been before organised a delicious tasting plate of 4 desserts. With the words in chocolate "welcome back" on our plate an emotional memory of a previous family visit as my dad had recently passed away and he loved his dining experience at Flutes. Thanks so much for the wonderful dining experience and look forward to returning on our next journey to Singapore
5
Visiting Singapore with a group of friends. We stopped for lunch after touring the museum. What a good choice! They had a set menu that cost I believe around $35. It was EXCELLENT. Food was tasty and the presentation amazing. Do stop if you are at the museum (or even if you are not!
5
I went there to celebrate my partner's birthday and was a bit surprised to find that the restaurant was booked out for an event. Thankfully, I had made a reseravtion so they sat us in the private room round the back, which made for a very nice cosy setting. The service at Flutes was impeccable. As we were in the private room, I was prepared to have some trouble getting wait staff's attention (as is usual other restaurants in Singapore nowadays), but I was pleasantly surprised to see that our waiter was present at the corner of the room throughout our dinner service. He was very attentive to the small things like refilling our water glasses, clearing dishes quickly etc. The other service staff were also very attentive and friendly. At the end of the meal, they also prepared an extra little cake on top of our set dessert! The dessert cake came with one candle and a birthday wish~ very nice gesture. The food was a little pricey but good. The beef tartare and the fish stood out for us. I would recommend this place if you're celebrating an event and you don't mind paying a little extra for the very good atmosphere and service
4
Made a reservation through Chope reservation, after the reservation is confirmed the staff still sending a msg personally to double confirm the reservation and asking for any special request.this is so sweet.They serve and present foods in a fine dining way, yet the price is just like a casual or semi fine dine price.it's impressive..I requested to write a happy birthday wording on the plate of dessert that we ordered..and they still give us an extra complimentary cake in the same plate that we don't expected. It was a surprise.Staffs are so friendly and acting fast when you wave at them. It's a great place to celebrate for couples..it's quiet, and the lighting make it looks so romantic, it's a restaurant that in the building of national museum of Singapore,so the feeling is there. And can take photo outside the building which is look so pretty in the night
5
Highly attentive service yet non intrusive! And similarly high standard of food well worth the money!
5
It was an excellent dining experience. Food was great, service was excellent and ambience was amazing. Perfect for my meeting
4
Dinner was good. Ambience was great. Service was there. Pricing a bit high though not excessively. Can improve on food quality.
4
As part of the Singapore Night Festival the establishment could only serve the set menu which turned out to be very tasty.
5
Nice ambience, attentive staff, best foie gras i've ever tasted ... AC too cold, but that's the usual thing in Singapore ...
4
Booked a table here for my partner's birthday dinner and it was a wonderful experience for the both of us. It was a quiet Friday evening and the servers were very attentive. Our glasses of water were filled up very promptly. The restaurant also prepared dessert with the words "happy birthday" written on the plate in chocolate sauce. Food was above average (highly recommend the scallop dish!). This restaurant is definitely a good pick if you're lookinh for a quiet romantic night
4
A party of ten went to the Flutes for a birthday brunch celebration on 1 September 2017. We arrived about 11am and we had a nice long table with a very good view of the entire restaurant. Perhaps it was because it was a public holiday and the beginning of school holidays, many people were out of town, we were the only patrons there for a good one to two hours before another family arrived for lunch. The food and ambience was very good. We felt very comfortable and had a wonderful and memorable birthday brunch celebration for my sister and cousin
5
This wonderful restaurant in the National Museum serve a high quality food with friendly staff.They even surprised Alice with a special birthday arrangement :-). Many thanks to the team.I can really recommend this restaurant and will come back next time we stay in Singapore
4
Just short of a 5, based on two separate lunchtime visits. It's a lovely room, the service is excellent, and the set lunch menu is good value. I was not overwhelmed by the foie gras or the tuna tataki appetizers this time, the soup and the cold fish appetizer were better last time, but the duck and fish main courses were excellent, as was the cheese course (blue). The carrot cake was on the dry side and not very interesting, but the accompanying sesame ice cream was interesting and delicious (even though it also did not really go with the carrot cake). Will definitely be back.
4
The whole visit was very far from being fluent, everything was a little bumpy. There was a private event, so we were seated in the private dining room, but we were escorted there through the back and through the outside, which felt like they were sneaking us in (I booked a table couple of days prior to coming). The room was too brightly lit for a restaurant. The wine in the wine list does not match the actual selection, the years are off. The restaurant closes at 10pm on weekdays, quite early I'd say. The bathroom is like a mile away.All this is minor, but it adds up to a so-so experience. Other than that, the food was good, the service was okay, the wine was fine. However, this is not the restaurant you go just for food, this is the type of place you go for a full package of experience. Our package was not full
5
Nice executive lunch, the service was a good as our first time there. We try to dine at Flutes whenever possible when my husband is back from a trip.
5
Excellent service and food. My family was there for lunch and also to celebrate my birthday in advance. Really appreciated for the little surprised.
5
Was lucky enough to be invited for dinner at Flutes while in Singapore. I have food allergies, but the kitchen at Flutes managed this easily. Very attentive staff, always at hand to fill your glass and offer advice. Dress code: Smart (no shorts).
5
The restaurant is nicely tucked away in a quiet place in town. Especially serene in the evening.
The servers were prompt & polite. Ordered Pan Fried Foie Gras, Angus Beef Tenderloin & Chilli Crab Pasta. All was delicious.
Would definitely go back again.
5
We have been visiting Flutes for the last four years they have never failed to disappoint.
Their food is of excellent quality and their service very impressive.
4
Food was well prepared tasted delicious and the restaurant was perfect if looking for a quiet intimate setting. Quiter than you expect for a Saturday night all the same but that may because there was a lot going on in other parts of the city that night. The service was really good and they looked after us vey well. We left the restaurant fully satusfied after a great meal! Than you!
5
We were the only couple there as expected on a Monday evening. Staff were really attentive, spot on. We took the set menu and had wine. Food was really good, presented tastefully. Ambience was great. It's a lovely colonial feel so the whole experience was excellent. Cant fault any service/food areas!Definitely go back again
3
Location is great and also the way they present the food is great, wine choice excellent...but with the two dishes i had for lunch not all was as expected. I ordered the buratta and to me it was more mozarella. I ordered the salmon and for sure it was not fresh and/or not fresh. More people in the same group had the feeling on the salmon. Conclusion a lot of potential, but all food need to be great
5
We were seated in the private dining room as there was a company event occupying the main dining hall. The room was cosy and decorated with curated pieces of paintings. We instantly fell in love with the setting and atmosphere. Hadi, having many years of experience in the F&B industry, is very attentive and provided us with informed choices regarding the menu. He even had a personalised arrangement for me, the birthday girl. We enjoyed the food and would rate it above average amongst the fine dinings we have been to. This is a place I will recommend.
5
Made a reservation online to arrange the dinner to celebrate my wife's birthday. Booking was smooth.The restaurant is located in the Singapore national museum. The dÃ©cor is classy and give a "relaxing" feel. Service is good where the waiters are all very attentive. Always ready to attend to you.Pan Fried Foie Gras is nicely done. The chilli crab pasta sauce tasted very close to the real deal. Personally like this dish a lot. Also ordered Angus beef tenderloin (middle rare) but find there is still room for improvement. Find that it is a bit dry for a middle rare cooked tenderloin. Chocolate fondant tartlet is superb. Chocolate sauce in the tartlet is smooth and not too sweet. They also give us a complimentary dessert with candle and birthday message nicely "written" on the plate.Overall had a very nice experience and my wife was happy. A happy wife means a happy husband!
3
Great food and nice place for a good dinner, main course is good and the dessert was very nice. Overall experience is good.
5
Excellent restaurant for anniversaries and business. Great food and wine. Very reasonable price for the quality of food and wine and ambience
5
I went to the museum (which also highly recommend!) then had executive lunch there!
Beautiful and elegant restaurant! Great attentive services, delectable foods and ambient atmosphere :) Very pleasant experience!
5
Flutes is the best restaurant in Singapore for service, ambiance and food.
Try it - you will love it
4
Great service, great food, great chef in an elegant setting for a special dining occasion. Exquisite attention to details by those running the restaurant can be seen and experienced throughout the dining adventure.
5
We haven't been to Flutes since it relocated to Fort Canning. It was a great experience that lived up to our expectations. Amazing lamb rack and very reasonably priced wine selection.
The service was attentive without being too hovering. I would definitely recommend it.
5
After a stroll through the museum, I found flutes. they only had 1-four top left and they were reluctant to seat me as a single but all worked out. You can get a 2 or 3 course lunch with a 2 course wine pairing (saving a few dollar). YOu have 3-4 sections of starters and mains and the wine pairing from their glass menu is nicely done. I had a glass of reisling with my shrimp in laksa sauce and a NZ pinot noir with my delicious lamb loin. Service was exceptional
5
I booked this restaurant to celebrate our wedding anniversary having read the many great reviews and were extremely impressed by both the quality of the food and the excellent customer service.When we arrived there was a large celebratory dinner on the adjoining tables and they were causing a little too much noise. Without us needing to ask, the head waiter intuitively asked if we would like to be seated in their private dining room.We ordered the 1kg beef to share and it was cooked to perfection. To top off a perfect night we were given a complimentary dessert with happy anniversary written on it!Faultless- and this is from somebody who is rarely complimentary of service standards received elsewhere
5
We booked last minute for a table at Flutes based on the trip advisor reviews. We were only staying in Singapore for one evening on our way back home from honeymoon in Thailand. I booked through Chope and was greeted with a "Hello Mr. P***" on arrival. We had a lovely table and the waiters were very friendly and attentive. Overall the food was sublime. Excellent service and an amazing building to have a restaurant! Really cannot recommend this place enough! One of the best meals we've had
4
The ambience and service was top notch. It more than made up for the uninspiring menu and food. The starters were decent and foie gras was good but the steak disappointed. The portion was small and it turned out medium done when we ordered medium rare. This is a classy place to host and the food is not bad, but not quite the impressive dining experience you expect for the price
4
We had lunch here after going round the museum. Very attentive staff and tasty, well cooked food. We shared a cheese platter after the main course and it was also very good. Would certainly return.
4
Food was very well presented; staff were attentive. Upon finding out we were celebrating my birthday they made up a platter with the two desserts we'd ordered, added in a third, with Happy Birthday written in chocolate, which was a nice touch. Great ambience too!
5
Went there for my birthday brunch. The atmosphere and the servic were fabulous but the food is really average.
3
The cote de beouf was below average. The dessert was great.... The cote de beouf was really below average. The dessert was really great....
3
Its a gathering event.. nice ambience and good service.. but the food is below our expectation for the price we paid. Dont think will go back again for food may just for chill out.
5
Staff were polite and paid attention to detail, without being too intrusive. Food was promptly prepared and presented nicely.
4
Flutes at the National Museum is a beautiful place. It has an open space, high ceiling, and tasteful decoration. The sunlight beaming through the large windows makes the dinning room magical.The bar has a wide range of cocktails made to order.A long time ago the restaurant used to do Sunday Roasts with the carving of the meat in front of you however they no longer do it, which was missed.The choices of dishes from the menu were a bit limited and lacked refreshing, which I felt needed to improve to keep loyal patrons coming back.Overall it's a beautiful place that has the ingredients to make it a wonderful experience
4
Last time I visited the NMS entry was free. That seemed reasonable as most of the exhibits are just propaganda. Well they now charge $15 and the exhibits haven't changed much. We planned a quick lunch at the NMS cafe. However, be warned, it is expensive and the service is about the worst you will find. We finally managed to drag a waiter to our table, only to be told that they don't serve the burgers on the weekend. When we enquired why, and got only a blank stare in return, we got up and left. Fortunately, as we walked out we passed by Flutes and decided to look in - the best thing we did all day. The service is friendly and helpful and the food is great. As it was lunch we only had mains and dessert. The menu is not huge but has enough interesting items to make selection difficult. The Cheeseburger was the pick of the mains although the Barramundi was also good. For dessert the Carrot Cake is recommended and the Pannacotta was also good. Prices are reasonable particularly given the very pleasant setting of the restaurant. Best of all, after a couple of glasses of good Prosecco, the NMS exhibits were much more enjoyable. We will be coming back for dinned in the near future
5
Had the set lunch here while viewing the William Farquhar collection in the National Museum. Made a reservation through Quandoo, was smilingly and warmly welcomed by wait staff and shown to a table with a view of the front lawn. Both of us chose the halibut and mussels stew with giant couscous, absolutely delicious with hint of wine in the flavoring, tender and done just right especially the juicy mussels. A couple of prawns was also in the stew. My friend's pea soup was exquisitely perfumed with truffle oil and slivers of crabmeat were fresh. My appetizer was the heavenly Atlantic scallops with Ibericio ham. We ordered one dessert to share, a refreshing pannacotta with chopped fruit and Rotella. The 2 course set lunch is a reasinable $34++ while the 3 course is $38. A slice of warm crisp bread was served. Delightful and very helpful service from a friendly and gracious gentleman, perfect! Lovely ambience in the colonial style dining room, elegant and understated with a square vase of flowers, can't think of a better way to spend a rainy afternoon
5
The very lovely Jubilee Room is not only charming but brings in a calm and a sense of peace despite the restaurant being busy when we were there. Unhurried. Elegant and an atmosphere you just want to soak inService - warm friendly intelligent yet unobtrusive Food - loved every morsel of our foie gras, beef and strangely tho I resisted the suggestion of truffle fries as a side I was the one whom the others had to fight. The green pea soup looked too green to start with but one spoonful and even the Colour seemed perfect. The fondant tartlet worked for me.
4
I loved the elegance of the place, and the simplicity of the interior design which made my experience really relaxing.
The waiters and waitresses were very attentive to our needs
4
I like the ambience of the resturant and the service of the staff. Food was nice I like what we can and they were really exquisite. It was really nice.
5
Went there for dinner. Enjoyed the food, ambience and most importantly the professional Nato standard of staff. Service standards are impeccable.
5
Exceeded my expectation. The restaurant is elegant, food is excellent and service is outstanding - discreetly attentive! Nice wine selection as well. We had a superb Smith Haut Lafitte 2008, which was reasonably priced.
4
Went there for husband birthday and they prepared dessert with greetings on it. Staff is friendly and well-trained. We ate the winter edition special menu - food was full of flavor and unexpected twist. Husband is satisfied so am I.
5
A fine range of carefully prepared food and excellent, attentive service. Also there is a wide choice of very good wines, and a friendly, knowledgeable maitre d' who's made a few wine tours himself. The colonial setting is very tasteful.
5
This was by far the best restaurant that I've been to while visiting Singapore, the food was great and the service was even better.
5
Fantastic, attentive service. Chef went out of their way to accommodate our tables requirements. A wonderful evening, enjoyed by all
5
Awesome date night! Went to the movies, then hit Flutes.
Extremely friendly service. Great drink selection. Good wines by the glass. very good food. exceptional desserts!!
5
Flutes' reputation carries over from years back when the restaurant was at the Fort Canning location. After moving to the National Museum of Singapore, it has changed from being a magnet for locals to rather an event destination given the architectural icon it is housed within (think weddings).Don't drive to the restaurant, parking is nil. Take a cab and enjoy the massive wine list (the Aperitif negroni was pretty good too)But DO GO, the experience is excellent!One, the food is supreme and that is a given. Just go to eat, please.Being able to walk from the cosy and intimate restaurant through the national museum's main entry and atrium at night without a soul around is amazing...BUT Two, the professionalism and attention to detail that the staff brings to the event (a fun meal with good friends) is THE reason to go and sets Flutes apart from a lot of other supposed high-end dining locations.Ali was our maitre d' for the evening and was an absolute gentleman. It was quiet and he made a point of taking special care of our group of four, suggesting suitable alternatives for the wine when we realised the bottle we drank was the last one in the cellar and ensuring that we were not forced to suffer on price or quality.Ali helped create alternative options for our vegetarian friends when the menu did not offer them and he was on hand for a quick chat as we wound up the night.The menu is short but varied. It is arguably not groundbreaking food-flair but rather high quality food delivered cleanly and with excellence in everything. You cannot beat a burrata and ripe tomatoes; minty pea soup; risotto with a lightly crispy rice topping (unusual and a nice twist compared to normal glugginess) and juicy lamb cutlets with spiced dukkah and roasted eggplant.What seems to be a Flutes legacy is the dessert plates with written messages on them; happy birthday/happy anniversary/congratulations etc. Between the two couples we have seen a few of these and this trip was no exception. Nice touch by the staff and good skills.There could be a couple more vegetarian options available but as mentioned the kitchen is skilled enough to offer alternatives on the spot. It's obviously not a cheap-eat, this is a treat of a location but you'll not be disappointed. Make sure you visit the restrooms and enjoy the wander through the museum; they usually have a standing display in the main atrium that you can peruse if you want...an added bonus to a high quality evening
5
The menu was good quality and value for money, service was excellent.
we will come back for sure, may be for the brunch.
4
Customer service is really polite and trained . Flutes restaurant is polite to wait for us even I was 15 mins late and they are going to close the order .
5
A once in a lifetime experience! We had an wonderful evening. Outstanding Service, always with a smile. Marvelous Food in all 3 causes.
5
Very impressive Service, friendly, professional and efficient staff. High level food with very nice presentation. A must do!!!
4
Went to the Museum and saw this restaurant. Very nice place to dine. Ambience, food and service is one of the best. Nice place to bring a date or celebrate a special occasion.
5
We went for my wife's birthday. Located at museum, building and setting was superb. Service was awesome and the food and wine flawless. Would definitely recommend to anyone wanting a fine dining experience.
5
Superb venue, superb service, superb food.
2 of us chose the degustation menu and 2 went from the standard menu. All serves were great and wine was also fantastic.
Would definitely recommend for both the great venue and great food.
5
The service was better than expected, and the food was great. Definitely one of the top choices for a perfect date with your loved ones if you are looking for somewhere romantic. The private room was cozy and quiet, but the air-condition was too cold, making the food cool quickly. Overall, it was a perfect dining experience at FLUTES. Will definitely visit again!
5
Decided to have lunch her when visiting the museum. Wonderful experience, would definitely recommend. Beautiful food, excellent service, wonderful surroundings. Some might think it is expensive but you get what you pay for. They a set lunch menu which we all had and thought was very good value
5
Flutes is located in the museum and is a superb place to eat, as you walk in the door there is currently an amazing display of tin saucepans, fry pans etc, sounds odd but is awesome. The service was fabulous, so attentive and helpful and the food was exceptionally good, there were 3 of us in our party, we all chose something different from the menu and all said it was the best meal we had eaten in a very long time, I cannot recommend this highly enough, you must go if you are in Singapore, it's not the cheapest but well worth every $, we spent just over $400 for 3 courses and wine for 3 of us
4
Very good ambience with good quality food. While prices are a little high, serving is quite generous. The lamb is most delicious.
Service is most attentive and thoughtful.
5
Great ambience and good food. Liked how the staff are so attentive yet doesn't make you feel uncomfortable. Excellent settings for occasions.
4
Visited on a weekday evening and was not too crowded. Food was delicious and service was great. Love the tea set that they used, very pretty! Hope to go back again to try their lunch or afternoon tea.
4
The staff were very friendly and helpful and the restaurant is pleasant enough but for Christmas dinner was nothing special, didn't really feel festive.
5
Love this place. You are sure in for the great evening. Taken their set winter meal. Totally worth it. Service is impecable. Will definetely recommend and back
5
This is our first visit! We make our reservation just an hour before we show up at the restaurant for our wedding anniversary dinner. We requested for a table away from the crowd as I just wanted a quiet dinner with hubby. Honestly, I wasn't expecting that my request could be fulfilled. When we arrived the restaurant was full but the waiter showed us to our table (by a quiet corner which was perfect).The server (sorry, I didn't get his name) was attentive yet giving us the space that we need. Food was excellent especially the lamp. The steak unfortunately was a bit dry for my liking. We had Pan Seared Foie gras, Seared Atlantic Scallops, beef tenderlion, lamp (which was excellent) and ending it with tea and desserts eton mess and lavender creme caramel. The restaurant was very sweet that they paired both desserts together and wrote a congratulatory note on the plate for us. Overall, I had a very enjoyable dinner ... nice ambience, good food and company of my love. Definitely will go back again

The Salmon gravlax starter and the braised pork belly as a main in its Executive lunch were beautifully presented and absolutely delicious. And when the restaurant was informed that one of our guests had dietary restrictions, the Chef specially suggested a selection of vegetarian dishes as options off the menu. Again the specially whipped up dishes were faultless in presentation and Flavours. The icing on the cake though was this: knowing we were celebrating our friend's birthday, they presented Sue a complimentary meringue embellished with birthday wishes to be shared at the table even though none of us had ordered any dessert.... and waived corkage charges for the bottle of Prosecco we brought! Any wonder we go back time and again for a decade

One of the best service in Singapore i must say. Rarely to have this kind of high standard of service in Singapore. They went extra miles to actually accomodate my 5yrs old son. The food were amazingly executed. Presentation and taste wise were unquestionable. A huge appreciation to the staff who attended to us (too bad i couldn't catch his name, a Malay guy). Thank you for the 1st class service rendered. Well done!

Had a lovely evening at Flutes for Christmas dinner. The food was exceptional and beautifully presented. Coupled with impeccable service that was attentive but not intrusive, it made for a great experience. The maitre'd ensured we had all we needed and ran the restaurant well; we were wishing for a leisurely meal and this is what we got - were there over 3 hours! Well done to the Flutes team, I would highly recommend

It was a birthday celebration for my close friend and with the help of the staff we surprised her with a mini birthday song plus birthday dessert. The staff were prompt and friendly and professional.
4
Nice place for a romantic dinner with attentive staff. Food is served timely and with top marks for the seared scallops...will come back again
4
The food is above average not exceptional. Lamb is tender. We enjoy every moment of it! Value for money.
5
The service was good. Waitress even helped me changed the dish when she realized I don't like the fish very much.
5
Could not fault any part of the experience. Staff attentive, welcoming, friendly and helpful. Food well presented and tasted delicious. An amazing experience from start to finish. Would recommend a visit to anyone visiting Singapore
5
We had lunch at Flutes as we visited the National Museum and we were in for a stunning surprise. The place is gorgeous, very sleek design, service was outstanding and the food was out of this world. They were also able to cater specifically for our friend who is vegan and devised some special dishes for him. Every dish we had was absolutely amazing and so were the wines and prosecco we ordered. We will for sure be back on our next visit
5
Visited Flutes on Friday, November 18th . Clearly one of the best restaurants in all Singapore . Ambiance very charming . Service is impeccable . Food marvelous. Bar tender mixes your drinks exactly as you want them . All the things you would expect in a five star restaurant. However - they exceed your expectations. Every aspect was superb. We will be returning - you should to
5
I popped in not realising it's a bit classy but was greeted with a smile. I just wanted something small as I was due to start my course so didn't want the after lunch lull. They made a salad up for me which is meant to be a side without hesitation.The food was delicious and the service was brilliant.I really appreciated being looked after so well, the place is stunning and worth the 5 stars I have given. Thanks for going above and beyond. Best wishes Sar

We were lucky enough to be seated in the private room, as there was a wedding reception in the main hall. Please remember to reserve by phone or online first. The ambience was perfect with the large windows letting in plenty of natural light. We enjoyed a nice brunch in the mellow afternoon sun. The service was impeccable with Hadi our delightful server. I liked the truffle fries with the generous drizzle of truffle oil and good crisp. I loved the off menu chocolate mousse. The fondant was too sweet for my liking. I had a lovely Cabernet savignon, at a reasonable 10bucks a glass. My partner's sav blanc was fruity and sweet. Would recommend the Singapore sling at 11 bucks a glass for foreign friends.
4
We had soup of the day and a bread basket for lunch. It was a corn soup with crab meat. The soup was delicious, but small. There were many waiters and they were extremely helpful.The restaurant was a little too pricy, I think.Look for more reviews by MulleEllum
5
Was there for a drink while waiting for an event to start. It was a really great experience. Very professional and extremely friendly staff! Romantic and relaxing ambient. Highly recommended! Will definitely come back to try their food.
5
Love the ambience and the deco.
Food and wine menu was excellent! We enjoyed the fine taste of each course offered.. the service was superd!
5
Great first experience in flutes. Lovely and attentive staff, very professional and friendly. Tasty and refine dishes, quality is clearly their obsession. Will definitely be back.
5
Wagyu beed carpaccio with truffles and quail egg, beef melting in the mouth and the whole staff open to talk, suggest, help and listening... one of the best experiences ever
1
We were turned away as we had children with us (a 4 yr old and 2 yr old) and because 'our children may disturb the other diners'. This was particularly odd as there was only one other group in the restaurant at the time and they had a 7/8 yr old with them. We offered to sit in the outside area but this was also refused by the management. We found the manager to be unreasonable and rude
5
If you go to the museum you might as well eat at Flutes. The setting is very nice, chique looking with very helpful staff. We had a very nice meal and really enjoyed the ambience. It's a place you could go back to because the food quality was outstanding
5
Ate here as part of a meeting dinner. Although there were about 35-40 of us, the food was excellent, great service, great food and lovely choices for the dinner.The veranda area was lovely for pre-dinner drinks, and then the dining room was lovely.Be a lovely location for more intimate dinners too.Would definitely return
5
In some ways our visit to Flutes had the potential to go quite badly. I, inadvertently, chose to make our reservation on one of the nights of the Night Festival. My only complaint was that I probably should have been informed of the special events and resultant lack of parking when I made the reservation. But we took a taxi so it didn't matter anyway. Even with all the special events going on and the special (limited) menu, we still managed to have a lovely dinner. Lucky for us,we liked the set menu choices and the service was superb - really good service can make up for all sorts of things.
5
The Museum setting is an excellent backdrop for this lovely restaurant. The lunch and dinner menus are wonderful, the service impeccable, and the wine list is well balanced and very reasonably priced. There is a very nice private room for functions of 20 or so and the main dining area is comfortable and inviting. I would recommend this place for a great lunch during the week, a long leisurely brunch on Sunday or a lovely dinner with your special someone, friends or for business entertainment

It was our second time celebrating special occasions. The first was when they were located at the fort canning. This time round at national museum. Both my hubby and I agreed that both standard of service and quality of food maintained. Every dish came out stellar. Their beef tenderloin and foie gras was really good. If you ever visit, dun miss the entree foie gras, it melts in the mouth with a pan seared fragrance. In terms of value for money, the flute beats les Amis hands down. We visited the latter few mths back but it was not stunning. The ambience was set in museum and it is perfect place for romantic dinner. As I was there to celebrate my hubby's birthday, the staff was thoughtful to prepare a nicely presented dessert and candle for his birthday
4
We had a good lunch at the National Museum of Singapore. The foods were good but not exceptional. However, the service was excellent. I like the ambiance too.
5
I've been coming to this place for brunch for years ever since their fort canning days. Food is excellent, service is also very gentle. Love their bellinis. Lunch set menu at 38++ is a sweet deal and value for money.
5
A truely stylish restaurant offering fine fare. Nice service. Enjoy a leisurely lunch after visiting the museum.
5
We made a reservation for late breakfast at 10:00am on Saturday. The ambiance is one of the best in the city and we liked the food very much. The staffs were also very nice...
5
Flutes is a very classy restaurant and everything is done well from the food, to the wine and the service.
5
If you want to combine fine dining, great service and a special location, reserve at Flutes!!From the reception throughout the evening until the end - service is top. The food is simply fantastic - a creative chef prepares European style dishes on a high level. I went for the chefs menu and I can recommend it. Oysters, carpaccio from Wagyu Beef, and scallops as starters, thereafter two main dishes to choose from and carrot cake as dessert. We had a special event to celebrate and since I mentioned it during reservation, the chef prepared a very nice dessert. A really great gesture!!!!!We enjoyed the evening
4
White table cloths, high ceilings, wooden floors - very nice but a bit stiff. Tomato salad standard but beautifully done and the best dish I had. The other dishes like pea soup with truffle and seabass was normal. Good place to dine is you are near the museum 
3
We went there on a Thursday evening for a ladies dinner. We love the ambiance and service was good. The food was alright for the price that we pay. It wasn't crowded at all as there were only three groups of customers in the restaurant during our visit.We would have given this review a higher rating. Unfortunately, my friend spat out a dead fly after drinking the last sip of her red wine from the glass. The staff was equally shocked and apologized. Ewe.
5
We were disappointed to find that Flutes at the Fort was no longer as it had such a great setting. We were therefore keen to try Flutes at the National Museum of Singapore. Well the setting is more formal but the food is just as good and we were happy with everything we tried. Service was attentive and they were not overly busy on a Saturday night. If you live in Singapore maybe one for an important occasion, but otherwise if you are a visitor do try it
3
Went on Father's Day and read that it was a buffet. Turns out they consider a 6 item spread to be a buffet for a supposedly quality restaurant like this! The staff was very well trained and accommodating towards us ordering off menu for our picky eating child. But I certainly wasn't impressed by how we went seated right at the back of he restaurant, next to where all the extra serveware and staff clothing were hung...I felt like I was eating in a storeroom! Also, for a top notch restaurant serving a classic bread and butter pudding, it was both a surprise and disappointment that they do not serve it with the expected cream/custard sauce. What a shame it is because it is otherwise located in such a beautiful building. But we certainly won't be back again and we can't foresee how this place will survive for over a year if its food remains as bland and uneventful as it did.
4
Great romantic ambience that exudes class n refinement. The waiters and waitresses were very polite and attentive, to an extent that is not intrusive. Coupled with great food that is obviously cooked with care and finesse, this is a must-visit restaurant!
5
I took 18 colleagues and clients for dinner last week. The service and the food were absolutely excellent, so was the choice of wines. We also enjoyed personnel drinks on the outside terrace. A great way to finish the day.
4
Had a large group dinner with set menu and two choices of main. A great experience, very efficient staff all the meals served hit and fresh and together. The quality of the food and the prevention are excellent. Would definitely recommend.
5
Food is excellent, well presented, service is perfect.
Ideal for Romantic dinner, or for business.
Will come back for sure.
5
No more doubts about this place. Give yourself and your date a chance to savour the impeccable European cuisine and charming service, amidst the grandeur of the national museum
5
On 13th May we brought our British friends for dinner. The place, the foods and the staffs are above the marks. We will be back again and thanks to the great chef as my UK friends really loves it.
4
Top notch service, and excellent food! A**** All around. I had a lovely experience and will recommend to all my friends and family. Keep up the quality guys!
4
Fantastic restaurant and highly recommend. We went with the kids (young) for lunch as We where at the museum. But I would suggest going without them and enjoy it.
The food and service was excellent.
5
In the numerous occasions looking at the exhibitions we have noticed the restaurant and thought we would give it a go. The food was absolutely sensational; scallops light and perfectly cooked, double cooked pork with home made apple sauce (and plenty of the sauce) was melt in the month, and the coconut sphere fresh. It was all so delicious and our next visit, we would go straight to Flutes rather than the cafe. The brunch menu and afternoon tea looks inviting as well - and have no doubt will be as good dinner
4
My sister, cousin and bestie organized my hens' high tea at Flutes - and I loved it! It was so elegant, and the entire table was beautifully decorated in a blue theme. The food was wonderful (the sandwiches in particular were delish, and the pastries were to die for) and the tea was good as well. Service was stellar and the location itself (inside the national museum) was excellent. Really happy that the ladies chose this venue for my party, and loved every minute of it
4
Situated inside the National Museum of Singapore, the restaurant is perfectly placed for an exclusive business dinner or a romantic evening. The ambience and decor is warm and inviting. Food is ok but a little hit and miss...
3
Was expecting very nice EggBen for my Saturday museum walk brunch. It turns out to be just normal EggBen. Not to list in my EggBen fave. Service is good.
4
Great setting, friendly staff, great food! It has been always s place for me meeting girlfriends for lunch. The lunch set menu is a great value. Hard to get taxi from the restaurant.
5
We came across this restaurant on a visit to the National Museum (at basement level).
Amazing service from attentive staff, great presentation of dishes and delicious flavours.
In addition......stylish,comfortable environment and great value for money.
Michelin star standard in our opinion.
4
I love the the service from the Restuarant manager Ali , ambience is great and will be a great close off from a visit to the museum
4
I took my partner here for dinner during our stay in Singapore based on other trip advisor reviews and I can't fault the restaurant the menu was interesting with some exciting if different food combinations/flavours which proved very nice and the service was good. We went during the week so it was really quiet and lacked a little bit of atmosphere but the venue was nice and had a nice decor. I would recommend trying it for a special ocassion
5
Located in the Singapore Museum, this fine dining restaurant is a real treat to visit. Prices for Brunch is reasonable and service is excellent. The room is beautifully appointed with elegant art, linens and flowers. Choices for Brunch include Eggs Benedict, Fish and Chips or a burger and fries, Wine is reasonable at $10.00 a glass
5
Weird feeling going to a museum for dinner. Museum is not a place most people will think of going for a meal.it turned out surprisingly excellent in many aspects. My hosts made the perfect choice. Food is great, reasonably priced wine and impeccable service. We truly enjoyed the whole experience of having dinner in a museum
5
We visit the marvellous Museum and asked for a table for two for lunch having no idea about the place and excellence at this Restaurant. Manager Ali was very helpful and friendly from the first moment, excellent Food (Foie Gras!, Beet root Ravioli!!) and wine (Chablis) and brilliant service, These kind of places around te world are rare as we know after 25 years of travelling, compliment! We do hope to get a table next time when we stay in Singapore...Manuel & Martin from German
5
 We celebrated my daughter birtsthday and everything was perfect; the food, the staff and the environment.We chose the tasting menu ( I think there it's said Chef's menu) which we liked every dish but especially scallops.The staff was professional but very friendly, helped us with everything and had details to my daughter.To sum up, if I go back to Singapur, I will return to the Flutes
5
The 3 course set lunch was great value for money. Most valuable of all was the fantastic food. Chef cooked me a very delicately balanced vegetarian pasta with asparagus and mushrooms. The service is always warm and nice. We love this place!
3
Flutes is located in the National Museum. Most of the people at our meeting ordered the lunch set, which had several selections to choose from. Service was a bit slow, and food was OK.
4
Flutes is one best restaurant for dinner. Ambience is good. Service staff is warm and good. Menu is high standard. Welcome Chef and staff. Must try restaurant.
4
Flutes is in the basement level of Singapore musem. It provides classic western fine dining. You can go through the musem to get a feeling of Singapore culture and history before or after your meal. The steak served is the best to go as compared other dishes like fish. The appetizer is like a piece of art craft with amazing taste. The desert is definitely the beautiful closing of the dining pleasure. A glass of wine of many choices will make it perfect dining experience
5
Able to enjoy good food nowadays seem the normality when dining out in certain establishments but being pampered by the friendly and knowledgeable service brigade is definitely as main factor of a great dining venue. Having read about this dining room at the National Museum, indeed prompted me to experience their well - crafted works on the plate. What made is most satisfying is the level of attentiveness from their Server Mr. Bing who made our brunch more memorable. Our brunch begins with the Mulligatawny Soup with Braised Wagyu Oxtail, Grilled Asparagus Salad with Brown Butter Mayo and Assortment of Heirloom Tomatoes with Goat Cheese and Smoked Salmon Brioche were highly enjoyable, concocted with specific flair of lightness in taste. The soup once popularized in the colonial era by the Memsahib's menu, diligently spiced with mild curry created an instant comparison with La Grand Dame Raffles old grill room version which needed no declaration who's better as Flutes Chef brought out a better adaption of light yet hearty with the wagyu oxtail texture. The grilled asparagus salad and the excellent variation of heirloom tomatoes are worthy the tastes that one to seek for. The fragrant from the well buttered - toasted Brioche sandwich enhanced with Smoked Salmon and Cream Cheese, had the better crunch and enjoyment of each bite!The quality of service deliverance from Mr. Bing indeed very commendable effectively from his menu introduction till our dessert offering is one unique experience. He made the extra effort with his Pastry Chef, serving a tasting portion of the Lamington together with our dessert order of Coconut Parfait when our actual dessert selected only available through prior notice. This entrepreneurial service recovery certainly well deserved the credo when comes to the pampering what its counts... Kudos to Mr. Bing.Flutes at Singapore National Museum mirrored this "progressive good service version in mind, a concocted taste in heart, an approach to delight and a well recognized dining experience to cherish" .... and deserve the respect through being impressively capable
4
A great surprise this elegant restaurant located inside the National Museum .We were there for lunch and they have a 2 courses at 34 $ and a 3 for only 39$ .Our raw King fish with squid ink was perfect ,fresh and citrusy ,the main ,a perfectly cooked barramundi from Australia came with sautÃ©ed fresh peas and crunchy vegetables and the pineapple tart was wonderful .The warm bread was very much appreciated as the impeccable service ,attentive and kind .A real surprise ,and it was quite full too!
5
My boyfriend and I celebrated his birthday at Flutes. The whole experience was wonderful. From the clever seating arrangement to the excellent food to the top-notch service, everything at Flutes was aimed at creating an unforgettable experience. Ambiance of the restaurant was great as well. The atmosphere was very nice and they have very accommodating staff,especially to Juan and Fil..thank you thank you..Would totally recommend! Thank you Flutes for all you did a good service
5
We had brunch there as a couple and it was our first time being in Flutes. Customer service is at its best as the servers are always attentive and ready to help. We were served by Juan, and we are very satisfied with the service that he provided. Food are served on time. The bartender, Fil, is a very friendly guy. I enjoyed the drinks that he made which are right to perfection. I will recommend this place for people, especially couples who would love to have a romantic ambience and great food with great service
4
Very nice food in lovely surroundings. Loved the art in de restaurant. Extensive wine list with lots of wines by the glass. Food is nice, especially desserts are innovative combinations. Loved the foie gras entree. Prices are reasonable. Service should be upgraded if you ask us.
5
I took my visiting parents to Flutes on Saturday night and I was mighty impressed by the experience. The food was wonderful (the portion size just right - I hate heaped plates), the service unparalleled and the atmosphere delightful - if a little quiet. Why the semi-empty courtyard? I'm perplexed. I can't think of a better place for elegant dining in the heart of Singapore, in what must surely be the island's most stunning building - the newly opened National Gallery. I loved Flutes when it was based in the old fire station nearby and didn't think it could be bettered. I was wrong. I think I love the new incarnation even more, and I'll be returning as soon as the opportunity arises (more visitors please!)
4
food was ok, we both had the turkey and the both the bisque and chicken soup was really good. except the dessert was a huge disappointment.
3
Romantic place for dinner dates and ROM. Food was not bad... kind of expensive though. Compensated by the serene and secure environment. Wonderful corner to be in, away from the city crowd.
5
This place is amazing. It is in the National Museum but opens longer hours. The food and service was brilliant. Costly but I felt every penny was well spent. Fine dining indeed.
5
Love the ambience of this restaurant. The quality of the staff and food are those befitting of a great museum restaurant. We had dinner there. While the food may appear pricey, they are not more expensive than those much hyped restaurants. It has the perfect setting for a romantic dinner. It is so serene...
4
I loved Flutes when it was located in the old fire chief's house at Canning Fort and I've been several times since it moved to the National Museum. The setting is lovely - a nicely proportioned dining room elegantly decorated.it's a setting that tends to encourage hushed tones so when we were shown to a table next to a guest with an extremely loud and intrusive voice the staff were quick to spot our discomfort and offered, unbidden, to move us to the other side of the restaurant. The menu, particularly the appetisers, was very tempting and it was hard to choose a favourite. I went for the pea soup with mi-cuit salmon which was excellent. For my main I had the braised featherblade beef which had a very nice flavour with some nicely prepared vegetables. I chose the peanut and jelly mouse for dessert which was also very good.The service was generally very good but let down slightly by the fact that a succession of people kept coming up to our table asking if everything was alright - once is fine but this was a little too solicitous!Overall, though, it was a very pleasant evening and Flutes will remain a firm favourite
5
This was chosen for the period building setting but it delivered so much more. A genuine warm welcome soon translated into a very special evening. The food was fabulous, flavours perfectly judged. As the maitre cleared our main courses he asked how we were enjoying our stay in Singapore and we memtioned we we on our honeymoon. A few moments later out came a plate of signature desserts with a lovely message written out in chocolate - heavenly. And when we struggled to find a taxi as we left he came out and phoned for one and stayed with us until it arrived. Incredibly personal and warm service. Highly recommend it
3
Came here due to the reviews and my friends are the creative types. Though the museum setting could be inspiring They have a la carte or set menu for dinner. We chose the former as we didn't like some of the items in the latterI skipped starters as the list was boring. My friend's scallops were ok. The other had tomato salad. Which looked boring My main of tenderloin was undercooked though I ordered medium. Sent it back and it returned overcooked . Portion was also tiny. My friend's cod was equally tiny with a tiny chicken wing that was too salty. Overpriced at $48Dessert was better than the main/starter
4
A surprisingly good restaurant attached to the National Museum, this is a place worthwhile the trip by itself.The ambience is outstanding- high ceilings, a light installation easily mistaken for a piece of art (unless I mistook a piece of art for a light installation), varying paintings on the wall, big windows- one feels suddenly very rural, away from it all.In addition, a very pleasant lunch menu. Scallops and foie gras for starters were done just as can be expected, but it was some of the little extras that made my day. My scallops were served with Brussels sprouts- not usually my favorite, but here they were halved with the cut side pan seared, and a few tiny, beautiful leaves taken off and individually placed as decorative elements.I was very happy with the mains, a beef brisket cooked sous vide. It had been marinated in red wine, the consistency was just melt- in- mouth- a real pleasure.By contrast, my wife's duck breast was slightly undercooked- probably due to the rather thick cut used. While presentation and flavour were appealing, few will appreciate poultry oozing blood when being cut.The "dark berries" desert- cherry consomme and sorbet with black berries was intense in flavor, light and made for a welcome change from the usual fare.All in all a pleasant experience and a place to go back to
5
We are boring people that like coming back to the same place week after week for the people that serve, the food, the ambience and feeling very at home. Flutes has been on top of our list for the last 3 years. And so we make it a point to come by every weekend whenever we are in town. The service people are highly professional yet friendly and warm. This is the very thing that sets Flutes apart from many many fine dining places.Chef whips up new dishes every now and then. The latest duck fillette is very good with a tinge of truffle taste. The cod spaghetti aglio olio is also comfort food to me. And Jenna lovingly creates new desserts which always make me very happy.
5
This restaurant had been recommended to us by a friend. Tucked away by the entrance of the National Museum, the restaurant is exquisitely decorated. The service is impeccable and I have to say Juan our waiter, was superb. The food is devine. As someone who works in the hospitality industry, this restaurant scores top marks. Thank you for such a perfect experience
5
Nice elegant restaurant. Weekday set menus are great value. Weekend brunch offers mice choices and variety. Car parking could be tricky on a busy day.
5
A business friend suggested this restaurant for a "something different" location for a business meeting. He was correct, it IS different and in a good way. Service is quite elegant. The food is artfully prepared. The location in the National Museum is just wonderful. There is a 3 course executive lunch for a mid range price. Wine is available and the list looked very ample. We ordered club sodas since this was the middle of the day. I called ahead for some vegan options and the chef did prepare 3 really excellent dishes for me. Portions are a bit on the small side at lunch, maybe different at dinner. I recommend this place highly. -Enjoy.
5
This high end restorant is a class by itself . The location and the choice of the dishes offered are a blend of delight and exotic . Memorable experience .Be prepared to make advance booking to avoid disappointment .Prices are worth the memory of being here 
4
We dined here as a party of 9 - the service levels and food were of a very high standard and the setting in the National Museum, an old colonial building, was superb.I had the scallops followed by the tenderloin which was all cooked to perfection. colleagues had the lobster and the lamb both of which looked great.My only complaint is that the restaurant lacked some atmosphere, besides our table of 9 there was only one other table (of two people) occupied which was a shame but did mean that the waiting staff were fully focused on us.I recommend the place and would definitely retur
5
A business associate recommended we stop by for brunch, and oh what a recommendation. The design of this restaurant is superb, high ceilings and a great color scheme. The menu small, yet well varied and great valued. The French toast, is the best I have had outside of Europe or Australia! Valet parking would be a nice touch as it was a little hard to find a spot on a Sunday
5
I have been a couple of times, the quality of the food and service is 5 star. Very quiet relaxed atmosphere, excellent service. Each meal had its own special twist on what you thought you were getting. Great variety of choice but can make it hard to decide. I had a beef dish and had beef done couple of ways, also scallops with cauliflower as entree, very very nice. As for deserts, make sure you leave room as they are tasty and decadant with such pretty presentation almost too good to eat
5
We came here for brunch on a Sunday. Food was simply spectacular - especially the divine banana cake. Staff was attentive without being overbearing. I had the full english breakfast and my friend had the barramundi - we polished off everything on our plates. The restaurant was definitely a nice change from the usual brunch spots in Singapore.
5
We visited the restaurant last weekend of June with friends. The welcome was warm and correct. The maître d'hôtel was very knowledgable about the wines ( the wine list contains good quality wines , also a good choice of French and Italian wines which are reasonably priced to Singapore standards ). Both preparation and the presentation was of high quality. Although the main theme is French , the kitchen is modern French with some subtitle Asian hints. We will certainly go back and the setting in the national museum makes a good venue for business lunches
4
Nice dinner and great service, we basically had our own waiter at hand who was excellent. But I did not feel it was anything extraordinary for the price and I would not book again in a hurry. The room has no views and you only have the other guests to look at as the outside tables face into the room. And the food was ok for fine dining. But we had a very pleasant meal and night and it was sweet that they provided a complimentary dessert with Happy Anniversary on the plate.  
5
Not exactly a review of the restaurant , more an appreciation of the venue , service , friendliness , quality of food and drink we experienced at our sons wedding at Flutes on 30th May. To cater for about 60 guests for canapés , drinks on the terrace , followed by a wonderful wedding men
5
We had a lovely experience. We were well taken care of by a professional and caring staff. We enjoyed our food and the ambiance too, the music that accompanies your dinner is adequate.
5
Great dining experience. Food was good, choices, service enjoyable lunch with friends. Much prefer this location to the older one up the hill
4
Went there for dinner in a company event. Ambience is good and so is location. Nice selection of wine, good food, prompt service. Appetizers like Foie Gras were cooked to perfection and so was Green pea soup and heritage salad. Main course was Seabass in tomato sauce and was a disaster, overcooked and too salty.Nice selection of wines though, one can easily get confused
5
Every single dish, from starters to dessert, were presented and cooked just as nicely as you may wish them to be.The quality of the ingredients was also impressive, fresh, colourful and tasteful.We went there for a dinner for two, and can't wait to bring our friends.The chef and the team deserve to be known
4
We recently visited this restaurant for lunch when visiting Singapore. The restaurant is located in the National Museum and is a beautiful old building. The restaurant had been recommended to us and the food and service were outstanding. The meals that we particularly enjoyed were the scallops as an entre and the salmon and prawn main which were outstanding and very well presented. A lovely experience and highly recommended.
4
Set in a beautiful colonial building at the Singapore National Museum Flutes offers what is hard to find in Singapore,- fine dining at a reasonable price. The executive lunch of two courses $34.00 was first class. Bread and dipping oil provided. Beer and complementary wine can be purchased. White linen table cloths and napkins, delicious food and attentive service make it worth a visit even if you are not visiting the museum, - but I suggest you combine the two
4
As we had a few hours between flights we arranged to meet some friends for lunch and they suggested Flutes so we hopped off our plane and cabbed it to the Singapore Museum. The museum is a lovely building and the restaurant is an equally lovely dining room.The executive lunch at $34-39 is brilliant value. I had Foie Gras which was lovely and Sea Bass which was a lovely piece of fish and finished with some good goats cheese. The room is lovely, the service good and the value good as well.Highly recommended

The executive chef Peter was wonderful enough to come to our table towards the end of our meal and have a brief discussion about how scrumptious and beautiful our food tasted and looked. We learned that he was from Australia (our home country also). Am so proud to see an Australian working in such a privileged position in a classy reputable venue as Flutes. Tip: Have a wander through the National Museum before your meal.

This is such a beautiful restaurant, which literally has beautiful food! Everything is served artistically and creatively, yet it is very delicious. It is a great venue for weddings and special occasions! During the reservation we asked for a quieter corner as we were celebrating our anniversary, and at the end of our dinner we got a complimentary dessert -- what a nice surprise! Also, the chef noticed my instagram post and personally thanked us for choosing the restaurant! More restaurants and hotels should be interacting with their customers like that, which would earn them additional exposure and positive PR.

We will be back.
5
A calm and elegant setting for easy discussion over lunch. Three course set menu very reasonable. I had scallops followed by beef with a wonderful pistachio, pomegranite ice and lychee dessert to finish. Wonderful!
5
Recently went to the Flutes @ National museum with a bunch of girl friends for our "special" birthday celebration. As there was a wedding that afternoon, they allocated the private room to our party of 12. Excellent food, attentive service and great ambience.
5
We went last night. The setting in the old museum is lovely and the food was excellent. We were very impressed with the quality of both the service and the food.
Absolutely no hesitation in recommending them. Enjoy....

Overseas business associates were in town and Flutes certainly helped make our business meetings go even better. I wanted the well appointed private dining room but it had been booked by someone else. We were seated in the main dining room. Was a bit hesitant at first.From our pre-dinner drinks and hors-devours to dinner - everything was excellent. Service was attentive, food was very Very good. My British guests enthused it is the best restaurant they have dined in in Singapore. So glad
1
For many years we have enjoyed the food and staff at the Flutes restaurant. Until today that is. Having booked a special occasion with the restaurant we were informed the day of that our party had been relagated to the back room in favor of a larger booking that suddenly out grew their back room.So money talks and long standing customers - well they go to the back room. So if you want to avoid dissappointment you might consider booking a special event elsewhere. Unless you are preapared to take up the whole dining room in which case - never mind I am sure that they will value your cash above all else.We never expected this from Flutes. It is a pitty

Went for a birthday meal and choose the $99 set meal with my girlfriend and I choosing the different options. We had a slightly long wait for the main put apart from the food service and ambiance very really good. 2nd time I had been and would come again
5
When i first went to this restaurant I was very impressed but i decided to try again before i wrote a review just in case it was a fluke! The short answer is no, it was not a fluke this is a seriously good restaurant and a must try if you live or are visiting Singapore. Flutes is set in the National Museum of Singapore which is a truly impressive colonial building as is the restaurant with high ceilings, wooden floors and plenty of natural light which makes it great for lunch/brunch but also very impressive for dinner with the museum lit up from the outside.The service is warm and attentive, the menu is innovative and varied with a bias towards fresh ingredients and seasonal food. There is a clear leaning towards Australian produce which Chef Peter Rollinson cooks to perfection. The wine list has a great selection without it being overwhelming or over priced and should accommodate every taste. I can only suggest that if you like modern fine dining you should try Flutes
5
Thank you Flutes for a memorable and wonderful night out. I really appreciated the excellent service, especially from the hostess who went out of her way to accommodate us. The food was mostly lovely (just one dish out of many was not to our taste - personal preference) and the wine outstanding. The only down side was the bill was massively expensive, more than we have ever paid before anywhere..
4
Went there for wife's birthday dinner. It was the first time for us to be there and we were impressed by the setting, and the excellent service. The dinner room is majestic if I could say so, reflecting the true "museum" experience as where the restaurant is located. We had the Chef's table selection for our dinner. Almost all of the servings were great, but the main was a bit ordinary unfortunately.
4
Flutes is a charming restaurant, beautifully set in the National Museum. The menu is ambitious without being adventurous. During lunch hours Flutes tends to be packed with business folk. In the evenings it's a quiet affair - great if you want to talk without having to yell. Cooking is solid but don't expect fireworks on your plate.
4
Excellent food and service in the historical setting of the National Museum.
Enough choices in the lunch menu, however the portions should be a tiny bit bigger to be perfect.
5
The waiters were attentive. Good ambiance for romantic dinner. Not a lot of choice for food but the food we ordered tasted heavenly. I am not surprise when they say, "There is always space for desserts." Their dessert is a must try!
4
We went to this elegant restaurant for dinner on Valentine's Day and were not disappointed. The high quality of food was matched by the standard of service, which managed to be both professional and friendly at the same time. What a magnificent setting for a restaurant
5
We went to Flutes for lunch. Since we were there at 11:55AM, we were seated immediately.I ordered the Pan Fried Foie Gras appertizer while my friend ordered the Mushroom and Chestnut Soup. For the main course, we both ordered the Grilled Fillet of Barramundi.The Mushroom and Chestnut soup was creamy and tasty. The Grilled Fillet of Barramundi was delicious and cooked to perfection. The grilled fish skin was crispy and delightful.For dessert, I had the Eggnog Panna Cotta and my friend chose the Fruit Salad. Both desserts were refreshing.Service was very good, attentive and unobtrusive.The restaurant decor was colonial style, with mirrors and pictures hanging on the walls. Since it was Christmas week, there were Christmas decorations all around the restaurant and piped-in Christmas carols that added to the atmosphere.The lunch was good value, with the excellent food and impeccable service. I will be back next month to try out next month's menu.Flutes is inside the Singapore National Museum at Stamford Road.Tip for foodies: Check out the executive lunch menu at the restaurant website (www.flutes.com.sg)

Based in National Museum, this could easily be one of the best places on the island. Be it for a formal dinner, an invite or a family outing or a date, this place will suit all. The decor is classy and the wine list is out of the world. One is missing out on a lot without experiencing Flute
5
When I heard we were having lunch in the restaurant in the Museum I imagined decent food in OK surroundings with maybe a nice painting/sculpture or two. This beautiful restaurant is WAY better than that. The decor is fabulous, light, airy and cool, modern yet somehow traditional, with fantastic flower arrangements. tasteful table settings and yes, paintings and sculptures which fit in to the quiet ambience of the place. Efficient, beautifully trained and turned out staff attend to your every need, an excellent and good value lunch menu was explained as required to us. Drinks, including plenty iced water were brought out quickly. The food was delicious and stylishly presented; it was a perfect lunch. Just wish I had more time to wander round the museum afterwards
5
My second visit to Flutes but this is our first time since they moved to the National Museum. An even more perfect location for this restaurant with elegant, timeless decor in a historical venue. Service provided during reservations was cheery and polite. Service during meals was exceptional - quietly attentive and impeccable. The food - when one first takes a glance at their menu (we had the dinner menu), some condiments on their dishes may cause some raising of your eyebrows - chocolate/pineapple on foie gras? But the chef has taken great pains to make every dish unique, without making it odd, and instead has provided a fantastic experience for the palette. We tried the foie gras, carpaccio, wagyu rump steak, barramundi, and a whole host of desserts - and every dish was a two thumbs up.The ambience is beautiful - very suitable for quiet dinners or even business events. Not overbearing or overly cold/formal - instead it exudes the warm elegance of an inviting colonial home.The best part about the whole night - a very rare experience of value for money and a definite wish to return again
5
Flutes is an exceptional restaurant, based in the National Museum of Singapore building. It is lovely in every way - decor, food, wines, service, and atmosphere. The staff are discreet but attentive. We have been twice now, and would thoroughly recommend it. It is not very well advertised, and publicized, so it tends to be quiet. However, I urge Singaporeans and foreigners alike to use it or lose it
4
Great location for business lunches at a reasonable price, enough choices to please everyone and good quality food without exception. Also worth a visit for a weekend brunch. Gorgeous location at the old museum - parking can be a problem on Sundays but Park Mall is just a short walk away.
4
Thought the venue, atmosphere and service were brilliant. Staff attentive, polite and generous. Food ranged from very good - one starter and our shared desert, to average for the main, and disappointing for the other starter - ok but not good enough for the price - too plain. Will go again and take friends but try some other dishes......
5
Had a lovely sat brunch with my family. Nice touch at the museum even though we do miss the old Fire chief's house. Service is immaculate as always!
3
Their food is well presented you'll fall in love with it. Tastes even better. I recommend this to all.
4
the food is served in a beautiful way, the restaurant has high standards, but I must admit the fish dish I ate wasn't the best I had (or even one of the best). The waiters and very attentive and super helpful though.
4
A nice setting in a heritage building. Well spaced tables. A general feel of sophistication. The service was great and well balanced; honest, patient and attentive, although not overly attentive. The food was great, and priced as expected.
5
Ambience - perfect
Service - perfect
Food - perfect
Our party of 9 had a wonderful wonderful time at dinner. My partner immediately booked for dinner in a week to celebrate his Dad's birthday. Says a lot for the fussy eater
5
Beautiful location, very good service and staff, and amazing food. As simple as that. 100% recommendable.
5
I don't write reviews. Didn't think 1 person's totally subjective opinion should influence the opinion of others. This one is different. I represent 15 happy diners still patting ourselves on the back for choosing Flutes.It's about the grand old location. It's about the chandeliar that takes centre stage reflected in the antique mirror.. It is the right lighting, high ceilings, tall windows, simple decor that shouts 'ambience'!It is about service. Best in a long while.Attentive yet not over the top and unobtrusive.It's about the food. The oysters, the scallops and the foie gras, the beef and fish satisfied everyone. The marrying of condiments that seemed incompatible but proved the perfect match was remarkable.We LOVED it! And judging from the busy restaurant on a Monday, so did many others
5
I went to Flutes with a friend of mine for lunch, and it was the best experience so far in Singapore I have to say. As orders close at 2pm for lunch, and we ordered at 1.55pm, we were the only ones in this fine establishment, which first was a bit unusual, but then got quickly comfortable. We had the 3 course set, including starters, main dish and dessert with coffee. The service was very attentive, and didn't rush us at all, even though we still stayed for 2h. The price for the dishes offered at 100sgd for two people was reasonable, considering both quality and the venue. This clearly is a recommendation for anyone who wants to get a really nice and decent lunch, at the right location
4
Enjoyed delicious food and the very attentive staff. This was my second visit in only one week! The children enjoyed a combi of items from the children's menu as well as a few items from the normal menu. The salad with roasted pumpkin is delicious as is a vegetarian version of the eggs Benedict. The birthday girl felt quite the lady and truly enjoyed this experience. Thank you for helping us to celebrate
5
Went last eve to Flutes Restaurant. Located in a heritage building, the National Museum of Singapore it was absolutely fabulous, the setting is superb, ambience wonderful and food sublime. Despite the fact that it was extremely busy, a large quite noisy function in the main dining room, we were in the smaller private dining room and we were able to enjoy a beautiful evening catching up with very good friends. Would definitely recommend a visit, a little on the expensive side but soooo worth it, one of the best evenings out in Singapore
5
Visited Flutes last week for dinner. Staff we very friendly, food was delicious and the venue is beautiful. I ate 3 courses and all were beautifully presented. Would highly recommend.
5
Been to Flutes for birthday celebration. Everything's wonderful and will definitely revisit again. Made arrangement to decorate the dessert before serving and, of course it was nicely done. Not only that, they also gotten us a complimentary dessert on top of what we've ordered plus secret recipe shot made specially for us.
5
Great location, great service, and the food is fantastic. Nothing overly fancy or pretentious, only very contemporary, international, high standard dishes. You can see that the staff here is very self demanding. And the price... so reasonable, it makes it exceptional. I like to dine at Flutes each time I visit Singapore and I'm never disappointed
4
we used to go my husband and i quite often to flutes at the fort and really loved it. we were so disapointed when we noticed it was not there anymore.so for my husband's birthday i decided to make him a surprise diner at flutes.that was a very good choice!the place looks amazing. we had the degustation menu, everything was really good and we also took the wine pairing. the service was very professional and friendly, the only negative comment is that they forgot to serve us the wine to go with our main course, we had to ask for it, but our plate was almost empty by then!but then it was quickly forgotten when they brought a nice birthday cake for my husband. thank you very much to all the team at flutes for making it a truly enjoyable evening
4
Interesting, unique, different, are just some of the words to use to describe the dinning experience at ninja. If you don't freak out easily this should definitely be on your to do list, it's like eating a banana, you have to try it to see if you like it. But it's good clean family fun, I liked it and so did my peps
5
I don't know what is it about the gripes with some previous reviewers and the small portions but we are repeats here and Flutes deserves every accolade. Flutes on the Fort (it's old incarnation) was vineyard charm at its best, now they are doing it again in this new locale (hello, grand old lady@ the National Museum) in tasteful musee style. It's a smaller set-up here (read: intimate) with a chic ambiance, attentive servers and most, importantly, great food. I always have the foie gras (generous portions, see pic), scallops, fish and/or beef... everything's beautifully done here. Set lunch (3 courses under $50 with tax) is an absolutely bargain (it was packed my last visit); and parties in this ambience are a hands down coup. Private rooms are available for discrete gatherings (read: noisier children; guilty as charged) and all in all, Flutes is great value
5
Flutes new venue is far more sophisticated and spectacular than the last one. Set in the Singapore National Museum clearly no one knows it's here as on the night we went there were only three couples all night!As a result the service was amazing! I think it would have been anyway as the staff seemed well trained and very attentive.We had the tasting menu and it was sublime both for vegetarians and non-vegetarians.The matching wines were also good.Great place for friends, romance or business
3
Portions were miserly even for a woman. The tenderloin was tender but the portion could be finished in six to eight bites for a man. The roasted potatoes were diced so mini I had problem picking them up with my fork. It was my birthday -unlike other restaurants which give a small complimentary dessert, they put two desserts we ordered on a plate charged us for it but wrote happy birthday on the plate. For a relatively empty restaurant staff were not very attentive
5
Flutes was the venue for our marriage service and following reception.Ruth at Flutes co ordinated the whole day and as I said in the title it was absolutely perfect.Flutes is set the National Museum of Singapore, a historical national monument and a beautiful building. Inside this building is situated Flutes. The restaurant has a wonderful atmosphere and ambience, the dÃ©cor inside is extremely tasteful. Staff are very courteous, helpful and friendly. As for the food, the presentation is an art in its self but the flavours are magnificent. This beautiful restaurant is well worth a visit and not just once. I would thoroughly recommend it
4
Service was excellent, and went a long way to make up for the following: unfortunately, in the time since we had made our booking, the establishment had been booked for a corporate function. This meant that our original timings couldn't work, and it also meant that ordinary diners were few...I think there was one other couple. We were initially seated on the terrace, then moved when staff thought that the corporate customers would wish to use the terrace. When this was not the case, we were moved back. We were disappointed not to experience a 'normal' dining evening. The menu content and quality has survived the move to the larger and more impersonal premises of the National Museum. The previous place was a large and stylish colonial cottage in a green and wooded setting...and the result was a superb ambiance, which we loved. The new premises is lacking in both atmosphere and an easily accessible toilet
4
Went to the Museum,to visit the museum,but on a whim had lunch. Ate from the Executive Lunch menu though a la carte was available. Impeccable service,a great drinks menu,and tasty food beautifully presented. Highly recommended
4
Had a set lunch with colleague. The food was tasty but nothing outstanding. However I have to say the food is definitely overpriced. Then over all impression is not as good as the old version Flutes at Fort.
5
The food was excelent and the staff very friendly , very good value for money ! Grat to combine it with a visit to the national museum. International crowd, Europen cuisine.
4
This is a great restaurant for formal; romantic or business settings. Great food, service and ambiance! I was very impressed. The only setback is lack of proper parking but they do have a valet service which is ok. Otherwise, thumbs up!
5
We went to Flutes when we visited the Singapore National Museum, to have lunch, purely by chance; we loved it, the decor stunning, the service attentive without being obtrusive, the food tasty.We booked dinner there and then for night before we were due to leave Singapore, unfortunately we hadn't realised that our flight was early in the morning after we had booked for. We rang at rather late notice to change our reservation a day earlier, this was accommodated but we were warned that the table would be next to a rather large party. When we arrived we were disappointed by the table location, but were offered a table outside, as the main room of the restaurant was booked for big party. We were hesitant, but once seated at the table outside and started on our cocktails, we relaxed and started to feel the ambiance of the beautiful setting.The food when it came was excellent, and served at a pace to suit our mood. The service was fantastic and friendly. This meal really capped off our fantastic two weeks in Singapore.Superb
5
Wow what can I say about flutes......AMAZING!!!!We were away from home and feeling blue as it was Christmas Day and we were not with out family.however my husband booked flutes for us and it was one of the most magical Christmas days I could ever wish for!!! The restaurant was decorated perfectly, although without decoration the restaurant is stunning!!!! The staff were extremely friendly and courteous!!! The set menu was fantastic and delicious and the wine list to accompany was exceptional!!! I can't wait to go back again!! An absolute gem in Singapore!!
5
While only finding out Flutes has moved to a new location 24 hours prior, we are disappointed and I felt a bit judgemental as the previous location had the entire checklist, atmosphere, ambiance, location and history.Surprised to arrive at the National Museum of Singapore to a smiling face from the hostess, the gracious Sommelier/Head Mgr (I believe) and wait staff. Not the same view, but they made up for it with the Christmas decorations, warm and inviting art and atmosphere and great service. It was a 66th birthday from some friends from the US who were sailing out the next day, and the night had to be a nice one. It was without a doubt a fun filled night for six of us, with great wine choices, attentive service and a range of superb choices on the menu to anyone's liking.I guess more importantly was how attentive and friendly the staff was, knowledgeable about the old and new location (means they retain staff) and how they did everything to make the night special.If you're looking for a great view 50 stories up - there a dime a dozen in Singapore, but if you're looking for great food, a wonderful cozy atmosphere in the evening to entertain and enjoy great friends or be alone; I recommend Flutes
2
We went to the Flutes at the National Museum for a special occasion. We had the special lunch menus for 2 persons @ 38 SGD + one glass of wine each + coffee + mineral water. Overall we ended up paying about 120 SGD. The positive point is the location in the museum. The décor is quite nice. Also the service was very good, but unfortunately the food was not up to the level of the décor and the service, and it was very noisy with very large groups. The starters were OK (e.g. mushroom soup), the steak was OK, but the fish a bit overcooked, and the deserts were really not great (too sweet and not interesting). We were really disappointed in spite of the nice service. We will not come back nor recommend it to our friends
5
Flutes is lovely - what more do you want me to say! It's set in a stunning room to the side of the National museum and served the most delicious food. I particularly enjoyed the scallop ceviche - lovely flavours just go easy on the lime jelly, and foie grais served hot. Leave room for the puddings - my favourite, the valrhona chocolate fondant - perfectly cooked, rich and decadent.One thing to note - this is in the museum so the loos are quite a walk - don't let that put you off this place is worth a Michelin star. Go now before it becomes too well known.PS We ate for S$180 (£90) per head including wine and impeccable service
5
A real find! Tucked in the National Museum of Singapore, this is a little jewel of a restaurant. The building has an elegant historic charm but surprisingly accessible with car park in the front. The ambience is charmingly warm and comfortable. Service is outstanding - anticipating needs yet not intrusive.Warm bread with olive oil and vinegar set the stage for the excellent meal that followed. The shucked oysters were succulent and tasty. Mulligatawny soup was authentic and memorable so don't take it unless you like the spicy soup! The cheese soufflé was done to perfection. Lamb rack, turbot fish, Italian seabass and tenderloin were all thoroughly enjoyed. Capellini aglio olio was flavorsome. Must leave space for dessert - Lemon custard, Queen's pie and fondant were delectable
5
這是一家位於museum內的餐廳, 燈光好 氣氛佳. 其中的salad of spanner crab, scallops, Victoria;s soup, lobster, wine都相當好. 其中一張Queen Elizabeth穿超人裝的畫也挺有意思. 高度推薦來此享用晚餐及慢食氣氛
5
We came here for dinner with friends and we really enjoyed it.
The ambience is very cosy and quiet. It's perfect for good food and relaxing time !

A family group of 6 on a recent visit to Singapore were able to renew acquaintance with this restaurant, now within the National Museum of Singapore buildings. Situated in a lovely spacious, quiet, old style room, with lots of table room, this delightful restaurant provided us all with an evening to remember. The staff were friendly, cheerful and efficient, all attributes of which full complemented the superb food. The menu should suit every taste and even included whole roasted pigeon - so rarely seen on menus thee days. Absolutely delicious, as was the whole meal. The whole experience made for a very special family occasion, and one which we will long remember in anticipation of our next visit. What else would you expect in Singapore but the best
4
Been to flutes new restaurant a couple of times since it opened.Ambience not as unique as the old colonial house but still a nice feel to it within the museum premises.Food is good some dishes excellent. Steak is, always. My food was cold last visit though but staff graciously replaced it with a new one served piping hot. Service is top notch. Friendly and very professional. Good wine selection too. Pricing high. Expect to pay atleast $100 per person with wine. Definitely will return, staff make up for any weakness is some of dishes.

That popular tune by Lorde kept drumming through my head as we entered the almost hallowed interiors of the National Museum of Singapore. (Its official opening dates back to 12 October 1887 which also marked the Golden Jubilee of Queen Victoria.) Its very quiet when we arrive at 8pm (Shhh! no talking) and were promptly ushered to our seats. Its difficult not to be impressed when you have a magnificent neo-Palladian rotunda as a reception to the restaurant. Elegant whites and soft grays permeate the dining room and a discussion on the safety of the contemporary blade-like chandelier hovering over our heads suspended on seemingly weightless filaments ensued as we cautiously perused the one-page menu. We were recommended the saddle of lamb (for three); which perplexed us - why three? Must not have been an easy item to push. But since there was coincidently the three of us, we became an 'easy' target, I suppose. No regrets though as it was excellent and generous enough for four, really. Flambeed at the table, on a bed of rocket and well accompanied by a side of roasted pumpkin, there was little to fault. Our starters of souffle (cheese) and soup (mulligatawny) were both good. This posh Anglo-Indian version of "pepper water" here tasted suspiciously like beef rendang, though. We finished off the meal with a very delectable cherry clafoutis and figs. Our server seemed to enjoy his work very much and it showed in his enthusiasm, helpfulness and overall attentiveness. Didn't get a chance to witness much innovation although everything we tasted was executed with great finesse befitting any monarch
5
Expectations are high when you arrive in a great setting like this in the National Museum in a city like Singapore.They were met from a drink on the outdoor terrace to the private dining room.The food was excellent. I recommend the Snow Crab, Scallops and Lamb all 3 were 9/10.The service was as you would expect for this type of restaurant excellent but hardly noticed 
5
Made a reservation there, to catch up with a friend who was visiting from out-of-town. The place was a little difficult to find at night, being quite far from the main road, but that also makes it a discreet, quiet place for dining.We sat indoors, but the ambience of the outdoor seating looked better and more spacious, while indoors was comfortable but a little less maneuvering space.Food was nothing short of fantastic. I had foie gras for my starter and I will never forget the way it felt in my mouth. Main course was beef done medium, and it was very nicely done indeed. Tender and juicy, and the 3 tufts of truffle mash served on the side was wonderful. I had a red wine with my meat, and the waiter was knowledgeable enough to recommend some.My friend and I stayed rather late in the restaurant, simply chatting and completely losing track of time. To their credit, the waiters never did once come forward to remind us that they were closed for the day, nor did they request that we leave. It was only when I checked my watch for the time, that I realized we were actually the last guests around, and it was past their opening hours.For that, I'd definitely give them points, for not chasing us out sooner -- and they would have every right to.Wonderful dinner and wonderful service
4
Dined here in early September, The restaurant is housed in a lovely old Colonial building as part of The National Museum of Singapore. All the food was very very good and everyone enjoyed the meals especially the scallops and the risotto. The wine list was good and the service very attentive. Was a great location for lunch and would have no hesitation returning
5
We had a 20 person dinner for a friend's significant birthday and had a private room. The set menu, one a few choices was excellent with the main course steak cooked perfectly.Our host brought his own wine (with corkage charges to be expected), but the wine offering was broad.Being in the National Museum of Singapore, the setting is wonderful
5
I didn't want to like it. So sad that the restaurant we head for after a long drive from KL wouldn't be in the park. Almost said no but so glad we went. The colonial architecture, the beautiful chandelier in the middle of the room, the sense of quiet serenity and seeing the same staff welcoming us back was all very comforting. We immediately felt at peace. Service was spectacular as usual and I like their new look. I had the rocket salad with burratina, the mulligatawny soup and the turbot fish - they were all v v good. Too much really but I left nothing behind. My companion - a meat freak loved his usual foie gras and lamb and was happy with the green pea soup. Surprisingly good. The desserts? Didn't have room for any but tried the trifle - well presented and lovely.Head for Flutes next time? For sure
4
Had a romantic dinner there. Loved the location and ambience. Service was excellent!
The food somehow was only so so saved for the foie gras. The foie gras is really highly recommended.
5
A beautiful Colonial building, and a great restaurant! Try and sit outside on the terrace...weather permitting. The food and service are superb!
5
Despite their change of address, they managed to migrate the soul, experience, kindness into the incredible and unique National Museum old building.I have been to their good old house nearby and seriously, you cannot miss the friendliness and care of their team, unchanged in the new restaurant.I went there for both romantic occasions and as our son's school performance reward and the personalized attention was quite unique. Bring your good mood and the staff blooms like flowers in the sunny morning. Smiles are contagious and as we carry a few in our pockets with us, always, at Flutes... we are always enchanted. This team is genuinely lovely and I hope they will keep this quality of service and food at the National Museum. Will definitively come back. Very different from the old version, but elegant and surprising at the same time. Try the terrace for a change..
3
I was there with my work team for dinner. The restaurant was beautifully set and the food was delicious but I think the management needs to work on staff training. For example, guests should not be expected to call the waiter back to advise the doneness of their steak. Nor did the wait staff enquired on the guests' preferred choices of tea. These are basic customer service expected of a wait crew, even from more casual dining establishments. The serving staff had also apparently no idea how to differentiate rare and medium steaks, even when questioned, and ended up serving wrong plates of food... I feel that the crew is a team of good and courteous people. Would be a shame if the lack of productivity is due to inadequate training.
3
It is my first time to come here for weekend branch as a regualr customer since it moved to National Museum of Singapore. When I came in, I thought it was definitely not as good as before.It is losing its USPs now I.e. colonial feeling, top quality food ,friendl staff.It is sad to see one of my favourite restaurants disappear 
3
This restaurant used to be on the other side of Fort Manning Park, but has now shifted to the building of National Museum of Singapore.I have been here thrice. It's a good place for social engagement. Service is a bit slow, I understand that in fine dining there needs to be a gap between courses but 2.5 hours for 4 course meal seemed a bit too much (excluding order time). Secondly for larger groups, the serving is not synchronized so while some are half way through the meal, others were not even served. And even the drinks took too long to serve.I would have lived with all of the above had the food been that exceptional, which turned out to be a bit above average in taste. I wouldn't go to this place on my own. All my visits have been business dinners

Flutes restaurant used to be housed in an old black and white on a hill above the fire station. It has now been relocated to the Singapore National Museum. I organised for the private room to host a party of 20 people. The restaurant is beautifully decorated and has a very classic (and French) feel about it. The staff are smart, helpful and very warm. As well as the indoor restaurant area there is an outdoor seating area which looked very romantic. For a large group we went for a fixed menu. It could be that this is not indicative of the a la carte but to be fair I was very disappointed. The starter - beef carpaccio - was tasteless. The pea soup was very nice but the main course of slow roasted chicken was very dry and less than exciting. Compared to the other meals I had at the original Flutes this was a real let down

My wife and I have used this restaurant every month or so for the last 2 years and have never been disappointed. Our favourite place in Singapore, we have to go back to the UK, but we will never forget the times we spent here. It has everything for us, atmosphere, great food, great staff, front and back. Time is also up for Flutes at the Fort. They are moving to 'Flutes at the Museum' another venue with character and history. So from a tearful wife (Ann) and myself, we would like to thank all the staff, especially Anthony, Ruth and of course the chef for making our nights there something special, and wish you every success at the new venue. Cheers

We dined on the verandah at Flutes to celebrate my wife's birthday. In a delightful setting, I'm afraid we found the service functional rather than personal; the food however magnificent. I had the rack of lamb, served wonderfully rare, while the memsahib tucked into the tenderloin of beef, side orders of roast potatoes and crunchy steamed vegetables. We were both pleasantly surprised by the generosity of portion foe such a place - where I'm from such would be termed as "a good old bin-lid-full of food."As we sat afterwards mulling over the residue of an excellent bottle of Tyrells Rufus Stone shiraz (to be highly commended) and watching the army of bats flying throughout the trees and onto to verandah to mercifully keep down Singapore's mosquito population, my wife philosophically remarked "What would the World be like if there were no bats?" To which I replied, "Well everyone would be out first ball.

I never thought I would be eulogising truffled barley risotto with green peas, but this dish was probably one of the nicest things I ate in a three week business trip to Singapore. A little early for a friend's birthday dinner, I walked to Flutes and almost didn't make it. The sign posts are at best confusing. I had almost abandoned myself to a night in Fort Canning park, beset by mosquitoes, when a kind passer by pointed me in the right direction, so if you're going for the first time - take a cab! The food is fusion-ish - at the duller end of the spectrum it's that old favourite beets, goat cheese and pea shoot salad. At the more exotic, my old friend the barley risotto. The venue is fantastic - looking out into the woods is really quite magical. A very nice place to eat and with an interesting menu to boo

We visited this restaurant after making a lunch date with friends during a visit to Singapore. We had a table on the verander, lovely view and we had the set lunch. Very good food and great value. Highly recommend a visit to this character restaurant

After searching high and low for a top romantic restaurant I came across Flutes which also had great reviews on trip advisor. After a last minute panic to get a reservation we managed to confirm and we were off at the races.We opted for the Chefs Table, a six course extravaganza with accompany wine. We was not disappointed, food was fantastic and at a great standard and the wine pairing was spot on. Price was also very reasonable for what we received and service was ok.Some feedback, we unfortunately had to walk through a wedding to get out and this was rather embarrassing due to limited exits. Also I would like the 'wine experience' with someone explaining the wines to me and reasons for there inclusions to the chefs menu.Overall I will be back to Flutes to try their al a carte menu as some of the dishes looked stunning
4
We used to come to Flutes regularly when we first moved to Singapore over 7 years ago but I had not been here for over two years so was interested to see if anything had changed. The place itself is in a lovely position perched up the hill, and eating in an old 'black and white' feels very civilised. We were here on a business lunch and so went for the set lunch menu which is good value at SGD38 for three courses. I had the foie gras starter which was perfectly cooked (SGD8 extra), then followed with what was shown on the menu as 'duck cassoulet'. This turned out to be nothing of the sort, instead we got a rather fatty confit of duck with a small dry piece of pork belly and two slices of some kind of sausage. Disappointing as I was looking forward to a proper authentic French casserole of duck cooked with white beans together with the pork and sausage. My colleague had 'seared' sea bass, which put our client off ordering it as she assumed it would be cooked like seared tuna, ie brown on the outside but raw inside. Perhaps someone else should write the menu......

It's hard to find a restaurant in Singapore that is in such a nice quiet outdoor setting away from traffic noise. We had a business lunch on the verandah and the setting could not have been better - an old colonial house, verandah surrounded by frangipanni trees in flower, great service and great food. Not cheap but also not as over-priced as other less appealing places in Singapore. I'll be back
5
My other half and I went to this restaurant before we went to Shakespeare in the Park; that was our undoing. It's housed in what used to the Fire Chief's residence and it really is a lovely old building. We booked a table for 6pm, but went a little early to sample one of the many champagne cocktails they offer in the bar downstairs. By the time we made it to our table on the verandah it was 6.30 and we only had a hour until the play started. We could have stayed for hours. The waiter; Anthony, was attentive and helpful. The food was delicious, amazing, can't say enough good things about it. The asparagus is really worth ordering. Would have loved to have stayed and taken our time with dessert and coffee, next time! Watch out for the mosquitoes, they are everywhere. Book a table on the verandah, there's not much of a view but we were entertained by the firemen playing football the whole time we were eating

Flute is set in an old black and white which takes you back in time. Lovely serene atmosphere. Hard to beat.Service, mainly from kate was attentive, efficient and friendly.Food was excellent. It's been a long time since I've been so impressed with all restaurant food. Not that we tried many dishes. We started with asparagus. All had the tenderloin and finished with different desserts. All dishes were excellent. Tenderloin was cooked to perfection with the addition of mash potato, picked onion, fried onions and broad beans. The combination was exquisite!Recommend to anyone looking for a good meal. Visitors to Singapore should really make an effort as its s unique dining experience.Well done Flutes!Note i put value is average as its not cheap. It's what you'd expect from a good restaurant. It is worth the money. We spent s$350 for I starter, 3 mains and 3 desserts plus $40 corkage.

We were a group of about 15-16 people and we chose to celebrate a friend's birthday at Flutes. Food was good...the eggs benedict had the runny yolk (at least!!) unlike many other places in the city. The steak and the waffles were quite good as well. The flip-side was the "mosquito attack"! Had quite a tough time warding off these "unwanted visitors" who kept feasting on us while we relished the food! While the ambiance was very relaxing, the mosquitoes kind of ruined it for some of us. One of my friend's asked for an iced coffee (not surprising...it's Singapore!!!)...the steward said that there was none on the menu!. Not THAT was surprising...however, when we requested, he agreed to make it for my friend which was a sweet gesture. Overall, great place, nice setting, good food...I would not mind going there again
5
Had a lovely lunch at Flutes this week to celebrate a friends birthday. The restaurant is an easy walk up from the road through gardens to the old B& W house. The friendly staff greeted us and were attentive and helpful throughout the day. We had the Executive set Lunch and everyone agreed that the food was excellent.Could not fault the restaurant or staff - a great da
4
Had dinner with my boss and his business partners. It is my 4th time for me to dine in this restaurant. It looks that they changed the menu this time and food really good eaepcsailly the starter "white asparagus " which is really tasty and refreshing. Love it
4
My girlfriend but the resturant for my birthday and made a really good choice. We had a table on the verander and although it was alittle hot the view was great and the waiter kept topping up the ice water. We had Australian lamb and beef tenderloin for the main which were cook just right and very tender follow by white chocolate desert which had a happy birthday message.Overall very good service and food quite location in a colonial building which is very beautiful would recommend and returnBill came to $162 for 2 for main & deser
5
One of my favourites in SIngapore. Excellent menu, quality location and ambience. Menu selection was varied and covers all tastes. You feel as though you are not in Singapore in this place. Reservations a must though.
5
A beautiful Colonial building, and a great restaurant! Try and sit outside on the terrace...weather permitting. The food and service are superb!
4
I came here on the 22nd Feb 13 to celebrate my bf's birthday. When I called to make a reservation, the person on the phone said there's only a corner seat on the veranda left,was worried that it might be too hot but took it anyway. I asked her if there's any special arrangement for a birthday dinner. She informed that I can leave a birthday message and they'll write on the dessert plate that we'll be ordering. As we arrived, the seat at the corner turns out to be special and perfect for my bf, just beside a window and we got the privacy and serenity to ourselves. The waiters are attentive even though we are seated totally out at a corner, we got our food served course after course and ice water topped up regularly. The food is absolutely divine for the price we pay. Would definitely recommend it to everyone
5
I invited my sister to a birthday supper on 26th February, for which I booked a table on the veranda. The setting is fantastic - colonial black and white bungalow surrounded by tropical green and relative piece and quiet whilst still in the middle of town. A fairly rare find in Singapore nowadays given what is left of the colonial heritage.The food was very good indeed, having chosen the vegetarian and the "normal" Chef's Table. The service was impeccable: attentative, genuine, and very friendly. Also, the different causes were brought in sufficiently long intervalls so that we did not to feel rushed.I can only recommend the restaurant even though it is a bit on the expensive side, in particular if one orders wine with the meal. However, it is definitely well worth a visit, in particular for a special occassion
4
There was a bit of confusion on our booking as we wanted a table on the veranda but we ended up inside right in a dead end corner of the restaurant, which meant we were serviced quite slowly and items were often left on the table for a while after being finished. Food was good, well some of the dishes were excellent others OK sizes quite smaal, disappointing/annoying was the fact we chose our food only to be told when trying to order they were out, which is always frustrating. We had a nice evening wish we had been in a slightly different location which would have meant a nicer view and environment; the location is lovely. Wish there was a bit of a dress code for such a nice restaurant ( i know it sounds old fashioned but it nice to get dressed up now and again) one couple next to us both had cut off jean shorts and fit flops on while we weren't in complete finery but we had mad a bit of an effort
5
We went over to celebrate my wife's birthday and was impressed with the great value 3 course set lunch at $38++| pax.Must try the Foie Gras (+$8) & Waygu beef (+$12). We rounded up the meal with healthy yoghurt sorbet and fresh fruit salad, followed by a pot of tea to unwind and immerse ourselves in the old world charm of Singapore.We were recommended by friends that the ambience at night is great; surprisingly we enjoyed the sun and lush greenery very much.There is complimentary valet parking for diners. Flutes at the Fort really made us feel like VIPs

Arrived very jetlagged for one night stopover for wedding anniversary. Qantas hostie suggested here.Cab got lost,our table was inside and noisy so we decided to cut our losses and go back to hotel.Waitress suggested we wait in the bar for our cab and they would send us a glass of champagne!! She returned with news of a table about to vacate and she would see what could be done.She took my husband to view the table and she returned for me and our champagnes.Wow! Within a few more minutes we again moved to a better table outside on the verandah. Heaven! Fab food, friendly staff, pretty setting.Manager apologised for delay for our dessert (we hadn't noticed) and brought us a champagne liqueur to have while we waited.Dessert arrived with "Happy 28 years strong." piped in chocolate around the plate! Amazing service-blew us away.Above and beyond any expectations.Fabulous night

Thanks to TripAdvisor! otherwise I wouldn't have found out about this gem. Its nicely tucked away just behind the Hill Street Fire Station. Access to this restaurant can be found at their website http://www.flutes.com.sg/There is a small parking area for drivers and they offer complimentary valet parking as well. I was there on a Friday evening and it wasn't overly crowded (not many do know about this restaurant I suppose) so I don't think over parking is a problem.It used to be the fire chiefs' accommodation back in those days and is now converted to a nice cozy restaurant (indoors and outdoor sitting) on top of a small hill with greenery to hide away the tall buildings of concrete Singapore. I won't recommend this restaurant for those with mobility issues as there are couple of steps to climb and no wheelchair access (that I can see).Food is just slightly above average pricing; with a glass of wine at SGD$16+ and mains averaging at about SGD$50. Food is nicely done and presented and staff attention is plentiful.I liked the overall atmosphere; with the peace occasionally punctuated with the announcements for the firemen to scramble to a activation and the blaring of the fire engines that could be heard in the background.Definitely an enjoyable romantic evening tucked away in central Singapore
5
I thought the Flute was so quaint and lovely. It used to be the residence of the old fire chief during the day and of course now a beautiful colonial black and white bungalow at Fort Canning Hill and you forget that you are in the city. You walk up the steps amongst the Frangipani trees. Nice touch to have those lovely yellow lights on the trees. We had a romantic dinner at the veranda. The waiters were attentive, and the food was great. Nice small portions. The menu is limited but it works with the type of restaurant it boasts of. All in all, a lovely place to have a meal and definitly recommend it to anyone who wants to wine and dine
5
We dined at Flutes in the evening of Christmas Day and we had a fantastic time. The ambience on the terrace is stunning, and the feelings of bygone colonial grandeur are all-around.The service is impeccable, and the food is superb. The menu is creative and uses some fantastic produce, and each dish is presented like a miniature work of art.Flutes is a must visit when in Singapore
4
Great location , awesome food. Top tip, they do some really great deals for lunch time at the weekend. Gorgeous at night for a romantic setting
2
Very nice location in a black and white house, nice protected terrasse.
Food was good.
Service was the worst I have experienced in Singapore. We arrived at 8.30pm with reservation, we finished the diner (starters, main dishes and desserts) at 9pm!!!!!!!!!!
5
I love Fort Canning park and I like going there regularly. Flutes is accessible from both the street and the park and is like a little oasis in the city center.The food is modern fusion and ideal for a long business lunch or a private dinner. The staff is very attentive and friendly
1
Tomorrow is my 60th birthday and my husband booked Flutes (six weeks ago) for a celebration dinner. On phoning today to confirm, he was advised a wedding was taking place and we could not be accommodated within the restaurant. We received no SMS or telephone calls to advise us of this change. My birthday is completely spoiled! The restaurant's representative did admit the wedding was booked after my husband's reservation. A matter of 'greed' over respect, methinks. A warning for anyone who thinks they have made a reservation and hope to celebrate at Flutes.Pepper, Singapor

Beautiful black and white in a lovely green setting close to Fort Canning. We don't have a car but there is parking available. It is in a lovely lush location away from the hustle and bustle of crazy Singapore. We had beautiful poached salmon for lunch that was absolutely delicious. Can highly recommend lunch at Flutes
5
We have dined at The Flutes before and had had an excellent experience, so we arrived for another visit, with high expectations.We were greated and offered the option of taking a drink in the bar or having a drink at our table on the balcony, which is the option we took. Drinks were served and we were left to browse the menu. Our order was placed and I was surprise how quickly our starters arrived. For me, the service was a bit on the quick side, with our main courses arriving very soon after we had finished our starters - I prefer to have a good break between the two.However, this is the only critism I could make. The food is fabulous - especially the truffle mash and the chocolate fondant (that's a must for any chocoholic!). The service is friendly and efficient. Of all the restaurants we have eaten at in Singapore, this one is the only oneto which we would DEFINITELY return
5
A hidden gem in a busy city. A chance to walk behind the scenes in Singapore and chill with great service, great food and a superb location. Perfect for a romantic evening or a special occassion.There is a choice of a la carte or tasting menus. Both we have explored at length ... and can recommend. We can't remember making a poor choice.There is seating inside and out. If out, then do consider spraying in case of the odd mosquito
4
The service staff was great, attentive, friendly. The food was average. Bit expensive. So it is not a weekly affair kind of affordable. The drinks from the bar was a killer! Awesome. The table we had, outside on the terrace, was sublime. Surrounded by trees and the air of the small hill
4
Ben, Ruth and all the staff, service and food were excellent and well worth the trip from England to be entertained. The restaurant is a converted bungalow in Fort Channings Park in a tranquil part of the city; it overlooks the central fire station. We had the Chef's Menu which included a glass of wine with each course. We had a table on the veranda. The staff made this particular birthday a particularly memorable one!
5
Stopped by for a refresher. Enjoyed the whole experience. Thank you Ben for showing us that old fashioned service is alive and well at Flutes at the Fort. We must all ensure that the old "Black and White" house is retained in Fort Canning Park as part of the history of Singapore
5
Nice house style "black and white" ask to have a place on the balcony inside is very cold near a pull over ;)
Good food nice presentation, lot of choice of wine
4
Not that convenient to get to but, once you are there, it's peacefull and charming.
If you can bear with the non air con environement...
The food is quite nice western style...
5
We've been here three times and each time we've been impressed with the level of service, quality of food and ambience. A bit pricey but worth it.

I went there for a Sunday lunch with some friends, and I had a 2-course brunch set at about $38++. The beef that I'd ordered was extremely tender and tasty, and I liked it a lot. Our table had an overwhelming amount of waffles for dessert, but one of us ordered an ice cream, and another had an Earl Grey creme brulee with black sesame ice cream. We sat inside (air-conditioned area), though it was slightly dark, and I suppose you'll have to make reservations earlier to sit outside on the big patio, which I would've preferred. What I liked best about it was that they served the entire table course by course - what this means was that everyone would be able to end the meal at the same time. Also, the next dish never turned up earlier, or late, and they didn't rush us through the meal. All in all, I liked Flutes, and will definitely go back again
4
The restaurant is tucked on Lewin terrace (entrance just between the free mason house and the philately museum) in a beautiful old colonial house lost between trees. At night the baclony is localy and romantic with lights falling from the branches and soft candle lights. Our waitress was very discreet and helpful. A big plus for her and the chef to accomodate my special allergy (gluten) with no difficulty.The menu was attractive and the food was truly beautiful. Quality meat, fresh veggies, lovely mix of flavours. The prices were reasonnable, particularly in Singapore where some Western restaurants really over charge.The restaurant seems to fit the needs of all since there were families celebrating birthdays, work colleagues, couples...Definitely a good place
5
Flutes is one of these places you walk into and then walk out of 4 hours later and completely forget you're in a big city. It is situated in a beautiful garden and when you sit outside you can see these beautiful trees and no high rise buildings or any of the hustle and bustle of Singapore. The food is absolutely fantastic, lovely to taste food cooked by a chef who knows what taste is and know's what goes together. The wine list is amazing, I know it takes a long time to get a good wine menu together and they have some sensational wines on here, all for very good value. The Service is the best I've had in Singapore for a long long time!! I didn't have to pour my own wine (shock horror!) all night and never wanted for anything.It's perfect for a romantic dinner or an intimate get together, I would highly recommend. And I will be back for sure
4
In the middle of the hustle and bustle of modern Singapore is this beautiful old fire chiefs house where exists a beautifully tasteful Australian inspired restautant a bar.You could be in another time as you eat fantastic dishes, wonderful wine with awesome service. (A rarity in modern Singapore).Been there twice now 12 months apart and it just keeps getting better
4
Flutes is a colonial style building set in a haven in the middle of the city surrounded by trees. Most of the diners sat on the very pleasant verandah, which I would recommend unless the weather is against you. The menu had a good range of dishes. The gratin of artichoke cannelloni was excellent as was the main course of bluefin tuna. The wine list also had a very good selection. Apart from the excellent quality of the food, I was struck by the size of the portions. Looking at the website you might expect modest portions - don't you believe it! Both the the starter and main course were presented in good platefuls so there's no danger of going hungry.The service was attentive - perhaps overly so, as they suffered from that annoying obsession with refilling your wine and water glasses every two minutes!Overall a very pleasant evening and I shall certainly return on future visits to the city
4
The restaurant is centrally located, but still a little hidden in one of the city parks. Although the selection is not that massive, there is something for everyone. Food is very good with the atmosphere of the old colonial building giving it a special kick.Nice location for some drinks followd by dinner. Reservation recommended

Reading previous comments the Restaurant seems to go through a rollercoaster of happenings! Where is the leadership from earlier days?! Yesterday, Saturday night, an otherwise nice evening with a friend ended with two out of three guests quite unwell. A once wonderful restaurant in terms of service, food and location has sort of lost it, well at least the quality of food. We have been visiting guests off an on over the past couple of years with earlier good experiences, except one a few months ago and then yesterday. That time, the restaurant had larger group of guests who occupied the service staff and it seemed the kitchen. The service was appalling, the food even worse. We returned the main course of Gnocci that time which looked like mashed potatotoes, after waiting for ages. Staff was apologetic (too much to do). Well if you can't handle a party and "normal guests" close the restaurant for private venue reasons! So after avoidig the restaurant for a while, we gave it another try yesterday. To be fair, the staff was most courteous and even arranged an outside table as we mistakingly booked inside. Service was very good (there were not many guests around, so at the end of the day i dont understand what this fuzz was all about needing to see if we can have a table outside after all and rubbing it in again that we made the mistake when booking?), but the food was appalling. Nicely presented for the eye though, the Consomme we had as entre was tasteless, the chestnut soup was ok. As a main we had the Tuna fish (tough) and the Sea Bram (tough and overlyoily) and the Lobster Gratin. The latter was a mistake! Something was seriously wrong with it as my husband was extremely unwell by the time we reached home! For the price we paid for three (SGD 450 with a bottle of average priced wine) this is very disappointing. We live in Singapore and have much alternative comparison - this one hits 2 out of 10 (2 for the atmosphere)
5
A great location adn surroundings for thsi restaurant. But the most remembered aspects is the wonderful food - great choice and wonderful taste.
Strongly recommended
4
always delicious food but best to sit outside on the verandah - lovely atmosphere
5
staff, location and food. all good and yes I'm a frequent visitor. If you odnt like the prices go to burger king. Enough said.

What a beautiful location, heritage house with cool internal rooms and lovely large shaded terraces in trees centrally located on beautiful park reached by steps. I went here for a special occasion following strong recommendation by friend and the great reviews on trip advisor. The experience was very disappointing - purely down to the worst service I have ever experienced in a restaurant of this stature. It verged from basically rude to non existent. I'd like to state that the food quality and execution is exceptional - I sincerely feel for the back of house magicians who are relying on a bunch of lacklustre amateurs to deliver their exceptional food. To summarise service experience - we were greeted cordially at bar level reception to the restaurant and directed to a table inside - when the service team took over the link everything went downhill rapidly. We waited 30 mins to place an order , get a glass of water. On selecting wines , the particular red wine variety we preferred we were advised they didn't stock any of the 10 or so on the list and to select a white only to negotiate the red variety we requested after much discussion. During meal we had to serve our own wine and water throughout whilst waiting staff spectated nonchalantly in the corner. After ordering desert we were presented with a bill 40 mins later and advised no more service. We had endeavoured for 30 mins to attract attention to order coffees and after dinner drink . there were other diners still receiving service outside. We were advised the bar was still open and that we could have coffees / drinks there so off we went to discover bar was being closed. This was a special evening for me which had spiralled into a disaster due to BAD inconsiderate rude service , shame on you Flutes at the Fort - we took matter up with senior member of waiting staff who advised he understood our complaint however they had a busy day. No apology or service minded response was given - what a let down to a great kitchen brigade. I won't be back am still seething due to our treatment - chefs take action your front of house team tonight were at best amateur at worst Downright rude and incapable
5
Beautiful old Chief of Fire Department's home behind the stunning 1900 fire station. Atmosphere is so relaxed and peaceful, and the restaurant is a calming white painted wood throughout. Staff are very good, and the food is excellent. We had the tasting meny with wine paring. The wine portions were generous and the meat and salmon was excellent. Really enjoyable meal. Definitely one for the couples
4
Very good foodVery good serviceVery good place (charming old house)Of course somewhat expensive but don't forget that you are in Singapore !! The city where people would accept to pay whatever price to be rudely served nicely displayed crap.Corkage fee : 30 S$Overall very good option : i will certainly go back thereIdeal for a face to face dinne
3
Had a business meeting here and was accompanied by my wife, it is a great place to have a business meeting and also pleasure - tucked away @ the back of the fire-station (it was the original fire-chiefs house I believe...)Food was very good, between us, we covered the Scallops, Foie Gras, Steak and Pork Belly, Australian wines by the glass were varied in terms of selection which suited us and the food well....Great view and ambiance on the Terrace as well...
3
We went their last night and had the Chef's table, degustation. We sat outside and the service was great, but it was a hot still night so we relocated to the A/C. From here on the night went down hill. there was a 45 minute wait between courses and the waitress knew nothing of the food she was serving
5
...in colonial style bungalow. Although the setting and the lovely outside verandah tables are both important feature of Flutes, go there expecting the highest quality food. Don't be put off by the obscure entrance and the abruptness of the valet who parks your car. Look beyond! Well worth the climb up the steps
4
Romantic & Yummy. I was very impressed when I walked up the steps - definitely set the tone. I liked how the wine glasses had a flower design on them that matched the flowers on the table. I'm glad I didnt have to pay for it.Sit outside by the edge
4
Creative menu and excellent taste. The service is attentive, the location relaxing.
5
Lovely location and great food and wine. Service always exceptional. Ask for a table on the veranda.
4
Havent been for a while but this place has NEVER let us down. And such a great building, very classy
4
The food was good, the drinks were great, the place is very nice with an outside balcony and trees, it feels away from the city but the location is very central and convenient.
4
We were a group of nearly 20 people and dinner was set. I thought the food was very good without being extraordinary. The setting is very nice and the service was very good.
5
The food was superb - I had fois gras followed by seared yellow fin tuna. There is outdoor seating on decking in the tree canopy which is lovely and it's a good location either for business or romance.
4
Was there on a Sunday for Brunch. As above, the ambience once you get in is really something different (and nice). Food was good! Wines were super yummy and pretty fairly priced. Having said that, a meal here would not be considered cheap, so expect to budget SGD50 per person for a meal. Certainly well worth the effort. However, if you are not so mobile, getting to the restaurant may prove to be a challenge given the steps to access the place
5
This is a fabulous choice for a special meal in Singapore, on the slopes of Fort Canning Park in a very pretty old colonial bungalow.The food was of an extremely high standard - both our main courses of tuna and beef were beautifully cooked. Portions were very generous and the service excellent. The wine list was more interesting and better value than in some other places we visited.You need to book ahead. We booked the day before and could only get an inside table. Although this was very pleasant, the outside tables are more picturesque
5
We could only get an early evening dinner so arrived at the restaurant at 18:30, no other guests were there. We had cocktails (very well made and served) on the terrace and enjoyed the green oasis in the middle of the CBD. We asked to see the menu when enjoying the cocktails, ordered and asked to be notified when the table/food was ready. We choose a 6 course menu with accompanying wine at SGD 186 a person. I asked to change a starter which was no problem. The food was good, well presented, wine was fine and plentiful. Service and location were great and price is quite good. So far the best restaurant we have eaten in Singapore. Only weird thing was that both my wife and I individually got stuck in the toilet as it almost impossible to open the doors from the inside. Reported this to a member of staff who responded that many customers have complained. Huh? If so, why not do something about it and install a $2 bracket
4
We went there for a Valentine's dinner. The ambience, service and location are exactly what we were looking for. The food was great. We sat outside on a perfect Singapore evening and even though this is in the middle of the city the park setting makes the city seem miles away
4
You are back in early 19s century, in a splendid back and white colonial house. A champagne glass on terrace, surrounded by trees. Dinner are really sophisitcated.
Everything is good except... the price. You pay somehting quite unique, a bit expensive then
4
Good food worth the walk up the stairs Can be a little noisy
4
Location, style of the building - they have recently started a brunch on the weekend and it is really nice. The black and white house is beautiful as well
4
A little difficult to find but worth it.
Walk up the hill, have a drink downstairs and then wander upstairs for dinner.
If you can, sit outside on the veranda and enjoy the atmosphere.
Food is largely Western, good quality and service is great.

Wanted to try Flutes at the Fort last time we visited Singapore but didn't get a chance, Glad we did this time, Very nice indeed......We were seated in a back little room but that didn't bother us, When making a reservation ask to be seated on the balcony, looked more romantic.Ordered Scallops for entree to share, very nice, Mains we ordered Lamb rack & Snapper & a spinach pinenut side dish, the lamb was to die for, so juicy.Good size meals we thought, didn't walk out hungry

This upscale restaurant on the hill has a charming colonial character, comfortable and eye pleasing setting. Its cuisine is excellent; its service that evening, however, did not live up to its reputed high standard.THE LONG VERSION:- There were four of us dining there one cool and pleasant evening in latter part of Feb. We ordered the popular fixed dinners; two of us chose wine pairing. Overall, our dinners and wines were excellent. However, our servers that evening, though very efficient, were quite mechanical without much customer interaction. For wine pairing, there was NO INTRODUCTION of the wine paired with each course!  - In my opinion, this was BELOW the STANDARD of any UPSCALE restaurant.  That evening, despite the delicious food and drinks, we did NOT get the typical, "a little pampered" dining experience expected in such an reputed high-end restaurant.Our Fixed Dinner ($108; $168 with wine pairing) is slightly more expensive than Daniel's Bistro at Marina Sands and Bacchas Boathouse by the marina, both of which have SUPERIOR service and great fixed dinners.Other WEAK Points: - The host/hostess did make us feel welcome at the start, BUT at our departure, a manager-type gentleman standing by the host station did not even bother to say good night! - Flute at the Fort is located in the beautiful Fort Canning Park, near the top of the hill (Wonderful!) BUT, on the other hand, it is also unfortunate to the handicapped, as this lovely restaurant is ACCESSIBLE ONLY via several flights of narrow stairs - wheelchair is definitely out of the question (NOT so good).By the way Fort Cannings Park and the famous National Museum in the area are favorites to the locals and tourists alike - quite worth a visit!  Peterskis, Mar 2012

For this Valentine we décides to go to flutes at the fort. After crossing a car Park and climbing many steps we arrived there and the table was almost ready on Time. We notes that the best tables are on the verandah facing a garden that you cannot see at night but since no one told us we had a table inside. For Valemtine the special menu was very big and well prepared not so Australian looking but very international.the only problem was the time we had to wait during the dishes more than half an hour and since we had 6 dishes you can compute Ho much time we spent waiting and waiting. The management realized nice they've us a bottle of wine when we left after paying a 550 sing dol bill for 2 but remember it was Valentine day. Conclusion do not go there on a valentine day or your gilfriendwill run away

Set on the edge of Fort Canning Park, this is a great little restaurant. We had the 4 course set menu with wine chosen for each dish @ $170 which was really good value as wine in these places can be really expensive. Food was excellent and the service very efficient and attentive. Go for a table outside on the varandah for the best atmosphere. The only negative we can find is that it would be truly world class if it had a decent view ! It probably did long ago; of St Andrew's and the sea but now blocked like so much of Singapore by high rise offices. Don't let this put you off though as you sit under the large branches of big old trees

My partner and I had lunch on a sunny day and the ambience was great.It felt like one was on holiday somewhere,not in downtown Singapore.The service was friendly and attentive also.However the food was very average.We had the set lunch-starters were foie gras and scallops,for main course we both had the sea bass,for dessert we had frozen yogurt and fruit salad.All the dishes were pleasant but uninspiring-none of them made you go "Wow"!The wine was pleasant but expensive-S$18 for a glass of Margaret River Riesling.The coffee and tea to finish up were good and the whole experience was okay but not thrilling.Somehow the food did not quite match the setting

I brought my wife to Flutes at the Fort at Fort Canning Park for our 9th year anniversary of being together as a couple. It had rained the entire day so sitting on the verandah was lovely, cosy and cool. The food was fantastic. I had the Chef's Table menu and particularly loved the foie gras and the dessert which was Earl Grey Creme Brulee. I must say that this is a very nice place to bring your partner and family for a nice little celebration. You are surrounded by the fauna of the park and it seems with the old-school english architecture back when Singapore was a British Colony, this restaurant fits right in with its surroundings. The service is also excellent but when the crowd grew as the night progressed along, i think they were a little understaffed. But that's just nitpicking to be honest. If you are visiting Singapore, this is a nice place to bring your wife/partner for splendid evening. Enjoy

This is in a great setting at the edge of Fort Canning Park and offers some great set lunch menus at reasonable prices. Always a sure bet for fine dining as well and close to the quays.

Celebrated our anniversary at this beautiful restaurant located right in the city center.
Decor & ambience is really good! But the best surprise is the creativity of its Chef, to create an unforgettable dining experience for his patrons.
Must-try: Scallops; Entrée & Desserts.

An amazing restaurant and a wonderful place to enjoy a tropical Singapore evening. The food was outstanding; as was the service.

Food is ok. Paying more for the atmosphere env more than anything.
Great if you want to explore the area in the morning or having a romantic dinner!

we had the Xmas Dinner set menu at Flutes and really enjoyed it. the setting is lovely in the old colonial style bungalow on the edge of the park, and the atmosphere and service was impeccable. It's not cheap and wine in particular is expensive but the atmosphere was great

We went to Flutes to celebrate a birthday and had a lovely meal. The service is good and the food is well portioned. They made a special effort with dessert and decorated it with birthday wishes which was nice. I would go back to Flutes but only if we were seated outside on the balcony, thats where the real charm is. We were in the far corner of the restaurant, indoors....and I guess thats nice if you want to be secluded with your partner but i was with my parents! Defo worth a visit but do try and get a table on the balcony

Singapore is a city that constantly finds new ways to impress visitors. Therefore it is always pleasing to find somewhere that succeeds in creating a wonderful impression on a first visit, then continues to impress on successive visits.Situated in an old wooden bungalow amidst the lush greenery of Canning Fort, Flutes at the Fort offers a unique and tranquil oasis only metres from bustling Coleman Street.My preferred time to visit is on a weekday for lunch. Diners are invited to choose from their extensive A-la-Carte menu or the constantly changing (some say 'evolving') Executive Lunch Menu. The Executive menu offers a two or three course lunch at an extremely reasonable price. Even selecting from the offerings on the greatly-reduced range of the Executive Lunch menu can prove to be a challenge.When presented, the dishes are always immaculate and innovative. Service is always that perfect balance of being attentive yet unobtrusive. The location is always unique and inviting. I recommend a table on the wide, covered verandah. It provides cool respite from the oppressive Singapore humidity, or, on days of torrential tropical downpour, it offers a unique experience of being outdoors amidst constant rain, yet remaining comfortably dry whilst dining on exquisite food on tables with crisp, white linen.I have been dining at Flutes on every visit to Singapore over the past few years and have always come away from lunch impressed by all the aspects of this restaurant. It is always a delight to introduce friends to 'Flutes at the Fort' for lunch and take pleasure in their delight at experiencing what is ultimately a highlight in a visit to Singapore

This is a fantastic dining experience. The setting is lovely, in what used to be the old Fire Chief's house, situated behind the current fire station, on the edge of a park. You can dine on the verandas, or inside - which is still divided into separate rooms, so if you are dining as a large party, you can occupy one whole room if required.The service is not overly formal, but is friendly and efficient. The food is wonderful, beautifully presented and well portioned, i.e. enough but not too much. This is most definitely somewhere on our 'to revisit' list

Flutes is set at the base of Fort Canning Hill. It's an old wooden building, colonial in style, painted in black and white and with an open air veranda. The veranda probably had a 'view' at one time but building has now obscured this, but still a great place to sit under a slowly revolving fan and eat.I had lunch and chose from the set menu, rather than a la carte. A la carte looked nice but expensive. The set menu was more modestly priced, without being cheap, although many of the offerings on it attracted a supplement, which always seems a bit of a cheat to me.The food was very good, no complaints, the wine fine. Service was unobtrusive and friendly.Good for both a romantic tryst or business entertainment

A good friend, who had worked in Singapore recommended this restaurant. So before we left home (England) I booked a table for our second night of our stop-over.Well, where do I start in discribing "Flutes at the Fort" The location is superb. It`s in Canning Park, just a stones throw from the city centre, but away from the sound of traffic and sheltered from the gaudy lights of the shopping malls. The service we received from the moment we entered the restaurant was warm and friendly. They had arranged a table on the veranda (a request I had made by email) and ensured that we were relaxed and comfortable. The food arrived in good time and was well presented.If I said, we enjoyed the meal, it would be an understatement. IT WAS ABSOLUTELY FIRST CLASS. We returned to Singapore after a month in Australia and immediately booked a table at "Flutes", and again, it was a wonderful experience.I would highly recommend this restaurant, to anybody how wants somewhere really special. As with all top restaurants, it is quite expensive, but you do get real value for money. Thank you to all the staff at "Flutes" for making us feel special. Also to "Sarah"our exceptionally delightful waitress

Came here with a big group of colleagues, we were very noisy so luckily we had a room for ourselves otherwise would be quite disturbing for other customers dining out there :)love the surroundings of the restaurant, i would definitely love to come back with my husband, it is a lovely place for romantic dinner for sure. The food to be honest is just average, basically the price you paid is for the environment rather than the food they serve

From the moment I called Flutes at the Fort, I sensed that we were in for a great evening. My call was met with warm and professional attention. I could almost feel the smile behind the voice that took my call. The directions given us helped as Flutes can be tricky to find. Their hidden treasure claim has to be taken seriously. Lovely garden setting with lighted trees, an outdoor bar and seating one level up - we seemed a world away. Service was attentive and non- obtrusive - about the best I have seem around town.The food - very good. The cote de bouffe for 2 was outstanding in presentation, taste and value.I was so pleased and writing this brings back the lingering flavour of good beef cooked just right. Good wine list.Will go back - for sure

We had a lovely dinner at Flutes at the Fort where the restaurant is set in a beautiful building, a little way back from the road. We were seated on the terrace and the atmosphere was wonderful; calm and intimate. We were there just after the sun had set and the air had just started to cool. The service was attentive without intruding and the food was very good. I would definitely go here again for a romantic dinner

SettingThe setting is beautiful, an old Queenslander style building on a hill, fairy lights, beautiful.ServiceThe service staff interrupted us in conversation to take our orders instead of waiting 15 seconds for us to see them standing there. We had barely finished desert and all had full glasses of wine when we were again interrupted to be advised that the bar was closing. Shortly thereafter we were asked if we needed taxis. Understandable perhaps if we had outstayed our welcome, but we were engaging in quiet conversation and this was 10:30pm!FoodThe main was smaller than the starter. I had the gnocchi which should have been a delicate and elegant blend of flavours. Well, not when there are big sliced chillis all over the top it won't! My poor wife also nearly lost an eye when I put me fork into a rock hard 'pavlova' only for it to smash violently sending shards flying. (Ok, that was poetic licence, but it was still way too hard).SummaryIt would be nice had it been $50 a head, but for $150? Sorry, no, not even close

We had a very nice evening at Flutes with a group of friends. The seating is at several levels of terraces, all beautifully lit with twinkling lights and with nice views due to the slightly elevated position. We had drinks on a lower terrace then went upstairs to our table. The menu is Australian with some pan asian influences and is all well done. Service was attentive, food was good, atmosphere so pleasant - a lovely evening was had by all. I would go back without hesitation. I would choose it in preference to someplace like Indochine on the water because, even though it does not have the waterfront location, it is not as overwhelmingly huge as Indochine, does not feel like a tourist trap, the food is streets better too

Had dinner there, great to be on the terrasse, very quiet and surrounded by trees.Great service as well, very welcoming staff. And that's about it. Food was tasty but clearly not fine enough for the price we paid. Wine was also quite disappointing even though we decided to go for the upper price range..

For lunch, I love coming here to have a relaxing executive lunch with a nice greenery view. If the weather is cloudy, I'd love seating outdoors. The set lunches here is solid value and you really get away from the maddening crowds everywhere else. The closest proxy to the Botanical Gardens from the business district.For dinner, this place is REALLY romantic. U can even book your own private dining room. Definitely one of my favourite places in terms of food, service and atmosphere.Parking is free too

We were seated next to a group of sloppily dressed but rich foreigners who were behaving as if they were in a pub and not a classy restaurant. They were shouting and laughing so loud, we could hardly hear each other at the next table. We were not the only ones annoyed but the staff just shrugged their shoulders and did nothing.The food was good, but the staff could not answer questions on ingredients etc. They also forgot things that were ordered -- probably distracted by the noisy people. For the price we paid for the meal, it was really disappointing

Situated in a lovely old colonial building, sitting on the balcony you realy could be anywhere the view makes it seem very rural and old fashioned in a very nice way. The service was fabulous. The menu choices extensive and the portions generous, particularly the side orders ( veg etc). My Husband had emailed the restaurant in advance and explained it was a surprise visit for our wedding anniversary, they seated us in a lovely position on the balcony and gave us complimentary champagne on arrival.We then ordered a bottle of Moet having got the taste for it ! and it is very reasonably priced.Also the Chef will happily decorate a plate with your choosen message for dessert time which all adds to the feeling of special service.One small downfall is the heat when sitting on the balcony, they could do with some better ceiling fans, however if you are aware of this you can make sure to dress appropriately!!

My wife and I dined here with friends on a recent trip to Singapore and loved the place. The food was exceptional (we had been away for five weeks and welcomed the chance to tuck into some Australian fare again) and the service was great. The extensive wine list kept the night well lubricated and the atmosphere on the outdoor verandah was great. A wonderfull night!
5
The food was simple but excellent. The terrace is very pleasant and the service very good.

had a perfect lunch, shame on the hot weather if seated outdoors. set lunch is absolutely value for money

Colonial setting. Nice, romantic place. Good food. Pricey.

Very nice experience in total, the outdoor seating was a great setting and gave a nice extra touch to to the evening. Had a full meal with starters and dessert and everything was just delicious. The beaf with grilled potatoes and vegetables (serving 2 people) was my choice for main course and it was nothing I had to regret. All in all very nice, but without being too fancy
5
The food was REALLY good and the service very attentive, asking whether we enjoyed dinner, making suggestions, refilling our glasses etc. Very nice and you feel well taken care of. Menu is diverse, both meat and fish of outstanding quality and very very tasty. Everything just cooked right, great seasoning and beautiful presentation too. If you like desserts, go for the platter with all different kinds. The setting is very nice and unique, right in the park with pretty lights around. Very romantic

During a business trip to Singapore went there with a group of work colleagues. As a vegan we called ahead to inform them of my dietary requirements - due to limited vegetarian options on their menu they prepared a customized dish for me. The caramelized walnut and apple salad to start was delicious. Followed by a vegetable rissotto which was equally tasty. Lovely location - although a little difficult to find (taxi dropped us off at the wrong location so had to walk through the park to get there)

fine but nothing really memorable except location

great setting

the colonial setting is ideal for a nice afternoon brunch

Great view out of the restaurant (unless you get a table away from the windows). Nice food

Celebrated many special occasions here and the owner would always accomodate all sorts of requests to make the dining experience extra special.. Love the outdoor experience at night

Great food, service & atmosphere. Very pricey though- save it for a something special.

It's always difficult to find a good restaurant when you don't know the town and when you spend only a few days there.Try the Flutes at the fort. A really contempory cookink with maturity. Your are here far from the simple mix who a lot of people say "fusion". The chief give his version of the meal and it's right and tastefully. The place is nice , look colonial (maybe difficult to find). The wine list is no limit, coktail menu too

Nice ambience with interesting food. Eating in Singapore with a different feeling.

Good Setting, lunch menu good
2
overpriced

A fine restaurant, but a little overpriced. Yes, the chef's selection menu is excellent but at $98 I'd like my fillet steak cooked medium rare as ordered and not medium. Very nice ambience, and obviously, the trendy, romantic place to be seen, hence a little heavy on the expats, but that's not the restaurant's fault. Both entrees were superb - the foie gras and the scallops. Service was exceptional though, very attentive waiters who suggested coffee in the lounge chairs. Nice to see Mitolo Jester Shiraz on the wine list

Like Au Jardin Les Amis, this restaurant occupies an old colonial building and I just love old houses. Flute is different however in that it has an open terrace for pre-dinner cocktails on a different level from the main dining rooms.The service however cannot compare with Les Amis. In fact I found some of the wait staff to be rather snooty
