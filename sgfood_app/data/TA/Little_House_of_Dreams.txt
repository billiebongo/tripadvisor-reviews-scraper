Excellent staff service. Food was average. Open mic didnâ€™t take place despite being on their advertised.

Good steak and nice cakes... Conducive for family outing as place is not so crowded. After dinner can always catch B&J Ice cream (their sister company) for dessert...

Lovely set up. Sure makes a good venue choice for a lazy sunday afternoon! Food looks pretty, can be a bit more yummy though.

You come here mainly for Ben & Jerry's ice cream. Good thing about this place is that it is spacious so can cater for big groups. They also have a separate counter selling coffee and other desserts as well.

Little House of Dreams has very beautiful, sweet ambience, with white-pink decorations. The cakes, dessert and food presentation are nice. Food wise is not bad. Portion is enough. Price wise is reasonable for a cafe.

Family friendly with a nice ambience. Wide variety of food with kid friendly options, though food was average. Restaurant seemed shorthanded given the weekend crowd.

The laksa pasta was excellent! The prawns were big and it came with a hard boiled egg abd dried beancurd as well. The mushroom aglio, however, was not spicy at all and we felt that it could have more chili padi!

The decor here is pretty interesting - it gives you a princess dollhouse kind of feel. Food is decent, and there are certain promotions running most of the time.

Food was ok. Service was patchy. Some of the staff didn't know what's happening or slow and wasn't good.

Been here a few times. Food is not too bad. Came this time with a chope deal. Get the second mains at 50% off.

My sister and I had a wonderful afternoon tea with my Japanese friend who was leaving for home in Osaka. Staff was most friend. The ambience has a pretty setting. The pastry was especially nice. Will visit again.

Ambience was like that of a dreamy land - my date absolutely loved it and was in love with the surroundings.

I visited this cafe just last weekend with my dog & family. It was fabulous becauze is dog friendly & i love the food there Is slightly on the higher price but is in dempsey hills so you cant expect food prices to be low over there. Ambience is perfect & food is great. Only that they should install more fan on the outdoor as it can be really hot in the noon time

Thank u so much for having such a fairytale theme dining area in Singapore ! Right here in Dempsey hill. I love the range of unicorn related food as well as the colorful macarons. Be here for chilli crab fries is a must for chilli crab lovers ! Suitable for girls day out in the weekdays afternoon

Walked into little house of dreams on public holiday noon time as the other places are crowded. Ordered egg Benedict and salad and two glasses of juices. The juice costed $6.70 before taxes so I was expected fresh juice - it was not, just the packaged juices. The salad came next and it was ok. After quite some time the egg Benedict came, and it came with an ant on the wooden plate (it is not on the food but still it is not nice; you can see it at the lower side of the photo). Taste was alright, nothing special at all. Overall bill was $40++ which is expensive for the quality. Would not come here again.
