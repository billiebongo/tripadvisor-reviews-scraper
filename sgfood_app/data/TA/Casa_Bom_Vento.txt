Stopped off here after food with friends.
Atmosphere was great and staff looked after us well.
I would recommend this place if visiting Singapore.

One of my favourite places in Katong. Have been here countless times and the owners aim to please. A place to go for authentic Nyonya / Eurasian cuisine.

Heard of this restaurant from my mother friend and yes! indeed found it and had a happy tummy in here.The meals was really good, though the space is small but we all like it. The terong and even the sambal makes you wanted for more! They also serves a good curry

There were only 2 of us so we couldn't order very much. Which is a great shame. But we enjoyed the set-our-mouths-on-fire Devil's curry, buah keluak and brinjal with tomatoes and salted fish. The Devil's curry was really good but too spicy to finish. So we had the gravy packed and brought home so we could add our own ingredients and continue to enjoy the myriad of flavours. Finished off the meal with chendol, described as the way chendol should be made with great tasting gula melaka and coconut milk.

The food here is a fusion of Peranakan and Eurasian cultures and is excellent! Enjoyed all the dishes we ordered. To top it up, the host and chef, Lionel, was very hospitable and came out of the kitchen to chat with his customers. He has a passion to keep the peranakan culture alive too

Not only was the food great, but you will be giving an education to your palette! Treat yourselves to the delicious flavours. A delightful experience for myself a local and for wife from Australia. Owner was very accommodating to change some foods to non spicy versions for my wife and made the whole lunch an experience and education rather than just another meal. Highly highly recommend for everyone. You won't be disappointed, drop in for lunch to avoid the crowds!!

My local friend and his family hosted me to this restaurant in Katong last Friday evening.What a surprise...I had never heard of Peranakan food or Eurasian fusion dishes.We had a small sized dishes, shared by six people....this enabled us to sample about ten dishes all told.I may not describe the dishes accurately however every dish was fantastic.The dishes were mutton, beef, stuffed eggplant, omelette with onion, one of my favourites was the Deep Fried Stuffed Tow Pok...with a nice sauce and of course plain rice as well as a fragrant friend rice dish.The mutton and beef dishes were nicely spiced and really good....I asked for some chilli as a condiment,,, Lionel warned me that it was very hot and to add it sparingly. Well, I added it....and enjoyed it very much without any effect from the heat in the flavour.At that point Lionel explained that the restaurant had a speciality dish with a history of over 500 years and was introduced by the Portuguese during their exploration and settlement of parts of the sub-continent, the Malay Peninsula and Singapore.Lionel added that the dish attracted many local dignitaries and regular customers over the years - pictures on the wall attest to it. Lionel suggested that I try the "Spicy Eurasian Debal Curry"....the spiciest dish in Singapore. My local friend encouraged me try as well.When Lionel presented the dish, he suggested that I eat with rice to temper the heat of the spice. He also advised that the flavour would take about 20 seconds before I felt the full effect of the spice.... after 20 seconds I had no "explosion" of the heat.At that point I finished off the dish with great gusto...enjoying it very much...not raising a sweat at all. My local friend tried a small portion...and he felt the blast!Both Lionel, his wife and my friend were in shock that the I had no reaction to the heat.Mind you, afterwards, the Iced Chendol refreshed my palate quite nicely.What I forgot to mention to Lionel was that my family were Anglo-Indian from Madras in the 1850's. The English Soldier married the local Indian lady, there granddaughter was my Grandmother....and my mother was still cooking a mean curry into her early 80's when I visited her in Melbourne until about 10 years ago.I thoroughly recommend this restaurant if you really want something special...be courageous by ordering the "Spicy Eurasian Debal Curry"....you will not be disappointed. Will I be back...yes...on my next trip to Singapore and the next and the next

This is a not-to-be-missed Singapore dining experience. A SG$10 taxi from the central area will get you out to Katong and set you up for a real treat. The food is traditional Peranakan harking back to the original Eurasian influences in the Malay peninsula, hence the Portuguese name. The service was inspiring encouraging those unfamiliar with this style of cooking to try new dishes. All this is accompanied by an explanation from the owners of the history of the food and of his family who inspired him. The Casa is a small restaurant so it is worth giving them a call to book. It is closed on Tuesdays

Singapore has a number of Peranakan (Straits Malay) restaurants, and every one I've eaten at has been good, but this one is both good and a little bit different. Most of them serve Singapore Peranakan food, but the owners of Casa Bom Vento hail originally from Malacca, and the food there is somewhat different, due to the Portuguese influence. I've eaten here a few times, on different visits to Singapore, and always enjoyed my meal thoroughly. I loved their itik sioh (duck in coriander and tamarind sauce), and the eggplant (I forget what it's called, but it's softly fried and covered with a tomato-lime sauce with little bits of chopped up dried fish). Chicken tamarenyo (chicken in chili, onion & tamarind sauce, fairly hot and somewhat sour) is also good, as is the squid with belimbing wuluh (a kind of sour fruit). I don't know if it's just what I pick or if the cuisine tends towards sour, but anyway, it's all good

I nearly always stay along Marine Parade when visiting Singapore, as it's relaxed, a little less commercial and retains a modicum of the 'old Singapore'. Whilst walking along East Coast, I peeked along Joo Chiat Road from the corner and walked passed this little culinary gem - and then in we went, for a wonderfully fresh and flavourful meal.The chef, Lionel Chee, is a lovely fellow and rightly proud of his food heritage - Malay/Singaporean blend - passed to him by his late mother, Mrs Chee.EVERYTHING was delectable - I am vegetarian, and so very much into flavour and spice but also like to taste the vegetables and rice and bean curd - Lionel is a master of fusion, and it was just a wonderul meal.I will be passing through Singapopre again in a few weeks and will dine there again whilst in transit - salivating already!Now, it's a basic little place, very interesting photos and newspaper clippings about the food of the Chee's, so it's all about the food, just the food

Didnt planned to eat here but was attracted by the decor and quaint looking shop. Very friendly host who recommended the dishes. Portion was quite small but great experience of Nonya food

Halal Peranakan dishes...devil curry super hot...delicious but should avoid all the chilli seeds...wendy curry is sweet version..delicious... not dessert or coffee in the menu..quite dissappointed cause the meal was over less than an hour...

Casa Bom Vento was an accidental discovery......and what a find! The food was well-seasoned without being overly spicy, and the flavors and textures delightful. You are able to order portions from small to large, so it is possible to try a number of dishes to share without gorging oneself.Each was delicious. Of the 10 days in Bali and Kuala Lumpur, this overnight in Singapore offered our best meal

Very nice place to eat. We've been here a few times and it never fails to be anything other than great. Two of us shared Chicken Tambreyno, Grilled Baby Stingray, Deep Fried Stuffed Tow Pok, Spicy Kachang Botol Salad and Lime Juice with Rose Jelly with Chendol for dessert. It is very well priced and the restaurant has a wealth of historical pictures and artefacts on the walls I highly recommend it.Sedap indeed

Great food! It lived up to our expectations of authentic Eurasian food. We tried the debar chicken, samba stingray,brinjal and the beef curry. Each preparation was unique and different insofar as one could taste the freshly ground spices in each dish! The ambience and decor was simple and minimalistic which was fine with us as it seemed the owners would rather concentrate on the business of producing excellent Eurasian food! I would definitely return once more Casa Bom Vent

I have been to this restaurant twice and all I can say is the food is fantastic! We tried quite a few dishes and I must say that they were all tasty, delicious and really home-made. The chendol was to die for! I will definitely be back

I made a booking for a large group of us to try out the Peranakan food here. Being of Peranakan heritage, our standards were very high. I must say the food did not disappoint! Very authentic and portions were adjusted by the kitchen to accommodate us. No wastage and everyone ate their fill. Excellent job by the kitchen there. Food was served warm and very quickly. The restaurant is small and cosy so they did a great job fitting all 19 of us in! Service was good considering the size of our group and the fact there were other guests there. Would definitely return again. Thanks for a great night Casa Bom Vento

After reading the reviews on Tripadvisor my wife and I went for dinner. We went early and there were lots of tables available. It was a great experience as all the dishes including the curry paste etc are prepared from scratch. We ordered the debel chicken curry, the baby stingray with curry leaves, sambal brinjal plus rice. The only drawback is the fact that they do not serve alcohol or coffee or dessert, so we had lemon tea and ice water. The food was good and the owner was very attentive explaining the various dishes

This review relates to a planned visit that did not materialize. I had made lunch reservations for a party of 10+ pax about 4 to 5 days before the visit. The reservation was confirmed and reconfirmed on the eve of the day.On the morning of the event, I received an email from the restaurant advising that they will not be able to accommodate my group due to staff issue. Within the short span of 2 hours, and while busy in a meeting, I had to frantically make alternative plans for the group that had been initially advised that the lunch venue was Casa Bom Vento. Thank goodness I was able to find another restaurant that was able to accommodate our big group at short notice.In summary, Casa Bom Vento's lack of reliability has left a bad impression on me. I will not dare to make reservations there in the future given this bad experience

Lots of garlic and spices, but the vegetables were not as fresh as they should be given the excellent reviews I read. We ordered 3 dishes and rice but were completely finshed the first 2 dishes and rice by the time the 3rd dish came (after I reminded them to prepare it). The rice was ok, but not top quality. Also, they did not have any sparkling water, soda water etc. I ordered a can of soda and it was brought out warm, with ice. That being said, the dishes were tasty. We had a garlicy green beans (Garlic Long Beans), spicy hot eggplant (Sambal Brinjal), and an onion omelette (Chinchalok Egg Omelette). I would recommend this place for sure and think it was just an off night perhaps. I'll be back. And hope to write a better review next time.
