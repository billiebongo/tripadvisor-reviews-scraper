Agree that this restaurant is under-rated. They serve amazing kacang Botol and Bakwan kepiting soup. One of the best Peranakan restaurants I have been to. Authentic flavors. Will definitely come back again.

Had lunch there recently and was pleasantly surprised that it was real quality and quite innovative. The cook was able to give good recommendation and this is a kind of place for big gathering of old friends' dinner.

The food was good - not cheap but then what you expect for that kind of quality. What was unfortunate was the service. Not rude, not unpleasant but the staff's unsmiling, glum demeanour made us feel like we were intruding on their private space.The wait staff did little to engage - no "how do you like your food?", "can I get you anything?"For that kind of pricing, you would expect service staff that grasp the basics of dining service.We were practically the only big party there and they started switching off the lights as we were still lingering over our drinks slightly 9 pm. We left without any "thank yous" from the staff. Very weird, indifferent service

Great food, at great prices! Not a fancy restaurant, far from it, but with Peranakan food cooked with such passion and skill, chef Ben Teo deserves every accolade!We had the excellent pig's trotters in buah keluak, ngoh heang, Hae chor, lady's fingers in sambal belachan, squid cooked in its ink, bakwang kepiting soup and two desserts: pulot hitam and chendol. There were 5 of us and the meal cost us $155. I am coming back, rest assured

On Sat only one table of 4 locals having lunch when the we came.Beef Rendang- gravy fragrant but meat tough. Better ones along North Bridge Road's Indonesian nasi padang restaurants. $15++Ayam Buah Keluak- served without the shells as a thick gravy that goes well with rice. However pieces of the shell keep appearing in your mouth (just like egg shell pieces in your scrambled eggs). The 2 chicken thighs were hard and the meat stuck to the bone- use of frozen checken parts? $15++Bakwan Kepiting soup- small bowl with one meatball (one small piece of prawn inside), no taste of crab meat and very few tiny pieces of bamboo shoots. Soup stock not tasty but could not figure out what it was. $10++Nyonya Chap Chye- worst dish of the lot. Carrot, cabbage, soya bean strips, sweet bean curd strips only. No prawns, belly pork, cloud ear fungus, golden needles, bean vermicelli. Cannot get taste of candlenuts, shrimp paste, red chilli and preserved soya bean paste. $10++Chendol- second worst dish. Red beans tasted sour. Packet coconut milk lacks fragrance of fresh. $5++Msg was used a little too much. Salty tooTotal bill $63.60 for two

Came for my mum's birthday dinner. Uncle Ben, the chef himself, took our order. Best Peranakan cooking I've had in a long long time! Not 100% traditional Peranakan but the chefs take on Peranakan food is delicious and we all had extra helpings of rice to go with his tasty gravies. The best food is off the menu so ask the chef for recommendations! We hadYam cake (melt in your mouth)Buah keluak pork knuckle (very generous with the buah keluak!)Assam squid cooked with squid ink (complex delicious gravy)Belimbing pork (seasonal)Stuffed fish (unique and well executed)Chap chye (thick tasty and rich gravy)My dad and I cook and were so envious of uncle Ben's skill by the end of dinner. :)It was sad to see that the restaurant was empty except for us. Please come and tell your friends about this place

Cosy restaurant to dine within Ardennes Hotel along Jalan Klapa. Good Service & Ambience. Authentic taste of Peranakan Flavours. I like the way the Chef brings out the flavours in all his dishes.Their Hae Bee Hiam with belly pork is spicy, aromatic full of flavours & crunchy from the dried prawns. Pork Belimbing was very well done bringing out the spices that goes into this nonya dish. Very fragrant from the lime leaves added to it. Belly pork used is fresh. Oxtail Buah keluat, this is a well prepared & labour dish. Oxtail was cooked till tender and the buah keluat sauce that goes with this dish is heavenly. I called it black gold. I even have the leftover sauce packed & reheat the next day to go with Angel Hair. Yummy. We even had their Bakwan Kepiting-goodness of fresh mince pork with prawns & crabmeat. Soup is sweet & tasty. Very flavoursome. By far one of the best peranakan restaurant I had been t

Peranakan Flavours is located on the ground floor of Ardennes Hotel. Think mirrors, chandeliers and a swimming pool above your head. Now, put all thought of avant grade food out of your head and concentrate on the good home cooked food in front of you. We ate kacang botol, chicken curry, mee Siam, ngoh hiang and carrot cake. My favorite by far was the kacang botol - very nice balance of flavours, if a little sweet to my taste. The carrot cake was fried till crispy on the outside and soft inside, while the chicken curry was full bodied and the spices had obviously been properly cooked out to avoid that taste of raw spices. The ngoh hiang had just the right mix of chunky water chestnuts and a faint liver taste. All in all, I found the food delicious, and the service wasn't bad either

Recommended by a Peranakan foodie friend, I was still skeptical even as I sat down with my family in a hotel lobby. Our starters were the Ngioh-Hain (Stuff meat roll) , Spicy See-Hum(clam) salad & Salad Botol(4 leg Vegetable) which is one of the best and interesting appetizers I have eaten. The See-Hum Salad was very fresh and make with 2 types of sambal and chilli-padi. The salad botol was using young and fresh vegetables with a very nice zesty & refreshing crunch. One of the nicest preparation I have tasted of this vegetable I particularly like. But the highlight dish was the Pork Leg Buah Kelat. This is a exceptionally well prepared dish and needs to be carefully prepared. The sauce over a juicy fresh pork leg will be appreciated and goes very well with plain rice. We also ordered the Sayur Lodeh(vegetable curry) and otak fish which had a layer of otak on a slice of fish. I found out the Peranakan chef was formerly from Lei Garden and actually goes marketing himself to choose the produce. Highly recommend reservations as it is a small seating restaurant. But my mom & I love it

A lady taxi driver told us that Peranakan Flavours is one of the better restaurants in Singapore for peranakan cuisine. We were skeptical to try as the peranakan food in Singapore has been rather disappointing.Peranakan Flavours is a small restaurant within Ardennes Hotel, a boutique hotel along Jalan Klapa. It is located in a small side street along North Bridge Road, just after Jalan Sultan.We went on a Saturday for lunch and ordered beef rendang, meatball soup (bakwan kepiting), chap chye and Ngoh Hiang.After we placed our orders, Chef Ben Teo came to say hello and asked why we switched the Belimbing Pork with Ngoh Hiang. He said that the Belimbing Pork is one of his specialities. We switched it because I am not fond of belly pork.Before our dishes arrived, he presented us with complimentary dishes of kerabu salad and pork belimbing. Kerabu salad is the Malaysian version of Thai mango salad with a distinct tangy and spicy taste, with torch ginger and limau purut leaves. Very appetizing and delicious. So was the pork belimbing!Verdict: The dishes are not in tiny portions (ample and good for 3-4 persons serving). We love the beef rendang (tender, chunky and reminiscent of the sundanese rendang) and the Ngoh Hiang (flavourful and delicious). The chap chye and the bakwan kepiting were rather disappointing IMO. Indeed, Chef Teo's peranakan food is good, and definitely ranks as one of the best restaurants in Singapore for peranakan food. Our meal for 2 costs $70. RECOMMENDED
