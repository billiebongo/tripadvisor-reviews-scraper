Very local hangout and good to bring foreign friends. But price is a little higher than local hawker.
There is also an acceptable washroom at the corner.

We paid S$ 19 for a plate of Thai fishcakes, plus the same for rice, a decision I now know to have been badly misguided. The fishcakes were industrial, rubbery, and disgusting, by far the worst meal we have ever been served, anywhere. Truly revolting. Try little India, for a better welcome, and prices a fraction of this place
4
Best to visit during the Lunar New Year season where the night lights, decorations and festive stalls fill the streets. The food street has all the local food with the oyster omelette a favourite ( shown). Can be very crowded at night leading to the new year
4
I really loooved this place..maybe helped by a new "clothes" to the place as for the celebration for the chinese new year..so in case..I've been lucky to be here in the right time..lovely having dinner here, because you can choose among so many things. Try to sit in the tables out of the restaurants even if the push you to sit at their tables to charge you taxes
4
We stopped here for dinner and we shared mixed emotions. I loved the bustle and the easy to see choices with dirt cheap prices. My wife saw uncleared tales, no napkins,no western silverware no ice and communial eating. We still stayed.She was able to get napkins, ice and a plastic fork from the local McDonalds so that helped.The food we tried came from several different stalls and varied in quality. Beef was the worst. Noddles were the best. My best advice walk around look at dishes actually coming out and pick what you like. Prices can be as low as $3 Singapore for a plate. The most we spend was $10 for a plate of beef

I am a local and have been patronising these stalls since they opened. Originally it was suppose to be a collection of iconic hawker food from various parts of Singapore. However after the renovationl the stalls seem to have gone to the highest bidder. No longer could we find authentic local food of good quality. The stalls are a poor representation of local hawker food
5
This place is local! A must visit for delicious and cheap local food. We have not been here for sometime and dropped in for lunch last weekend. The we had BBQ pork rice and chicken rice and it was delicious. The food stalls are still run by locals and they know how to cook it the traditional way and gives it the local flavour. We will comeback more regularly in future! And, most, if not all the food there looks good. We could have eaten them all if our stomach can fill it
4
My family and I were in Singapore for a holiday and were informed to visit Smith street in China Town. As it is fast approaching the Chinese New Year the whole area was awash with activity and colour. The food court was a sensory overload of smells, tastes and noise and we readily jumped in, even a moody (nearly teenage) daughter seemed to enjoy it. It‚Äôs nearly 20 years since I was last in Singapore and I missed this place last time. If you are here, save some of hard earned cash and get yourself down to Smith street. You won‚Äôt regret it
4
Last night it was raining and was about to cancel my visit to CFS but I am happy I didn'tDon't ask me where was I but I had the best black pepper beef I have had in years, food was good, beer was cold , service excellent and prices down to earth.For sure I'll come back but next time I want to try the famous chili crab
5
Chinatown Food Street is THE place to go if visitors want to try out a wide variety of Singapore street food or local food in general (I mean, who wouldn‚Äôt want to?!). There are more than 20 hawker stalls selling local delicacies along the whole street and we were totally spoilt for choice! My favourite dishes will definitely be chilli crab (order mantou to dip in the chilli crab sauce, it‚Äôs THE BOMB), indian prata, oyster omelette (it matches with the chilli sauce really well), butter chicken, sambal kang kong and satay! The place is open air with a high shelter and lots of tables and seats so it was very comfortable to eat there. There‚Äôs also a toilet at the end of the street so we could clean up a little after getting out hands dirty from eating. Overall it‚Äôs a good experience and everyone should visit Chinatown Food Street at least once when they come to Singapore
5
Variety, quality, quantity, atmosphere. Eat Street has these in abundance. If you like Asian food then this is THE place to find a place that cooks and serves the food you like to eat.
4
I chose Hawkwe Chan to be my lunch. I queued up for 50 minutes to eat my lunch. My meal is Soya Sause Chicken Noodles. I wanted to order Char Siew Noodles originally. But that were sold out. But Soya Sause Chicken Noodles tasted good.
4
Tons of restaurant catering to every price point and every taste, if you like Asian. Some restaurants are great and some not so. The fun and challenge is in the search. Look hard enough and you will find exactly what you are looking for.
4
A tourist attraction, take time to spend 2 hours there, plenty of shops to see and you have to visit for the food and souvenir shopping. Food in most stalls are generally very good. The carrot cake and bbq wings are fantastic! üòÅ
5
This is a paradise for street food lovers .. There are lots of eateries and to find the best bet is the biggest challenge ... we did joint jumping and tried a few things at different restaurants .. more than the food it was the environment which was overwhelming .
4
Its a good food court actually where you can find many Asian food (usually the type you find in this country). Price is moderate. During lunchtime I found most of the tables are occupied. You may have to wait to get your table. You can buy food from any of the stalls and have them here. I liked roasted Pork and rice. Tourists as well as local people come this place. Chinatown MRT is nearby. Chinatown heritage centre is also at a walking distance
5
my fave street foods are available here, and the kangkung is taste great..something rare to find in other place in Sin.The price is quite above the other street food, I thinkthe combination of ancient and modernity the access is easy, close to MRT chinatown and outram parkthe foods here are worth to tast
4
A lot of choices I had the egg and oyster for lunch delicious plump fresh oysters. For a snack I had the Laksa good but the best in Penang.The duck was a big seller as was the chili crabs.Crowded but the ques move fast.A must visit while in Singapore.
4
Lots of other tourists, busy and not very authentic in parts but tasty food. Reasonable prices for the area. Worth checking out, lots of places to eat. Not many vegetarian options but we managed to find a place with some veg dishes - We had Singapore veg noodles and morning glory in Sambol
4
Been there during my Visit to Chinatown at Singapore. Tried Noodles & Spring rolls as the stall i chose was sea food stall and was little sceptical whether i will get vegetarian noodles or not & what it will taste like but to my amaze the food was great But the cost was High.. Must tr
4
If you are looking for Asian street food then this place is must go place but very few options for vegeterians
4
We ate here a couple of times. Chili crab and satay were both good. Juices were not as good as other locations. It is a good choice but the pricing is higher than Maxwell which is down the road.
4
The place is easy to find, there are a lot of food choices, Delicious food and The foods are really cheap
4
This place was full of food, beer and fun! We all enjoyed it as much as we could in Friday night. Price was a bit more expensive compared to the hawker centre but it was ok to us!
5
located not far from Chinatown MRT station, this area has plenty of local food to choose from. if you wish to savor their local dishes, this is the perfect place under one roof.
5
Quite many dishes, all like, every taste is different, winter inflammation steamed fish, sour and spicy, very appetizing a dish, delicious
5
Plenty to choose from - that's the best summary of this place. Nicely covered area with a lot of outdoor and indoor places. All sorts of Asian food with Chinese and Malaysian being the most popular.
1
Don't know Those diners who commented "very cheap" commented a wrong place or consider buy high sell Low as gain situation.TA 4+ rating for this place is definitely overrated.Food is local food, but they are catered for tourists. Prices do not look high in tourist area because portion is small. Actual Prices are higher than local market prices including bak kut teh. BBQ seafood portion is small. $19 large size gongong is just appetiser size. This portion normally costs $8-12 in coffee shop or Neighbourhood hawker. It's not well cleaned. Taste is flat. Oyster size is very small.Only cash payment is allowed. They use alipay Adv to offer coupon and attract tourists, however sellers never apply any merchant device to scan the payment code. What a fake sale.Travelers M√É‚ÄûY walk a hundred meter ahead towards Chinatown complex. You'll know what is real value for $$ at level 2 there
5
Its a place where people buy low cost souvenir , yet you can also find some good quality one , depending on your budget. Here you can also eat. There are lots of choices to select from , ranging from Chinese Food, Asiatic even European . Very affordable and clean Its a fun place to spend 2 hours wondering around and buy something we lik
4
You would have huge options when it comes to food. It was a nice experience since it was not packed with people.We ended up getting the barbecue set and finished it up with a serving of ice kachang.It was nice to immerse oneself in the surroundings
4
One word, GREAT! Good place for local cuisine. So many choices. Lost for words but most important, the belly filled. Even the kids enjoyed it very much.
5
We ordered numerous of food: red chilli chicken, steamed oysters, dried squid with chilli, black pepper beef & gai lan with garlic, were all excellent. One of the stalls is amazingly nice, nothing fancy but worth to really try again next time.
4
We shopped here and had dinner in one of the many restaurants there. The shops sell a wide array of products but a lot of the shops have the same sort of things. Typical Chinatown - one of the best we have visited.
3
For hipsters.Not a microcosm of Singapore's hawker culture as one might expect, this oversold, overpriced travesty of food culture is to be experienced once in naivete, then avoided alrogether. Instead, head upstairs to Chinatown Complex Food Centre, or Maxwell Hawker Centre nearby, where the real stuffs' at
5
It was bewildering to select something for lunch from the array of offerings -- I settled for something representative and unique from the area. It might not have been the most judicious choice, both in terms of taste and nutrient content< but I was really happy because I got to eat something local and unique.Kway teow is made from rice cake strips doubling as noodles with added bean sprouts and dark soy sauce. The cockles added to the dish are very much what the local workers would have eaten. It was so cheap -- even cheaper than the humongous green coconut that I bought to drink with it.Wish I had more time to sample other local fare
5
This is the second times that I came with Friend to try the mutton shop. The soup has a strong aroma smell of Chinese medical herbs. The meat was tender and vein from the bones was soft and tender. The stall established in 1943 from the 1st generation who came to Singapore and the recipes was trade secrets passed from ancestors
4
Our family had dinner here as we had been to Singapore a couple of times before but had never visited Chinatown. We were only on an overnighter so we made this our first and only stop. So many delicious options. We shared a few different things, Dumplings, Roti and Curry and some starters, the Famous Chicken Wings should be renamed to the Fabulous Chicken Wings!!! The Tiger was cold and the service was great. There was a great atmosphere and plenty of people to watch!! I'll be back when I'm next in Singapore for sure!!
3
I love the way Singapore government transform this alley into great food center.I love the ambience, especially at night.The food in the other hand is less delicious, compared to other food center, and more expensive also.I tried fried oyster omelette (from Katong Keah Kee counter), and quite ok.See the photo at my instagram : @adjimantor
4
Traditional Chili Crab is what we searched for... Fresh Chili Crab and the best ever soft mini buns to scoop up all the sauce,... with a sweet condensed milk dip to soften the spice if needed, plus cold Chinese Tsingtao beer is what we found... Wow!, what a satisfying dinner it was I included the restaurant foto with Google street view and GPS coordinates for reference, since I can't read the Chinese restaurant name
4
Stopped at food street for a snack, instead ended up having dinner , service for drinks quick and the beers where cold, order from the stalls and sit and eat . The food we ordered was great two pork and duck dishes and a wonton and noodle dish. All tasty and filling
4
If you come along here stop by for a tasteful dinner. Nice atmosphere as it intends to be a night Food street market. There are plentiful of stands offering different types of food. Prices are not really cheap but still reasonable.
4
Great places to stop and refuel after seeing the nearby sites as there is plenty around this area to see.
4
Most of the Food, were really good at very fair prices.
Everytime, I took a meal, I plan again on going back to try the rest of their menus
4
A variety to choose from! Really good local food. Big serving for 2-3 people as well. It's also an experience to dine in the middle of old shophouses.
5
I was surprise at the sanitary of this place. Way cleaner than I expected. There are several options that you can choose. I had char kway teow and it was super delicious. Wifi is available too!
5
Great varieties. Not many tourists. Cheap and seriously tasty foods. I would recommend coming a few times to try multiple things.
4
Reached around 10 and wanted to grab a nice breakfast. Seats were easily available if you are willing to share tables. Cleaners clear the table very fast.Situated on 2nd floor of a wet market and you can smell fishy and porky smell while eating. Suggest that you take a walk round whole area before deciding what to buy. There are quite many famous stalls here but not all are open for breakfast. There are sufficient fan for proper ventilation and you can easily access via escalator to level 2. From Chinatown Mrt, take exit A, walk towards the left side and it's 2 lanes away. You can easily cut through the shop houses. It's 1 lane behind Mei Heong Yuen Dessert, directly opposite Kay Lee Roast Meat.
5
....we wondered around the streets of Singapore until we arrived at Chinatown Complex and wow what an escapade this visit turned out to be! All the food stall vendors jostles around you to try their foods and eateries! I had already made up my mind to try the Fried Kway Te-ow and this turned out to be a Big Laugh as when i ordered my dish which included a soup the vendor asked me "you wan it whet or dly?" obvious-lii i wanted my soup wet but that's not what the man meant He dumped the soup into the dish with the fried kway teow's and I had to to enjoy a rather a wet'ish lunch! My wife on the other hand didn't trust any food served here we had to wonder around some-more until we found a Cantonese vendor who prepared a chicken dish with lots of cashew-nut in it!...this was indeed a very educational visit so different from the visit to little India on the other side of town!...........A must visit when in in Singapore!!!!...........
5
These are few of the most popular local street delicacies one must try while strolling along Chinatown (Petaling Street). All of them have been around with minimum 3 generations taking over operation for more than 20 years easily in Chinatown same stalls same location never changed. 1. BBQ Salted Duck - must be early morning before 3pm when it all sold out. 2. Wonton Mee - only recently renovated after more than 40+ years. 3. Local steam pancakes - You won't miss this healthy elderly men doing his staff just right outside the famous Wonton Mee shop. 4. Logan fruit drink - sweet and fresh tasty that helps to relieved the Hot weather.5. Beef Noddle - just within few minutes walk around the Chinatown area and it's worth looking for. 6. Soya Bean drink + "Tao-fu-fa"(pudding) - most tourists Will sure drop by have a cup. Bon appetite
4
Meant for tourists only because the food can actually be found at most of the hawker centres of singapore. Tourists not familiar with heartland places will have this chinatown food street to taste local delicacies. Recently upgraded to accomodate many seats. It should be a nice place to sit down and eat and take a break from the busy schedules.
5
Near Chinatown Complex, it is good and ideal for travel and dinner. Good and the foods are delicious. It's recommended.
4
Great experience with so many types of Chinese food available to try. We hit the second day of the 50 cent fest, so all dishes were 50 cents! Some nice restaurants too.
5
Great food for relatively low price. Most of the stalls and small restaurants offer variety of Chinese specialties...
5
Great way to spend time discovering different dishes. Plenty to choose from, make sure you walk it all before you decide. Too many options. Make your way to the end and venture off to the building with hawkers.
4
Our hotel was close so we decided on taking stroll here and were not disappointed. The only problem is there is too much selection. I would suggest walking down both sides of the street before making a decision where to eat. We ate from a number of places and enjoyed the dumpling and satay sticks the most
4
After enjoying street food in Kuala Lumpur, we straight went to Chinatown. there was great selection of food. we always had our dinners there and enjoyed it. If I need to compare it to Jalan Alor (KL), I say Jalan Alor is better. but with all that shopping options you have especially for souvenirs it is a great place to visit
2
We are staying nearby so walked down here to check out possible places for dinner-I thought it looked expensive and completely geared to tourists. We walked on and found a really cheap, local place in a hawkers centre and dinner for 3 including lime juices (and top ups) cost us under $20 (we each had a main and shared a plate of dumplings in Chiili sauce
5
Cheap quality food and drinks. Very accommodating stall holders. No touting allowed so easy for you to walk around. We had a chilli chicken and rice dish that cost 9 dollars. Pretty hot stuff. Bottle of beer and a sugar cane drink was 9 dollars. Spent the evening talking with locals. Top experience Toilets are a bit average and better in the shopping mall. Take time in your selection. Highlight of our stay in Singapore
4
We went through here on our Chinatown walking tour and were told about the 2 types of carrot cake so on our way back to the hotel we stopped by and tried the fried version.Firstly it‚Äôs not Carrot and it‚Äôs not Cake. It is a savoury dish made of white radish.Not bad but probably wouldn‚Äôt go out of my way to have it again
4
We need to search thorough enough to find the stand selling the cheap food. Anyway, it's really a nice place to eat in group of friends and family. For westerners who loves the sun, it's an open reataurant. I would recommend eating in Smith street for its good taste and price. I would recommend porks. Enjoy
5
This place is nice and cosy especially the food is delicious. Worth coming to try out and the staff is kind and helpful
4
It's prices are mostly cater for tourists, but the street style and food choices is the real attractions!
3
We visited here on our first night in Singapore and it was perhaps diving in the deep end straight away! Lots of stalls with a vast array of food however we were the only visible tourists in the market. We met a lovely couple beside us who showed us which stalls we should visit, but after visiting a few other hawkers we would perhaps recommend a few others before trying this.
3
If you are looking to try Singapore local food, there are many other places better than this. I don't know how the vendors got a spot here but I'm guessing it's not because of their food or customer service. I've tried several vendors and the food was not that great, expensive, and the service was LOL
5
Ok so i saw an episode onTV called destination Flavour Singapore.So i made it a mission when i was in Singapore to track down a satay vendor that was featured.Went to Chinatown complex. From the outside if you are a typical tourist you think its an apartment building. But once you venture inside its a true local destination.On the bottom level are the green grocers and fish mongers. Its wet and slippery but you get to see produce that you dont see in your home country. Great experience. Then as you venture up there are local little shop selling clothes etc..The heart of the complex is the food levels. OMG!!!! You want cheap eat and you want to feel like a local then this is the place to come to.But dont expect anything fancy its a hawker centre afterall.Each section has different colored tables so you kow what cuisine you need to look for.So red tables is the way to go to get satay sticks. Store visited was CM SATAY cute little man standing and uses a fan to air the coals to cook the satay sticks in front of you.You can then pick up a can of coke for like $1 or so and across from his stall on the corner is a friendly lady who sells freshly cut fruit and you can pick up a piece of juicy watermelon for like .80 cents as a refresher after your meal.there is a wide variety of food but because this place featured on destination flavour program i mad eit a mission to find it and was so happy that i did.10 satay sticks for $6 and they make their own satay sauce yum yum yum served with a couple of slices of cucumber. Nothing fancy but awesome taste
4
We enjoyed this hawker style food market. It is tourist orientated, but still sells authentic hawker food. Satay, roast pork, wonton soup were all very good.Certainly worth visiting if you are in Singapore for a decent feed in a good atmosphere. For something more authentic and chaotic head to the Old Airport Road hawker centre
2
Expensive for street food, expensive drinks, unsympathetic staff, that's all I can say. And when they dare to ask 30 cent for a napkin when we just ordered $25 beer it can't be true and is it in my opinion just a commercial thing. I was here 15 years ago, everything was quite authentic then, now the whole atmosphere is back to zero.
4
This was my family's first experience at a hawker center. There were so many choices so we made lots of stops to try many different things. The only think I would say is bring wipes for the tables, they were cleaned pretty well but I still felt better cleaning them myself. Also, don't use the bathrooms, you had to pay 20 cents for entry and they were not as clean as I would have expected in Singapore. All in all it was a great experience
5
Chinatown food street is a nice place for me to bring my friends and family over here to have a dinner or a place to chill. Good service for fruit juice stall. And the chilli crab is super delicious. Buy chilli crab free mantou. Good doing business keep it up. Beer cold and good. But most of all the place is beautiful.
5
Prata's are very good at this place specially children like to eat cheese Prata's make different from all other places.Satay as good as at this place specially Newton circus Ahmad Ibrahim satay. All the family likes very much chicken and mutton satay.China Town Crab master for live crabs is totally excellent taste find nowhere in Singapore specially most authentic Singapore Chilli crab.Once at least visit this area must try eating Chilli crab unforgettable. All my family like very much to eat at this place since Chilli crab cooking by most experienced 30 years only crab cooking at this place
5
Yummy carrot cake , delicious sataya and Prata a. A great treat for ur taste buds! Awesome Chinese street foodüòçüòçüòç
5
Nice food,nice people,food environment,especially the fried oyster,nice ice Mac and,chendol,cool beer
4
It's an amazing street. Fried hanging ducks and chickens, spring rolls, rice, sweets, BBQ if you think about it then find it here. The prices are over inflated and shops one block over sell the same for less.
4
Service was good. Seated straight away. Food and drink order taken within minutes. Not the friendliest service, but definitely fast with no waiting around. Awesome spot on the corner to do plenty of people watching with plenty of front tables. Price was good as well. Would definitely come
4
I always look forward coming here whenever I'm in Singapore! There is heaps of local food here to try, and all very delicious and authentic. Not to mention cheap too! It is quite crowded with tourists and locals alike, so finding seats at peak hours can be difficult. Some must-try foods include the Singapore 'white' hokkien mee, roasted chicken rice, oyster omelette, katong laksa and chilli crab! Despite the crowds and hawker-like environment, I'm impressed with how clean the place is!
5
Chinatown Food Street is located in proximity to the Chinatown MRT Station so it is really easy to find. The sheltered street is lined with small stalls selling a wide range of authentic Singapore food such as Laksa, Hokkien Mee, Bak Ku Teh, and Satay. There are also many tables and chairs along the street so we could enjoy our food comfortably. If you want to have a taste of different kinds of Singapore delicacies, do head down to Chinatown Food Street and give it a try
4
We ate here every night! Cheap and generally good. The girls taking drink orders were excellent and remembered us each night, and they had a laugh with us. Great if you like people watching, remember to sit at the tables in the centre, or the round ones at the side that are on the road. many people had the crab and were obviously enjoying it.. we just didn't get around to it
4
As you are roaming through Chinatown you will undoubtedly come across Chinatown Food Street. It is at the intersection of a couple of walking streets so it's hard to miss. There are restaurants lining the streets and venders down the center. After perusing the stands we chose one called Bugis Street Famous Hainanese Chicken Rice, I ordered the Roasted Chicken Rice and my friend ordered the Roasted Chicken with Char Siew Rice. We received our orders and found a nearby table. The chicken was delicious, moist and tender, my friend enjoyed her choice as well.The whole area was clean and void of any foul odors, lighting was subdued but bright enough to see everything. Given the chance I would like to explore this area further
4
All of Singapore's famous food from all over and the most popularly sought after by locals were brought to a single place so that foreigners and even locals may sample them without having to search them out at their hard-to-find local venues. All can be found here and enjoyed under a comfortable setting. The venue was easily accessible and not difficult to locate.
3
This small hawker center some good food options, but is definitely more expensive than the other one that we went to. Instead, go to the Chinatown Complex Food Centre that's just 2 blocks away. It's inside a large building so it's a bit tricky to find, but once you get there, you won't regret it
3
The food was nice but the Maxwell Food Centre is probably more what I was looking for in terms of cheep street food in Singapore.
3
Chinatown Food Center is for Tourist, but not for Local.
Got the Meaning? Means difficult to find Local here, most of the visitor are Tourist.
3
There are so many Chinese food stall here. You can choose whatever you like and whatever you want to try.
4
The food street are located at CBD area and you can find everything about Singapore's famous hawker food here , chicken rice ,stay ,fried oyster, prawn noodles, BBQ seafood,laksa and many more..it's a good place to having lunch.
4
Variety of food is incredible. Everything looks and smells so good. Depending on what you want, you will surely find it at this place. Prices are very reasonable. Very crowded but nevertheless it is a must to see and appreciate in Singapore.
5
Tourists visiting Singapore's Chinatown ought to plan for a meal at the Food Street in Chinatown.It has a great variety of local street food, very clean and cheap. Although it is open air , there is high shelter and fans to keep the place cool. It is suitable for both lunch and dinner
4
Here's where you need to distinguish between two locations which are very close together:-what all the tourist guides call "Chinatown Food Street" is situated in Smith Street between Trengganu Street and South Bridge Road. This section of road is covered with a glass canopy and easy to find. There are stalls selling mostly seafood down the centre of the street and restaurants lining both sides. Be prepared to be touted at each restaurant door and, if you succumb, to get mediocre food at tourist prices;Take the trouble, however, to walk a few short paces from here towards New Bridge Road/Eu Tong Sen Street and you will find yourself a world away in the "Chinatown Complex". This is a local centre with basement wet market, ground floor clothing market, and a large hawker centre on the upper floor. Almost infinite choice of local food at local prices in the food area, be brave and you will leave with a pleasantly full tummy and still have money left in your wallet.
2
Just been there yesterday and patronised the usual Hokkien Noodle and Fried Oyster stalls but now the stalls are being man by workers and not the chefs. Really disappointed with food. I can't even help myself to finish the plate of Hokkien mee and also left 2 oysters on the other plate
4
Located in Chinatown, this is an entire street block where they have replaced the normal center lane of cars with hawker stalls and seating, and then provided covered open-air roofing with fans. So one may comfortably walk up and down each side - no worries rain or shine - exploring the many various hawker stations offering a multitude of food options. I tried the Tiong Bahru Meng Kee Roast Duck station - ordering a tasty combination plate of sliced roast duck and roast pork. Very good. There is then a separate drinks station where you may order anything from sodas to beers. I had my first Singapore Tiger beer here - not bad.The hawker stations don't really get going until around 12:30pm, so be advised - you want to come here for late lunch, or really it's probably busiest in the evenings
4
This is a great food center that has all kinds of different hawker food for sale in charming atmosphere in between shop houses.Right in the center of Chinatown, it has a great location and is definitely one of the more hygienically advanced hawker centers in Singapore and the variety of what you can try in great.Once you have found a stall you like, you buy the dish right there at the stall, pay, collect the food and then go to any one of the many tables alongside the stalls to chow down.I often try the laksa stall with maybe a young coconut juice or a beer. It's all very tasty.If you are visiting Singapore then this is a great place to see all kinds of hawker food and order something that takes your fancy. I recommend taking in China town in late afternoon and then once you are done, head to Smith street for dinner
4
Really enjoyed the food here.
Great to see quality is high and so many different types of food.
All adventurous foodies must visit
4
There are maybe 20 plus places in the centre of the street to select from let alone the more "restaurant " style places alone the footpaths.
Not as cheep as the traditional hawker food places but not anywhere as crowded.
Great value. Spoilt for choice.
3
Stopped in for a quick lunch, pork and rice. Not as cheap as the traditional hawkers markets (in Chinatown Complex down the road) but entirely edible and plenty of room to sit and soak up the atmosphere.
4
This is not your jumbo or no signboard chains, but it has the same dishes at less size and price.
Just fetch a seat and order your food there.
3
An interesting stroll along a street of food shops and stalls, Dont be sucked in by their cheery grin the food is not up to standard at the places I tried.
5
If you want to try the local foods this is the place to visit as you are spoilt for choice. Food is fast and fresh which is great in the hot weather Singapore is known for.The food street is delight for all the senses and being up the road from the night markets it is a great way to spend an evening in Singapore.Definitely allow yourself an evening to visit and sample the foods in this area
4
This place has such a great atmosphere! We stopped in for dinner and had satay chicken, lemon chicken and these awesome rolls that you dip in custard. All washed down with some (reasonably priced!) Tiger beers.It's medium price (if you want super cheap then go to the Hawkers Centre.)Well worth a visit just for the experience of wandering around
5
As a Singaporean myself, I love dining at street food outlets! The Chinatown Food Street is one of the most popular in Singapore at a very central location, easily accessible by the MRT. You find everything about Singapore's signature food here: fried oyster, fried prawn mee, BBQ seafood, satay & more! My favourite store is the BBQ stall which serves a great variety of seafood. Downside of this place is that it gets really warm as it's outdoors and food are quite pricey compared to hawker Centres. Nonetheless, great place to dine if u love food like me, whether you are a Singaporean or tourist!
4
Delightful food market with tastes and smells that may tempt most of us. Highly recommend trying a little different from other stalls, then it is difficult to single out a singel one. Reasonable prices and much good to choose from. You need that privilidge one to two visits.
4
If you want to try some decent Chinese food as well as soak up some atmosphere, then definitely go here one evening. You can get a decent meal for 10-15 dollars per person and cold drinks are available too. There are places to sit and eat, but they can fill up
3
Do you want to try Chinatown atmosphere and Chinese food, these is one of the place in Singapore. Plenty of choices, good dishes and great value.
5
We came here for a walk, and stumble upon a nice dessert: Durian Snow Flake. The price is SGD9.90, but it's a tasty one. Great!
5
Lots of variations. If you're in to seafood you'll definitely love it here! Oyster omelet is a must try! üëçüëçüëç
4
Good place to try variety of local food. All the items are at reasonable prices and the quality is good as well. You can buy souvenirs while taking a walk down.
4
The GOOD Amazing and quick food at one of the stalls at the start selling duck and soya chicken, I'd could eat the food non stop! The sauce with the race was great and lovely flavours in the meat. Great deal for $12 The BAD don't step near Hi! Joyful - we waited 25mins for a sweet and sour chicken dish and it was absolutely horrible. The sauce was gluggy and disgusting. The meat was average and the rice was dry. For $22 this is unacceptable for the quality and they should be ashamed to be serving this.
4
The mith of street food not being good quality and very bad hygiene practices, is blown out the water here. Because as far as I know, and can see, they all have to have a certificate up to be able to trade. Excellent, because of that the food is really good and none to pricy.Just walk about get a bit of this and and a bit of that, really enjoyable
4
My hotel was next to the Food Street so I ate here lots. The prices are reasonable but a lot of the dishes were fairly generic Chinese you can get anywhere in the world. I had to look harder to find Singapore specialities. There is plenty of seating and it is undercover, which makes for a nice experience.
4
If you're a visitor to Singapore, a visit Chinatown is a must and after soaking up the atmosphere and buying some compulsory tack, the food street is a good place to grab something to eat. It's not exactly where all the locals eat but it's a good intro to hawker style if you want to dip your toe in the water
4
We've been living in Singapore for almost two years and love close to Chinatown. We often come here if we're not feeling like cooking. Lots of options, reasonably priced, cheap beer and a nice atmosphere with a good mix of locals and tourists. Also nice if you fancy a walk around the markets afterwards
4
What a great street. Quite wide, lined with restaurants, the food stalls and long tables/seats in the centre of the street. Some of the restaurants have inside seating but most people sit outside - the street is covered so fine when it rains, with large overhead fans to cool things down. We opted for ordering from the stalls, which is simple. They all have large menus, together with photos of each dish, and specialise in different dishes. You order and pay for your meal, from different stalls if you don't both want the same thing, then either watch it being cooked or sit down and collect it when its ready. You don't even have to leave your seat to find a bar, as a bartender will come round and ask what you want and fetch it to you.We went 3 times and enjoyed everything we had. We found that Chinese food in a Chinese food street is not the same as in UK, some of our so-called Chinese dishes are not known to them so you won't see them on the menus. It is all very friendly, sharing the long trestle tables with both locals and holidaymakers and comparing notes on the food
5
Nice cold beers, good selection of food and great spot to chill out and people watch - Definitely worth a visit!
4
This location great for dine because this place open at the evening. The price is low and they have a lot of food.
4
Great area to dine for those on a budget but with plenty of variety for those looking for simple but flavoursome foods
4
Great Street food but if you like fine dining this is not the place for you. The tables are scattered along the pavements and there are numerous stalls to order your food from. It is very busy and it is advisable to find a place to sit before ordering. The food comes in bowls or plastic containers with plastic cutlery. Our meals were very good, dont be put off by the surrounding
4
Chinatown Food Street is a good choice for indoor and outdoor dining. The centre has 'food stalls' and open tables to share and both sides have small restaurants where you can dine in or out. Fantastic choices of food even Indian, we went on a Friday night and wasn't too busy at all, was very enjoyable
3
If you end up in the Chinatown area on a late night like us, this open-air hawker centre is a popular spot for visitors to sample some local Singaporean eats. The atmosphere was busy with queues of patrons and prices are higher than those in the nearby Chinatown Complex Market & Food Centre. There was a smorgasbord of local favorites like Grilled seafood, Satay, Char Koay Teow, Oyster Omelette and Hokkien Prawn Mee by well-known stalls from specific suburbs in Singapore. We weren't attracted to the food served up by many of the stalls but we finally settled on the Oyster Omelette from Katong and Satay from Newton Circus.We found the flavors of both dishes to be comparable to local favorites we'd savored in suburban coffeeshops and hawker centres. They gave us more confidence to taste test others but regrettably we did not have any capacity for the more food. Still it was an enjoyable evening surrounded by brightly lit stalls and friendly hawkers trying to sell their wares
3
We visited this place in an afternoon to avoid crowdedness. The foods there were decent but not in any way outstanding. It√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s expensive in comparison to the neighboring Chinatown Complex Food Center or Maxwell Road Hawker Center. We have tasted carrot cake, Hokkien mee, Prawn noodles, red bean snow ice
4
The China town area is a favorite destination among tourists for souvenirs because of the variety and the price. But never fail to eat at Smith Street when on the area. Our favorite stalls are - kway teo, grilled sting ray and the satay. All these are in the middle stalls of Smith Street. Our family never fails to dine here whenever we have a trip at Singapore.
4
Great food in one of the many restaurant to choose from in Chinatown. Prices very reasonable, portion sizes mean able to share and try a few different things. Large Tiger $6SD can't go wrong. Very busy constantly which we thought was good sign, staff helpful, overall good night.
4
We ate here two nights, both meals pretty good. ~$9.90 and $12.90 for substantial servings (not seafood). Large Tiger Beer $8.50 and bottled water $1.50.Sure the prices are a little higher than some hawker markets but the surroundings are probably a little better too. It poured with rain one evening but we were under cover and didn't get wet.The vegetarian selection is a little limited particularly if you are over the green leafy veg in garlic sauce...
4
This is probably one of the top three "tourist" food centres in Singapore. The usual fare but a bit more expensive than the suburban food centres
4
So many delicious affordable dishes to choose from. Loved the rowdy crowd and the aroma of the food just simply blows me away. Wow. I love chinatown...
4
highly recommended place to try local dishes. the place is covered and well ventilated. a far cry from my first visit in 2006.
3
It's everything you want to eat under the Sun, we chose their roast duck rice, added duck only $8.
The pau, dim sum looks delicious that has to wait till next trip, I am afraid.
4
Whilst in Singapore on a family vacation recently we had the pleasure of eating at the China Town Food Markets.A very large variety of food to choose from and this includes the carts and the restaurants on the side which you can order from and take back to your table. The food was delicious and a hit with our three children aged 14, 13, and 8. If your looking for a great cheap feed then highly recommend here
5
It was really nice to experience this food street around Chinese New Year where all the streets are colourful and there are many activities going on. The food is really good for the price. For me the best sizzling beef so far in Singapore. With generous vegetables added as well.
5
but everyone was very friendly - chinese new year, so very busy.Many stalls to choose from - excellent food.We used the Universal Dining Stall - 3 combinations of meat plus rice - excellent taste, quick service, $12 per head.Great atmosphere, don't miss it
4
We were there just before CNY and it was crazily busy everywhere! There were people queuing for every food stalls but the food was out pretty quickly, guess they are very professional. it could be a bit tricky to find seats so once you are happy , just sit down. It is under cover with some giant big electric fans which help circulating air around. Food is good, fast, yummy and inexpensive. We got some beer there too, just order and tell them sort of where are you sitting, they will come and find you and you pay then. The dinner costed around S$40.- food around $24 and 2 big beers for $16.
5
Great place to visit plenty of choices where to eat . There is so much great food on offer it's hard to choose what dish to choose. We ended up with myself ordering chicken with rice and my wife choosing beef with black bean sauce we shared both dishes which were very tasty
4
It might be a bit stressful getting there considering the narrow street and none existent sidewalk, but the food is worth the trip.There are numerous stall out there but the stars of the show belong to the Oyster Omelette vendor and the Roast Pork stall beside it.Finding a seat is easy, and the Aunties always make sure the tables are clean.Forgot to mention, food is cheap here. Meals cost from $10SGD to $20SG
5
Chinatown food street is definitely worth a visit. Great variety, good food and cheap. Even some good options for vegetarians. Friendly and vibrant and the prices are good too.
2
Very disappointed at the meal my friends and I had here. Food centre just a block over has tons more options at much better prices, and most importantly, taste much better. This is just a tourist attraction.
5
This place has such a variety of food to choose from and is an experience we recommend. Good luck deciding what to order with all the choices.
2
This place is likes food court without aircon. Ambience is ok if you like to dine in the open with lots of activities. During busy day, tables are dirty and no one seems to clear the rubbish. Food is ok but depends from store to store
3
I am glad I visited Chinatown in Singapore. The place is alive - the sounds, the smell - the bustle. There are bargains everywhere. The food is very affordable. And the merchants are very helpful as well. Of course it doesn't hurt to purchase something first before asking for recommendations or directions
4
We went here as was recommended on trip advisor and were not disappointed. We ordered our food from stall number 10 and had stir fried beef and rice and stir fried seafood and rice. We were not disappointed. Both dishes were very tasty and great value for money. I would not hesitate to revisit
4
Authentic, fresh and very tasty offerings from an array of food stalls. Quick service. Reasonable prices for good quality. Lots of communal seats. Drinks bar with beer and cider. Wondering how they make the chicken wings sweet and sticky on the outside and savory salty on the inside. Yum
4
This street has heaps of options that took us a few passes to decide what we wanted.We got a little confused on where to order what we did decide on though because stalls would advertise their menu down the street from them. And the BBQ stall didn't have the sticks we wanted.But the quality and price of the food are pretty good! We really enjoyed our meal here and the prices shocked us in a good way.This was a great end to a stressful day
4
My cousin introduced me to this place which is also near to souvenir shopping destination in Chinatown. This hawker center has a lot of food retailers to choose from, but choices are limited to Chinese and Singaporean food. It's less pricey but has generous serving. Tourists and locals enjoy dining in hawkers like this
1
For Singaporean like us √Ø¬º≈íit total rip off , every thing is over price , most of the cook are from China on work permits the food taste really bad ,advise to tourist , the best Singapore street food are found in local food center ,when most hawker are Singaporean , food price reasonable when Singapore is already one of world most expensive city , if you don't need to eat there avoid this street , go to Kallang airport food centre instead 
4
This was one of our destinations for our food trail. Stopped here for some chicken Satay and BBQ king prawns!
Delish!
5
Any visit to Singapore would not be complete without a visit to Chinatown. Hawkers selling a range of products and food spread over Smith and the surrounding streets. Taxi, bus and train/MRT access all options. Strongly recommend a visit to 'Chinatown Seafood', a favourite.
4
There are many stores on this street I rank the 3 must eat :1) Laksa Ah Tee Famous Prawn noodle ÈòøÁ¨¨È¶≥ÂêçÂ§ßËù¶È∫µ2) Oyster OmeletteKatong Keah Kee Âä†Êù±Âä†Ë®òË†îÁÖé3) Hainanese Chicken Rice/ Bugis Street Famous Hanianese ChickenÊñ∞ÊòéË∑ØÊ¶ïÂüéËÇâÈ™®Ëå∂Enjoy and please vote for me if you find this review helpful
4
I had gone shopping in the cheap and cheerful shops around Chinatown and decided that I really did need to stop off in Smith Street - the original Singaporean Chinatown food street. I ordered 10 beef satay at one stall and a reasonably priced large bottle of Tiger lager beer at another one. Balancing all my purchases I just made it to one of the many tables and simply devoured everything with relish. There is nothing that you could describe as haut cuisine here, but for pure, local atmosphere you can't go wrong. If you're visiting Singapore you should try to get here
4
I wasn't intending to have lunch here, however Maxwell Hawker Centre was packed with people and Chinatown Mall Hawker Centre was closed for cleaning, so I decided to give it a go.I've been meaning to try murtabak for some time so when I came across Stall No. 18 which sold Indian food, I thought this is my chance.The two gentlemen serving were friendly and helpful. For S$7.00 I received a huge serving of chicken murtabak, curried potato and curry sauce to dip the murtabak into.Being the first time I've tried it, I have nothing to compare it to, however it was very filling and I enjoyed it
4
A 'must visit' whilst in Singapore the street provides a real wide range of foods, obviously all with a Chinese emphasis.I had a wonderful arrangement of crispy duck and pork whilst me companion had a selection of seafood from a near by vendor. You can then choose the open seating and tuck in. Great food at great prices
4
Many varieties of hawker food available. In addition there are many small restaurants for different taste buds. Cleanliness was good as the cleaners were hardworking and nice.For the good price, you will get tasty and nice food. Atmosphere is good. Big fans to cool you down with sufficient roof coverage above.Enjoyed the XO fish head beehoon, fried hokkien mee and bugis chicken rice.
4
My friend in Singapore is originally from the North East of China and eats at the "North East Mom Chunbing" from time to time.We had some interesting dishes - Chinese Beef Pie, a pork dish with vegetables as well as corn and corn pancakes. We also had a dish with a soft bread with pork mince and vegetable made into rolls - really tasty - plus we had fried roasted peanuts - a favourite of mine.There is inside and outside dining - the staff are friendly and meal was good value.My friend and I will return another day - there are so many dishes to try
5
I visited with my family and we had a feast with the huge selection of local hawker food options available! Food was delicious and staff were friendly to help us with our orders! Love the old school songs played and the breezy outdoor ambience too! I recommend this place if you are looking for goof food, a place to relax and take a break from a day of shopping
2
Having tried 3 Hawker centres, it was time for Chinatown's Smith Street which has about 20 stalls in the middle of the street and restaurants lined both pavements. There was 1 roast duck stall (see picture) and a sizeable queue, so I thought this must be THE place for roast meats and I duly joined the queue. Big mistake! I tried the 3 meat combo for Sing $15. The crispy skin pork was good, and a good balance of meat and fat; the duck however was pretty bland in taste and as for the BBQ pork - yuk! It should be pork fillet and yet moist when cooked. This was far too fatty for me and if I had to say, it was 40% meat and 60% fat, much of it stayed on the plate. Not only that, it was pretty tasteless and probably the worst interpretation of this dish I have ever tasted from a specialist Cantonese place. My noodles (Sing $1.50) were decent enough as it was well seasoned and my vegetables (Sing $5) were ok, nothing special. Looking around me, there were probably 200 restaurants in the immediate area selling good looking duck and pork and I had to choose that one. The stalls at Maxwell Road and Lau Pa Sat were far superior to this one! Maybe I was unlucky as there were 19 other stalls to choose from but from that experience, I moved on
4
Lovely and busy street with lots of restaurants to choose from. Maybe a bit touristy. The food was good and service was extremely fast. We ended up having dinner her twice during our stay in Singapore.
5
I had one of the best fried oyster in SG here. Great selection of food from all over SG and Asia. Most stalls have some form of culinary award
1
We found a table after looking for a long time and wanted to sit down only to be told it is dripping from roof. We queued to buy tea, coffee and milo and was told 'no hot drink, next!'. üò£
2
There are better choices just down the lane to Chinatown complex! There is cheaper & more choices! This place is only for the tourist! Not for locals!
5
Great value from the kitchens on the street - not so much the restaurants in the buildings, although they had AC
4
One of the best areas in China Town to have a meal. Lots of available options. In my opinion the stands in the centre of the road serve better quality food than the restaurants.
Too many options available.
5
Great for early evening meal. Great selection of Chinese-Malaysian-Thai food and beverages. Price range from budget to highly expensive up to your preference. Loved crispy pork noodles and Cantonese stir fried noodles.
3
At the intersection of Trengganu St and Smith St, is the start of the Chinatown Food Street.The street that is lined with restaurants that offer some of Singapore√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s most popular local dishes.It is also a nice place to relax with a beer in between shopping
4
I traveled here just to try this Michelin star 'street food' in the Chinatown Complex. The one everyone raves about Liao Fan which sells Hong Kong Chicken on rice. How great was it? Well it was exceptionally good value for money and very tasty. Worthy of a Michelin Star?Come on, it is like the Emperors new clothes. BUT enjoy the hype and get stuck in there and give it a try. I traveled from the UK just to try this (and a Singapore Sling in Raffles) and thoroughly enjoyed every minute and made a new friend in the hour long wait who traveled from the US to do the same!
4
So many choices. We actually got off the street and into the Hawker center. Chicken Rice (you gotta eat it), crab, etc. were our choices that day. Be sure to look for the drink stands in the hawker center - your food vendor will not necessarily sell them
5
I have the best dumpling in China town street stalls
Simply delicious and cheap
Do visit and is totally safe to you to eat and drink
4
Fabulous Food from the various stake holders
clams in bamboo - stand out
Quick Service and very reasonable.Good value for Money
3
Here is a lot of chinese people did business here. Price depend how you bargain but they are not so friendly. Some of them are easy to get angry so be careful and as usuall, watchout your wallet.
3
This is an open air type food place with a shelter, lots of food places to choose from and lots of different types of food and a wide range of prices, seafood heaven if you like crab!
5
We stayed in chinatown and ended up eating here three of the four nights we were staying there. The food was so delicious and there was a lot of choice. I am a vegetarian so I found it a bit harder to find food as a lot of the food here is meat based but there are still plenty of vegetarian options there
5
If you can't find something you like here - give up! Although I didn't see French Fries! What a lovely change!We ate here several times during our visit as we liked the atmosphere of tables everywhere - you put a tissue packet on the table to reserve it, then go off to get your food from any of the huge amount of stalls and come back to your table, waiting for you. We found this to be the most economical place to eat also.The best laksa was had here and even tried some new things like Patak - and got to watch the cook toss the dough around until it was paper thin before filling it with your choice, folding and putting it on the grill - served with Indiah curry dish and pickled vegetables. Great value for under S$10.We picked our own crab and had Singapore Chilli Crab. Not so cheap - our crab was S$50 but served both of us. Nice, but could have had a bit more bite - perhaps they took pity on the Westerners. Drinks were purchased from separate stalls again - a bit of a nuisance, but bearable. A great variety on offer
3
Maybe I just lucked out when I visited, but the soy sauce chicken rice dish I ordered was SGD$7.50, which was by far the most expensive chicken rice dish I ordered during my stay. Nothing too wrong with the meal itself, but prices are clearly vary depending on where you go
4
Singapore's Chinatown has hundreds of restaurants contained in its relatively small five-block perimeter - Chinese, Malay, Indonesian, Thai, Japanese, Vietnamese, Nonya, and western.But it is Smith Street, one of Chinatown's three main streets, that has earned itself the title of "Chinatown Food Street".Apart from establishment restaurants, Smith Street is strewn with food stalls offering an amazing array of Asian food delights, all of which are at reasonable prices and which you eat at tables and chairs set throughout the street.A huge plexiglass awning has been built over the top of Smith Street to protect you from the rain, but which still allows a free flow of winds and breezes (hopefully) to help cool you as you eat and to blow away the fumes of the numerous barbecues and charcoal braziers
5
A massive choice of fish and meat menus from all the local street hawker stalls set out down the middle of the road. Tables are open air, the good is cheap and delicious and is an authentic taste of Chinatown. Be brave and try something new!
2
I have been here many times and other than fatty wangs on the corner I wouldn't bother with the restaurantsThe street food is good but these are not the restaurants on the edge of the street.Be careful as the food doesn't appear fresh and its small size for the price. I have been to 4 of these and have given up on themWe went and was encouraged by the $5 beer. We ordered lamb ribs which was very fatty cheap mutton off cuts We ordered prawns with broccoli and it came without broccoli and the prawns were frozen. We ordered crispy skin chicken and another chicken dish came without the salt and the chicken seemed OK but again not what we orderedThe girls are very helpful and pleasant but it's the food quality that disappoints.Again very disappointed so I recommend eating at fatty wangs or the order yourself food market in the middle which is cheaper but okI don't recommend the restaurants on each side as it appears to be a tourist churn and burn plac
4
Love the place and the food but especially the Tiger. Day or night a great place to be even with the humidity - hence the justification for 'more beer'..
5
It was a great place. Even though it is a street, there was a high roof with huge fans. Food was good though limited options for gluten free food.
3
Centralized street-style food vendors. Basically Chinese culinary spectrum. It is clean and neat. However the food is pretty much standard and still behind the famous Jalan Semarang food street in Medan, Northern Sumatra, Indonesia.
3
We were visiting Chinatown and walked into Chinatown Food Street. It is clean and lots of tables and chairs to cater for large crowds. Food is delicious but could be pricey being tourist attraction.
5
I love all the food choices!! There were just some that's quite expensive maybe because it's for sharing serving.I ordered Char Siew & Prawn Mee Soup since I'm really starving from the walking. Both were so delicious! If only my tummy can still accommodate more foods, I'll order more.This place is really a definitely a must to visit
4
Well, a location called "Food Street" in Singapore seems to deliver on exactly what it promises. If it has been cooked in the Far East, chances are you can probably find it on this road. From Peking Duck to Dim Sum; from Malaysian Curry to Korean Barbecue to Vietnamese Pho, you are spoiled for options when traversing Chinatown in Singapore. There is an odd assortment of restaurants, bars, and street vendors, and they are all in collaboration meaning that you can pretty much take any food anywhere within reason. Bars allow you to bring street vendor food in, and restaurants allow you to take dishes outside to eat with your friends as they snack on an eclectic mixture of hawker food. If you are in a big group, all the better. You can order one thing from each stall and share it all to get a real sense of flavours. Unfortunately, we were only a pair; so we went to the duck stall to get a roast duck with noodles, and a seafood fried rice with grilled stingray from Boon Tat Seafood Barbecue.The duck was simply prepared when ordered, but the seafood place cooks upon order so that took a bit longer. We had finished the very good duck by the time the vendor brought me my order. We had begun to worry that we would not receive it after having paid for it, as the stall was out of sight, but he found us easily enough.The stingray. Wow, the stingray. It tasted unlike anything I have eaten previously, and had a fantastic texture cooked perfectly into a nice spicy Singapore sauce. At $18, it was one of the more expensive offerings, especially compared to the $6 duck (prices vary dependant on stall), but I unwisely balanced it off with a small portion of the seafood fried rice. The stingray was filling enough alone, so be warned if you get rice too - but the rice was good; some of the best we had in Asia and fried with some lovely cockles and crab pieces. Washed down with an average-priced bottle of Tiger from the drink stand, it made for a nice lunch at a decent price for the expensive city centre of Singapore
4
This place has a lot of food varieties and the environment is clean.For the price paid, we consider the food as reasonable but not very cheap. Some food are mediocore but some are really nice .e.g the fried carrot cake and the oyster omelette.A visit during the afternoon is not recommended especially during a hot sunny day as even though there are shades and fans, it is still unbearably hot in the afternoon
4
For two nights my family and I went to the Chinatown food street which was located near the hostel we were staying. We went there because my kids love Chinese food. The main reason I went there is to look and try the famous Hainanese Chicken Rice. The food experience was great, the prices were reasonable and the place was clean. Even if it is raining, the place has a roof to protect you from the rain
3
The food street is clean and with variety of stalls and restaurants along the street. Some of the stalls are famous food stalls around Singapore and open their stall here in Chinatown food street as well. We ordered grilled Sting ray, fried baby squid, oyster omelette, fried keoy teow and chicken and mutton satay. The grilled sting ray were not really grilled but looked more like being steamed before and just put the spicy sauce on top. Fried baby squid were nice but we didn't like the sweet tomato gravy that came with it. The Oyster omelette tasted average. Fried keoy teow was on the sweet side and we didn't like it. Chicken satays were not cooked through and we had to return to re-grilled. Overall the foods tasted average and the prices were high for the quality of the food. We will not be back again the next time when we visit Singapore
5
Whoever gets the chance to spend a little time in Singapore, will for sure stroll along the aisles of China Town and visit the Buddha Tooth Relic Temple. Just across, you will find the city√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s biggest Hawker Center, which offers the widest range of treats at more than 260 stalls. The meals are cheap. You can get Chicken Rice or Laksa starting from 2,50 SGD (1,69 EUR)
5
nice place to try if you are food aficionado... But only 1 Indian vegetarian option is there and that too cant guarantee if his stall would be open or not...
2
Watch the pricing at Stall 18! It's a rip off. Same food further up. Just as fresh but significantly cheaper!!!!! Wish we'd looked around a bit more.
4
Good street foods for tourists. The prices are reasonable while food quality is aceptable. This food street √≠s near by MRT station so it's convenient to go there from anywhere in Singapore. You should try it!
5
The best sea food. Chilli crab was absolutly brilliant. Plus cold local beer and incredible storm. You shuld try it.
5
You may have to wander around a bit to find it (I don't remember the number of the stall), but it is so worth it! The couple sells only popiah and they make them right before your eyes. They are on the first floor, somewhere in the middle. The best popiah we ever ate! 3sd for 2pcs. The guy who got the michelin star is also in the building, but this one deserves a star as well
5
If you want to taste the real street food...i recommended to visit chinatown food street with hungry empty stomach, because the foods are fresh, cheap and yummy, I have tasted the Duck Roast, with oester soup, as muslim I am resist to taste rikshaw noddles and other hum items...but it looks spicy and hot..........
4
There are many types of very good, authentic & cheap food to be found in Chinatown Complex Market & Food Centre. This is one of them.The owner is a middle age couple. It is a simple stall set up & they offer limited dishes on the menu (shown on display board). But it still has still sufficient choices. Food is good. Offers excellent value, which one can rarely find elsewhere nowadays in Singapore.For $4, one get a big plate of nice Hor Fun ( a local favourite- fried noodles with gravy & seafood). It comes with 3 very large prawns, fish fillet, mussels & meat.Absolutely cannot find such excellent value anywhere else in Singapore. And it tasted good. Similarly for other dishes too.You can see many regulars coming here to eat. Certainly this is a stall you do not want to miss - for good local food at really excellent value
4
This place is really cool. Its outdoors but has really high roof in case it rains. Its a hawker centre but with a bit more panache than some of the others. Quality of food is always good and the choice is awesome, plus the Tiger ladies keep you topped up with cheap (for Singapore) beer.
4
You need to go back and forth couple of times to be able to make up your mind...lots of different food stalls and lot of choices. Some just have outside sitting, some have inside air-con tables. Typical China town atmosphere, from cheap to medium prices. You probably don't get the most sophisticated food but good value for money.Definitely worth to try
3
The Smith Street is where you find this place, just adjacent to Pagoda Street.Visited during Chinese New Year and the place is all lit up with Monkeys and the crowd was huge. There quite a lot of options for the Non vegeterians and if you love seafood. It's an open air seating with roof and fans placed. Not much choice for vegetarians - one may try the Roti Pratas at Serangoon Raj Indian cuisine. Nothing to boast about but if you are a vegetarian, you are just the odd man out
4
I have been several times. Last visit we had BBQ squid with spicy sauce and BBQ mixed veg, Hokkien mee noodles and chicken satay.
3
Chinatown Food Street was recommended by many as the place to try local cuisine. I was shocked to find out that the price of the food was so high as compared to the food centre nearby where the varieties are the same.
4
I've been to China towns all over the word & generally they're quite dirty, mean & nasty.
But in the true flavour of Singapore, this china town market street was REALLY nice.
Definitely worth checking out :)
4
hundreds of menu here to choose. Come and choose 2-3 menus every meals, you'd need more than 1 week to complete
5
Stopped in for a bite after shopping in Chinatown. We tried chicken laksa and some dim sum which were excellent!! Also tried fresh mango juice which was refreshing on such a hot afternoon.

Interesting for the average tourists who can find a variety of local food/snacks in one place. Easy to order, self-service style. Seating is no problem but don't expect authentic regional cuisine. The much tout about Chilli crab was a disappointment at S$40 per crab. There's nothing special about the sauce,but there are lots of other stalls selling their own version so maybe we just picked the wrong vendor

Smith Street in Chinatown is essentially a food alley with not only typical restaurants but also the stalls on the street. You don't have to worry about vehicles, just people. There is plenty to choose from, obviously leaning toward Asian, so you need to take the time to check out what each restaurant or stall is offering. We focused on the stalls, small but mostly uniform units. If you keep your eyes open you will find a few sinks that you can wash your hands at. we had Char Kway Teow with seafood and chicken from street stall #8 as well as roast duck with noodles from another stall. you buy liquids at specific stalls. tables are available on either side of the stalls. The street does have a cover that keeps most rain out but allows plenty of sunlight though that also means the humidity is present. i would say this or another street food mall is something to partake in at least once. honestly, with so many eating opportunities available in Singapore i probably would say one visit here is enough. while you are in Chinatown, though, go ahead and check out the shops. easy access from HOHO bus or Chinatown MRT station

Went with a couple of friends for dinner as we had craving for local food.Was on a weekday and not to crowded. Thought it maybe hot but the ventilation was not bad.We ordered hokkien mee, fried oyster which were good. Stingray, gong gong and sambal kangkong was not bad too. But the chicken wings was a disappointment. Prices are not that cheap though
3
Depends what you select as some dishes are not up to standard.We had beef noodles and it did not taste good at all and its expensive.The yong tau foo was ok but not great but certainly better than the beef noodles.Wanton noodles were way better.The food&drinks here were over price
4
Smith Street was renovated a couple of years back and converted into a covered, all weather food street. Hawkers' food galore! Too many to list and some were very good. Prices were a little stiffer than regular food courts but this area is clean, fan whirling high overhead and quite touristy. It is hidden between souvenir streets in Chinatown but parallel to Buddha Relic Temple. So it is not difficult to find. In addition to hawkers' food, there are so many restaurants on the left and right. Be early or late if you intend to eat dinner. It is always crowded
4
So we went 6 of us, we ordered crunchy anchovies, cold drunken chicken, sambal kangkong, and chinese pork belly.
Combined with two large Tiger beer. It was awesome!
4
This place I like to go everytime when I am in Singapore , you have a lot of places there to eat and drink all kind of food with not a lot of money also you can look around .
5
This is one of the most amazing hawker centers in Singapore. Amazing satay and laksa. Make sure you bring tissues.
3
But no single one stands out. I had tried a few of them, did not find any stand specially need to be repeated.
5
Well worth a visit in Singapore, the street food is excellent, great atmosphere, inexpensive. Lots of shopping, or just a place to watch the world go by.
3
Good variety of local delights but very touristy. Good experience but not optimal quality as all franchised street food are. Be mindful of rain.
3
Went into the place after seeing the Trip Advisor board at the entrance. This was after shopping around at China town. The time was around 8.00pm. In spite of being a week day it was crowded. We ordered sea food mixed fried rice, devilled pork, sweet and sour chicken and stir fried vegetables. They had the famous Singapore sling at 18 dollars which was considerably less in price compared to the Raffles at 65 dollars. However incomparables should not be compared. The proportion of Gin was more. Very quick and good service. Can go with the family
4
This area is full of shop selling souvenirs and gadget accessories as well as food. I came here at 10pm and the crowd is still there.The good thing is, it is cleaner compared to food court in People's Park. However, it is slightly more expensive because this is tourist area. You know, everything become more expensive when it comes to tourist in Singapore.Make sure you do not need toilet service while here. The public toilet is located far away without toilet papers
5
yu can be nostalgic Indian pining for home food adn a die hard China resident wanting homely food, this is place to visit. the middle of the road is filled with Kiosks rustling up food made to order and the pavements are filled with tables and chairs. Good variety and clean wholesome food with good liquids to wash it all down. Give it a try. Like my daughter says YOLO
5
If you're in the Chinatown area, there's a food stall street that should be on the visit list. It's not massive but there are enough stalls to provide some variety. There's also plenty of seating space that is covered for when it rains (handy, as we found out!). Alcohol is also available. We only sampled one stall (pictured), and the food was excellent
4
Just had a quick takeaway lunch, mine was not what I had hoped for chicken was tasteless a little disappointed. Hubby and our friend enjoyed their fish and beef from a different shop.
4
We always stop by our favorite place for a beer or two and a couple of plates of great seafood dishes. A nice break from the heat of the day and a place to people watch.
4
there are plenty of stalls to choose from very reasonable prices good atmosphere with good variety of diners i will definitely visit again.
5
we stayed in Chinatown so ate each night in Food Street. The choices seemed endless and the drinks were easy to come by with very friendly waitresses at your call.
It was so much fun trying different foods
3
The street has atmosphere with many low cost 'street food' restaurants and people seeking out customers. It is worth a walk through but there are probably much better food options around than what was offered here .
5
Either you stay in Chinatown or not, this place is a nice place to check out many different dishes of Singapore with its various influences. There are many stalls to choose from, and if you come with a group, you can sit wherever you like and bring foods and drinks from different stalls to your group's table and enjoy them together. Prices are a bit more expensive than some food stalls I've found in non-touristy areas, but the prices are still good enough. I ate chicken rice and drank a glass of lychee tea for less than S$10
3
This food street is highly visible as it is situated within one of the 3 main streets making up Chinatown street markets. It takes up about half the space of Smith Street.The food is generally average & one can easily guess that this place is for "tourists." Ambience is nice though.For cheaper, more authentic & much wider choices of good local food - go to the nearby huge food centre at 2nd floor of nearby Chinatown Complex ( located at about 50 metres away on same Smith Street.This place is where the locals go to; for cheap & good local food.It's quite common to see tourists eating at this place. Of course, this place is not as nice as the Food Street but it is still comfortable. If one just want a nice place to take a break & relax,have a coffee/drink ( like we did); then Food Street will be preferred.But if cheap & good local food is what one desired, then Chinatown Complex food centre is definitely a better choice
4
I dine here often when passing through Singapore and am never disappointed. The choice of food is huge and whilst once in a while you might be disappointed by a plate of food, the standard is generally very high and most people order from more than one stall. All the dishes are incredibly good value compared to eating elsewhere in town. The only gripe is that the choice of drinks does not match the choice of food.The street is air conditioned but sit beyond the awning and dine in the open air in the humid Singapore night. Forget the usual perception of street food, hygiene standards are as high as any restaurant
5
If you are looking for anything from a quick snack to a full on meal in the midst of shopping or after a hard slog through the markets, this is the place to go.As much variety of Asian food as you could wish for everything from vegetarian, through meat, to seafood, including huge numbers of stalls each selling the "best" Chilli crab.Just grab a table, order food and off you go. A good meal and tiger beer makes for a great afternoon
4
Great place for first time visitors to experience a variety of local dishes at reasonable prices, There is an overhead ceiling encompassing the food street that protects visitors from rain and the place is kept cool by large ceiling fans.You can truly experience a gourmet feast here.There are many restaurants alongside the food street but the prices for food charged are very much higher as these restaurants provide a sit down dining experience with full service
4
This is a huge mishmash of authentic cantonese food and tourist traps. Do your research and you can come away with a really good meal
4
Great selection of cheap food. I've eaten here a couple of times and really enjoyed chicken curry noodles and Laksa. I will certainly be going back.
4
The Chinatown Food Street is really something different from what I have seen. It has become really something special. You must go there and eat one of the many specialties offered.
4
Enjoyed the atmosphere a lot. Many tourists trying all kinds of Singaporean food. Great varieties but of course can't compare the quality of the food with Maxwell market or Chinatown Market. Pricing is on the high end.
4
The Chinatown Food Centre embodies the best food Singapore has to offer. Here is a place that devoted locals attend on a regular basis, yet very few tourists manage to find it even though it is at the end of one of the most trodden tourist routes in the city.There are ‚Äòhawker centres' and ‚Äòhawker centres' in Singapore. I learnt from experience that if you choose a real one, that's frequented by locals, you'll find authentic dishes and a warm welcome as a novelty visitor. If you choose one that attracts tourists it's a very different story - touts push you in every direction and there's a sameness about many of the dishes on offer. The Chinatown Complex Food Centre is one of the real ones. Despite the lack of tourists, most of the 100 or so stalls have English signs, making it easy to order, even if you can't communicate in words. Here are our highlights from recent visits, Tian Tian Pork Porridge , (This is a porridge not to be missed.) ,An Ji Famous Fish Head Noodles , Nui Che Shui Famous Glutinous Rice , Fish Ball Soup Stall , Xiu Ji (Ikan Bilis) Yong Tau Fu , (is a bowl of soup with various types of the best tofu you'll ever have eaten. Don't miss this stall. It's fantastic.), Lian He Ben Ji Claypot , Terry Katong Laksa , If you're not staying in Chinatown, catch the MRT to Chinatown station. You can't miss the sprawling white building in the vicinity of Smith St. The hawker centre is on the first floor, there are general market stalls on the ground floor, and there's also a wet market in the basement
4
Very short walk from the Chinatown MRT Station. A large variety of food available from the various stands lining the centre of the street. Ate here several times on our visit to Singapore. The street is covered, so we were able to eat while waiting for the rain to pass one day, while the huge fans in the roof kept us relatively cool. Grabbed a table, then each of us were able to go and seek out something we wanted to try. With average prices ranging from $4-$8, we were able to sample lots of different foods. Even though crowded, service was always quick. The slowest was the satay at the end, which took 10 mins! You are given a docket and told to come back at a certain time to collect it. The satay is 80 cents per stick, with a minimum order of 10 sticks. Food hygiene rating certificates are posted on each stall. Couldn't find anything less than an "A" rating.This place is touristy, but it's quick and cheap and allowed us to sample lots of different dishes. A little further over, upstairs, is the Chinatown Food Court with over 230 food stalls. This area is hot, incredibly crowded, with more food choices not geared towards tourists. Food is so much cheaper here, most dishes were around the $2-4 mark, however, hygiene certificates are mainly "B" and "C" in this area. We preferred the outdoor, touristy Smith Street
3
Always enjoy the street food at Singapore. Especially for the satay skewers. They are really really tasty. My kids can eat 20 of those each......me 2 ;) Enjoy the crowd and food here as places like this in Asia are getting less and less with the city development
5
Ate at Serangoon Raju Indian Cusine, stall 18. I was concerned that it would be too hot but the friendly attendant allowed me a taste beforehand. We had the prata chicken curry set. It was delicious! The curry was complex spicy but not too hot. The chicken pieces moist and tender. Well recommende
4
Located in the heart of Chinatown, this place is not only good for lunch or dinner but also to have a chit chat with friends, family, or even your love one in your origin country since the wifi quality is awesome. You can easily get video call using viber or line and the quality is really good
4
It is a mixture of food markets and restaurants with the unfortunate economic reality thrown in. There are many vacant and empty stores sprinkled around great restaurants and food stalls. The homeless abound decreasing the visual pleasure of Hawaii. The Public bus goes to this are and is only$2.50
4
Came here for dinner. Lots of choices between essentially hawker stands and sit down restaurants. Found a nice shaved ice place (Bingland) that had fine shaved ice similar to Taiwan, maybe a little sweeter.
4
Wonderfull experience. We test some indian, chinese and vegeterian food.
Great opportunity to taste several food, prices are low and you can eat on open space with great athmosfere.
4
Lot's of food but most importantly, there's free WiFi in this area! Can also hop by Maxwell Food Centre which is just across the street.
4
Lots of choices and a friendly, relaxed ambiance, you can get everything from a quick snack to a banquet here. Although restaurants are looking to entice you in they do not make you feel awkward or uncomfortable.
5
I love Singapore's hawker centres and street food markets, and this is possibly my favourite. Yes it's busy and yes it's touristy - but most of the fun here is about people watching. I was visiting Singapore just before Chinese new year when Chinatown was decorated with lanterns, streamers and plenty of goats, and the streets were buzzing with people. The food is varied, plentiful and cheap - the best thing is being able to try small portions of lots of dishes and all for only a few Singapore dollars. Some of the culinary highlights include Hainan chicken rice, chicken satay skewers, beef rendang and frog porridge - which when cooked in front of you adds a little bit of theatre to the mix too.
3
I shall skip the usual introduction to its history and others. The Chinatown Food Street Rojak is good starter before you begin to manifest your hunger for other dishes along the street. The Rojak's flavour mainly comes from its mix sauce (prawn paste, sugar) with mixed vegetables (cucumber, turnips), fruits (pineapple) and dough fritters. So what the deal with the source? its primarily a sticky black sauce (prawn paste) thats stirred together with all ingredients and lime juice before serving on a plate garnished with chopped peanuts and finely-cut fragrant ginger flowers for a mental stimulating taste. i am one who don't really like sweet food - this has captured my heart somehow.The general environment is rather thoughtful. There are a few large vents that pushes out cool air to its surrounding (somewhat like an air con) in the open to keep the tempreture low and comfortable even during sunny noon time. Yes, plenty of local food stalls for your selection and tasting. Admittedly, the mouth-watering local cuisines are reasonably priced.For tourist - there are many shop houses sell souvenirs and mementos that may capture your experience in chinatown. The onsite service level is also commendable. Tables are clean most of the time, the stalls servers are friendly and mostly bilingual. Not just tourists would visit the street food, you would see lots of locals during weekends as well.before i forget - Stall #11 is the Rojak stall I have been talking about. incidentally, theres this one S$10 karaoke just around the corner nearing the end of the food street. Do check it out if you want to sing your hearts out after a hearty meal with your loved ones
4
Hawker stalls side by side, limited tables, all types of fast food Chinese/Asian style. Suggest someone grab a table while others in your party order and bring food. So fun for tourists on a budget; also lots (!) of shopping nearby, less pricy than malls. Don't be in a hurry...crowds. Easy access , just off the MR
3
I personally prefer the Smith Street (Chinatown) Hawker Centre much more. But it has very few late night options. So this is an ok place to eat if you are shopping late. Nothing great but not bad either. Mainly catering to tourists. Try the durian chendol at the dessert stall.
1
I guess there might be good places along this street, but the place we ended up in was simply awful. We ordered a half duck and ask the waiter for tips on good sides to the duck. First he tried get us to order more meat, but we opted for some garlic veggies and rice. The waiter did not tell us that it was a traditional crispy duck meal, which already comes with sides of pancakes, veggies and hoisin.So with a lot of greens and rice on the table, the duck finally showed up after 20min. It was almost cold, and no part of it was remotely crispy. The cucumbers tasted like old water, and the hoisin was not eatable.Please do not go here, but rather go a few more meters to the food court, where you would find fantastic food to one third of the price
4
Food Street is one of those places I go to every trip to Singapore. There are many stalls in the middle as well as restaurants along the side, and all that I've had are pretty decent. It's also covered, so you don't have to worry about getting wet if it happens to be raining.The food stalls themselves don't sell drinks, so bring your own or go to the dedicated drink stalls at the end of the row of stands.My only complaint is that I feel bad for the people working the tray counter. On my last visit, an elderly man, who must have been at least 80 years old, motioned for me to give him my tray (it only had one empty plate, an empty bottle, and silverware), and as I did, I could see his arms trembling from the weight. But this is more a problem with Singapore, where it is common to see people well past the retirement age working.Other than that, it's definitely worth checking out Chinatown Food Street if you're in the area and want a quick bite
4
There are lots of Chinese street food in here. Want to try all some day. It's great place to have Chinese food in Singapore.
5
As usual, very basic and busy, but the traditional chinese roast duck was excellent, washed down with a cold beer. Weather reasonably muggy, however big fans do ease the heat.
4
Please do try the Fish Head curry and the Satay here, the beer helps , if you have had a nice shopping spree.
5
Awesome food cheap and served by staff who enjoy there jobs, always smiling, stayed a week and visited 3 times for dinner Roti and curry dipping sauce and Beef satay's with peanut sauce. washed down with a few Tiger beers.
the best
4
A very good selection of food
The street is very clean
Very busy in the evenings
Cost of food and drink Cheep $8 for a large bowl of prawn noodles $8 for a large Toger beer
Chilli crab is to be recomendad
5
Right in the heart of the action of Chinatown cheap eats but food to die for there are restaraunts down each side of the street and stalls down the middle plenty to choose from we used stall#7. And stall #9 chicken curry set from 1 stall and chicken satay from the other beautiful food and freshly prepared had to wait 10-15 minutes but well worth it the area was meticulously cleanWill DEFINATELY be coming here agai
3
Conveniently located amongst all the touristy shops trying to sell trinkets Step away to this street closed off for the purpose of enjoying Singapore hawker cuisine. Initially I thought the food may not be good but was pleasantly surprised! I had fried white turnips with soy sauce , hainanese chicken rice n iced dessert .. Yum yum yum
5
Wow what a place. This has got to be the best food we have had in a long time. Fresh ingredients, cooked In front of you and the taste is just a must. !!!!!!!! The crab stall is just amazing and could eat that every day. Crab in ginger and spring onion. Wow wow wow. !!!!!!!!
4
A great atmosphere with a wide variety of food to choose from. A clean, friendly environment. Chinatown food street is a middle ground: more upmarket and cleaner than the hawkers but not quite a restaurant. More an outdoor food court.We are here several times during our stay in Singapore and do not have a bad word to say about anything we are here
4
We visited Smith Street after visiting local Singapore attractions throughout the day. It was great to sit at one of the round outdoor tables and enjoy a cold beer before wandering along the street looking at the numerous choices of food. We shared the chicken satay sticks ($10) and then a plate of mixed dumplings etc ($10). The place had a great local atmosphere and didn't feel too touristy
4
Amazing aromas, good inexpensive food take time to walk round and choose what you want. Some stalls busier than others, this is where I would eat. Locals use this foe midday meal, so must be good
5
It's open until late. The option is endless. Great value. Not very easy to find but you will enjoy walking around the area because there are interesting stuff available to be bargain there.
5
Best fried oyster, bak kuh teh, char siu and roasted duck rice! Very convenient and accessible to Chinatown markets
4
This place was good enough for the prices! Had pepper beef with fried rice and liked it. A bit hot to eat near the food places, but if you go to the place where drinks are sold, there are many places to sit and eat.
4
Great atmosphere.nice to hang out with a friend or even alone with food predominantly from Asia. Chill in the outdoor seating areas bang in the middle of all the action. Go after 6.30 pm.
5
I liked rice with roasted duck and chicken. That was what I had everyday. I didn't had other kind of food because they all looked the same. There were some nice restaurants to sit inside with the a/c but the price was madness.
3
The food here is pretty average & varieties limited. Also it is quite expensive- by local hawker food prices standards. The ambience here is nice though. Many are not aware that on this same stretch of Smith Street, there is a very big hawker (food) centre on the 2nd floor of Chinatown Complex.Here you can find so much more varieties of good authentic local hawker food - & at much cheaper prices. This is really the place where the locals eat the 'good local' food at 'local' prices . It is quite common to see tourists here too; mostly on their own or those brought by tour guided.Of course this place does not have a nice ambience as Food Street but it is clean & cooling, being sheltered & with lots of fans. Worth a visit here if you love to try good local food at decent, cheap prices
4
This place is great for a cheap, tasty and freshly made meals whilst in Singapore. It's a covered street in the centre of Chinatown with vendors lined down the middle of the street. The satay is particularly good but be prepared to wait for the cooking of your meals.Drinks are provide at the tables by a funny and gregarious waitress
5
Went there many times, with friends, with family, at times alone. Best to go there early evening around 6 to 6.30 pm before the dinner crowds fill up the tables set up in the "open air", and before all the noise and din that drowns round-the-table conversation. In a group, we each order our local favourite dishes from different open-air cooking stations, either tell the cooks where we are sitting or stand to watch him/her cooking and collect our food fresh from the "wok". The stalls or stations are representing their various "main" restaurants located elsewhere in Singapore, thus they are known for their foods/menu they serve from. Local Singaporeans know which stall is famous for which kind of food. If you are not familiar, being a tourist or foreigner, spend a few minutes to observe how the locals order their food, or go ask the cook / stall owner and they are proud and happy to "fill-you-in". Sooo local, gooo local, watch what the locals eat ! Be brave, order from different stalls for starters, mains, desserts and Tiger Beer 
5
We ate at Tiong Bahru Meng Kee on food street,After reviews on TV we thought we would give it a try, they recommended buying from the one with the biggest line, glad we did, the food was amazing and such good prices, about $5 for pork ribs and noodles.Yum,yum,yum
5
Great food not over crowded like some of the food halls great variety of food cheap as well and plenty of seating
5
Its buzzing with all types of food and people. Sit down with your food and a lady will cone offer to get drinks . buildings around are out of this world
5
Fantastic array of choices and food. Very cheap and tasty. Pack with tourists. Very colourful and great experience
4
If you want to find great foods with affordable price, this is definitely a place to go. From Hainan Rice (they have bunch of choices of chicken.. !!) to Chili Crab, Congee to Indian Food.. you name it. Just make sure to choose wisely for moslem, because some of the food stalls serve pork, lard and all the stuff. Just steer clear from them and you can still choose chicken, seafood, and crab! ?I ordered pratha, chili crab, and some chicken.. and it was delish! in fact, i drool a little writing this. You can find any of singaporean food you want here. And what's amazing from this place is..they can keep it clean. No odor/bad smeel whatsoever, not even a stain in your table. This speaks so much about singapore itself. I love this place
4
Lots of shops and stalls selling a wide range of Singaporean hawker food. It get very crowded and getting a table can be difficult. Best to go with a couple of friends as you need to "grab" a table and others can order food. Lone travelers may struggle. Other options are the coffee shop style restaurants which offer tables and service.
5
Chinatown food street is a must visit at night! Options to keep everyone happy with reasonable prices. We have visited a couple of nights this trip and tried may different stalls, all taste fantastic but top picks would be the roti from serangoon raju Indian cuisine, the satay from Newtown circus ahmad ibrahim satay and the crab from Chinatown Crab Masters. Great atmosphere and great food!
4
Chinatown Food Street in Chinatown Singapore is a great culinary journey for the foodies ... from seafood to asian delicacies and even ribs, all can be found down this food street as so aptly named.Some Tips:1. Do not dine here at noon time - the weather in singapore is hot and humid and can get uncomfortable.2. On your first trip, take a leisurely walk across the street scanning every food stall and then zero in coz price and variety changes from stall to stall
4
We had lunch here a few times, the food choice is good, priced from a few dollars to nearly $100 for chilli crab (you'd find better deals at better places for crab if you search). Hot days can be uncomfortable as its open air but this adds to the atmosphere, take a packet of wet ones with you
4
There are so much variety and from so many different stalls and shops to choose from that it's starting to be mind boggling.It's however mainly a variety of Singaporean Chinese food but it's delicious all the same.Main streets of Chinatown is just next door so this is another 'street' of food glorious food in Singapore but with shopping therapy
5
An old street which has kept it's character in the heart of china town, modernised by a partial glass roof which you don't even realise is there. You sit in what can only be described as a giant outdoor restaurant full of street food vendors surrounded by the china town market on the other streets, there is a real sense of enjoyment and vibrancy. When you look up you are reminded you are in an amazing city by the spectacular sky scrappers constructed on the outskirts of china town
5
Just a brilliant place to visit. The hustle and bustle of the market, but it is so clean. A great range of foods - Chinese, Indian, Malay - plus ever attentive drinks sellers make sure you never go thirsty. A great experience.
3
A lot of shops of traditional Singapore food here. Price and quality are acceptable. Taste is OK, not so spicy as Thai food.
4
If you are looking for the good old hawker food days then this is a good spot. Plenty of choices between the stall vendors and terrific food. You can get plates of small, medium and large for $10. $20 and $30. The best thing is the Tiger Beers 600ml from the street vendors are only around $8 each. And thats really cheap for Singapore. Food is great and the area is very clean. Recommend the visit and also to Newtons Circus
2
We love Singapore street food, have been coming to Singapore for close to 40 years. But we will never eat in Smith street again! We arrived relatively early, by underground train, and it was already busy with tour groups, and the usual leader with a flag! We really wanted to eat some great noodles and satay, ordered both, and of course their local beer! Beer was good, food was terrible! There are many vendors to choose from but if you want better street food, go to Satay by the Bay, in the Gardens by the Bay
4
We went here for a couple of lunchtimes, good roast duck and rice $5 bargin!! Lovely spring rolls, choose a seat and purchase food from any of the vendors, undercover can be warm but lots of cold tiger beer, in Central Chinatown lots to see nearby. Staff not particularly friendl
4
I had read that food on this street could be overpriced, however my sister and I found what we had to be very good value.We ordered from a stall in the middle of the street, however I unfortunately cannot remember its name. We ordered Lemon Chicken and Rice (S$5.00), BBQ Chicken and Rice (S$4.50), a Long Neck Tiger Beer and Iced Peach Tea (S$10.50 for the two).The food was excellent and I really enjoyed the Iced Peach Tea
5
A fun place to eat, with a good assortment of foods. Although it's made to be a street fair of assorted foods, which it does feel this way, the prices are higher than what you would pay at a traditional Singapore Hawker Centre.If it rains, much of the street is undercover, so it's a good place to eat all year round.Also being part of China Town, I find it one of the best place to eat there
5
Great busy place to eat with an array of choices, satay, seafood, soups, noodles, you name it it's here and cheap too.There are wonderful ladies that deliver beer to you , only got to nod and they are on it. Entertaining place and open late, a must when visiting Singapore
4
So many choices and extremely well priced, average $4 - $6 per meal. Plenty of stalls, sometimes language barrier might arise but you can usually get your message across as most meals have photos to identify. So easy to eat on the go without scouting for a flash restaurant
5
If you love trying different foods this is the place to go! I liked the open atmosphere a lot and I felt freer than in like and indoors hawker centre.Foods that stuck out to me: satays, hainanese chicken rice, and the paratha stuffed with mutton.Also, none of the places would open until exactly 11am. Which was annoying because all their stuff was prepared! I guess I understand their attention to regulation (and how other hawker centres are like that too) but just be prepared to be hungry until 11. There are some places that serve earlier but they have less savory, in my opinion, options
4
All the stalls in the middle of the street are really great prices and lovely flavours. Went there 3 x during are stay and would def go there again
5
nice place for dinning at night, and food have more choices, all food are from oldies, all foods cannot find from outside, only in chinatown food street.
5
Ate here twice in our 4 day trip to Singapore. So much to choose from, authentic and delicious Chinese food. Very affordable.
4
The experience of having street food/ Hawker center food in Singapore is one not to be missed. This is located just around the corner from the more popular Maxwell street, but equally good. We went their by default, as everyone was too hungry to walk the extra 100 yards.It was interesting to see the proper restaurants empty, while the street tables were full. At both ends are the beverage and desert van, from where we got our beer and drinks. Each stall had a different kind of food, so by getting each dish fro a different stall, we actually ate quite a variety of Singaporian food, and a lot of different flavours. Like the whole city, this street was also remarkably clean ( unlike many food streets all over the world).The quality of food was also as good as that at any other restuarant. Definitely a must. next time will visit the other food street
4
Good atmosphere for hang out and you can choose the food you want. Quality of the food is good. However the price is slightly costly for foodcourt type of food. The place is clean and organised. However it is a bit stuffy as no wind at the time we had dinner there. Overall is a recommeded place to try

Located at Smith St, there are various food stalls located here. A good start for any tourists looking to have an understanding of Singapore's food culture. Do take note that other food from other stalls (those along the shophouses) are NOT allowed. Ample seating and near to souvenir shopping
4
My partner had wanted to visit Chinatown at night and go to the food market for dinner,so after a bit of souvenir shopping we tried to decide what to have, there is a good variety of food available and the stalls seem very hygienic and organized.After making our choices we had to find seating, the seating around the stalls were full and we thought they belonged to the little restaurants around the food court.We found a table in front of a restaurant, the hawkers were all calling out to get business into their restaurants so it wasn't a quiet meal, but you felt you were in a market place and it added to the atmosphere
4
We went to Chinatown but did not sandfly eat in the street stalls which are for tourist. We went to the local food court on the second floor and got feed like kings for a fraction of the price. The roast duck and pork were sensational, we also had mango d pudding with shaved ice tummy. My advice is to skip the food street and go to the food cour
4
I ran into this walking around Chinatown looking for a place to eat. It is a little sterile but a great place for a first timer to see how a street market operates. You order drinks from one booth and you walk around to see what specialty dishes each booth sells. I recommend walking by them to all to see what they have. It is a great place with friends as you can order different items and share as a group. I was looking for duck but no one had any. Arrive early as I discovered they do run out of items now and then. Place is pretty clean as there are people cleaning tablets constantly. A definitely stop if your in the Chinatown area
4
When in Singapore recently we went to the Sate Club. There are many outlets seving sate everything, (beef, pork, chicken, seafood), steamed buns and beer. During the day it is a road and at night it becomes a food market. The tables are a bit rickety which adds to the adventure. Its smokey from the sate burners which keeps the mossies away. There are no paper napkins avaiable so there are hawkers selling small packet of tissues at highly inflated prices.
5
Ate Jurian the fruit yes it smells block your nose and try it it's delishious sampled so many small meals while shopping awesome time
4
After walking around Chinatown and looking at all the eateries we finally chose Hunan. Staff were very friendly and helpful. Beer was cold and the food was delicious. Great selection, good size portions and just good around atmosphere.
4
I visited the Chinatown hawker market at 1pm. Had Satay, claypot rice and curry chicken. Delicious Food cheap and had a fun time. The only issue is that this place is hot and there were hordes of people there.
5
The market area and the food street were still buzzing at 7.30 at night. Lots of people about and the vendors were not at all pushy, they accepted no "with a smile".
4
This is a very neat clean street designed to showcase a large variety of dishes. You can watch your food being prepared. There are plenty of table on which to sit. Every food rating that I saw was an
1
Bbq sting ray was cold and hard, evidence it had been cooked and left there for a while.
Oyster omelette (orh luak) was too salty and oily.
You are just a stone's throw away from good food if you know where to go.
4
I ate here two nights. The first was ok, Thai fish cakes and fried rice. But the second night, chicken murtabak. It was brilliant!! I would go again just for that. If that's not your thing, the Satays looked fantastic too. Worth a visit when in Singapore. Good cheap food with atmosphere.

Rather than a dedicated hawkers centre, Smith Street ‚Äì also known as Food Street - is a street in Chinatown with stalls down the centre of the road. At one time it was like other small streets in Chinatown road although mainly lined with restaurants rather than shops, but now it is pedestrianised with hawker‚Äôs stalls down the centre and a covered roof along most of the length to protect it from rain. The restaurants are still there, of course, with touts outside waving their menus, but they must be feeling the pinch with the arrival of the stalls as most people seem more interested in what the stalls have to offer rather than the restaurants.Some stalls have a few tables restricted for their customers, but there is plenty of general seating that can be used by anyone with food from any stalls (particularly a large area at the South Bridge Road end where you can eat or simply order a large bottle of cold Tiger beer from the end stall). But be careful not to sit at a table belonging to one of the restaurants to eat your food from a stall ‚Äì they don‚Äôt like it!Like all hawkers markets/centres, the food will vary depending on the stall and what you order. Although we did have some very good meals, I felt that overall it was not as good as some other hawker centres, which may account for the fact that there seemed far fewer locals than tourists eating (you even get the occasional tour group following a guide holding a flag). However, like other hawkers stalls, it is all very cheap ‚Äì and the benefit of this place is that it is so centrally situated in Chinatown. A word of warning ‚Äì twice I was given short change. Maybe a genuine mistake, but you never know, so count your change to be on the safe side
4
The food street (Smith Street I believe is the official street name) is an excellent choice for visitors. All of Singapore's food is represented here, stalls in the middle of the street as well as restaurants lining the sides. Great place to get the hawker center experience without the hawker center feel. Stuffed ourselves silly. The area around is also nice to explore. Also a great place for craft beers a couple of streets away (Mosque Street I think..). Will definitely go back.
1
Ordered the BBQ stingray and it was served to me almost instantly. It seem to have been cooked way in advance. The dish was awful - Cold, tough and tasteless. Not worth the sgd12.The fried oyster was served almost the same way but it was more tasty than the stingray.Tip: head down to chinatown market food centre 5 mins away for much better food
3
Only ate here once during our two week holiday and it was part of a tour. We had to Roti Prata it's was very good but I think the roti Prata we got in little India was better.
4
Various kinds of good food. Reasonable price. Cozy outdoor atmosphere. I ordered a roasted duck rice for $4.
4
We ordered several dishes that the internet suggested to try during a visit in singapore. I tried fried oyster, hainanese chicken, carrot cake, chicken wings, kacang, kaya toast, watermelon juice, and so much more!
4
Plenty of variety, cheap food $5-10. Tables and chairs available. Open late. the markets are just around the corner.
1
The moment we sat down. A fierce PRC chinese woman push our table further away from their restaurant, further away from the shophouse. Even challenging you to complain to the managemen, which I did return with one. But she just act innocent of her barbaric acts. I had the impression the food here should be better than hawjer centre standard. Ordered a Indian mutton soup(kamping soup) soup was not the standard thichksoupk soup but clear , watery and the mutton given was a chunks of fats... 1/10Next is deep fried fritters with bee hoon. Turn out e vermilion aka bee hoon taste sticky ( sign of fermentation or place hours before selling).. .. 2/10Sambal chilli with Stingray fish and vegetables turns out to be the only food we had that matches normal hawker centre food.. .
5
You can see by the Chinese & Singaporean clientele that this is a good place to eat. The small outdoor cafes are usually packed and people are waiting for seats to come free. Portions are big so don't order too much - although it's hard not to. I came back here night after night. Best places for me were the outside places just along from where you come into the square at the back of the MRT station. Pictures on wall help to chose
5
This is certainly the place to go if you're looking to try various street food and restaurants from several different countries. We stumbled upon these winding alleys of food paradise upon hopping off of the bus to visit the Buddah Tooth Relic Temple. We tried various Indian and Singaporean dishes and they were all great and very pocket friendly. Would definitely love to stop here again
3
As a local, i do not find the food great, a lot of msg to be honest. But i strongly encourage you to try the food in the restaurants especially from china, they are authentic and tastes good. heck to the msg. also, the ambience is nice, especially late evening on a non rainy day. it is also crime safe, you wont get pick pocketed (fingers crossed) or walk into a shocking smelly place. If you go in the morning, you can see lots of old people sitting around, nice sight from old Singapore days. Be sensitive if you take photos cos some are quite aggresive and may be verbal. You may come across a few rude ones, more like they are mentally unstable but not aggressive, so laugh it off
3
I give thumbs up for certain food.For instance the Fried Prawn Hokkien Mee and the Fried White Carrot Cake.However, in terms of service, is totally worse.You can be standing in front of the stall and the hawker just totally act you are not there.Super rude
4
I'm enjoying my dinner here. So many delicious food to try, and also their kinds of dessert. The atmosphere here is great for taking your family. You can choose your own kind of food you like to eat. When I'm back to Singapore, I'm coming back here for sur
5
You guys must visit this area, there are many things you can explore here, foods, souveniers ...amazing
4
Food Street is dirt cheap. S$ 8 for a full meal
Eateries on Pagoda are a bit more expensive but still good value for money
5
You can find any food here... There's a lot of choice.. if you love food's street.. this is gonna be your favorite places..
5
I've hardly had better food in my life and I write about food for a living. I used KF Seetoh's makansutra to find my way around but it was last updated in 2013 and things do change.
5
We really enjoyed our day in and around the Chinatown Food Street area. Everyone was friendly. There was lots of free food to try and food was inexpensive (for Singapore).
If you are in Singapore you must visit!
1
The stall holders are very unfriendly and attitude. Compare to hawker centre, the food here is more pricey and doesn't taste good. This place is very warm and there no fan. Simply would not come here again.
3
But they are plenty of varieties to choose from. But it is expensive.
Too crowded and people are moving very slowly.
3
I have eaten here twice and the second time was with my wife during chinese new year. Of all the hawker centres this is easily the most disappointing. We had black carrot, dumplings. The dumplings were ok but in general I have found the food more gluggy. Go to newton or glutton bay market instea
4
Among all the tourist-centric food centres, chinatown food street is the best. It has a good variety of local delights, quality Singaporean food in an al fresco environment for a hearty gathering with friends or to fill an empty stomach. My personal favorites which I would recommend to all including our Dear overseas visitors are: stir-Fry prawn noodles, satays (skewers of meat including chicken, beef and mutton), murtabak (Indian pancake dish with fillings which may include chicken, mutton, and many other selections) and BBQ chicken wings. My German friend loves the laksa and actually finished the last drop of gravy in the bowl recently. So, go try the food there if you haven't! It is opened till late every day
4
The whole street seems to be a long food court. There are different stalls in the middle and at the sides. Food being offered varies from Chinese to Singaporean to Indian influenced cuisine. It is an open space area and tables are available everywhere. Prices are a bit overpriced
5
It is pretty busy as they are preparing for Chinese New Year but it is well worth it.
The food is great and tasty and not too expensive either.
Definitely a must while visiting Singapore.
4
Though very much a hawker centre for tourists, this is still a great place to eat with a genuine variety of excellent dishes. It's so nice to be able to get Indian, Malay and Chinese food in one location.
4
There are many shops that offer variety of food. We share the seat at the table with other two lady. It is a crowded place with noisy and fume but you will enjoy eating there.
5
There were many shops and restaurants here of a variety of quality and price. There are also museums and other tourist attractions in the area. I felt very safe in the area. Very clean and well maintained.
1
Just go to the Maxwell St Hawker Centre. Even though all the vendors at the Food Street are rated A, I got a sore tummy afterwards despite not having any problems with the B rated vendors at Maxwell.
5
A lovely place full of hustle and bustle. Comes alive at night. Lots of street food stalls with a huge range of very tasty dishes to choose from. You can be pestered frequently to buy drinks
4
There were so many different types of foods to try, everything was delicious! We sampled dishes from many different stalls, sharing everything so we could get as much variety as possible. My advice is to do a lap first and check out what you'd like to try, then find a table, be prepared to grab a seat with a stranger, then leave your partner at the table whilst you go off and order! Some of the stalls the cook brings the food to your table, other stalls you carry it yourself. It is busy, loud, a bit smelly, but the food looks and smells amazing! And was so tasty! Oh yeah, the place is still open and going strong at midnight! We had char Siew pork, chicken rice, popiahs, Peking duck, roti chani, something on a stick and I had some interesting icy dessert with red bean and jelly underneath the ice and a drizzle of creamed sweet corn on top!? It might be a little more expensive than the Chinatown complex nearby, but it is still very cheap. Be brave and try everything
5
Chinatown Food Street is a great place to sample some of Singapore‚Äôs iconic dishes in the one convenient location. It‚Äôs very clean, having been recently revamped, and now has not only a high glass canopy to protect diners from the elements but also a cooling system to help dampen down some of Singapore‚Äôs heat and humidity. Located on Smith Street in the middle of Chinatown, it is open from 11am to 11pm and is also a pedestrian only zone.Some of the dishes available include the famous Geylang fresh frog leg porridge, hokkien mee, satay, fried oysters, chicken rice, and roast pork and duck. The food is fresh, tasty and very reasonably priced, with plenty of options to keep everyone happy. A great option if you‚Äôre short on time in Singapore and want to sample a range of dishes
5
The food street smells chinese food all along, but the centre of this street is one shop selling Indian food with veg options too. I had parathas with dal (compliment) which were excellent and went back thrice to have the same, while my wife tried other veg options(biriyani, rice, roti etc). Never missed indian food being in this part of the city :
4
We enjoyed our evening eating at Food Street, Chinatown. There were many varied selections of food outlets from which to choose according to taste and preference. Reasonable prices and ladies offering drinks. It was great to sit and eat, and watch the people passing by. Not sure how it would go if raining, most is covered by a new roof
4
I had for the first time frog legs and they were really good. They are prepared in a clay pot with a marinade of choice.
We also had chicken sate which was not so good. This is my mistake for ordering sate in Chinatown.
4
After eating at the Chinatown Food Street, we walked towards New Bridge Road direction and chanced upon this small dessert shop at 68 Smith Street called Kwai Fa Lam Dessert. Excellent Hong Kong style dessert and shaved ice they served. Great service too!
5
Amazing. Fab selection, great atmosphere. As a solo traveller, it was a nice place to people watch and not be alone without the stress of eating in a restaurant. I LOVED the hygiene awards - little signs awarded to shops with excellent food cleanliness, and the wide selection of food. I ate there three times and wished I had ordered more each time. I would highly recommend the prata from the last stall closest to the main road
5
This place is great if you want some tasty cheap easy asian food to try. We visited twice in our week visit to Singapore as we were very impressed. Its a very well run place with people cleaning tables very quickly and keeping people moving in the Q for food. You choose what food you want from various carts, place your order and its ready made fresh infant of you. Everything we had was very tasty and filling.We would return again if we are in Singapore in the future
5
Located in the downtown of Singapore. Chinatown Street Food is the most famous street food in Singapore. You can find so many Chinese Food there. Fried oyster, fried rice, satay (skewered and grilled meat, with special sauce) and fried rice-cake (char kway teow) are recommended.What to bring? Money, cameraIt costs 4SGD - 7SGD for each portionYou can reach the Chinatown by:MRT (Chinatown MRT Station)Bus (Take the bus to New Bridge Rd., People's Park Complex, Eu Tong Sen St.
4
Walk down this street and you are greeted by food carts and restaurants of all shapes and sizes. There is a wide range of cuisine to choose from and it does not pinch your pocket much. Gets busy, adds to the ambience. Tasty fresh food servied in an open ambience

Out of curiousity, I ventured into Smith Street in China Town in Singapore one day after Christmas. It was about 11.30 am and the place was empty. I walked up and down that section where are the hawker food was and unbelievably, couldn't find anything that attracted me. Apart from the roast meat store, they were all touristy looking. As it was oppressively hot to be sitting in the open street area (albeit with a transparent roof covering), I ducked into a coffee shop type of eatery. I ordered a noddle set meal which came with a small plate of vegetables and some wanton in a soup. The main noodle was plain and bland and had nothing except some small minced pork pieces. I think I paid around S$8 for the set. Most disappointing after all the hype I read about
2
We tried one of these stands for food when visiting Chinatown and I think we were rather unlucky with the choice we made since they food was not edible at all, only the rice. The price, though, was very cheap and you get to eat like the locals which is a fun and different experience being European and not seeing this in Europe. We will try another one should we ever come back
1
The atmosphere was nice, surrounded with other tourist. It has few more options than a single shop. But the food was totally crap and overpriced. Even the beer was more expensive than the shop just beside it. But the problem here is you can have drink or food from shops around it. Better to find a restaurant with outside table. Then order food and drink from that restaurant
5
We stayed in a nearby hotel for this visit to Singapore and chose a different place to eat for every meal. It was Chinese New Year so their were large crowds after about 10am. Nothing nicer than scouring menus or smelling the divine aromas and choosing somewhere else to eat. We were there for 10 days and although we have two favourite places,..... There are still so many places to eat on our next visit
4
Lot of varieties for authentic and modern Chinese food could be found in Chinatown which included traditional snacks, rice & noodles, full & half course meals, dim-sum, desserts, and local fruits.
4
We enjoyed meals in small shops. The food street is very nice and even though sometimes we do not know what we were going Verily room, it allowed us to discover dishes
5
the food on these streets are excellent and very cheap.
good value for money.
don't have to bother with restaurants in Singapore.
2
I feel quite disappointed because the food is quite expensive as the food taste no different from other chinatown hawker centre. I rather pay less to eat at other hawker centre or pay more to eat at an air-cond restaurant.
3
Good for the experience but average in terms of price, waiting time and variety of food. The overall ambiance is good but finding a seat can be a challenge here.
4
It was certainly very hot in Singapore and you really didn't feel like eating in the heat but when you're hungry, you're hungry....There are a lot to choose from in this Food Street but I chose stir fried morning glory and stir fried black pepper beef and it was really good. My husband found his favourite, duck, next door to my food outlet and we sat at a table near some big fans and didn't feel too bad. A bottle of water and off you go....Quick and tasty foo
5
You name it's at Chinatown food stalls, including chicken feet and snails..don't be put off..loads of traditional food Chinese, Japanese, Thai. It took me 20 mins to decide on one our 4 visits. Average price 3/4sng. Drinks from cane sugar, all manner of tea flavours, along with beer. Right down to coke. Very clean and very busy. Plenty of seating.. If you watch the locals line up at a stall. It's very good. One stall had at least 20 locals happily waiting... Take away is not a problem. One area of Chinatown has people coming to your table asking if you want a drink. But one food item is missing no burgers...for those expecting burgers...the food stalls are on the first level, up stairs or elevator. Chinatown has lots of alley ways so take a look.. Watch out for the big "Gold Buddha" and give his tummy a rub for luck. Lots of little signage that are on pillars that give the stories of what Chinatown was like 50 years ago, very interesting. Thank you for reading my review. I hope you have loads of fun
5
Definitely one of my favorite places to eat in Singapore. Lots of food stalls with a good variety of high-quality food, all for very cheap prices. Nicely lit up at night so it really is quite pretty. There are also restaurants along the same street, but with all the food stalls I can't see why you would bother with them
4
A variety of stalls and small restaurants to take your pick from. We stopped for a quick lunch and had a nice beef dish and a couple of beers. I'd love to try some of the more authentic looking places but always get put off by the offer of something looking a lot less desirable than what I ate here
5
A great place to .eat It has been cleaned up since my last visit and is now set out easy on the street to see what to eat and how it is cooked. There are also lots of great restaurants with lots of choices. A must visit for reasonable good choices of many kinds of foods
4
Visited it at night. Eventhough it is quite crowded, but the atmosphere really great and vibrant. Tried eat char sew rice, and it was really delicious. Good place to hang out with friends at night
3
good place to get loads of food in one place... the best of singapore, or the touristy facsimiles of it... loved the fried oysters.
3
This place serves the tourists well as it gives a good sampling of our local food.The food is obviously overpriced compared to the hawker centre a stone's throw away.I had a light snack of a $2.50 pohpiah which is grossly overpriced. It has only vegetables and almost tasteless.The minced garlic was missing. To make it worst, the hawker collected money from me and with the same hand continued to hold on to the pohpiah as he sliced it. I stopped him but he didn't seem to feel sorry for what he did
3
The food street in Chinatown is mainly under cover with a glass roof. It reminded me of a shopping mall. The food we ate was just ok and offered neither value nor taste. I was shocked at the rather small portions offered. We bought a bottle of cola and asked for an extra cup with ice they had the cheek to charge us for it!!!It's an experience walking through and our food was bought from the food stalls in the middle. I would imagine that the restaurants running down either side offered better food. Lesson learnt. On our 40 day Far East experience eating here was the only place that gave us severe upset stomachs and we ate in lots of street markets!!!
4
Great athmosphere at night, like old harbour town.. I love the satay, bought the BaKuTeh, bought the sugarcane juice, bought Carrot Cake! Love the oyster eggs, and HOKKIEN PRAWN MEE is great! My Dad and Mom liked it! Not as cheap as other food courts, but value for money is okay..
1
Chinatown has lost it authentic good food and it doesn't value for the money spend in the food. At least the roasted duck stall still taste nice and the staff are polite. The environment is good but it seem hot when in the hot sunny day , it'll be good if they could install nos of fans
2
Visited Smith Street last year and loved it. Returned last week and what has happened? Now very sanitised, all the stalls look the same and prices have gone up. Meal was very average - duck, chicken and pork combo was cold and a very small serving on a tiny plate. Seems to cater more for the tourist. The place was only half full, not like I remember in March last year when we had trouble finding a seat. We really enjoy Chinatown, but will be looking for new places to eat
4
Chinatown Food Street has a nice selection of local "hawker stalls". Currently, there is a promotion (with reduced prices) of the popular favourites. We found the food very good, but not outstanding. Many tourists visiting Chinatown make a stop here to sample local dishes at a modest price
3
If you're a local with a ton of hawker options and know where to go specifically for certain dishes, you'll find that all the dishes here, despite its famous associations don't quite hit the mark. I've tried the Odean beef noodles here, the hokkien mee, wanton mee, bak chor mee, etc. all pretty sub-par. But I get to eat hawker foods throughout the week so perhaps I've become a bit of a discerning consumer of hawker fare. However, if you're looking for a one-stop spot / sheer convenience of sampling a variety of hawker fare, then this isn't a bad spot. Besides, its location in the heart of Chinatown makes it easy to go sightseeing right after you heart your heart out here
3
We were very disappointed. probably our own fault in not taking time to look and see what was offering. If I did it again, which I wont, I would have a bit of something from the stalls that looked good, not a full meal from one. We had the half BBQ duck. Flavour was lacking, it was barely warm and the accompaniaments not to my liking. Overpriced for what I was
5
I loved the variety of hawkers and the food they serve. A must not miss is the black pepper beef that is so yummy and tasty!
5
Since our hotel is closed by the foodcourt, I visited so many time.
I tried Katong oyster omelette, satay bee hon, bak kut teh, black pepper crab. Overall it's tasty and cheap.
5
I have eaten here several times. So far, I've had the kwetiau, fried oyster omelette, and frog legs. I highly recommend the frog.
4
Resonable Price and many kind of food, clean. Easy to access from MRT. Open from Morning to night time. Not only hawker but also small restaurants around.
5
The choice of food is great. Price of food is very reasonable. Very interesting mix of peoples eating out.
4
Cheap, tasty food with lots of different choices and experiences! The street is undercover so even when raining you can still enjoy your meal.
4
Walked down Smith street and had to keep in mind there were more shops further down the street before deciding. Came across a nice place that had a great choice of dumplings - girlfriend being a huge fan of dumplings this is where we ate!
5
Oyster and tiger beer, now great place with roof. Eating many special here . I prefer Oyster in the middle of street ... 8s$ for the best baby oyster i get here. Beer 8.5s$
4
We ate here numerous times for lunch and dinner. Lunch deals are excellent value, great food including a lush, refreshing iced peach tea. I don't eat duck usually, but I did try it here and it was delicious! Just dip into any of the stalls and find a spare table. Nice and shaded in the day with the roof covering the entire street and a good spot in the evening, during which it gets super busy
4
I'm not sure what to make of the canopy. I know it's caused the restaurants to raise their prices and that might have explained the lack of people there at lunch time. It was strangely deserted for a week day. The food I had was excellent and I wanted more That's always a good sign for me. Will visit next time
5
I had the chicken rice and fried oysters, and snacked on chestnut pancakes and these sort of prawn omelets.
5
Pro: A lot of various food and fresh seafood, mostly Chinese. Very nice fruit juices
Con: It's street food. Be prepared for plastic dishes.
5
Get those dimsums! It's a very good place to enjoy with friends, loads of chinese and other asian cuisine.
4
Some places you may not want to try but others the food is fresh and great. Not just Chinese but Thai and other foods also around.
4
When in Singapore do as the Singaporeans do and that is partake in the streetfood whether it be in Chinatown or Little India you will find great little coffee shops with chilli crabs and many other delights
3
It is newly done up street hawker stalls, shophouse restaurants and ad hoc street kiosks, complete with the al-fresco dining style along the street, one can revisit the Chinatown of old at CFS. Newly constructed high-ceiling glass canopy shelter and internal spot cooling system allow diners to indulge in culinary pleasures regardless of rain or shine. Now fully pedestrianized, visitors can dine in comfort along Smith Street from day to night.Good place to have authentic Singapore Food.
4
This is actually an alley where you get lots of street food cantines one next to the other.Each one has its own delicacies and every member of your company can choose from a different cantine.You can sit in one of the tables that are common for all the cantines and enjoy really tasty and cheap street food. Cockroaches are common sight -just ignore them
4
A quick and cheap (compared to the average Singapore restaurant) way to eat good food in a nicely chaotic environment. Tables and street food stalls are set in a nice tipical chinatown street. Although it's in an open air place it's quite comfortable because it's partially air conditioned.They mostly serve local food. The average price for a one course dinner is 8 sg. dollars (beverage included)
2
I visited Chinatown Food Street after walking pass it several times after the renovation. There are a lot of stores and variety to choose from. Majority of the food are local food that I used to eat when I was a child. So since it's "brand new" now I decided to bring my family for lunch on a Sunday.First thing that shocked me was the price. It is higher than the typical air condition food courts like Kopi Tiam. OK.. so it's new right and the rent must have gone up. I let this slide... We ordered a variety of food and it doesn't taste good. Not that it's bad but it has lost it's original character.I grew up in Singapore and therefore I can compare the food to what it should've been. I won't mind paying a bit more to enjoy the comfort of the environment or the good taste of the food. But to pay more and do not get to taste the authenticity of the food, this I cannot accept.I suppose for tourists who have not tasted the authentic local food then they won't know the difference. For me I'd rather take another minute to walk to the Chinatown hawker centre on the second floor of the market
3
Very expensive if compared to genuine 'Singaporean' hawker centres. This place has had a face lift to capture tourist trade and with that goes tourist prices and lots of tourists! It took us almost 30 minutes to get a table. The chicken biryani was nothing special ....you will get better in Little India
4
We like the new shelter added to the street, shading us from the hot sun and the sudden rain showers. The stalls were neatly located. The whole street has a new vibrancy.
5
Amazing foods at every turn for some of the cheapest prices I paid in Singapore. You really will want to return to this wonderful venue. Get one of your group to claim a table while others place orders.....a great fun night.
4
Many food stall to choose. Price is average. It's difficult to find seat during rush hour, especially if you're a solo traveller.
5
Good food good taste and also I love these food street organized. It has free wifi, and a lot of local taste with fair price.
3
The food we ate there was good but expensive. There were no prices written nor they gave us a menu.Crowded and not very clean. Table were dirty and we had to clean it ourselves.A fresh juice vendor annoyed us to order, then we had to pay one more juice which we returned because we hadn`t ordered it.Disappointing experiens
4
Food's cheap and there's a lot to choose from. From chicken rice to chilly crab to noodle soups. Whew! The place is a bit hot though but its worth it. Or you can choose the ones with airconditioning. Don't ask for tissue/napkin, there's none. You can either bring your own or buy. Not all stalls have friendly staff.

Located in the center of the Chinatown 'junk market' areas, and adjacent to the Chinatown Heritage Center, this hawker center contains a large variety of dishes from all kinds of Asian cultures. Chinese, Singaporean, Indian, you name it. There's even a few shops as part of the Chinatown market, even a few guesthouses for those seeking local accomadation. Similar to other local food stall areas or centers, everything is spread out individually based on the dish/cuisine served. All the dishes are relatively low-priced, and you can easily grab a cheap lunch or supper here. Seating can become quite limited, especially during the weekends or crowd hours, but its all scattered about the entire area for any no. of people. I highly recommend the Fishball Noodle stalls and the dessert stall, where they happen to serve great Ais Kachang

The food street was bustling and loud everything you want in this sort of location, loads of atmosphere. There was a wide choice and the food was delicious. Our kids (4 and 1) loved it, because they went to each stall to choose there food. It was also really cheap
2
Its a one stop hawker food place where tourist can find quite a fair range of local speciality. I would have expected more varieties of food. However, I believe due to the space constrain, this is not possible.In general, food are ok but a little pricey comparing to those you find at the actual local hawker stall thus I conclude that this is a place good for tourist to experience the local food. The set up is too commercialized that does not give you the actual feel of what the past street hawker used to be. Perhaps we can learn from those in Kuala Lumpur or Malacca, which the old charm and authenticity remains
4
We dined twice at this lively street setting with our kids and enjoyed the experience. An abundance of hawker food variety for you to choose from at reasonable prices that will satisfy all tastes. Malay, Chinese, Indo and Indian are well represented and you can opt for smaller dish sizes so you can sample more than one. Don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t forget to start with a serve of legendary satays.Thanks for the vote if you found this helpful. Happy travels

Experience hawker food in better environment without the fear of a downpour or hot weather (although the air con is not too low, you can still feel the heat but in a much better state)
1
lousy and expensive food & drinks, terrible service, "Char Kway Tiao' was my favorite food for 30 years and I could not even take 2nd bite....
4
Loved the food and the variety, Loved the location and loved the people watching atmosphere. Total must do
4
What a great street, so many choices of food to try, so hard to pick. Had the laksa here, it was amazing really tasty. Lovely street to have a bite to eat.
4
they got free wifi all around china town.
they served good meals with affordable price. not to mention good ambience and nice surrounding, great for photo.
4
The food was delicious and made in a traditional way. However, the original bustling street full of hawkers trying to sell you their wares are gone and have been replaced with clean, tidy and very practical chairs and tables surrounding permanent stalls with easy to read menus. If you like the mystery of trying random street food, unfortunately this won't happen, but you will get a delicious meal with beer served by the beer ladies and be safe in the knowledge that all has passed Singapore's strict food safety laws.
4
This is the place to go to if you want to try specialty dishes from the main Chinese dialects and the different races in Singapore. The newly constructed high-ceiling glass canopy shelter and internal spot cooling system allow diners to indulge in culinary pleasures regardless of rain or shine. The food street is fully pedestrianized and has plenty of seating for small to large groups. Free wifi available in the area. Food is slightly more pricey compared to the other food centres but still reasonable
4
recently renovated, food street now boasts more eateries - and the quality of the food is generally on par with any of the best hawker centes in singpaore. Thankfully it has not gone the way of newton Circus which is a rip off for unsuspectin tourists .. food street is well populated by locals and visitors alike. Difficult to single our any particular stall as it all depends on your taste.. get there early at weekend as the tables fill up quickly
3
We were all very excited with the newly revamped food street. Yes, it is definitely more organized and there is food variety aplenty! I tried the famous High Street Tai Wah Pork Noodles. Portion is small but taste is ok but I still feel the original noodles previously served at Bestway Building was more genuine and taste better. Well, for proximity and convenience, I had to make do with the substitute and complain less
4
Food Street in China Town is a great place to bring my friends to. Regularly I bring there between 2-20 friends who come and visit Singapore. It has a great selection of dishes from a variety of cultural and culinary backgrounds. In the evenings the atmosphere is relaxed, laid back and we usually enjoy watching those walking bye and of course the tasty food and laughter. The food stalls√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ personal is generally friendly and helpful and it is fun having some small talks with the seniors who are cleaning the tables. From here it is easy to get to the MRT station or a taxi stand

Covered street with lost of little stalls, great food, ( fresh tasty good value) good atmosphere , lots of locals on a weeknight

Unlike many Chinatown in other country, this one is rather clean and the usual "fragrance" of food and atmosphere is either very faint or absolutely nowhere to be found.If you like anything and everything oriental, is in a hurry to taste as many type of food to post in on your FB or Instagram, and is not a fussy food critic in need to please the local authority, this is the place you have to go when you visit Singapore.Decades ago, good food in Chinatown are sprouting out of every corner. With the conservation of the building structures in the vicinity and an uplift of the image of the area to appeal to more tourists, major changes had to be made. Coupled by the increasing rental to suit the rising economy, I'd say the original food from the olden days that really represent the actual flavors of Chinatown Singapore is no more than 5% in the remains.If, you are in for a good savour of local delicacies, head straight to the food centre on the second floor of the Smith Street Food Centre. You will be in for a treat if you wake up a little earlier, though many of us are speculating that it will soon be removed, you will still get a chance to experience the local "wet market" at the basement, shop for some unusual items on the first floor at the shops where our parents find their hippest clothing back then, and savour on the good old delicacies in the maze of food stalls on the second floor. Be ready to perspire a lot as it may be superbly crowded and hard to find a seat during meal times and left with minimal options when some of the better stalls close early in the day when their food are sold out due to popular demands. So, that is a choice to make. :)For the food stalls and restaurants outside on the "food street", they are not bad too. But...to me, when I travel, I'd tend to avoid eating places I see too many tourists and few locals. My theory is - if the locals are not even buying, how good can it be?Last Sunday, I was there for an afternoon walk-around. It was years since I last dined anywhere on that appealing street. Lured there by the recent multimillion facelift, with an expensive lotus leaf looking shelter storeys overhead, I thought it was cooler and I could stay longer to try some of the food.I chose a Dim Sum place and it was so-so. When the bill came, I felt like my first trip to Bangkok and when I first found out the meaning of the Thai word "farang". Consoling myself, I told myself I needed a trip to rejuvenate anyway and that I couldn't do it with my busy schedule lately. It felt good to feel like a tourist in my own country.I'm no food critic. Even if I was, food is a very objective item to appraise. Being in the army before, I would only tell if this food is so bad that it makes me purge the whole night through, or this stall owner is really out to con my money.The rest, you choose your own adventure and share them with me if you will. :

I recently brought a bunch of visitors here as it is pretty convenient from the Chinatown hotel they are staying. The new glass roof is a refreshing change from the old setup, but I was surprised by the steep increase in prices of all the food stalls after the recent revamp. Clearly all these changes are designed with the tourists in mind, hoping to cash in on the busloads of tourists visiting Chinatown. Would recommend others to take a short walk across the road to the Maxwell Food Centre, which has much better tasting food at more affordable prices

The Chinatown Food St just underwent a multimillion $$ revamp and re-opened late Feb 2014. It now features a glass ceiling canopy to shelter the street, some cooling fans, and a selection of 24 renowned hawker stalls and 6 shophouse restaurants.As a local, I have to say while the sprucing up works are nice, the food is a real let down. Granted these may be brand name heritage hawker stalls they've curated here, however the people manning the stalls are mostly hired hands that execute the dishes poorly.Of the dishes my group of friends tried, only the Katong oyser omelette was authentic and delicious, and the chef looked experienced. The satay bee hoon was gluey and the sauce not balanced with too much tumeric, the popiah was bland, the bak chor mee was alright but also a bit gluey, and the rojak was plain disappointing as the crullers and bean cured puffs were starchy since the servers did not bother to re-toast them as any decent rojak seller would. And this after we asked the seller twice to do so. Clearly the young guy dishing this out does not give a damn.The ambiance is quite busy and festive though, and this is Chinatown so I think out-of-town visitors will still enjoy this place - since they probably won't be able to tell good local food from the not-so-good or even bad anyhow.For longer-staying visitors who want a taste of true blue Singapore food and don't care for a festive ambiance, give the tourist trap a miss and try one of the local hawker/food centres instead. The massive Chinatown Food Complex is just a minute away from the food street, or there's Maxwell Centre about 5-10 minutes away. For the more adventurous, try Old Airport Road Food Centre a little further away. You can read my blog post about it here:untouristsingapore.wordpress.com/2014/03/28/old-airport-road-food-centre-an-institution-

Chinatown Food Street. Renovated. Revamped. RUBBISH is what I say!!! Variety? Yes. Offering everything from Rojak, Laksa, BBQ chicken wings, Hokkien Mee to Chicken Rice. Each vendor using names of famous and well known stalls past and present all over Singapore. I am pretty sure they have bought the rights to use their names and that's where it ends. I bought a plate of Satay Bee Hoon. " No bee hoon please and extra cockles!" My mouth was already watering!!!!! For $6, I was given a teeny tiny portion of a few strands of kangkung, 1 measly small shrimp, cockles that were barely recognizable, 3 thin strips of cuttlefish and 2 slices of pork. Shocking!!!! But was it yummy, you ask? NO, it wasn't. Next up, Odeon Beef Noodles. Sticky starchy gravy, undercooked noodles, a few slices of beef and tendon, no garnish, a bowl of soup and $ 7 later, after 3 spoonfuls, I've pushed it aside and have gestured for the cleaners to take it away!!!Still hungry and dissatisfied, I order a combination platter of char siew (super thin, fatty and sweet), roasted duck (melt in the mouth, very promising) and roast pork ( so-so only, skin not crackling, not crispy). I give it a 4/ 10. I paid $10, by the way. Tiny plate might I add. Fried Hokkien Mee was nothing to rave about. Not good, not bad. I've had better. I'd describe it as....meh!?!Notice someone walk past with Poh Piah and jump up thinking how one can't really go wrong with Poh Piah? The answer is: WRONG. VERY VERY WRONG. 2 rolls of TASTELESS, limp and very bland, unappetizing wraps. My goodness!! Another $5 down the drain. Same cleaner, bless him, clears all our barely eaten plates of food and with his toothless grin asks mum and I what was wrong with everything. Well............Sigh!Chinatown Food Street might get away with fooling tourists into thinking that this is what good local hawker fare is. But for me? A complete and utter disappointment. What a let down! Overpriced and one of the worst experiences eating out in Singapore

I ate here for 3 nights straight after my first try. Food comes fresh and hot, most of them cooked in front of you. I've had char kway tiao, carrot cake(brown), satay, roti canai. All of them were great. Juices are fresh, calamansi (Philippine Lime) juice was not made out of syrup concentrate like other hawker places. Clean hawker food. Tables are quickly cleared so even if the place was packed, finding an empty table was easy enough without waiting long. Food is so cheap but has restaurant quality. Most dishes are about 4-6 dollars(excluding those with seafood). Juices are on average 2.50 - 3 ish, can of Tiger beer is $5.Bad side: One of the backpackers I befriended and had one meal with did not receive the food she ordered. She threw her ticket away, thinking she didn't need it anymore - she waited for a while and after a long time she asked for her dish they wouldn't acknowledge her without her ticket so she just donated money to that stall(carrot cake one)
4
We only ate here once, but were really impressed with the quality of the food which was better than at other similar markets. Remember that each stall is a separate business, so just because one is outstandingly good or bad does not mean all the others are the same.Prices are rather higher than most hawker centres, similar to prices charged at Singapore Food Trail, and rather higher than charged at the Maxwell Rd Hawker Centre just across and along the road.We were disappointed that the only stall that had fruit refused to sell us fruit (a standard item at Hawker Centres) without converting it into juice. We can‚Äôt comment on the toilets as we never used them.We were lucky to find a table at the edge, because personally I found the tables further in too noisy (and too surrounded by stalls) for comfort. I note several reviews say it‚Äôs hard to find empty tables, however whenever we passed there always seemed to be some space. Useful as it's near the city centre, not far from Chinatown MRT. But overall I prefer Maxwell Rd Hawker Centre, it's cheaper and has more quiet tables

You dont have to goto Clark Quay to taste their famous chili crabs and hainanese chickens and pay 3 to 4 times the price if you get it from ChinaTown Food street in Singapore. The taste is very much the same and you can see the food cooked infront of you
1
The food is hawker but the prices are pretty upmarket; most waiters or stall holders - the non-Singaporeans do not speak English and it is a hassle getting them to explain the dishes/prices! Queues are long; no seats especially when the "choppe" fever sets in. The toilets - go n see for yourselves - no, in other words DON'T they are so filthy

Awesome is the word for Chinatown Singapore Food Street. I went out walking from Fullerton Hotel and went around various streets until I saw the gates of Chinatown and was intrigued by all the lanterns hanging in the streets. The place is bustling with people and sizzling food and people chattering over dinner. I went to the first or second shop from the entrance of the street and ordered a Tom Yam Goong along with a grilled Eel with Chilli Sauce. The food came in five minutes ago and if I wasnt very hungry I would have never been able to finish it. The soup bowl was massive with seafood filled to the top! The grilled eel was served on a banana tree leaf and was sufficient for two people without any issue. The price was peanuts when it came to the flavor, taste, ambiance and freshness. I went to eat another day to Clark's Quey and decided to cancel my reservation and go back to Chinatown for another serving of my favorite soup! It is a great place to visit at night for some of the best food you would have anywhere else!

if you are looking to street food they have many options,bit difficult to get table to sit because seats are limited but worth to try
5
If you are looking for food that will satisfy your stomach and your pocket, go to Smith st. in Chinatown, Singapore. Food is served hot direct from the kitchen and very appetizing! I gained a lot of weight in 4 days!
4
Liked: I like the place there, easy to find food and local food in SG. And also if u want to buy cheap bargain can go there. Nothing disliked. Very convenience.
2
If they had enough seats! Such a busy little street, Smith St. Lots of food options, with street "stalls" in the centre of the street, and restaurants on the side. The stalls sell mostly hawker food. The was a 30 minute wait between ordering and receiving food at the satay stall. Almost impossible to get a table to eat. Had to share, which isn't a problem, but it took a few tries asking people until I actually found someone who'd let me sit with them. Food at most of the stalls is good, and quite well-priced, but some of the staff at the stalls are so unorganised and lack of seating to eat meals is a real problem here. Get off at Chinatown MRT to get here.

I gave Chinatown a go a couple of times while in Singapore as I was staying nearby. There's no doubt it's a large area and there is a huge array of eating places to choose from but I found it just another Chinatown although bigger than most. The markets are full of trashy stuff, apart froma small section which was a bit more upmarket. I visited the Buddhist temple one morning which was impressive, especially as there was a service underway at the time. Actually spending time during the day wandering the side streets was the best Chinatown experience I had.
4
Loved the atmosphere in Chinatown Food Street. We ate at the same place, the couple of times we visited. The food was quick and fresh and delicious. Favourite dish was the Garlic Beef Stir fry. We enjoyed walking around smelling the different restaurants, looking at the different foods on offer
1
You should have a strong stomach and no sense of smell if you wander too close to the bathroom in this place. Yuck. The food is marginal, most of the stands serve their food at basically room temperature which- in Singpore is around 90 degrees. It is like a petri dish
5
There are no words enough to describe this gastronomic paradise for every foodie travelers out there. The streets of Chinatown smell of delicious food, authentic regional cuisines and native refreshments. Who could say no to chili crabs and black pepper crabs? And you really have to sample their cereal prawns, stingray and the all-time favorite Hokkien Mee. This is also the place where you can find the Traditional Desserts for those eager to satisfy their sweet taste buds. Chinatown Food Street is synonymous to happy tummy
4
We used to use this outside eatery regularly but it is not as good since a new owner took over. The food is still ok but has not got the flavour that the old owner had. Maybe they have cut out the MSG. Still a nice meal and plenty of choice when visiting Chinatown and of course all washed down with a nice cooling Tiger beer (don't forget to ask for a small one or you'll get the litre bottle)
3
To be fair , you can find many delicious food varieties in this place. However when we visit each time , you can see used bowls , plates , soiled tissues all over the place , some even on the floor. Some hawkers are very rude and aggressive , you give them your order and they don't bother to pay attention , maybe because their business so good they can simply ignore you. Expect to wait very long and in the end no food arrived which happened to us 3 times
4
Great for a cheap meal, lots of choice and good food. The environment is great, you feel safe and an interesting place to look around.
4
What can you say about a hawker centre! Noisy, busy, vibrant, full of culture and great low cost food. If you can accept the bustle, the noise and the local cultural atmosphere you will enjoy yor meal.
5
It is really a food paradise in the heart of the city. You can find all the singapore must try dishes there with a reasonable price. The concept of this street is like a Hawker center on the street. There are many stalls along the pavement and you will sit in a blocked road alfresco. What a cool place! Fried kway teow - fried rice noodle with cockles, fish ball, and bean sprout is so famous that you have to wait a bit long. The chendol dessert is also a good choice. Otherwise, you can order fresh seafood from a stall, sambal stingray is my best recommendation with can of beer.You also have Vietnamese cuisines to consider in the Yummy Viet restaurant opposite the stalls side. The food is authentic, try the Lotus stem salad

Dining outdoors at hawker stalls, food courts and the make-shift street side restaurants is a popular way to eat out in Singapore. In Chinatown you can find street dining on Smith Street, also known locally as Food Street. You'll find this on the Chinatown Heritage map if checking out the attractions & places to eat in this area of the city. It is quiet on Food Street during the main hours of the day but there are usually a few restaurants in the area that will serve you. The real action picks up at nighttime when all the tables are set up and the crowds begin to arrive for their outdoor dinner and drinks. We've found the food here to be a bit pricey compared to similar food courts in the nearby area at Chinatown Complex and the Maxwell Food Court, which seems to offer more reasonably priced dishes. In this sense, it does seem like the vendors on Food Street are pricing up for the many tourists that pass by this area. Worth keeping in mind if you are watching your budget. Overall, its well worth trying a hawker, street of food court meal at some point during your trip to Singapore as this is a very popular way to dine locally. The experience is quite casual and relaxed, and you can save quite a bit compared to similar dishes being served up in Singapore restaurants. Food can be good as well. If in Chinatown, this is a popular location to have this experience

Food street is not as busy as it used to be. A lot of stalls are closed. Which is a bit puzzling ... but don't be put off, it still gets a number of patrons. And tables fill up in the late evening at weekends.Worth a trip to visit the fish food stall which is the last one at the South Bridge Road end of Food Street. Try the sting ray, it is BBQ and comes with chilli. Not too spicy but very tasty. For two people - if you order one medium size and two small veg and rice plus a beer - should be around 25$ from memory. That's not stinging the tourist. Locals eat here. Which is good value. Beware of over ordering on tiger prawns otherwise you will find the costs sky rocketing!Enjoy ... order, take a seat, smell the cooking, and the beer lady will come to your table to take your beer order (pay separately)
3
like previously mentioned this place is pretty touristy and i think over priced. However, there are a few 'local' foodcourts full with local working people. The food at these courts are great. I can't remember the names of the courts, but there are three close by. My favourite was small, followed by a large one located up stairs - great discription :). Anyhow, have a walk round and you should hopefully find these. Very cheap also, Thai green curry for 3$
3
Cute at a glance, with red lanterns hanging all down the street, but filled with very touristic shops with pushy vendors touting wares that I wouldn't buy. However, the old-fashioned architecture was interesting to look at, and the Chinatown MRT is conveniently located at the end of the street.The only stall we could find open late for dinner a Wednesday night was a Japanese Korean place. I got the chicken bibimbab for $4.00, while my bf got the kimchi udon with beef for $3.80. He liked his meal, but I was a bit disappointed with mine. The food wasn't very hot, and the rice didn't get crispy in the plastic bowl
3
If you don't mind being overcharged for average food with poor service go no further than the Chinatown mainstream hawker stands and restaurants. Otherwise brave the food stalls at the Chinatown complex or upstairs inSmith st or Food st for the cheap taste treat the locals eat
5
Smith St is also known as Food Street. On our journey around Singapore and Malysia the visit to Smith Street provided our most memorable meal. Sat on wooden benches drinking ice cold and relatively cheap Tiger Beer we had a range of dishes all of which were spiced to perfection. Food was ridiculously cheap. Even if you are only in Singapore for a short time, find Smith Street and you won't regret it
4
So much food, so many choices. Pays to look around, there was a lot of variation in food prices. I ate at Fatty Wengs and the chicken dish I had was delicious. I also tried for the first time, fried pork chop - Chinese style and it wasn't bad. The service was friendly but you do pay more than what hawkers charge
5
Hainese Chicken Rice... Thai Green Curry... Nasi Lemak... BBQ Seafood... Dishes that Anthony Bourdain would delight in! Flavours, smells and sights of Singapore - the eclectic mix of eating magic...!
4
Have a wander through the centre for a glimpse of locals shopping and eating, and don't be afraid of sampling good wholesome food.
There is even a beer shop selling bottles of Fullers & Badger beers!
3
cheap foods from desserts to noodles and everything you've wanted to eat , the place is located in the middle of Chinatown at Smith Street.
4
The dessert stalls are quite good. The satay is very popular.
4
Eat like a local-go to the hawker centres! Lots of choices-I had stir fried noodles and my wife enjoyed chicken and rice. Yum. Cheap, good eats.
4
Finish a busy day with a visit to Food Street. If you're prepared to eat rice or noodles, you can have a tasty meal for a few bucks. During busy periods be ready to wait to get a seat. Snaffle a table as diners leave, and have it cleaned promptly. Stay seated and wait for drink service that's usually fairly speedy. A great place to try some different dishes. Family friendly
4
There is nothing like eating street food. Chinatown Food Street takes it to another level, with a whole street lined with food vendors and tables. I chose the kwai teow with seafood and chilli - it was cooked before my eyes fresh. The dim sum vendor surprisingly had really fresh dim sums on offer as well!! Of course there is the drinks vendor, where a long neck of Tiger can still be had for a reasonable price.In fact the only real downer was the lack of a 'won ton mein' vendor!! For a cheap eat, interlude while wandering thru the chinatown markets, or just for some good quality food, go there!
5
Smith St Hawker centre provides a variety of great chinese food for very cheap prices. Main meal generally costs about $ 5.00 AUD.Very good atmosphere, loads of local people and tourists eat here.Ate dinner here almost every night on our 8 day stay in Singapor
4
Going into Food Street in Singapore is like putting a child in a sweet shop. All of the restaurants and street stalls looked good. Not glamourous and not fine dining but so much choice. All of them appear to be well regulated and clean. As for the food, look at the pictures and descriptions and point. A large portion where we ate was about √Ç¬£6 but the quality and taste was excellent. Be brave, you won't be disappointed and none of us had problems the following day either...know what I mean
4
Many places to eat-you only wish you had enough time to try them all. Take a stab at it and try the ones that look best to you. If you aren't sure what to get, look at what diners are eating and dive in--make your selection and enjoy
