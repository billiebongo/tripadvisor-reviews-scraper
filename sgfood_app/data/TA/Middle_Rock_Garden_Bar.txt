As a local it's a great place to be. Especially if you smoke. Plenty of outdoor seatings with reasonable dishes. Daily happy hour is offered.
Easy to find. enough parking space.

A fantastic place to eat in a beautiful public park. Food and drinks were excellent, there was even a happy hour drinks menu which lasted more than an hour. Plenty of outdoor eating space ... and music to listen to whilst eating and drinking. Well worth a visit or two.

We have been coming here fairly regularly since we moved to the area 6 months ago. It's a real treat to discover hidden away in the middle of the park. The atmosphere is brilliant, the surroundings lush and tropical, the menu is European with an Asian twist. Brunch menu is on most of the day at weekends and has something for everyone.Plenty of cocktails, wine is good, beer a little pricey.Day times its great for all groups including families. Evenings it transforms into a magical garden party, with quiet tables for a romantic dinner or a lively bar for cocktails and tapas.We love coming here - a real treat.

Nestled in bishan park 2, I've visited Middle Rock regularly in the past few years as I live only 10min away and have dined and wined at the place pre and post-reno. I applaud them for the improvement in the dinner menu post reno - I've tried the lobster pasta (my fave), the grilled salmon, the crabmeat pasta, beef cubes and most recently the goat's cheese salad (my new fave). Food is fantastic and there are happy hour drinks till 8pm. Service standards is not very consistent but generally ok. It's a nice place in the hood to have a satisfying meal and chill with a beer after a hard day's work.

As they had Martini deal on Tuesday, I tried it. Not good at all. But if you wish to have beer and some snack, very relaxing and cool area. Especially if you live around this area.Pork rack is not recommendable. Salad and pasta are not bad.Will I come back agin? If my friends around this area invites. Probably not on Tuesday. Will go for another days where they have wine promotion

Like the different choice of seatings you can chose from, sofa, bar counter, table setting etc. to suit the different occasion. The staff is very accomodating and volunteer the promotion without us asking for it. Love the Lamb Shank, big portion and it was very tender. However the alcohol content to the cocktails seems abit flat, maybe its because its 1-for-1 (hahah

Visited for post-dinner cocktails after reading a great magazine review. The good news is, the setting is fantastic. Very unique, with loads of great little nooks and crannies tucked into corners of lush outdoor garden. The music was perfect… not loungey or jazzy, but a little more “chilled-out bar atmosphere” and just the right volume. Even on a hot night, the outdoor fans kept us cool. The lighting was minimal, but that just added to the “sitting in the jungle” vibe. My biggest complaint… the cocktail menu was seriously uninspired. About 15 basic offerings, like the Sling, Mojito etc… I wanted to see something unique or interesting on the menu, but was very disappointed.Also… don’t even think about visiting if it’s raining. The indoor area is small and (I can imagine) would get crowded in bad weather
