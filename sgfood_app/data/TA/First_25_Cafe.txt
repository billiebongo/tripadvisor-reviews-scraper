Truffle fries are really good. Their sliders are ok only. A really good place to have beer and fries/snacks if you are in the area. Not much crowd at night, so you will definitely enjoy the cafe almost to yourself

The cafe is located near the CBD area and is a place to relax and unwind after a Long day at work. Happy hour is 1 for 1 pint at $14++. Food was good especially the tom yum pasta. But the service was a little disappointing, the server was sulking and pulling a Long face all the while. She could use a little smile every now and then ^

My personal observation while having my dinner in the restaurant. Here are my humble suggestions for their Improvement:1) Signage on top of its entrance needs stronger lighting at night. It’s your SIGNAGE to attract customers.2) Ambience may have been short changed without turning on all lightings within premises. The chandelier atop my table looked rustic with style - but no light. 3) The inside wall at the entrance didn't look fitting with the rest of the concept. Wall paper or white wash may be better. (or maybe because the lights were not on fully that causes the misfit look and feel)4) Table promotional message expired, and it shouldn’t be there there. At least, cover with daily menu or instruction on how to order your beef to your liking.So what’s good?1)Beef in a pan was good. Like the sliced potatoes, soft broccolis and carrots served in a hot pan - delicious. The medium well done beef was slightly burnt but taste was to my liking. Worth the try ***/52)Servers were well mannered and helpful ***/53)Heavy Cutleries ****/5 (this is personal, can’t blame me)4)Music was good ***/5Summary1)Food is worth the try 2)Ambience, please don’t short change your customer impression of your restaurant. That’s the last thing you want to give to your potential customers by-passing the restaurant

Tucked along a quiet row of shop houses, I decided to visit after seeing a friend's Instagram post of a delicious gnocchi. Visited the cafe on a late Saturday afternoon and it was almost empty. Soothing chillout music and free wifi was a plus. Red Velvet cake: rich, moist, good amount of cream cheese. Fantastic!Gnocchi: beautifully plated with a flavourful palette. One of the best I've have. Beef Hamburg: tasty and very good as quoted by the Husband. Truffle fries: a dish that can't go wrong. My Son loved it too. Definitely a treasure found, will visit again for its offerings, price and ambience.
