Apparently it was famous for the beef but end up the pork bone soup base tasty nicer. Beef soup lack a bit of concentrated taste that was expected. Side dishes are pretty well.

Vwey authentic noodle and aoup. Like the beff broth especially. Reasonablw priced but need to be careful as your bill will become expensive when you ordered the side dishes as you lost count of the order as everything you want to order.

Have been a casual fan of LeNu ever since they opened an outlet at Compass One. Their beef and fish soup range of noodles are very palatable; especially the broth used for the fish version. As the place does nor take reservations, the queues during dinner time can snake to quite a length, and the scenes in the restaurant can get quite chaotic. I would like to commend the service crew for dinner on 23 Feb 2018. Not only were they extremely polite, but they were highly efficient, proactive and extremely service orientated. I have only experienced such exemplary service at fine dining establishments, so it came as a pleasant surprise that this crew could have such an impact. Kudos to each and every one of them. They deserve to be examples for the service crew at other outlets to follow.

Went there also a few before writing this review. Had eaten fish noodle soup, dry beef noodle, dumpling noodle soup which is not bad at all. The broth is thick enough to enjoy it. The restaurant can't accommodate a big crowd. Mostly customers are in two to four.The soya drink is not those you are expecting. It is from soya can which I don't like. Usually I don't order the drink
