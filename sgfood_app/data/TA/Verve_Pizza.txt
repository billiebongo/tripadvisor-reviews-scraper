Ordered the pizza through food panda really late in the evening.
The pizza was delivered promptly and was amazing.
Would recommend Verve pizza to anyone who is unsure of what to eat and fancies a good Italian pizza.

Good pizza and value for money! Service is just fine. Hard to find entrance, and there are only outdoor seating. All in all, good restaurant!

No questions, Verve is serving one of the best pizzas in town with thin crusts. Do not miss the pasta dishes and the fresh salads with good cheese. They also offer a delivery service from 11:00 am until 9:30 pm. Just call: 85222767.

These are our regular signature dishes... not yet found something as good anywhere else in SG !! Outdoor seating is great when the skies are cloudy & there is a gentle breeze - fabulous views of the marina area !!
3
Verve pizza is in a somewhat desirable location near the marina bay, but the prices are so expensive! Beware of the 10% service charge, as it all adds up. Nice food, nice view, big prices...

We went there on a Saturday night after dinner for some drinks. Location is great for people watching. Service was very friendly and efficient. The only negative side is that there was barely any alcohol in my frozen daiquiri, tasted more like a frozen fruit smoothie

Singapore is a MEKKA of great food, wine and exciting places to see and explore, but this is BY FAR the place to go for pizza, good wine and an amazing wiev! It's places right next to Marina Bay Sands and absolutely gourgeous to sit ther at any time of day enjoying their food :) The service is excellent too! I lived there for a year and went numerous times, never disappointed ! I HIGLY recommend it to everyone!

I came here with my partner on a Monday evening. The customer experience was appalling from the very beginning, with a rude and pushy manager showing us to our table. From here the service was extremely slow, despite the restaurant being very quiet, and we had to wait a long time to be seen to and we were never asked whether we needed anything else. Our food did not come out at the same time even though there were only two of us with a pizza each and no apology was offered for the delay. When the cheque came we enquired about the huge service charge that had been automatically added (I believe this happens everywhere in Singapore) and my partner expressed how he felt we had not been given a good level of customer service- we were offered no apology, the manager only responded by saying they had bought the food to the table and that was service enough. The food itself was actually quite nice, however due to the poor level of service the night sadly wasn't worth the money or effort

There are still a few places in Singapore that won't give customers the perfectly drinkable tap water. They foolishly try to rip off tourists who don't know better and they drive away locals.The server embarassedly said her boss was strict about it. Regardless of the food quality, this is unacceptable. Small pizza $26. Pasta $23. I'll take my business to many of the real restaurants that have common sense to know I'm happy to buy wine and beer, so long as they serve water. Sad penny pinching owner. Looks like they don't seek return patrons

The restaurant location is awesome overlooking the Bay which was a fantastic view at dinner time. However food wasn't that great. My wife's pasta was lukewarm at best and my pizza wasn't that great either. For the prices they charged we expected much better quality and taste which unfortunately wasn't the case..
4
Came here for dinner and ordered the cream based pizza which cost SGD26++. It's really nice. The pizza is big enough to share esp. if one is not that hungry. It's thin crushed and there's 8 slices.
4
My husband and I visited Verve Pizza on our first night in Singapore. We sat outside and enjoyed the very nice food, cocktails and the lovely views of Marina Bay.
4
When we fancy a consistently good pizza this is on our list, there is something about Salami in Singapore, it always seems to gamey, but I guess that what happens when you spend to much time in Italy. The Calamari is not bad to! And they often have happy hours (yesterday was 50% of drinks 4-5, and 25% off from 5-6

Eating Al Fresco at sunset in nice surroundings. Life can be bliss if you make it. The food we ordered was well cooked and came to the table reasonably quickly. It wasn't a knock-out Italian meal but quite pleasant. It started raining part way through the meal and the waiters were quick to deploy the mechanical awnings and this ensured that our outdoor dining experience wasn't spoilt in any way. The place is located at the western edge of the Marine Bay area but it still a good place to hang out and look across the Harbour. Worth a visit
1
Sat at a table ar 22.20 and the waitress told us orderby 10.30 i close at 11. Expensive bill for 4 pizzas and 4 drinks. The foid was ok but nothing special. The waitress cheered as she took our plates . Will definitely never go back and never recommend i
1
Worst customer service ever. We ordered drinks, starter salad and pasta at > $100 for lunch. We also asked for iced water but they refused! Starter arrived when we had al,oust finished our pasta with no apology that it was so late. It too I forever to flag down the waitress for service all throughout the experience. Finally when it came time to pay, the credit card machine was broken and we were made to wait for ages. The food was ok, not great, but e very poor service resulted in an unpleasant experience overall. We will never go there agai
3
We had great pasta and fish and chips here - prices were reasonable for the area, and service was good, apart from the waitresses having a tiff and forgetting to provide us with eating implements - we grabbed what we needed from the next table. Generous portions and a pleasant outdoor setting - just don't sit under the speakers if you don't like loud booming music
4
We came upon this restaurant during our hop-on-off bus tour. We expected the prices to be crazy here in the spectacular surroundings, but were pleasantly surprised.In November we were able to sit outside in the shade, and had a simple lunch of pizza and beer. The food was much better than some of the awful stuff we'd had in this city.  The service was a little slow.It is a little out of the way, but we rate this place highly for the budget-conscious diner
2
Did a group visit here, ordered a few different pizzas & meals & nothing was worth talking about or recommending! The duck pizza was horrible as it was way too sweet. Service needs improving! And on the cleanliness level they get a zero(0)! Tables needed to be wiped & it wasn't until way down after we ate realised the bathroom was filthy as if it had not been cleaned in a week! Definitely not worth a visit as also very overpriced! Way too many nice places in Singapore to eat & hang than to settle for this mediocracy!
2
Well, I don't expect good service in Singapore's restaurants and I cope quite fine without much attention, but our experience of being ignored once we had been seated was extraordinary. My email to them went unanswered and I guess that says it all. Never again. Pizza was fine. When we finally got it
5
Found this bar by chance while in Clarke Quay. Great vibrancy to the place. Food and drinks good too. A fantastic place to watch the world go by, drink have good food,. the live band is great too. What's not to like - Go!!
4
The place has good food, especially for munching and a good location for a couple of drinks with friends. It is very conveniently located near Marina Bay Sands.
5
Found this restaurant while walking round and SO glad we did. The service was excellent and the food was delicious!!! Highly recommend
2
Came here for lunch today and opted for one of the pizzas. The pizza was tasty enough but at lunchtime this place is just way too hot - they need to invest in more fans or get some indoor seating. No iced water is available either - bottled water only (at inflated prices of course)
1
I wrote to the management, gave them a chance to explain but not heard from them.Total Rip Off. Stay Away. This is one restaurant/bar who would encourage you to be intoxicated or be on diabetics prescriptions. We ordered food and just wanted a glass of ice water but staff said "The management order is that we do not serve service water". What kind of restaurant/bar that you pay hefty amount for food and drinks and could not offer 2 glasses of ice water. How much does that cost you?Staff kept insisting that we ordered bottled water which cost SGD7++ for 750ml. It is ridiculous. I do not mind paying for bottled water but definitely not at that cost. This is Singapore where tap water is safe to drink! We told the staff that they either serve us service water or we will cancel the whole meal. Staff told us it is ok to cancel. You could not believe how furious I was. We went elsewhere for dinner instead.I will definitely not go back to this place and strongly discourage everyone too. We need honest folks in f&b not a resto/bar that tries to make money out of water. Ridiculous

We were a group of 3 adults on a Thursday evening. One Pasta, One Pizza and one Catch of the day...oops, sorry, catch of the day has changed. oK we'll go with the changed catch of the day.. Drinks served but my pint spilt on my arm and leg...apologies but no replacement or recompense of any sort.. Next the pizza and pasta served but no sign of the fish which came about 10 mins later. To make it so much worse the fish was for the only lady in our party! Then, the fish was not the catch of the day and not even the substitute catch of the day but a different menu item shown as fish and chips. All too hungry to argue. I finished my pasta meal before the others and my plate was removed instantly which we considered very rude but is apparently normal in Singapore.Food OK though and probably would have seemed better if service had been a bit better
4
It is a bit out of the way but seeing we walked around the waterfront area it was the best we could get seeing the Marina Bay mall did not have much to offer. Unless you looking for something traditional to eat. Had the pasta bolognese it was delicious and the pasta is made in house you can taste the difference. Was a good meal and service was okay seeing it was closing time, just before 10pm. Pasta is between 20-27 dollars
3
The location is kind of far and in the middle of nowhere but it was recommended. Had the pasta here. The flavours were right but the linguine was not al dente - a basic to pasta. Portion was also quite little so obviously not too good for value ($22 for a small portion?!)
3
As the heavens opened we decided to stop for some lunch! We walked in and were assisted straight away, however after 20 minutes of waiting we had to call for someone to even take our drink order! The people next to us arrived shortly after we did and as the waiter walked off from taking our order they waved at him and he still ignored them - so they left! The food came out quite quickly, although my friend got her cup of tea only asking for it again and once we had our lunch! The food was lovely - really tasty and greatly presented! And after we had eaten the service did improve! Overall nice view, nice food and reasonably priced, just shame about the service, but maybe we just picked a bad day!
4
The good- The pizzas that i've ate over the past 12 months are always great.- When it rained in the monsoon we were stuck outside, and a waiter motioned for us to come under the restaurants tarpaulin. This was a very thoughtful thing to do.The bad- PriceyThe ugly- The staff are constantly leaving and are unmotivated and not very experienced at servicing customers
4
Verve at Marina Bay, not just pizza but good selection of pasta dishes too. Main courses were tasty and portions generous, with real Italian flavours! staff were friendly and every bit as efficient as many in Italy!
3
Tasty and hot garlic bread with lychee martini and as we are veggies we had crispy margarita pizza. .A bit pricey but good to special occasions and the best part is the outside sitting. .
5
A little bit of Italy, hidden away here in Singapore. The pizza was well presented and a taste to die for. Great friendliness and definitely well worth the visit, we will be back.
1
This is the worst restaurant and service sucks.the Filipino waitress too busy chattting when ask for something not with a friendly smile
4
Dinner in the fresh air
Nice location at marina bay
With lovey out door seating
My order just pasta and coke
Service very good this mean the staff well doing
Price not cheap and not so expensive
5
They do really nice and fresh pizza. Price ranges from $20-$26 and is reasonable for its big and yummy pizza. We tried their mocktail and it's really tasty too. Will definitely come back if we have a chance.

Verve Pizza Bar boasts of a great selection of authentic Italian pizza and delectable pasta dishes, with fine wine, beer and cocktail choices to pair them with. If you are sitting in one of the tables outside, you will also have a great view of the bay and the landmark buildings around it. We've been to Verve twice before and it was the same great taste, great customer service in those two times. They do have a very friendly staff and food is always served hot and rich in flavours. During the past few Saturdays though, the outdoor seating at the restaurant had been booked out days prior because of the weekly National Day Parade rehearsals. When we inquired last Saturday, we were informed that the whole outdoor area has been reserved by patrons for the actual National Day Parade. That's really unfortunate for us because it would have been great to witness the fireworks and airshow from this side of Singapore! Last time we were at Verve, we ordered the salad with warm goat cheese which we totally loved! The portion was big enough for two, even if we only got the starter size. We also ordered the parma ham pizza which was, again, another big hit as far taste and freshness of ingredients go. If you're not keen on ordering alcoholic drinks, you can opt for a mocktail or one of their milkshakes. I tried the strawberry milkshake and it was perfect! Will definitely be back a few more times.

My family brought me to Verve Pizza Bar for lunch on Father’s Day. Situated at the Marina Bay City Gallery on 11 Marina Boulevard next to a huge, open air car park, which is within walking distance to Marina Bay Sands, the restaurant uses glass walls to take advantage of the views of the waterfront and city. The decor is simple, with a vertical garden making up one wall. The ceiling has a pattern of solar cells with huge fans silently rotating. No curtains, black table tops with white chairs. Piped music. Outdoor seating. Service is not bubbly warm, even though it wasn’t crowded or busy when we entered. But our orders were efficiently taken and the dishes came promptly, almost all at once.We had the Warm goats’ cheese salad which was served with rocket leaves, beet root, dates and walnuts in a sweet balsamic vinegar dressing. This was good.We ordered two pastas; the prawn, zucchini and arugula; and the creamy bacon carbonara. The pasta is homemade. We also had the Corleone pizza which had Parma ham topped with fresh arugula and shaved parmesan. The linguine with the prawns was too spicy hot for some, as chili padi was mixed in with sliced garlic and zucchini. Prawns were juicy and crunchy, and I liked the garlic slices. The creamy bacon carbonara was not too creamy and tasted good, but I would have liked more bacon bits! The thin crusted pizza was tasty with a good spread of arugula leaves.The food we ordered and ate was good. There are other interesting items on the menu which makes it worth a return visit. There’s fillet steak, smoked ribs, burgers, grilled fish etc. yet to try.Verve Pizza Bar is a good place to sit and watch the world go by, with Alfresco seating and nice views; a well stacked bar and wine list, and lots of pizzas and starters if you’re not too hungry. Good place too for family dinners or just dining with friends. Next door is the Verve Gelato, an ice cream store serving Verve’s homemade gelato Italian ice cream.There’s happy hour from 5-7 pm everyday with free pizza samplers! On Fridays, Saturdays and eve of public holidays, theres’ additional happy hours as well from 11pm to 1 am. With free pizza samplers too! Set lunches are served with free flow of coke or sprite. $28 – Starter + Main + Free flow drink. $30 – Starter + Main + Dessert + Free flow drink.Check out their web site and check out their menu and prices. They offer take-aways too.Address: #01-01, Marina Bay City Gallery, 11 Marina Boulevard, 018940Phone: +65 66343220Opening Hours: Mon - Thu: 11:00 - 23:00 Fri - Sat: 11:00 - 02:00 Sun: 11:00 - 23:00Web site: http://www.verve.sg/ Or: http://verve.sg/?p=536#sthash.P34uoPeB.dpu

Exploring the Marina area on a hot sunny afternoon, when we spotted Verve and decided to stop for a drink but we ended up having a meal. We both had pasta which was very good and we were also given a slice of pizza as it was 'happy hour'. Pleasant spot to watch world go by and good food too

Delivery service SUCKS.They dropped a menu in my mailbox.I call the delivery number.They answer by saying no delivery because of rain.On their website it says: "In wet weather, please allow for extra delivery time"But now - no delivery.Their business must be so good that they don't need yours.Help them out - stay away
1
Change of staff has backfired, badly. Although there were no Einsteins among the old colleagues, at least they were friendly and attentive.
Now, the staff just look at you and walk past. Could not care less.
Poor.

We enjoyed an evening pizza after the Marina Bay laser light show. The service was good and the pizza, beer and cocktails were just right! Unlike some other reviewers we had nothing to complain about.
4
Nice lace to sit down and relax having a beer, hood selection of beers, pizza was very good, crusty thin bread good taste.
Area to sit down is very comfortable and with a good enviroment.

During a recent 10 hour stopover in Changi Airport we decided to book onto a 2 hr free city tour. Which was basically a tour aimed at driving tourism to Singapore by showing off some of its prominent locations mainly from a small bus. Our tour bus finally stopped for a brief walk around the marina area, giving us a break from the somewhat overload intercom spouting interesting facts about Singapore... Spotting the Verve Pizza Restaurant like an Oasis in the humid Singapore heat. Being Australian we ordered a large beer which was close to the size of a small bucket even though we only had 12mins and counting. The staff were friendly and provided us with bread sticks and a complementary slice of pizza with our Hoegaarden. Enjoyed the stop and will definitely be back next time I'm in SIngapore
4
Ordered Enzo (Peking Duck Pizza) and Fettuccine Carbonara. Thought we tried an interesting oriental pizza for a change but still ordered the Carbonara just in case the Peking Duck Pizza went wrong.The first slice in our mouth was great however subsequent slices we thought there were too much black sweet sause on it as the base and it start to taste too sweet to enjoy the pizza. The Carbonara cream sauce was thick and cheese creamy so we enjoyed that very much.The rain came... and we were only sheltered by the canvas tentage. Rain deflected into the canvas and kinda spoiled our dinner settings. Crews has to use umbrella to serve the food to the diners sitted beneath the canvas tentage. As the tentage was low, another crew has to helped the serving crew carry the brolly and lift the low tentage. Seems quite chaotic to me. Crews were also seen busy chatting loudly on their own most of the times which isn't a good sight.If it wasn't for the rain, it's an ideal romantic dining spot for couples

Last night in Singapore, walked past around 9 pm and decided to drop in. Pleasant place, just on the waterfront. Food was fine, cocktails were good. My young sons spaghetti was just warm, while everything else was piping hot. Bob Marley music playing all night seemed a bit odd for an Italian themed place.
4
Great late night option with the tomato basil pizza, very simple and tasty. More flavorful than the European/Italian authentic, but not quite as strongly flavored as American pizza. It's a good option for the location and good open-air and scenic views.Service was way better than I would have expected given the location next to MBS. It wasn't too crowded and easy for a discussion with friends
5
We are Brits living in Singapore who are lucky enough to spend part of each summer in Northern Italy. Like a lot of Singaporeans I enjoy Italian food, but much of what is served in Singapore is not authentic. Verve however, bucks the trend and does what Italy is renowned for, great simple food presented in a setting that allows you to eat informally with friends and family. I could even believe I was in Italy!My favourites: The Caprese - lovely soft Mozzarella, and the pizzas - thin crispy dough with whatever toppings you fancy.Ask to eat outside at one of the high tables but away from the rather powerful fan.The one downside is the loo which is not the cleanest - still there is always the City Museum next door!Lastly, the staff were great friendly and efficient - as we live just round the corner, we'll be back

We like this place for ordering pizzas and a beer every now and again. The location is pretty cool. One time we went and tried pasta and the bill was a downer. The food is good, but stick with pizzas. I like the pesto one a whole bunch, and the carnÃ­vora
1
I took a page about Verve out from Ex Pat Living Singapore thinking awesome, this place sounds great......Wrong...Ordered their House Special, well it's special at tasting awful.... No flavour, dry etc. Why do these places think making a think crust will suffice? Second pizza was the Mancino... Base was meant to BBQ sauce, well it had dried up, could not taste a thing. Garlic bread, so dry and if they put on any garlic it was gone by the time we took one bite and had no more.Do not eat here. You could make a better pizza at home
4
Service deserves a rating of average, but food quality and taste make the place above average. Place is a little hard to find, but worth discovering. Nice selection of beers and the goat cheese salad is an enjoyable experience.
4
We came across this little treasure by accident. The pizzas are excellent value and the staff very friendly
4
We enjoyed good service, nice pizza (and sides) and really loved the location.
No problems recommending

We decided to stay indoors this evening and Verve Pizza came in mind as we received a brochure for their delivery service. Little to know their marketing collaterals are deceiving! We ordered a pizza and a serve of tortellini truffles pasta 1. For $28, the serve of pasta was smaller than an entree portion at a restaurant. I believe there was only 12 tortellini in that miserable portion and for $28, I've had better at a proper restaurant! 2. Upon arrival both pasta and pizza were COLD as if it had been left out or have been on the road for a while. Pizza crust was too hard to even bite into 3. Toppings on the pizza was disappointing - they may as well not have any toppings at all 4. If you were going out there and to highly promote/market your delivery service, for godness sakes, please be on time! You were 40min late and not only that, you failed to contact us! 5. Very very expensive for a meal standard like that. Poorly done All in all, disappointing experience and NEVER AGAIN! Complete rip off!

I stopped off at Verve on spec and was very pleasantly surprised.It's set at the south west corner of Marina Bay and if you choose one of the high, bar stool tables on the patio outside you have a great view across the bay and of all the passing people. I had a caprese salad followed by a pizza. The caprese was very good, much better than you normally get in pizzerias. The pizza menu lets you choose from a selection of basic pizzas which you then customise from the list of additional toppings. My pizza was extremely good, the base was very light and crispy and the toppings were generous and tasty.Service was generally good, although could be slightly haphazard on occasion. The only downside was the loos. There seems to be only one, and this was occupied (by the same person, apparently) for my entire meal. If it's before 8pm you can nip next door into the City museum and use the facilities there, but after that you're on your own...But if you're in the Marina Bay area and fancy a casual meal outside rather than in the aircon in the Shoppes, I'd recommend Verve

I stumbled across this restaurant on my way back from an evening walk. It was quite late in the evening and the weather was very warm. I ordered a pizza to takeaway as I was too tired to eat out. While waiting for the pizza which didn't take too long, I was brought a glass of cold water which I didn't request for - I thought that was very thoughtful of the staff. A few minutes later, I was asked if I would like some gelato and what flavour. I mentioned a flavour and I was brought a small tub of gelato - on the house!!. That raised my opinion of the hospitality offered by the staff to a new level.The pizza tasted great and wasn't at all greasy - very healthy stuff. They also included a jar of grated parmesan cheese in the package. The food was reasonably priced and the outdoor area where I sat was neat and comfortable. Simple things like anticipating your customers' needs and meeting them in the best way possible makes for excellent customer service.I definitely recommend the pizza here and will be visting for a sit-down meal when next I am in the area.A

We were looking for a place for a large (10 pax) crowd before going to the top of Marina Bay Sands to dance. We did not want to spend a fortune since we knew the drinks up top would cost a lot. The pizzas and salads were very good, the service was good and the food came out fast. We could sit outside and they were able to handle a large party easil
3
Been there on a busy Friday night with my friend and was first ignored when entering the restaurant. Once seated,we waited forever for a menu. Service is friendly but not very attentive and professional. The food however was good! The pizzas are amazing and fresh. Still people go to restaurants for the experience, mostly food and drinks is 2nd rating.Work on the customer service
4
Had the two pizzas and tiger beer deal worked out around £40for two large pizzas and 4 beers cheap compared to most restaurants and more importantly great pizza which pleased my son who is an expert on good pizza lol!! If you want t pay £20+ and experience something different don't eat here if you need t please a pizza fan and don't want a loan to get one in a great atmosphere this ticks the boxes :

I heard the next table say that this place had the best pizza they've had since they've been in Singapore and I agree with them. Thin crust, but not too thin, still with a nice chewy texture. Simple, fresh toppings that are not too overwhelming. Could have more "posh fare" given the nice location by the waterfront at Marina Bay but seeing the restaurant's motto is 'Simple things done right' so can't fault them for that... Food is simple, fresh and good. Service is friendly. If you are a pizza lover, you have to try this. Oh, and the cocktails are good too! We were a little late but found out they have a great deal - Happy hour 5-7pm with a good discount (i think 20% off) on all cocktails and house pours and you get FREE pizza tasters (don't expect full servings but it'll give you a good idea of taste and help you decide what you want of more!)

Best pizza I had in singapore!
Splendid atmosphere!
Best for ppl who want to experience a night life!
We also got to see a belly dancing performance in the opp pub!!! 😊 It would help if they can reduce the price!
5
The best Pizza in town for good taste and fresh toppings. Thin crust in a traditional fashion. A service is great and the staff is VERY friendly.
Great way to spend a Sunday afternoon
5
Absolutely delicious, fresh pizzas. Beautiful location, efficient, friendly service and fun cocktails too! Eager to go back and sample the rest of the menu!

I went to this restaurant as part of a large group. Everyone enjoyed the food. The Pizza is particularly good, thin, crisp crust & quality toppings. Service was very good although service staff were, in my opinion a little over-zealous. We ordered drinks by the pitcher, they would observe someones glass getting low and reach between people to top up. This was distracting and sometimes startling. Once on the table, I feel guests should top up their own beverages. Staff don't know if you want more drinks and they didn't ask.We were told that tap water would not be brought to our table. Singapore has a state of the art water purification system and tap water is very good. Restaurants in Singapore are doing a real dis-service by refusing to provide tap water to patrons. I won't return to restaurants who refuse to supply water, I also make my friends and colleagues aware of what establishments will provide water and recommend against establishments that will not provide water
4
Had a nice dinner with the Verve special pizza. It was really good, but the price was pretty high - 28S$.Luckily we could share it - and both get full.We also had some interesting beers - they too are a bit expensive - between 12 and 16 S$ for half a litre. But this is Singapore - by the water, so it can be expected.We arrived seconds before a huge rain shower - and things got a bit chaotic. Get a table further in under the canopy if clouds are gathering. Service was ok - and we got both food and drinks pretty quickly - but that was probably because of the weather and therefore few guests
4
A nice little place, just before the Marina Bay Sands complex. Completely outside seating, but a nice location and definitely value for money. The pizza and food are pretty nice and tasty.Drinks are a bit pricey, and service is a bit hit and miss, but would definitely recommend a visit. Would suggest you come early and also try to sit under a fan, and it can be quite hot and humid
3
The quality pizza was marred by the incredibly slow service by the staff. We were a large group but had pre-booked. Drinks took a very long time to arrive. I wasn't timing them but I'd guess at 10-15mins. I don't mind waiting for good food but drinks should come out quickly! Prices are pretty steep but it's Singapore so that's to be expected. There is a great view over the water. Overall a nice experience but the slow service spoiled it
5
Me and My Lovely Wife;) visited Singapore for 3 days;)It is an Amazing City,we really like it over there,a part is Bloooody Expensive;) We are traveling as backpackers but we were prepared to spend extra money;)We went to VERVE PIZZA @ MARINA BAY,and that was the THE BEST PIZZA I had for long time!!! I can not remember name of my pizza,but was made with DUCK,JAPANISE CUCUMBER,SPRING ONION AND CHEESE,on nice thin and crispy base without tomato base.THAT WAS SO TASTY!!!The Pizza it's self was massive both of us couldn't finish,so we had to take rest to take away as we didn't want to waste it;) because was so DELICIOUS !!!ANother thing to mention was service,which was brilliant!All members of staff were really nice and friendly also really professional even was a Pizzeria;) included Chefs;)In scale 1 to 10 I would give them 11!!!;()B.u.J.o xx

Very good italian restaurant in Singapore! Is very close to the shopping mall, calm place not like the food corner in the shopping mall, full of people waiting for your table and looking at you when you are eating :-) The food that we tried there was very, very tasty and the pizza like real italian pizza! The food they are preparing very quick, for example for the pizza we were waiting just 7 minutes! Really recomend for who want eat italian cuisine on Marina Bay

I had dinner at Verve pizza last night and it was delightful.The food was very good and the service was simply awesome. Staff were knowledgeable about the food they serve and banter with us without intruding. The pizza was good. I think they serve among the best pizza on the island. Portion and quality of the food is good. Their homemade gelato are to die for.The manager Nicole came up to me to inform me that there were ham in the food I ordered and without hesitation offered to prepare me another dish without the ham. The service staff even came forward to apologise. Which I told both of them that it was my fault for not seeing ham in the ingredients and as such it was my fault and not theirs. Will definitely dine there again and recommend to friends.Jai 31/01/1
