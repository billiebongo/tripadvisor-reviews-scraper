This place is good for breakfast or snacks with the various dumplings, rolls and traditional chinese buns. Don't recommend the coffee though. It is spotless, good service and great value for lunch or dinner. The lady owner is helpful and welcoming.

We had a great little super quick snack dinner with dumplings and spring rolls and pork buns. Great traditional food - really enjoyed the atmosphere.

Great place for a quick brunch. The service is very fast. Tasty dumpling soups, yummy steamed nibbles, like sui mai, pork ribs, stuffed tofu, crystal dumplings. Can't leave here hungry!

Nothing fantastic. Won't travel all the way to the east to eat. Fried stuff are too fried also. Taste only so so for the dim sum.

Dinner after a 12 hour flight, close to hotel. Very quick service, local food, cheap ($30 Singapore for 2 entrees/2 mains+2 drinks- juice. No alcohol available. Cha Sui pork dumplings, stir fried Gai Lan, chicken mushroom+rice and a tofu cake with red meat sauce. Great!!

You get a variety of Dim Sum and Chinese here. I tried Noodles and dumplings. Both were good. Its a friendly place. On the whole a good place to have a quick bite for lunch before you head out for the next meeting.

I love Visiting Changi Village and eating at this Dim sum restaurant across the street from the ferry to Pulau Ubin and next door to the Changi Village Hotel. The owner keeps the restaurant extremely clean and the restroom is the cleanest one I've visited in all of the Hawker stand restrooms in that area. I tried the spinach noodle soup with wontons, the braised pork ribs and the ground meat and vegetables wrapped in bean curd paper on this visit. The last time I ate here was 3 years ago, and the food was as good then as it was a couple days ago. Highly recommended.....(also, I noticed it is frequented by many locals, which is a good sign for good food!

It was our last half day in singapore. So we decided to drop by cuppage plaza for a brief stop for brunch. This little dim sum place offers wide variations of dishes and does not disappoint. Very similar to dishes you would find in a higher class restaurant although in a simpler setting. Highly recommended. They open at 10-ish

To clarify - my visit was to the Le Xuan outlet in Cuppage. While generally a very positive and understanding person, my experience at Le Xuan was so negative that it has compelled me to pen this review.Poor customer service - there was 6 staff present including the boss himself. Requested that we (heavily pregnant wife and fat self) sit at a tight corner table despite the restaurant being largely empty. Servers would ask me for clarification on my order (requested breast meat) but failed to acknowledge my replies and subsequent drink orders.Questionable food quality and hygiene - portions were on the small side and fillings in the dim sum rather stingy (please see attached photo exhibits). The yellow mee/ noodles were clumped together which might suggest it was not stored well. Most of the seafood was powdery and heavily processed.As a former F&B operator; we would generally be more forgiving but really felt compelled to warn others and defend the industry.Sorry Le Xuan - I know it's a difficult business but please at least try.

The dimsum is good and prices are reasonable. We went around 9am and the Polo Char Siew Bao was sold out! So be there early during the weekends and PH especially!
