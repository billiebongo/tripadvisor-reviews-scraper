I wanted to like this restaurant but each dish we chose disappointed us. If you’ve been to Vietnam, Thailand, Cambodia or Laos and loved the food then like us you’ll probably be underwhelmed with River Wok.

A chance decision to eat Asian led us to this great restaurant on the riverfront in Robertson quay.As it was lunchtime we opted for a shared platter of Asian delights.Seafood was represented with prawn and crab cakes, fried chicken wings, delicious home made spring rolls deep fried and fresh rice paper rolls.To complement this we ordered two different types of rice. The pineapple rice was well presented in a half pineapple and blended with prawns, cashews and fresh pineapple. The other option was a tasty crab fried rice.The service was excellent and we learnt about the local cuisine and the strengths ( and weaknesses of the chef).A good option relax with good food and watch the world go by

Well, we wanted something authentic and were not disappointed.Great Vietnamese delicacies such as spring rolls and fresh rolls, bo luk lak and other patties; then we had the duck red curry and that was certainly the highlight of the dinner, and squids were good too.Excellent service provided throughout the evening, all in a great outdoor atmosphere.Well done!We’ll be back

Stopped here for a evening meal. Restaurant is right on the river, a lovely location. The food was extremely tasty with fresh ingredients. We ordered stir fried vegetables, crab fried rice and bbq stingray. All of which was really well cooked. Food isn’t cheap but the location and quality is worth it. Not great for vegetarians however.
