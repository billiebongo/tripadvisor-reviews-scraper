The fritters taste great and are really cheap. I like the you tiao (long fritters), ham chim peng (flat round fritters) and the butterfly shaped fritters.

This stall has been here for long time and is one of the best Fritters you get in Singapore.
There is another one in Toa Payoh

Stall #64 China Street Fritters 中國街五香胃腸 is one of the 3 Hokkien style Ngoh Hiang stalls left in Singapore. As someone who doesn't enjoy fried food much, I am doing pretty well today. This is something I'd eat & even recommend! (I told my mum about it haha.)It is fragrant, not too greasy, & they have a good variety of ingredients to select from. Perfect for sharing, or get some fried bee hoon (not pictured) to go with it & you're all set for a delicious meal. Thanks Burpple for the invite to Singapore Food Festival 2017's Hawker Spotlight!

During our trip to the Maxwell Centre Food Centre, we bought mix plate with sausage, meat roll, & liver roll. The sausage & meat roll were delicious. The liver roll was a bit too grainy for me, but then again, I don't really like liver. As you're exploring and tries bits of everything, make sure you make a stop here and try this meaty, delicious food

This stall is located inside the Maxwell Road Food Center. The food is still prepared in the traditional way and kept the traditional taste. And the price is kept reasonable too. We ordered five types of fried fritters and two packs of fried rice vermicelli - costs us only SGD6.10
