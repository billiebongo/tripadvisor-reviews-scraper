Came when it was very crowded, lucky we booked reservation. Loved their tteokbokki. The worker lady also offered to change the cooker so that was very nice
3
Quality of good food is a bit less of goodness compare to its other outlet. No doubt atmosphere is good but food choice is not much
5
The staff there was very attentive to our needs, changing the bbq plate 2 times during our one hour visit. The food was value for the money paid. Not too expensive for that variety of good.
4
Quite a wide spread of meat and side dishes. The place is nice and spacious. Good for a meal with friends. The only thing is some meat is quite tough.
3
Nice place for company gathering, cosy, food selection not much. But overall meat is well marinated.
4
There's a variety of selection, great for family with children and big groups. The waitresses were attentive and constantly top up the food and clearing the empty plates on our table.
4
Good..tho service by one staff be better who asked us to move the food on a charred plate to the clean one
4
Being a kdrama fan, hearing a restaurant named OPPA would give me thrills. I would say average, considering the place and the food. We were full but couldn't point a dish that will stand out. Oh maybe the tteok-bokki and the japchae! Drinks are tasteless, btw. Water will do :

The service at the cashier cum front desk was so bad. Arrived and told them I hv reservation with Chope, she din even bother. When about to start my lunch i ask again have you confirm my reservation from Chope? She just annoyingly asked me back : Whats ur name? And when i was about to check out i ask again can you confirm u‚Äôve keyed in my reservation? She ignored me!! I asked her politely : Hello madam, im talking to u. She replied : i got ur name oredy so i keyed in oredy. (How i know of she did or not when she just know my first name??)It‚Äôs super bad experience!! The issue is with Chope u r like depending on the merchant to ensure u will got the point LATER, if they bluff u it will be troublesome to check again later. So will be better if they can confirm our reservation up front before we go in to the resraurant.Food during lunch is super limited
4
The food was great although lacking in variety. Staff service was great, changed the grill as soon as the grill was charred. They were polite and friendly as well. There was also an absence of japchae. Overall, would still visit again as the meat was fine!
4
Good selection of raw and cook food. A bit of a noisy atmosphere but overall quite good value for money.
3
They don't serve beef during lunch. ‚òπÔ∏è They should provide more variety on their drinks. Prawns are small and not very fresh.
3
Ur usual Korean BBQ buffet with nothing to shout about~ Only some tables have the hoods to take away the smoke if not, you will be smelling like BBQ after dining~
3
Adequate variety of food given the price. No time limit so you can enjoy quality time with your friends and family!
5
Good price.
Good food.
Choice of food not wide enough.
Customer service is good.
Should provide more varieties of drinks.
4
The staff are friendly and polite. When we told them the prawns are not fresh, they immediately replace the fresh one.

Food and all were great! fairly affordable for dinner pricing, plus they had a variety of cuts of meat so thats great! Staff were okay, until they started giving us deathstares as though we were overstaying our visit - not very crowded there were still plenty of available seats around us. but besides that I think it was an overall great experience (-
3
The prices for lunch is reasonable but with a slightly lesser spread. Attracting mostly students with an even lower price for the buffet depending on age. The usual pork belly, marinated chicken, beef n pork. Spicy n non spicy options. Also has cooked food - udon, chicken, rice cakes, etc. Free flow of soft drinks, tea n water. Different soups - seaweed & cream. Rice, French fries and all sorts if sauces, condiments (with KimChi) and fresh cabbages.

Had dinner at Oppa korean bbq buffet for the first time. In terms of pricing, it's not that different from Ssikkek. I felt that some of the meat cuts were below average especially the beef ones as they felt a little bit too tough. However, they have good thick cut pork belly which was better than what i could find at other korean bbqs around this price range. Hence, if you are a samgyeopsal lover, then this is the place to come to
4
Super delicious meat, abundant and generous portions even with the side dishes, and the ventilation is good because I didnt smell like food after~
2
Limited choice as compared to its affiliated. Could be due to different concept. However, quality of food is average.
2
My second experience with Korean bbq. Sadly it was a far cry from the first one which is also in a neighbouring mall in the north side. Makes me having 2nd thought about trying korean bbq elsewhere.
5
First time to OPPA Korean BBQ Buffet, the price is reasonable as compared to other Korean bbq place. I will definitely visit it again!
4
The size per portion of meat are bigher than expected. The meat are less oily and have lesser smoke compared to other Kbbq. Hope to have more variety of meat for lunch hours. Overall, worth to go.
3
Food was really not bad. Especially the Chilli squid. However would prefer to have some desserts though!
4
meat n prawns quite gd ... we quite like the place ..go there quite often ... free flow of drinks too ..
4
The prices are very affordable that you will see alot of students enjoying their meal there. However, the restaurant seem to have a problem, lack of manpower, so the staff working will have to multitask alot, especially on crowded days, therefore you need to have a little patience to be attended. Some days the pork belly are really too fatty so try your luck then
3
I am a huge fan of Korean BBQ. This is not a place I would suggest for good quality Korean. It is a Singapore-Fusion of some sort. The service is non-existent. You serve yourself for everything and it can be VERY crowded. Definitely reserve a table! I thought the quality of meat was not that great and they did not have many of the Korean side-dishes I expected. The price was reasonable. I will not likely come back here again
4
I've been a repeat customer, usually during the restaurant's peak hours. if you're a big eater, definitely visit for weekday lunch - absolute value for money!However, I was surprised to find that their service during off-peak hours fell short of my expectations. They were less attentive and had less initiative than all my previous visits.Perhaps OPPA should work on a consistent service standard
5
The food is good and service is pretty excellent . The staff was attentive and requested to change our burnt stove without us asking .
4
The price is cheaper compared to others Korean BBQ Buffet. There's quite a number of varieties spread to choose from. Overall experience was good :)
5
Food are really nice and the price is cheaper. There are many choices for the bbq. I really enjoy the ambience.
4
Went for weekday lunch. Place is crowded due to June school holiday. Variety is lesser than dinner. Given the price paid for, I would say reasonable.
5
If you want to experience Korean style barbecue, this is a perfect place! Good selection of Soju (Korean rice Wine). Only fresh seafood's, meats's and vegetables served. Friendly and casual style of service.
3
Being there for early birthday celebration and first time try korean bbq buffet. The enviroment is quite nice but for the kids the price is too expensive as they dont really take much on the bbq foods. Not much fruits for dessert.
5
It's easy to book through chope. Food and service are good. Will recommend. Trays are changed frequently. Prawns very fresh. Meat selections are good too. The cooked food are perfect especially French flues. Always top up to ensure sufficient for diners. Thumbs up
2
The equipment was defective at times and staff there do not allowed us to change place saying that there are no Two table seat but I saw otherwise.
4
Went there for dinner and it was $24++ pet adult. The cooked food like chap chye and pancake is not so nice but the fried chicken and kimchi is not bad. We prefer the marinated meat than those that are not. Love the bacon and pork belly. Service was good, they changed the grill plate often and clear the empty plates fast. They also serve nice soju, we had the grapefruit one at a very reasonable price.
3
Our kids introduced this place at J cube to us. Its a popular eating place for youths young adults and families. Looks like also a place for NS boys to wack their appetite!The spread is quite limited but the marinated meats have beef pork chicken which taste good after BBQ. Veg is fresh. There are other cooked items such as noodles, chicken, pancake eggs, fries, kimchi, soups and rice. Oranges for fruits and free flow variety of soft drinks. Sauces are decent. The only thing to note it that we needed to change our clothing and shower after that....:
4
If you can eat a lot of meat, this is really value for money. Was hoping to see pineapple slices and maybe some more vegies.
4
This is first time we take lunch at Jcube. We enjoyed the friendly and good environment during office hours. We hope more items will be added and we will recommend this place to others.
5
Good spread of meat(Pork and beef), prawns. Like the kimchi and ready cooked food. A lot of different drinks too.
4
Didn't like the seats given but generally everything was okay, service was fine, food was great. Its good.
4
Food (Jcube) was good compared to the outlet in Causeway point. Though I live in Woodlands but I don't mind travel all the way to Jurong.
4
overall good experience, nice food and nice staff, just that floor is very slippery. more veggie selection is appreciated
4
Though there are not a huge variety of meat selection but the food quality is good! There is always abundance of lettuce and meat refills. If you are craving for Korean BBQ and live around west side area, Oppa BBQ can satisfy all your cravings. Just slip on ur t-shirt, shorts and slippers without traveling all the way to tanjong pagar or town area. The staff was attentive as well, they will take the initiative to clear empty plates and changing of BBQ hotplate without having to keep raising your hands to seek for the waiter/waitress attention. What's even best is that everytime I go, we will get a $5 voucher which we can use on our next visit. If you are visiting during holidays season, do expect a 20mins waiting time

Meat was fresh but not marinated. Limited choices. Korean pancakes were very cold. No desserts were served at the buffet table at all. Seafood was so-so, smallish prawns which were also not marinated. Sauces provided were not the normal korean bbq sauce. Overall, a very bland experience for our party of 5
5
went to book on chope last minute for some korean bbq I was so satisfy as I was late for the booking the staff hold for me for 15mins and there were a long q not only they bring to me my seat they put me near the bbq station which make us get our food conveniently thanks ^^

The staff were nice and friendly. They were prompt in their service, such as changing the burnt grill. Variety and quality of food was value for money. Been coming for quite a few times already! Just miss the old recipe for the ssamjjang, and the slices of king oyster mushroom. Hope they'll bring those back
