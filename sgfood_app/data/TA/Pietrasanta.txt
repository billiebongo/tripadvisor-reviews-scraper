Reservations a must. However in the rainy period, seemed less crowded than usual.
Great food, we shared a pasta and beef and they were divine!
The portions were split in the kitchen.
Prosecco was good too. Service is always responsive.
5
A bit far from city center but its worth it. Food n drinks are amazing n very Italian. The staff and service are very good, they are very friendly.
5
Italian food at its best.
Great quality food match with attentive and friendly service.
Try the homemade pasta with homemade sausage. Salads and pizza are also very good.
Nice selection of wine. Try the Amarone and Barolo.

Amazing burrata and grilled calamari Great service!
We were on a business dinner and the waiters were able to serve us food and wine without letting anybody wait.
Will come back again!

I was taken here by a visiting Italian and some others who dine there regularly. We were welcomed like family and had a wonderful meal. The atmosphere is informal and festive - not at all stuffy - but the food is superb. Worth a visit.

We went to a party at their La Bussola and the food was amazing, so we decided to go to Pietrasanta for valentines dinner and were really disappointed. I love eating and the experience was so sad. We ordered the antipasto misto toscano and the cold cuts were ok but the olives were horrible, somehow they marinated in a weird way they were sweet. Looked like canned black olives of the cheapest quality. The bread was nice. Then my husband ordered the fettuccine con salsiccia & tartufo nero, it was only ok but not tasty. I ordered the gnocchi gorgonzola & noci and was so disgusting I couldn’t finish it. It looked like cream thickened with cornstarch and 2 little crumbles of cheese (literally). Completely tasteless. We didn’t dare trying any desserts. The organic wine was good. Definitely we will not go back.

I decided to try this place after good reviews from my friends.Let me tell you, the food and service is excellent. It's classic Italian food that matches the quality in Italy.I had the lasagna and it was so creamy and tart at the same time. I also had the truffle fetucine and it tasted so yummy. You will not be disappointed by the food.However, the location isn't that great especially if you don't drive and I would recommend that you sit outside because the acoustics inside is terrible. You can't really have a decent conversation inside

Ristorante Pietrasanta located at 5B Portsdown Road, Singapore .There are many fine Italian restaurants in Singapore, Pietrasanta restaurant has to be one of them. The rustic homey interior is an ideal getaway from the hustle and bustle of the city to enjoy homely Italian cooking .it is a family business run by 2 Italian brothers, inspired by the quaint simplicity of the town of Pietrasanta in Tuscany, Italy. It’s focused on an authentic Tuscan dining cuisine, that one can expect fresh and delicious Italian fare. The food here is amazing, better than most Italian restaurants in Italy. The food prices aren't unreasonable. All The food that we tried were all really tasty, and Very well presented and nice portions, seasoned and cooked to perfection. One dish that really stand out it’s the handmade square pasta with lobster sauce, it was to die for. About the Service and atmosphere also get really high marks! Staff are very professional the service is excellent and very friendly and attentive. A perfect night, beautiful ambience and gorgeous food. Would highly recommend. I love it that much, I will be back. I truly recommend this place if you want high quality Northern Italian cuisine

I would like to thank Niccolo and the staff of Pietrasanta for an wonderful evening. We had reserved their private room, La Bussola, to celebrate our 20th anniversary with our friends. The food was the one of the best Italian we've had in Singapore. Their buffalo mozzarella was fresh and delicious. The serving portions were sufficient for all our guests. The tiramisu just melted in our mouths. They had plenty of choices for wine. Impeccable service and excellent food. We will definitely recommend this restaurant for any occasion.

he starters and main courses were good but I was shocked by the service and poor quality of the desserts. The owner whom I initially thought was the manager agreed to help me place a birthday candle on one of the desserts I ordered as I forgot to buy the cake for the birthday celebration. He agreed but it never came. The desserts were plonked on the table -vanilla ice-cream that sounded like ice when you knock a spoon on it. The dark chocolate cake was so thin it is seriously should be described as a tart. Finally after requesting for a candle again, the waiter stuck a candle on a plate with 4 awful chocolates which we left behind. MOST SHOCKINGLY - the bill came back without our visa card and the waiter whom we informed took so long to get back we thought they lost the card. The restaurant is under-staffed and for the amount they charge - it is disrespectful to the diners
5
The burrata salami rocket salad is very good compliments to the Chef
The truffle pasta is my preferred dish with the sliced beef.
Relaxed and calm atmosphere which is perfect way to unwind after a busy day
5
We visit pretty often and never once were we disappointed. Excellent food ! Great service!
Great for lunch or dinner - in this heat you may want to book a table inside.

Burrata cheese with the ham, rocket and tomato plate were very nice. The foccacia was great too. The (prosciutto e porcini) pizza was very nice as well. However, the spaghetti (ai fruti di mare) was a little bit too hard to our taste.Outdoor seating is just not recommended at all. Ants just never stopped visiting the plates from the ceiling. Mosquitoes are fighting for your blood
4
The first time I dined in this restaurant, i was introduced to the burrata and I got hooked! The burrata is served with rockets, tomatoes and some Prosciutto. The taste of their burrata is very refreshing. This is their specialty and itâ€™s not on the menu. The portion is good for 2 people. We usually order a burrata and a main like pizza. Very fulfilling lunchHighly recommended burrata. I like their service as well. Attentive server
5
We were a party of 6. We ordered a few appertizers to share. grilled squid , clams in tomato based soup were excellent. Fried squid too salty we did not finish it. Pizza was good too. I love the complimentary thin bread so crispy n warm from the oven! We ordered 2 prosecco (reasonably priced n very good) n 1 red wine (though a little pricey but worth the price it was excellent). The meals came up to less than S$600 which I think with the amount of food n drinks plus we had tea n coffee after the meal was reasonably priced. Is out of the way but is worth the trip there. very rustic setting. Will go back again
5
Highly recommended from a friend of friend. Some of them would even drive down from Malaysia to Singapore just to have this. The staffs were very friendly. We had a chunky tomato soup and the best grilled squid salad I ever had! The grilled squid was juicy and tender, not rubbery, served on top of balanced dressed arugula and cherry tomatoes. For mains we had spinach ravioli in butter sage sauce, tagliatelle with black truffle pate, and the house signature Pietrasanta pizza. The ravioli was good, the black truffle pate was heavenly! The pizza was just average. Overall, we had a very pleasant dining experience. Will definitely come back again for the squid and black truffle pate
5
Pietrasanta is a great dinner spot. The owners often stop by our table to say hello. Their personal touch adds to the ambiance. The entire menu is fantastic. Some of my family's go-to dishes include the burrata appetizer, black truffle and sausage pasta, the black cabbage appetizer, and the cod. Enjoy

Having lived in Rome, Italy in 1964-1966, I was introduced to this restaurant by my Singapore friend and his family.We were welcomed by our host Lucca and hostess Priscilla, and entertained by them with their famous bread and buratta cheese and prosciutto, excellent wine choices, and an unforgettable main dish of lamb and beef grill.All of this accentuated by a quite environment, with a colonial sphere.I would not hesitate to start planning my next visit ..
3
It used to be a great place to hang out with a bunch of friends over buratta, pizza and wine. That was the experience we went for to have a casual dinner. But now we need to think twice because they have really jacked up their pricing. We spent $200 for 2 adults and 2 kids with just 2 glasses of wine.The buratta and pizza is still great but not worth the $$
4
It has been our Italian fix for years. They have best burrata cheese with tomatoes and rocket leaves! Of coz it doesn't hurt to have Parma ham with it as well! Beef Tenderloin is very good too. I mostly eat seafood pasta in tomatoes spicy sauce. It's always a pleasure to end the meal with ice cream.

I've been coming to this restaurant for a long time and loved it.
Tonite I gave feedback on the unacceptable conditions of the toilets and this was shrugged off.
Hygiene is everything.
5
Had dinner last Saturday and the place was packed. The decor gives the place a nice rustic feel and the food and service was outstanding. Well recommended but please book early as this place is always busy!
4
I have been going to Pietrasanta since they opened 8+ years ago. Food is always delicious, their service is attentive and they will go off the book to cater to your tastes.
5
As usual a perfect Italian restaurant. The best burrata in town and wonderful taste on all foods, either pasta, meat or fish. Good place for celebrations. And last, dogs friendly !
4
One of the authentic Italian trattoria in Singapore. Located in a black and white colonial house inside the forest. Good selection of dishes and good wine selection. Has become one of my weekly restaurants
5
Burrata, Risotto, chocolate cake, Service, lovely outdoor and indoor setting, customization!!!👍🏼👍🏼👌🏼

Went there on a sunday for lunch . Cosy location and great food . Fresh and tasty ingredients. We had the ravioli con burrata , it was awesome . The tomato sauce was incredibly good. Pizza are also delicious. Good value for money . We will go back for sure.

Recommended to us as a good Italian restaurant, I'm afraid it did not come up to expectations. Certainly, the staff were pleasant and helpful and seated us outside as the weather was so warm. We started off with an aperitif and then ordered our food.. I fancied Ministrone Soup which said on the menu that it was thick - it was like water with a few peas floating on the top. I then had Spaghetti which had a few minute prawns , musselsand maybe a few cockles in the tomato sauce. We couldn't face the dessert, had a coffee and left. We liked the location, staff, but oh dear, the food........
2
The PLACE: very charming and warm.The FOOD: not great.The Seafood pasta - seafood completely deshelled, pre-made hours ago so seafood is tough, and sauce not as tasty as many other places I have been in Singapore (La braceria)The pizza: ok but not as good as many other places I have been (Cicheti)The calamari grilled: very good.SERVICE: TERRIBLE. They gave us a dirty spoon for my son gelato!!! They got the order wrong for my son's pizza. First course and main courses all arrived together at the same time.This place is highly overrated now. It used to be much better. Now it is very disappointing
4
Had dinner with a few friends. The burrata was excellent. Creamy and rich and it went well with the tomatoes and rocket. The barramundi I had for my main course was average at best. My wife's fettuccine with pork sausage was not bad but not great and a little salty. Service was excellent though and extremely pleasant and efficient throughout the night
5
Have been here 4 times and not once disappointed with service or food! Great place for family dinners or just to catch up with friends.
5
Restaurant is nested in idyllic surroundings of Wessex Estate, accessible by car. Great food and excellent service.
5
Solid food, greenery, good service and relaxed atmosphere. Great place for family dinner or dinner with friends. Seating options both inside and outside. Great selection of dishes, fresh pasta. Excellent opportunity to relax.

Went here tonight with my husband and two children, 2 & 5 years old. It was lovely, the food was great, especially the mozzarella (and I've had a lot, my husband's Italian) and the beef cheeks with mash were lovely (but could have done with something green like beans or spinach). The service was top notch and very efficient and accommodating.

Was here last December for department lunch in order to finish our allocated annual department staff bonding budget before the year ends. Location is out of the way though there's a public SBS bus stop right outside the 1 way main road. We drove here and there were around 5-6 parking lots in front of the restaurant though many other cars had parked parallel to the parking lots. We had made a reservation and they had arranged a long row of table for the 12 of us. The 7 of us from one end shared the following dishes:-1. Burrata with parma ham, Italian tomatoes and rocket salad (dish and price both not indicated on menu) 2. Fettuccine con salsiccis e tartufo (aka fettuccine with hand made pork sausage and black truffle) - S$27.903. Tartufo nero (aka pizza with mozzarella cheese, black truffle and truffle oil) - S$24.904. Tagliata di filetto alla griglia (aka grilled angus tenderloin with parmesan cheese, tomatoes and rocket salad) - S$35.905. Merluzzo al forno con vino bianco, olive nere e pomodorini (aka cod fish with white wine, black olives, rosemary and Italian tomatoes) - S$35.90Instead of the standard bread basket and olive oil dips one will be served upon seating, we were served toasted pizza-like-dough and salsa sauce. These were so delicious that any carbo conscious dieter will throw away the diet just for this basket! I can definitely eat these on its own as a main dish! The server recommended us the burrata with parma ham, fettuccine con salsiccis e tartufo and tartufo nero. The first dish was the burrata with parma ham, italian tomatoes and rocket salad, which the server kindly helped to apportion and served them into 7 sets. He brought out a different bottle of extra virgin olive oil and recommended us to eat with this instead. I am not a cheese person and was a little hesitant when I saw that blob of burrata. However, it was not cloying and all the ingredients blended well with it. Also another dish I can eat it as a main dish instead. The fettuccine con salsiccis e tartufo was visually interesting as I was expecting to see sliced sausages. Instead, it was minced pork. Even though we shared this (and I tried this the last), I felt the dish was a little heavy perhaps from combination of the sausage, black truffle oil and fettuccine).The tartufo nero looks simple with just mozzarella cheese, black truffle and truffle oil. It was not too greasy though there was truffle oil and I did wonder why they needed it since there was already black truffle on it. I guess the truffle oil was to enhance the smell of the truffle. This was not too bad - one can easy devour the entire pizza without feeling stuffed and sinful.I had ordered the tagliata di filetto alla griglia and requested for it to be medium well done. However the server recommended it to be done medium rare instead though I explained that I don't like the taste of blood or rawness in my beef. He ensured that there will not be the taste of rawness in it. The angus steak was lightly seasoned with salt and pepper. When I sliced it through, the steak was pinkish in the centre and the blood was oozing out. Taste wise, it did not blow me away as I had expected to be. The meat was grainy with lots of fibrous texture like. I was pretty disappointed with this dish and forced myself to swallow it.The cut of the cod fish was cod fillet steak but there was a distinct fishy smell (I am very taste and smell sensitive to fish. I do know this cod was not fresh). The restaurant was around 80% packed for a Thursday lunch and the ambience is not conductive for dates or business lunches as we had to speak quite loudly to hear one another despite us being seated close to each other.It was raining heavily half way through our lunch and was surprised to discover that the restaurant does provide huge umbrellas at the entrance for patrons to get to their cars

We started with a very good and fresh rucola Salad. Very fresh indeed!We had 3 mains:- The grilled sole fish which was very well executed- Penne with bolognese sauce was really good as well and well al dente; however- The seafood spaghetti were disappointing. The sauce was pre made and although it was tasty, you could tell it was not a freshly executed dish... Overall I would try it again but the seafood pasta is a no
4
I enjoyed my visit to Pietrasanta which had a nice relaxing vibe and great service staff. The food was good too. I had the lemon sole which was a special of the day - the fish was moist and tasty. My friend had the guinea fowl pasta which was also a special of the day and the dish was flavourful. We also placed an advanced order for their burrata and foccacia which served as a great appetizer. The burrata came with some prosciutto, tomatoes and rocket. Portsdown Road is not the easiest place to get to without a car or taxi, but it's well worth the journey if you want to get away from the crowds
4
Family enjoyed dinner en famille with osso bucco over risotto, steamed clams, pizza = half tartuffo nero and half pietrasanta and squid ink pasta w red sauce.My nephew says its a whole new level in Italian food in Singapore They were crowded and service was haphazard, forgot our antipasto misto! But we didnt need it.Its crowded, its noisy but the rustica ambience is just fine
1
Read rave reviews on trip advisor about the restaurant and went with some apprehension as I had read some not so good reviews as well and didn't know which to believe. To begin with our table outdoor was pathetic; very stuffy , lot of mossies as it's surrounded by green, so we requested for a table indoors. Fortunately they had one and we waited in the nearby alley as the lady was so rude and literally asked us to go out and wait. As my Daughter had exams we requested if we could order while waiting to minimise the time. But couldn't get a single person to talk to!When we finally got the table: we waited yet another 15 minutes to place our order. Here's the icing on the cake! They ran out of burrata ; they ran out of caprese salad; they didn't have pesto in stock to make a simple pesto sauce pasta for my Son!! The risotto with porcini mushrooms had not one piece of mushroom in it. When I asked the man; he said it had been purÃ©ed ; and that was a blatant lie as the risotto was a plain pale ghostly white with no hint of mushroom in it! They did not even serve us house bread while we waited!! When we ordered some focaccia; we got a plain crusted pizza instead in a basket which they claimed is what real focaccia is!! I had ordered penne in pink sauce (out of the menu) with broccoli and carrots and that came with neither broccoli Nor carrot but a slight hint mushroom and zucchini. We ordered a truffle pizza which they forgot to bring!!! And when we asked in the end if it was coming; they said no without a hint of apology or regret or humility!!! The gnocchi was interesting and the stuffed ravioli with burrata was really tasteless! The Panacotta was lousy and the tiramisu was very good! I certainly didn't understand how a restauarant in singapore is allowed to run full while being so short staffed and so ill prepared with ingredients!!! It's a sham! And I would certainly ask you to ignore the good reviews as a full restaurant is a true reflection of the availing of the Chef and the servers and they failed on all fronts !!

Drive passed this place and decided to have a bit of me time, coffee and maybe cake for afternoon tea. Ambience was nice. The price was a bit on the high side. I ordered a cage latte and Tuscan dessert. It amount to about S $24 including tax. Kind of pricy for one person having a cake and latte.
5
Many years as customer and quality always high and consistent. Truly italian food cooked with simplicity as real italian trattorias
5
Kitchen is authentic Tuscan style and the selection of wine (Bussola Amarone) outstanding. Eating in the hard makes you feel you are in Tuscany
3
Good atmosphere with a outdoor environment . friendly owner, chef and staff. in a area that is not so crowded nor touristy ..
4
Authentic Italian restaurant serving up great selection of fresh pastas, pizzas and mains. This place is always buzzing and a reservation is highly recommended - along with clarifications of preference for seating locations. Its a bit of a stretch for the wait staff as seating is all over the restaurant. Seafood Pasta, Veg Ravioli & Eggplant dish were very well served
1
Came a few times before and thought their food is good. Made a reservation before hand, got to the place and we were given a table right at the back of the restaurant. Sat there for 15mins and nobody came to serve us or promote about their special menu for the day. It was outdoor and there isn't a fan to our table, It was after a rainy day too, so was feeling really stuffy and damp. We requested for a change of table and although it was more than half empty, they said they were fully booked and unable to allocate us to another table. Am really disappointed with their service. So we left. Was looking forward to another nice dinner but was surprised by their lack of flexibility adjustment. Might not go back because of this experience
5
The whole family had dinner.You feel welcome from the minute you arrive. You can sit either inside or outside and the staff is very attentive.We had a "prima" and a "secondi". We all has the Ravioli for first course. Really great.For second course - half the table had the backed Cod and other half of the table had the Ossebuco. The youngest had a pizza. Everyone was very satisfied.To pock a decent wine we were let into the wine cellar to choose aided by a competent help. We had a bottle of Barolo (Gaja).Desserts were coco sorbet, ice cream, tiramisu and panna cotta - each their own choice.It seemed like it was just one of those evenings were things just click :-) We will be back
5
A truly magnificent place for amazing rustic Italian. We were offerred the Burrata, and we got heaps (maybe 200gr or more) of one of the best quality Burrata we've ever tasted....the ingredients (balsamic, olive oil) are just top notch quality. Then the Ravioli, w/ tomato and burrata is another amazing dish. The tomato and pasta were of exceptional quality.Another pasta w/ truffle oil was also superb.The mackerel (grilled n smoked) w/ thyme and garlic matches well with the wine that Davide, the sommelier, paired with
4
Visited this place several times for business and with the family. Food never disappoints, expecially the fish specialties but the vine seems overpriced. Loved the grappa after the dinner and the attentiveness of the staff, primarily the young Italian fellow (sorry forgot the name) who was fun and friendly
3
Still great ambience and service, but honestly the food used to be better. The seafood soup has prawns that were chewy and clearly frozen and the salads were forgetful. The main course of the angus beef and pasta were clearly better but there are so many choices of good italian food today that provides wider choice for the customer. Service is still fantastic though
4
Had dinner at this very hard to book and not that easy to find place... It's tucked away from most of the city in ports down road and not really very accessible. But the Italian fare is good enough for a 3.5 star rating... Nothing really fanciful or super innovative... But if its traditional Italian that you fancy with a good selection of vino to go along.., don't need to ask for the wine list cos they don't have it.. But they will gladly lead you to their cellar in the main dining room to have your pick. A nice place to wow a date or celebrate that special occasion and get away from everyone..
5
A perfect restaurant, dog friendly with good area for all dogs. The food is perfect and the special "burrata de buffala" is a "must".
Delicious.
1
Burrata cheese appetizer was very good.
Dinner was average.
Attitude of the server was the worst of any restaurant I have visited globally. Manager was gracious and advised "not the first time" relative to the professionalism and attitude of the waiter.
4
Great for both lunch and dinner, have both indoor and outdoor seating, booking required especially for weekend. Fantastic service by such attentive staffs and the food is definitely worth the value. Travel over by private car or taxi will be better, currently just 1 bus service that loops around the area
3
First visit was probably almost a year ago and had good memories. This visit was kind of mixed. Started with the varied insects flying around our table as indoor tables were full. My girls were quite distracted. At some point, noticed fresh lizard droppings on the table. Hmm... don't want to think if any could have landed on our food. Cold cuts, ravioli, stewed beef cheek and mango sorbet were good. Toasted focaccia at $7.99 quite a rip off; most places serve complimentary bread. Seafood linguine was over cooked and the seafood were small diced pieces that felt like pre-cooked base. The melted choc cake was also disappointing; no flowing choc lava.There are indeed some other similar priced Italian restaurants with better consistency and ambience. Never tried lunch. Maybe better value and less insects
5
Our sixth visit to one of our favourite restaurants in Singapore. If you wish to have quality Italian food with quality Italian wines in a quiet setting then this should be high on your list. All the staff are knowledgeable and helpful yet humble. There are about 20 seats outdoors and many more inside. You can walk into the wine room and select your bottle(s). (When we were there last time a patron dropped one and the staff did not charge them.)There are too many dishes whose praises need to be called out so I shall only mention a few. The burrata (quite possibly the largest piece I have seen served) with Roma tomatoes; the antipasto misto; the linguine with langoustines; the grilled mackerel. We arrived late and hungry. Service was blindingly efficient and accurate. Suffice to say, after consuming the above and more, we did not try the desserts on this occasion.
5
I went with my girlfriend and another couple. The recommended goat cheese platter to start with was wonderful. And we have another appetiser. Later we had the pork collar stew an pizza which were equally delicious. We ended with sharing a tiramisu and a shot of limoncello. The thing is atmosphere was great, service was good, food was wonderful but came out not expensive. Hard to find nowadays in Singapore yet it stands isolated surrounded by trees
4
Visited this restaurant a couple of years ago - enjoyed it then and enjoyed this time as well. Main reason for going was the Burrata - it's wonderful. In general the main courses are good but don't quite match the excellent burrata. Decent wines at fairly reasonable prices (for Singapore). Pretty good service
3
There are many good and bad reviews here; the truth is somewhere in the middle.Good service, reasonable meal, excellent wines, ok atmosphere. Nothing to write home about. Not great, but certainly not poor.The burrata everyone raves about is just ok. Big lump of fresh burrata in one dish, plate of tomato and prosciutto on another. It works but isn't sophisticated and could be done at home. My swordfish was nicely cooked, meaty and not tough or dry as is so often the case. Osso bucco risotto ok but not memorable.Wine room to browse rather than a wine list is a nice idea.It was busy on Saturday night so suggest you make a booking
5
I attended a small birthday party in their private room which was fantastic, didn t know about this location before. So if you have up to 16 people they have a beautiful room with a small veranda included for pre cocktail drinks. The food was divine Italian food from the burrata, baked eggplant, salad and cold cuts to pasta and tenderloin with pine nuts. All was so delicious so happy to recommend them
5
We stumble this lovely restaurant by chance and we celebrate our 25th anniversary meal tonight. Greeted by polite phone reservation staff and even more polite staffs welcoming us when we are at the restaurant. We let the service staff to recommend the food and drink for the night. For starter, braccala, a salted cod fish which is unexpected a delight dish. We are served Tuscany speciality for the nite Lasagne Tordellate, another superb delicious food. We have Ham n Mushroom pizza, also fantastic. As my wife is a non-alcoholic drinker, the service staff recommend her a light Strawberry Cocktail of which my wife loves the drink so much. The staffs are very attentive throughout and today is Saturday nite! In conclusion, my wife and I have a wonderful meal in a wonderful restaurant and the price is reasonable for a five star service. Thank you so much and we will definitely come back and recommend to our friends as well
5
The food, the service and the ambiance is very Italian. The burrata is exquisite and enough for three adults. There are a few vegetarian options ... Well worth a visit even if slightly out of the way!
5
We had lunch there today and really enjoyed it. An unimpressive building but the food and service were outstanding . We would recommend and will return .
5
Nothing like a full restaurant with a great vibe. The menu is exceptional and the service is even better. There is something for everyone and a great wine selection to go with it. It has a great ambience and we were there for lunch. Make sure you book not to be disappointed. Enjoy
5
We stumbled on this lovely place & walked there. It appears out of nowhere in a lovely quiet area near Ayer Raja, but is buzzing when we arrive. We had a tour of their wine "cellar" which is more of a room with a small but excellent selection of wines. Food is truly delicious and authentic. Fresh tomatoes are a good test of quality in Singapore and they were juicy, bright red and vibrant with flavour. My Negroni was good, bitter & strong. The wine was excellent. Staff was knowledgeable and attentive but not hovering. A

It was full house on a Monday night so that was a good sign. However I was totally underwhelmed by the quality of food served. Appetizer if squid with vegetables was awful. Seafood pasta was not al dente and ingredients were miserly and did not taste fresh. Beef and pizza were average. Panna cotta dessert was the worst of the lot, so soft and creamy it fell through my fork. It's puzzling why the place has so many fans. The great ambience in a countryside setting may have something to do with it. Service was ok. Will not return for sure.

Pietrasanta continues to excel. A recent lunch, after a long time, brought sharp focus to what is really good about this homely Italian eatery. We started with some appetisers - fried cod ("Italian street food" - excellent) and their great home-made burrata cheese. Moving on to other appetisers and a great pasta with ground sausages, the whole meal was just excellent. Highly recommended
2
We have been going to this restaurant for a very long time and have been more than happy to go back repeatedly.Unfortunately, our recent visits over the last few months have left a great deal to be desired.On our last visit, we ordered something as simple as an aglio olio. Virtually impossible to mess up. Right? Wrong !!! As it so happens, there was so much salt chucked into the dish that it was inedible. Not just one, but FOUR plates of the same dish. We ended up going elsewhere for dinner.Barring their older staff, the quality of service has also suffered over the years.We will not be going back again. There are plenty of other establishments that do serve great Italian cuisine. This is not one of them
5
Three generations gathered for lunch and with high expectations for some Italian food.The expectations were met and then some. We had a variaty of dishes, but shared a specialty of the house for starters. The Burata -with tomatoes, Parma ham and rocket salad. Highly recommendable! Good for sharing.For main course one tried another house speciality - Tripa. The rest less adventurous of the family had pasta Frutti de Mare, Vongole), lamb shank or pizza. All was good.For dessert Tiramisu, Panna Cotta and different flavours of ice cream.All plates were empty by the end of the lunch :-) That speaks for itself!You can sit either inside or outside on the patio (out front or out back).Staff is very friendly and prices are reasonable
5
We were seated outside on the porch, and found it very nice, green and cozy. Great atmosphere. The staff was extremely attentive and would top up your water several times during the meal, and making sure you were alright and satisfied. Also happy to explain their dishes and specials of the day, along with any ingredients. Particularly the service was noteworthy. And to top it off - as expected from a good Italian restaurant - great food and wine. Highly recommended
5
Wessex Village is a great location in Singapore, with a rural feel near a residential area, with several great places to eat and get a drink.Pietrasanta is a wonderful restaurant with seating on a veranda at the front, inside and a lovely garden at the back. The food is fresh, tasty and of a consistently high quality. We had a couple of salads to start and loved the small plum tomatoes which we discovered were flown in from Italy three times a week (one thing that's hard to find in Singapore is decent tomatoes). The mains were equally good - we shared the cod as the salads were quite filling but everything we saw that had been ordered looked excellent.We would highly recommend Pietrasanta for the food, service, atmosphere and location
5
It's NOT just another Italian Restaurant in Singapore..this place offers a very authentic tuscan dining experience in a beautiful ambiance....The food is just awesome...a def recommendation.
4
Our first time here. Food is good and service is wonderful. Definitely will come back. Please make reservations. I had Vongole pasta and my son had a ribeye steak. Excellent cooking. Tiramisu for dessert is also great.
5
Consistently good, great service, delicious Italian food and good wine list. Always love this place for our Sunday lunch spot.

Party of 24 pax. Our usual year end gathering.
Served by wonderful staff led by Robin. Food was in abundance, and tasted lovely. Let the chef Loris select your food for you. You will not be disappointed.
An amazing wine selection too.

It was so impressive to have a dinner at Pietrasanta restaurant. We were treated with an excellent service and delicious dishes. Organic chicken , Burrata salad, duckDolceForte and cod fish and caramel semifreddo are highly recommended!
5
I recently went there to meet some friends and was pleasantly surprised. The location is lovely, the food fresh and delicious and the service and attention to detail outstanding. Will definitely go back. We had the burrata starter (strongly recommend) and I had the lasagna which was perfect. Its a little out of the normal locations but well worth it
5
My friends brought me here, a good Italian restaurant indeed. We ordered burrata chese w/ rocket salad dan parma ham. Oooh the burrata was amazing, fresh and creamy. Then we each ordered the main, mine was stewed rabbit leg. Honestly in my opinion, very unique unusual dishes, good quality and friendly service. Truly great experience
5
For me one of the best Italian restaurants in Singapore ! The food is excellent. My advice: absolutely do get a burrata as a starter to share, it is served with ham, salad and tomatoes, italian olive oil on the side. The raviolis are also deliciou
5
I went to have lunch here with my aunt last August. The place was so rural, it was nice and quite, far from the bustling city of Singapore. The bread was good, they keep refilling the bowl for my aunt and me :) If not mistaken I ordered the rocket salad and pasta with truffle for two people. And of course dessert to end the meal. I ordered the tiny chocolate and tiramisu for my aunt. We thought the portion was small, apparently it was huge. We were really full but it was great! The food and the ambience is great! People are very friendly and the guy who was serving was good looking. Service was great!Worth to try but maybe not when you are broke :

It's my husband's and my first time trying Pietrasanta. We've actually heard of the restaurant a couple of years back, but only tried it now cos we stay just 10 mins away :pAnyway...There are many reasons why we will be coming back for more. Firstly, the service is great. Everyone that served us was friendly, attentive, and took the effort to make us comfortable. Secondly, and more obviously, the food.For starters, we had the day's special - Burrata Cheese with Foccacia. The burrata was really fresh and delicious, albeit HUGE for two people. It looked like it was meant for 4 to 6 people to share. If you see the photo I'm sharing, that was just half of what was given to us. On a sidenote, I would really appreciate if the waiter gave us a heads up on the size of the burrata. We ordered the traditional Tuscan thick tomato soup as well. This was very good! The waiter was kind enough to separate it into two bowls for us. The portion was just nice for two people. I must say the tomatoes here are really exquisite. Now for pastas. My husband had the gnocchi with swordfish and capers while I had the fettucine with sausage and black truffle. Okay, so by now, we were actually slightly full from the HUGE burrata, so when it came to mains, we couldn't enjoy it as much as we wanted to. Don't get me wrong, the pasta were palatable as well, but now that we've learnt our lesson, we'd probably not get our stomachs so filled before having the pastas. We were too stuffed by now to have desserts, but we'll definitely come back again to try other items on the menu

Only for those willing to experience true tuscan cuisine. Be forewarned that you will never be able to go back to the garlic-filled Asian rendition of Italian food.
5
Pietrasanta in Singapore offers authentic italian food. The hightlight are the served Burrata and the wine cellar, but careful: expensive!
4
I've heard alot about this place that serves GREAT ITALIAN PIZZ& PASTA & had the final opportunity to get a last minute table after many past months attempts.
My family & I enjoyed the dinner & service - Pizza was super amazing & pasta fabulous.
4
My wife and I have visited Pietrasanta few times over the years and each of them were great. The recent visit in Nov was no different. They have a decent collection of wines at the cellar and the manager has a very good understanding on them. The white recommended to my wife based on her preference was awesome and the Toscana red I was recommended was fantastic as well.The buffalo mozzarella served with pama ham starter has always been good and many of the mains we've tried are good too. What makes this place special is the good service we get anytime we get there. Keep up the good work guys.
5
I joined a group of colleagues for dinner at this lovely Italian restaurant. The staff were welcoming and the food was excellent. We had a variety of appetizers and I enjoyed my pasta and beer. We were in quite a large group and there was no problem accommodating the size and the lively banter. Would definitely recommend this for family and friends
4
I was glad I booked because the restaurant was packed on a Monday evening. The food was excellent, good service and a nice choice of dishes. The waiter told us about the daily specials which was good. Definitely a place to go back to and lovely to sit outdoors
5
There are fancier places, but if you're looking for fresh, authentic Italian across the spectrum with a lively, friendly atmosphere then this is the place. Set in the leafy portsdown neighbourhood the 'out of town' vibe complements the light touch, personal service perfectly. Ask for the specials (though you won't have to), enjoy picking your own bottle of wine from the cellar
4
The food is really fabulous. right from the starters to the desserts. Its something that I have never tasted anyway else in Singapore. The Italian wines was a perfect compliment with the food especially the T bone steak and grilled potatoes. The dessert is really good too. The service is so friendly and patient. I just love the atmosphere of this place. I make it a point to go there once a month at least
3
We went for a group dinner - maybe this is why the service was so bad...waiters were clueless wrt toppling up water, providing enough salt and pepper cellars, oil bottles, etc we were 20 people and were given 1 pat of butter....Food was very nice: good appetisers, grab gnocchi was delicious, mains good. Dessert was disappointing.Location is not very convenient unless you have a car with gps ......
3
Both the tomato soup & the seafood soup are tasty but find the seafood one rather pricey. The freshly made focaccia bread is good. The cuttlefish antipasti is a bit salty. Overall the food is ok but not particularly impressive. It is relatively easy to book a table probably because of the location
5
A great restaurant. Love this place for our Sunday lunch. Food is great, wine selection is great and service is great. Thoroughly recommend this restaurant for any day or night of the week. 🍷🍷
5
Superb service - the staff is extremely friendly and knowledgeable about the menu, great food and the ambience is perfect. We had the burrata cheese and the truffle oil pizza. It was perfect.
5
Real italian taste in Singapore. This is a little piece of Italy in Singapore. If you live here or is passing by stop by PietraSanta for drinks and best Italian food in Asia.
4
Great Italian option away from the center, in a lush and cozy setting. Very diverse menu of Italian delicacies. The antipasti are outstanding (especially the burrata and the antipasto Toscano), great pasta (tagliatelle with salsiccia and truffle) and pizza as well.The tiramisu for dessert is average, I was surprised that they would fail on such a basic Italian dessert. Forgiven for this time as everything else was excellent as usual
5
Pietrasanta is known by many to be a cozy restaurant with an unpretentious menu made from fresh and quality produce. But above all that, (for me at least) what keeps me going back is their team of thoughtful staff. And after last night, I am thoroughly sold that the customer is at the heart of their service. Thank you Matnor for safe-keeping my wallet!
5
Very well hidden place, but it's a really good place to go to. There is a lot of space outside (where we ate) and it's very relaxing. The food arrived probably less than 15minutes after we ordered it, which is very fast. And it was good as well! The friendly staff were very helpful and dessert was also great. Finally a limoncello to round it off and then we were so full we couldn't eat anything anymore. It seemed very popular so a reservations seems needed. Will definitely go there again, it's really a good Italian place.

My son and I participated in this years OCBC Cycle 2015's 42km ride on 20 Aug and decided to give ourselves and the rest of the family a treat/reward for completing it. So we went searching for a nice Italian place and found this one. As with any first visit, we asked for the chef;s recommendations to try out what's good. We had the white clams (chef said that the clams were from Australia) in tomatoes sauce and bread for starts and appetizers. For the bread, we dipped it with the usual olive oil and also the tomato sauce from the clams dish as it made a good dip too. Then we had a salad followed by 3 pastas dishes which we shared all round - fettucini with crab meat, pasta with sausages (the sausages was de-skinned and the meat was fried with the pasta - I thought it was interesting to have minced meat fried with pasta - something that I told myself that I would like try to cook at home one day). The last item was a 12 inch pizza that had think slices of beef on it. There was 5 of us and everything and the quantity was just right for us. Truly a treat for the family and for my boy and I as both of us were work at 315am on Sunday morning to get ready for the race at 515am. After that we just rested for the rest of Sunday and caught up with some sleep and then had this nice family dinner.The service was good and the staff were very friendly. The place was quite popular and crowded and when we called the only available table was in the non-air-conditioned area and the time was 845pm.Portsdown is quite a hidden and inaccessible area but there are quite a few good eating places and we found this one. While we were there we also saw the well known "Coldbar" and the Temasek club which has some Chinese restaurants in them (my wife said she saw the name "Dragon Phoenix" which is a old established Cantonese restaurant name). This will definitely motivate me to train and ride harder on my road bike during the weekends in future so as to give me a reason to back to Portsdown again to try the good food here. :
4
My experience at Pietrasanta was great. The salads were fresh and the food fantastic too. The owner and staff were warm and friendly and I really enjoyed my meal. The pizzas were also yum and the mushroom risotto to die for. I highly recommend the place
5
My family's fav Italian restaurant snugged in quiet Portsdown Rd - warm & welcoming, wholesome & delicious - a truly great place to enjoy great Tuscan food. Did the drive & eat holiday in Tuscany last summer and Pietrasanta can stand shoulder to shoulder with the best ones there. Best burrata in town - huge, soft, super creamy, great parma ham, arugula and san marzano tomatoes to complement. Best parmagiana in my opinion. No fancy plating but honest good food to warm the tummy. Pastas are equally good while I had my usual anchovy & capers pizza - so very good. And do leave space for desserts - their tiramisu and creme brulee are highly recommended but try their house ice-cream and be pleasantly surprised. Very decent wine list. I'm so pleased that Chef Loris and his brother, Giuseppe, who manages the restaurant, have kept a consistently high standard over the years - long may Pietrasanta satisfy my Italian craving till my next trip to Italy..
5
we went with our friends for the firs time. Francesco was so helpful from the start and helped us a lot in ordering. also made tomato risotto specially for my wife. it is worth siting outside though inside is aircon. the food and service is outstanding. never eaten such good italian food in singapore. cheese was amazing. Thanks to Francesco who was so helpful and cheerful
1
We heard some good stuff about this place however were quite disappointed when we went there. The food is quite overpriced and the unfriendly staff have us a hard time enjoying our food... Overall we have to say. Noooooot good and definitely not again.
5
What's not to like about this fine Italian restaurant? The ambience is relaxing. The pasta is brilliant and they have Singapore's best pizzas. The wines, which you select from their cellar, are exemplary of the best wine growing regions in Italy. But, best of all, is the friendly, professional service which never wavers - no matter how busy they are. All in all, never fails to satisfy
4
Decided to write a review after two trips here. The first time was quite sometime back which left me craving for their food ever since. Went back again this June after a training at NTU alumni club due to proximity. Again, food was as good as how I remembered it to be if not better. It would have become one of my frequent favorites if not for the remote location. Service is hit and miss depending on who waits on your table. First time was not great but second time was much better. Won't be my last time here for sure.
4
Another hidden gem in a laid back black & white conservation house area, it is a lovely place for a quiet and relaxing meal away from the city. The food, dessert and extensive wine list is worth the long drive in, and returning for. Opt for an indoor table if you want to stay away from the mosquitoes
4
I have been dining here on and off over the last few years. The food is consistently good, atmosphere pleasant and the service staff attentive. The location is great , away from the maddening crowd. Reservations a must and it would be good to drive. It can be warm and humid if you want to dine outdoors
5
One place where good food is guaranteed (but not a table unless you book) is Pietrasanta. After a few visits, one becomes a "regular" and the service level goes up a notch. A good wine list too & with the option of dining indoors or outdoors, this is one of the best Italian restaurants to go to with family & friends. There is a party room / PDR too for larger groups but I haven't seen it yet. A must visit
2
Had dinner with my wife on Monday night. We were given a table which had water dripping on us. The antipasti and bread was served almost 1 hour after our order. Soup was so-so and the steak which was supposed to have 'some' marbling came with lumps of fats, definitely not the marbling which I'm more accustomed to. Overrated. Will not be returning to this plac
4
Had a great meal with top quality service. We made a last minute decision to try here and were rewarded with a two course meal that rivals most other Italians in Singapore. The wine we had recommended to us by the waiter was excellent. We will certainly return.
5
We love going to PietraSanta, especially if there is a group of us so we can share dishes. It has a lovely courtyard which is great for the kids to play in, the staff are always very personal and friendly, the wine is wonderful value (especially for Singapore!) and the food is delicious. Stand out dishes are the Burrata, sausage truffle pasta, lasagne layered with ham, cod and the dark chocolate torte
4
Quality food, and you pay for ambiance and service. All the mains are all right. The meats and seafood are good. A great way to eat is to pick a different main each and share. Service is good. Reservation is necessary as it is a popular place. They have indoor and outdoors seating. The place is sited a bit out of the way but servers can always call a taxi for you after the meal. A good way to experience eating away from the maddening crowd of the city center
5
Delicious food and lovely place to lunch. The burrata is amazing, Parma ham same level and crazy tomatoes!
1
I used to come to this restaurant quite often and I always enjoyed it. But recently during my past 3 visits the quality got much worse. The staff is very polite and the atmosphere is good... Overall I don't recommend this restaurant.
5
I was really surprised at the good quality of the food and the excellent service at this restaurant.
Recommended
5
Excellent food! Loris, who is the chef and part owner cooks up a delicious fare - a lot of it inspired by good old fashioned family traditions. Everything is fresh and seasonal. Love it there!
4
Serene and quite locality . Quality italian food served. You can ask for the special bread of the day which is fresh from the oven. Ample choices in vegetarian food. Have been there couple of times and have been never disappointed on quality and service.
4
This restaurant is tucked away in a pretty rustic part of the Portsdown area, not far from the Biopolis. We left the place totally satisfied on both occasions we were there. I love the Burrata which I would strongly recommend if you like mozzarella cheese and cream. The arugula and the fresh tomatoes that came with it were excellent combination when eaten with focaccia bread and extra virgin olive oil. If you tell your waiter you are going to share your courses, they would happily divide the portions for you. Though we had tried a few other dishes that were also good, the Burrata left a lasting memory
5
My favorite Italian restaurant. Located at ports down road which is like a village. Restaurant is run by 2 brothers from Italy. My favorite is squid ink spaghetti with pink crab meat sauce, pepperoni pizza, deep fried cheese and tiramisu. The free homemade bread is good too. Highly recommended.
4
I was here for lunch with 4 others - before I forget it is a la carte all the way here with NO set lunch. But they were still full house on this weekday. So, do expect S$80-100 per head if you have a starter, a NON pizza/pasta main and dessert, even for lunch.The service was attentive and excellent and we had no complaints. No issue with just tap rather than still/sparkling water. We ordered a few starters to share and they was all very nice. We then ordered 3 mains (2 pizzas and 1 pasta) for the 5 of us and note the pizzas were large ones that a person could not finish himself. Most of these were around $20 eac and they were all very good.We did not have dessert and got away with under $35 each
5
I should have written this review after the first visit and we have been going to Pietrasanta now for 2 years regularly. it is hands down one of the best Italian restaurants in Singapore. Everything about it, from the location, the decor, the friendliness or the staff, the impeccable service to the traditional cuisine with a home cooked taste, like they have cooked it especially for you, with prominent flavours and fresh ingredients. And of course not forgetting the wine cellar, where you can choose your own bottle of wine.I regularly have the Burrata to share, the Sausage Truffle pasta and the Amaretto with a jar of biscotti biscuits.You will not be disappointed
4
And the tastiest rib-eye in years, said 2 Venetians who live right on the Grand Canal, on a visit to Singapore.Also really delicious, black truffle pizza, burrata, pork cheek, ravioli, pasta aglio olio, trippa (tripe), parma ham pizza, porcini risotto....It was a cool evening and most pleasant and charming to sit in the garden. The interior was rather noisy
5
Came here to celebrate my daughter's birthday. Absolutely fantastic. The food is well prepared and presented. The service is impeccable. Highly recommended. Due to limited parking, you can get here by bus. 191 from the bus stop at The Metropolis (Buona Vista MRT Station). However the service stops at 20:00 hours. Take the bus there but for the return, launch Uber to get transport home
5
This is a place that never fails to disappoint. The atmosphere; the food; the cellar; the staff are just wonderful.To die for: Burrata cheese with fresh tomato and their fettuccine salsiccia e tartufo Nero (hand-made sausage; fettuccine and truffle sauce). Make sure you book a table
5
We have found Pietrasanta to be an excellent restaurant for the family, on special occasions. Away from tourist areas, and with easy parking, service is excellent and very friendly. The menu is extensive; preparation is timely; presentation is elegant; taste is great, and it is well priced
4
We had a very memorable and special celebratory dinner tonight at Pietrasanta. My dish was the grilled mackerel which was beyond expectations. It was big enough to be shared and sampled by the other four family members who all agreed it was well cooked and presented.The other four dishes and two starters did not disappoint and were savored by all of us. Thanks for the recommendation of the lamb shank which was substantial for my son in law who always has a ravenous appetite. The restaurant has a lovely homely vibe and casual chic ambience. The waiter who attended to us was very knowledgeable and efficient. Definitely will be back and will not hesitate to recommend the restaurant to friends and family.Promotional items will be well received as added options and make it more value for money
4
This restaurant serves really delicious Italian food. You have to try once if you've never been there before. Once is all you need to get hooked! The Vitello Tonnato with foccacia is a MUST order. The tuna is so tasty and highly addictive. It goes very well with the hot and crispy foccacia. If you are a seafood lover like me, you won't go wrong with the grilled calamari & baked cod fish. The calamari is cooked to perfection so it is tender and juicy. You can savor the freshness and sweetness from the cod fish. And if you love wine, they have loads for you to choose in their cellar. The downside of this place is its accessibility. You need to drive there. However, the ambiance and quality of foodis well worth it
5
You will find Pietrasanta well away from the tourist areas but it is certainly worth the detour. Booked the day before, we arrived on time and were welcomed by name! A good start! Both our first courses, Scamorza parma and Calamari salad were impressive; great ingredients carefully prepared and simply but elegantly served. Our mains, black ravioli gamberi and saffron risotto with marrow bone and a side of mushrooms were stunning. Of course a Moretti to start and two glasses of Ripasso (served from special fridge/serving unit which maintains the correct temp and uses argon or N2 to keep the opened bottles fresh) complimented the food. There is also a walk-in wine cellar with some very tempting wines. The attentive service & the opportunity to discuss our selections with the owner all added to the experience. We thought the prices were very reasonable for the quality and authenticity of the food. An excellent dining experience which we strongly recommend
5
We all felt a need for comfort food, so off we went to our favorite haunt in the Wessex Estate, Pietrasanta. The night was breezy so it was rather cool at our al fresco table. We had our usual buffalo mozarella with Parma ham, as well as the risotto with saffron and beef marrowbone which were brilliant. We also had their house specials of a perfectly medium rare beef tenderloin and the squid ink ravioli stuffed with ricotta cheese and diced shrimp. Both were simply delicious, especially when paired with the 2010 Umberto Cesari Reserve Sangiovese.Top it off with the very personalized service we have always enjoyed at Pietrasanta and it was the perfect night out!
5
I have been here twice and both times I was impressed by the service, particularly the head waiter, Geley (I think is her name). To date it's the best service I've had in Singapore. Food is very nice as well. If you like your wine, you'll enjoy the experience having to walk into the cellar to choose. Only downside is location. A bit awkward if you don't have a car. But still worth the visit or in my case revisits
5
Wow. What a weekend. Visited two venues on fri and sat for dinner and both were excellent in quality of food AND service. How offense does that happen in Singapore? Decent sized menu and very authentic food. Tried the pizza, burrata and steak with rucola salad. And panna cotta and tiramisu. Only suggestion was to leave the caramel out of the panna cotta as it was sweet enough. Good wine selection although a bit pricey. All in all, a fab venue for a dinner.
3
Came with friends on a quiet night for dinner. We had the burrata, the veggie pizza, insalata pecorino, and meat ravioli. The burrata was large and came with prosciutto, arugula, and tomatoes. I think we would all choose to order this again. I wasn't a fan of the pizza... Only a few very thin slices of veggies, too much cheese for my taste, and a bit lacking in sauce. The salad was also okay. I get upset when I don't get much of the actual lettuce, the point of a salad (in my opinion), and that's what happened here. But there were a fair amount of the other ingredients. I can't say how the ravioli was.On the other hand, many beautiful dishes passed our table throughout the meal, so I'm hoping I happened to make the wrong decision on my order.Well also received fresh focaccia and a tomato dipping sauce at the beginning of the meal.Prices seemed on par with serving sizes and quality of the product. Wine prices were average.Servers were unusually good for Singapore, very nice to see. Friendly, helpful, and a strong knowledge of the menu. The location and ambiance also deserve a positive note.Not sure if I would return though, considering my meal
2
Went for a family pizza dinner on Friday evening. Gave our order at 750pm and was not served food until 915pm. Really disappointed.
4
Great food although a bit pricey. No separate lunch menu but food quality and service is excellent.
Try the Buratta cheese with veggies.
Highly recommended.
5
Even though this place is a bit out from the city centre, well only a 20 min taxi ride it is worth a visit
The food is lovely and from the Tuscan region of Italy
They also have a fine collection of Italian wines
3
it was crowded for a weekday lunch, reservation is highly recommended. they have imported mozzarella every few days and it tasted terrific, rich, young! rocket salad, mussels, angel's hair pasta were satisfying good. nicely setup on the interior and exterior however noise level is quite high and parking is a problem with limited lots outside the restaurant
4
Had dinner with 10 friends at Pietrasanta. The service is excellent and the food all the way from the antipasta to the main course could not be faulted. The service staff made all the right recommendations. The Parma ham, deep fried red prawn, pasta with pork sausages tossed with truffle oil and their steak were all done to perfection. The wine off the month it's also exquisite, very seldom you can get good Italian wine at this price outside Italy. Only complain are the mossies and heat but that's because we choose to sit outside. Oh yea last but not least the dark chocolate dessert goes fantastically with an espresso or affogato :-
4
Hidden away from the hustle and bustle of the city, Pietrasanta makes for a perfect relaxed dinner spot. We started with the burrata and followed it with the squid ink ravioli and ossobuco, all of which were really great. The staff we very friendly and attentive, so overall we had a very pleasant evening out. We will surely be back and I would recommend it to anyone else looking for a good Italian
3
Used to be one of my favourite Italian restaurants in Singapore - but went there last week with my parents visiting from Italy and was incredibly disappointed. Prices have sky-rocketed, portions have shrunk and the quality is just average. Only the burrata was a great pleasure, but not much to cook there. I am sorry to say, but they won't see me for a very long time
5
I had diner there last night and I already can't wait to go back!The food, oh the food, is excellent!! I would highly recommend to share the Burrata cheese that comes with a plate of parma or prosciutto ham, rocket salad and cherry tomatoes. Best to also get the warm bred and olive oil that make a great combination all together!If you are not that hungry this might even be enough for two!But the pasta are really worth a try too! Between the 3 of us we tried 3 different pastas, the Gnocci gongorzola, the Spinach and ricotta raviolis and the prawns raviolis. They were all incredible!The restaurant itself is really nice and in a green and quiet environment. It's best to make a reservation and ask for a table outside, it will add to the experience in my opinion.It's not cheap but i don't find the food overpriced, especially for the quality! I mean you can spend the same amout of money in a very average restaurant anywhere in the city...Enjoy

We had made a telephone reservation followed by written email confirmation and took that much trouble as it was a special dinner for a friend and colleague who was retiring and this was bee favourite restaurant. The lost our reservation, stuck us outdoors with inadequate fan power. The wait staff had to be summoned to take orders, wouldn't do separate bills, wanted to move us half way through to make room for a second set of diners. The maÃ®tre d who had lost our reservation tried to be welcoming of our friend whom she recognized as did the owner when he came round. Too late to make anyone feel like a valued guest. Pastas were good. Pizza had too thick a crust. Cod fairly well cooked but skin flaccid not crisp. Desserts ok. Overall not a happy dining experience on this Friday night. The restaurant was full, can't think why.
4
This place meant a lot for me as it used to be my old dojo for the Judo club of Singapore. It's nice to see how they have made it up to be a restaurant but it does take me back. The place, food, service are all first class and I enjoyed the usual starters offered at an Italian restaurant. Main course was grilled Mackeral. All meals wonderfully presented.Location means you really have to drive here but it is a lovely place and there seems to be a lot happening for the area. If you happen to be working in Fusionopolis then I'm sure you will try this place out. It wont disappoint
5
Its tricky to find but the food is amazing and its definitely worth the drive. Best burrata I have had in a long long time.
4
This was our second visit and the place didn't disappoint. Not fancy but very good basic trattoria "terroir" food and friendly service plus a decent wine list. The florentine t-bone was grilled to perfection and the risotto/pasta were al dente with sauce that reminded me of grandma's cooking. The only disappointment was the pizza with crust that was too thick
5
I held my husbands birthday here and we had an amazing time. The pasta with sausages and truffle oil are amazing. Great wine selection. The chocolate tart that gets flown in from Italy is divine. But the best part is the Burrata cheese that is fresh and flown in from Italy
5
Great Italian food. I love Sunday lunch at this place. Sitting on the verandah getting served by great friendly staff no better way to eat good food and drink fine bottle of red from Guiseppe's cellar. It is also a great restaurant for dinner as well.
4
This is a wonderful restaurant where service is always prompt, efficient & friendly & food & wine always wonderful.One of the joys is being able to sit outside and enjoy fan assisted, covered gardens both front & back. The amazing thing is that only expats tend to enjoy this route with locals bizarrely preferring the freezing of the air conditioned inside even in colder rainy season. They don't know what they're missing!Choosing the wine is always an adventure as there us no list just a cellar!The range of traditional Italian food is extensive & perfect for every palate vegetarian & meat eater.Great for daytime & evening, friends, family & romantic dinners
5
Favoloso! That's how I would say. I just had lunch @ Pietrasanta this afternoon. A hidden gem to be. I have been stationed at Ayer Raja Camp back in the olden days but never once step near this restaurant (what am i missing!!). Anyway, the staffs are friendly and the food is fabulous. The ambience is charmingly great even during lunch. I would definitely come back again with my family and friends
3
The food was excellent but we have been disappointed by two things:The burrata was excellent but we asked for additional cherry tomatoes as the quantity was really not enough to share contrary to the waitress advice. They charged us 6 sgd for 6 cherry tomatoes!The dessert would not have been enough for a child. Very small portion of chocolat cake charged 14 sgd.Overall, the food was really excellent but the service need to improve as well as show more attention to the custome
5
i have visited Pietrasanta several time , being an italian expat in Singapore and naturally feeling mama and home sick by time to time as all the genuine italians :).i think Pietrasanta is among the very best italian restaurants in the country. I mean genuine italian taste!!i strongly reccomend the plac
2
To some extent and for a while, Pietrasanta was the Singapore's closest to real trattoria that reminds me of my succulent years in Venezia, Milano or Torino where you could enjoy la mamma menu's of the day for a few thousands Lira. Pietrasanta used to be a bit like this. Not bill wise, but day menu wise.I came back yesterday after almost a year. Well a disaster; no less.Giuseppe thinks of himself as a secret service operative. Speaks only&mysteriously in his earphone, but probably not to the Chef. That is for sure.Insipid Burrata, over cooked pasta, with mollified untasty crab meat. A quattro formagi pizza, no better than a Pizza Hut in quality, taste and presentation.One bottle only left in selection of Rosso di Montalcino. Other selection recommended over priced and of no interest. Where is the family, where is the cook, where are the ingredients? Until nobody gave you the answer and a proof of concept, avoid this place: it's drowning. Que miseria

Great Burrata, good selection of authentically prepared Italian food, nice atmosphere and good value.Choose from Pizza, home made fresh Pasta (excellent) or more extensive a La carte.The Spinach and ricotta ravilio was good, the steaks excellent Only disappointment was the quality of the Olive Oil - I expected a higher quality, richer Extra Virgine olive Oil than the one that was serve
4
The food is really good, especially the signature salad and squid ink pasta. Service was not so good. I think they were too busy!
Wine was nice and well priced. Definitely worth another visit!!
5
Never have been disappointed. Service very friendly and the food is delicious. Great wine list. Always love Sunday lunch here great Italian food

I was taken to lunch by a work colleague and thoroughly enjoyed this restaurant. Great service and food with attention to detail yet very authentic regional Italian food. All up a great experience, particularly when compared to the usual Singapore restaurants.

Good food, good menu, good service, nice atmosphere - & an even better experience as the boss was paying - not that expensive I guess but too much to go there every day just for lunch.

Of course I am bias, I was born in Tuscany just nearby the town of Pietrasanta! The Restaurant offers basically all the best traditional dishes of the Northern Tuscany area. Some of the dishes in the menu (tordelli di carne and testaroli) honestly reminded me of my grandmother best homemade treats! Is one of the few restaurant where I struggle to advice a specific dish ... because I would honestly order everything on the menu all over again (special mention to the Trippa!). Giuseppe is a great and serious host: service is always friendly and accurate without pretending to be too showy (it is an Italian Restaurant, not a French one!). Loris is an accurate and discrete chef. The 2 brother make a great team

This was my 2nd time visiting this restaurant. I took the waiters suggestion of the day's special. The burrata served with Parma, rockets & deliciously red tomatoes that were big & sweet. The burrata was made in-house & tasted fresh. It was served with focaccia that was fresh from the oven. I was so good that I might have over eaten. The tomato paste dip that is served usually with normal bread was appetizing.My partner had the Tordelli Di carne. The flavour was homey & comforting. I decided to get a pizza Diavola. But after seeing the pizza on someone else’s table, I knew that I would not be able to finish it. It was a thin crust 12 inch pizza. I ended up packing the whole thing for the next day.I also choose another special for my main – Beef cheek in red wine. But it didn’t come. There was some mix up despite me ordering it much earlier on. Nevertheless, it was a blessing in disguise as I was so full from the burrata.This meal included 2 beers & cost about S$160. It got a bit noisy after we arrive at about 7:30pm on a Thursday, when a group of about 20 that included 7 kids came in. The acoustics amplified the conversations of each table.My first visit was during a weekday for lunch. It was definitely quieter despite the fact that there were about 15 other patrons already there. The service was better in this visit. The grilled squid with rocket salad was good enough to tempt me to get more. The homemade squid ink ravioli filled with prawns in light tomato & lemon sauce was a good choice. For me, this was better than the Tordelli Di carne. The flavours were a bit more delicate. My friend had the Pizza with rocket salad & Parma ham & the lamb shank. The lamb shank was tender; the marrow was almost like mousse. A good choice if you are big eater. It was about S$104 for 2 persons. The servings here are good for sharing if you want to have variety. Will definitely recommend friends to come. Not so much suitable for private dates

I went to Pietrasanta with friends, one of which Italian, who did the chossing and the talking. And it was good! A variety of appetizer in real italian tradition, no signs of fusion, which is refreshing (fine meats, fried little fish, eggplants, veal masala, etc.. And the main dishes were delicious pastas, lambs meat, pizzas et all. Excellent wines, attentive service. Enjoyable and casual atmosphere with a quality kitchen. In your dish you will not find huge oversized portion as US italian has come to be, but just right sized to enjoy good quality, and to not regret that your blew your diet or daily needed calories. Pietrasanta is not located in a 'prime location' not on the big pasage trail of tourists, and you have to know it and go there

Not sure what the fuss is about. We'd booked a table but had to wait at least 20 minutes for them to clear and re-set in order to seat us; it took ages to be served water and bread, the waitress kept telling us different wines were available as the house wine which was very confusing; a number of menu items we wanted were out of stock - the waitress actually suggested that we should have pre-ordered our food when booking the table to secure our order?!?! Bizarre. Wouldn't bother - the food is reasonably good but not outstanding. They really need to sort out the number of waiting staff & ordering of their supplies

This was the second time to the restaurant, the first was a few years ago. Came here to celebrate my Dad's birthday, together with my family and my brother's family.The kids had pomodoro pasta, a penne and a spaghetti, and they both finished all of it (they only do that if the pasta is good). Also had the Margheritta pizza and my 5yr old son had 2 slices.Ordered the fried anchovies, grilled vegetables, burrata and grilled squid salad for starters. Grilled vegetables were nice but nothing special. Anchovies were fresh and nicely fried but again nothing special. But squid was very fresh and grilled just right, still slightly chewy. But the best was the burrata. Really good and fresh, and they served it with some special olive oil which really brought out the flavour.For mains, we had the grilled 1kg T-bone steak (Australian beef) done in the Tuscan style. Absolutely gorgeous. Medium rare but charred at the edges to give a very nice smoky taste and smell. The waiter (Mohd Noor?) was spot on with his recommendations (maybe that's why the other reviewer didn't order the right stuff by not following the recommendations). He also recommended the Fettuccine with sausages and truffles. Absolutely fantastic, haven't had truffles that were so flavourful outside of Tuscany. And the sauce was oh so rich. My sister-in-law ordered the lamb stew and my nephew ordered the osoboco. We also had the off-menu beef cheek which my dad and nephew said were very good (and my nephew's favourite choice, as he also the earlier 2 meat dishes). The only disappointment was my mum's aglio olio with prawns and squid, where the prawns had bicarbonate and I didn't like the "false" crunch.The waiter also recommended the 400g dark chocolate cake (we had the whole piece) as my dad's birthday cake, and also the semifreddo. Gorgeous. We tried the panna cotta too, not too bad and would have been good anywhere else but compared to the semifreddo and chocolate cake, it couldn't match up. And my family all thought the chocolate cake (imported from Florence) would be expensive and we all made a bet, going from $60 to $90, and I won when it came to $50 (not cheap but not too bad considering it came all the way from Italy). Capucinno could have been hotter, but this (and the aglio olio) were the only 2 "bad" points. Everything else was very good and we will definitely come back again.Cia

Like one other reviewer I honestly do not understand why this place gets decent reviews - do people have no taste buds. I went with the wife and 2 Italian friends last weekend, as the place had been recommended to us. It was a saturday night and was busy and we sat outside. The pace of service was extremely slow, except for the water which came every few minutes. It was about 40 minutes before they took our food order. They were on a robot program to try and sell the Ham and Burrata and other parts of the menu - we chose to ignore and went with our own options.None of the 4 starters or the mains we had were tasty. I had some kind of Beef broth with Ravioli soup which was not edible so I sent it back - was still charged for it though. Others had Lamb Shank and the pasta dishes for main course. All of us were deeply disappointed with the food. The portions were fairly small but were completely tasteless - like Micowave meals.The deserts were ok but overpriced. For instance the melting chocolate cake was recommended with ice-cream, and so they charged more for that making this desert $20..I can quite frankly say that this is by far the worst Italian I have been to in Singapore and none of us will be going back. It doesn't hold a candle to the best and more authentic places like Al Forno on the East Coast side. Please do not go and waste your money on this tasteless place. If you genuinely like Italian and have taste-buds! then go elsewher

Great food bread steak wine a bit noisy but I will be back in a nice shady place
Away from the money hungry Main Street
Never had bad service there

Food is fantastic! Nice wine cellar. Impeccable service and mostly the same staff for the last 4-5 years. Our favorite Italian restaurant in Singapore.
1
We tried this place a few times but the level of food and especially the service are much below expectations. The location is nice but remoute. the worth is the owner's attitude he is arrogant and rude.

I think Pietrasanta is an excellent restaurant cause they are quick, they are helpful and they are polite. My favorite dish is the spicy sausage pasta with truffle. It may be an expensive dish but its an excellent one. What I love about pietrasanta is that all the food is fresh and very tasty. One of my favorite place to eat my meal is at the back where all the kids can run around and have all the space they need and I love the swing set they set up in kids area. The other good thing is that while the adult are eating they can watch us at the same time cause we are very close. I go there occasionally with my family to have dinner. The only unpositive thing is that they can add some more kids deserts and more flavored ice-creams. By Rian (age 8

I'm perplexed by some of the recent good reviews here. This place was suggested by a work acquaintance and there were 30 of us so we had arranged a set menu. Starters were rocket leaves and tomatoes probably bought in a supermarket and thrown in a bowl, and a slice of bacon. Yuck. The next course was badly made pasta with tomato sauce and skinny underfed prawns. Yuck. My main course of lamb was raw. Yes raw, not even rare. Yuck yuck. Dessert was a cheap excuse of a lava cake which they called "melting cake". And these simple 4 courses took 3 hours to serve. my poor jetlagged american friends were falling asleep in between courses. And they have the nerve to charge us $100 per person, excluding wine. Who on earth comes here to eat. Yuck yuck yuc

I went here for Sunday evening dinner and drinks. The food and service were excellent, particularly the latter was notable for Singapore. There was no fuss about asking for extra bread or moving tables for dessert. We shared a pizza as an appetizer and then had the ravioli, which was excellent, although the portion was on the small side. As I was really hungry this was a bit of a problem. The house wine we had was very good and reasonably priced. All in all, it was a great dinner and ambiance and would recommend this place as a good homely option

Seems like most people in Singapore have never heard of it, which is funny because it has an excellent reputation. Anyway, I've now been twice, and they haven't missed a step yet. My Pizza as a starter and burrata were, well, perfect. Foccacia and salad that came along for the ride were good. Crab pasta was good. It's not really expensive. Wine list is small but adequate. Backyard dining was quirky, and hip, but the staff don't seem to come along often. It's a fairly large restaurant, but when I went on a Saturday night, it was jam-packed, so do make a reservation in advance

It is a special restaurant which you will be able to go there by car. The carpark at that area is free. It is not very convenience if you try to take public transport. I found this place very nice, cooling and romantic, not like what you always see in city area. It is more quiet place, which you can chit chat with your friends or partner over a cup of good wine. The food also taste good. It is just a bit more expensive than the usual restaurant that you always go
4
The food is amazing, and the service exemplary. The wines are a bit overpriced but most (including the house pours) are quite drinkable. We often go here for special occasions or when we have company in town and we need a night away from the other fantastic local cuisine we have in Singapore. One drawback is the availability of parking, but if you take a taxi you're set. Also, reservations are recommended
3
Judging by the number of customers at different times of visit, and given the inconvenient location, this place is overrated. It must be because it offers decent food at reasonable prices. The menu has all the Italian family classics - nothing fancy or particularly creative; the cooking is adequate, but not great. The servers compensate for their lack of competence with great enthusiasm (eg. recommending starters and second dishes which are remarkably similar to each other, etc). The lamb shank is gigantic and satisfying. At times, the pasta is overcooked
4
Good lunch menu with a variety of voices to suit all tastes. Good selection of wine. Prices a little high for lunch but we had a pleasant time all te same. Friendly staff and good atmosphere.
4
Location is a bit out there but, to be candid, I appreciated the quiet, wooded feel which is rare in Singapore. Cozy interior and the staff is well trained and very friendly. I had a minestrone appetizer which was VERY bland. The main pasta course more than made up for it as the pasta was cooked to perfection and the sausage/mushroom sauce was terrific. The tiramisu for dessert was also excellent as was the house pinot gringo wine, limoncello and espresso.All in all, in Singapore which has loads of Italian eateries at the top end, but very very few good ones, Pietrasanta is a great experience. I also appreciated the level of friendly attention (rather than merely asking if we wanted more) from the local staff and the well versed, Italian owne

If only Tripadvisor would allow 3 1/2 stars! Ate in September. Quiet, slightly difficult to get to restaurant located in the west side of Singapore, near the education/scientific area known as Biopolis. The restaurant is located in a verdant, leafy area redolent of the old colonial heydays of British rule, and you almost forget that you are in one of the most densely populated cities in SE Asia. Arrived on Friday evening and all indoor seats were long gone. Parking was difficult on Friday, having to park on the residential verges. We were greeted on arrival and shown to corner (outside) table. It wasn't particularly hot that night, but you might be troubled by the sound of passing traffic. We tried: antipasta (OK), cheese, black pig belly (nice, but rich), duck legs stewed in red wine and raisins (herby), osso bucco (hmm- OK, but was hoping for more subtle rich flavours), lamb shank (well, what can you say about lamb shank?). Dessert was shared tiramisu (nice!) and lime sorbet (exceedingly sour). Wines were expensive, even by Singapore standards, and the overall meal was slightly expensive for the food we received. Service was friendly and efficient, even though they did forget our second order of bread

If you are looking for fine cuisine, go elsewhereIf you are looking for a pleasant time, enjoy! The setting is nice if you are in the courtyard (no outside noise) . The food is simple but good except for deserts. Share a mozzarella di buffala, then have some pasta or a pizza...
2
The setting (ask for a table on the veranda or better still the courtyard at the back) was promising but the delivery was inconsistent and the staff...strange: equipped with walkie talkie earphones to relay orders to the kitchen and kitted out in maroon colour blazers they remind me of check in personnel of a budget airline, and they behaved just so - impersonal and diffident. The anitpasti were ok to good. Try the burratta if it's on and the focaccia bread. Run of the mill mains with defrosted boar sugo reminded of a ready meal. Pizza was ok and the house wine expensive for the quality...might return for antipasti and then leave. Ah! The coffee - a disgrace for an Italian restaurant! Vergogna

HAd lunch yesterday at Pietrasanta...this place never disappoints...great smooth service...they always accomodate my request for fresh anchovies which are not on the menu. Squid cooked perfectly as was the sea bream and osso bucco. FInished with their chocolate tart..excellent. premuim red house wine by the glass..all goo

If you want genuine Italian food in Singapore this is my favourite place to go. The owner and chef is from Tuscany and his brother is the maitre d'. The setting is lovely (for the moment, though threatened by the construction of the ugly Mediaopolis) and parking is free. I always sit on the front veranda, where I think they should make it a rule that the cars below park front in as the exhaust fumes of cars leaving are not nice sometimes. However, the food and the service more than make up for that. My absolute favourite starter is the burrata cheese with on-the- vine-straight-from-Italy tomatoes and Parma ham. I can't imagine why a previous reviewer was complaining about having to slice their own cheese. This is the delight. The burrata is soft and creamy and when you cut it open oozes a thick cream of buffalo mozarella from the centre. I would never allow anyone to cut my burrata!! The ravioli with sage sauce is my second favourite and, if I can manage it, the white chocolate cake with orange peel. . . The service here is impeccable – the staff are very well trained and very attentive, even when busy and hey, in a restaurant that is full most nights, you expect to wait a while but if you do you may be rewarded by great jokes from your waitress. I loved it when she announced “Beef cheek” as a daily special . . . “You can choose left or right cheek”. For a few seconds we all looked at her and one of us asked “Is there a difference?” LOL Where else would you ever get that kind of humour from a waitress in Singapore? I know there are other good Italian restaurants in Singapore but for me the location, ambience and service are a wonderful addition to fabulous food here

Went to this place with friends. Been there 1.5 yrs ago when it was still ok. The service, food and a complete dining experience took a huge plunge down from that time. What a disappointment...Reserved a day before and arrived on time. Waited 30 min to get the "reserved" table inside. Been seated outside to wait, and left there to rot... Staff buzzing around us like headless chicken and even after repeated requests not been able to pick the order up. Finally the first plates arrived app 30 min after order - antipasti... Mozzarella cheese (in bulk lump) and tomatoes on the plate. No olive oil, no nothing...Straight from the shopping bag onto the plate... Never seen anything like that served in an Italian restaurant... Not even in the food court. Took us few requests to get the semi-proper serving, with sliced mozzarella, sliced tomatoes and olive oil. Of course, service without a smile. And yes, paid 32.90++ for this "exquisite" dish. (Guess not worth to mention that it was a "special of the day" with no price indication either in the menu or by the staff. My mistake for expecting a standard antipasti price of 15-18++...)Waited another 45 min to get the main dish (total waiting time 1 hour 15 min from the time order taken!!). And this was on a weekday! Taste of pastas similar to frozen food from the supermarket. On the other hand, a price tag of a 5 star restaurant... Finally, the bill. Was expecting some kind of apology and significant discount. Wrong. No effort by the manager to try to make up for the disastrous experience... Got 10% discount (generous, right?) from him AFTER I asked for the discount. A fake smile of a 2nd hand car dealer and a robot-like behaviour of his staff helped making this dinner an experience to remember. They must be doing good if they don't care for small things like that... Waaay off the usual warmth you get in an Italian restaurant...Planning to go back again sometime around 12th of Never

We first visited Pietrasanta last september and forgot to write a review - so a chance to return with friends and see if the same excellent meal could be repeated was relished.Again, the welcome was warm and we were quickly seated and drinks ordered. We looked at sharing four courses, and starting with a fantastic creamy mozzarella - super. Follow that up with a spaghetti vongole and a shared (huge) t-bone grilled to perfection. A cheese selection finished the job.The wine list is actually a glass room where you can select the wine - with the help of Guiseppe - to match your food selection. Prices of the food are very reasonable - the wine is of course ranging in price - singapore is not the cheapest place in the world for good wine.Again, this is a fantastic restaurant and nice to get away from the CBD areas for a meal

Living in Asia it's nice to have some western food from time to time. For an Asian country this Italian restaurant offers good food. I loved the formarge quatro pizza. I totally enjoy quality cheese and it hit the spot for me. I over ate dam it! Excellent cheese and thick crust, if you like that. I had one coffee and enjoyed it so much ordered a second cup. Unfortunately a new staff member made the 2nd cup and it was bitter, burnt. I complained and lucky for me the waitress that I complained to was actually the one who made my 1st cup. She appologised and made me a fresh cup as good as the 1st and I was only billed for the 1st cup. Atmosphere- you can sit inside or on the front/side verandah over looking the road or out back. I like out back it's more plesant to me as I like the trees and outdoor feeling. You have a choice, depends on personal choice. I'm Australian so outdoors, trees, garden type setting brings me joy.
5
A really nice Italian restaurant - away from usual crowded locations so you need to drive. Worth searching out. They import quality food from Italy and particularly Tuscany. Pastas are home made on site and chef inventive. Rarely disappoints!
5
this is a place where you can really eat real Italian Style, no compromises, fresh mozzarella, burrata and great pastas made by chef Loris, superb wine list and ratio quality price excellent.
Little far from center but deserves a taxi ride.
Ciao Giuseppe and Loris

This is a one of our favourite restaurants in Singapore, and we always come back here for home-style Italian food. The brothers that own Pietrasanta started with a pizza joint in Holland Village and as their business grew, they moved to their current location at Portsdown Road. The service is warm and friendly and the food is 'mama-mia' delicious! We'll come here for their Vongole or seafood marinara, salds are refreshing and their desserts are yummy! The wines are reasonably priced and a good bottle of Prosecco [Italian bubbly] goes down really well. Indoor and outdoor seating; weekend dinner reservations are recommended.If you are thinking of a party with close friends, Pietrasanta will gladly help; they did with my wife's 3x-th birthday party!

A bit far from the center but a lovely place to go. Very warm, friendly and not posh at all. Service is excellent and food is fantastic. Price are reasonable. Good choice of wine, also by half bottle. My place when I feel homesick from europe..
3
Very popular with the expat community, Pietrasanta serves up good Italian food (for Singapore). The drinks are punishingly expensive and the house wine pours are so meagre you might as well just buy the bottle. The food does taste good, but it's more the feeling that it's a true Italian menu prepared by a real Italian Chef (who makes appearances to the delight of guests). That being said ... if you were recently in Europe and had good Italian food, you might wonder what all the fuss is about. Again...for Singapore, this is probably one of the nicest Italian restaurants. As for is it "real" Italian food?? Keep your expectations in check. Oh... and YES, it's expensive!!! (for Singapore
4
Spent much more money than I thought. The wine was great. Ambience fantastic.the food was another thing. The desserts were reasonable but the peperoni pizza was too spicy. And the ricotta spinach ravioli was all of 3 pieces and quite tasteless.we came back hungry, and nicely tipsy!! The waiting staff was very attentive and kept the water glasses full. Will recommend the place if you want a nice eve but aren't too hungr
5
Been to Pietrasanta so many time yet never got sick of it. Why? Because they never fail to impress my friends, family, spouse and I everytime with a great meal. The service is impeccable, the staff knows the menu on the back of their palm. The manager/owner Guiseppe is always present and takes time to chat with customers to ensure we had a great meal. He also is helpful in choosing wine eventhough the wine room is open for customers to browse and choose the wine of their choice. Totally unpretentious - we feel very at home and comfy having a meal at Pietrasanta! I forgot to mention that the head chef is the brother of Guiseppe [can't recall his name], they use their mom's recipe for some of the dishes as well. So you can't get anymore authentic than that. Must try - Entre: the clam in white wine and garlic, mozzarella with rocket and ham [off menu and seasonal]. Main: braise duck in red wine [my fav!], home-made ravioi with meat/sausage filing, oh... and pizzas are all delicious. Dessert: La Torta, Tiramisu and Torta di Mandole - must try! I have to stop now otherwise I might eat my keyboard... LOL!Time for another Italian fix at Pietrasanta. Don't let me tell you how good it is, just go try it out ya

We have frequented Pietrasanta since they opened some years ago and have never been disappointed. The location is quiet, off the beaten track and some people find it hard to find. Most enjoyable is the outside seating on the veranda. Don't expect posh interior, this is a place that is humble and simple and the money goes into the kitchen and service. Talking about service, this is the kind of experience I want, good and immediate service, not artificially and superficial but honest and straightforward. During dinner this particular evening we had various starters, with burrata, cold cut, fried squid (not battered), grilled veggies etc. It was followed by some risotto, parpadelle and crowned with ossobuco as a main course in my case. Desert was a delicious lime sorbet. Wine as usual very good and reasonably priced and the whole evening once more a fantastic gathering of colleagues, friends, with good food and wine in a comfortable atmosphere - thank you Pietrasanta

I took my wife recently for a romantic dinner and while the food was very good, the service and atmosphere were not quite what we had hoped for. I was very impressed with the walk in wine cooler and enjoyed choosing my wine straight from the cooler rather than from a menu. The food was also very good. What this place lacks is the "feeling" one hopes for in an Italian or any romantic restaurant. The servers were rushed, we never knew who was really taking care of our table so there was no personal connection to the server nor any desire to leave an extra tip at the end of the meal which we often do in Singapore for great service. The indoor seating provides little to no privacy. We will be back for the good food but not for that "special occasion" dinner
1
We went for a birthday dinner--heard it was great "real" Italian. More like eating in a busy LOUD train station where automatons rush around with wires coming out of their ears. I don't wonder the Italian owner couldn't make it back home.Food was ok (we really really tried to make it taste special), and the eggplant parm was good. But mushy baccalao with a sprig of thyme. Come on.The servers were so frantic, all I can say is sit outside and try for the second seating. Maybe things are pleasanter. They couldn't get us out of there fast enough

Good real Italian food, nice service, Italian owner, good wines and nice outside terrace with place for the children to run around

Fairy ordinary. Just lovely ambience and location
4
charming, cosy, casual place to hang out with friends for great pizza, pasta and wines.

Off the beaten track with a nice outdoor area. Pretty good food and wine list. Try their seafood pasta and parma ham...not bad at all.
4
Went for a team dinner and, to be honest, I was a little put off by the thought of heading out to Porrtsdown Road - 30+ minutes in a cab during rush hour. So I confess to having a negative mindset before even reaching the place...However, once entering the restaurant and taking in the atmosphere - and an Italian beer - my mood reversed. The restaurant was packed, not bad for an out of town spot on a monday night. The service was friendly and there seemed to be a good number of regulars getting the extra-friendly treatment you'd expect if you were such a customer. Welcoming to newcomers, friendly with regulars - I kinda like that, makes me want to go back.As we were a group, we kinda went for a bunch of mixed stuff. Good variety on the menu and the food kept coming. I specifically requested Bruschetta con Salsiccia Fresca (Freshly toasted Bread with home-made Pork Sausage Spicy Sauce) as it was something different, and it was a tasty treat, flavourful and unusual - served like mince rather than salami. Capaccio was good but needed a little seasoning. Two or three pizzas were thrown into the mix, good enough - I never get too excited about pizzas. Could have had a thinner, crispier - my preference - but they were ok. Stewed veal trip was on the menu for the more adventurous, but none of our group went down that route.There are a lot of the usual italian suspects on the menu (pizza, lasagne, gnocchi) but also a few unusual dishes (veal tripe, prawn ravioli, home-made Grilled Sausage served with saute Tuscan Black Cabbage). I went for a tuscan spaghetti (thicker than normal spaghetti) with wild boar sauce. Reckon I'd prefer normal spaghetti - or the wild boar stracci dish at OSO, but was nice to try something a little different. Had to add seasoning, but, that done, it was a tasty dish. A couple of the party went for Home-made Tuscan Spaghetti with Sausage and Truffle and that went down well, no complaints. One person went for some sort of seafood spaghetti dish which she felt was too overpowered by fish roe - the owner overheard the comment and immediately offered to replace the dish with something else, which I thought was a nice touch.Thrown into the middle of the table were a couple of large t-bone steaks. Very well cooked, well seasoned - delicious and ideal for sharing.Sadly no room for desserts, will save that for next timeOverall service was fine - some high spots such as the offer of a replacement dish. Glasses filled when required, menu questions answered - no problems.This restaurant isn't OSO, but I don;t think it tries to be. It offers good honest food in a bustling, friendly atmosphere. Only downside was the bathroom - needs a bit of renovation and was a bit close to the outside tables
4
The food here is above average and the staff are very accommodatingGiuseppe the owner is warm & friendly,always trying his best to seat you despite the restaurant being packed to the hilt especially during weekendsLocation is lovely,like a Relais & Chateaux property in Europ
3
We had pizza and a glass of house wine. The glass of wine cost $12 and the amount poured was an absolute insult. We're used to small pours in Singapore but this was extreme. In hindsight we should have sent it back. I know wine is expensive in this country but this was the worst we have come across and for this reason only we certainly would not return
4
This restuarant is a bit out of the way for most people, hidden on the scenic Portsdown road near the highway (AYE) exit. Your drive is totally worth it, especially great to unwind after a terrible work day, or have a lazy Sunday lunch with girlfriends.Ambience- quiet, with tinkling sounds of wine glasses and cutlery. This place offers both indoor and outdoor seating. Outdoor is in a verandah overlooking the parking lot which I prefer and the other is in the garden. I highly recommend a reservation. Wine list- encompassive but nothing out of this world, but bottles are reasonably priced.Food-This is what I go for and I am never disappointed. To start off with the Eggplant Parmigiana is just yummy, their Spinach Ravioli is to die for, the mushroom rissotto awesome. They offer a variety of pizzas but I am reluctant to give up on the starters and mains. My friends have tried the lamb, seafood pastas which they enjoyed. The best thing is a simple pommodoro sauce they serve with bread. I find that a signature touch and I have never had such fresh tasting tomato goodness in any other italian place in Singy. I also like the little dolci menu made out of wooden slats of empty wine boxes. To end a great meal, there is coffee and a nice variety of desserts-try the chocolate cake, there are 2 on the menu and I can never decide which one's better. Calories well spent!
5
i'm Italian and for me this is one of the few places i really enjoy to go, Pietrasanta is a small town in Tuscany region were food and wine enjoys the sun from morning to late noon, dishes are prepared in traditional way by Chef Loris and cold cuts and pastas are the really best you can find in town... ask for Picci with Lamb Ragout !!wine list is very exaustive and prices fair.i strongly recommend Pietrasant

We booked this restaurant for my birthday and what a disappointment. We were shown to a table outside (as requested when I rang to make the booking a week earlier). My surname had the number of the table written next to it on the reservations sheet. Then just as we were waiting for our starters we were told that we had to move tables to inside as this was no longer our table (?!) We said that were were fine where we were which annoyed the manager of the restaurant. Our food was then rushed out- starters and main course at the same time. Clearly the race was on to get us out of the restaurant asap in order to give our table to another customer! My starter, Melanzane Parmigiano was cold/frozen in the centre. Regardless, it was pretty hard to eat our food with both courses on the table. We then asked to see the desert menu and were told to go for some comfy seats for this - again we said we were ok where we were.. The manager by this point had had enough and proceeded to get another table and put it right next to us (there was not room). A few minutes later a couple were shown to the table and were really embarrassed about the close proximity. We decided not to order desert, we complained, the manager just shrugged, no apology - we will not be going back
