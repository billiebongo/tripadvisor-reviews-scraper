Service, cheese room, foie gras, freshness, quality and variety of the food : all was very much appreciated - as usual.
4
Spent the evenings surrounded by gentle atmosphere of great courtesy, feel Like home. Starters and cheese at full flow, waiter doscrete and helpful. Main course description not clear but final result was a succes.
4
Theyre currently running a cheese room promo along w antipasta. Burrata was glorious. Too bad for that pushy waitress who kept trying to make us get the main courses despite us saying we werent hungry. Otherwise great option
4
Good Italian food with some authentic Italian meals,which are prepared very well.On par with restaurants in Italy.Service was top notch,really made us feel comfortable.Try sea bass.
5
My 5th visits to Basilico. Has always been my favourite Italian restaurant in Singapore. As usual, a great dinner and service from the restaurant.
4
Since I came to Singapore and discovered Basilico this became a classic.. Great Buffet, excellent choice of Italian dishes, cheese and appetizers. Suggested!
5
If you love Italian food you have to go & check out the Lunch all-you-can-eat Buffet at Basilico Restaurant. There is wide range of different antipasties, salads, cheese and cold cuts followed by a warm buffet (different pastas and pizza, meats etc). Try to save some space for the dessert buffet which is also absolutely amazing! Try to schedule in a nap after lunch ... you will need it :-

I have a soft corner for buffets, it gives a good reflection on how well a kitchen is capable of cooking in mass with quality. Basilico delivered in spades. It has a lovely combination of Italian antipasti and Asian fusion cuisine on offer. The cold cuts, the array of cheeses and salads make up a fascinating start for this gastronomical experience. The mains are equally delicious with; grilled salmon, lamb leg, medium rare steaks and a lasagne that’s truly to die for. In terms of ambiance, Basilico embraces the luxury of the Regent Hotel and the service is par excellence. The restaurant itself is beautifully designed and spacious and non intrusive among the guests. Do make a reservation, as this place cannot accommodate walk ins. A must try!

I’ve been to Basilico more times than I can remember, and there are two main reasons why I keep coming back. 1. Unparalleled service Yes, the food is good, but the service is simply unrivalled. The staff go to great lengths to ensure an exceptional dining experience — they always remember my name, seat me at my favorite table, and are exceedingly friendly and polite. I’ve celebrated several special occasions here and liaised with staff beforehand to plan surprises for members of my dining party, which have always been a resonating success. 2. Amazing semi-buffet spreadI’m a big fan of the antipasti/dessert semi-buffet option — the savoury selection of cured meats, cheeses, salads, and Italian breads is enough to fill me up, without having to order a main course! The desserts are also some of the best I’ve had in Singapore. My favorite has to be the warm apple crumble and the bread pudding. The homemade Italian gelato is quite something too. I don’t usually like sorbet, but the ones here are delicious... and the rest of the gelato is really good too. Kudos to the pastry and dessert team! I’ve tried some of the main courses before and while delicious, I think you can find better Italian food elsewhere. The grilled meats could be better seasoned, and I had a gnocchi dish yesterday as part of the “Formagissimo” promotion that left my palate somewhat confused — the gnocchi seemed to be deep-fried and was gummy when I bit into it. That being said, Basilico does do an amazing oven-baked focaccia with truffle and cheese. It is beyond delicious. Order it. All in all, Basilico is a lovely place to dine and I always enjoy myself thoroughly whenever I visit. The warm hospitality always makes me feel at home

Had a variety of cheese, lobster and crayfish for my visit. Only issue was i indicated birthday celebration for my fiancee, but did not get a small cake for her, while the other table has a mini cake. Other than that, everything was perfect and i had a complimentary parking coupon for my car as well
4
Great food, friendly staff, but service was a little slow. Visited the restaurant on a friday night so that could have played a role.
5
Chef Luca is one of the best in the industry and so kind and caring to our family. We enjoy seeing him each time we go to visit. The food is great: fresh, good selection, fun.
4
Had my birthday celebrated there and enjoyed the pizza, wine and desserts too, yet to try their buffet thou but it seems like they have a wide range of cheese and ham.
5
Went for the menu with the cheese room special for the month. We have always loved the antipasti stations but the cheese room with great quality cheeses just made our night super awesome.
5
Back at Basilico (our favourite in Singapore) and the normal excellent antipasti buffet selection of artisan cold meats, tomatoes and cheeses. The extra dishes from the Chef were superb, particularly the Mozzerella focaccia toastie! Awesome!
4
Good spread of Italian food. Quality of food, friendly and prompt service and variety of food choices.
3
The restaurant design is quite sophisticated although there are different dining areas which makes it disconnected... the service is friendly and good food is good, but it is a lonely restaurant with no music or realAmbience. The hotel lobby is an atrium but nothing happening so it is a large empty space. I would not come back again although the food is okay... just a boring place to be..

I am a fan of Italian food, and maybe that's why I came to Basilico with very high expectation to relive moments i had in Milano, Bologna and Parma where i had one of the best pasta, parma ham and seafood dishes in my life. For buffet lunch at $62++, i didn't see any parmigiano reggiano, crayfish, small lobsters, fresh prawns, Sashimi or oysters you will get from the normal buffets in other restaurant at the same pricing, for example at claymore 10Vegetables are of normal quality. At least for the missing seafood, I was expect to have air-flown radish, zucchini and asparagus that are very sweet and crispy. Sad to say, thou there are green asparagus and zucchini, they are of average supermarket quality. I guess it will be a one time experience for meHowever if you are really keen to try Basilico, i will suggest you should focus on their roasted chicken, grilled fish with dill sauce, Pasta in Gorgonzola cheese with truffle oil, Salami with honey, and maybe some rock melon (i won't call it muskmelon as it's not sweet enough) with slices of parma ham. Avoid their beef and mutton at all costs, as it's tougher than the leather chairDessert wise just panna cotta with blue berry and maybe the chocolate cake as they use the chocolate bars from Italy. The others are just average, some are too sweet which i got sick after the second bite.Oh i almost missed the bread, which is quite good and soft. But not for 62 dollars
4
Had a New Years Day dinner, the food was of a high standard, the truffle pasta was very good. Good Parma ham, average Burrata. I wanted to give a five rating, however there’s something missing from the experience. I thinks it’s the optional “buffet” offering for starters and deserts, it gives the restaurant a Vegas style ambiance at times. Not a good fit for the quality of food and wine on offer at the price point.
5
I have never seen such a large choice of Italian cheeses. All kind of mozzarella, burata (my favorite), pecorino, gorgonzola, etc... Amazing!All these cheeses served with delicious Italian tomatoes, the real ones with taste (!!!), Parma ham and lots of cold cuts.The seafood buffet was also excellent with lobster, crayfish, crabs, scallops, shrimps, etcAnd finally a delicious black truffle risotto and fresh pasta.To be honest, I cannot tell you all the rest of the buffet, as I only focused on the cheese section!!!!
3
I have not had buffet at Basilico, that I have heard is nice. I have been here for dinners couple of times. The ala carte menu for vegetarians is limited. The classic Italian dishes, e.g. mushroom risotto or a tomator-mozzarella salad, are very ordinary,
4
Nice ambience, the service is good, we ordered the semi buffet, main course was great but the appetiser and dessert was average with limited choice. No fruits.
5
Excellent Italian food restaurant in the centre of Singapore. One of the best meal of my trip .will back
4
Had our annual company dinner here.
Good food, generous and well laid out starter buffet followed by great main courses.
Excellent choice of dessert buffet.
Attentive and friendly service right thru the 3 hour dinner - kudos to Sherwin and Boris
4
I would suggest two improvements.One is to offer an espresso instead of a regular coffee after lunch. The second is to review the selection of dessert. They have morphed too much into the asian taste, and the only Italian thing that left is probably their name.
4
Spent Valentine’s Day with my husband here. We’ve been here a couple of times already and each visit has always been great. We love the concept of the semi-buffet with great appetizers and desserts. This is truly a Great place to wine & dine with a loved one. Highly recommended!

Other than Ritz Carlton's Colony I was rather unimpressed with Singapore's hotel buffets in general. This changed when I visited Basilico on a Sunday for its brunch. While it costed a hefty $110++ per person, the food in my opinion makes up for the price tag. Service was immaculate upon arrival, with the waiter taking a little time out to show us and introduce us to the various food areas before bringing us to our table and explaining the array of drinks on offer. Basilico offers an all-Italian variety of food, hence you will not find Japanese sashimi/sushi and typical Asian hot food served in other hotel buffets here. Instead, you get a wide variety of antipasti and seafood including deliciously sweet crayfish and lobsters. The restaurant also had a separate cheese room which has an incredulous number of cheese on display. Halfway through the meal, one of the waiters who cleared my plate asked if I had enough space in my stomach for desserts, as he shared that their desserts were REALLY good. The desserts comprised cakes, creme brulee, panna cotta and gelato, but the tiramisu and pistachio raspberry cake left a deep impression in particular. So smooth and delicious.Guests could also consume the fruits on display - in whole and uncut!While the hot food selection was somewhat limited, I still appreciated that some of the hot food were different - such as focaccia mascarpone, truffle risotto (which was fantastic btw), tagliatelle alla bolognese.Overall, the food was great and service was impeccable, with waiters clearing out plates at efficient rates and constantly checking in with us to ensure we were fine with the food. Perhaps the only cons would be the limited hot food selection and hefty price tag
3
The location is amazing, high class, placed into the Four Season Regent Hotel in Singapore. I have been in Basilico twice, I have tried buffet but also "a la carte" Menu. The buffet is assorted and rich with many cold cuts and cheeses, excellent. However the Menu "a la carte" is not that rich of dishes, only few type of pasta. Orecchiette al pomodoro and the tagliatelle alla bolognese were really below average resulting unsatisfactory. Ok the wine list . Generally Disappointed. Price are in line with Singapore market
5
It is my second time visit the restaurant and first time visit during dinner time. The semi buffet has a great selection of cold cuts and antipasti, however, I would really appreciate it if the restaurant can serve more selection of soft cheese. In terms of service, Ms. Jane showed great passion in providing excellent service and attentive attitude even during rushing hours. In addition, engaging the guests. Special thanks to her.
5
Went there with family for my sister's birthday dinner and Basilico delivered! Ordered 2 each from their selection of pizzas , pastas , sides and dessert all of which tasted great. The truffle mushroom risotto was a unanimous Favourite dish of the table, probably the best risotto I've ever tasted in Singapore .Special mention to Rishni who attended to us for whom everything was possible (table had a lot of funny requests) and everything was done with a smile.Overall a great experience , will definitely come back for mor
5
We had anniversary and the way we were treated by the people in the restaurant was so nice. I will definitely become regular to this place.
5
Take your time to saviour the fabulous food, enjoy the laid back atmosphere and the attentiveness of the waiters.
5
We celebrated our son’s birthday. The ambience is good. The right place for celebration with soft lighting and good food, right from starters to dessert . The staff is attentive with excellent service.
5
A group of us enjoyed our dinner with attentive wait staff. The restaurant was flexible in replacing my lamb rump with lamp chops (the chops were delicious!) too. Will come back again!
5
This place comes through once again. We come here pretty often and it is simply amazing every time!! Great selection of hot and cold food ... topped off with perfect deserts. A must go Italian restaurant.
3
Range not as wide or as premium as the hotel's own. The food tastes decent, but nothing in particular would inspire me to make a trip down or pay for it if it weren't bundled with the room package

We were staying at the Regent and wanted to celebrate our Anniversary in style. With So much to choose from in Singapore, we decided to go with the most obvious choice, the restaurant in the hotel that had a lot of positive reviews. The Hostess, whose name we regretfully did not catch was really exceptional. Our Waiter, Malcolm tried hard. There was a decent antipasto/salad bar, nothing extravagant. They slice up the meats and leave them in platters to self serve. But they didn't slice enough of prosciutto and some other meat. No big issue. The chef came out and he was really apologetic. Our main course however. We waited for that for a long time. Really long. Malcolm had to apologize numerous times for the lengthy wait, even though we didn't really complain or mention it to him. Then some manager or assistant manager came out to apologize and to him though I did mention that our wait has been quite lengthy, to which he acknowledged and apologized. But that was pretty much it. By the time our meal arrived which did look very appetizing and was not bad, but at that point our mood was off. The hostess came by with a cake since it was our Anniversary. I am sure that they have provided amazing service to most of their patrons, but we didn't receive it. And yes we did receive apologies, but big deal. A damper had been put on our evening and even though I will make an effort to stay at the Regent again, I would definitely give second thoughts before I dine at the Basilico again. Sorry
4
Went on restaurant reviews and enjoyed a great meal. We were seated and served promptly to our choice of location. The restaurant wasn't too busy and had a good feel to it.The chef's specials were recommended and we are one of these (squid) as a shared starter with garlic bread. For the main course I chose sea fish, pickle and rock fish caviar tagliatelle (the other of the two specials) and my daughter are cows cheek with mashed potatoes. Both dishes were tasty, succulent and well portioned. I wasn't as impressed with the house white wine but that was my choice.I would certainly go again
5
My daughter and friends enjoyed the dinner very much while they were there 2weeks ago.I just reserved the room for 10people and the restaurant did the rest!! I was in tokyo while she had a great celebration there. Was told food was great and the chef made a point to say hello.Thank you to all who have served on that night. :
5
Celebrated my friend's birthday at the restaurant and before the dinner we had a had a couple of email correspondence and the team was always prompt and very professional, made me look forward to the dinner every single time! We were led to our table in a cosy corner with the pool view, upon seated, we were offered the food and wine menus and water. Service was prompt and it seems like all the service staff knew exactly what comes next and entire flow was so smooth. The young indian male staff was eloquent in describing the vintage of the wine to us, and professional in serving wine. The manager/ host, who walked us to the table, knew we were first timer introduced the menu to us patiently and enthusiastically. Mid way thru the dinner, we received our main course but my friend realised she made a wrong decision, but the wait staff (the indian gentleman) asked if everything was ok, and when we told him that, he immediately offered to change a dish for us which I was very very impressed with, even though working in a luxury hotel myself! It just shows the staff are empowered to make justified decisions and that makes a great place to work in and instil loyalty and sense of belonging which i can see in every staff! They showed it through their enthusiasm, especially the korean girl who spoke japanese, she was so friendly and chatty which made the mood even better! Her smile was so sweet it enhanced the dessert time sweetness! It was a great evening, awesome food, exceptional service and now I am a fan of Basilico! However, would hope to see more italian food being brought to the menu, like florencia steak (which i'm still dreaming of since the first time i ate in Florence) and the authentic italian carbonara which was not in the menu. Once again, thank you for everything! Hope to be back soon
4
Food was good. For the price I would have expected a bigger variety and spread though. I will go back for the ice cream, my Husband likes the Parma ham
5
Having lunch with few friends there, had very good time and really enjoy atmosphere in restaurant. Good service from staff, very friendly and helpful.. Blow away with service from montecarlo and lailanie from this restaurant. Definitely will visit again.
5
The menu was easy to follow with various price options. It's simply Italian at its best with the fine spread of antipasti, great main course choices and yes the desserts are not to be missed.
5
Visiting last Saturday to celebrates my brothers 50th birthday. wow the place is fantastic. Food selection and quality is what you'd expect from a 5 star hotel. Excellent value for money. Couldn't fault the experience.
5
We dined in the restaurant for breakfast each day and the buffet was always high calibre, freshly cooked omelettes and very varied fruit and cheese options.
3
The vegetarian tortellini was so dry, they could have made the creamy slightly runny so that it wouldn’t end up as blobs on the spoon. We had friends from overseas and we were so caught up in talking that we didn’t realize time, the waiter didn’t even have the curtesy to let us know if we had any last orders. Instead when we tried to order dessert, he simply told us kitchen had closed. Such a shame as we had wanted to try the dessert. The service could have been improved in that sense.
5
We were at Basilico for Sunday brunch and while the spread isn’t as lavish or extensive as other places in Singapore, absolutely everything they served was top notch quality and well-done. If you like Italian, seafood, grilled meat, pasta, cheese, charcuterie then would highly recommend this brunch. Service is attentive and generous. Please note there are no cocktail options included in the brunch offer just prosecco, red and white wine. If you need cocktails that will be an additional cost.
5
An "Outstanding" review coming from a New Haven ethnic Italian is quite a compliment.My focus on Trip Advisor is to review restaurants that I think travelers like us will enjoy, not only for the food but other reasons such as service, humor and ambiance.Basilico is in Singapore a special restaurant as I stated in the header. Because in an Italian restaurant food is at the top of the list, I will begin there. Just an outline not every item on the menu. Every restaurant is measured by a simple item -THE BREAD- . Basilico hits the mark with their bread from focaccia to olive bread to simple sliced bread each type is fresh tasty and abundant. To Italian eaters good bread defines a restaurant. In this case the baker should be proud.Although the restaurant is billed as Italian, which it is, there are Asian diners which must be served. The menu is varied to include a number of items to to serve all tastes. The dinner buffet , a main course may also be ordered, is huge and varied. Of course we went for the Italian selections which included freshly sliced Parma ham.The main courses my wife and I enjoyed were Pear Stuffed Ravoli in the shape of purses and oven roasted Branzino with clams in broth. Simply delicious.To add to the dining experience is the mostly Asian wait staff that have Italian hearts. They are friendly, have humor ollland most importantly know the food. Complements to the chief.We made Basilico our go-to restaurant. Eating breakfast there every day and dining there several times to the point that when at other restaurants we were wishing we stayed "home" at the Regent and dined at Basilico rather than being in stainless steel towers with over-rated, over - advertised seafood buffets where you are told you have to leave at a certain time or they take the food away ( across the street).Recommendation GO-- as often as possible!! They also have a top rated Chinese Restaurant
4
The prices steadily rise, but I can't blame them as they take care of their quality and are therefore very popular. When I dined, the non-alcohol brunch per pax was $105++.I like that they have moved the burrata into the cheese room. The many choices of burrata are awesome. However I didn't see the cheese wheel risotto this time. Pls bring that back
5
I don't remember over the last 28 years of my business travels, I have even had a breakfast like this.Nothing was wrong...and I mean it...nothingReception at the restaurant was so warm, friendly, with unique positive energy, speedy seating.Any type of food you can or can't imagine is there.Best ever cook, artful and loads of talent behindNever miss your breakfast there when you are in Singapore. Period
5
The buffet selection were varied with many selection of cold cuts, cheeses and desserts. More than sufficient without the mains which you have a choice to omit.
4
Great starters and sweets - high quality meats and cheeses and cakes, extensive selection. If only you could skip the mains!
5
Went there on ladies' night with a friend. The buffet was just stunning - everything from salad to cheese to dessert tasted absolutely fabulous. The free flow prosecco was really good as well. A great night out.
5
The food was great as usual, the service staff were very attentive and friendly, will always check on the table if we need any thing else. Overall great experience.
5
The service was impressive. I just mentioned in passing that I was there to celebrate a Birthday, and didnt even arrange anything further. But the servers at the end of the meal, brought a slice of cake, which was very good service to say the least.
5
I would like to thank the exceptional staff at Basilico today.In particular, I would like to commend your manager Montecarlo for his impeccable service and going above and beyond.I was also very impressed when he observed me giving a present to my companion and hence inquired if we were celebrating a birthday.The food was wonderful, but your staff made this an unforgettable day for us.Will definitely return and recommend
3
Maybe since I went to very high expectations, I felt that the food and service was not quite up to what I had expected.I enjoyed the cheese selection, but didn't find anything else impressive - in addition, the servers were very slow to serve us.
5
We enjoyed our second time for Sunday brunch to celebrate a special occasion. The seafood was Super fresh. The Alaskan crab legs were sweet and meaty. Prawns, lobster, crayfish and mussels were succulent and perfect as the appetiser. Of course after 2 rounds, I had to try the other equally outstanding dishes like the Wagyu lasagna, the lamb shank, steak, Foie Gras and the rack of lamb. The cheese room was another level up experience with a full range of cheese delights! And of course the dessert was special. The Apple pie with ice cream is my favourite!!!And

Already revised this as part of the hotel review.the one disappointment of the hotel. The food (when it arrived) was delicious but the service was awful.Adults meals arrived but no kids meals. After 5 full minutes waiting we ask where the kids food is. Literally 10 minutes later the kids food finally came out (by that stage the kids had eaten my wife's entire meal). Still no side salad which was supposed to arrive with the adult main meals. Another few minutes and the side salad arrives (I have already finished my meal at this stage).They agreed to replace my wife's main meal but a full 30 minutes later it still had not arrived (grilled salmon - takes a maximum of 6 minutes to cook). Had to ask again for the food mind you.At the end no visit from management, no offer to reduce the bill, a 'very sorry' from the waitress. Paid 5 star prices for 3 star service. Won't rush back there

Basilico is one of the restaurants available at the Regent Hotel, which is still part of the Four Seasons group. With Headchef Luca Beccali at the helm and a team of staff with great personalities, Basilico is a perfect place to enjoy delicious and fresh Italian buffet.When we think Italian, we will straight away think about the fresh produce that available in the country. Starting from seafood, meat, delicious cheese, salad, tomatoes and also olives. Basilico definitely tried to provide all those for their customers, including the remarkable list of Italian wine. Some the wines are also available by the glass.We were impressed with the food presentation especially when we saw the big island set up in the middle of the room. I walked around to see different types of cheese from soft burrata, to freshly aged asiago. Each cheese on display has the name, place of origin and information on which animal it came from. It was impressive, and I wish I weren't bound by time so I could try each cheese on display.Of course when we think cheese we will also consider the cold meat that we need. I stopped counting the amount of prosciutto and salami that I took. I wrapped some prosciutto on olives, mixed it with burrata and Roma tomatoes, as well as sweet cantaloupe. Moving on to seafood, even though there wasn't any Mediterranean water nearby, the quality of seafood at Basilico was really fresh. They have plenty of salad that can be mixed together with slices of tuna, salmon, and even lobster. I included some house-made bread and dips to complete the mini feast.Basilico also offers main dishes to complement your buffet. That night we tried the famous cheesy truffle foccacia, called 'Foccacina con Tartufo Nero e Robiola' in the menu. The well-flavoured foccacia was made in-house and served with generous amount of black truffle. I crushed the black truffle and spread it all over the surface of foccacia.Another dish that we enjoyed in the group is the Pentolone di Carne. It was served in a big pot and smoked with pizza dough on top. Underneath, there were tender lamb chop, pork sausages, grilled beef tenderloin, and some vegetables. This was only available until the 25th of September as part of Basilissimo Flavour of Autumn, so we were lucky that we were there to try it.Basilico also has its own dessert counter with gelati and beautiful house-made cakes. I was thankful that each cake was in a perfect bite size. I tried the Pistachio Cherry Mascarpone Mousse cake, Chocolate Mille Feuille with cute layers, Maple Hazelnut Financier and a small jar of Tiramisu (yas!).Basilico was chosen as one of the top restaurants in Singapore's Top Tables. We really loved the hospitality of each staff, the presentation of their buffet spread and the quality of each ingredient
5
Excellent standards and variety as per usual standards. From cheeses, to starters to mains to desserts.
5
Delicious!!! The food and the drinks. Worth every penny... the variety of antipasti, cheeses, pasta, meats and desserts are to die for. A wonderful day bonding over food and wine on our trip to Singapore. Will go again next time for sure!
5
Choice of food, the quality of the food and the spread available was excellent. Service was also very good. Certainly worth the money.
5
My fiancee and I celebrated our anniversary here and we were blown away by the spread of food, the service and the ambience. We loved the Alaskan King crab w scallops in particular.
5
Great concept, very good service and very good food. Take wel for the details and did not forget the birthday of our friend.
5
Good service and atmosphere there. Worth going if you are a fan of cheese and foie gras! There are many differenet types of cheese and the pasta was really tasty!
3
We stayed at Regent for several days, and were extremely excited to have a high-rated restaurant on site. The decision for one night dinner of our trip, was extremely easy, just going downstairs and enjoy. There was a half buffet, mainly with cold selection of dishes, which we rejected immediately. It's extremely hard to keep good standards on buffets, so we prefer a la carte. The food was good, very good actually. The ambiance enjoyable. The problem was the service and that's what made me review as average. For the price paid, the kind of restaurant and the high quality on meals, one would expect that the service is up to that level. Believe me, it wasn't. Very distracted, absent, no recommendations even asking for... A fine meal is a binomial of the kitchen and the saloon, here only the kitchen achieve the task
5
Three of us visited for my birthday over the weekend and thoroughly enjoyed it. Staff helped us to celebrate, making us feel special and were attentive. Food was beautiful; highlights were freshly cut hams, cheese wheels, seafood, freshly baked bread and the desserts section. We opted for unlimited prosecco and we didn't need to ask to have our glasses filled once. In fact, I don't think they were ever empty! Staff indicated at 2.25-2.30pm that the buffet and drinks would close in five minutes; naturally greed kicks in and there's a slight rush as indulgence outweighs decorum and everyone surges towards the dessert stands. A wonderful afternoon. I will definitely be back to cure my cheese cravings.
3
A cheese haven! Parma ham is really fresh but their roast beef section was a great disappointment. Mine was too hard and dry and my husband's one was RAW. Took it back and said to prepare a new one from the kitchen for us and waited 15-20 mins! Seafood soup - the shrimp, mussels and scallop has chewing gum/rubber consistency. This place is overrated I think.
4
Always enjoy their Saturday Brunch. The cheese and tomato + antipasto bar is awesome! Desserts are really nice too. It was very crowded and rowdy the weekend we went but it was because of F1 and I guess many people were doing the pre-race brunch.A little steep if you're not opting in for the free-flow prosecco, but still the place to go if you love cheese, tomatoes and antipasto
4
a good place for Italian food, really worth. My first time there, I will come back one day, it is worth
5
Loved my buffet lunch at Basilico, Regent Hotel! Great selection of food! Everything served was so fresh & of premium quality! Servers were very attentive. Relaxing ambience. Becoming one of my fave buffet spots!
5
Brought the whole family for joint birthday celebration. Excellent & quality spread for semi-buffet. Worth indulging for fine dining.
5
Basilico is the best
I tried the new for share menu. It served for 2 persons, whats inside are lamb chop, beef and chicken.
4
A very wide spread of delicious food and excellent service. Waitress who showed us to our table, addressed us by name throughout the lunch. Nice touch! The restaurant was full and plates were cleared up promptly. A nice enjoyable lunch.
4
Pretty expensive. But you pay for what you get. Food was good. Atmosphere was great. However all comes with a price.
5
Service staff were attentive and helpful. Food was a semi-buffet spread with excellent meats and cheeses. The selection for the main course was wide and varied and would cater to anybody's taste.
5
I have been there before. I booked dinner this time. It was nice and good. I was satisfied with service and food.
5
I have been to numerous buffets but Basilico's lunch buffet is the only one where I regret not having stuffed myself more. There is a wide selection of hams, cheeses and dips. I always go for the parma ham. The selection of the main courses may not be as wide as other hotels'. But really, the quality of the food here simply outshines that of its competitors. The highlight of the main courses has to be the roast beef. The beef is tender and succulent at the fatty parts- simply mouthwatering. The Wagyu lasagna and baked prawns are excellent too. Make sure you leave room for the desserts which are superb. I always go for the gelato; they have about 5 to 7 flavours everyday. The passion cake pie, strawberry pie, apple crumble are as good as, if not better, than speciality bakeries. The mini lemon meringue is simply divine. You will not be able to stop at one or two or three...... While the price of Basilico is not cheap, it's worth every penny. Can't wait to go back there again even though I was there twice this week
5
This is my Nth time in Basilico. Whenever one of our family members celebrate birthday, we also go and eat here. The ambiance, the food and service are always at their best. The staff, executives/managers are all very friendly. We were served this time by Jane. She made sure we are being attended properly and comfortable. She is so awesome, she always wear that smile on her face. Food here is way better than any other hotel buffet that I've been to. The variety of foods, from appetizer to dessert, is superb. For those who are thinking about trying the buffet here, you don't have to think twice. Also I would recommend that you order and try their Focaccia Mascarpone. It's my favorite food in Basilico! You should also try their homemade Gelato. Delicious! Thank you Basilico, I will be back again soon for sure!
4
Authentic, Reasonable Price, Good Ambiance, Attentive Service, what else can you ask for? If your looking for an Italian restaurant in singapore, dont hesitate to try Basilico ❤️❤️❤️
5
Food is fantastic, service top notch. Ate here 2 nights in a row it was so good! Wine list extensive, waitstaff is friendly and efficient. I felt like a guest in their home rather than a hotel guest.

Enjoyed this place but need to improve food quality, Singapore is well known for food but somehow not there.

The Restaurant is a fiesta of colour and food a joy to see. Risotto con finocchietto and formaggi misti good red wine della casa and 3 different desserts
a place to remembered
5
Amazing service! The ambience, attention and friendliness of staff makes me want to come back again. The pizza, burrata cheese and desserts are highly recommended. Great place for romantic dinner and celebration as bill for 2 people will most likely be more than $100.
5
This is really the place for the brunch buffet eater with so much choice of international dishes to choose. But there are a lot of good choices of meat and seafood. Very fresh and well presented. The choice of desserts and fruits are very tempting.

Very good buffet breakfast. Wide variety of foods to choose from. Never got bored with options. Quality of food was very good. Made to order eggs.

If you want an authentic Italian buffet, Basilico at The Regent is a good place to consider. I was impressed with the range of Italian cheese & Italian vegetables on offer. The chef de cuisine personally selected the cheese & tomatoes based on my preferences. With accompanying range of aged balsamic vinegar. But unfortunately they did not offer the vintage variety which usually comes in small bottles with a noble crested wax seal; otherwise they would have got my max 5 stars. As it was a weekday, the usual seafood was not on offer. Seafood as in fresh oysters, king prawns, lobster, clams, mussels etc Hence the reason for my 4 stars. Granted the price is higher during weekends. But nevertheless, the quality of food was mostly refined; which seem to attract a well heeled crowd speaking in hush tones rather than those that would pile up their plates as though there was no tomorrow. An enjoyable slow paced buffet lasting 3 hours in tranquil civilized surroundings. Alan LeongSingapore

The selection of antipasto, cheeses, freshly sliced parma ham is as usual top notch. The hot food selection included roast meat carvery, pizza and pasta, fish, stews, soups. If you still have room, there is also the dessert buffet of cakes, gelato, puddings etc.If you crave italian food, this is a good place to go to.
3
Food selection and quality overall not great. Three of the salad platters were different sliced tomatoes. ALL of them were tasteless. However, lasagne was good. Desserts were good. Our waiter kept taking our knive and fork away, but not replacing.
5
Amazing food as usual. Fabulous spread of appetiser and dessert. The bread and butter pudding dessert is amazing!
4
It is inside a really nice hotel. The variety of drinks is amazing(wine list) and also whiskeys,gins etc. i had the lasagna, the desserts and the appetizers and it was really good recommended 100% great ambience. Worth every penny.
5
Good food and service. The price is something to consider, but if it's a once in a while affair, it's worth the cost.

I had high hopes based on the reviews but was disappointed by a range of things at the brunch. There are was no seafood for starters and the range of other items was quite limited, There was also a conference on and hundreds of people from that conference joined the brunch which I found both bizarre and not very fair to the people who had paid real money to be at the brunch. Had they told us we wouldn't have come.Service was fine but again rushed off their feet due to the conference.Overall disappointing experience
3
I just loved every food served in this restaurant. It's my 3rd time been here and will surely comeback. I really love the spread of the anti-pasti and the desserts! But, one thing I've noticed, the manager of this restaurant choose the guest he wants to entertain (mostly Caucasians) I've been here 3 times but not even once approached or asked if our dinner is fine. Anyway, will still come back coz of the food but not the service I guess.
5
We were looking for a great Italian meal and the basilico restaurant at the Regent Hotel came highly recommended. The ambiance was modern but cosy, the staff were really friendly and accommodating. The food was fabulous. Really great meats and pasta and the starter buffet looked really great. Will definitely be going back as everything on the menu looked fantastic.
5
I can sincerely say that this was one of the best breakfast I had. Although it is expected from a Four Seasons worldwide. The selection of dishes was ranging from European to Asian delights. Everything was fresh and made a la minute. They have a juicer and you can even make your own juices. My husband kept experimenting with it all the way till the end of our stay there. The chefs are lovely so is the front of house staff. They are all welcoming and genuinely eager to serve you. I was mainly at the pastry section and those are to die for!
4
Very happy at the quality and selection of the cold cuts, dips, cheeses, cold cuts and many more appetizers available. As well as the selection of hot food and definitely not to be fogotten, dessert! There is so much food and variety that I ran out of stomach space to try their local selection which offers quite a variety too. I had one of the most decadent chocolate cake in my visit here(: Must Try! Will not regret!

I was attempting to look for a good Italian restaurant in Singapore, partly because I missed the Italian foods that I had during my 2 weeks holidays in Italy.I entered the Basilico on the 2nd floor of Regent Hotel Singapore and was impressed by the deco, as both sides of the entrance was lined by bottles of wines.The winelist was pretty comprehensive, although I was looking for a Bottle of Amarone or Alzero from Quintarelli, but they do not carry them. For starter, we ordered the Burata to share. The Burata does not match the standard that we had in any of the restaurants in Italy. For Main Courses, the Mozarella Cheese wrapped with Wagyu Beef was quite good but the quality of beef can be better, considering the price that they charged.The other Main Course is Linguini with Seafood cooked in Aglio Olio style. This was a huge disappointment. The pasta was not cooked over strong fire, hence not able to bring out the fragrance of the spices. The mussels were so tiny and not fresh. There was no prawns, but only strips of overcooked squids.I will not recommend this restaurant to someone who is looking for Italian Food in Singapore. Comparatively, Da Luca in Goldhill Plaza served better Italian Cuisine.
5
Very impressive selection of cheese. Food was very good! Service is also good. Will definitely visit again.
5
Sunday brunches at Basilico are absolutely great. The food is always of great quality and variety. Absolutely love the cheese room and the fresh seafood they have on offer. Staff are always lovely and friendly.
5
amazing cheese room, good service and attentive staff, great food selection for the Sunday brunch!!!
5
Quality of food was great. Wide variety from semi buffet spread, cheeses, meat, salads, desserts!!! simply delicious!
The staff were very helpful and friendly too.
4
Ambiance was great for a quiet dinner with quality seafood and roasts! The semi-buffet was value for money given the variety of roasts and seafood available. The smoked salmon is definitely a worthy mention. In addition, staff exhibited exceptional service
5
The ambiance is great, service excellent. The appetizer station is amazing and a meal on its own. Apparently almost all ingredients come in from Italy, the cheeses, olives, tomatoes...the tomatoes are awesome. The squid ink bread is a must-try. The truffle "pizza" or bread is delicious. They also comp your parking....the seats looking out on the pool are the best seats.
4
I typically opt for just the antipasto buffet since it's enough food-though you can choose to add on a pasta. Even though the options are all cold items, there are many things I love including prosciutto di Parma, burrata, all types of Italian bread, cold seafood, tons of delicious desserts
4
We had dinner at Basilico with starters and desserts buffet with a choice of a main course. Starters buffet spread was filled with a variety of cold fish (think sashimi but marinated) and meat cold cuts variety. Good quality and replenished ever so often, the cuts don't turn dry with long exposure due to turnover. Good variety of cheeses as well. Breads and self mix basic salad are available as well.A seafood main course was chosen, octopus, lobster and king prawn were all well grilled. By the time you get to desserts, you're almost at your stomach's brim. Gelato is a must have (love the coconut), tirasimu and cakes are not too bad.I would say the stars rests in the starters and mains, I may be too full to give the desserts a fair chance. So that calls for more visits to try the options!If you're reading for service, impeccable.
4
First time coming here and was pleasantly surprised with the quality and spread of their semi-buffet dinner. They had excellent variety of appetizers, cold cuts, smoked fish, cheese and salad. Not to mention the desserts. Bread and butter pudding was superb. Do try the panna cotta . tiramisu and section of ice creams and sorbets. I didn't mention their mains, one is spoilt for choice. We had the angus tenderloin and grilled lobster with squid and king prawns. Excellent place to dine.
1
Food was great but appalled with torn napkin and the way the food was handled by the staff in front of the guest. Staff was chucking the food in the trolley! Also, my friend who has been a corporate and gym member for 10 years did not entitle any discount ( which she normally does) after she discontinued her gym membership yesterday
4
Great food & service staff were attentive. Will defintely visit again in future. One of our favourite restaurants.
5
Food is great as it has a wide spread of selections.
Service from the staff is superb and they are attentive and friendly,
Basilico is one of my favourite restaurants,
4
A good variety of dishes to choose from. Too much to eat. Must go again to try the other dishes which I missed. Love the tomatoes and the four cheese pizza. Leave some room for the apple crumble and bread and butter pudding.
5
Service was very good and prompt. Food was delicious and well-presented. An enjoyable and memorable birthday celebration for my husband!
5
My 3rd visit to Basilico to chill and relax over a good spread of quality food and champagne. Service by the servers are always excellent.
3
Expensive but a good selection of buffet style food. The a la carte menu is probably not worth it. Breakfast here is excellent.
5
Had the Christmas buffet and food was delicious. The cheese platter was top ! The spread is good and generous. Reservation is highly recommended. Price is slightly high but worth it !
5
The salad & appetizer spread is so good. Same for the desserts, the cakes & ice creams are really delicious. Chose the seabass for main course. Highly recommended
5
This is our go-to Sunday brunch in Singapore. The food being offered during brunch is quite a lot and also delicious. We also love the free flow Prosseco option for the brunch. The staff are also very nice and professional. The price is reasonable for the amount of options available, the quality of food served and also Prosseco
4
top range buffet with good choice of italian typical products, that are not easy to find everywhere out of my country. elegant setting, impeccable service, friendly and caring chef whom satisfied my special request. i don't give 5 notch because the selection during week days is less than holidays and because not all specialities was absolutely fresh, irrepleaceble circumstances for a restaurant on this category
5
Basilico never disappoints. There is something for every picky palate and I always leave the place feeling happy and about to explode. The variety and freshness of the food is unmatched. Super delish!
5
Hostresses were helpful, chef was helpful too introducing different kinds of cheeses pairing with which sides...if not, i'll be like a silly one choosing the wrongs! Haha!! Thank you, Chef!
5
...from the service to the food there was absolutely nothing to pick upon. Will remember this experience for a long time!
5
Great experience and will return back again. The service staff deserved good compliments for attending to the guests
5
We are in Singapore celebrating our 40 years wedding anniversary, I learn about Basilico thanks my search in trip advisor.The attention was great, food is very fresh and the variety superb, we tried everything, also we could order a main course, we asked for the mixed BBQ meat, ir came in a huge clay pot with the perfectly cooked pieces of lamb chops, wagyu beef, tenderloin accompanied with baby potatoes, baby carrots, espÃ¡rragos an artichoke hearts, the pot was sealed with pizza dough. Unfortunately we weren't that hungry anymore with the endless antipasto we had before, they also gave is little surprises, like, twice fresh baked bread with pizza dough filled wit a cherry tomato and with a little pot with green olive tapenade, also two slices of pizza filled with mascarpone cheese drizzled with truffle balsamic vinegar cream, the desserts were delicious and very classy, I will add as many pictures as I can. Over all it was worth it every dollar, it's pricy but we will definitely go back before our return to Australia
5
Not usually a fan of buffets, I was luke-warm about a buffet Italian lunch at Basilico and only went after so many friends had recommended it over the last couple of years. I'm SO glad that I did! It is easily the best buffet meal I've ever eaten! We especially enjoyed all the antipasto and cheeses. Chef Angelo was very visible and took an interest in people's dining experience. He recommended we try the truffle honey (yes that's right!) on grana padano. What a taste sensation! We had already passed that by. He then made us a delightful little dish with grilled torino (I think?) cheese and shaved truffle on a crostini. Delicious! We also enjoyed the beautiful selection of fresh roasted meat, particularly the tender, juicy beef nad then the array of gorgeous desserts. My daughter's favourite was the lemon cheesecake. the service was impeccable and discreet, neither is common in Singapore. We'll be back
5
Ate breakfast every morning in the Basilico. Chef there will make your eggs any way you want. Breakfast bar is huge and includes yogurt and many different types of bread and breakfast pastries besides all the other things you normally eat for breakfast. Staff is friendly and knowledgeable. After first day, remembered I wanted cranberry juice
5
A little on the pricey side but when you have quality food you don't mind so much. We shared an entree, had our own mains which were absolutely delicious. We had 1 wine each and that was it, the bill was about $170. Staff were attentive. A very nice restaurant, excellent service and food
4
@TheKuoKnowsItalian restaurants don't get much better than this. From the moment you step into Basilico, you have the feeling that you are about to experience something very special.The antipasti buffet is a sight for sore eyes. From cured meats to crisp salads to exotic cheeses, there is something for everyone. There is probably enough on offer without even having to consider a main course.But that would be a mistake. The a la carte selection is breathtakingly deligtful.The Risotto is something to die for. It is silky and luscious; thick and creamy and just the right amount of ingredients to keep you going back for mouthful after mouthful.Basilico certainly ticks all the boxes for a fine dining. The service is impeccable. The ambience is faultless. And most importantly, the food is quite superb.
4
Wow! What a treat! We booked a table for 3 for their semi buffet dinner extravaganza. It was SG$ 64 per head and add another SG$10 for free flow Prosecco. We missed out on the Wagyu Beef Bresaola which was replaced with duck meat but that was my only grumble. The Chef sent over complimentary tasters of herbed melted cheese between what looked like thin pizza crusts. there were 3 types of fat fluffy mozzarellas to try, plenty of imported farmed olive oils to drizzle and and a healthy display of desserts.We also ordered carbonara to share but couldn't finish that off because we were really full up on the beautiful buffet offerings. The staff were very friendly without being over the top and diners were allowed in wearing smart casuals. I went for the proscuito with melon, beautiful parma ham, and other cold cuts with Italian flair. The next row was a big barrel of parmigianna you can just chip off and other typical cheese you'd find on an Italian dinner table . I really loved the experience and i thought it was really good value
4
Food was of top quality. The only let down was the lobster and prawns mains. However, the chef immediately changed it which was perfectly cooked. Don't leave without trying all the dessert. It is a must!
5
Price was on the higher side for a buffet lunch on public holiday, but the food and service were good, and it was full Italian fare. Worth going once in a while
5
Great selection of good
Wonderful desserts
Love the roast beef with peppercorn sauce
We'll be back - highly recommend
5
Staff is super friendly and accommodating, food is superb! Ambiance and the crowd is fun and vibe is very enjoyable! We'll be back for sure!
5
My wife and family enjoyed coming to Basilico at The Regent Hotel for lunch and dinner. It has a nice ambiance and array of food on offer.We often skipped the mains because the antipasti table had already substantial choices of cheese, salad, cold cut, cured salmon, and bread, which we often came back for more.We loved their dressing and Balsamic vinegar, all from Italy, and they tasted great! We felt that it's one place that was closest in bringing us back to Tuscany.The mains were also very nice and delicious; they were prepared fresh in the stations around the impressive antipasti table in the middle. Service was friendly, attentive, and with a smile.We often came out the restaurant fully satisfied
3
This is one of my favourite restaurants and was looking forward to a long lazy lunch with my family who are in town for the week. Booked in plenty of time but was given a table in an annexe with 4 large tables of families with children under two. The noise was unrelenting as you would expect from a large number of babies in a small room. Staff seemed harassed and unable to keep up. We couldn't get water refills and eventually went looking for a jug to help ourselves. Same went for plates left on the table when we went up for the next buffet course. Food was good as always and I can't fault it but too eat it in what felt like a creche was frankly unacceptable and we couldnt get out of there quick enough.
5
It was my second time at Basilico and the food was as good as I remember! The semi-buffet choices were to die for: a wide selection of cheese, salad, carpaccio etc. The main course was fantastic as well; my friend and I had the beef tenderloin and the Tonnarelli with beef and they were both delicious. This place is truly worth the price for the selection and quality of food you get. Also, it was my friend's birthday and they provided a cake with her name written on the plate, and even gave us 2 glasses of prosecco. Really above and beyond. Service was fantastic, though they seemed understaffed. Will come back again :
5
The cheese selection, pastas and pizzas. Everything was amazing. There was a wide variety and options for everyone. Also totally worth the price. Highly recommend it for the ambience, widespread choice and quality. Have been previously for an a-la-carte meal but the buffet is a true steal
5
So little Italian buffets in Singapore, but when there's Basilico, does it matter?Most buffets in Singapore are heavy on the South-east Asian and Japanese offerings, and they all get boring really quickly. Quality is generally subpar for most items too.Thankfully, there's Basilico to offer a different variety of food - authentic Italian, with acceptable, if not excellent, quality in every buffet item. My favourite was the cheese selection (especially the soft buffalo cheese), which were excellent paired with different types of tomatoes and some aged balsamic vinegar.At 55++ for weekday lunch, this was a steal
4
Went there for dinner and was pleased with the experience. The ambience was rather good and the risotto was done very well. Hearty serving that was full of flavour. To my surprise, there was a 15 percent discount for CitiBank credit cards. However, the wait was a tad too long, especially since we showed up on time for our 1830 reservation. Overall, enjoyed the experience and will definitely return soon
4
Good spread of quality food and service. The only minus point is the slow service in free flow of wine.
4
Basilico is strong value, food is high quality and service very high level.
There were little less choice than in the past ( or it gave this impression), I regret the truffle risotto was missing again.
Else excellent
4
This italian restaurant has delicious food to offer, directly from the traditional italian cuisine. Tha ambiance is nice and the staff is very friendly.
5
It was quite nice & decend food !!
Very nice table seating ! Ambience was quite good !!one of my favorite place !! We will come back again soon !! Thanks
5
The restaurant treated us perfectly well! Upon confirmation of our booking, they found out that we were celebrating our 17th wedding anniversary and gave us a prime seat in the house. Followed by a lovely slice of cake with wishes written in delectable chocolate sauce. Thank you! Our 17th anniversary has been made perfect by you!
5
This was my third visit and this visit was to introduce my family to this wonderful, Practical restaurant! "Practical"? The buffet starters has a selection of Italian soft and matured cheeses (and one soaked in red wine as well), cold cuts of Ham cappciios Salami cold cuts , large green olives, greens and veggies eggplant, asparagus and many more..So you order your drinks and settle down with your yummy starters! And for wine lovers a wide selection awaits you..  At the end the dessert buffet list is endless with hot and cold items ranging from hot puddings, tiramisu, gelato selection etc etc To be honest I glanced at the selection and avoided as I just couldn't afford the extra calories.. But my family tucked in! So you have a wide selection of starters and desserts to try out in small portions.. The Middle..Mains you could order a la cartel or off the set menu which includes the starter buffet and the desert buffet and a top selection of their main courses.. Goat, beef Pork etc all beautifully prepared in generous portions and "pesce" lovers as myself there was seafood rissoto, salmon, cod etc to choose from. Highly recommend this..visit to believe!
5
I've tried quite a few of the Singapore brunches and this has to be one of the best!!! The cheese room is incredible, great range of hot food and seafood. Not a huge dessert range but that was fine for me. There are 2 packages $165 for free flow champagne Perrier Jouet or $135 for prosecco. I had the champagne which was lovely but the glasses were massive so it didn't stay as cold as I would like. We sat outside next to the pool which was actually very comfortable shaded and not too hot. It went from 12-3pm but the staff were friendly and let you bend that a little bit. A must for cheese lovers the range was incredible
5
Mid week lunch with Husband. Delicious anti pasta, salads, mozzarella and cheeses. There is more than enough in this part of the buffet to satisfy but Basilco also offers a good range of Italian dishes and a selection of Asian dishes( in my opinion not needed) something for everyone!
5
Today my dear friend and I treated ourselves to a buffet lunch after a 14 day invigorating but rough adventure in the beautiful mountains of Nepal. We felt tired and hungry and dressed comfortably(very casually with little effort) after searching the halls for a welcoming and appropriate place to replenish we chose Basilico. The food on the buffet looked delicious and endless but we initially felt uncomfortable as those around us were dressed in designer clothing were well groomed and styled from head to toe. Then we met our waitress Li Ting she made us laugh encouraged us to try the delicious varieties and embraced our decision to purchase the cheapest, but delicious bottle of wine from the wine list! We immediately felt at ease amongst the opulence and no longer cared we were wearing thongs and singlets( and pants of course). Thanks Basilico for the delicious food and a very special thanks to Li Ting for making us smile and feel so welcome
4
Didn't do my research properly and thought it was a full buffet restaurant. However, it's a appetiser & dessert buffet whereas the main course (limited items) are ordered separate. The spread for buffet isn't much but the quality of the appetisers kind of made up for it. The burrata cheese and tomatoes are seriously amazing. The desserts are pretty average tbh. My family overall had an enjoyable time with the great service from the waitres
4
We went for lunch buffet! Food selections are great, although I wish there are cheese platter too!
The staffs are really friendly! It's expensive but worth-it!
5
Tranquility prevails in this romantic, classy setting with epicurean dining. Semi-buffet option is available. Suitable for couples' dining and group/family setting as well.
4
We had a great lunch at Basilico for our 4th wedding anniversary. We pretty much liked a variety of cheeses, fresh seafood salads, and the dessert, while the cooked dishes, such as pasta, steak, pizza, were not impressive.
5
My favourite buffet place in Singapore. Food, service and place are really one of the best in Singapore.
4
We love the mascarpone focaccia and the wine selection. Limited menu choices for vegetarians. Soup was so-so.
5
I've been a patron of Basilico since the days when the buffet was under SGD50, and the food has always remained at a high standard. Despite shedding most of its "value-for-money" status at SGD80++ these days, the lunch buffet at Basilico still remains one of the most highly sought after options in town.The staff at Basilico also make it a point to remember your favourite table at the establishment, and perhaps this is service, far more personalized than most restaurants in Singapore have to offer. If only the familiar faces didn't change as often over the years.
3
The food was great, as usual, but a little disappointed by the service. We had to ask on several occasions for a drink, and at one point had to ask the waited three times. I do not think there was enough staff on to cope with the business of the restaurant
4
On my very short trip to Singapore I went to his hotel which is on level 2 of Singapore regent hotel for brunch. They have a good Buffet spread and also Ala carte ... I opted for Ala carte. And their seafood pasta is very good. Their antipasto selection is also good and a must try
4
We looked forward to the breakfast at Basilico during our stay at the Regent. Especially the Asian fare — Nasi Lemak, Dimsum, Teochew noodles, fish ball soup.... Delicious and varied.The staff was very attentive and the decor very trendy like the rest of the hotel
4
Went there for a business meeting and I was not expecting much in terms of food. I did not have a taste for Italian cuisine anyway. But was was pleasantly surprised by the warmth of the chef who took great interest in explaining each dish, and made a recommendation when I got completely confused. still do not know the name of dish but it was simply superb. Now I want to go there again-just to know what the name is so that I can order it which ever Italian place I go
5
My friends and I went for brunch there. Very good quality of the food. The service is excellent. Nice location. Real espresso coffee.
5
It has been always a pleasure to eat there. Good service, nice atmosphere and in particular the cold food (appetizer and dessert) is great.
5
Usually main dishes and desserts are lagging behind the cheese/risotto/pasta experience in most italian brunches... @Basilico, everything is perfect : from cold cuts, to traditionnal main dishes w/ incredible ragouts, and desserts really at the level you expect. Cheese choice and breads, buffala/mozza.. great choice, great tastes. Excellent service on top pf that and super feasonnably priced !!! Very very well done Basilico
2
I just ate here again after more than a year hoping things had improved. Unfortunately they have not.While the waiter was fabulous, the tasteless Spaghetti alla Napoletana were as "al dente" as food they'd serve to hospitalised 90 year olds.The branzino was very average in its presentation and flavour.The Apple crumble was very good so congrats to the pastry Chef.The espresso was horrible and sticker shock 9 dollars!!!! I'm done with Basilico and it's over-prices not even trattoria level food.Chef, your food needs lots of work and you should be in the kitchen instead of walking around and chatting for an hour. Food for thought
5
Tried their winter menu of Italy last night. They have a wide range of bread, cold cuts, salad with more than 10 types of olive oil dressings, main course of lamb chops and haddocks was very delicious and tender. A whole section of italian cheeses and desserts including sorbets and gelatos. Ambiance was cosy with a touch of elegance. Tables were well space apart and full linen service. Staff were very attentive and prompt with their service. I was having an apps issue with my hp and the staff was very alert and offer a suggestion. Had a great dinner with my family.Highly recommended
3
Ambiance matters, and Basilico is sorely lacking. After seeing the glowing reviews on trip advisor for Basilico, I decided to take my fiance there for her birthday. During reservations, I wrote that fact in the comments section, hoping that there would be a little extra attention provided. That did not work. The hostess walked us in to the buffet room and sat us right next to a husband and wife with a young child - about 3 years old - that at the time we were being led to our seats was literally banging on the table screaming while the parents happily enjoyed their wine. I understand children will be at restaurants, but an experienced, caring hostess would have taken one look at a well dressed couple on a Friday night date and know that they will not want to sit next to a screaming child. The buffet was fine. Fresh food, but nothing that I couldn't get at a local supermarket. The meal was hit and miss. I had the beef tenderloin that, as soon as you touch the meet on the plate the entire thing just became a mess, and my fiance had the tuna. The tuna was done perfectly and the plate was overall, nice. The cannoli I had for dessert did not taste like any cannoli I had ever had. In short, Basilico is simply a place to have an average meal. I would pass on it for a special date
5
I ate here one evening as a part of my stay at The Regent Hotel and I have to say that I was very pleasantly surprised to eat genuine Italian food cooked to perfection! I particularly liked that the chef was very evident in the dining room and made a point of going around the tables talking to diners and explaining aspects of the menu, etc....a really nice touch!The menu is wide ranging, but not over complicated by vast options...it's a really solid and flavoursome range of choices. My food was piping hot and all three courses were well balanced and large enough without being too large. Nice range of wines too.I'd thoroughly recommend the Basilico to all
3
Sorry for the hiatus in reviews...dropped by Basilco at Regent Hotel last night as friends were craving for their previous excellent food experience there (albeit almost a few months since their last visit). The ambience and the greeting /seating/ serving formalities was as we expected - excellent. Wine was good with a nice range of Italian grapes. Then came the down, we ordered the usual soups and pastas namely the vongole and wagyu beef selection. Although the dishes were a bit mistimed due to a miscommunication, we felt the food quality had dropped so much and the vongole was a variation which didn't make sense from the past. I cannot be have felt the meal was not worth the amount paid ... perhaps the Restaurant is beginning to sit on their laurels and not improve. It will be a while before I come back (sic).... 3 thumbs is already a generous vote for food that other lesser priced could provide better.
3
spread was reasonable, but quality was excellent as usual, especially the antipasti and desserts sections
5
We were staying at The Regent and decided to "eat in". Excellent decision. An amazing Italian style buffet - the meats, the cheeses, variety of grilled vegetables and lovely salads and dressings. The fish is excellent too. The food is fresh and the choice is superb. The staff are attentive and very efficient. The chefs are milling around and seem to be very proud of their fare. The chefs are very attentive and willing to advise on choices. Save some space for the desserts which are excellent too.It seems very reasonably priced, particularly in Singapore
5
We came here for lunch and food was delicious and drinks were fantastic with great taste. Staffs were extremely welcoming and inviting. Definitely a must !
5
Food was great!! Love the cheese counter and the chef were there to help on cheese selections. The staffs were very attentive too.
5
Yes, I know it is an Italian restaurant but I would say it is the best buffet in Singapore across all cuisines in terms of the spread, the taste and the cost. Absolutely outstanding!
4
Generous spread with seafood like boston lobster, prawns and scallops. But no oysters. Good spread of charcuterie and cheeses. Cooked food was a bit of hit and miss. Roast counter was a bit disappointing.
5
Amazing spread of Italian food. They had a room entirely dedicated to cheese! Food was absolutely outstanding!
5
as usual, the service and food was good. i particularly like the salad, cheese selection and variety of dessert.
4
This is an exceptionally high quality buffet (having said that it's still a buffet). Antipasti were fresh with a good selection of cold cuts and salads etc. Pasta was fresh and tasty. Nice meat cuts. Great smoked salmon. A superb selection of Italian cheese (which meant I had to order a glass of red wine!). Then really nice desserts to finish. Reasonably priced for Singapore. Overall an excellent selection of Italian fare
5
The many times I have been here have only proven time and time again that this place is exceptional.Food is AMAZINGLY good. And to think I've not discovered the Cheese Room until my most recent trip.Definitely recommending EVERYONE to dine here for a gastronomic experience

For a casual new year's lunch with friends we chose to try out the Sunday Brunch at Basilico restaurant situated inside the Regent Hotel in Singapore. We were deeply impressed with our experience, the great food, excellent service and the wonderful atmosphere provided by Basilico. Our lunch started great when we were shown a very nice and quiet table on the "outer rings" of the restaurant. Basilico is actually laid out in a circular shape with the main food stations mostly placed in the central "courtyard" in the middle, and the guest seating located in a circular fashion right around the main buffet area. This is not only quite practical (short distances to all buffets), but also allows for separate seating areas which provide a lot of privacy in the middle of a stunning hotel lobby. Also, the noise levels from the busy buffet is significantly reduced, and thus it is a lot easier to really enjoy a good lunch conversation in an almost "private dining room" like atmosphere.The food offerings were fantastic throughout, and very much to our liking. For details, I recommend to check out Basilico's online menu, but it must be highlighted that what sets this lunch offer apart is not only the great variety and bountiful choices offered for truly authentic Italian fare, but the very high quality of the ingredients used by the excellent chefs. All the dishes and food items we tried were extremely tasty and very fresh as well. The food stations were a delight to look at, and the smells, colors, sounds and sights (there is a lot of live cooking!) were absolutely gorgeous to take in. A lot of the Italian classics were served, and all of them convinced us with great taste combinations, a beautiful presentation and a great variety with respect to different regional cuisines from Italy. The dessert and cheese sections as well as the fresh pasta station are especially noteworthy. We also were quite impressed by the impeccable service, and special thanks to Ms. Emmie who took care of us so well and with such high professionalism and friendliness that we could not have asked for more. All staff we interacted with were super friendly, and really tried to make our experience fun and enjoyable - and we all got the impression that they were truly happy and proud to serve us one of the finest Italian lunches I have been to in a very long time. Basilico was a delight, and offered very high value and outstanding food and service: bellissimo!

The food was of decent quality and the spread was average. Enjoyed sampling the different cheeses and cold cuts but other than that, the variety was actually not as much as I expected.
5
One of the best breakfast and lunch buffets I've had. Especially loved the desserts at lunch. The private rooms are also great for meetings.
5
A well valued buffet. Never knew buffet could have such high standard. Very enjoyable meal. Value n good quality food .
5
It's always a pleasure to be back at Basilico!
The antipasti is amazing, the mains good too and now there is a small Chinese section. Please save room for dessert!
The service is great, my glass of water is never empty!
5
Wonderful spread and great service. Outstanding attention to detail: knows when to serve up birthday cake at the right moment and "course" without my cue. Thanks for the experience!
4
Spread and dessert is very good.
I enjoyed the different cheeses, pastas and meat. Parking is super expensive though.
5
Everything at Basilico is perfect - the ambiance, food and service!
Also the price is really good value for the quality
5
We don't usually have high expectations when we try a buffet restaurant but Basilico was a wonderful surprise. It is the best Italian buffet restaurant that we have tried. The spread was plentiful and most of the dishes were delicious. Make sure to try a little bit of everything including the cheeses. We also loved the desserts. We will return to Basilico when we are in Singapore
5
Quality is as good as top in ItalyAmazing cheese and olive range as well as lots of different olive oils and balsamic Great desserts incl panna cota cheesecake tiramisu gelato chocolate cake etcAll better than most places in the world Make sure you arrive hungry !!
5
Chose Basilico at the Regent Hotel for a Sunday Brunch. Excellent choice. Service was extremely good range and quality of food exceptional for a buffet style meal. Special mention for the cheese 'room' which must have 40 options many flown in from Italy. Great value for money with options to have free flow wine or soft drinks.
5
Dinner with friends on a rainy day turned out better with good food, good wine & good service. While waiting for friends stuck in traffic, friendly staff served sparkling water & corn bread. We shared Foie gras with truffle & buratta with balsamico for starters, bacon wrapped haddock, slow cooked lamb shank, Angus aged tenderloin & pasta vongole for main courses, chose Tuscan Chianti Classico '2011 to accompany. Delicious & memorable

It was my Daughter in law as well as my grandsons birthday. My son arranged a dinner at the Italian restaurant at the Regent-Basilico
Great food, wonderful wines, extra odinary service .Totally delightful
5
Staff was super friendly, good selection of lunch buffet menu and ambience was lovely. Highly recommended
5
Took my family to the restaurant and had a lovely sumptuous dinner. The service was great, the ambience of the restaurant was lovely and the food was delicious.
5
Best buffet I ever had, hands down
Basilico continues to prove that it is the best Italian buffet in Singapore
5
We usually don't go a lot to restaurants in hotels but this one is really worth it. They have a semi-buffet with appetizers and desserts and you can make any combination you want with or without a main course Ã  la carte. We went there for dinner and I had the appetizer buffet and dessert buffet without main course and I left the place stuffed. You can actually eat from the appetizer buffet as a starter and a main course because there is so many on offer and there are so many good things you want to try out. The staff is also tremendously friendly and helpful. Only negatives is that it was a bit cold inside and the wine is rather expensive. I'd recommend it
3
The antipasti, cheeses, bread etc. continue to be the star of this meal. The salad offering is mediocre and the absence of mushrooms continues to be an odd blind spot. The crusted tuna was above average and the beef was sublime for the main course. The dessert selection is only average. The service is excellent for a buffet, attentive, friendly but never intrusive. The standard has been maintained over the past 4 years we have been eating here
5
It's very European with a heavy slant towards Italian cuisine. It's not the usual buffet spread in Singapore where one is bound to find some local dishes occupying a slot somewhere. The meats and thin (as it should be) crust pizzas are good. If you are a bread person - there is a huge variety. There is an option to order something off the a la carte menu and top it up with the buffet spread. The lamb off the menu and in the buffet spread are great. I like my lamb and they do it well
5
We were just going to have one breakfast here for our son's birthday, however the service was so good and the food so wonderful we splurged for our stay. Loved it. The staff went above and beyond for our little seven year old and were so grateful. Beautiful restaurant in a beautiful hotel
3
Nice place with delicious meal. A large choice of italian food.Great for breakfast within the Regent HotelQuite long during dinner / you could wait more than 30 m
5
We didn't have sufficient time to indulge in the buffet as we had a plane to catch later the same night, so we ordered from the a la carte menu. Everything we ordered was exquisitely prepared and delicious. We have two vegetarian kids teenagers who found great options on the menu. We'll try the brunch sometime soon.

Best Italian Buffet
The Great Stuff
- Quality of Food (Beef Lasagna was extremely awesome)
- A Good Italian Spread
- Great Desserts, Especially the Chocolate Ice Cream
Not so good
- The soups weren't particularly good
- The roasted turkey was really dry
5
The consistency year after year is just tip top!
And the consistency is across service as well as the quality of the food!
5
Everything from pizzas to breads to deserts are so good. We were there for lunch for our wedding anniversary.
4
I was there for the Christmas buffet and the food was excellent! The lobster bisque and rainbow ravioli stuffed with king crab and foe gras (if I recall correctly) was amazing. I enjoyed the desserts and log cakes immensely as well. The service was impeccable, and our dishes were cleared promptly. I'm looking forward to my next visit there
5
I've been to Basilico many times over the years. Almost always to the lunchtime buffet. There is the option to have free-flow wine or prosecco, free-flow fresh juice or just the food and pay for a glass of something separately. if you wish. There is a large circle of tables laden with a huge choice of antipasti items. There is a range of hot dishes including pasta, pizza, meat, fish and vegetables. As I am a vegan I tend to stick to the antipasti but friends always enjoy the hot dishes too. If you are a sweet lover there is again a good choice. The sweets go quickly so if you have a favourite it's a good idea to grab it early!I had to choose only one cuisine to eat for the rest of my life it would be Italian. Basilico is a delight and excellent value for money.
5
I've been curious about trying Basilico as had often heard good things, so what better occasions than Christmas dinner?An excellent all-around feast ensued, from the wide arrange of burratas and salumi for appetizers, to the classic shellfish selection, to various types of pastas including the famous agnolottis, finishing with roasted meats including a very moist turkey and roast-beef. Very good tiramisu and sorbets can help finish things off.Regarding value, I have to say I have spent similar amounts for a much lesser amount of quality food (and booze) elsewhere, so that box is also ticked. I know where I'll head next time I'm craving an Italian feast, in a jovial setting, with competent and professional staff.
4
This was the second time I've come here for the lunch buffet and once again we were pleased with the spread that Basilico has! They have a good amount of dishes and the food here is delicious. The restaurant itself is nicely decorated and we love coming here during Christmas time as the Regent hotel is beautifully decorated
4
Basilico restaurant is in the Regent Hotel which also has a good cocktail bar called Manhatten. We thought we would have cocktails before dinner. We went over for dinner about 8.30-9pm. The food is great. The problem we had was that after our starter and main course around 10pm they cleared everything away ! All deserts disappeared and they closed down the service. For a restaurant such as this, 10pm is way too early in my opinion and ruined the end to a good meal. Everything else was great, but they should stay open a little longer
5
On our last night in Singapore, this trip, my wife and I decided to eat 'in house' at the restaurant Basilico. We were unbelievably and pleasantly surprised at the quality of the food and the friendly efficiency of the servers. We ate off the a la carte menu as with Buffett selections we inevitably overeat and the breadth and depth of the buffet at Basilico would have ensured that. The Carpaccio di Bue was succulent and thickly sliced, while the Branzino was an outstanding entree, and the Rigatoni was an ideal choice for my vegetarian wife. We enjoyed a Proseco aperitif, a bottle of Chianti Classico from the area of Lamole which we had recently visited and the Amarone was a perfect digestif. Claudine was a darling wait person and followed up even when she had to hand off to another team member because of the work balance. We ate outside on the patio between the Basilico room and the pool because the room was simply too cold when we arrived. The outside temperature was ideal and the light rainstorm added a special flavor to the evening. The only downside was the degree to which several customers failed to respect a reasonable dress code and the room management staff felt precluded from bringing that issue to the attention of the respective guest. To many, class begets class and the ambiance, food, and wait staff service attitude certainly should beget respect
2
I have no idea what are others raving this place about Except the desserts which were good but nothing exceptional, hot dishes were a big disappointmentMy friend ordered a small pasta for his child and it came at the end of the mealVery slow service only one person looking after 30 persons !!! Being a Four Seasons association, our expectation was of service being impeccable , however like other places in singapore , this place also falls flat when it comes to delivery!!!!Chef needs to look into the hot food as most of food was cold especially near the live counter and also on other side Breads and pastry was only saving grace Serious service issues and hope Managment looks into the same
5
Not too crowded and we were able to eat our dinner in peace. The dessert n salad spread was fantastic . Would love to go back again
4
Food is as usual excellent.
lot of choice, fresh food and from top quality.
antipasti is wonderful like dessert.
Just missed my favorite plate : Truffle rissot
4
Had the semi buffet dinner at Basilico a couple of days back. The appetizer and dessert buffet was exceptional in terms of quality and range. The mains were good but not excellent. Service was exemplary throughout the entire course of the dinner.
5
Nice food and very well managed. Staff is courteous and efficient. Good variety and combination of different style food.
4
Food was really good. We had a superb beef tenderloin, and a seafood risotto. Service was attentive.
4
Quiet enough, service was warm, great variety... non-meat eater but just as good, will recommend to others.
4
Good food, service warm, must try. Great variety and will go back but some discounts will encourage repeat patronage sooner.
5
We came back for my husband birthday and the food was excellent as always. It is semi-buffet style which you can have buffet for appetizers and deserts and one main course of your choice
5
Basilico is one of my fave haunts for a great meal with a great value!
The service is warm and friendly and the food spread is great.
I'm a repeat patron of this fab place!
5
Awesome food and great service. The restaurant has become a favourite dining choice for lunch or dinner. Superb service and quality of food. Love the choice of burrata cheeses, meats, ice creams and dessert! My compliments to the chefs, service staff and management!
5
Went Herw for lunch a few weeks back. It was a wonderful meal. Food was cooked very well and the service was genuine and professional. Wish other places in Singapore were like this.
5
The best Italian buffet you can find in Singapore. I doubt you can find a better spread of antipasti and the desserts have their individual flavours. You don't have 2 different desserts tasting the same.
5
Great team service staff that made everything else seem perfect. Food was expected which was great as always and the level of service just keeps wowing me.
5
Been at Basilico for brunch: impressed by the "italian" (real) quality of the food and wines. Excellent service, delightful atmosphere: the "cheeses room" is a must with its barrata choices. It's a MUST when in SG
3
The restaurant service was excellent but I cannot say the same for the food. It was average but the desserts faired slightly better.
5
Very good restaurant with outstanding food with a huge selection of real Italian appetisers (buffet) and a very good menu from all over Italy
4
We went for brunch on more than one occasion and found this to be a good Italian restaurant with an excellent choice of wine by the glass. Whilst a large restaurant located in a five star hotel it was not too noisy and was a good experience, not in the least pretentious. Would recommend a visit whether a couple, family or groups of friends
1
I've unfortunately had the displeasure of eating at this restaurant twice in the same month. The first time I chose this restaurant (a mistake I promised I wouldn't repeat) and the 2nd time another group chose the restaurant. All of us have admitted being fooled by their ranking on TripAdvisor. The first night I went with a group of 10 people, on a slow week night. The average check was over S$200 per person but do you think we could get anyone to clear the table of all of the dirty dishes from the buffet? My group was eating dessert (without cutlery) while pizza plates, pasta plates and other dirty dishes lay in the centre of the table while 4 male staff members chatted in the centre of the restaurant. As there were only 4-5 tables in total occupied that night, the service was absolutely terrible. When I went back a few weeks later (not by choice) I had to correct the drink order 3 times before it was served properly. And then the head chef comes to our table to give us a "special" dish (not asking if we wanted it, of course) and proceeded to call one of my female teammates "sir." I was horrified. The best word I can use to describe Basilico is SLACK. You deserve more for your money
2
The staff really seemed to have a difficult time connecting. Hard to get their attention to refill the water glasses as they walk pass. Took forever to serve the wine. Pumpkin soup was very good but the Indian food was very heavy and the bread doughy. I was overall disappointed. Expected better given the reviews.
5
One of the best Italians in Singapore. They serve a very good menu during the week. The weekend they offer a magnificent buffet, and on Sunday it is topped by a huge selection of Italian cheeses - I'm Italian and a cheese lover, but some of them I'd never tried before. Buffet not cheap, but worth it and with free flow of wine (or champagne with a surcharge)
5
It's not the first time to visit but the quality can still maintain. The famous part is the appetizer and dessert buffet. You can still enjoy the buffets without main course. It's signature pizza is another "must try" item.
5
Excellent buffet selection with great quality mozzarella cheese, fresh produce and outstanding desserts. The bread and butter pudding is a blast! The best I've ever had.
5
Food quality was excellent especially dessert.. Very worth the price especially with Chope promotion.. We enjoy the meal very much..
5
Excellent italian food for a good price if you like buffet style servings. Beautiful decor, knowledgeable and helpful staff with good initiative. Great for large groups!
5
The Chefs at Basilico were very helpful in catering to my special dietary requirements. The buffet dishes looked excellent too, attracting plenty of local patrons. Service was very good, always friendly. The restaurant has a nice design and a pleasant atmosphere.
5
We decided to order from the a la carte menu this time as we are "off" desserts, sadly, for dietary reasons and were very pleased that we did. The asparagus soup I had was one of the best I have ever had and his foie gras was exquisitely pan fried with a marrow (still in the bone). The ricotta ravioli with pork sausage for my main dish was robust and flavourful while his lamb chops were grilled to perfection. A bottle of chianti rosso completed a very satisfying meal. we will be back again. Salude
4
Kids were comfortable. The crew were sensitive to kids' needs. Food was great. Portions were reasonable but what got me most were the flavours of various spices infused into the dishes. It gave the various traditional dishes a new twist. Nothing over the top or crazily fusion...just a gentle touch of ingenuity
5
Basilico. What a wonderful word. The semi-buffet had an amazing assortment of antipasti this far of Italy. Cold cuts, salads, Italian breads and a cheese selection made it difficult to choose! Then there's a good 3 page selection of entrees to choose from. Pastas to tenderloins. It had something for everyone. Top up a little bit more and you get to enjoy 2 glasses of good wine to pair the meal with. And the dessert selection at the end was heavenly! Cannoli, gelato, cakes, tiramisu and the lost goes on. By the time we had finished, there wasn't room for anything else! Really good value for money given the quality of food.
4
I gotta say they have have superb service at this restaurant and great ambience too! However, the main course wasn't as appetizing as what i thought. I was pretty disappointed with the food. Mussels was really small & shrivel, pasta was not tasty. Seriously, I didn't expect this kind of food quality from a 5 stars hotel
3
As always, Basilico is good, but this time we do have a few comments.The organization is not as before, especially the table service is wrong. There is no guiding hand anymore.There was that night not many customers.A few times they came with drink / food that were not meant for us.When making reservations, they always ask if it's for a special occasion and so was the birthday of my husband.We went for the full menu, everyone around us was given a birthday cake, except my husband.We have waited a long time and did not go to the dessert corner on principle.We finally asked the bill
3
Food was average. Antipasti and Dessert buffet was allright-ish. Our main courses were lukewarm. Service was also average. Had to pour my own wine and ask for appropriate cutleries ahaha. Not worth the price.
5
Very good service from the staff at Basilico and the Chef was excellent with his signature dishes, cooked to perfection.
4
Fifth time here in the space of 3 years and and it is still very good ! Haf focussed on the Italian selection the last few times but this time also had the Chinese selection- and we were glad we did! Great service too.
4
The spread never dissapoint. The restaurant uses high quality products and consistently offer delicious food
5
This is a great brunch place in Singapore. I have had brunch at the Fullerton and didn't like it, but here the Italian brunch is great - great service, quality, and selection. Price is ok. The atmosphere is relaxed and familiar.
5
Nothing went wrong. All were right and as usual, yet another beautiful evening experience at this restaurant ever. I go there for the nice setting, soothing ambience, attentive staffs, good meat, great olive, excellent wine; I got all those, so yes, good restaurant. Perfect.
4
My family loves this restaurant - we've been coming for a number of years now. The food was great as usual, but if you're visiting this month, be aware that the kitchen is currently under renovation. When they called to confirm my reservation the day before, they told me this meant there would be no pizza. In fact, there was one pizza available, but it was a thick, bready kind of pizza, quite different from their usual. They also seem to have changed their utensils, and the knives aren't quite as sharp as they sometimes need to be to cut into the meats - you can ask for a steak knife if necessary. They've also changed the crackers that accompany the cheeses! They're not bad, but I miss the thin cheesy crackers they used to have. Still, top your cheese with some truffle honey for a real treat. The parma ham was also on point that day. And the desserts, oh boy. Definitely get the tiramisu and some gelato. But why stop there? Make sure you leave room
4
I was having the lunch buffet with my boyfriend at Basilico. Its our first time trying an italian buffet and there were quite a good variety available - different sections for salads, cheese, bread, hot food. I thought the octopus stew and eggplant tasted overcooked. I liked the seabass. there were also some interesting dishes like truffles risotto.. The waiters were polite and attentive and the restaurant had a nice ambience. It was a good dining experience
4
It was a great and awesome dinner at Basilico for my family after the graduation ceremony of our daughter Denise. She graduated from LaSalle College of Arts in Animation and of course I wanted it to be a special dinner and celebration for the whole family. Denise actually requested that we eat at Basilico again, we went here for the first time in our wedding anniversary and the children liked it a lot! We liked the buffet appetizer and dessert and the main dish - fish and beef

Great ambience. Attentive and prompt service. Very good spread of bread, cheese, meats, cakes, ice-cream. My family went there for a birthday dinner and they surprised us with two small cakes for celebration. Much appreciated.
4
All the food was nicely prepared and have lots of selection as well. Excellent dessert. However i wish there are more special selection on the gelatos.
Will definitely go back again
5
Amazing service, great variety of food, smorgasbord of cheeses. Pan-seared foie gras was great. And did I mention the cheeses? Oh my.
4
Dropped by this restaurant for breakfast, and I completely loved the spread.
The ambience is great though I wouldn't really call it a child friendly place.
4
Each time when I dine at Basilico, I am never disappointed.
The Varied appetizers are excellent and the main buffet courses over the weekend are really of good quality.
4
the buffet is good also
you can see the open kitchen
good choice of wine
ambiance is great
the service is very good
5
Have visited twice with different friends. Very good selection, super quality of food, private and discreet atmosphere, beautiful and tasty interior. Good selection of vines a bit pricy but worth it. No queues, mature clients. Highly recommend will visit again.
3
I'm used to hotel brunch buffets in India and China and compared to that this was good but a bit less extensive than I was used to. The food is ok overall but the cheese room is awesome. Especially the fresh pasta they drop into a massive block of cheese and top w truffle oil.
3
We lived in the Regent Singapore and ,dined in Basilico each morning for buffet breakfast. The food served there were fresh enough but I hoped things would have changed a bit each day. The only downs of the restaurant was that local Singapore and Malaysian styled foods were not served in the restaurant, including Laksa and Hainan Chicken Noodles. The service was not so good as they did not proactively assist us, and were arrogant. Upon our second day they even forgotten to serve a cup for a table of 4, lacking the good quality service. The ambience was nice but the refilling tea device was problematic as it frequently spills water out to the table. Overall, an average buffet breakfast served in this Italian restaurant.
4
I went for the lunch buffet with a friend and the spread was fantastic. They also give you an a la carte (menu card) option if you don't want the buffet. But the spread is tempting. Antipasti, starters, salads, pastas, baked mains, deserts, oh man! Food orgy. But too little time. If the buffet was open till 5 I could have done more justice. As it is, I was barely able to taste everything, and I was full. The drinks were good too. Did I mention the CHEESE? Fantastic stuff. But so not enough time to do all the eating and tasting I wanted to do. Definitely recommend this place, the service here is always top notch. Excellent staff. A delight to be here. Slightly kid in a candy store feeling if you love food. They also have a local selection of 5 things if someone in your group prefers Singaporean-Chinese food
5
The food is good and service is excellent. The appetizer buffet is huge but lack of explanation on how to mix and match them. The main course is perfect. And the dessert bar had very good ice cream. Very worthy.
5
When you have Italian guests who are home sick for the real deal, this is the place to bring them. None of those crappy pseudo pizza or pasta joints, there will be something here that will make each of your Italian guest cry... whether they are from the north of south, they will find something to remember from home. This is the ultimate cure for those who yearn for freshly prepared, unadulterated Italian cuisine
4
We have been here a few times over the past year. Each time has been good. A wide selection of hard cheeses although I like a nice blue cheese. If you ask the head chef for blue cheese they are obliging. The salads and antipasti are to die for. The bread are some of the softest I have ever experienced. Some areas for improvement are the time to first pour, it usually takes 20 minutes before you can ask three people for a drink. Overall for a Saturday brunch the selection is very good for price.
5
The food at Basilico was incredible. Not only looks great and delicious, taste-wise was also a spectacular experience. The ambience makes any shy person hungry and please, do not be shy when filling your plate(s) with gorgeous food that looks great on any mobile phone food-pix.The staff were also very friendly and helpful. An unforgettable experience. By the way The Regent is also a really nice cosy hotel, neatly tucked away at a corner of less populated Orchard Road, yet still very convenient to get to the Orchard shopping belt
3
A colleague organised dinner for a number of us at Basilico recently. First time for all of the group of 6.Overall, it was ok but not exceptional. We wanted some Italian but the Italian influence was quite light. We selected the semi buffet to get some variety. Entrees were nice with cold meats, cheese, salads and other options. Mains were dominated by grilled meats and seafoods with a few pasta options.Dessert buffet was definitely the highlight of the evening.Passabl
5
Great food, classy ambience, and good service do not come cheap - and it shouldn't! Sometimes it's worth it just to treat yourself. Basilico is a classic restaurant that has great antipasti, a cheese room (who's ever seen a cheese room in a buffet?) and fresh seafood. Of course you need to have an appreciation for rich food like this - I find it odd to see less than stellar reviews about the food as I've never had any problems with the place. My wallet's the only thing that hurts, but it's worth it once in a while
5
Finest quality ingredients, wonderful atmosphere and service. A truly beautiful experience. Perfect for cheese and antipasti lovers! If available, I would recommend the truffle tagliatelle - easily one of the most complete dishes I have tasted in Singapore and really no different to eating in Italy. A must!
4
Went to sunday brunch yesterday for the 2nd time with family. Well, my first time review this resto. Overall is good but not excellent. If i compare to any brunch around Singapore, this is the 2nd best. The strong parts: ambience, a lot of variety, sound like seafood party, cheese special space, plenty of fruits and juices, delicious dessert and good services.The weekness parts: seafood was not fresh as i expected, price a little bit over the top compare with the quality you gonna get. And i didn't like the chair lol. But If any occasion to do brunch again, i will come back again. But absolutely not my best choice.

Walk through the doors of the Four Seasons Hotel and you are surrounded by acres of marble, enormous displays of orchids. From that moment, you meet staff who are congenial, helpful, professional and well-organised. From the moment you are welcomed into the Basilico Restaurant, it is more of the same. We were invited to have a buffet dinner, but with an à la carte main course. Which suited all four of us. Our main courses were perfect. The range of food on the buffet was expansive, … so many types of cheeses, cold meats, dips, breads, fruit, seafood. The range of desserts was also extensive: the crème brulée (traditional or one heavy with coffee) and the bread-and-butter pudding with cranberries were made in heaven. Everything was beautifully organized. We had a waiter named Sherwin, ever observant, discretely efficient, very congenial. Oxymoronically, while the meal was perfect, the professionalism of the staff was even better
3
A business breakfast shouldn't cost this much ($40pp). The buffet food was good but not great, and there was a good selection of juices. Even though I wasn't paying, I couldn't help feeling ripped off. This was no better nor worse than you would expect in any 5 star hotel in Singapore.
5
A wonderful beginning of the day. Nicely decorated, clean and providing tip top services. Friendly and staff were so alert to fulfill your needs. Giving us a wondering and relaxing beginning of the day. Definately Worth for value and looking forward to visit again.
5
consistency good quality food with delightful service.
I misplaced my phone and when I came back to look for it, they had already put it at the front waiting for me to come and get it:)
4
This place is a definite re-do. We loved the delicious buffet + entre prix fix concept. Location and ambiance was fantastic
5
One of the best buffet in Singapore.super classy dining area and Food array was of excellent quality. So much varieties to choose from to soothe your taste buds and the restaurant ambience is super cozy.
5
Pretty nice cold cuts and cheeses at the buffet style appetizers bar. A bit on the pricey side but the quality is up there.
3
This being a return visit for us to the restaurant after some time, we found that they have kept their food and service quality unchanged! That was what really won us over the first time round (besides being a huge fan of Italian cuisine that is..
5
I struggle with these two major problems when I dine at this restaurant. I have had several lunches here and these issues have always been something I needed to deal with.1. The food. How do I start? Literally, the choices are all so great that I always struggle with what to eat, how much to eat, and how do I deal with my pleasurable guilt feelings afterwards. Really, can someone advise me on how I can? I feel the vast spread of choices (Western (spec Italian and Mediterranean), Asian (Chinese, some Japanese) and the dessert table makes even the most complex multi-criteria analysis tool inadequate.2. My weight. Darn.I strongly recommend this experience to foodies
5
Stunning range of high quality dishes. Even the more conventional Italian dishes tasted amazing. Cheese room is worth visiting, even if you don't like cheese. The free flow champers was plentiful and also good quality. Pricey, but if you appreciate good food, it's well worth it

So yummy, everything served at this restaurant is top quality, and so delicious. The melon in particular (which goes together with a broad selection of charcuterie) is excellent. The restaurant also serves a small quantity of local cuisine at lunch which can be a welcome respite for those who are overwhelmed by the western selection

Took my family back after a long break since last visit. The semi-buffet option makes it different from other Italian restaurants, and the spread was passable with nothing to really wow one. My son and I had the lamb shank which were soaked in sauce. The other mains were ok at best. The dessert spread was more interesting. Wine prices were on the high side. We were seated near the pasta station and the chefs were making noises with their pans. Altogether, not a great experience. Will not be heading back for a long while, if at all
3
Nice selection of food with normal atmosphere . Can be better if they have extra ordinary service. will prefer to visit one more time to explore more.
5
Basilico will surely satisfy your cravings for Italian food. A good spread of cold cuts, cheese and meat. Make your own cheese platter and top it with their very own truffle honey!
5
This was one of the best dining experiences I had with excellent service characterised by immaculate attentiveness. The spread of cheeses and antipasti was great.
The main course of sea bass was not bad but a little dry. Tenderloin is cooked to perfection of medium.
4
Had multiple breakfasts and dinner here. Food was good, service staff were friendly. option of buffet for dinner where you could just chose appetizers and dessert was great.
3
We did the Sunday wine brunch. Although we had a good time there are several hotels in Singapore who offer better wine/champagne brunches. I didn't think the selection of food at Basilico was wide enough. I also didn't think the service was anything to brag about - you actually had to call out to the waiters to get them to top up your glass. For the price you pay for the all you can eat brunch I would expect more variety of food, and way better servic
4
This place is great for an above average experience. No way it's top 3 steakhouse in town. My ribeye reminded me of something I would have gotten at Sizzler in the United States. My friends ribeye the same and my other friends filet was simply above average.Service was excellent as was the wine selection. If you are looking for an above average experience this is it, if not, more of a 5 star experience then go elsewhere.
4
Great Brunch and Great Service.Could have done with a wider range of seafood and japanese foods.Asked on reservation for a table at the window, which was arranged. Cheese room is a highlight of the venue (as is the Perrier Jouet Champagne :-))Great all roun
4
Went for dinner and loved the antipasti selection of cheese , breads, olives and cold cut meat. The mains were sub par though. The lamb chops were bit salty and the pan seared sea bass came with a potato mash and dried tomato paste which didn't go well with it.The pudding and gelato ice creams in the dessert section were quite good. We have had way better tiramisu elsewhere. Overall a solid 4/5, go there if you like Italian fare.
3
Dinner is semi buffet style. Main course, appetizers and desserts were decent. The waiters were very polite, however we were told by the waiter that the coffee/tea were part of the buffet but we were being charged. Not wanting to make a scene, we paid and left. Subsequently, I emailed the restaurant manager to complain and he agreed to refund me for the tea. I told him to donate the amount to his choice of charity instead. He thanked me but didn't follow up whether he really did donate that amount

Our eldest daughter lives in Singapore and booked the Sunday brunch with champagne when we visited with our second daughter who had turned 21 a few days earlier. What a fantastic experience! The hotel is opulent, the service was friendly and precise and the food fabulous. At around Â£100 each it's not cheap but you get 4 hours of unlimited access to an amazing hot and cold buffet with a separate cheese room, unbelievable desserts and champagne! Our glasses were never empty, the chefs replenished the platters constantly and were happy to prepare alternatives for us - a veg ravioli in place of the beef one they were cooking fresh and a selection of nut free desserts. A wonderful experience
5
I went to Basilico with my sisters. We were totally sold. We are spoilt by the choices and everything is delicious and beautifully spread out. Pasta, pizzas, lots of meats, Fresh cheese and salads. Even an asian food corner. Don't miss the desert too!
5
We come here often for the Sunday brunch. For me this is the best Sunday brunch in Singapore. With all I need and an extra cheese room.
4
it's rare to find quality in both food and service in Singapore. Restaurants like Basilico are the reasons why we go back...
5
We love the quality of food and the service here. Appetizers and dessert are from the buffet. Lots of cheeses, hams and fresh greens. Tiramisu and gelato are our favourites. Mains from a selected menu with accompanying wines. Love it.
5
Love the Sunday brunch here! We were a group of 14 friends, and everyone had a great time. Foie gras live station and the cold seafood was a huge hit. I love the cheese room, it has a truffle risotto live station there! It's great value for the quality of the food served.
5
Yet another amazing Sunday brunch at Basilico in Regent hotel, without doubt the best in Singapore at the moment. Chef Angelo Ciccone, and Luca Bicalli have the best spread of high quality Italian food including: cheeses, charcuterie, sea food, pastas, pizza, foie gras, barbecue meat, and big sweet selection. The service is impeccable too with two Italian managers. Highly recommend for the perfect Sunday
4
Went there for a birthday celebration. Pleasant experience.good spread if appetisers and desserts. Service can be further improved as the staff wasn't attentive enough.
5
To die for - I could not find a better way to describe Basilico's Sunday champagne brunch.What did my family & I not like you ask? Not one thing, and we are all Italians. The food is absolutely marvellous, great selection for all taste - cheese, fish, seafood, meet, dessert, wine. All was so fresh and the variety for each food category will keep you eating for all 3 hours! I instantly fell in love with the cheese room - yes a whole room just for cheese. My sister simply could not stop with the super fresh seafood, divine.On top of it all:- we got a table outside, overlooking the pool and it was lovely! - the ambient and decore is so classy and fresh, really welcoming. Rooms are wide which makes it perfect as it is never too loud or too crowded- the staff was so attentive and caring, my glass was never once empty and the staff was so cordialA true winning experience which will not disappoint and it will make you go back
4
I enjoyed the pastas and spaghetti at this restaurant during my stay in May 2016. The wine selection and menu selection are well thought out and would highly recommend this hotel for a dinner for two or for an anniversary dinner. The service is good, with friendly staff and responsive.Overall this restaurant also served the buffet breakfast. Location and parking facilities at the hotel makes it a convenient meeting point

I was invited to the Sunday brunch buffet at the famed Basilico Restaurant at the Regent Singapore, a Four Seasons Hotel. This award wining restaurant serves Italian food with fresh, authentic Italian ingredients on both, an a la carte and buffet option. Combining culinary excellence with clever original designs, their highlights include a rotisserie, espresso bar, walk-in wine cellar and with alfresco style-dining available at the terrace overlooking the pool. The ambiance is smart but informal. Service is hard to fault; with attentiveness, friendliness and warmth from all the staff.The food around the buffet spread looks so dazzling and delicious! I would suggest going around at least once, maybe twice, studying your food options as there are so many items to choose from and every dish looks so inviting. It’s impossible to eat everything, so you have to be very selective. There are dishes that are also vegetarian friendly. It’s also not possible to describe the many dishes, so do look at some of the pictures I took for an idea of what you can expect. For myself on this occasion, I simply had two plates servings containing the Amalfi Lemon-poached Alaskan King Crab; King Scallops; Marinated Tiger Prawns; Boston Lobsters; and the Spiny Lobsters. This was followed by a small slice each of Roasted Wagyu Beef Rump with Truffle; Mustard Amarone Wine-braised Crispy Roasted Pork Belly, with a couple of slices of their gorgeous bread. I then went for several helpings of their delicious home-made gelato. Every Wednesday night from now till December this year, is a night dedicated to ladies. The Restaurant is located on the second floor of the Regent Hotel on 1 Cuscaden Road, Tanglin. Prices for the buffet will be above a hundred dollars per person, more if you choose to include wine or champagne. It’s a place you can go to for business meetings or just for a relaxed casual meal, taking your time savoring everything that’s around you. There’s a kid’s room where the younger diners can occupy themselves, and there are private rooms as well. An expensive but worthwhile experience if you want to give yourself a treat!Operating hours are: Mon - Sat: 6:30 -10:30am, 12:00 - 2:30pm, 6:30 -10:00pm Sun: 7:00 -10:30am, 12:00 - 3:00pm, 6:30 -10:00pm.Call +65 6725 3232 for a reservation, or book on-line from their web site

Lovely ambience and not noisy like most of the other places. Good quality food and it is always a joy to go there
4
2nd visit, pricey, but worth it. Attentive service. Very authentic anti pasta. Make sure you leave room for the cheeses!
5
Just beautiful and delicious, love all the choices and especially love the cheese room. The service was perfect and attentive.
5
Four four years, now, we've been going to Basilico for special occasions like birthdays and anniversaries. Always excellent.
5
I am simply never disappointed whenever we come here ... so we keep coming over and over again. Food is terrific and options plentiful. Worth every penny.
5
Great service, fantastic ambience, awesome food.
A good place to catch up with friends or to have business lunches.
The attention to details by the staff is phenomenal.
Highly recommend!

I've lost count of the number of times I've dined, lunched or brunched at Basilico. Today I was around the area and when faced with so many options and discounts I had a craving for a meal there again. Never mind I was alone that day...Umm full concentration on the delectable food. Of course Sunday brunch is just sublime but lunch is so very good here too and the service is always wonderful. This time someone brought me a scoop of their fabulous pistachio gelato drizzled with olive oil and a sprinkling of sea salt all the way from the kitchen downstairs because it wasn't on the regular spread. So many great lovely dishes in the appetisers, main courses n desserts, and the best gelato and Italian cheeses. I will leave you to find our for yourself. I prefer the cozy ambience in the side rooms but today I sat in the main dining room cos I booked late, perfect for people-watching and they were so sweet to call and ask if they could put me there because there were a few big groups wanting the side rooms. Wonderful as always!!
5
We went to Basilico for the Sunday brunch. it was really long time that i didn't have such a tasty brunch. Exceptional hospitality (Italian Manger of course), the food was 90% Italian. They ad all the type of cheese and the biggest choice of mozzarella ever. Wagyu beef on the meet side, home made ravioli and lobster, crab like crazy. Champagne and wine to complete the experience. coffee and grappa to complete the wonderful brunch.really suggeste
4
If you love authentic Italian fare in Singapore and crave for an all-you-can-eat buffet, lunch at Basilico can't be far wrong. Their appetizer station of salads, parma ham, cold cuts, breads, cheeses with their selection of very good quality olive oils and balsamic vinegars is the one that I love the most. The meats and pizzas station are impressive too. Their Asian spread is a tad disappointing as their fusion cooking made the dishes neither here nor there. Desserts are a nice end to this meal with good quality tiramisu and gelatos. Service is prompt and friendly. If you love alcohol, add on their Prosecco/wines free flow too. That completes a wonderful Italian lunch for the family. Bon appetit
5
So we reserved a table online and was there I think 15 mins earlier but had a table ready for us already. The food was great. Unlike the typical hotel buffet, the choices may seem limited (only when compared to other 5-star hotel buffet spreads) BUT the quality of the food more than makes up for it. The steak was great, there was a cheese area where I think it was some kind of parmesan that my husband snacked on a lot, I have several servings of creme brulee and tiramisu, and a few other dishes that I don't remember the name but the memory of enjoying them is still there. The staff is also friendly. The only thing that I didn't enjoy was the mango gelato. It was a bit sour-y for me (I'm used to Philippine mangoes which tend to be sweet)
5
Best Italian buffet in Singapore and my go to for top notch service, food and ambience!
Went there for a birthday celebration this year and the staff did well at making it a special occasion for us all.
4
We went for Saturday Lunch. We were a bit late but we were still accommodated, which was a good thing. Wished there was risotto, as there was none. Food was pretty good, and the desserts (especially the sorbets) were yummy!
5
Everything from appetisers to mains to desserts were yummy! Service was very attentive too, despite being a buffet. We will definitely return very soon
5
Picked this place as we were looking for an Italian and was highly rated by TripAdvisor.All indications implied this was a buffet and that was confirmed when we asked as we were booking.It was a big surprise to find out that it was a semi-buffet, appetizer and dessert and you choose your main from a list of about a dozen items.My wife skipped the main as the tenderloin was not available, my son skipped the main as everything was too fancy. Myself and daughter we took the rib-eye (substituted the tenderloin).We all attacked the buffet which I ahem to admit was amazing. I love burrata and was happy to see it on the buffet, along with smoked mozzarella, many other cheeses, salamis, hams, olives (must have been 10 types), artichokes and salad galore.I regretted ordering a main course as it was so good.The chef came out to say hi and check up on things and he offered to make a special pasta for my son who ordered a penne bolognese. He was not disappointed, it was THE BEST he says he's ever had, which is something since he is soooo picky.The mains (rib-eye) was a bit superfluous, but was delicious anyway.Desserts were a struggle and also a bit OTT, you really did not need them.All in all a very enjoyable meal!We'll be coming back again
3
Basilico's reputation for good italian food is a well-deserved one. The semi-buffet & our ala carte order of a pasta met our expectations. What fell below expectations was the main course of scallops which I found a tad too springy for my liking.If the generous serving of the pasta is standard, then three orders should be sufficient for four persons; unless you are famished.The servers were pleasant and helpful but their attentiveness was found wanting. We had to asked a number of times for our water glasses to be refilledThough the ambiance was very nice, the service and the scallops downgraded my overall rating of this restaurant
3
Overall I generally enjoy going to Basilico, it's one of my favorite lunch restaurants for their delectable buffet bar of marinated & pickled goodies, hams, salads & cheese selection. This is the first time I opted for the al a carte menu & was delivered a plate that had fine black pepper all around the rim that was added, it seemed to me, for presentation's sake. I don't like to eat pepper so worked carefully not to get the pepper on my food as I ate, until I turned my fish over to find it had pepper on it from the under-side. I was rather disappointed. I would have preferred to be asked if I wanted pepper, I'm a purist when it comes to seafood, no need for anything but the perfect taste of the fish. This really was the only spoiler, otherwise everything was as good as always. I'm a little deterred by the price of a simple fish & green bean meal, $32 for lunch is rather steep in my books but otherwise, again, everything else was fine

We visited Basilico to celebrate fiancee's birthday through the recommendation of our friends. The buffet was divine! i love the selection of cheese, burrata, cold cuts, beef, pizzas, pasta and desserts! Thank you to Sherwin who took care of us. The Manager Andy who surprised us with Chef's special of the day. I love the team from the hostess who assisted us, the chefs and the wait staffs all wearing their best smiles! Warm service and We bith are delighted thank you! see you soon
5
We went for Champagne Brunch (must be a special occasion as it is $150++!) and it was genuinely the most delicious food and champagne I've had in a long time!Good selection of vegetarian dishes (this is why we selected Basilico) and amazingly helpful staff.I would recommend this place to anyone for any occasion (as long as you can afford it!). Will be visiting again as soon as there is a reason to
5
My team and I had the pleasure to attend the cooking class at Basilico last Thursday and we had an extraordinary time. Everything was organized to perfection and the staff could not have been more attentive.We were greeted at the door of the hotel and escorted to the restaurant which already makes you feel special.Chef Luca did a fantastic job to capture us and take us on the journey of Italian Cuisine. He has a very delightful way to make the group feel comfortable and less intimidated. I recommend to chose 3 classic dishes of Italian Cuisine before your course. We went for Pizza, Orecchiette and Risotto. Chef Luca provided us the great insight into the basic recipes one can use at home.Apart from Chef Luca and John who did an outstanding job, everyone took such good care of us: F&B Director Alessandro was always in reach and joined us to see if we’re all happy and satisfied. We met the Executive Chef and many more colleagues from Basilico which made us all feel very special indeed.The preparation and logistics of the class were very well done as well. We appreciated the Apron, hat and recipe book a lot and took away lovely memories from the night. Everything we didn’t managed to eat was packed very nicely for us. All in all a very special and well organized experience
4
An excellent restaurant generally with a good spread. We were a group of 9 dining, celebrating a birthday. Disappointed by the long long wait - 45min at least - for one of the dinner dishes. The pasta main dish was served to my nephew so late, everyone couldn't wait and finished their mains! A rarity in our past experience with this restaurant. Good quality Italian food
4
Decent Italian place in a very nice setting. The staff was very friendly and accommodating to our various needs but the food itself was average barring the burrata which was excellent.
5
Overall ... Good value for money Sunday brunch , foie gras is good. Seafood is very fresh. Extensive selection of cheese n cold cuts.
5
Great Italian themed buffet. Service great, food offering and quality really 5-star. Can't recall the last time I enjoyed my buffet so much!
4
I always love going to Basilico; great service by very attentive and friendly staff. The food is great with the main course portions sufficient in size. I would recommend providing some lighter mains though. The restaurant used to have a bouillabaisse which was a great option if you did want to go a bit lighter at a buffet (i know...it's a bit contradictory).The main courses change every now and then which is great. But I think it's also time to change up the buffet. After going a few times you just get bored with the same spread. My dining partner had the same feeling.As for desserts, they are good, but not the spread like other buffets
5
Came here for dinner during a weekend staycation with my wife. Had the White Asparagus menu at $88++. We both chose the Guinea Fowl. First off, the menu is a fantastic deal as you get the all-you-can-eat appetizer and dessert, which has a wonderful selection. The service here is discreet, polite and attentive. Atmosphere is a bit noisy (it is a buffet after all) but still intimate enough for conversation. Overall a great experience. Stuffed full of good food
5
there's a fantastic cheese and ham section, beautiful bread, hot dishes, pasta, salad station and dessert! the must tries are Parma ham and melon, tomato pizza near the bread section, all of the cheese, octopus salad, cold Pork salad, prosuto ham, tomato shell pasta, mash potato, roast beef, creme brûlée , tiramisu , bread pudding,sherbet, choc cake! yums
5
The Trip Advisor rating for the restaurant helped us select it. Setting in a luxury hotel and the view from the restaurant was great. There were set dinner options which appeared very good and reasonable but we decided to go al a carte mainly because the group was not keen on big desert potions.While we were soaking in the ambience and browsing the menu our server Mote Carlo introduced him self. We immediately took to him for his pleasant manners and charming demeanour. He unobtrusively helped us select a lovely italian wine and we settled for steak, lamb shanks, salmon respectively for each one of us. The servings turned out reasonable and the lamb shanks and the steak were done to excellent med rare. As it turned out Monte Carlo told that he was named so because his father was fond of gambling, and he insisted that he is not making this up. I forgot the desert since it was forgettable. We attributed this to ordering the same when Monte Carlo was busy elsewhere and did not advise us. All in all a very pleasant evening and will recommend strongly

Here I am for lunch thinking to treat myself before a business meeting. Service is friendly and accurate. Great view over the pool. A little too noisy but overall great vibe. Here comes my food. I feel my mouth salivating and ready to dig into that bowl. The Raviolacci with ricotta and spinach filling - which I haven't had in a while - are staring at me just waiting to be bitten into. The presentation is ok but nothing special. I lift my fork, bring it to my open mouth and the taste is absolutely..DISAPPOINTING. While I realize that having lived in Italy a good portion of my life makes me a discerning customer this $30 bowl is simply not worth it's bland flavor, lack of quality parmigiana cheese (that I had to ask for) and wrong spice combination. Suggestion for the head chef: either get back cooking proper food or lower your prices big time. I will try one more time this week in the evening and let you know how it goes
3
Have always been impressed by the quality of the food and buffet spread which was the reason for the repeated patronage, but since the last visit to the place we noticed that the quality and selection of the food has dropped. The service is still exceptional but the food wasn't what we remembered, something must have changed in the operation and it shows in the quality of main course and the buffet spread, such a pity
4
Service was overall good. When the restaurant called me to confirm the reservation, they asked if we were there on a special occasion. At this they arranged a small slice of cake cos we were celebrating my mother's birthday.Overall, the lunch buffet spread has a wider variety as the mains are also buffet style, where at dinner the mains are a la carte. They have a huge selection of antipasti, cured meats, greens, cheeses... mains are alright, fish is a little over done (probably cos it's left out buffet style)... The dessert is amazing, lovely cakes, tiramisu, pana cotta, ice-creams and a perfect bread and butter pudding!Good that they validate parking too
5
The buffet was fantastic and the quality of food on offer was amazing, they had truffle honey, buffalo mozzarella and great quality parma ham. Service was absolutely incredible, definitely returning again.
4
Good food for reasonable prices. The quantity of each dish was perfect. They have a huge variety of food and drinks. The staff are really friendly and very helpful.
5
Good Buffet Spread! From the fried noodles, bacon to pastry, all are my favourite food! My parent enjoys their breakfast there! I will definitely bring them there again
5
Food is awesome, and reasonably priced. Service is excellent. When u feel cold, they have shawl, when u drop your food, they immediately came over and cleaned it up.

Let me set the scene: Mother's Day is typically a crazy-busy brunch season; every brunch in town is booked solid. I've tried all brunch places in town, but Basilico is my all-time favourite. While I was on the waitlist a week before Mother's Day, they called me daily to update me on my status and finally managed to get me and my party into the Mother's Day brunch. On the day of the brunch, we arrived and there was a small confusion, we were seated at a table for 4 and my party was 5 people. I asked to speak with David, the Italian General Manager, who I'd met at previous brunches and lunch and was always so pleased to see him go from table to table, serving people, making people feel welcomed. Well, on this occasion, he did not disappoint! I pointed out the situation and apologised as I knew how busy they were and how hectic it was to reseat and shuffle people when your venue is booked. But David, like the pro that he is, had us moved immediately and without any fuss (viola-presto!). And, he managed the situation very warmly and made us feel very welcomed. David and his Italian Chefs, who also walked the floor, from table to table, give Basilico its cutting edge (X-Factor), they infuse the place with an authentic Italian soul that comes across in every dish, impeccable service, and every smile. And since the occasion was Mother's Day, the chefs gave their guests a little box with risotto and some dried Italian mushrooms and herbs and an enclosed recipe from their Italian Mama. Simply amazing. It is by far my favourite brunch and will continue to be so
5
The quality and quantity of Basilico is excellent. They are pretty reputable and so far reviews from friends and relatives have been pretty consistent.One of the few buffets I would recommend, together with Carousel, Concorde hotel's Spice Cafe (their seafood buffet - YUM! and still quite valuable for $$
5
Their service at the door was excellent, providing a table immediately once my reservation is confirmed. The staff was very attentive to us and cleared our tables the moment we got up for more food. There wasn't an instance where our table was cluttered with plates nor once were our glasses empty.
5
A popular restaurant for the best of Italian cuisine. A wide variety of appetisers, main courses and desserts. Not cheap but good value considering what they offer and the quality of all the items. I especially like that the tables are spaced a good distance apart. Very good service too
5
Basilico is by far my favourite buffet in town . Have been there countless times and it's consistency never disappoints. Everything is delicious and beautifully spread out. Fresh cheese and salads , pasta pizzas and meats! Asian food corner ! wanderful selection! Must not miss desert
5
Great place to get your proscuitto and cheese fix. They have a great selection of cheeses including a variety of fresh mozzarella and heirloom tomatoes. A couple of great combinations include parmegiano with truffle honey and wine soaked mozzarella with proscuitto and heirloom tomatoes. Excellent food quality
5
Quality and taste of food were wonderful. Staff were very attentive and helped to make the experience such a great one.
5
Was great to have the weekday lunch buffet there. The selection was smaller than weekends but still way too large for us to try everything, and was delicious!
5
Excellent food choices, they had everything, the customer service was so professional and always on point. Dessert were to die for. Will return for either business or family outing.
5
The service staff are very friendly and provide top notch service. The food quality is of high quality. Will definitely be back.
5
Food is always excellent here. Service was not great on this particular day. Water was not filled despite asking several times. Plates were not collected promptly. But generally good experience.
5
Delicioso! Bellissimo! Gracie! Think Italiano, dine in Basilico! Every dish we tried was delicioso, oishi, ho chiak, sedap, shiok & naler ireker. Die die must try. Dont just come alone but bring along somebody or many 'bodies'. Every waitron has passion & serve you with the best you can get. Ambience is another vital factor to good dining, & here is the best of best. To every staff working here ... Nandre, Shukriya, Arigato, Kamsa Hamida, Xie Xie, Kam Siah, Tor Cheh, Terima Kasih, Salamat Po, Cam O'n, Karp Khun, Chei Zu Bar, Danker, Merci, Gracias & Thank You
5
We were guests at lunch. Over two hours of a diverse conversation covering religion, politics, climate change, meditation, Bohemian Club and lots more we tucked in great Italian food - appetizers, mains and cheese platter, ending with great espresso - much served at the table and chosen from the spread. The chefs were busy replenishing as it disappeared
5
Having a great diner with friends. The welcome lady is very professional. The antipadti buffet with quality product and well presented. Really a great chef all the menu are well prepared great taste..We are all 3 friends executive chefs and wr really enjoyed our evening..Plz keep the standard its really grea
5
The staff were very well-trained and attentive, gave us recommendations but also knew how to leave us alone accordingly. Food was superb, I had the cod fish fillet which was delicate and the quantity was just right. Wine was perfect. The apple crumble was a 7/10 so that's okay too. It was just a bit noisy because there were many patrons.
4
There were 3 types of burrata and 2 diff mozzarella and a wide range of anti pasti, service was good despite the crowd, a balloonist came round to entertain the kids and the separate kids room helped to entertain them for the rest of the afternoon, will def go back again
5
I brought my love ones and good friends this time and all of them enjoyed the experience a lot. They too want to bring their friends here. The service is top notch. Food is good too!
4
I have ordered grilled sea bass and octopus for main, it was slightly overcooked. However, the appetizers and desserts have compensated it.
5
love the place, excellent food, stunning service, great drinks. I will have to head back there again!
4
nice place very claen and food was good pizza and pasta tasty and staff attentive and friendli i love italian food
5
We were taken very good care of by the staff who made sure we were comfortable and even offered to prepare dishes to suit our taste (we asked for a more spice in our food).
4
Located on the 2nd floor of Regent Hotel along Tanglin Road, Basilico is a fine dining establishment with good Italian food. There are Italian chefs. There is a choice of buffet or ala carte. We had a main course and ala carte. They have good pasta as well. Prices are around 35+ per dish. Large selection of wine as well. Nice ambience, dimly lit with candlelight
5
Had a small celebration dinner with my family at Basiico during the recent Restaurant Week. The restaurant is located at Regent Hotel along Cuscaden Road, just outside the busy Orchard Road.The concept was quite interesting to me - basically you get to choose a main course, and then you help yourself to a wide variety of Italian sides at their buffet spread. I had the steak as my main course - which was done just right for my taste :)The buffet offered many different types of salads, cheese, bread, cold meats, sea food, desserts, ice cream etc. You've got to see and try it to understand - it will take too much time and space to describe such a wide variety...and in Italian. On the whole, the quality was excellent, and the only limit is your stomach size.The service provide was also excellent - very attentive, friendly - always with a smile :) My wife and daughter ordered the Sea Bass for mains, but shortly after that the waitress approached them apologetically to say that the kitchen had run out of Sea Bass. So we asked her what else could they offer. She disappeared for awhile into the kitchen and reappeared to ask if Cod Fish would be OK although it was not on the menu that night (for Restaurant Week). We agreed and it turned out to be super delicious! To add to the pleasure, the chef himself came out towards the end of our dinner to apologise again about the Sea Bass, and asked if the Cod was alright!All in all, it was a great experience, and I would personally recommend this restaurant!By the way, I you drive and park in the hotel carpark, don't forget to ask the restaurant staff for a complimentary parking ticket
5
Superb Our breakfasts there were amazing for four days in a row... so many kitchens to try and experience. But if your too traditional and don’t want to try something new - you‘ll definitely find your home made food also. It was a shame we were always out on a stroll around Singapore and had no chance to dine there.The staff is very helpful, do not poke around to much if you prefer privacy.

Basilica is certainly among the best 3 Italian restaurants in Singapore.Food and service were perfect (Astonishing dessert spread!)While I would normally rate this pre-ordered birthday dinner arrangement a 9+,I must add that we were a little bit disappointed that the bottle of French Champagne we ordered for the birthday toast was NOT chilled and had to be put in an ice bucket for 30 minutes.This is the more amazing as this was one of the "bubbles" on the "per glass" wine list.Probably an oversight, but then, for a 5***** star....

I have been here a couple of times for lunch but this was the first time I arrived for the dinner semi buffet, and it was during restaurant week. The appetizers featuring various types of cold cuts, condiments and the assorted bread were yummy. I was expecting the squid ink bread to make its appearance but it wasn't available. I had the tenderloin for the main which I found a tad dry. Nonetheless, the side vegetables were delicious.The desserts were excellent especially the gelato. Staffs were helpful, friendly and accommodating too. I feedback-ed about the long wait for the yummy tomato pizza that took over an hour to be replenished (not sure why...) and the situation was handled swiftly and professionally. Was offered a Limoncello and some pizza slices for takeaway which left me surprised and touched! The night was well spent with a recommended bottle of Chianti Classico as well

Great food and wine. Great value for a buffet dinner in Singapore. We love Basilico at the Regent Hotel!
5
Quality food with nice selection of appetizers and desserts. The ice cream and sorbets are the best. Service was excellent with friendly and attentive staff. We enjoyed the experience and will come back next time.
5
Probably the best Italian Brunch in SIngapore. Great food and pretty aunthentic italian experience. Only thing missing was Mama. Great food at equally good prices for what its worth. DO save space for the desserts!!
5
Great quality products, in a classy environment and top notch service. A must do for residents and visitors

Very prompt and attentive service. Food quality was mediocre especially the pasta dishes. Desserts were wonderful.
5

We visited for a family Birthday on a Saturday.I'd never had a Saturday brunch before, and have to say I'm not sure why, it makes so much sense, starts the weekend of well, and if it's going to be a boozy free flow one you have Sunday to recover.Basillico is very very good, service was excellent, we asked to change tables when we arrived as we felt we were a little "out of it", and the change was facilitated very well the Staff were extremely attentive, and we were even asked if we were celebrating a special occasion (which we were), so that was a fairly unique, nice, touch.Food range was very good, especially if you're brining teenagers as the choice is very wide, pasta, potatoes, nice breads, plenty of meat and fish, plus excellent desserts, plenty of choice for everyone.We really enjoyed ourselves, and I have no doubt we will visit Basillico again

Celebrated my husband's bday at Basilico. We were there for the lunch buffet many years ago and always remembered the pasta counter where you could choose the way you like youe pasta cooked and the free flow parma ham with rock melon. We weren't disappointed this visit. The parma ham and rock melon were still great. However the pasta counter looked different, the pasta were precooked. Nevertheless we tried our luck and tried ordering an aglio oglio, the chef was obliging and prepared a bowl on the spot. The wide array of appetizers including mozzerella cheese and breads were impressive. There were other international cooked food which you could give a miss. I was too stuffed for desserts but the gelato selection looked great. They also gave us a complimentary slice of cake to celebrate my husband's birthday. Will definitely return
5
Great service from the start to the end. Hospitality was so good that I practically left the restaurant smiling. Servers took pride in their job and they paid attention to the smallest detail. It was the first time ever that we were asked if we are celebrating any occasion, and I must admit that was a nice touch. We were served by Jennylene, and she's one of the best server we've ever met. Great smile, great attention given to make your dinner so much better. Food is extremely fresh with great selection of antipasti. The main's portion is good, dishes cooked and season to the right perfection. Dessert was great with selection of pastries to sorbet. Truly satisfying
5
Food is great and ambience is great too. But best of all, service is outstanding! The waiter greets me by my name as I was the one who made the reservation. Made our visit a happy and wonderful experience!
5
One of the best value brunches in Singapore.
Large selection of excellent food, very friendly service, ...
5
A great buffet spread. Quality at a very reasonable price. Great service. Interesting architecture. Exciting wines. After multiple stays at The Regent we are yet to tire of the Basilico, which says a lot considering the dining options in Singapore!
5
Amazing food in terms of quality, selection and value. Stellar service and cosy ambience. A must for any occasion!
5
great food! great service - v prompt in clearing plates. v attentive servers. italian main course & dessert & cold dishes are delicious.
5
My husband and I managed to get a last-minute table for Saturday lunch and, this being the first time here, it certainly won't be the last. Lots to eat whether you are a sworn carnivore or a veggie. Everything we had was delicious - even pan fried beef was cooked en point.The service is the other thing to rave about. We were taken care of by Montecarlo who was very affable and professional.We have always loved our visits to The Regent and we continue to do so.Many many thanks for such a lovely start to the weekend, Basillico! Keep up the good work

I Guess everyone goes there for the buffet spread. It comes with a big reputation and is extremely popular amongst the locals. Everyone seems to think this is the best Italian fare in town. It is overpriced and has poor ambience. It is quantity over quality here. The mains very extremely poorly executed. I am stunned by uncooked risotto, with lack of seafood in it. The fish had poor seasoning with overwhelming tangy sauce. Do not bother with the mains and perhaps just have cheese and dessert.
5
Great spot for a lovely dinner, the semi-buffet idea is great value with a very generous interesting spread and fresh fresh ingredients used overall. Spent abt 850 bucks amongst 4 ppl with some wines, not cheap but good value. For a special occassion, would surely go back.
5
Celebrated my bf's birthday at Basilico. Great selection of cheeses, antipasti, pastas, grilled meats and mains.But the cherry on top of the cake was the server, Yufei. She took very good care of our table, clearing plates and topping up our drinks promptly. we enjoyed this lunch very much.
4
We went by this spot with our friends. I should say we had exclusive standards, yet none of us was disillusioned. We pick the Prosecco and Wine choice. Each of the 4 distinct Wines were awesome. We all cherished the cheddar room and the all the new fish. Incredible spot to treat yourself
5
Basilico has a great range of food, including noodles, in their daily brunch. Outstanding service makes it a pleasure. If the weather is nice, sit outside by the pool!
5
Title explains it all.
Service was superb, food is good, staff also recommended many things, was very patient.
5
Semi dinner buffet was great, was pleased with the anti pasti and dessert selection. Would have wished for more pasta selection for the main course though.
4
The food served was delicious. The pricing was reasonable with the quality of food, ambience and service. Highly recommended.
4
I really enjoyed myself with the food, excellent quality with nice setting. Will come again especially for the ham and desserts

I'm staying at the Regent as I wrote this and have dined at Basilico for many daily breakfasts, a lunch and one dinner. The most consistent thing the Basilico offers is warm staff and the related good service.Let's start with breakfast, with 6 under my belt they have a solid western spread with a range of "hot" items, eggs cooked to order and sliced meats. Hot is often not exactly the case even with the Le Creuset pots and pans - items on the hot aisle often are not.They also offer a wide variety of baked goods and my basic test is whether the chef can provide a solid croissant and Basilico passes this test with flying colors.You'll also find a nice selection of fresh sliced fruit, yogurt and spreads along with a selection of cheese, salad greens and other fixings.There is also an Asian section.Lunch is a variation of this theme but with lunch items - pasta dishes, pizza, roasted vegetables, sautÃ©ed items and a slicing station. Same issue on the temperature control unfortunately.Lunch does offer a broader selection of cheeses and salads - with a myriad of olive oils, vinegars and other mixers.Lunch offers a good selection of desserts including gelato.Dinner is either prix fixe or a la carte and can include a wine pairing. I took the prix fixe path with wine which includes an antipasto and dessert bar. My main was a beef fillet which was beautiful in appearance but overcooked and with a sauce that did not quite meet expectations. The wine was excellent which almost made up for the well done piece of beef.Anyway, this is a nice place with warm service and, in some cases, warmish food.
5
I just came from Basilico's lunch buffet with a friend for our birthdays. And I still can't stop dreaming about their food! I love this place! It's my 3rd time to dine here, but my first to try the lunch buffet. Comparing the lunch with the dinner, lunch is full buffet while dinner is semi buffet. That means that for lunch, everything is buffet spread style. But for dinner, only the appetizers and desserts are buffet spread while you order your main course from a menu. The vibe is also different. Lunch is brighter and has a friendlier atmosphere. While dinner is more intimate and is a good ambience for a date. The tables are well spaced out so even if the place is packed, you'll definitely still have privacy. In terms of food, I think the appetizers and desserts are more or less the same. But for the main dishes / course, what you find during lunch isn't available during dinner and vice versa. Which also explains the price difference as the main courses during dinner are better executed and are more fine dining type than lunch. But regardless of the differences, I enjoyed both lunch and dinner! Probably my favorite ones would be the prosciutto w/ melon (one serving really isn't enough), the mozzarella cheese paired with tomatoes (they have different types of cheese and also, different types of tomatoes), the warm apple crumble with vanilla ice cream on top (I consider that as my birthday dessert of the day) and the tiramisu (in perfect shotglass size). The main course for lunch would include pizza, pasta, roasted meats and they even have Chinese dishes which I find surprising. Didn't try the Chinese dishes though. I find generally for lunch, the choices were yummy. However, the dinner main course choices were much more sophisticated and yummier like rack of lamb, risotto, etc. I heard that the dinner menu also has some additions / changes to the menu depending on the season. Then about the staff, you just have to appreciate how well they're chosen and trained. Everyone's so professional, chatty and very attentive. You don't even need to call their attention for anything because before you think about what you need, they're already there with it. Like extra cutlery, water, clearing of plates, etc. They're amazing! So yes, definitely and absolutely, I'll come back again and will continue to recommend Basilico to my friends. I personally prefer dinner over lunch because of the main courses, but I won't say no to lunch either. Thank you, Basilico! You remain one of my favorite restaurants in Singapore!

Well known island wide for their outstanding Italian focussed Sunday Brunch, there is nothing that Basilico do not have. The antipasti selection is 1st rate and OH MY GOD if you're a fan of CHEESE you're in for a treat as they have a cheese ROOM (that's correct an entire 20ft room dedicated to cheese)!!! Basilico is also equally good for a nice quiet meal or a special dinner party in one of private dining rooms. The staff are always attentive and helpful (but then I've only ever been on weekends or Thursday/Friday nights). One of favourite places in Singapore - never have to think twice about going there, and have done so more times than I can recall.The Hotel also has a great cocktail bar across the foyer from Basilico - Manhattan is definitely worth checking out
5
If you love Italian food then this brunch is the one for you. The food is exquisite and there are three different prices - with soft drinks, with Prosecco or with champagne. There is a whole room dedicated to bread and cheese and about 10 different mozzarellas. I have been to many brunches in Singapore and this is one of the best.
4
Basilico's Sunday brunch is to die for, a feast for anyone with even the slightest love for Italian food. Must try's: marscapone pizza, aubergine parmeggiano, mozzarella station, cold cuts, gelatos, Apple crumble & cheese. Come with loose clothing, you'll need the space! Only let down was the coffee, not quite up to standard..
5
Comfortable, quiet ambience and excellent quality of food, with a really extensive spread of appetizer and dessert. Service was also impeccable.
5
We have been to Basilico on a few occasions, and it never fails to deliver top class service and food. The setting is charming and the staff attentive without being over the top.
5
The is a fantastic place for lunch or dinner. The Italian food is awesome and environment lovely. Must be best Italian in Singapore. Looking forward to next visit. Just go!!!
5
I was there with my girlfriend for a romantic dinner.
The food and service is excellent and the manager Micael need a special mention.
I never met such a professional and elegant Manager.
Way to go Micael.
I will definately come back.

My partner and I visited the restaurant on the 8th FEB for Dinner. With the raving reviews and my partner's pleasant experience dining here previously, we were both looking forward to a nice dinner to celebrate CNY. However something went wrong on so many levels I had to give this feedback, hoping improvements could be made. After being seated, we made our orders promptly as we were hungry and was planning to go out after dinner. After placing our orders, we started on the buffet and 40 minutes into it, we have already went 2 rounds with the antipasti spread and eaten what was more than enough before our mains came. We waited patiently and 50 minutes after we placed the order, I asked for our mains to be checked. No one came back and when we asked for our water to be topped up, it wasn't done promptly. 1 hour into waiting, I manage to get another server to check on the mains and she said she will come back to us but she didn't.By this time, we were angry and upset as our mains are not here after an hour, the waitress did not come back to us when she said she will after checking and they had no initiative topping up the empty water glasses after attending to us. To make matter worse, it was SO HARD to get the attention of any of the servers, including the managers! Yes we were seated at a far end, but I am big enough to be seen with my waving arms if they have placed a bit more attention on the guests!After 1 hour and 10 minutes, another waitress came back to tell us that the kitchen lost our docket and she has asked for our orders to be fired but the kitchen did not have our docket. 2 things wrong with this:1. Don't share your problem with us. We have kindly reminded you twice that our orders are not here, any experience server would have known by now that the kitchen probably didn't get the order, if any server would have paid attention to us, you would not even need us to remind you. Are you implying that its normal for guests to wait for an hour for their mains and you don't have to check with the kitchen for it?2. Don't blame it on the kitchen. It does not say well about teamwork in the restaurant/hotel. Don't blame anyone for that matter. We are not interested in whose fault it is, we are interested to know what can be done. We were told it will be here in a minute when she came back to us, but it WASN'T! It took another 15 minutes. We waited for a total of 1hour and 20minute for the mains! Service recovery was tomato soup while we were waiting for the mains. After our mains were served, they gave us an additional main as we highlighted we were very hungry; We do appreciate the kind gesture as well, but we honestly didn't feel good having our meals at that point in time as we were just so upset. With the above mentioned, please look at the processes and proper training for your staff in handling customers. Cindy who was our server was very apologetic and she made many attempts at pleasing us and we have to compliment her for the effort that she put in. This could have been prevented if more attention was given to the guests in the first place. Customers who came after us, finished their meals and left while we were still at our mains. For Cindy to handle the whole section wasn't quite enough as well, the managers float around to assist but seriously, there is a lack of service on a whole in the restaurant. Feedback on the food:Everything on the buffet was great, especially the dessert spread. My partner had the snow fish which was really good and our complimentary mains which was a mushroom risotto with truffles was also very enjoyable. The king prawns that I had is the dish that I would strongly discourage anyone to order. Prawns were a little overcooked for me and the 3 pieces of king prawns on the plate looks really sad. It is a fail for me on the taste and presentation.Feedback on the service:1. Please do not ask questions like, "Would you like more water?" when our glasses are empty. Some initiative to top up the water without us signalling for it more than 5 times over dinner will be something a normal restaurant would do. 2. When ordering, we were asked if we would like any wine with our orders. We said no and told the server that we have plans for drinks after our dinner and would not be having any during our meal. He heard it but no one else did, cause we had to reject another server and also the manager who came by AGAIN, to ask if we wanted any wine. Communication amongst the service staff could be better?3. When the guests stands up to help themselves at the buffet, it will be nice if the servers could go ahead and clear our tables from the previous round of food that we had. Our tables were never cleared when we return from the buffet and we end up stacking the used plates and putting it by the side ourselves. Not acceptable with the lack of initiative and attentiveness.I admit my expectations might have been too much but I am writing this as it is not impossible to achieve, especially for such a renowned restaurant like Basilico. Our dinner was value for money but with that price, there are also other choices that could provide food and service that are equally good. I will not discourage anyone from visiting this restaurant but I would highly recommend that you ask for a table that is in the middle of the restaurant or near the buffet spread. Service is so much more prompt when you can be easily seen. There is also nothing romantic about the restaurant, if you are looking at some nice quiet time with your other half. It was crowded, busy and tables are close to one another. More importantly, my partner and I, who were just looking for a good dinner on the first day of Lunar New Year, didn't get that. We felt lousy and it really wasn't a good feeling to have for our first dinner in the new lunar year
5
It doesn't get better than having great service, great ambiance, authentic food, and homemade pasta. A restaurant that gives me a little "touch of Italy". If you are looking for a good place to have the real Italian touch, Basilico comes highly recommended. The prices tag is on the high side, but it is similar to other Italian eateries along the Orchard belt but the quality of the food is probably one of my favourites in Singapore. All the food we ate was delicious; the place is Comfortable, quiet ambience and the Service was also impeccable. This place will be a regular for us. It was a treat!! Thank you for more than a touch of stylish Italian hospitality in Singapore
5
Probably one if not the Best Italian restaurant in Singapore.Amazing antipasti selection with cheeses to die for... the squid ink burrata its a must try for the fine palate.The manager its always very accommodating and the Chef Angelo does make sure you have a memorable experience, he was very understanding with special requirements of my guests.The only flaw the temperature of the restaurant was to cold for my liking, but beside that beautiful dinner with great food
4
I always have buffet lunches at Basilico. I brought my family here for my birthday lunch and they truly enjoyed it. There was something for everyone - amazing roast beef, fresh salads, pasta etc. If your family has very diverse taste buds and can't agree on a single item to eat, this will be a great place to bring them to.The pasta and lasagna station is one of my favourite places to hit and it never disappoints! Rich, creamy and tasty! I also love the dessert station that has a wide variety of desserts including creme brulee, panna cotta, tiramisu, gelato etc.It can be a bit on the pricey side for a buffet lunch as it came to about $80sgd per person after including service charge and tax. But the spread was amazing and I'll definitely be back again
5
We have always had buffet lunch at Basilico and because it was my husband's birthday last tuesday we decided to have dinner there instead. Superb service from the time we sat down to we left 4 hours later! The appetisers were as fresh and nicely displayed as we recalled and main courses were delicious too! Only let down was the mojito that was served had mint syrup instead of proper mint leaves. We had the pigeon and snow fish for mains and they were perfectly cooked. Service is immaculate and we will definitely be back. We had a wonderful corner table as requested too!
4
Tables to close to each other. Not enough privacy. Atleast not on my table when I made it for a bday surprise.
4
Certainly one of my favorite places; go for the antipasti and dessert buffet. They offer good quality cheese, oils, etc. Entrees are excellent. Good value for money and will not disappoint.
5
We loved our daily breakfast here whilst staying at the Regent. Nice atmosphere, attentive service and a great selection and quality of food for all tastes and cultures.
5
The food was excellent and with a wide variety of cuisine. The desserts are superb too. The waitresses did a very good job of managing our mains and buffet.
5
Perfect place to gather for a nice meal. Food was great and well done. Staff are very attentive and informative.
5
We have been to Brasilico a few times for dinner and out friend returned from NYC so thought we have a catch up. Greeted by the host and seated with a small stool for my handbag. Water and coffee is served as we make our way to the buffet line. Food presentation is perfect, enticing and clean. The cold starters are a big hit, all assortment of cheese and freah seafood. The hot food is freshly prepared as there are 3-4 chefs manning the stations. Desserts to follow and it offers a great variety! Too good! I will definitely recommend this place.
4
A friend recommended Basilico to us after having a hard time finding a Sunday Brunch over the Christmas holiday. They accepted a reservation on short notice but I would recommend calling at least a couple days in advance. The buffet was a tribute to Italian cooking with pastas, pizzas, various Italian meats, etc. A true highlight was the cheese bar with a selection encompassing most Italian regional cheeses. Cost was reasonable for an all you can eat brunch with free flow Prosecco.
5
This is a great place for italian, with a nice selection of main courses, and the best part is the salad buffet, which has many many selections, such as hams, meats and different vegetables. It has a nice selection of desserts for the buffet too ! You will not go hungry here
5
I surprised my husband with the free flow prosecco brunch. Before we went, all we heard was amazing recommendations from friends! We were so excited and not let down for a moment. The atmosphere is awesome and not overly crowded at all. Our drinks were never empty. The waiter was aware and eager to please with any request we had. The food. The food! Oh wow! It was so amazing. We had the best lamb shank ever. The variety of olives and spreads, CHEESES (there's an actual cheese room full of cheese and homemade breads!), pastas, desserts, the list goes on and on. We indulged in pure bliss. It is perfect for couples, friends and even large groups of people. My husband and I paid $330 (with all the taxes). Even though it is a bit pricey, we drank enough to equal out! I highly recommend Basilico for brunch
4
Great Starter selection a FB dessert as well, buffet is great value also and you can manage without a main course as so much choice, all very well cooked and presented. Waiting staff were great too and very attentive early on. Great decor but expensive drinks of course. Would go again,v try kid friendly
5
If you are looking for a buffet spread that's brings your taste bubs to Italy, this is the place to indulge. Basilico has been around for years, but it's a great gem in the city for those looking away from the conventional international buffet spread. The fine restaurant serves up Italian fare, based on what the season has to offer. Spread will spoil you thoroughly: seafood, selection of cheese, Italian dishes, drinks, etc.If you are choosy, this is pleasing
5
Excellent spread of Italian specialities, beautiful environment and service. Never failed me to date and we've been huge fans since discovering it almost 4 years ago
5
Great breakfast and we enjoyed a wonderful dinner at Basilico. The pasta was fresh and they served great wine by the glass.
5
Very good food. The dessert and cheese selections were very good. Didn't try many of the appetisers but will come back again to try. Ambience was nice also, but could be better.
4
Consistent high service level. Food quality was also good with wide variety of Italian specialities. The cheese room is always full of surprises.
4
There is a sumptous antipasti spread which will probably fill you up even before you start on your mains. Incredibly wide and fresh selection of meats, cheese, seafood and greens.By the time we started on the mains, we were a tad disappointed as it did not seem to catch up.Desserts are also free-flow.Not the cheapest of places, but quality comes at a price
4
We were looking for a family friendly Sunday brunch (lunch) spot in Singapore.Basilico didn't fail to please.Amazing spread of food. Well price drink and food package (especially compared to others) and a kids play room which is a bonus.Fois gras is a must here
3
Mushroom soup during lunch buffet was way too salty and tasted bad still despite giving feedback to the chef behind e counters. He just added hot water to adjust the saltiness. A small plastic sheet was being found in the small cup of tiramisu too. Will reconsider patronising this restaurant again.
5
We have been there 3 times for Sunday brunch and we love it.There are lots of good Italian food and everything is cooked perfectly. The atmosphere and service are very good. Ask for a table inside quieter room away from the main area if you prefer somewhere more cosy.It is a bit expensive as we are not drinking anymore and there is no discount for non-alcoholic brunch but still we think the quality of food still make it worth a trip. Highly recommended
4
This is excellent choice to try out Italian food. I've been here twice for dinner. It serves a semi-buffet which includes an antipasto spread, a main course selection as well as a dessert spread. You can choose just the anti-pasto or the whole semi-buffet. The anti-pasto will be enough to fill you up if you like bread, cold-cuts, salads and all. It's a large spread. There is even a wide selection of olive oil and cheeses to go with your food.We chose just the anti-pasto on our second visit after our first experience with the semi-buffet. It was the right choice. The selection of bread, tomatoes, burrata, marinated peppers, artichokes and all were just delicious. You wouldn't have room to try your Primo or Secondo.The waiters were all attentive and friendly. On our second visit, the waiter remembered us as we were assigned the same seats. A memorable and satisfying dining experience indeed
5
Was here last night to celebrate a friend's birthday. Requested for a quiet corner and was given a table at an area far away from the crowd. Waiters were attention. Selections were great. We were too full even without a main course. Thanks for the great experience!  
5
Spent another evening celebrating our wedding anniversary at Basilico. It was amazing and the food is wonderful. Service is superb as well. Will surely be going back.
5
Warm and cozy atmosphere. Friendly staffs. Food is very authentic and delicated. Definitely want to come back!
5
Nice food selections. Ambience was fun and not a typical boring Italian restaurant in a hotel. Value for money so a must visit if you are in Singapore
5
Enjoyed a pleasant Sunday brunch here this week. Impressed by the quality and diverse range of food on offer. Don't miss the cheese and bread room.
We had the champagne option. The table service was very good and unobtrusive.
5
We booked a buffet lunch for 1pm but could only reach at 1.30pm cos of the little one whom we had brought along.As the buffet ends at 2.30pm on Saturdays, we only had an hour to take the wide spread they always have. That also takes into account the feeding time for our little baby who was snugly fit into the baby chair. This was our third time there and Basilico has never failed to impress ever since we went there during our matrimonial stay when we held our wedding banquet at the Regent Hotel.Though the selection isn't as good as their dinner buffet, we still managed to get very good quality meats such as their beef, lamb, pork and salmon. We especially love the prosciutto ham with melon and gnocchi in truffle cream!Towards the end, even after 2.30pm, the chefs topped up the dessert after I mentioned that there wasn't enough.We were also served a slice of cake with a lit candle for the anniversary celebration!We were seated in an inner room with another large family with a baby and a rowdy group of Americans who were laughing really loudly. Other than that, the experience was great! The service staff, Claudine and Edward were friendly and prompt.We would definitely be going back for more! Kudos to the team at Basilico!
5
Been here a few times over the years and always had a good experience. The antipasti & dessert buffet never disappoints. There are the staples but the cheeses and cold cuts vary which makes it interesting as I like trying new cheeses etc but prefer not to eat a whole plate of one thing! The level of service is also good. It's obvious that they bother to train the staff
4
After 7 years in Singapore, I have been dining at Basilico multiple times per year for the past 5 years. The food: taste, quality & variety is above average for "western" fare in Singapore. While I used to rate the value of Basilio as excellent for the market, they have steadily increased the price and the value for money has declined, thus making a date at the venue, more-so for special occasions, then a monthly affair as it used to be. Service is great as the chefs and servers are very good. The cheese room is a delight and I highly recommend you give overall menu a taste.
1
Didn't make a reservation for lunch, so we were relegated to the outdoor seating. To my horror, the all the outdoor seats had noticeable bird faeces everywhere, and there was not a single seat without any nasty white smears. I couldn't even rest my arms on the arm rests of the chair, that was how dirty everything was. We eventually left to go to another restaurant, as this terrible level of hygiene is simply not acceptable for any food establishment, let alone for a five star hotel. I've been to cleaner hawker centres than this. dirty everything was
4
Basilico have surely a extremely nice location. We went for lunch buffet, the selection was good but I was expecting a bit more from the carving station, don't get me wrong the lamb leg, the beef tenderloin and the roasted chicken were perfectly done, let's say that wow factor was missing . Starter selection nice and fresh. Pizza was really really chewy for me. Desserts: gelatine in the tiramisÃ¹ made me a bit sad, but all the other desserts were nice. Icecream good but not exceptional.Staff in kitchen and service side where both extremely nice and professional, just receiving personel were missing on our arrival, we take ten minutes to find the host around the dining area.Price a bit high but still reasonable, don't forget is a 5 star hotel restauran
5
Wide selection of salad, cheese and desserts. The grilled beef is excellent. The variety of sorbets offered is also very different from the ice cream selections in other buffets. Everything is so tasty and wonderfully prepared. Good service and ambience. Great place for family or friends gathering as well as business
5
well decorated and all appetizers are delicious. Friendly staff and superb service also value add to this restaurant.
5
Great selection. Great service and a great wine selection. Thoroughly enjoyed the experience.
Nip to the bar across on the same level before the meal for a few starters.😉
5
The food is located within the Regent Hotel. It is a very classy environment with excellent staff service with a high quality of foods available for lunch and dinner. It has a particularly good range of Italian foods.
5
I've heard about basilico several times already before finally eating here, and it was.. fine. not the best one though for this kind of price. but the service was excellent, also there are plenty of choices for the dishes.

I was invited for dinner at this restaurant and we all agreed to have the buffet (Cold buffet) and what a pleasure it was. Loads of lovely italian salami's, cold cuts, salad, great bread, chesse and crackers and much more. Aside from this their dessert buffet was way too good for my belt as it must have shrunk during dinner - there were simply so many lovely things to try.Will definitely be going bac
5
We visited this place with two couples. I must say we had very high expectations, but none of us was disappointed.We choose the Prosecco and Wine option. All 4 different Wines were great.We all loved the cheese room and the all the fresh seafood. Great place to treat yourself
5
love the pasta and love the buffet spread.the chef also recommended the saffron and cherry sorbet (with some cherry sauce to be added) and it was really unique and tasty.However, keep the food options to pasta, as I believe it is this restaurant's forte. The salmon that I had had nothing to be raved about
3
I had high expectations for this place after seeing all the reviews, but after a weekend brunch and a-la carte dinner, I wasn't impressed at all. The only positives are the freshness of the cheese and salad bar, and the dessert selection. Not good value in my opinion
4
We had Sunday brunch here last week and it was exceptionally good.There is a wide choice of hot and cold dishes.The selection of cheeses is very good.The display of the dishes is super and looks very inviting.I was disappointed that our drinks package didn't include cocktails, just wine and beer

Our family had the buffet lunch on a Saturday afternoon. The restaurant was full but service was still efficient. We were asked our preference for fizzy or still bottled water when we indicated to the waiter our order for buffet lunch. We wrongly assumed bottled water was included in the buffet and we were charged S$12 per bottle of water on top of what we paid for the buffet. My friend later told me fruit juices were included in the buffet. We don't know if this is indeed the case as there was nothing on the hotel website or at the restaurant which explains what's included in the buffet. The waiter and waitresses who served us did not mention anything too.Overall, the buffet food quality and variety were good. We felt the desserts were excellent, so were the appetisers. The pizzas and pasta were average which was disappointing for a reputable Italian restaurant.It is unlikely we will go back again
4
Very good selection of salads, cheese, pizzas etc. Food is of good quality. service is fantastic. We had table facing the swimming pool.
5
This was 3rd time to enjoy dining over there with my wife. Excellent foods with excellent staffs. I must come back again.
5
The service and food was excellent. I had an enjoyable dinner experience with my girlfriend. The staff were extremely attentive to our needs.
3
Very good ambience, staff, starters n desert. But the mains were horrible vit the pasta not fully baked
5
Nice ambience, good varieties of buffet. Good services. Nice steak & pasta. Will definitely come back again.
4
Appetizer / dessert bar were amazing. Service was a bit off so that led to some disappointment in our mains. Nothing to write home about.
5
This is my 3rd time there but the first just having the antipasti and dessert buffet. As usual, child cuts, cheeses and tomatoes were excellent and this way they can truly be enjoyed.
4
Basilico has always been a firm favourite for all 4 of us. Especially when you have young adults with different eating preferences. The pizzas, pastas, cold cuts and cheeses are always a welcome sight for us. The restaurant staff have always been warm and friendly and this makes a great difference in having your family meals here.
4
My Husband picked this place to get our fill of all things Italian. At first the ambience and the courteous staff are sure to please you. The spread is of course lavish- but I personally felt the appetisers and desserts were the best. The charcuterie, cheese, breads are great and may not leave you very hungry for the mains. I felt the mains were pretty average (fyi they also serve some local curries for those not keen on Italian) - I would give their pastas and pizzas a pass- both were average when compared to the rest of the spread. At this point, the spread of desserts that are also very beautifully presented will win your heart. Finish with a truly Italian cappuccino. Go here for a business lunch or a romantic date or when you're craving some Italian!
5
This restaurant is inside the regent hotel and although not cheap by Sydney standards was excellent quality and variety. A lovely quiet place with attentive but not pushy waiters, to enjoy a romantic dinner, or a bite to eat at the end of an exhausting day
4
Breakfast is the most important meal of the day and Basilico strives to reaffirm that. A huge spread beckons one and a super-helpful staff ensures your day starts off on the just the right notes.
4
Great place for family but yet with an adult vibe. Service was discrete but yet attentive. Good that they never put up a fuss around kids.
5
I took my friend here to celebrate her birthday and was quite pleased with the wide spread of food, as well as quality service. The waitress who waited on our table cleared our plates and changed our utensils as soon as we are finished with the first round (you know how it is that sometimes when you are done with the buffet and no one clears your plate and it just clutter your table? Well not Basilico!) Absolutely love this place and will come back for more <3
5
The standards of the Italian buffet is high. Good spread of cheese especially. I also enjoyed their dessert section. Service and ambience notably good
5
The buffet had a very good spread of Italian food to choose from. I was surprised by the selection of cheese and sauces available that you can put with every dish there. The dessert is very good as well! But make sure you leave some space for it
5
The Basilico is in the Four Seasons Regent and has superb service and excellent buffet selections of Italian assaggi such as prosecute, various mozzarella di buffalo, marinated fish and many cheeses. The entrees are well prepared (halibut, cod, beef and lamb) and the deserts are excellent and widely diversified
5
I had the wagyu beef Bolognese tagliatelle .. It was excellent !!! The group of us was also treated to delicious freshly baked herbed tomato buns by the manager. Service was impeccable ! Would definitely go back there again.
5
delicious fres italian food. the salads are fresh and the amount of choice in both cheeses and desserts is staggering. love the food. the burratta and cold cuts are very nice. desserts are yummy including dessert. the spicy choclate biscuit with nuts and alcohol is a must hav
5
My visit last night to the restaurant exceeded any experiences I had at other hotel buffets (& I'm talking about greenhouse @ ritz Carlton, melt @ mandarin oriental & the line @ shangri-la) You may even argue that they have set themselves in an entirely different league. Every single detail was meticulously planned, from stepping into the restaurant to the hostess leading to you table, every ingredient you place in your mouth is the freshest and most authentic flavor you'll taste)- even the cherry tomato I had in my pasta was ridiculously sweet, the grapes laid out w the cheese was bursting with juices... If you are thinking of a perfect night out for celebration & food experience, this is it.
3
The title more or less summarises our experience. We were a group of 18 and we were given a quiet corner of the restaurant to ourselves, which was great. The wine list was comprehensive, and the cab sauv we chose (we plonked for the cheapest on the list) was already fantastic. The dinner buffet held an amazing spread. The jamon and iberico ham selection was fantastic, and so was the other cold cuts and olive spreads. You could order an a la carte main if you wanted to. Most of us did. It wasn't fantastic. I had the sirloin steak medium rare. It came out closer to well done. And it wasn't particularly flavourful. The dessert buffet atoned for the less than average main course.I would go back for the buffet, but not the a la carte
4
Staff are lovely, prompt service, good food.
Loved the fresh fruit at the breakfast buffet. Plenty of choice of different types of food. The bakery items were also delicious and too tempting.
5
A fantastic restaurant having a great breakfast spread. Only wish it had more Indian dishes but the Goan Fish Curry is a culinary greatness considering they do not have an Indian Chef.
5
Haven't been to Basilico in a while. Quality of food is as good as ever, service is great too. My favourite is their antipasti spread.
4
Food was fresh and of high quality. More fusion type as well. Didn't like that drinks were not part of the buffet. Service is very good as well.
5
There are hundreds of buffet restaurants of high quality in Singapore, but we think this is the Best by far and have visited often. The ingredients are very high quality, authentic Italian, and so much of it too. It is necessary to 'pace yourself'. I have often so enjoyed the salads, olives, meats, cheeses and anti-pasta, I have no room for the succulent lamb, beef, crusted salmon, lasagne, pastas etc. and you have to leave room for the tiramisu, pear tarts, mouth-watering gelatos and fruits. Oh, I wish I was there now.....
4
Was here for a business buffet lunch with my department and the CEO. Excellent wines, prompt service, good food! The only thing to improve on would be the Asian corner. It is not really what they are known for and also not what people go to Basilico for. But i totally understand the need for it. Nonetheless, it is a highly recommended restaurant for any occasion
2
Our family of three visited Basilico in mid-July. We heard positive comments about the establishment but it turned out to be a disappointing experience. First, the restaurant was big, but the space separating the several buffet counters was narrow, inhibiting the smooth flow of human traffic. With a full-house on that day, the overcrowded situation provoked some patrons to treat each others in a discourteous manner, hence resulting in a rather unpleasant dining experience. Second, as for the food, there is nothing specially Italian about it. On the main-course counter, there were a few lukewarm pizzas and pastas, and some over-cooked clams and mussels. Other offers are run-of-the-mill roasted beef, grilled fish fillets, pork chops, etc. To my amazement, there was also a counter that offered a mixture of local Singaporean and Southeast Asian hawker fare, which looked rather ridiculous! In short, very ordinary and not-very-Italian food at inflated price. Because of its uncivilized crowd and very average food, I will not recommend Basilico to anyone. For a more Italian dining experience, I will head for La Forketta just one block away from Basilico
5
Held our post wedding prosecco and wine brunch here for all the overseas visitors with toddlers. Had private table outside by the pool, with attentive waiter. Was recommended to us as a kid friendly venue with great food. Casual atmosphere without compromising on quality of food and wine
4
Interesting Italian restaurant where a fixed-price option is to have the antipasti and dessert buffet while ordering a main course. The appetizer selection is very high protein with lots of sausage, sliced meats, prosciutti, cured tuna, salmon and other fish, although somewhat salty. The smoked duck was good. Limited salad green selection- I thought the arugula was quite good. I had the misto fritti because they were serving soft shelled crab as my main course. There is a good selection of pastas, fish and meat options. Creme brule, tiramisu, and interesting selection of ice creams, I would recommend the pistachio where the nuts are candied and toasted as especially noteworthy. Service is very pleasant . The wait staff are attentive without being too intrusive
5
I have heard lots of good things before coming to this place. And it lives up to its good reputation. The service was impeccable and excellent. We were impressed by the attentiveness of the staff. The quality of food is great and authentic-- the antipasti spread is really impressive (they were really generous with the cheese), the mains were good and the desserts were very awesome (especially the blueberry yogurt icecream which was really yummy!). It is truly one of the best Italian restaurants in Singapore in the buffet setting
5
Amazing food, impeccable service. I've been here numerous times and both never fail to impress! Very, very good.
5
I had the most pleasant lunch for a family reunion. Two of my guests were vegetarian and the staff had went to lengths to ensure that there are ample suitable food for them. Thank you!!
5
My favorite restaurant in Singapore. Food is great and staff is very helpful and friendly. It is a bit pricey but worth every penny.
5
I love their menu - buffet of antipasto and dessert, and choice of main course. The choice of authentic Italian tomatoes, cheeses and cold cuts was the best I have seen. For the main course, the pork belly was outstanding! Ambience excellent too.
4
Excellent service, nice ambience and great antipasto buffet. While the dessert buffet spread looked very enticing, the sweet items didn't deliver on taste. This is a good restaurant for families, friends and couples.
4
Hands down best combo of great and authentic Italian food (in a buffet setting) and good service - excellent French manager and some terrific options for all the family.A few less attractive aspects - very poorly designed underground car park with no direct access so impossible to use with push-chairs and prams. Fairly pedestrian surroundings
4
Basilico never fails to impress. In my opinion it's among the top 5 Italian restaurant in Singapore. I am still reminiscing about the seafood risotto I had - Intense and complex flavour danced in my mouth spoon after spoon. The squid ink pizza is another star - the perfect balance between a thin crisp base and a softer seafood garnish
5
Had the 3 course semi buffet dinner with wide choice of anti pasti and dessert buffet. Food is typical Italian and is of good quality. You can be full just on anti pasti alone . Very nice and classy ambience. We sat at the area with a view of the pool. Service is great , esp the manager who came by our table to ask about the food and taking initiative to pass the dessert plates to us when we were going to the dessert station. We had a great dining experience here .
4
Generally good value and selection of Italian food. Service from reservations to dining was amazing. Improvements needed for desert selections , quality and presentation to match the hot counter/ cold cut counter.Soup was not even warm, but changed almost immediately when mention to service staff. Manager ensured fresh bowl was served when the renewed pot arrived.Hopefully next visit in coming August don't disappoint and hope to see improvement
4
I was staying at the hotel so had my breakfasts there and one night had dinner there. The food was great, very fresh and well worth the price, the service was pretty good as well. One of the best italian places that i have been to.
5
Make sure you go hungry when you get to Basillico! Their semi buffet menu is quite extensive and will make you feel very full. Overall good experience and worth the money!
4
nice ambience, good food, very nice italian ingredients.
service is very attentive
amazing cheeses, tiramisu was the best on the dessert counter
5
It was a challenge for us to visit this restaurant as we have small kids and we were not sure if we were allowed to go. Yey, it was no problem. I saw some family also had small children or even baby. Staff was very friendly and welcomed us very well. Choice of food was great. Different type of pasta, meats, seafood etc. I enjoyed cheese and cold meat selection too. We ate so much, but of course, we needed to have some dessert too. Great to go as a family, but next time, we would like to go there as a couple! Great setting, sophisticated atmosphere, yet, staff's service is very friendly and we felt happy being there entire time. We would love to go back there again
5
My wife and I, plus four friends, enjoyed the Basilico Saturday buffet once again. Our last visit was on 25th May 2013. It was just as good (I think) as before, with excellent food and service. I love the wine pours – not just bubbly – but excellent whites and reds from Italy. The main courses were a little disappointing – rather tough lamb and not very hot. However, the freshly shaved prosciutto makes up for any shortcomings in other departments! We are not seafood lovers but it would be very nice to have a few small prawns, poached salmon and the like. Overall, full marks once again
5
We visited Basilico in Dec 2014 for Sunday Brunch and did so again on 28 June 2015 to celebrate my husband's birthday. We were pleasantly surprised that their cheese room selections have changed and this time, it included blue cheese and soft cheese(many were made from sheep's milk) selections. A special mention for one of the chefs manning center counter (sorry I didn't get your name), he introduced the selection of balsamic vinegar and extra virgin olive oil they had on display, that was really useful cos I couldn't read the italian labels. Of which, there was a bottle of 25 year old balsamic vinegar, great with hard cheese and strawberry/vanilla ice cream. There was no vin santo gelato this time round, but strawberry, lemon & basil sorbet were really good for ending the meal. Lastly, thank you Basilico for the Birthday cake. The pralet was really tasty, you should consider having this on the buffet dessert selection
5
The dinner buffet selection may not be as broad as the typical multi-food station smorgasbord found all over Singapore, but Basilico spends far more effort on preparing a truly exquisite and focused selection of antipasti dishes, cured meats, cheeses and breads that stands out as one of the best foodie experiences in town. Chef Angelo and manager Vincent Fredon maintain some of the highest standards in food quality and SERVICE
5
Brought my partner there for her Birthday Celebration.She thoroughly enjoyed her experience there and so did I.We both had the semi buffet that consists of the Antipasti and dessert.The Antipasti Buffet had a wide spread of Cheese, Bread, Seared Tuna, salmon ect ectMy Partner ordered the Lamb and I got the Angus Beef for our Main courses.Both are amazing.We really enjoyed our time there and the service stuff, especially their floor manger were really warm and friendly
5
Came here with family and friends.It's pricey, but the experience here stuck with me for a while. The whole restaurant ambiance, food and setup was so amazing. The variety was excellent. They offered such a wide range of food at the buffet table and I tried stuff that I never tried before and loved it!Definitely will be back during special occasions
4
Celebrated our 7th wedding anniversary here and it's pretty posh. From the grand entrance to the impeccable service made our dinner a enjoyable one.We had the half buffet with free flow of entree and desserts. Wife ordered the tenderloin and I ordered the crispy pork belly. The skin of the pork belly was awesome, very crispy. The pork belly was placed on a stack do sour vegetables which complemented the fatty pork. The tenderloin was cooked to perfection.The entree dishes at the buffet were fantastic especially the different type of hams on offered. Many different brand and taste of balsamic and olive oil for you to go with the wide variety of bread. I love the cakes and gelato on the buffet spread as well.Service wise, exceptional! From the entrance and throughout the meal, the wait staff ensured that we are well taken care of. We were even given a cake for our wedding celebration which we appreciate the gesture.All in all, a great and nice Romantic dinner experience. One draw back was the fact that the tables could be located further apart from each other.The meals come up to be around $200 plus a bit

Tried Basilico for dinner. Sited in the Regent Hotel, the centrepiece is a circular tablesetting with the antipasti displayed prominently, and desserts to one side. The initial downside to Basilico is the website - it doesn't really give very good information on the options available, for casual browsers. Basically, for dinner, you have a choice of taking only the antipasti buffet, or the combination of antipasti buffet and one mains from the menu choice and the dessert buffet. There are several variations on prices that include alcohol - prosecco, and processo and one glass of wine - to go with your meal.The range of antipasti was extravagant - cured meats, cheeses, salads, marinated fruits, nuts, and seafood. Mostly cold, though, so you have to enjoy antipasti. The mains were ordered from the menu - very generous portions, and of a really high standard. We enjoyed the lamb rack and braised pork belly. Desserts were of a reasonably high quality - I notice most hotel buffets struggle with desserts. The tiramisu was sadly lacking in liquor, but the rest were pretty good - and the sorbets and gelato were always welcome. Service was exceptional for a buffet - I can't emphasize how well the staff coped, from explaining the dinner options, to keeping an eye out for when the main meals should be served, bringing the wine options as the mains were served - all small points that one takes for granted, but is not easy to execute in a busy buffet setting.Prices are a little bit on the high side (for hotel buffet), and you rarely get credit card offers at the Basilico, but I guess it depends what your priorities are.In summary - well worth a visit if you do like Italian cuisine well -executed, and you *must* like antipasti as the Basilico doesn't really offer alternative options for those who aren't so keen. This isn't like your typical pile-em-high, offer-them-everything sort of place. Main courses are generously sized, and, sit back and enjoy the service
4
Nice quite atmosphere. Good service. Chef, truly Italian cuisine.
Also nice breakfast if you stay in the restaurant. Weekends also they have an interesting brunch. I would only advice it if you are interested in a heavy lunch.
4
It was a bit expensive but worth for money. Variety of cheese and the meat was nice.
Need more meat variety, only Pork was there.
4
An excellent spread of cheeses and cold cuts. service was excellent and staff very attentive to your needs. Will definitely recommend this for a special occasion or get together with good friends over a superb Italian spread.
4
Very friendly staff. I was able to obtain a customized meal to suit my dietary requirements. Heavy on the pocket, best visited on business trips!
4
Basilico offers many dining options which is very flexible and with nice ambience. We enjoyed the antipasti buffet. It has wide varieties such as different kinds of cheese, cold cuts, wild rockets, Sicilian tomatoes which is very sweet and crunchy, marinated seafood, lots of salads, pizzas, etc. The desserts are not too bad, but a bit sweet for us.The staff is very attentive & helpful, came by frequently to check how's the food and is everything ok. They even go the extra mile to bring a nice cake & sang a birthday song for my wife, full of initiative.Thank you for making our evening dinner memorable.

Part of the Regent Hotel's selection of restaurants, the Basilico serves up Singapore's only Italian-themed Sunday Champagne brunch. The restaurant is spacious, nicely appointed with comfortable seating and a lovely arrangement of buffet counters that nicely segregates the various edible attractions on offer.Highlights are the pan-seared foie gras station, that serves up lovely morsels of liver to order, with a drizzle of balsamic reduction. The roast meats are also excellent, with a roast pork belly that was deliciously moist with a super-crisp crackling. But the highlight of Basilico's brunch experience has to be its cheese room, with no less than 22 different types on offer the day we dined here. Every dish we tried was delicious, service was efficient and the waiters had a fine attention to detail, filling our flutes without us having to ask, clearing our plates promptly the moment we left our table to get more food and always topping up our water glasses without prompting.All in all, a very good place for a lazy, boozy Sunday brunch. Would definitely go back
2
This is my 4th times visiting but can't help getting the feel that the standard in food, service, everything is degrading. The choice of the buffet, especially the appetizer, was pathetic and uninteresting. The quality, choice, layout, was way below a fine dining standard to the point it was embarrassing for me, that my guest and I have to walk round the buffet spread struggling to fill up our plate. This is despite the price seems to go up in every time of my visit. The main reason I went was my guest likes the lamb chop but even then I don't see the excitement anymore in this visit. For the same price I would visit some of the higher end buffet like The Line at Shangri-La anytime(that I just happened to visit the weekend before)... the choice of food is incomparable(obviously), far better quality even it fully pledge buffet, and service was better as the server to guest ratio is much better. While the servers at Bascillico were very professional and polite, there was an obvious shortage of people; I have to walk to the counter to ask for my bill. Sorry pal, this would be my last visit to the restaurant,
5
Basilico offers a nice setting and several dining options. We decided to go for the antipasti buffet.Food is genuine and very good quality, from time to time they chance a few items. I would say that at least 80 percent of the options are top class which is very good for a buffet.In the end, after enjoying the appetizers we were so sull that we declined to go for the desserts. Next time..
5
Basilico is the real authentic Italian dining experience, Specializing in fresh seasonal ingredients brought together to create hearty regional fare. The interior is stunning with bright marble floors, gorgeous buffet counters; and the central area with three open kitchens for antipasto, hot foods, and dessert makes quite an impression the moment we step into the restaurant. The highlight was the buffet with its divine selection of cold cuts, cheeses, and other classic antipasti selections, the a la carte items are where the creative minds of the chefs really shine. Our choices of the Linguine Vongole and Wagyu sirloin both demonstrated the passionate verve with which pastas and meats were handled .The way in which the restaurant’s sections are designed means that whether it’s full or empty, the restaurant never feels overly crowded or uncomfortably quiet. Each area feels both self-contained, and yet still part of the entire restaurant. The service we had was simply superb, Attentive but not invasive, giving advice and guidance on the menu and their recommendations were spot on, management and staff is a delight, and well organized. Regardless of why and when you go though, we've found that Basilico is ever-popular and often crowded. So plan ahead and i guarantee that you won't regret it. Thanks for a great meal we shall return
5
For an italian restaurant famous for its buffet spread, I wasn't expecting too much in terms of service. Buffet and attentive service? Doesn't seem to go together. But boy was I surprised! We were welcomed at the door by the manager and hostess and then led to our private dining room (it was a dinner for 8). We then had a dedicated server for our room, who kept refilling our glasses, clearing our plates, folding our napkins etc. I really couldn't ask for more. We had the option of either having only the appetizer buffet, the appetizer and dessert buffet or the appetizer and dessert buffet with a main. We opted for the appetizer and dessert buffet. The appetizer buffet selection was quite extensive, with a lot of quality ingredients and cheeses. To me, the mozarella alone was probably worth half the price of the meal. But don't just stop there, there are some excellent italian hams, salads and cheeses. After appetizers, we moved on to dessert. I wasn't blown away by the dessert selection. There were a lot of mousse cakes, which I am not a fan of. They all tasted good, but also generic. And really, for dessert, I think all I need is one good one (not too heavy) and I'd be happy. Too big a spread and I feel a little sick with all the sugar. All in all, not a cheap meal but very good value. I'll probably be back, but next time, I think I will just have the appetizer only buffet and skip the main and desserts
5
Overall the experience was awesome. Good spread of cheese, seafood, ham, poultry, pizza, pasta and dessert. Very nice and cozy setting, definitely worth the price and my gf and I really enjoyed it!
4
Their dinner and brunch buffets are good quality and good value for money. If you are there for dinner, you can hop over to Manhattan (across) afterwards for drinks.
5
The buffet includes complete antipasta, salads, and various main dishes such as meat, seafood and pasta, as well as a range of coffee and tea.
5
I thoroughly enjoyed every thing. The food was to die for as was the mumm champagne. Will be back, well worth the money.
5
Italian food done to absolute perfection, delivered in hearty and generous portions. Stellar desserts, and for lunch, they even have a small but simply delicious selection of local dishes. Could you ask for more? The long and short of it is, NO. You simply cannot.
5
The food at the buffet fantastic with good combinations of seafood, fresh cakes, healthy salads. One of the I have experienced. Also the staff were very friendly, in fact manager came & shook my hand & asked me how my day was - very impressive & certainly not aloof like other hotels. Thanks for a great meal
5
Basilico provides a large variety of high quality Italian and Mediterranean treats. I personally loved the mozzarella buffet with at least 7 different Mozzarella, the risotto and the panned foie gras. The restaurant itself is a little bit too dark for me, I recommend to take one of the table outside
5
Can you find an al dente pasta in Asia where they always overcook the pasta as they imagine it to be noodle with reason? No. Here you have chefs that are educated in Europe. The lobster pasta was a delight, honestly, I had one in Hong Kong few days ago but this one was incredible. The service was superb, the Filipino guy went out of his way to please. Man, Filipinos are the greatest in hospitality. They are gentle and sweet and the girls speak perfect English. We need to help that country more. They are the best
5
Inside the Regent Hotel, was the Basilico restaurant. The hotel is amazing, very luxurious, is very close to one of the main avenues of Singapore (Orchand Road), where there are plenty of malls and shopping. The Italian and Mediterranean food restaurant is great, the food is delicious and there are many options.
4
Have not had the buffet for a couple of years now and just last Sunday hosted a family lunch there. Not only was the food selection extensive they were of good quality across the board which is a bit of a rarity. You know how buffets impress you with their spread and colour until you taste it? The pricing was fair for the deal you get - attentive service and good food in a comfortable setting - can't ask for more.But yes, there is just one thing I would like to ask for. To better manage how they show diners into the restaurant. There is always a crowd of diners at the entrance at buffet start time and everyone of us have a reservation. If only the management would solve this, then this place would be perfect.I was really impressed that the restaurant did not chase us out once the buffet closed and the staff started setting the tables for dinner service. We finally left around 4pm and there were still diners lingering behind to chat. Now, this is truly good hospitality cos we don't dine out just to fill our stomachs but in such a nice space, we meet friends and family to catch up. And know what? The service staff was still topping up our water glass until the time we left. Well done
5
Thank You Again Chefs at Basilico - We love the fresh Italian ingredients, from the variety of tomatoes (yay they taste like tomatoes) to the wide choice of cheeses complimented by various honeys. The salads and cold cuts are amazing too! Desserts are consistently good. We were so full on the buffet - we barely had room to consume our Mains. The wine list is quite good too. We've combed the web for a dining option for our anniversary dinner...we keep coming back to Basilico - we will be there early May! Thanks
4
Bkd a table to celebrate hubby's bd. Was very impressed with the spread of the appetisers. Good spread of sashimi and cheese. Tuna and beef was our favourite. Honestly, we got carried away with the starter buffet spread and almost forgotten about our main course. For the main course, the rack of lamb is the best. Tender and moist. The sea bass was very good. Angus beef was a little overdone and the accompanying pasta is not what I am used to. Then came the dessert buffet spread. We had to be very careful by then because the tummy is already to the max. The apple crumble and bread pudding are my favourite. Overall everyone had a good n very satisfying meal.
4
Yes! you've nailed it. If you are sucker for wonderful service experience. I think Basilico live to it's name. However, make your special request or reservation in advance. I did mine and it all turn out well. They even give us a seat facing the swimming pool. It was necessary as we were feeling intimated when we walk into the restaurant. The pool view has helped us feel relaxed and we move on to stuff these yummy food to our starving stomach. The food were not bad. More to the salty side. The vanilla gelato taste great too. Was expecting for more choice like pistacho or peppermint. Smoked turkey, salmon and ham are delightful. Choice of good flavour of cheese and fresh bread are also avaliable. I will say the variety for the buffet spread are justifiable to the cost of the buffet
4
The food is delicious, very tasty and various. We can find all of the best Italian options (fresh mozzarella, pizzas, risotto, lasagna...etc.)It is a buffet so you can help yourself as much as you want.Good to have a table next to the pool for the lunch.We went there for a bachelorette party and went for the option with unlimited prosecco
4
My visit to basilico was nothing short of amazing... The service and buffer spread was superb. However my only fault with the dinner service was that the mains served were overly seasoned and cooked. My partner and I asked for the lamb and the beef respectively... My beef was alright, but too well done for my liking ( i told the server i had wanted it medium rare), similarly my partner's lamb dish was also overcooked. The sides for the beef were mediocre with the watercress/spinach (cant rmb) doused in what seemed like heaps of salt. I wasnt exactly pleased with the quality of the mains but the appetizer and the dessert buffet did make up for the disappointing mains. My bill totaled to about 235 for 2 people, i dont think i will come back for a second visit

I had the pleasure to have a dinner in Basilico last week, after reading all the positive reviews and I have to say it's exactly as good as everybody is saying. The quality of the ingredients at the appetizer buffet is incredible, you'll find regional Italian products very hard to find here in Asia, like mozzarella burrata, smoked mozzarella and other lovely treats that Italian guests and non will go crazy for.The dinner costs almost twice as much the price of lunch, so if you search for convenience i recommend to chose lunch buffet and make a reservation to make sure to have a table, as the seating capacity of the restaurant isn't that bi

I've had one of the most memorable and pleasant experience the one time we dined in at Basilico in Regent.The staff was friendly, and of course, that genuine Italian dishes to be had on buffet.I especially like their lasagna. It tasted exquisite. And the sausages, the desserts, ahhh mouth-watering
5
I do not normally sing the praises of any restaurant. Being Italian, grown up in Italy eating the best and most genuine food one can imagine, I am not easily seduced by fancy restaurants serving food in 'towers' or by those serving chemical experiment as opposed to real food.Basilico was a revelation. Even before finding out the head chef is Italian (from the Puglia region) I could tell there was someone behind this restaurant who knew what they were doing and who knew how to source good, delicious ingriedients. The meal starts with a buffet starter which includes salads, amazing breads (including truffle bread), cured meats (the salami is exceptional), cheeses (to die for), lots of sea food salads, earhy salads, olives, etc, etc.Diners then can select a main course each: this sets the restaurant aparts from the others as the choice, quality and presentations of mains is 'fine dining' quality and would not be normally associate with a set price meal. My main of roast suckling pig with wine infused apples was exceptional.Meal ends with the dessert buffet where everything, including the delicious ice cream is made by the chefs on site.The staff, especially Davide are attentive, but not intrusive and the ambience is lovely.Do yourself a favour and eat there as soon as possible or you will regret it

I booked a dinner reservation a week ago for my wife's birthday treat and Basilico as usual, does not fall short of its own expectations beginning right from the doorstep when we were hosted and brought to a quiet corner as requested in my reservation.It was quality food as always at the buffet spread with the various cheese and bites available. Prosecco was as good as recommended.The only major disappointment or turn-off if i may, was that there were actually hair found in the mains (Braised pork belly) that i ordered. We were suspicious initially and even tried to reason it could just be burnt strips.Called our server over and she instantly acknowledged that it was hair indeed. SOP for her was to offer a new plate but no point in doing so since we were almost full. It'll be simply a waste of food. I decided to take pictorial evidence as well before the plates were cleared.I was expecting the Restaurant Manager to come and perhaps apologise for such a big hoodoo but there was simply no one. Too busy or maybe not a big issue, huh?I'll look forward to their response if Basilico gives a bother about this. It'll be otherwise a great disservice to themselves considering the rave review and recognition they are accorded by appreciative diners.We certainly do not expect to pay a premium for dinner and expect to see hairs in our food
5
Family dinner with abundance of excellent alternatives for starters, very good main course and a dessert table with everything your hearth desires!A brilliant experience - this is for my 4th time there and I will come back.The service very good and good coffee delivered soon after ordering.
5
I went for restaurant week, so there was antipasti and dessert buffet with a main course.
Very worthwhile, food was delicious and well executed. Service was impeccable.
Enjoyed myself.
5
The dinner spread was fantastic. Enjoyed the cheese spread & the appetizer buffet. Wait staff was amazing especially Mr. Monte Carlo who made our experience memorable with his passion for his job & personalised service

Great semi-buffet Italian restaurant, most ingredients were sourced from Italy directly, love everything from there especially their homemade pasta!
4
Good variety thro out the week,...
you can njoy different cuisines...
dessert section is amazing too.
5
Food: 3 spreads: 1 main (add $20-ish); 1 appetiser buffet; 1 dessert buffet (the latter 2 add up to $60/pax). The appetiser buffet contains the following: tons of cheese, salmon, cod, seabass, tuna, angus beef, salads and dressings galore, all kinds of pork that we could not pronounce, mussel, fruits, bread, and tons of dips.The dessert buffet was to die for. Cake, ice cream, tiramisu, pancetta, creme brûlée, apple crumble, etc. Look out for the server because she will look out for you (I think all staff have been explicitly told to maintain eye contact, which is quite interesting for Singaporean staff). All in all, a great experience with a surprise b’day cake at the end! Oh and we were interviewed by waiters on the food at least 5 to 8 times (we lost count). So be prepared with your lavish praise
4
This is s good fine dining restaurant wherein our group had an appetizer/antipasti buffet consisting of cold cut meats, fresh salads, pasta and authentic Italian cheeses. Main course served was tenderloin inclusive of 1 glass of wine. The dessert consisting of fresh fruits , pastries and ice cream/gelato were also served buffet style. I liked my dining experience. Won't hesitate having my buffet fix at this place in the near future
4
Usual fancy restaurant in a Hotel setting atmosphere. Now, The food was amazing. I'm Italian and I loved it. Semi Buffet with choice of one main. The Semi buffet was VERY well equipped with all the food I would expect to have seen and more. Much needed. The desserts, were ok, nothing to write home about....The price is high and the wine is very expensive. I also noticed that the patron next to us had the same wine as us and his wine glass filled almost to the top of the glass and ours was barely at the mark, so not sure what that was about. Service was good and with a smile. The manager Vincent, although nice, seemed to be a bit of a helicopter with his waiters (who were awesome) so he needs to back off a bit. Would I go back soon?, probably not simply due to the cost. If you're looking for a pricey date night, this place is a contender
5
Basilico is the definitive Italian buffet in town - in fact it's a semi buffet in that your choice of the main course is prepared to order and served at your table.Well that is if you have space left after trying the sumptuous never ending spread of antipasti , salads and cheeses. A special mention must be made of the cheeses - as Basilico has perhaps the largest variety of authentic and sometimes rare Italian cheese on the buffet.The wine list is equally extensive with some reasonable options - they do have a few half bottles too which is a great thing if you are not drinking much. The pairings are OK and I felt the prosecco is best suited for lunch or brunch - they could have paired a nice white with the antipasti.The main course options are good although I wish there were a few more pasta options. The portion sizes are quite large and it's difficult to finish that after having stuffed yourself on antipasti and Salads and with desserts to go. I had the lamb-chops which were done exactly right although I found the plate a little messy with the pile of beans and spinach - could have been a little more elegant ! The dessert counter is extensive and everything is good - they have an I resetting choice of Italian sorbets and gelato also - I wish they always have pistachio gelato though as its so typically Italian !The service is great and the staff smiling and friendly ! Very good to see that !The hotel Regent itself and the restaurant are very nicely designed and put you in the right ambience to have a nice evening !The buffet is not cheap at 88++ ( 2 glass pairing 123 ++ and 3 glass pairing at 143 ++) but you get a great spread with excellent service in a beautiful restaurant. Worth it for me !Highly recommended if Italian food cravings hit you

Me and my husband had lunch buffet at 'Basilico' this valentines day. Read so many positive reviews about their buffet. And, here is my positive review for 'Basilico'.Quick reservation process. Friendly staff. Great buffet spread. Saturday Lunch serves up an extensive Antipasti spread of succulent seafood, Italian cold cuts and over 10 types of cheeses. The Rotisserie, Carving and Grill stations offer perfectly-cooked fish, poultry and meats, Pizzas, Pastas. Select from eight piping hot main dishes from the Buffet Table and more than 15 types of handmade cakes and sweet treats await at the Dessert and Italian Gelato counter. I am a foodie... So, i tried almost everything... :D Everything tastes real good and super high quality. Fresh seafood in antipasti. Must try white cream gnocchi, grilled salmon, seafood pasta. yumm!! sorbets especially, lemon basil sorbet. So fresh!! But, one of their pizza.. 'tomato and mushroom' was bit messy. I guess because, sauce they are using for pizza was bit too runny, making that thin crust mushy. Awesome Food, ambiance, perfect service makes 'Basilico buffet' a must do. Highly recommended

What a wonderful lunch buffet. The cheeses were mind blowing as there were so many.. I was very pleased.. and tried most of them. Found the addition of the Asian dishes a little odd and unnecessary. Only tried the wasabi prawns which were yum.The mains.. beef was a Lil dry but the rest... especially the chicken which I'm usually not a fan of was brilliant as it was so juicy.The lasagne and seafood linguine was superb Dessert wise.. I was quite stuffed but made room for the bite sized lemon tart.... oh.my.gawd. One of the best I've had. Brilliant.Will be back
4
Everything is fine except that you sometimes feels that they are understaffed but you know they are doing their best to make this a great dinner outing.
4
Good value for money, waiters are very polite, good service. Sommelier knows his job.
We would go back again.
4
Reasonable price for a good lunch buffet - high quality ingredients and a wide spread of breads and cheeses. Definitely a treat!
4
Finally, finally. I have found the BEST desserts in a hotel buffet. Previous experiences elsewhere had led me to disappointments because the savouries always shone more than the sweets. Over here, most if not all desserts had clearly lived up to our expectations, probably even beyond.The price of this brunch buffet might be steep but for the opulent spread of food and its quality, flawless service and ambience, it was a meal worth indulging and splurging on. Highly recommended especially if you love foie gras, seafood and cheeses.For full review and pictures, please check out my blog post:http://www.springtomorrow.com/2015/01/21/sunday-brunch-basilico-the-regent-singapore

Had a Saturday dinner buffet cost us $88++ ( with no wine) and $98++ ( with a glass of wine). Reservation made through Chope and it was so easy. Done in 5 minute with confirmation. The wine was so so only. Love their service. Very attentive and smiley, happy face all over. Choice of starter was way too many that one can never try all in one night. Think that is why the main dishes portion was small. Dessert was nice. Love the whole experience.
5
Let me start by stating, my wife and I are average people, our son lives in Singapore and we visit a few months from the U.S. each year. Now down to business, it is a great place to eat, probably one of the best we have been to in Singapore. I would suggest you go hungry and plan to stay long, that is the only way you can begin to get your monies worth. The food was great, sevice was wonderful, very clean and the setting is most impressive. Now for the down side, it isn't cheap. Your paying for all you are getting. It's not a place we would consider for regular visits but one for the special meal out. We would go back, HUNGRY
4
What a great night we had, firstly we didn't like the table assigned to us at the back of the restaurant but that was not a hassle they soon moved us to the perfect table near the pool. As we waited for the table we had a lovely chat with one of the friendly chef's who was setting up the delightful buffet.We choose a selection of buffet and additional items from the a la carte menu,all excellent!Service was fast and freindly.Would we return, yes at a blink of a eye lid
5
Once again a wonderful experience with fanstatic food and excellent service. It has became a must do thing for all our oversea friend visiting Singapore! It never disappoint any of our guests, we have some much praises for it. It is really a great place to entertain friend and enjoy delicious Italian food! Great job! 
5
Our family of 12 enjoyed yet another brilliant evening at Basilico. It was our 3rd consecutive Christmas eve family dinner there, and our 4th in 5 years.We had a marvelous time yet again - excellent food and impeccable service. Our special thanks to Gibson our waiter on that occasion, who did everything which should be done, and did it better! He even offered a (matching!) shawl to my 80-year old mother in anticipation of her comfort - the family was impressed. Thank you very much indeed for a truly splendid celebration; we will definitely be back
5
I had reserved 2 seats for dinner on 8th Jan as it was my girlfriend's birthday and also our 6th year together. I had reserved a Sfera from Dolcetta to be served to my girl since it was a special day.Few days prior to the actual day, the service staff called to confirm my reservation. On the day itself, we reached fairly early as our dinner is at 7pm. Asked if we could go in early and yes we could. Ambience was great.When ordering the main course, I ordered lamb chops and the waitress even recommended me the doneness. I requested for grounded pepper and they acceded.There was a candle when serving the Sfera and it kinda looked awesome.Had a great dinner, service was attentive and prompt. Will be back again and thanks to the stagf for making it a great experience
5
Wanted to have a nice lunch for new year, but it was far better than our expectations. Perfect service, awesome seafood, variety of cheese, and much more. Can just highly recommend this beautiful place
5
Really enjoyed the food can't wait to go back. My daughter dropped a plate and the staff still treated us well!
5
It's our first visit to Basilico Sunday Brunch. I was attracted by burrata and the cheese room idea. Overall review, the cold cuts selection were great. Cheese room selections were mainly hard cheese, would like to see more soft cheese varieties. And my favourite cheeses were burrata and smoky burrata at the main buffet area! Oh yes, the vin santo gelato was a rare find, remember to leave stomach for that.Certainly there is room for improvement..1. CoffeeRather poorly done by an automatic espresso machine. The coffee was burnt unfortunately. Would be good if Basilico is willing to invest in a Barista or a better coffee machine. We would also like to see them serve italian coffee beans.2. Crackers in the cheese room Jacobs crackers just didn't do the cheese justice, there was some weird taste from the shortening in the crackers. Table water or cheaper option, Meiji crackers would be much better.All in all, the vin santo gelato, burrata, cold cuts and varieties of cheese made me a happy customer
5
This place is the best in Singapore. The southern italian food is fresh, tasty and well presented. The Sunday buffet is excellent, especially the cheese room. Value is excellent for the food and drink that is provided. Service is excellent. The restaurant is well worth it and you will not be disappointe
5
Great food, attentive service. It was my first time here but will definitely return. Highly recommend this place if you like Italian foo
5
I'm normally skeptical about buffets as they tend to be crowded, over-filled with children screaming and all the 'good stuff' get consumed very quickly. However, Basilico was not at all like that. The selection of food was excellent, love the Italian theme. I hardly had to wait in line for anything, and of course, the free flow prosecco and wine was great. Our glasses were never empty! Love that it's not a huge place
5
Great restaurant, love the options of EntrÃ©e/Starter from Buffet then main can be ale carte then dessert back at buffet or you can just have buffet etc. Food terrific as was the service. My advise is to have a pre-dinner cocktail at the Manhattan Bar fabulou
4
We went for a birthday celebration brunch buffet. The price is really scary at first until I saw the spread of food and quality of service. We were spoilt! From the seafood, meats, ice cream, not one of it disappoints. The ambience is excellent. Things to note: Carpark is expensive at the hotel, remember to make reservation, everything is great, of course it comes at a price, it's not very affordable (at least for me) I will motivate myself to work hard so that I can come back here again often.
5
Beautiful pastries and cakes, with great coffee. The pastas and rolls were very nice. A nice quiet place to escape the busy surrounds of Singapore for a few minutes
5
It was a birthday celebration and what drew us there was the extensive brunch buffet and the foie gras. The restaurant did not disappoint. Loved the seafood section which was chockful of lobsters, crabs, prawns and scallops and my favourite was the divine fresh gnocci that was made on the spot. Even the hot foods section was very enticing, with the roast pork and roast beef beautifully done. In addition, the restaurant is top notch in terms of ambience and service. I will definitely be back
5
Italian restaurant, we did not take the buffet but had al a carte and the quality of the food is absolutely excellent. Highly recommended
5
The fishes (salmond) tastes as if they are just caught from the sea, the beef are delicious, while there are many choices of cheeses and fruits to choose. The staff are very helpful.
2
We arranged a birthday dinner at Basilico. We told the manager and three other servers that I had a severe dairy allergy, and they would alert the kitchen. My minestrone arrived with garlic bread. I asked if the bread had any dairy. I first was told 'no' and they would check. The server came back and said the bread had butter. My spaghetti with clams arrived. It was so salty and spicy I could only consume half of this dish. We then tried to order a pizza and were told the pizza oven no longer worked
5
We always enjoy our dinners at Basilico. It was perfect, as usual! The staff is always very froendly and food is great.     
4
When i did my reservation i did mention its was our wedding anniversary. It would be nice if the restaurant staff greet and wish us happy anniversary or give us a small complimentary dessert to make the occasion more special as its our 4th visit to Basilico.  
5
Great meal, great ambiance, great service!!! What else can I say! Our family of four had a great time there for their semi-buffet dinner. Two of us opted for wine to go with the buffet and both the white and red wine that the staff recommended were very good
4
Had the buffet lunch few days back and it was my 2nd visit for the year. Same buffet spread, same great quality and service provided by the staffs.There's a wide choices of cheese, pastas and it has also one of the most comprehensive spread of salad green.Make a bee line for the roast pork as early as possible - it's the local favourite
4
Loved the dining experience. Fabulous food and great service rendered by Davide and Gibson. Would recommend.
5
Lunch at Basilico truly hit the spot. We have been in Singapore three months and have missed eating foods we typically find in our own country. We enjoyed all of the options from salads and grilled vegetables, to meats and fishes, to the extensive assortment of cheeses, jams, and breads. The options were endless and the quality was superior. We look forward to our next visit!
5
Fantastic food, great service, excellent value and good ambience. Foie Gras and cheeses are the catch! pity no freshly shucked oysters but its not a deal-stopper, given the superb quality of the food selection. The Chope service is also great - almost guaranteed my reservation which needed a voice confirmation from the restaurant to seal the deal
4
If you want a really good Sunday brunch, this is a good option. Wine free flow and amazing buffet. Riavoli is a must taste.
5
This was my fifth time at Basilico and I will keep coming back because it never fails to impress! The service was impeccable, and the food superb, as always! Sunday brunch here is the best for special occasions!
4
I was at Basilico for lunch with a friend on a Saturday. We decided to have lunch there after hearing good reviews about the place and we both loved Italian food. The ambience is warm and cozy. A good place to meet up friends for nice long lunch and chit chat. The service staff are very friendly and attentive. We were seated in a nice corner.We tried almost every dish. The salads were fresh and there was a good selection of salads available. The cheese was heavenly. Basilico also has a good selection for cold cuts. I thoroughly enjoyed the parma ham and sweet melon. I had roast beef, roast chicken and roast lamb for main. The meat was fresh and cook to right standard. I had a second helping on the meats. However I do wish they had more selection on pasta section. Perhaps they can consider adding a cold pasta. I also wishes they can find a way to keep the soup warm as I like my soup warm. The desserts selection was very good. I normally limit myself on desserts but at Basilico I could not help but to go for almost every single dessert my stomach could handle. The buffet was one of the best I had for a long time. I will recommend it to my friends and go back again
5
Fantastic antipasti and dessert buffet with a la carte main course for dinner!  Sunday lunch buffet even better: focus on the burrata n crab!!!
5
I was at Basilico on Oct 11, 2014 for dinner with a friend.The ambience of the restaurant was welcoming and cozy. A bit too dark for me, though. The food was superb. I had the foie gras and caprese salad as starters. I was delighted at how good they were. The portions were generous. Great start. I had the lamb chops for the main and it was well done, indeed. Paired it with a Barolo 2009 which went very well together.Service was really attentive despite the fact that they were running pretty full. Very willing and able to recommend food and wines. Regularly checking on you. Loved getting real service, something that is increasingly difficult to find in Singapore.When heading to the Basilico, you get food for worship
5
Food were marvelous and let's not talk about the quality, is the best.The staff? There is really no words to describe how wonderful all the staff were! They are extremely helpful and great with the little one
4
The food and service was very good as always, the only bad thing that happened this time we visited Basilico was a bug at the appetizers table, i was shocked for this. 
5
It is a buffet that serves a-la-carte standard food. Food is fresh and quality is the top. I wish that they have a selection of soft cheese which I hope will be added to the buffet spread in the future. Lastly I like to see that this restaurant will continue to maintain their standard.
4
Loved the antipasti spread. I ordered the risotto with porcini and foie grais mousse, generous portion, intricate taste. The dessert buffet was ok, tiramisu was good but the sorbet was quite sweet. Service was good
5
Atmosphere was inviting. Attentive, discreet team of service staff who cleared our empty plates promptly & refilled the water regularly and is always around when you need them. Was slightly disappointed with the desserts section as the portions of the cakes & pastries were too big for buffet portions. The mains we ordered (2 pasta dishes) were well executed & nicely plated too. Felt it was worth the price we paid but probably only for special occasions.
5
The Restaurant Managers always gives us a superb wine recommendation. Good selection. We live the buffet..always superb quality and some really select fresh dishes. The cold cuts and got met tomatoes and specialist mozzarella are great.
5
i only had 10 minutes for breakfast due to in a rush for meeting. But it was very nice. I saw lots of food, though i only took some bacon and Miso Soup. Really want to go back
3
I had asked for a quiet table away from kitchen and cash register as we previously had a bad experience with this somewhere else.Unfortunately, we were then placed in what they had obviously cornered off as the kids section. Running and screaming kids everywhere which seriously spoiled the ambience. At times I could hardly hear what was said just opposite me. Also, some of us had chosen the champagne/wine option and had to ask a few times for a refill after our glasses had been empty quite a while.But food was very delicious
4
There will be something here to satisfy even the picky eaters, and it's a great place for celebrating family birthdays or for other large groups. Love the cheese station, and variety of Italian food available. Order the free flow prosecco
5
I have eaten here on numerous occasions over the last few years and it remains as one of my favourite places to dine.They have a fantastic antipasti buffet, I normally have to force myself to not take a second trip to in order to save room for the main. Their steaks and meat dishes are great and the choice of desserts never fails to please either. Perfect for dining with friends or for a romantic evening out with a partner. Basilico always makes for a very special evening

Detail review and photos:http://eatplaycook22.blogspot.sg/2014/08/eat-italian-buffet-basilico-regent.htmlHad a great time at Basilico during their lunch buffet. Authentic Italian spread with a variety choice of food. Food are prepared with fresh ingredients. We made reservation and table is prepared for us upon arrival.Some of the highlights during my visit:Seafood creamy pasta, Potato Gnocchi, Four Cheese Pizza, Vanilla Panna Cotta, Bourbon Creme Brulee, Grilled Chicken, stir fry beef with asparagus, mango sorbet.Service is attentive by Mr Justin, thumbs up! Other staff is also very friendly, one of them help to carry stroller up the stairs on our way into the restaurant. They also have a separate area at a corner dedicated for guest with kids which i think its great. Had a great dining experience with a great view of the pool.Kids under 5 eats for free :
5
the lunch buffet is amazing,antipasti, fish and meat at a stunning quality.Nice cheese table, cakes choice and good service in a luxurious location
5
we celebrated my husband's birthday there, both of us loved the food. Although we do not know the Italian name of every dish, we enjoyed it, very delicious
5
My kids and grandchildren just LOVE the buffet here! International buffet with every country represented! Special mention about their breads, especially the black squid ink bread, the best panacotta in town, the best and generous portion of hainanese chicken rice
4
Totally qualitative and various buffet appetizers, recomended. Dessert wonderful at sight, not completely adeguate taste. Restaurant have to be visited
5
What a yummy restaurant! Their lunch buffet is one of my favorites to hit in Singapore. They have three buffet lines - the "appetizer" line with antipasto, salad, meats, cheeses, breads, veggies; the main course line with a selection of Italian favorites, roast meat, and Asian picks; and the ever delicious dessert line with everything from baked goods to gelato. Just be sure to pace yourself so you have room for everything! Their dinner menu is delicious with a rotating menu to keep things fresh. It's a bit pricey but totally worth it
5
Warm hospitality and attentive service. Consistent good presentation and selection of Italian fare. The dinner menu offering for main course were a delight to choose from. The lamb dish was pleasantly done up and extremely tender. Will be back again!
1
Arrived at 2.15 wanting a quick bite but all the restaurants running no a la carteOpted for the brunch.By the time we went to the buffet for main courses Buffet was empty.Quality of food poor for mains however the antipasti was good.As no food left on the buffet asked for a fresh Gnochi which they proceeded to make out of a froZen bag. Nice ! Chefs munching away behind the counter , maybe that's why the food ran out .Needs some serious work to make it even nearly good !Pretty much a waste of money Put in a corner in a separate room that felt like a terrace but inside .The new bar looks great , hope they now focus in Basilico Won't be bac
5
Great selection of food available at Basilico. I have been there few times as it is our fav place for team eating out. I love the salad bar, dessert corner, grilled stations and asian cuisine. Even if I have been there at least 4 times but I never get bored with this place. Will def go back there again. Please make sure you reserve the table
5
The service is impeccable from the moment you step in. It's excellent. Even the chef pops by the say hi and everyone feels genuine.Food - we did the main course with the antipasti buffet and dessert buffet. The antipasti buffet consists of good quality cheeses, salads, variety of bread, meats and signature Italian antipasti including buffalo cheese with tomatoes. The dessert buffet was decent, not as many as those hotel buffet. There was cake, creme brûlée, ice cream, panna cotta.For the main, I had the grilled sea bass. I lapped it up, thankfully it wasn't a huge piece because I wanted to try more antipasti and dessert. My husband enjoyed his wagyu rump. The restaurant gave all its patron a slice of focaccia bread with mascarpone cheese and truffle oil, like a pizza. It was heavenly and we would just go back to eat that. Atmosphere for dinner - it is a nice place for couples to have a romantic meal, but it is also suitable for big groups and families. Pricing - worth it considering quality Italian food is expensive in Singapore, it is worth paying for Basilico. If you don'twant to eat too much, you can choose to have the two buffets without the main course
5
This is one of my (and my Italian family) preferred restaurants in Singapore. We use to go on Sunday for the brunch. Quality of food is outstanding. Some areas could improve, such as the cheeses, where some more variety would be appreciated. But overall food is simply great, and I often repeat coming to this restaurant. Service is also excellent. Ok, it s a bit pricey, but if I compare quality and price, I am ready to pay the price.So, personally, I strongly recommend this great Italian restauran
3
Being Italian I can tell that the only good food at Basilico is the antipasti buffet.I tried a couple of time to order a main a la carte but was absolutely bed. Also pizza is not good.Instead of taking so much care about the dressing code they should take more care about the quality of the food
4
Had a lovely Italian semi buffet dinner. The appetizer buffet was nice. Olive bread was excellent with the range of cheeses offered. Cold cuts were very nice. Had a steak which was nice although slightly too well done for me. The desserts were also rather nice. Service was very attentive. All in all, a nice dinner
4
We dined here while staying at the Regent on a recent holiday to Singapore. We went on a Saturday night and the restaurant was very busy but we were seated almost immediately. We chose the special which was the antipasti and dessert buffet with a choice of main course. Both my husband's Angus steak and my fish were nicely presented and very tasty. We enjoyed the selection of both buffets. Having eaten out in other restaurants during a stay, we found the prices at Basilico to be great value for money. The service was excellent, prompt and friendly and although it wasn't perhaps an intimate dinner setting because of the buffet, nevertheless we didn't feel the presence of the other diners
2
I was staying at the Regent Hotel and had arrived late in the evening, so I ate at Basilico out of convenience. The service was dreadful. We had to wave our arms in the air on several occasions in order to get any attention, and the meals for some of our guests arrived 10 minutes apart. There was nothing wrong with the food but the service needs serious attention.
5
From the moment you enter you are sourounded by all Italian cuisine.... from prosciutto cotto and crudo to all the variety of olive oil... the price is very reasonable... service is excellent...
P.S. don't forget to try a illy ristretto
5
Breakfast served there was excellent but this was nothing as compared to dinner there one night. Fantastic food and excellent service.

I have read so much great things about Basilico and finally had the chance to visit during the Restaurant Week. Perhaps its precisely that hence the standard of fare did not meet our expectations - from the buffet-style appetisers and desserts to the mains. The saving grace was the good service from the wait staff. Tables were placed so close together that it was impossible to have a decent conversation with your partner. Most of the time, we were listening in to our neighbor's loud conversation. In addition, through no fault of the wait staff, we had to wait almost 1.5 hours for our mains to be served. The excuse was a long list of orders to process. We were perfectly fine with the wait though. The problem started when our steaks were served. Our order was medium and the steaks were served almost well done. We sent back and the kitchen had the service staff to bring it back to us to show that it was medium right deep inside the piece of meat. First, I think we have dined in enough restaurants and cooked enough steaks at home to tell what is medium and what is well done. Second, for a five star establishment, that is the last thing I would expect. By the time we finished our mains, the desserts counter was left with little leftovers because it was so late. All in all, not a good experience for us. I don't know, perhaps if it wasn't part of the Restaurant Week, the quality might have been a lot better. For the price we paid including a bottle of wine, I think we might have enjoyed more at their famed Sunday brunch

We have been wanting to dine at this classy and elegant Italian restaurant for a while, what more, enjoy a good Italian buffet. So here we are finally.So, it works this way - order a main course, and one is entitled to the Buffet selection at the round counter. We had thought that it was an entirely Italian buffet concept, counters filled with platters of different Italian pizzas and pastas, but it was not so. Nonetheless, we ordered a Main Course each, and then went ahead to attack the buffet bar.The mains came. One of the items was the gigantic and thickly-crusted woodfire Squid Ink Pizza with Smoked Salmon and caviar - delicious, but mostly because of the sumptuous factor from the salmon and caviar. The crust was a little thick for my liking, and "squid ink" could not be tasted though it is rather evident in color. I thought it was a tad dry, but we were assured that traditional, authentic woodfire Italian pizzas are such - so we learned to enjoy the moment and chew.Finally, my King Scallops - a mouthwatering, grilled dish of succulent, juicy, bouncy pieces of heaven served on sticks. Yes, they were huge, and each bite was a delight. The scallops tasted of the sweet, faint distinct metallic taste of seafood that I absolutely adore, and the bouncy meat was meltingly soft. This was the winner of all four, for sure - and the only one that got polished 100% (duh!)For more detailed information and photos, do pop in:http://thearcticstar.blogspot.sg/2013/12/dinner-at-basilico-restaurant-at-regent.htm

I must say, i go there from time to time and i never get out disappointed. i went for Sunday Branch and the selection of food is absolutely outstanding. you will find cheese in there that are difficult to find even in Italy, selection from everywhere in Italy.The risotto with truffles is a must and when you finish with all the main course and you start with the dessert, you just wish you did not eat that much before, because they are out of this world.Service always very professional and kind

Stayed at the Regent hotel and this restaurant is a jewel. The staff is fabulous and the chefs really care about what they put out. It is a fabulous buffet style dinner but not your average buffet by any stretch of the imagination. Loved it so much we have went back several time

I went to Basilico for the lunch buffet to celebrate a special event. After the excellent experience, here are five reasons why I would recommend Basilico to a friend and why I will definitely visit again. 1.) Location: Regent Hotel is quite a distance from the craziness of the city centre. Even if Tanglin is still in the city area, you wouldn't be stressed by the volume of the crowd. The hotel itself is also impressive! There is the wow factor as soon as you enter the lobby. It's not very surprising though given that Regent Hotel is a Four Seasons Hotel. I loved that the hotel lobby was very relaxed. It was the complete opposite of Marina Bay Sands, which is like a marketplace. LOL! 2.) Friendly staff: Two hours before our reservation time, I called Basilico just to confirm that my reservation via Chope was reservation. I spoke to a very nice lady who assured me that I will have the spot I requested for. She also reminded me about the request I made for a small slice of cake because we were celebrating. When we arrived at the venue, we were about 15 minutes early but the friendly staff behind the reception were all smiles and nicely asked us as well as other dining guests to wait a bit since the restau opens at 12 noon and they were still preparing the place. I also loved how the lady asked if I was Angelo. It's either she was the one who picked up my call or I was the only Filipino who made a reservation. LOL! 3.) Restau interiors: The setup of restaurant itself was elegant but not snobbish at all. I didn't feel the need to arrive at the restau in a suit. LOL! Most of the other diners were in their relaxed Saturday brunch attire. The place could probably seat about 100 people (but that's just a guess). The buffet spread is located just after you enter the restau. It excites guests immediately and makes your eyes do a quick scan of the sumptuous offerings. 4.) Food: Oh my gosh! I have nothing but good words for the food. Basilico is an Italian buffet restaurant and if you're a lover of Italian cuisine, then this is the buffet place to visit. The antipasti section was heaven! A lot of choices to choose from. I loved that even though there were many choices, it doesn't overwhelm guests. You can go around and have a little bit of everything and still have room for dessert. I definitely enjoyed everything from the appetiser to the mains to the dessert. 5.) Price: For Saturday brunch, the price for the buffet alone was $54. If you want free flow drinks, it's $68 if I remember correctly. And if you want free flow prosecco or wine, it's $128. With the fantastic buffet, $54 plus tax and service was a small amount to pay. The place doesn't burn a hole in your pocket. Hehe! Will definitely be back

As European I am spoiled with original Italian food. The Basilico restaurant inside the Regent hotel offers Italian food that is Italian food and prepared by Italian chefs. Concept of antipasta buffet with selection of main course is great. However, the wine in Italy is much cheaper
4
We only had breakfast at Basilico on our recent stay at the Regent. It is very sumptuous and has many varieties of dishes. A nice touch was the chef coming out and talking to guests ensuring that everything was ok. Will defiantly try brunch or dinner there next time
4
Had a conference here and ate lunch 2 days in a row. The spread and quality is decent - they have prosciutto ham, a range of cheeses, italian favorites like pasta and risotto, and some carved meat like roast chicken and beef. While decent, it's not excellent. They seem to be slow on refilling emptying sections of the food, and the type of dishes remained mostly the same over the 2 days i was there. Service can also get a bit gruff, the service staff are quite curt if you're in their way, or misplaced the tongsDessert was a range of italian favorites like tiramisu etc, and the ice cream which i didn't try was apparently too sweet according to my colleague
5
A really excellent buffet with a huge choice of starters and mains. As ever the service was excellent and the food very tasty.
4
Basilico offers a fine spread of Italian food.
Service is prompt and attentive.
Staff were well trained to assist.
Quality food at a comfortable atmosphere.
4
Stayed at The Regent for 2 weeks on holidays. My wife & I ate at the Basilico just about every morning. The wait staff was really good & we became friends with a few getting to know them on a personal level. Like most of the staff we came in contact with at the hotel, they were extremely attentive & anticipated our requirement
3
Dinner there was mostly worth it for the starters buffet. Main dish was not very good, and service was not efficient. Price ok
5
Possibly the best in Singapore for lunch or dinner buffets. Breakfast is hit and miss due to limited variety. If you like Italian and Mediterranean food, then you will appreciate Basilico as well as the smaller cafe in the lobby for quick meals, snacks and takeaways. For breakfast, the limited variety on offer (compared with Marriott or Shangri-la, for example) means for example you will not always be able to have a proper English breakfast (which the others can guarantee down to the HP sauce). Ditto for Japanese and other types of breakfast, it depends on what is on offer. On my last visit they had two types of chicken sausage (yuck- artificial) and no pork sausage. Cold cuts variety was also poor. Plain yoghurt was not on display, only sweet ones. Cheese selection was poor. However on other occasions this has been fantastic. Service is otherwise excellent, to Four Seasons standards
5
Our family of 12 have dined together at a hotel restaurant, every Xmas Eve/Day for the past 15 years.We chose Basilico again this year (2013), after an outstanding dining experience on Xmas Eve 2012.We did not think it possible, but our enjoyment yesterday evening surpassed that of last year !!The food (Italian champagne/wine buffet dinner), ambiance and service were outstanding.Our special thanks to Mr Gibson our waiter for the evening, who was competent in every way: efficient, pleasant, attentive yet unobtrusive...indeed Gibson was everything excellent.It was a unanimous decision: our family will be making an early booking for dinner at Basilico, for Xmas Eve 2014.Thank you very much indeed
5
 From breakfast to lunch to dinner, the variety and quality of cuisine is excellent. The dinner buffer features main course selections cooked to order from a different region of Italy each month. Sunday brunch is too good to miss, with an extravaganza of high quality well prepared and presented cuisine with over 35 Italian cheeses
4
I ate breakfast and dinner at Basilico and recommend it for both. The buffet breakfast in the morning is a great spread and the Italian food in the evening is very well prepared.
5
First-rate food, service and ambience at this well-managed restaurant. Excellent choice for our Specal Occasion dinner. Prices are not too high for such a nice dining venue. Overall, we found it quite good value. After buying a bottle of Tuscany Red from the Restaurant's Wine List, we were not charged the S$40 corkage fee for the Champagne we had brought. Missed the Foie Gras which is only available at the Weekend Buffet
4
Very Good service and food.very welcoming.beautiful' selections cheeses........'ll be back soon.............
5
This restaurant offers an interesting concept, a buffet all you can eat starter and main, or an all you can eat buffet starter with an a la carte main course/dessert.The food offered, even on the buffet is of an exceptional quality. An excellent choice of antipasti and cheese for starters.Good quality a la carte menu, steak comes highly recommended and cooked nicely.Service attentive but not intrusive, well polished. Would eat here again
5
I came to the resturant with some workmates for a team event which was throughly enjoyed by all. Chef Luca was great. The team was still raving about the risotto we made a week later
5
I'm writing this review mainly as a public thank you to the staff of Basilico, from the polite and efficient receptionist who called to confirm my reservation and to offer a special surprise for the birthday dinner, to the excellent waitressing that was attentive but non-intrusive. My family enjoyed the sumptious spread, and special mention goes to the home-made lychee sorbet that got us going for multiple servings. The antipasti was a good spread and the choices of seasonings was a pleasant indication of the attention to detail by the chef(s). The desserts were enticing and tasted even better. One comment I would make for the beef tenderloin was that it was a bit overcooked for a medium, and would've been better if slightly pink. Other than that it was a dinner to remember. Thank you for the experience

Nice service... food is ok.. but not going to go out of your way for this place... its a busy place... without enough light and which to be honest has too many people for the ammount they can realistically service... also had NO IDEA what I wast talking about when I requested Eggs Benedict... REALLY? - At a four seasons hotel???
4
The ambiance is conducive and service is 5-star hotel standard. The buffet spread is extensive comprises most elaborated antipasti (even multiple types of salt flakes! ), regional and seasonal fresh greens, four to five types of tomatoes. The cold crab, lobster, mussels, scallops, live cooking of meat, floe gras, pizza and pasta, sumptuous beef, lamb, chicken, ham and bone mallow are a feast for the sense and we were spoiled for choices. Most interesting is their cheese room, squid ink bread and pizza and the heavenly Millis coffee iced cream, homemade gelato, Italian cakes, tarts and chocolates...beware of over-indulgent! A great place to celebrate special occasion and let yourself go, once in a while. About S$100 per head without wine, great value for money
5
We went for the Sunday brunch to celebrate a birthday, and it was a most enjoyable experience. The selection of Italian cow/sheep/goats cheeses is the best we have ever seen, and extremely delicious. Apart from the cheeses we particularly enjoyed the bone marrow, foie gras, Boston lobster claws, scallops, lamb chops, artichoke dip , not to mention the numerous delicious desserts. Excellent and attentive service. Highly Recommended
4
Diverse offerings of Italian fare that is fresh and served in an appetizing manner. Most offerings are tasty and the service is personable, friendly and inviting
4
The atmosphere is good, you can sit both inside and outside.they serve a proper italian thin crust pizza.right on Orchard road, so plenty things to see while you are eatin
5
Great variety of Italian foods - hot and cold with Asian if liked. Great choices and good place for a business meeting or ladies out for lunch
4
Came here for the breakfast buffet. The spread is excellent with a choice of Japanese, Chinese, MIddle-Eastern and continental dishes.Coffee is great the first time round though it was not so for the second helping. Could be a different barista doing it.It was expensive, though
5
Seriously the best pasta station, the pizza super fresh and surprised you will find super fresh smoked Buffalo Mozzarella on the cold buffet....
4
Went with friends, a compact yet not over-crowded place! Nice selections of food, everything tastes greats!! Our private/group is right in the middle of the wine cellar so try that if you had the chance!! Be sure to leave some space for desserts
4
was there for a friend birthday, The food with lots of choice and amazing spread of choices. planing to go back to try dinner next time 
5
It's harder to find a good buffet restaurant in a hotel than one thinks. Our experience at Basilico at Regent Singapore was a fantastic one at lunch. Staff were very friendly, from the entrance of the restaurant throughout the whole lunch. Quick to respond, close when you need one, never intruding when you're in the thick of conversation.The antipasti section was comprehensive, with a wide variety of Italian cheeses, hams, great smoked salmon... The mains were not to be outdone. Delicious pastas done in small pots al dente, the Aglio Olio and Gnocchi in pesto cream were my favourites. There was also a nice selection of freshly baked pizzas, the Quattro Formaghi my choice of the day. Grilled beef and roast pork belly were also very well done.To my surprise, there was also a local food section. There was beautiful braised pork, and a nice and savoury Kung Pao chicken which we enjoyed.The climax of the day? Something very unusual for me though, as I am definitely not one to insist on desserts. At the insistence of the restaurant's GM, David, one of an entire community of Italians running the restaurant; I obliged. I tried the pistachio cake, the tiramisu, the blackforest, as well as the madelienes. The pistachio and tiramisu were 5 stars, the blackforest and the madeleines were a tad above average.I haven't been here since a year ago, I can only say it's still great, if not better. Definitely among my top chioces if you're looking for a good hotel buffet
5
The burrata cheese is worth the price of brunch alone, but the kids love the homemade gelato and meringues and the play room. Pastas are sometimes not that creative, but there is always more than you can try in one sitting anyway
4
Breakfast buffet offers a wide variety of breakfast food. We enjoy the egg station along with the ham. Staff is friendly
5
I am not a great lover of buffets but the lunchtime buffet offered by the Basilico restaurant on Saturdays is superb. The theme is Italian and the quality of the food is outstanding: as you would expect, a wide range of starters (without too much emphasis on seafood), excellent hot main courses (although the carvery roasts could have been hotter) and desserts to die for. A selection of Italian cheeses is also on offer. What made this buffet exceptional for me was the free-flow Prosecco AND white/red wines. Personally, I do not like drinking bubbly throughout a meal so the ability to switch to a choice of very good wines was a winner. Few buffets offer this. Finally, the service was excellent and the price sensible (for Singapore!)
4
Went to Basilico on a Saturday for lunch, they have a buffet so we got to try a number of dishes. Overall the food is excellent, I tried nearly every dish that they had to offer and was surprised at how every dish was well made. They have a wide selection of meats, a few pizzas, pasta, large selection of cheeses and antipasto dishes. Dessert selection is very good and the gelato can't be missed...reminded me of the best gelato I had while in Italy a few years ago.Service on the other hand was not impressive. The gentleman who seated us was far too pretentious and the regular staff did not seem attentive...they missed basic things like folding our napkins when we left the table and did not refill our glasses of water. The only positive aspect of the service was their ability to clear quickly.For this reason I give Basilico 4*, however I do highly recommend it if you are missing good Italian food and have a big appetite
4
The place is OK, considering it covers the needs of the hotel for breakfast etc.The food quality and taste wise is very, very good (8 out of 10).Only thing I would note is that the service is not at its best. They dont feel (or act restaurant trained, if you know what I mean).Or maybe the food quality is too high to compare with the rest.....Very well done for a hotel restaurant, would definitely recommend it!!!

We came to basillico for the lunch buffet on sunday to celebrate our anniversary and was sadly not as impressed as our first visit 6 months ago for dinner.The pork ribs and the lamb chops was quite dry and there isn't any chicken dish at all. My partner was disappointed as the reason for choosing basilico was mainly for the meat dishes. ( we had a very good lamb chop the first visit) They were very generous with the pan fried foie gras but the consistency wasn't there- some parts were burnt but nonetheless delicious. The cod fish and truffle risotto were excellent. Dessert was excellent esp the pistachio gelato. But again were disappointed as there isn't any tiramisu which are to die for.Overall we had an okay experience but would expect a better quality food from the hefty price tag and a larger selection of dessert. I have to compliment the staff Gwen with her excellent service.(the same waitress that waits in our table 6mths ago) She was very attentive to our needs and was able to anticipate our needs. Knowing that we were celebrating out anniversary she gave us a slice of cake with candle on it, saying happy anniversary
5
Excellent food and service. Pricing very reasonable. Walked in without reservations for lunch and I was seated immediately. No fusses. A must try for sure.
5
I had the opportunity to visit Basilico during Restaurant Week & thoroughly enjoyed my dinner there. The appeitiser & buffet spead was more than sufficient & i must say, excellent! Wide variety of cheeses & ham to select from. I love the tiramisu! My main course (fish) was good too & portion was just right.The service staff were very attentive & friendly, an aspect always appreciated in Singapore. We also managed to have a short chat with the head Italian chef who was very friendly as well. He even gave us free special desserts.I would definitely head there for dinner again on special occasions

My wife and her friends have enjoyed Basilico several times for group luncheons and consistently rave about it. With company visiting us, we decided to try it for dinner last night. Based on the imagery portrayed on the Regent Hotel web site and price range, we were expecting a high-end, fine dining experience. Upon entering the restaurant, red flags immediately went up. We had to maneuver through a hoard of people racing to and fro amidst the buffet offerings (the menu has a deal with a buffet appetizer and an a la carte main plate). While the local people seemed to be dressed up, many of the foreigners (I am a foreigner living here in Singapore as a PR, so I think I can call this out) were dressed in shorts, sandals (flip flops), T-shirts, etc.....they look like slobs to be honest; completely inappropriate for a high-end restaurant. (Note to Regent's management: If you are going to charge the prices that you do at Basilico, please enforce a a dress code. The Billabong shorts (or were they a swim suit?) and 2 day old T-shirt just doesn't belong on anyone at your dining establishment. The service was hit-or-miss; either the staff was all over you at the table or they were nowhere to be seen when appetizer plates had been laying there uncollected for 10-15 minutes. The food was okay but nothing stood out. The Buffalo mozzarella was fresh but the tomatoes accompanying it were mushy. The Pizza Fra Diavolo was wet. The baked Cod lacked any flavor whatsoever. The seafood risotto was okay, but heavy on the salt. The beef carpaccio was skimpy with the meat and they tried to fill out the appearance of the plate with more arugula than you would eat in a month. Overall, it was average food in a setting one would expect in a shopping mall restaurant. Theer are plenty of other places in Singapore that offer a nice atmosphere for dinner in this price range. This one comes off our list
4
We did not try the menu items, but Basilico offers a wonderful buffet with incredibly fresh choices. It's so often difficult to find a fresh salad in Singapore. But here, you'll get a great assortment of lettuces, arugula, and other greens. Plus four different types of tomatoes - all delicious. They also have many kinds of cheeses including sweet & nutty fresh Mozzerella and succulent Parmiggiano. I lived in Italy for many years, and Basilico is as good as some of my favorite places in Rome or Tuscany. The service is gracious, friendly, and attentive. Highly recommend

Disclaimer: I am Italian, so high standards for authenticity.This restaurant is a tale of two cities. The buffet is good. Stay away from the overly complicated stuff where many favors get mixed and stick to the simple ingredients. Then it will be an excellent experience. The fresh cheeses, the Parma ham, the mortadella, the olives are very, very good. I suspect most of these ingredient are flown in directly. I found the Parmesan somewhat plasticky and the pizza bread not crisp.The dishes in the a la carte menu are "international Italian". I suggest to pass. There are no favors from home. I have been three times a my colleagues at work like this restaurant so my sample base is now large enough. Better stick with the buffet.The dessert bar looks attractive. I found the sfogliatelle not very fresh. They must have been two or three days old.Finally, the wine compartment is very disappointing. The wine list is short and of three wines I asked only one was available. The red wine was brought in chilled. This is quite common in most of Asia but one would think that a place that styles itself as Italian would know and do better.The service is attentive, eager, but poorly trained in what they are serving
5
I was invited to Basilico at the Regent hotel from a old friend for a Italian dinner, and it was Incredible. The restaurant (one of the best Italian I can remember, even better than in Italy itself), is stunning with a center buffet of freshly prepared Italian antipasti, sea food cheeses, Parma ham, salami. You just can’t stop.The bread selection is very good too, particularly the squid ink and anchovy bread.The main course is plated and you can choice from the menu a la carte, I went for the seabass which was perfectly cooked, juicy and flavorful.The head chef Ciccone brought us some special pizza stuffed with truffle cheese, which was to die for.By the end we didn’t have any space to delight into the dessert buffet and we settle for some good home made ice cream.Very good service too.I wish we had a restaurant like this in Hong kong
4
I love their mozzarella, carpaccio, ham & melon...mniam. seafood starters not so good. main dishes choice is not as great though panfried foie-gras or pork belly was good. the finish was fantastic with choice from over 30 cheeses and delicious deserts. now, it is a pricy place. family of 4 with drinks needs to count more than 300SGD for lunch (kids pay half)
5
If you like Italian food then this is heaven.Cold cuts, loads of mozzarella, fresh tomatoes, olive bread, artichoke ..... And this is just the salad bar. Loads of great ravioli pitons, pizza, beef roast, ribs etc etc ....then there are the freshly made desserts. Ricotta cheese cake is a must....For cheat days only
5
We met for a Girls' Club Lunch. The Italian buffet at Basilico was amazing. The anti-pasta, flavoured olive oils, balsamics, hams, olives, and hors d'oeuvres were so gorgeous I couldn't quite fit in some of the wonderful looking pasta and meat dishes. I did manage a helping (or two) of the amazing desserts though ...... the tiramisu is to die for!The staff were so friendly and welcoming. We were there just before Christmas and I loved the decorations and gingerbread candy houses in the foyer so much too, that I returned a few days later with my daughter and husband and we had their festive afternoon tea. Which was also brilliant.Thanks Regent
4
Recent visit for lunch with large party of friends was an overall very good experience. Everyone loved the selection of antipasti, hot dishes and desserts. We thoroughly enjoyed ourselves in our "private dining room". The drawback was the service - although good for part of the lunch...we seemed to have been forgotten half way through it. With this large a group I would expect more attentive service. And alcohol prices are very high. $25-$30 for a glass of wine...really? This will not deter me though to revisit Basilico as its generally a very positive experience attributed mainly to the food - Go for the food. Graci Luco
5
you will Not be disapointed best place to eat in Sigapore but remember to book, the food was amazing the staff could not be any more helpfull a great night out for two or a group ..
5
A very pleasant meal with a nice ambience. Good wine list that provides good choice of both fine white and red wines.
4
I have been twice to this restaurant, both times for the buffet lunch; the Saturday is slightly cheaper than the Sunday. Both times it was heavily booked with many family groups and well-heeled hotel residents. The food is, simply, excellent. Curries, seafood, roast meats, accompaniments, bread, cheeses, starters, puds. On a Sunday there is even pan-fried foie gras....and you can go back as often as you wish. Service is brisk rather than friendly, but always polite. Advice on dishes is available from the many chefs tending the buffet. Inevitably, it is expensive and the wine list is prohibitive. You need to be seriously hungry and have enough time to pace yourself if you are going to get 'value' for money, but the experience is a must have. Why on earth do these places not offer a modest carafe of house wine
5
The foie gras station at the Sunday brunch is special. Excellent spread of Italian cheeses (including yummy burata!). We also went there for dinner during the week (half-buffet style); the main courses (pastas and others) are also excellent. Service is what you can expect at buffet or semi-buffet restaurants - competent albeit not super attentive
3
For a girls lunch out, we wanted to treat ourselves to something very special this Sunday. Basilico, located on the 2nd floor of a lavish Regent Hotel, serves all-you-can-eat fancy lunch buffets, and it seemed to fit the occasion.A couple of ladies were a little disappointed that there were no brunch items on the menu, like waffles, or crepes, but the wide selection of other dishes more than made up for the lack of your traditional omelet. I'm a fan of seafood, and was especially impressed by their fresh salmon carpaccio, variety of shellfish, and marinated anchovies. The best part of the buffet by far was the cheese room (it's hidden in the back..if my friend hadn't told me about it, I would have missed it!). They have a selection of 15+ cheeses, coupled with fancy topping, such as truffle honey or fig confit... mmm... delicious!Unfortunately, there was no service at the tables whatsoever. During the 1.5 hours at the restaurant, no waiter took an initiative to stop by our table to ask if we need water, etc. Every time I needed refill of water, or a cup of coffee, I had to get up, and look for someone who could help. I had to ask three times, three separate waiters for coffee before I was offered a cup. Being surrounded by such fancy decor and fantastic foods, it was very disappointing to be completely ignored by the staff. I'm probably not going to visit basilico again
5
I went there during the week for lunch and was amazed by the variety of food that was offered. Huge antipasti buffet with cold cuts, cheese, grilled veggies, anchovies etc. The "main-course" buffet had various types of pizza, pasta, seafood, meat - way too much to try it all. Desert buffet was heaven, try the Tiramisu. A coffee was included to round things up. It's around 50 SGD per person including service, so not the every day lunch but you will get your money's worth.I heard that for dinner, there is only an antipasti buffet and the rest is a la cart. I can't judge that
4
Went on a saturday for brunch with the wifey. Reservations highly recommended due to popularity of the restaurant during wkend brunch. For the brunch price we paid (~SG$50++ per person), the spread was great. A good selection of appetizers, cold-cuts, cheese, anti-pasti - very good quality ingredients. The lobster bisque was excellent! The pizza was nice. But the meats on the grill was somewhat dry and the pasta dishes was only so-so - the lasagna didnt have alot of flavor and the aglio olio pepperoncino was way too spicy, even for local standards). That said, the dessert selection was superb. Overall, it was a very nice experience and I would go there again, without a doubt. Ambiance is also good and a casual meal with friends would be perfect
4
A Italian Sunday brunch is a nice change from the vast choice of brunch buffets in Singapore. Great choice of starters and salads, first and second courses for the mains and a desert buffet that adds the final calories. All presented nicely, fresh and of very good quality. Service is good, but could be a bit more attentive and faster. Same applies for the pasta bar, all extra wishes are being followed, but it takes a reminder or 2 to get there. Anyway, the atmosphere is nice, not too large and therefore not as crowded as say the Shangri-La
5
Of all the brunch locales I've visited in Sing,apore, this one is my favorite. It may not be as large as some of the other hotels but the quality is exquisite. The breads, cheeses, meats, stews, pizza, desserts, etc. all taste incredible. Honestly, I know pizza, bread, and cheese aren't what people usually go for at a Sunday Brunch, but they really know how to work wonders with bread and cheese there! The food was fresh and very tasty and the ambience was elegant yet relaxing! I will definitely be back again
4
Came in for lunch after a bit of shopping. Restaurant has nice decor, good ambience, cozy seatings, food selections were great and of good quality. Service was prompt and attentive. We were seated inside near the glass doors overlooking the swimming pool.Majority of the buffet is authentic Italian spread with a small selection of Asian dishes such as curry and stir fries. Overall experience is FANTASTIC!! give it a try and make sure you save some room for desserts
4
Great and varied menu. But being at a top hotel it is kind of expensive. Woth the cost but be sure to try at "hawker stands" which are famous street vendors also at the other end of the price scale.
2
Despite is located on the Regent Hotel, the quality of food and service is poor.
5
so happy to find fresh Italian tomatoes and cheeses (Burrata, smoked buffalo Mozarella, Ricotta, etc). The dessert buffet is good too. It's our quarterly dinner place, since we will be happily fat if we go too often :-)
4
Good food and great setting in the regent hotel downtown Singapore. The buffet of appetizers and sweets offers a decent but not large selection. The prices are high but as expected though considering everything. I would go back.
3
Went for dinner and was quite disappointed by the buffet, the quality is rather good but not so many choices of desserts.Setting is nice but a bit dark and facing the old pool..
4
Have eaten here many times, and can honsestly say that breakfast, lunch and dinner are all good here.The buffett is good value for money and I always fine the quality of the food to be of a high standard.Whilst not the best Itallian food I have had in Singapore, it certainly does not disappoint and is worth a visit
3
Weirdly designed roundish restaurant that clearly had never been envisioned as an Italian restaurant when the hotel was build. Mixed interior with a large domineering central buffet. The central airconditioning set to polar. Not very cozy, at all. Helpfull and attentive staff however, a good wine list and fantastic decanters. We tried the Barolo (2000). The menu is varied and the portions generous but just off in original taste. The Tira Misu watery but the cheese selection very good..
4
It is my first time going to there to have lunch with my friend as she wants to give me a treat for my belated birthday. As a regular and simple foodie like me, I explore all kinds of cuisine except the really exotic ones. It was my first visit to Basilico at the Regent Hotel Singapore as the place is tuck away from the bustling Orchard Road. I was also surprised that Basilico is one of the very few Italian restaurants that serves buffet for lunch. I really like the classic Neapolitan style pizzas, wagyu beef lasagne, Italian pasta and some local dishes. They were tasty, simple and selections of food was just nice and decent. I wouldnt want to have so much food spread as one tend to get sleepy after a hearty lunch. Overall, my friend and I were satisfied with the quality, service and selection of food. The one thing I want to point out was the desserts tasted too sweet and the spread was not fantastic nor look appealing. Hope I could see more dessert selections and taste less sweet
2
This is my 2nd visit to the restaurant and found that the standard is far from my 1st visit 3 months ago. Although the price remain the same,the selection of food is no way to match with my first visit. No oysters on the buffet table and the rate of replenishing the lobster is extremely slow. In fact I didn't see any replenishment of the item after my first round despite numerous requests made to the staff (including restaurant manager). I felt strongly that based on the menu, it shouldn't command such price

I had always loved the anti-pasti and main course offerings in Basilico. This time, I took my Italian boss who was visiting town to Basilico and he found the food authentic. He pointed me to several delicacies that tasted quite good. Even the capers had a special ting to it. The special hand made pasta with wagyu cheek beef was superb! and the dessert spread had a great selection of sorbet and other delights

there is absolutely nothing to dislike about at this place. one of my favorite italian restaurant, almost as good as Hilton's italian restaurant il Cielo

I went to Basilico last Sunday for Easter Brunch, I have to say that I was amazed by the quality of the food selection. Chef Angelo was very pleasant with the familly. I loved the Dry Aged Beef at the carving station... Nice selection of seafood and Dessert. Service was nice and pleasant. will come back for sur

I went expecring disappointment. After all this is your standard 'international' hotel trying to cater for business travellers from every country in the world. The staff is just as broad. So don't expect gondolas delivering you meal to the strains of O Solo Mio. Instead expect exceptional Italian food served in a buffet format with a staff properly trained to concentrate on your comfort rather than seeking to fulfil a visual fantasy.

This is a fantastic restaurant with wonderful Italian Chef but very low standard service.No one for the management came to see us, the staff service was without guide.Only Chef angelo was around the only one that put his face for apologize.What is missing in this place is the Italian Charming, if you go around singaporethe only succes restaurant got an Italian Manager look Otto restaurant L'Angolo Restaurant Osvaldo Restaurant.You must search for an Italian Restaurant Manager that really know how run Italian Restaurant

Saturday Buffet:Impressive selection of Italian food! Fresh mozzarella and sliced tomatoes, lobster bisque, wagyu beef meatballs, variety of cheeses, cured meat (and melon for the prosciutto), fruit preserves- all taste so delicious! No room for pizzas & pastas but according to my friend they were delicious (he particularly loved the cheese pizza). The dessert was nice as well (tiramisu, ice cream, and a custardy type*not sure what it’s called). The fact that the dessert is bite-sized allows room to try at least a few different types. It’s a bit pricey but most restaurants in 5-star hotels in S’pore are pricey. Between the 2 of us, total bill was approximately $120 (that's without alcohol).Couple things that I felt are missing: I’m a fan of cheese and crackers and although they have about 4 different types, I find their crackers are a bit boring and stale. I was expecting to find mousse or liver pate but didn’t see any (is it possible they ran out?). Next time I will try the Sunday buffett

If you are a fan of foie gras, then you will be quite happy in Basilico on a Sunday. The restaurant offers a Sunday Brunch buffet with all you can eat foie gras. If you prefer, you can also opt for Champagne brunch that includes free flow of bubbly.I have not been to the restaurant on a non-Sunday, and my opinions are only based on my rather frequent Sunday brunches. For me, the attraction is the foie gras - pan-seared, unlimited supply of artery-clotting, possibly stroke/heart-attack inducing goodness. There is a corner in the restaurant that is dedicated to this sin, together with an assortment of cheeses. The glass walls keep the smell away from the main dining area, but if you want the good stuff, you have to run the gauntlet of the overpowering fumes. The smell just gets onto everything - your clothes, your hair - literally everything. So if you have an important meeting (what? on a Sunday?) or an important date to impress, stay far away from the foie gras room.The rest of the buffet is based largely on italian cuisine and I do fancy the traditional-tasting italian dishes available. Pizzas and pastas are of course available and quite good. My champagne drinking friends love the champagne buffet, but I cannot vouch for that as I hardly take alcohol. If you are bringing children, you can ask for outdoor seating and there is lots of room for the young ones to run around. Only problem is it will be hard to get the attention of the wait staff.Access: Wheel-chair accessible

My wife and I went here for Valentine's day. We have been looking for a really good Italian restaurant in Singapore for the past 2 years and are continually disappointed, so when we saw the rating on Trip Advisor we were excited. There was a big buffet for the appetizers and dessert, but I must say most items were average. For the main course, we both ordered fish dishes and both were underseasoned and a little bland. For the price we paid, certainly not up to snuff. The search continues

We (Michael & myself) had lunch at Basilico during the Diningcityrestaurant week in Singapore and were pleasantly surprised. The Italianbuffet is really amazingly good with a large spread of antipasti dishes- cured meats, fish, olives, mozzarella and other cheeses, salads,condiments, lovely chutneys to go with the cheeses, bread, pizza.The warm dishes are pretty good as well although my personal favoritesare the antipasti dishes. But we tried some meat, roast potatoes andpasta dishes.And to end everything there was a lovely dessert buffet with Italiancookies, ice-cream and some cakes.All in all a recommendation looking at the food. Unfortunately theinterior is really hotel-like with dark brown and brass elements. Notvery contemporary

One of the things I hate about a restaurant, is when they make you choose between Buffett or Ala Carte. My family and I are very fussy eaters, and have a number of different tastes and allergies, but mainly we are all lactose intolerant. Most times, we find Buffett's to be a waste of money as half the food does not appeal to us. One of the best things about Basilico is that you can have bother the Buffett and an Ala Carte selection as one meal. All dietary requirements are catered for, and the service staff ensure that you leave happier than when you walked in. The quality of hams, salads, breads (to die for), and seafood is amazing, and so is the desert! We literally only go to Singapore to eat at this restaurant! Nothing comes close

I went with my colleague to basilico friday night and we were welcome and served by one of the manager (Quentin); courteous, french gentleman, knowledgeable on all questions we had and even more! VERY IMPRESSIVE!I left the restaurant happy and with more knowledge!!!! THIS IS WHAT A RESTAURANT SHOULD DO AT ALL TIME!I will be back for him! believe me. ask for him!beside that, the main course served at the table was tremendously flavourful, fresh. exquisite!If you don't want to go for the full menu (buffet appetizer, dessert and main course) you should go for one thing. Or the dessert if you are more a sweet person otherwise the appetizer is more than enough for a Normal stomach lol and the quality is there!! (compare to other downtown buffet!!)I could talk for hours on my dinner experience as it was unforgettable.if you have to bring friend or clients or lovers do so!!!! very good restauran

I had dinner there one evening with my colleagues. The sea bass (main course) was very nice. We got our appetizer and dessert from a buffet counter. There're a lot to choose from. The Pitaschio ice cream is nice.

Wide range of food. The cheeses and fresh lobster were outstanding. The desserts were good too.

I had lunch at Basilico, which display a fantastic buffet, with really fresh salad bar, and really good grill meat.
The service was good too, except the lady manager which sees very rude, and talk inappropiate to our table..

If you miss Italy, that is the location to find all together in a single place: from a long variety of cheeses, crudo, mortadella, burrata, great wines, risotto and pasta prepared as ordered...
All original and well prepared, really Good!

Nice buffet for lunch. Loved the spread of meats...I'm a carnivore! Parma ham, italian sausages, lamb, pork etc...service was excellent. Will certainly come back again.

Don't usually eat Singapore hotel breakfasts - S$40 or more is extravagant for a croissant and a bowl of fruit, so I usually end up making a pig of myself to get value for money. And this is the place to do this, believe me. Service great too. Tempted to do it every time

Stayed three days at Regent on a business trip. Love the food at the Italian restaurant Basilico. Very fresh and tasty, lots of imported cheese and ham's from Italy. Beautiful decor, good service, and Chef angelos truffle pasta was outstanding.Worth of a comeback to Singapore for it

Brilliant breakfast and don't miss the cappuchino out here... wow just mind blowing.. great ambience and a fun place to have a quite evening... No matter i stayed at the best hotel of Singapore but my mornings were dedicated to Basilico for the sumptous breakfast that was served out there and the chef had great food to offer on the Menu as the day would start proceeding.. its located at a great junction where you would feel the hussle bussel of the city... but i must say i had the best breakfast ever was only at Basilico.. so go for it early birds coz this is where your mornings would start sweet..

Basilico's is Italian fine dining in a hotel setting. We went to both the Sunday brunch buffet and a Evening dinner buffet.Besides high quality food, very friendly service and a good setting, what makes it outstanding in Singapore is that you will get execellent value for money especially if you do not want to take the free-flow Champagne option for the brunch or dont feel like drinking in the evening.Highly recommended
