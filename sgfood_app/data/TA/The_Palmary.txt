Good service, great food, love the the signature cocktails. My boyfriend and I celebrated Christmas at The Palmary and we truly enjoyed our visit.

Ambience & food was unique and pleasant. To top it off, the staff were friendly, helpful and keen to gather feedback. Kudos!

This is my repeat visit. The boss is as friendly and recommendations were still as good. 1 improvement though: try not to make the starters too "simple" looking.

This new restobar ups the dining scene in the quaint neighbourhood another notch. Prices are very reasonable for the generous portions served and their young friendly owners will make sure your dining experience is truly enjoyable. There is even a cosy upper level for private functions and events

My wife and I recently had New Year's Eve dinner at Palmary. We chanced across this place based on the good reviews online as well as a friend's recommendation on FB.As it was NYE, we made reservations for 7.30pm worried that the restaurant would be full for that evening. On arrival, it appears that our fears were unfounded as we were brought to the upper floor where only 2 other tables were occupied. If you want a quiet and dark atmosphere, the upper floor works but we would have preferred a table on the lower level (which was full) as it was more bustling, brighter, airier and generally appeared more pleasant.We ordered 2 cocktails (happy hour offer is 2 for $22), a hanger steak and the duck confit, along with a side of fries with truffle aioli dip. The cocktails were average; the alcohol kick was strong but it tastes somewhat ordinary. The food, on the other hand, was decent and prepared well. The hanger steak was sizeable although the vegetables that came along with it were a tad too crunchy and raw. The duck confit was slightly better as it was accompanied by a quinoa base and kale, making it a more balanced meal.Service was very friendly and attentive and our cups were frequently topped up without demand. The staff also made the effort to make conversation, asking how we came to know of the restaurant and if we had difficulties locating the outlet.All in all, this wasn't a cheap meal (around S$95 for two with drinks). It wasn't particularly memorable but it wasn't bad either. Would we come back? Probably but perhaps not a regular dining destination

My fianc√É¬© and I went to the Palmary to celebrate a special occasion, we are glad that we chose Palmary. The service was exceptionally good and the food was delicious.We were hoping to try their ondeh ondeh and rendang fries and were a little sad that it was unavailable.Nevertheless, the chef and staff did a great job in making this celebration special and memorable.Thank you

The place was very cozy and romantic, perfect for a date. We had the lobster linguine, which came with half of a large lobster, and mochi ice cream trio for dessert. The food was filling and tasty. The staff was very good with their service too, frequently checking if we need anything. We'll definitely come back here again, probably to try the lamb shank

The palmary is really a nice place. The staff is really responsive toward our needs and is really cheerful when communicating with us. The food is flavorful and well present.

The atmosphere was cosy and lovely. Volume of music can be a bit lower, but of course, we are seniors. But am sure they will lower the volume if requested.

The owner made great recommendations on the food and drinks, the lighting, decor was impeccable, down to the toilet. It felt so cozy we found it hard to leave the place. I'll definitely revisit! Highly recommend!

A friend & I had a 1-for-1 set dinner at only $50+, so coupled with 2 beverages, each paid only $34 which was a fantastic bargain considering what we had. We started with a lovely mushroom soup that came steaming hot the way I like it. It was rich, aromatic, with generous pieces of mushrooms topped with truffle oil. The barramundi was prettily presented with asparagus spears & other seasonal vegetables. The fish was fresh with a lightly crispy skin. Like with the soup, I shamelessly finished every bit of it! Not a fan of macaroons, I preferred the brownie which was served warm, rich enough but not overpoweringly so, and leaving you wanting more!It was a very busy night when we were there but Ryan, one of the young entrepreneur owners, ensured no table was missed out as he checked to see that everyone was happy with their meals & made time for a social chat at every table. All in, a delectable dining experience, definitely value for money & well worth a visit!

The food was delicious.Service was prompt ( as it should be cos we were the only 2 customers). Only problem we had was that our main course order was wring - we both ordered the same dish & only 1 serving came out - they "thought we were sharing".
5
Had the set meal here. Food was great! We ordered the duck confit and the barramundi. The duck confit's skin was crispy on the outside but the meat remains tender. The fish was fresh and nicely seared. Brownie was good and not too dry. Service staff were friendly! Ambience was cosy. Good for dates or special occasions.

A small eatery in a shophouse with a few F&B outlets along the same row.Waitress was very thorough going through the set menu although we decided not to take it. The ala carte menu is fairly large, a bit fusion.We both took the foie gras which was rather dry. The barramundi was very well done, light and the skin crispy! Vegetables were just cooked.Overall a good experience. Have told a few friends to go check it out

Food was excellent. Had the Hangar steak and Duck Confit for the mains. Ryan was an very entertaining conversationalist, greeting us the minute we walked in and checking in on us during the meal. Cosy and Great interior. Definitely returning to try the other dishes on the menu!

Ryan, the Owner of the Palmary, welcomed us as soon as we stepped into the tastefully done up restaurant. Great decor, great music, and really good vibe - the first impressions as we stepped into the restaurant.Ryan recommended a couple of items from the menu, which we went along with, and we did not regret it. We ordered a Mentaiko Lobster linguine, a pan-fried barramundi, and kong ba paus for sharing. We had some cocktails to go along with the food as well.For the quality of the food, they ought to get a larger crowd, but unfortunately, I think the area is more known for having coffees and brunches, which probably explains why the restaurant is rather empty. They will probably have a hugeeee crowd if they are based in the likes of Telok Ayer, Duxton Hill, etc.I am extremely glad such a good quality restaurant is just based at my backyard, and I will, without any doubt, recommend it to anyone who's in the area looking for dinner

What a place to celebrate your special day with friends and relatives ! I had my birthday dinner there with my close friends to catch up and to have fun in a clean and cool environment. The staff were friendly and the food was great! Sea bass and grill asparagus was flavorful, hang beef was one of the favorites and the soba was indeed a surprising winner. And the prawn paste winglets ... the best I had in Singapore. If you like seafood pasta, must go for the lobster creamy pasta... yummy and very affordable. We ended our meals with a cup of satisfying hot long black coffee. So basic, yet done so well. If you are looking for a new place to have East and West cuisine, this is the spot
