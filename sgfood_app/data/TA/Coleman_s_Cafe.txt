I enjoyed a few meals here. Mainly quick lunch or an afternoon tea. There was not a large choice but the food was good

Offers buffet breakfast, healthy options. alacarte 20% off for inhouse guest. Staff are friendly and helpfull. the Manager Mr. Noordin welcomes you with exceptional service.
3
Nice food at good price, recommended. However, the waiting time for food to be serve is quite Long. Approximately 30 Minute for the 1st main course despite not much people.

Bought fave vouchers online, paid at $70 for two for dinner buffet weekend. Reached at 5.30pm. Staff friendly and usher us in. choice was ok. chili crab must queue by, each time one person to take one pincer. durian pengat is already frozen, hard to scoop, have to wait for the durian pengat to become liquid. This is different from other hotel buffet that I have went to, such as rendezvous and m hotel dinner buffet. Oyster top up fast. Scallop was tasteless, not nice. Overall was a mixed of good and bad. Might consider going again if the promotion is still there. 10minute walk from city hall mrt. just beside funan center

We stayed at the hotel above for 7 day with little children the staff were great helped us with the kids everyday getting them appropriate ucuttlery and making them smile, they were so welcoming. Had a wide range of food and their range of fruit and juice was awesome

Visited this restaurant for breakfast on our first morning in Singapore. We arrived at 10:15am and were aware that breakfast finished at 10.30am. To our disappointment the staff started to take the food away from 10.25am which meant we could not get the full benefit of the buffet. This was in spite of the fact they were keen enough to take the £15pp equivalent from us just minutes before. They could have stopped serving more food and seating people at 10.30am but left the food out but instead they decided to take it away.On the plus side the food itself was of the highest quality although still very overpriced for a breakfast buffet

dinner with family this evening. restaurant is very clean, and the service staff are very friendly ,especially Sakuni and Nethma. very helpful and really can approach to customer and ask if they need help with just a eye contact and smile. great job ladies. only thing to point out : seating was quit crowded. we were siting in between two tables. was quit difficult to get in and out from seat even I am quit skinny.
5
Café spread out over 5 areas seating 220 + Noordin has a great team working to ensure that customers are catered for, tables cleared and cleaned.Staff all friendly and offer assistance when requiredProviding the requisite food choice for all the different nationalities present must be a challenging proposition, however Noordins staff seem to have this well under control.Having no catering background, I can only be amazed at the way this operation flows seemingly flawlesslyCongratulations to Noordin and staff for a well run restaurant, catering to a sometimes difficult cultural mi

We try out their promotion Buffet, booking through FAVE.The booking was impressive & easy. We called this Hotel Café thinking its a weekend & buffet may be largely patronised. The waitress on the other end encouraged that we do a tomorrow's (Sunday) lunch booking instead of tonight's dinner? What an impression, we thought.We settled in being the first few guests, but after another 1+half hours, the place was still quite empty. Most visitors were foreigner's or Hotel Guest...& they were told on the spot "special promotion to S$35 per head", so We guess, need not go through the hassle of booking on-line.The Chilli Crab tonight were small portion & we had a 4-5cm. RUBBER BAND (pulling it to stretch the length of a spoon) swimming in the thick gravy (maybe its just my luck, twice in 2 months in a different restaurant). When approached, the manager wanted to make up to us by changing the bowl of crabs, but we turn it down to stop eating this dish at least for tonight. Luckily we enjoyed the Oysters & the fresh steam prawns & sashimi, The buffet spread was not so complete (to our personal standards)We admit to having much superior food & variety weekly.But for the ambience, to entertain guest this restaurant allows Self Carried Red-wine & have them in-house too selling about S$68 per bottle. or S$12++ per glass

Visited for the first time with the whole extended family for my grandmother's birthday. First impressions: They had a really nice and clean interior with a decent variety of food available. The first thing we tried were their sashimi. They had salmon and tuna available. I asked for 2 portions of each (as shown in the photo) and was quite taken aback at what I was served. The waiter took her time, slowly slicing the fish. The slices were EXTREMELY thin, compared to what other restaurants and buffets serve. (it looks thicker in the photo i uploaded) You couldn't even taste the fish because it was that thin. TIP: If you want thicker slices, ask for more portions. I asked for 10 portions after that and finally got decent sashimi slices. (takes more time to cut 10 portions, so making the slices thicker means she has to cut less slices)Though they were stingy with the sashimi, they were much more generous with their roast beef. 3 slices per plate. For their drinks, they had 2 fruit juices and water, tea, coffee. The orange juice was way too diluted. In the photo I uploaded, you can see the difference between the two. (RIGHT) was the what they had before we asked them to change the juice and (LEFT) was after they replaced the juice. The 'before' juice barely had any orange taste. As the night progressed, the juice gradually went back to it's diluted stage, disappointing. Almost towards the end of our dinner, I noticed some of the waiters standing around the food area chatting amongst themselves, 2 in particular talking over the spread of raw shellfish. Not very hygienic..Overall I would not come back again. Though the food was acceptable, definitely not worth the price paid.Sidenote: When I walked out of the restaurant to use the washrooms in the hotel, there was a very strong cigarette smell at the lift lobby. Wonder why... (air-conditioned areas are non-smoking

Had breakfast here every day as we were staying at the hotel. Good choice of cereals, fresh fruit and hot food. Also had dinner there on a couple of nights. Good menu a d reasonable prices.
3
Many type of food but there wasn't my favorite food. Bacon was too salt. But I really love their tea and fruits. There were sereal and muesli like coco crunch.
1
service slow, food quality average at best, coffee terrible, fruit juice watered. setting drab and very dated
2
Crowded and poor range of food. Don't even try the coffee, plenty of better cafes in walking distance.
2
Buffet spreads are very limited. Some dishes are bland, some were over seasoned. The restaurant is very hot.
4
Bought vouchers from Groupons to celebrate mother's birthday. Price is reasonable and affordable. Call to reserve tables for 20 persons and they arrange very convenient seats for us which is very near to food counter. Food were top up regularly. Staff are friendly especially the manager Noordin
4
I went there with my family about 20 people but need to reserve if not you will not able to get the seats as it is also mother's day. The buffet variety is not as many but still good enough for most people. The oysters and chili crab are really good, plus their durian ice cream really melt in the mouth. The rest of the food are quite okay. As it was mother's day so it is quite crowded. The price I would say i am okay with it

Have been trying to book for CNY's eve dinner. This is the only restaurant available for our family of 9 adults and 2 children. Price is quite reasonable for the spread that served during this festive season. The range is quite catered for Chinese food and also lots of sweeties stuff like candies, chocolates and lollies for the children. Their sashimi especially the salmon taste really good. The staff is very accommodative as well as helpful as we have 2 small children. At the beginning of the buffet the wealth of god walked around to give chocolate coins to the children and around 8plus there are still lion dance show. Some even had some photo taking with the lions. If you have not experienced Chinese New Year and wanted to try. This should be a good restaurant to try it at a reasonably price.

We have visited this cafe-restaurant a few times more than 10 years ago and thereafter stopped coming because it's standard in food and service had deproved significantly then.Time has passed and so we decided to revisit this place after 10 years and it was just last weekend we came by here for lunch. To our surprised, the cafe-restaurant is totally different from our very very last visit! It's now very cosy and a lovely ambience from it's renovations. Now it's brightly lighted with nice and comfortable sofa chairs.The cafe-restaurant is now much better and has improved in its offering and services. First, there is a wide array and spread of food that included local delights, dim sum, japanese, malay and western dishes. There is also a live cooking station where you could order fried carrot cake (white or dark) and roast meat and waffle that is made on the spot after your order with your own toppings.While there are "hits and misses" here in food quality, generally the food here is nice. Even in 5-star restaurants, not every of their dish will appeal to all their diners as taste is quite and different between people.Some of the food we enjoyed included the tom yam soup, roast pork/char siew/chicken, kungpo prawns etc. They have also mee siam and laksa together (usually for most restaurants, its either or and not having both at the same time) but the gravy were bland. If can be enriched and more flavourful, it would be perfect.On the other of the cafe-restaurant, there is a Japanese counter where you could take your sashimi (quite good and fresh) and sushi (ok and average but a bit hard) and next to it, you can have your dim sum and kong-bak pao (braised pork belly stucked in pao) which the latter was quite nice.There was also the black pepper steak (a bit hard perhaps overcooked or cooked too early), turkey, vegetables, fried rice etc.They have a great dessert and fruit corner, with lots of pastries and cakes, bread, ice cream, durian punget, jelly, freshly cut and whole fruits, ice kacang (local version of iced blended over fruits and jelly), longan with almond, chocolate fondue, candies and sweets etc. Well, I think kids or those with a sweet tooth will definitely like it! Hot and cold beverages are also included in the buffet spread which is good as not all restaurants provided cold beverages like orange juices and fruit punches here but only cold iced water.Service was great too. Staff were friendly and very prompt and efficient in clearing the used plates and utensils automatically without the need to signal them despite of the large turnout of crowd during our dinning there.And we felt its quite good "value for money" as one can taste a wide spread of food here all under one roof be it local, asians, japanese, malay etc.In conclusion, we have seen its "before and after" over the years and feel that its has definitely improved from the past and better now though still have room for improvements. We did enjoy our meals here and have plans to revisit it in the near future and we hope it will improve, if not maintain, its food and service quality

There was ample variety from English to Asian and the quality was very good. The breakfast is buffet style but you can order omelettes, various eggs etc all cooked to your requirements. This is not fine dinning but I found the standard very good and is supported by superb staff. Nothing is to much trouble. We dined there in the evening on Asian food very much Chinese based and was good value. The alcohol is stupidly expensive so beware
2
We had salad and Satay. The satay was tasty, however the slad was pretty tired and some of the lettuce was inedible. (Going brown, lettuce leaf ribs are not appealing.)
5
Friendly staff - good food - well managed and efficiently run
Good variety and the staff work quietly to ensure a high standard of cleanlyness

The place is located at the Excelsior Hotel, where we were put up. We visited the cafe for for breakfast only. The breakfast (buffet) was SIMPLY awesome.
2
I am disappointed to share that this is the worst breakfast buffet I had in a Hotel setting!Firstly, crowded to the point that the guests (me included) have to sit at the impromto tabes outside the ballroom lobby. Too many mainland Chinese tourists. The Buffet line was quite messed up. The worst butter crossiants that i had - it was overnight stale and hard as cement. The eggs station was the redeeming station so far. The nasi lemak station was commendable. Sausages was tastelss but the baked beans were quite nice. Porridge was acceptable. Other hot dishes, did not try much.If you are looking for a cheer me up breakfast buffet, this is NOT the buffet to go to

We celebrated my nephew's 21st birthday here with 70 plus guests. There is a wide variety of food displayed, from Japanese, western to Asian. It was a buffet for dinner.Even my elderly parents enjoyed the chicken soup, roasted chicken and mussels. My Favourite was the mushroom soup, roast beef and sashimi. The service was good especially when it was time to cut the swenson's ice cream cake, the staff were very helpful. Overall, I would recommend it to family and friends to celebrate any occasion here
4
Try it once and feel acceptable. The food choice was various in term of cuisine and dishes. The juice is good too. My two favourite dishes are bread with maple syrup and the baked bean. This place opens from 7:30AM and is very suitable for travelers who want to refill their energy earlier for a long travelling day
5
We had breakfast buffets and an international dinner buffet here at Coleman's Cafe while we were guests at Peninsula Excelsior. The buffets were fantastic plenty of options and the food quality was clean and fresh. The staff were polite and helpful. The dinner was fantastic fresh prawns mussels with plenty of options. They even had asian roast meats like BBQ pork roast chicken and Roast pork on offer. They have so many options for food they had to place the dessert and drinks table on another side of the restaurant. Overall this place does fantastic meals we would return again
5
My wife and I had two evening meals and five breakfasts here. They were all very enjoyable and good value for money, especially with the buy one get one free deals with the Tiger beer and house wine. The catered excellently with gluten free options. Very friendly staff
5
Morning buffet breakfast here is heaven. The EGG Chef is very friendly and will do anything you want done on your breakfast eggs (poached, boiled, sunnyside, omelet, etc ). Their bacon is really crispy and everything you need from the bakery shop is available. Thumbs up for this plac

We had two breakfasts and on lunch at the restaurant. Once we had broken the ice with the staff they were very helpful in describing dishes and looking after us. Range of food is a pretty standard mix of Western and Asia dishes. Breakfast had a good range of food for most visitors. I enjoy a lovely baked salmon dish for lunch, which I would recommend to others.All in all a pleasant place to eat. Staff make it a bit special for us
5
Coleman's cafe is really good. that has lot of food varieties. And the service times are really convenient.
4
I came to have a dessert during dinner time. The lemon cheese cake and latte are good and the staffs are very friendly.
2
Food is ordinary and expensive for what you get. Cleanliness was an issue when I visited, with food scraps left on the floor from breakfast. Better options close by
5
Within the Peninsula Hotel complex level 5, great margaritas and singapore sling, terrific service and friendly staff
2
After travelling through European hotels, the dining area for breakfast in this hotel is poor in comparison. The quality of food is poor and they seem to want to cater for the mass chineese visitors. If you are European origin/Australian it is unsatisfactory.
5
This place is newly renovated. I, like the local dishes, like nasi lemak, Very generous with the ingredients and the price is considered cheap.
5
The review title says it all! This was my second stay here in two years and I enjoyed it just as much the second time around. The buffet breakfast is quite varied and even the coffee is great --sometimes it's hard to find good coffee at a hotel buffet
4
Having looked around the area out of the hotel,it became apparent that most of the eating establishments price points were all around the same. After a day in the heat of Singapore we didn't really want to tramp around again so we decided to look at the cafe within the hotel. The name cafe is probably a bit misleading as it is better than a cafe but not quite a restaurant,but clean and looked adequate for our needs, not too expensive by Singapore standards anyway.The place was almost empty which meant that there was no atmosphere, but this also meant we did not have to queue, or book in advance, and it didnt really bother us as all we wanted was something to eat(i would imagine most people who arrive in Singapore from the Uk are tired on the first night).We were a little bit worried about the quality of the food but being within the hotel we guessed it should be of a certain standard.There was a reasonable choice of Asian and Western food and if you were resident at the hotel you get 20% off food and drink but NOT off the 3 course set menu . We went for the set menu of Ceaser Salad,Salmon with rice and Pannacotta. The service was friendly, Quick and efficient and the food was very good
5
Using Coupons, we decided to try the Western buffet and it didn't disappoint. Varied selection of seafood starters and soup. Main meal buffet was a varied selection of Tempura, Beef stew, Roast Lamb, baked potato, Curries, Asian cuisine and lots of other items. Great varied choices. Desserts were ice cream, and an iced concoction if you know how to work the machine. Cheese board if you have any room left. Free flow of fresh juices, tea and coffee, this was certainly a great deal for the price. I did say above that it isn't the best meal I've had in a restaurant (I've been to a lot of restaurants worldwide) but for the price, the quality of the food is faultless and certainly worth a visit. I would return to this restaurant. Staff were all friendly and very helpful. Used plates were quickly removed with fresh cutlery provided each time.Great Brunch! (if you find the review helpful, please acknowledge.

Singapore breakfasts are legendary, more variety of food that ypu can eat andcatering to the tastes of all nationalities. Plenty to eat, but I must admitit sounds and looks like a noisy school canteen as the hordes descend upon it all. I think next time I'll find quiet cafÃ© next door
4
~It can be a bit noisy but there are several outdoor settings as well. If it isn't too humid, give them a try.
5
Terrific breakfast... plenty of range of assorted dishes, must try the Lotus Pao, really good. Also great for Dinner if you don't want to go out and explore.
4
Good Service and great coffee and cake at a decent price. We went there three times and were welcomed back every time with a smile and good service.
4
Only ate here for breakfast, food was good and plenty of choice
Only downside was the area is very busy and not a lot of tables. Food was kept topped up and tables cleared quickly.
4
We only used this restaurant for breakfast which was adequate, if a little different, and not particularly geared to western tastes. However the buffet was wholesome and sufficient for our needs, and it was interesting to try out some different dishes.
2
The buffet is definitely not attuned to Western tastes.
If you are happy to pay over the odds for a-la carte then make a booking.
3
The food was good and fresh but less variety than expected. Bit of a wait for seating at times. Staff was attentive. Overall, not bad.
3
Dinner here is not really a cool thing to do. The question is why to open a restaurant in the night if there is zero attention to customers. This is why probably the place is ok (?) during the breakfast and zero after 20pm. Anyhow i had a angus steak it was good and a corn oiled soup that was not ok, this is why of my ranking. Next time order food in the room at list you can look tv and the SG panorama!! Take care guy

We went for the lunch buffet and we were not disappointed for the price we paid using deal coupons. Good value all in all.First of all, the variety is slightly limited, but I found it sufficient as the quality is really quite good.The seafood was fresh and tasty. The prawns deserved a mention of its own for its amazing freshness. The sashimi didn't look so good, but tasted fresh and had a firm bite.The roast beef was flavorful and cooked to perfection.The chicken curry was very good, rich and fragrant. The potatoes were gorgeous in this curry.The cooked dishes were mostly excellent, I did not try all of them so I'm not qualified to say all of the dishes were good. The prawn noodle was tasty, the chap chye had a deep flavor, horfun was ok. Desserts wise, while there was not a huge selection, most were executed to an above average standard, with the durian pengat stealing the show. The kuehs were good. The mushroom soup was good, tasted like they made it from scratch. This may seem like a given but most buffets and restaurants do a very bad mushroom soup.The service was fast and attentive. Areas for improvement if I were to come without a coupon and still find it good value: slightly more variety on the seafood selection, a cooked noodle station with a chef, improved desserts variety with better cakes. Food quality wise it's pretty good right now so no complaints there

Went to Coleman's Cafe for their buffet dinner with a friend of mine and her family as we saw their 1-for-1 promotion advertisement on the newspaper earlier on.The restaurant was relatively empty; only five to six tables were occupied within my vicinity. The seafood selection was limited without much variety and not fresh, and the placement of the food was rather confusing. There would be food in a corner which might be missed out by certain people not paying close attention. The service was fine, the waiters were prompt in clearing plates and I had no problems with the overall service as to speak. However, the real problem lies with the quality of the food presented in the buffet. I had only consumed the seafood, the mushroom soup (which was delicious, by the way), the Chinese cooked food (a little bit of everything) and the ice cream, but this was sufficient to warrant a day's worth of food poisoning and diarrhea ten hours later at 4 in the morning. This would not be a problem had I not confirmed with my friend and her family that 4 out of 6 of us were down with food poisoning.This is really disappointing and enough to warrant our absence from Coleman's for some time. Hope the hotel and food and beverage department can take this review constructively and improve on their back of house hygiene and etc
