very fast service, friendly staff, great food, portion was a little smaller than usual (probably coz of cny), the cny/new menu didn't have some of the items on the normal menu which was abit disappointing, nice ambience, overall a great experience
5
Service was good, food was delicious and had very unique presentation, enjoyed the entire dining experience!
3
food is not suitable who likes strong flavor due to low salt/sugar and is pricey. environment and service is ok.
5
Lokkee created a niche by ensuring that its food appearance is appealing to its consumers. Besides the looks, the taste is of a high standard as well. The Mermaid (limited quantity every day) is a must haveh
5
The food is above average but the service by those aunties is excellent. Very friendly and nice. Make the whole meal session very enjoyable.
4
Had the cny set meal 5. The ala-carte dishes looks more exciting than the set meal. Not much plating done up for the set meal compared to the ala-carte dishes. Food taste better than expected. FYI, no wine by the glass served.
4
If you like modern Chinese (actually, to be accurate, mod-Chinese or American-Chinese, look no further. Creative interpretations, although if you prefer traditional Chinese food, then this place isn't the right spot for you. Prices are in the slightly higher range.
5
Excellent choice for showing off Chinese Food with Gimmick, especially guest from oversea. unfortunately, the color changing tea are not available.
4
The first aspect that struck me was the friendliness of the service crew. They do not shy away from telling you the promotions and tell you ways to make full use of it. The food has always been good though the wait was a little long as it might have been due to the holiday season
4
Enjoyed everything about Lokkee - the decor, service and food. To start the night off we had a couple of cocktails, a tad sweet but still drank every drop. We were quite tickled by the wet tissues packaging. We ordered sweet and sour pork, fire cracker chicken and barramundi. Ended our meal with fried banana egg rolls. No complaints at all.
4
Creative presentation for some of the dishes, especially the pineapple beef. Food portion is not especially large, thus, group of 4-6 would be just nice.
3
The concept is quite interesting. Ordered the flaming beef dish and it was spectacular. The chow mian was not bad at all. The pork belly bun was beautiful. Will definitely go next time.
5
Very good food and ambience. There is also a secret room if you know the code to enter. Mushu pork and garlic shrimp noodles are a must try
4
Loved the novel presentation of some of the dishes we had! Their flaming pineapple beef cubes and grilled fish deserve a special mention. Be sure to make a reservation for dinner - the restaurant is crowded even on weekday nights!
5
Truly enjoyed the food and the service provided by the staffs, their servings are small but for the food quality it is good.
4
Lokkee is a pretty interesting Chinese restaurant to dine at. It retains certain important aspects of Chinese food (in this case Sichuan cuisine, one of the 8 major cuisine in Chinese culinary world) while introducing some interesting culinary play-up and tricks. It sure makes the whole dining experience interesting and the slight twist to traditional dishes makes it much more enjoyable
4
Tried Lokkee last week to celebrate a friend's birthday. This is our first time and we are very impressed with the food quality and the services rendered; particularly the way the birthday cake is served. It was served after our meal without "warning", not only there is birthday song, the cake is also placed on on dry ice when served. This makes it very interesting and exciting. It is really a "WOW" experience for all of us
5
Service staff were very attentive and food was delicious. We enjoyed The Mermaid - a dish recommended by their staff and we were informed about the promotion price. The staff also helped to take photos for us and were fast in clearing and presenting the dishes.
4
Had a good dinner here with my Husband and 2yo Daughter. Ordered the fried rice with crab meat, mushroom chop suey, egg drop soup and 8 treasure tea. Total cost is around S$60. Service is pretty good. Food came relatively fast. And we clean the dishes! Am already thinking of bring some of my friends from overseas here to eat. Itâ€™s not a typical traditional Chinese restaurant though so do note when you bring older more traditional folks here.
3
We ordered the awesome flaming pineapple beef, firecracker chicken, ginseng chicken soup, chilli crab cakes, and Bakkwa bacon salad. While the experience of pineapples on fire, or angling barbecued meat on suspended racks was novel, the food itself was forgettable. The premium paid for the novelty included a discount in the quality of the ingredients, even by the overpriced standards of Chinese restaurant dining in Singapore. Good for a one-time visit
4
Nice and interesting menu but a little too expensive for the kind of food served. Hard to go if it was only 2 pax
5
The food was good and the staffs were attentive. Overall very good experience at Lokkee, will definitely return again!
4
food is yummy. presentation is wow.... and wet tissue is amazing. price is a bit expensive. Sure that i will visit again.
5
Wonderful service and food options! I will come back again.
I would like to try the mermaid dish the next time i return! :)
4
third time here, and love their dishes. gimmicky but with quality.
only wish the cracker chicken was spicier..
5
The service crews were so alert and happy to attend to help u. The food is great and valuable for money.
3
Service are good as the waitress seems to be assigned to only a few table. The presentation of the food is served differently such as fire on the pineapple cast and inside the pineapple cast is chicken. The food taste ok only and price are more costly. But it is the ambience of the place, presentation of the food that create novelty. Good experience. Need reservation for table.
5
You must know what's best when kids can ooze in soup and slurp the noodle by themselves without you telling them and forcing them to dine. My wife even told me that the food here is not just delicious and kids loved it but it's fun and innovative on how Chinese food can be served differed from the traditional ones. She is sure that we will return for sure !
4
Was expecting some spicy Sze Chuan food but turned out to be rather unique asian-fusion cuisine. Ordered the stir-fried kale, flaming pineapple beef, "fish" fries and egg floss crispy oyster. All the dishes were good but the beef was a standout due to the tenderness. Surprisingly and unexpectedly better than expected here
5
We ordered the dishes from both secret menu and normal menu. 5 of us were seated at the chamber area. The food is very good... the pork belly and maw and bak kwa appertiser are good. The XO fried rice is good too ! The food is expensive though.
5
Back here again; this time round I brought my bf’s parents and they loved it too!
We tried new dishes like their Irish Duck which was really tender~
5
It was a farewell party for a colleague and we enjoyed the food very much. Wish the portions could be bigger
4
I had an enjoyable lunch with family and friend. Menu are unique and tasty. Prices are a bit on the high side though.
4
Different experience with great food and ambience. Value for money and worth the trip there to dine.
4
Food is tasty and nicely plated. The service is excellent too! Definitely will be back for more. If you like hot & spicy dishes, you must try their Sichuan Mala Grilled Fish and Firecracker Chicken Nest. The rest of the dishes are v good too.
4
The foods are nice, except the prices a bit too high, so only can have it once in while. I wish I can have it more often is the price can be a bit lower, as I really enjoy the foods.
4
Great ambiance, awesome food, good service. Definitely will be back again soon! Do check out the secret chamber •.<
5
Food were excellent. must order 1) Kungbao chicken 2) salted egg fish skin and most of their specialty were awesome. Service was excellent. Table could be a bigger as 6 person squeeze 4 table.
4
Salted Egg Fish Skin and Firecracker Chicken Nest were good! The design of how the egg yolk is actually mango puree was something interesting!
5
We enjoyed the dinner at Lokkee for celebrating my best friend birthday. It is almost a like private room where we had two big tables side by side. The food were delicious and very tasty as well as nicely served. We were surprised with the Chow Mein that served like a take away style with special fork+chopsticks. The staff is also attentive throughout the dinner including serving the tea and provide small plates for the birthday cake.
5
The food, wine, service and atmosphere is great. It's the next "it" location for the next few months i would say.
4
A tad pricey, but a great experience nevertheless. Chicken crackers were on point. Spicy/mala fans will love the place.
4
sumptuous yummy contemporary chinese-western fusion food. my favourite chinese restaurant in singapore!
3
The food is mediocre and overpriced. Will not go to the restaurant again. The service is excellent though.
4
Plus points for the creativity of Lokkee dishes! Food tastes delicious as well. But the only thing is the price is a bit too high and the portion is too small for a big group of us. Maybe worth a try but not frequent visits.
5
The food was amazing, the service was good but the only gripe is that they do not have enough private dining areas for large groups. Party of 12 were seated at an awkwardly long table.
4
Recommended to take the Mermaid. It is Barrumundi in fish & college stock. Basically can be treated as a whole meal on its own. It has bean curd, preserved vegetable & cabbage. 2nd top up of soup was rather salty . Their Mongolian beef with onions was nice too. Love the olive rice better than those in Thai restaurant. They added some rice crackers which definitely gave some crunch to it. Not oily at Al!
4
Nice food nice environment. The portion is just more than enough n presentation is fantastic. Only upset is the basic, rice is terrible. Hard and lack moisture, not warm. Cost 1.50 for a bowl.And not the stated country of origin. One of the worse crystal rice. Will not order plain rice in future
4
This is my 2nd time to this restaurant... the food is good. My father who is usually picky about his food has only praises for the dishes we ordered. The Flaming Pineapple, Bacon Salad. XO Crab fried rice are just some of the yummy food that we've tried
4
You know you've walked into a Chinese-american joint when you see mushu pork on the menu. But trust the Tung Luk group to turn the cuisine on its head and make it upmarket. The set lunch I had, a mushu pork and a bowl of mushroom broth, were both tasty. The pork had a good mix of salty, sweet and sour and I like the mushrooms stir fried in with the pork. The broth was light but also had a richness of flavour. Very impressed with the quality for a $12 set lunch. As in any chinese-american dining experience, the meal ended with a fortune cookie. And oh, look out for the wet wipes.....
4
While the food appears gimmicky, it was surprisingly good. Especially the fish in collagen broth and the fried chicken with mango puree.
4
After trying out in the first year of opening it is good to find out that the food standards have not dropped and was properly maintained. Service was even better than previous visit.
3
Seat down if never ask for drinks or order food, no one will walk to us. Slow and lousy service...........………
5
We went to the The Dragon Chambers which did not allow reservations but we loved it totally! Was there for our monthsary dinner~
3
Very tasty appetizer crab cakes, and salted egg yolk fish skin. Fish was a huge portion & not spicy. Flaming pineapple beef was average though it was quite a good presentations.
4
Food was good. Beef fried rice is a must order. Pineapple beef was hearty and the Szechuan popcorn chicken is spicy, which is great! Cocktails can be stronger. Great place to celebrate birthdays as the staff will enthusiastically celebrate with the birthday star.
1
Food was not hot - we ordered beef with pineapple n lobster with lettuce was dinner extremely disappointing
4
We went there in a group of 10 to celebrate friend's birthday. The room reserve to us is spacious enough for us and the staffs are very friendly and patiently suggest to us what dish to eat.The foods are delicious and special. Personally i like the London Duck
5
Went to Lokkee with my family. Everyone love it. The waiters always on a lookout for your needs; refilling the soups and water. It is also easy to get their attention when you need something. The waiters are also knowledable about the dishes and make recommendations too
3
Food quality was slightly above average. Nothing really stood when it came to quality and taste of the food. The presentation was excellent though. If high quality food and taste is what you are after, I would recommend you try one of Tung Lokâ€™s other brands.
5
Great visit with friends. Slightly crowded during Friday as its the weekends. Food was affordable too
4
It's a farewell dinner for a friend going back to USA for good.
He had enjoyed the food especially the fish dish as he is picky on seafood.
Thanks for the good quality food & service.
5
Prompt service, great presentation, most of all the dishes we order were delicious
Definitely will visit soon again!
5
We went there with family and friends after our ROM. The service was excellent. The dishes are very creative. However the portion was a bit small.
5
Back for a few times already. Food is good. And unique. Service is also good. Must try dishes are the fire cracker chicken, bacon salad, mermaid.
Remember to ask for the dragon chamber if you want to walk in. They have a secret dish.
3
Food was pretty good, but atmosphere and rest was pretty average. It would do for a casual dinner sort of thing
4
Very unique offering of modern Chinese cuisine, with a wide variety of menu selection. Some food to cater to vegetarians, which is great! Love the secret menu!!!
Desserts weren't as great as described in menu though.
Overall, still a wonderful dining experience!
5
The staff service is great. Ordered four dishes 1) Awesome flaming pineapple beef 2)5 spice crispy pork belly 3) Bakkwa Bacon Salad 4) The Mermaid. Ending the dinner with mantou ice cream. The food are worth the price. Will be back for other dishes.
4
A cardboard menu shows all the dishes & desserts is so convenience. The wet tissues in square wrap so unique! Sour spicy soup is tasty, popular pork slices & garlic noodles definitely is must order!!
4
First things that caught our attention was the "condom-like" wet tissue. 3 of us order 5 of their signature dishes such as the fire cracker chicken nest, minced lobster lettuce wrap, egg drop soup, spicy pork belly & shrimp garlic noodle. Overall food was ok. Favourite dishes still the chicken nest & spicy pork belly
5
Good and nice ambience of the restaurant. Delicious food and friendly staffs. Would surely go there again.
5
Second time to lokkee and we tried the mermaid which is a limited quantity dish. The food is good but the price is rather steep for its serving portions. Be prepared to spend a bomb
3
Lokkee is great. Food is delicious.
Actually no need to use Chope to book a reservation. Call direct and check for promotional discount. Better value.
4
We had some really great dishes at Lokkee and the service was impeccable, but it would be good if it was less pricey!
5
Had a very good experience with food and ambience down at Dragon Chamber at Lokkee. Food was fantastic and very special. Not the usual Chinese food but with special sauce and deco. Worth a visit.
5
LOOOVE this place, perfect for group dinners especially with people from out of town. The Chinese food with a twist is brilliant and delicious!
5
Food was good as usual. Portion was quite big. Celebrated my partner's birthday at this venue. Will be back again.
4
Great service. The spicy chicken and flaming pineapple beef were delicious, with a certain hint of theatrics to boot.
Would recommend a visit, however not too much return value as the dishes are not particularly outstanding relative to price point.
4
Heard much rave about Lok Kee, hence made a reservation to celebrate my mum's birthday. I would say quality of food is definitely of standard. The presentation, especially is pretty impressive. Including the way they presented our birthday cake. Thumbs up for the extra mile!Service staffs are passionate and very friendly, definitely wouldn't expect any less in service delivery given the price tag to the dishes. Overall, a good experience and will return to try other dishes too
5
If I can only commend on 1 thing, it'll has to be the service. It's as if I'm friend with the service crew & they're there for my family. We we're so well taken care of for the short 90min dinner that the food was well received by all 12 members at the table. Of course, the food is splendid with the little twist of dishes that we were supposedly familiar with. From my parents to my little nephews, the dinner was awesome. The crew also scored Brownie points with the dry ice presentation for our birthday cake. Would certainly visit Lokkee again! Will recommend too!!
4
This is a restaurant with positive surprises. Quite a number of interesting attractions. Worth a try!
4
good chinese food though its slightly pricy. need to order the right food. the duck is quite good! must order
5
Fantastic food with great customer service :) Especially love the secret chamber at Lokkee! Will be back!
4
Although service was a little slow, the food was decent, it wasn't just classic dishes but more of a twist to chinese food. The maps tofu was probably one of my favourite dish!
4
One of a kind food and presentation. Gives a twist to the usual Chinese quisine. Good service and friendly staff.
4
Went here for dinner to celebrate my friend birthday at the Dragon Chamber. Love the atmosphere and food was great. Overall very memorable experience
4
We decided to try out the Dragon Chamber which is located within Lokkee after reading some reviews online. This hidden dining area is cozy and intimate for small groups and food menu is made interesting with a secret menu.
4
As usual , anything by TungLok is a good thing I love the food , the service and the ambience. I like how the mermaid and the ma la fish was prepared . Tasteful and delicious The only thing I felt was lacking is that the pineapple beef is lacking in quantity
3
I've been to Lokkee a number of times, the last two with family and friends. All were unanimous that the food was good! That's why I've been there a few times though the service had always been too pushy for my liking; the servers were constantly trying to get you to order their most expensive dishes. (That accounts for the average rating.)You don't have to hand over all your cash to have a great meal here. Just be firm about what you want to eat. I recommend the Awesome Flaming Pineapple Beef but don't wait too long to open up the pineapple. The Firecracker Chicken Nest is tasty & interesting but beware of the chilli; it's a firecracker! We also enjoyed the 5 Spice Crispy Pork Belly & Cereal Egg Floss Oysters
4
The food is quite good. I would think it is slightly above average. There is novelty in the food and the dishes that it is being made. However I won't say it is so good that you will have to visit no matter what. Overall it is good for one time try
4
Food is presented in a very special manner and the dragon chamber made the visit more exciting than usual
5
Everything here is a little tongue in cheek- the decorations, the items on the menu, even the towelettes! The food is reliably good though, as befitting a Tung Lok restaurant. Can't wait to return!
5
Great food and nice environment! Ordered the fried noodles and prawns, really well cooked and the service staff are polite and nice as well. Overall great experience.
4
The dishes served were creative but the servings served were rather not filling to the tummy. Nonetheless, customer service was rather good.
4
Service staff was attentive. Food was nice. If you hv 10 pax, should ask for their private area. I didn't request and was seated at the table nearest to kitchen. Quite noisy.
5
A local gem with predominantly local crowd - a great sign. Enjoyed the dishes and beer/cocktail. Crispy fish skin freshly prepared taste so much better! Goes well with the cocktail and beer. Flaming pineapple beef was tender, sweet and tangy. The grilled barramundi with Dancing Crab sauce was also very refined. Fish was grilled just right. The dancing crab sauce blends well.We will be back to see how Lokkee has innovated on other Chinese specialties
4
Enjoyed the dishes:1. Crispy Pork Belly - a good mixed of lean and fat. Complemented with a great sauce.2. Mapo Tofu - prepared in a texturised curd and generously served with minced pork.3. Firecracker Fried Chicken - the diced chicken is not oily and the punch is provided by the dried chilli
4
We decided to have dinner to celebrate 2 birthdays and venue was selected very last minute. We had the crispy salted egg yolk fish skin which was light, crispy & tasty - for me, it was the best food for the night. The seafood noodle was alright as was the baby kailan. I didn't try the fried rice but the banana roll/fritters was a good way to end the dinner. 2 other tables had birthday cakes brought over while happy birthday played loudly so I was sorry I didn't request for the same for my friends. Overall a pleasant time with friends
4
This first thing that caught my eyes was the condom lookalike wet towelette that was placed on my plate. I was thinking to myself, what a great idea this was to capture a diner's attention and to market itself. In this day and age, thinking out of the box and to be disruptive is how a business can turn overnight success. But if their food sucks, these gimmicks would not keep it going for long. Then my train of thoughts was interrupted by the first dish served. I was blown away by the presentation. Dry ice! Such elaboration! And what was that? Color changing tea. Not bad, not bad at all.And I soon fell love with the bakkwa bacon salad. Bacon was thick, juicy and so worth the calories. I was really beginning to like this restaurant. Next up. The firecracker chicken with the yolk looking mango pudding was so innovative. Not to mention that the dish was absolutely delicious! The fried rice was good even for someone like me who doesn't enjoy eating rice.I am so going to tell my friends and colleagues about this fabulous place. It makes lunch fun and interesting
4
The presentation is rather gimmicky, right from the condom looking wet tower to the fortune cookies (No decent Chinese resturant would offer it, unless you are located in a China Town!) They have two dinning halls, the 'normal' is Lokkee, and the 'special' is inside 'Dragon Chamber' enter from a secret door, like the Chinese gangster kind of drama, and it serve a premire menu. Most of the dishes are creatively presented on dry-ice or flambe, rather dramatic in the dark setting. Portion size is good for 6-pax. About S$50+ per head. If you like novelty, this is the place
5
We enjoyed our lunch at Lokkee. Great to see warm, smiling and courteous restaurant staff. Bell, one of the restaurant supervisor was outstanding in taking care of the guests.
The food was refreshingly exotic and well presented. Enjoyed it thoroughly.
Highly recommended.
4
Did the booking weeks in advance. Arrived on the day itself, mention if able to request for round table. But only told min of 8 pax and above and also must have min spending to be entitled the round table.
5
Went there to celebrate my Boyfriend's birthday. They do not have birthday cake, only have dessert without candles. Food's price is slightly at the high range. But overall, love the environment and the secret chamber feeling.
4
Food was up to expectation and ambience was great for friends gathering. Will definitely revisit this restaurant again in the near future.
4
Part of Tung Lok group but a more affordable dining option. The food was ok for the price. Comfortable and ok ambience.
4
It was our second time to Lokkee and this time to celebrate my MIL's birthday. The overall experience was good, food was definitely yummy for sure. Good overall experience and we will be back.
5
The food was very nice and Creative..service is very attentive..especially the bakkwa bacon salad is must to try..
5
The best part of coming here is the constant surprise in the food. For example, the Fire cracker chicken that come a with what looks like egg yoke but is actually sweet mango purÃ©e to cool down the spice. Yet, taste is good too. My favourite is the XO sauce crab meat fried rice
3
Our 1st visit. We ordered the firecracker chicken which was really good and highly recommended. The duck in springroll was so-so only. Beef fried rice is good. Stirfried kailan with garlic was average.What I really really like are the quirky references to Star Wars like C3P0 & R2D2 in a Chinese painting, a family portrait of a Chinese Princess Leia & Han Solo et
5
Other than the crazy loud music at times, the food here was creative, delicious, and great for sharing. Maybe the pineapple beef was a bit of a fire show, but the pineapples still tasted tangy and were juicy. Some veg options (tell staff if you eat egg). One of the staff told us at 655pm about happy hour which ends at 7pm - for affordable alcohol and fish skin snacks! Generally an enjoyable experience, if only the music was softer! Worth trying the olive rice, pineapple beef, kung pao chicken and Irish duck.
4
Creative Chinese dishes in a very ang moh style. A bit pricey though. Excellent service as our tea was constantly being refilled.
5
The food and service received were excellent. Staff attentive and good quality dishes. I recommend a visit to this restaurant.
5
Gastronomia feast for both the eye and the stomach. Very instagram worthy. Food is exquisite. Fresh ingredient professional cooking standard
5
Loved t he American-Chinese style of cuisine and the food was indeed wonderfully and skilfully cooked by the chef.
1
For the price, the food is not worth it. But good for trying to innovate . If the price is adjusted or better food quality , I might consider.
3
Serving is rather small for the price charged.ambience is quite nice. Overall, the menu is quite costly.
5
Love the restaurant decoration, especially naughty tissue pack in resemblance of condom. Bold and interesting. Server is friendly and food was creative and delicious.
5
The food in lokkee never disappoint my family members and friends...unique ambience, decor, friendly staff, innovative dishes and Creative display!!
4
Went into the dragon's chamber, which was a pleasant surprise. Although the room was a bit dark, the experience was very unique. Ordered sesame noodles off the secret menu, as well as the flaming pineapple beef.Both dishes were pretty good, though very overpriced. Grab a coupon from Chope to get some discount
4
I arranged to celebrate two family members' birthdays at The Dragon Chamber which has its secret entrance in Lokkee. I was sure we would have a good time. And the restaurant did not disappoint. Great ambience, food and service helped everyone enjoyed a swell time. The crocodile paw, ginseng soup, bakwa bacon salad, wagyu truffle hor fun will be our must orders every time we visit
1
I don't usually write an unbalanced review, but the service from the manager/supervisor had completely ruined my night, so I shall not mention about anything other than the horrendous service I got.
4
Interesting presentation of food!.My parents were constantly impressed and amused with the food, but in a good way. Would definitely come back here again to try their interesting menu of cocktails!
5
The service was good and the staff are very attentive. The food presentation was unique and the food is very nice. It definitely value for money. I will certainly go back to the restaurant again.
4
Exciting and innovative fusion food. The interesting displays ensures that you will never run out of topics at the dinner table.
5
The food is nice. The embiance is so comfortable and the waitresses is providing us a very friendly services.
5
A cool and vibrant restaurant with quality food and great service!
Was pleasantly surprised by the recent new wing - Dragon chamber and its secret menu. The beef hor fun was very memorable!
3
Made a last min reservation as I was at a loss where to dine near dhoby ghaut which is more local in flavor for foreign guests as it's By local tunglok group. Perhaps the lady who answered the call was busy with a multitude of things, she seemed to be talking to me and a few other people. Anyway after some negotiation, I managed to make a reservation. 3 egg veg (apparently it's curly kale not just kailan) $18, xo crab fried rice $20, braised pork bun 2 pieces only $16, oyster cereal $26 (was advised to buy the membership card at $21.40 to get this dish at discount $22), happy hour beers $5/each x3, was given a free fried fish skin. Ordered a few dishes only (1 rice, 1 veg, 1 dish & 1 appetizer with 3 drinks) and was shocked that the bill was over $100 for 2 plus tax. Price aside, the portions aren't so reasonable. Fried rice was for 2-3 pax but a regular man can easily eat all by himself. For this price, portions definitely can be bigger. The taste is pretty good. Wouldn't expect less for tunglok group right? But for this food this taste, plenty other places sell. The service, for this price, should be much better. It's not really casual dining. The atmosphere is a mix of whimsy and modern Chinese. The "condom" style wet tissue packaging was interesting for guests. Would I be back again? Hmm... undecided. I might. But hesitant.
5
With a last minute reservation through Chope for a Friday night, I was pleasantly surprised to be given a private room for my family dinner. The recommended food were very tasty and we enjoyed the ambience. We were amazed that 4 birthday celebrations took place that night but different birthday songs were played for the birthday celebrants, making them feel special, I'm sure because I know I would
4
This is a restaurant under Tung Lok. The food is here creative. The presentation was capturing. I would think this is a good place to bring both client and family and friends to.Overall service and quality is good. We ordered the spicky chicken (辣子鸡), mapo tufu and XO sauce fried rice
4
The menu caters for large groups. And it serves some visually compelling dishes that ensures the modern diners have plenty to share with their friends, from the moment they discover what is lying on their plate (a wet napkin package designed to look like a condom bag) to dishes that convert the whole table into a fairytale land with dry ice effect. It's exciting. Ask about the Dragon Chamber, which is a new restaurant next door, and you'll be ushered through a secret passage for more culinary and sensory surprises
4
Food is good in tast , potion is big enough for 4 people to share also, just the price is slightly above average
5
All the food here tastes great but I highly recommend the showstoppers - the flaming pineapple and the dry ice pork. :)
4
Food - not bad, especially the signature la Zi Ji
Service - slow, often neglected
Environment - not too bad
4
went there during early lunch time. not many customers inside. crispy pork belly the sauce too less. but the skin is very nice and not very salty like some outside. i like it
5
Mother day lunch. Perfect, we enjoyed the service and food. Was alittle disappointed with the mapo tofu , the rest are above expectations! Smiley staffs with good attitude.
4
My family patronized on a Saturday. The staffs were very helpful and attentive. Food was delicious, at least my family enjoyed it very much. The presentation of food was a great conversation starter. Will definitely return to this restaurant again
4
Food are nice and unique. Love the oyster omelette and Firecracker Chicken Nest. Price reasonable. Will visit again
5
The Firecracker Chicken at Lokkee is one of my favourite dishes! Worth a trip just for that. Recommended.
4
The F&B Team are attentive even though the restaurant was busy with diners and they serve with smile. I love their few significant dishes and the food is nice. Hope to be surprise with more creative presentation next time! PS: Check out their packaging for the wet tissu
4
This is my third time going to this restaurant. It is under the Tunglok Group. They serve Chinese food with a bit of a western twist, which is interesting. Service is impeccable everytime I'm there. But it is slightly pricey for the portion. We particularly liked the Mala Grilled Fish and Mapo Tofu. The Flaming Pineapple Curry was also very entertaining
4
Ordered the signature dishes, chicken nest, Grill fish with tomato, pork belly, XO fried rice. Chicken is so so, fish and fried rice is good. Pork belly has very good presentation and the salad is very nice. Overall service is excellent!
4
The food was great and tasty . Can get a little spicy for the chicken though. Overall, it is only worth it if there is a discount.
5
Good service and reasonable price for some dishes. Should make the place bigger. Will come back again!
4
A different dining experience at Lok Kee which is part of Tung Lok group
The menu is special and unique.
3
Me and my family's 1st and last visit. The food are overpriced and overrated. Nothing fantastic just that the display is nice.
4
Good food , great atmosphere. very interesting concept of food being served and displayed. we were all surprised. and the food was served fast as well.
4
First time there, for my birthday dinner with a friend. Found out that many people celebrate birthday there as they can play the birthday song while they serve your cake (bought elsewhere). It's a great place for big group.
4
Interesting dishes and presentations. Worth a try. Get more people there to order many different varities of food.
4
This place has quality food. Service staff were friendly and helpful too. The price is a bit on the high side though.
3
We were there for a birthday celebration and brought our own birthday buns, the staff was kind enough to serve the buns in a nice presentation to us with music accompaniment! Staff also patiently recommended dishes. Kudos! Presentation of dishes set off 'wows' at the table. Overall food is not bad except for the grilled fish which was on the expensive side. Midway through dinner music was turned on however it was too loud for decent communication during dinner. We informed the staff about it but was told that they were not allowed to turn the volume down??!!Dishes were not changed during dinner, and staff did not check if we would like to doggy back our pineapple beef which had a good portion remaining. Overall some hits and misses!
4
As it was eve of public holiday, restaurant was packed. My friends n I love the noodles n fried rice. The firecracker chicken was too hot for us.
4
The concept of lokkee is very interesting and the fusion food served was great too! However, i think that the service can be better improved because it takes some time before someone actually react to our requests.
4
Interesting presentations of the food wowed my group. Must tries are the fried chicken buns, both spicy and non spicy versions, bakkwa salad and the chow mein. Service could have been better though. Staff were rather sullen though attentive.
4
The food was good, especially the flaming pineapple beef and shrimp noodles. Most of the food was instagram worthy and yet still tasted good.
5
Again, dining at Lokkee never fails our expectations and continue to exceed it. Great food and value for using. 1-1 AMEX (but got notice the promo is going to be canceled). Wasted.
4
Food is good and Staff is friendly. Quite disappointed with the noodles. services to add hot water is abit slow.
5
My second time here. The food quality never fail to delight me. Love the mapo tofu and chow mien! The Angus beef was good too- tender.
5
We used the Amex Palette card so at 50% off, the meal was much more reasonably priced. The highlight was doubtly the thick and delicious eggdrop soup - it even came with bits of crab inside. The beef fried rice was served in such a large portion that the two of us could not finish it - the pieces of meat were generous and were tender. The mushu pork was also tender and rather good tasting. The banana egg rolls were amazing - melted in your mouth once you bit through the crispy skin. If they were served with dark chocolate sauce, I'd find it extremely hard not to come back for more! The beancurd barley with Gingko nuts dessert was alright though I had expected a larger portion for something priced at $6
5
Unlike the other traditional Chinese restaurant, Lokkee has added in creativity in their menu. Personally, I am in love with the Firecracker Chicken Nest, where the deep-fried chicken is served with unique mango purÃ©e in an egg shell. However, the dessert Fried Mantou ice cream is slightly disappointing as quite common. Overall, I would recommend Lokkee and will still go back to try other dishes. :)
4
Serves Extraordinary Modern Chinese food and very impressive. Love their Firecracker Chicken Nest - was surprised that the 4 egg yolks were actually mango puree, quite refreshing. Hokkien famous of their "Kong Bak Pau" but I think Lokkee "Pork Crackling Bao" can be for Cantonese version - what a creative dish having Crispy Pork Belly in it and not too oily. The Cereal Egg Floss Oysters is also a new dish on the menu. Overall Good!
4
2nd visit, food is still great with fun and unusual presentation style. staff were quite sthorthanded and busy on the day we went, but did their best to serve us. suitable to bring both locals and overseas guests
3
The dishes were good and sort of Creative combination but the price is costly. For 2 persons we spent about $96 for 3 dishes.
4
The food always surprise me. However, services was rather slow during weekend. The food portion is also getting smaller.
4
It was a 'Good Food! Good Place! Good People!' experience for me! Wasn't all great because I can't eat some food in the menu (e.g. Beef) ; it would be amazing if they can attempt it with chicken or pork!
4
Chanced upon this restaurant while browsing the web for dinner choices. And was glad I tried it - the food and service made this place worth another visit if I have the chance next. Recommended!
5
The restaurant have lots of creativity in the food. The taste is unique too. However the pricing is a bit steep.
4
Interesting Chinese fusion cuisine. Service was prompt and personal, making it overall a very comfortable place to dine in.
Fav dish was the grilled fish and the fried rice!
5
The restaurant serves tasty food. The service as good too. My mum enjoyed her 70th birthday, will go back again.
5
I heard Lokkee was good but I didn't expect it to be -this- good! The menu is a little on the pricey side but for the quality of the food and service, it's worth it all. Oh, and during happy hour, you get a free serving of fried fish skin with your drink. But don't let that stop you from ordering the deep fried truffle white bait.
5
My husband and I left the restaurant feeling satisfied (and with some takeaway as the serving was big). Ordered the Pork Cracklin Bao, Fried Rice with X.O. sauce and Crab Meat, Mala Fish Fries and the Ultraviolent Oolong Lemon Tea. The drink changed from blue to purple, pretty magical experience! >.
4
I was feeling unwell and decided to have simple dishes. When my Husband suggested Lok Kee, I expected rich, heavy type of lunch . I was pleasantly surprised at the delicious and elegantly presented food.
3
difficult to get waiter attention when needed help.
location near mrt
used $50 voucher for min spending of $150, still end up paying $160+ after it.
4
Staff was attentive, gave good recommendations. Every one in the family enjoyed all the dishes. We were especially intrigued by the "egg yolk" in the firecracker chicken dish! Had a really great experience.
1
Food is mediocre at it best with lots of MSG, food presentation and restaurant decoration is good and that's it. Service standard is so horrible that I can't believe that I actually stepped into Tung Lok group of restaurants. Manager is strutting around, one waiter was fawning over a table of elderly ladies, and my request for water refill was ignored by the very same waiter. The restaurant was not even half filled and I can't find excuses to placate myself for the lapse in service. I will not recommend anyone to go or revisit the restaurant again
4
Selected this restaurant mainly because of online reviews on its food presentation. I wasn't surprised because I've seen them online but my friends were. Ordered the flaming pineapple beef, Bak kwa bacon salad, crabmeat fried rice, Ginseng chicken soup, cheese wanton, chin ha lok (off menu), bacon ice cream and gingko tofu beancurd. Only 2 of the dishes have "wow" presentation effect. Overall taste rating is about 3.5 to 4. Staffs were friendly and helpful. Very willing to accept special order (e.g exclude X.O sauce for fried rice & serving chin ha lok
5
The food was good! The more unique stuff were the steamed mushroom bao with custard filling and the chilli crab cakes, which were pleasing to the palette. I loved the crab fried rice with XO sauce as well. The famous firecracker chicken nest was nice, but a little too hot for me. The mango puree that came with the dish was refreshing after the spicy fried chicken
5
Awesome place with a fun take on fusion food. From using dried ice smoke effects, to a drink that changes color, to egg looking mango, all the food ordered here is really fun to look at and admire. And most importantly the food still taste good. A bit pricey though, but I guess with the effort they put into making the dining experience a fun and tasty one, it's worth it especially if you are looking for a place to eat for special occasions :
1
-waiting 10 mins to be seated, as nobody entertained us while standing at the door-guided to our table, no tea was served and no menu was given.-could not get attention of wait staff ,waited aimlessly for another 20 mins while waiting for friends to arrive-helped ourselves to the menu-after placing order of 5 dishes,only 3 came within 1.5 hrs, while the other 2 were still missing-white rice only came when we finish the 2nd dish-helped ourselves to the refill of hot water for our tea as could not get the attention of the wait staff again-canceled the last 2 dishes finally as it was getting outrageously long-was told there was a technical issue in the kitchen causing the delay, but somehow they were still seating unsuspecting new patrons, which i find it weird because they can never dish out the food in time.Overall: nothing went well with this reservation
4
I ordered "mapo" tofu, pineapple beef, egg drop soup, and crab meat fried rice.All the foods are recommended. However, the serving time should speed up. Each dishes wait about 5 mins to serve after finished the previous dish.Recommend if you don't mind waiting and alot to chit-chat with your friends
1
We placed our order at 8.25pm. After more than 40mins, our food still not serve while the table beside us came later was served with their food. Decided to check with the waitress, and immediately serve us a cold plate of chicken which I believe it was left there for quite some time. Throughout our visit, we have seen many of the waiters not know what's the order of the customers. They kept bringing the food to the tables asking the customers if they have order the food. We have been asked several times which really annoyed us
4
service is a little chaos. not much to say, but the food is quite creative. only thing to improve, may be the ambient of the restaurant could be quieter
4
I take the main course of the cold sea food. there are so many raw shrimps I can not finish. If we could ask for cooked those raw shrimps in the future.
4
I would come back again for any kind of gathering ! The Lou Heng, grilled fish and bakwa salads are pretty impressive !
5
Good food n value for money. Serving was enough for a table of four pax. Would come back again for more food
4
Service is prompt and food is not too bad. Portion is big which is very hard for 2 Pax to order unless one opt for set menu.
5
The wet tissue packaging tickled us! Then we sat back and enjoyed the mist and fire in presenting the food, simply entertaining.
Portion is good too. We will definitely go again.
4
Lokkee is part of the Tung Lok group and attempts to reach those of us who are getting jaded palettes. So most of the dishes have a twist, some more visual than substance. The braised beef in pineapple comes in a pineapple that is lit. Good theater but the fire is so modest there is no chance of it heating the contents let alone adding any flavor. The bukkwa salad was both theater and had some substance. Though the pool of dry ice meant that anything that fell from the bowl was inedible (the meat dangles from a trapeze). My favorite was the barramundi in dancing crab sauce, moist fish with a distinct and edgy flavor. The prawn and garlic noodle was a yawn and the pork cracking bao was too heavy (the bao needed to be more like a sponge). Entertaining and worth going with the right crowd
5
Was at Lokkee for a dinner with 4 friends and had a great time. It started with a good laugh over the "towels" (see attached) which shocked us a little when we first saw the little packets. We had the duck (excellent), General Tso's chicken (good) etc. The Yu Sheng was very good too.Service was very attentive and it was clear the staff had good training (rare in Singapore).Only slight glitch was the sudden very loud Birthday song they played for another table, which we thought was unnecessary and gave us a bit of a fright.Would come back
4
For the 4 of us, we ordered a Seafood Fried Rice, Firecracker Chicken Nest, Stir-fried Kale, King Crab Soup, Wok-fried Rice Cake and 4 desserts. Some are worth the $, but one or two might seem expensive.. As 2 of the diners do not take beef, I won't mind to return to try the signature Flaming Pineapple Beef
4
The food presentation was great, interesting and fun. The food tasted a lot better than it looks. The only feedback was that because we were in a private room it was hard to call the wait staff. Perhaps a bell could be installed in the room to inform the staff if we needed assistance. It was a very pleasant visited. Exceeded expectation
5
Portion was good for family.
Although they mention each dish for 3-4 pax but I think it is reasonable for 6-8 pax. Taste is great. And great presentation too.
Had 9 dishes with their mermaid fish.
Cost $370.
5
Customer service was excellent from the point I entered the restaurant until I finished my meal. The staff took initiative to recommend dishes and explaining them one by one when it was served. Especially recommend the bacon salad!! Food was really good.
4
Overall have a good time and good food. We tried the firecracker chicken, bakkua salad, flaming pineapple..
5
Three of us ordered 6 dishes simply because everything on the menu look so good! Delicious food with unique presentation. Highly recommended! Will visit again!
5
We enjoyed our Christmas Dinner at Lok Kee. The service rendered by the staff is excellent. Food served is timely and delicious. Highly recommended is the Bakwah Bacon Salad, Firecracker Chicken Nest, Mongolian Beef, Honey Pecan Shrimp. Yummy and you will come back for more!!!
5
Staff was friendly and professional. The food arrived fast and was good. A great place for everyone.
5
only 2 of us so we ordered the spicy chicken and a crab meat fried rice. wish i could have ordered more as the dishes looked really interesting. large portions, i think what we ordered could have fed 3. the spicy chicken was really quite good, lurved the presentation and taste. each bite was great. generous ingredients. would def come back again, possibly w a larger group.
4
I booked this restaurant after reading many review, and I have to say this place did meet my expectation in terms of ambience, & taste. There is happy hour if you come between 5-7pm, which comes with complimentary plate of fish skin!:) I booked reservations via Chope, which Chope also offers 10% disc if you purchase vouchers from them ($45 paid for $50 value) - satisfied with Chope!The only hiccup they had was that there was a small insect in my orange mojito, which they changed a whole new drink for me upon informing them.Price: ~$45/pax with drinks at happy hourTaste: 4/5Accessibility: 100% (parking at plaza sing isnt that expensive)Overall: 4/
3
I ordered the infamous flaming pineapple which has beef,carrot and pineapple in a hallow out pineapple. It taste good hot but cooled down, the meat has greasy after taste.Then I had the chow mien, despite the container looking so small. The portion is actually enough for 3 of us.Then the appetizer of a corn cone with a dish of fish and some other stuff tasted OK. But the price they set is to expensive for a dish that contain corn, peas , flakes of fish. Felt a bit cheated
4
The restaurant can be a bit noisy, maybe we were sitting in between 3 families as big as us. London duck was a disappointment, as compared to London Fat Duck below Scotts Square. Can try the Bacon salad if you have not. Cheese wonton was a bit pricey at 10 for 4 pieces. Tomato broth fish is good for kids and old folks as is a big piece of barramuddi filet with no bones at all. Is only 1 size costing $58 or 68 (i cant remember) which I thought is a bit pricey. Overall food taste and presentation is good
3
Food was nice! Especially the mala grilled fish. However, the staff were not very responsive. Still a good place to dine though.
4
This is my 3rd time here and the food was as good as before. Like the whole experience though the pricey is a bit high. Recommended to visit.
4
Place was not too crowded for a weekend.
We ordered the signature fried rice in XO sauce, and the bakkwa salad with General Tso's chicken. Good standard for the food. Beautiful placement/setting. Portion size was generous. Prices are above average.
4
Ambience is good. We like all the dishes we ordered, except for the tomato grill fish - not what we expected.
4
Very innovative and delicious menu. We had the lamb pockets, salmon belly nuggets and stir fry brussel sprouts with garlic. Do not miss the desserts too. The fried mantou with caramel ice cream is really good. Will definitely be back
3
I ordered crab meat fried rice it is value for money. I also ordered oriental spice cocktail, it is surprising good for a chinese resturant to serve cocktail.
3
This fusion restaurant is a tad pricey. The kale soup came in a pretty soup warmer set-up but the soup bowl was so shallow that there was not much soup in it. Got about half of a normal soup serving in other restaurants.
4
Service was good - we brought a slice of cake to celebrate a birthday and told them to bring it out after dinner. They took the effort to plate it really nicely (with dry ice and all) and even played the birthday song. Food was good; we enjoyed the grilled fish, firecracker nest and flaming beef but value-for-money wise, not quite. Food was expensive.
4
Been there twice. Love their "flaming pineapple" the most. Their crab meat fried rice is generously topped with fresh crab meat pieces. Service was wonderful despite the crowd. Food is simply one of the best Chinese restaurant around. Will definitely go back to try more dishes again!
2
Considering that this is one of the establishments within the Tung Lok group, you would be shocked to have wait staff who are not attentive and food that are amateurish. Especially their so-called recommendations such as the roasted pork which was poorly prepared. Not crispy at all, and noodles that are not even soggy and cooked in butter
5
nice funky restaurant.. everything is about visual.. take a closer look and you will see why,
and not only does everything (including food) looks nice they taste nice too!!
3
Food is ok and if you want to try out new place. Price a bit high for the quality. Don't go for the gimmick!
4
Service was smooth and the food was delicious. Though there was a crowd during lunch time, the food was served promptly.
4
Beautiful plating &good taste. Especially so for the firecracker chicken nest which was served with mango pudding. Really refreshing &helps to alleviate the numbness from the mala spice.
5
- Good is nice
- Accessible
- Food served fast
- Friendly staff
- Prompt services
- Decent varieties
4
Nice place. Presentation of food is good. Ambiance is good too. Food is rather expensive though, but can come back again.
5
Celebrated colleagues' birthday lunch there and the contemporary Chinese food was delicious, service level was so so though.
4
Flaming Pineapple Beef is the highlight of the meal. XO Sauce Crab Meat Fried Rice is well executed with good wok hei. But my favourite if the Lai Zi Ji (Deep Fried Chicken with Dried Chilli). I will consider Lokkee a much healthier outlet serving well executed Sichuan Food.
4
The restaurant is a little hard to find in a middle of a shopping mall without signs. Staff is friendly and food very good. Several dishes have interesting presentation were you are tricked into believing you eat something else than it actually is. The locally sourced Barramundi was one of the best I have ever had.
4
very fun experience! fusion Asian food with unique twists, most of which were a hit not just in (slightly gimmicky) presentation, but very importantly in taste as well. restaurant was very crowded on the evening we went, so service staff were a little harried and rushed, and it could also get a bit too noisy. but all in all, we had a good time. we booked via Chope and bought/used Chope vouchers too. nice to go back again with big groups and for the novelty experienc
4
The food was pretty good with nice presentation. The design of the wet tissue was really unexpected as the theme of the place was very oriental. Nice place.
4
Not your typical Chinese restaurant with Star Wars drawings, wet tissue in what could be mistaken as condom packing. Creative dishes but could use with periodic refresh to maintain novelty factor.
5
Nice food and service. The waiter smiled and told us no need to show the Facebook page to enjoy the Nathan 25% discount. Generous owner Tong Lok!
4
The chicken dish with mango puree is amazing. The mango puree offers a unique experience and is a must try!
4
Was here for dinner, the food was good but can be better. Suggest to have different portions such as S, M or L so that those with only two persons who dine in can have a varieties of food choices.
2
Food quality is good and pretty tasty but not fantastic. Portion is extremely small for the price. We concluded that it is for people who are cautions of diet and only nibble small bites. Not a place to go if you want hearty meal.
4
Food is ok, presentation look good, taste is just normal. Price is on the high side. Is under Tung Lok group, so usually is a bit expensive. If you hold AMEX card, you get 50% off but not all types of AMEX card which with other perks like krisflyer. UOB get 10% off. 5 dishes after discount is $122/-.
4
We ordered the lamb pockets and the monthly special of mala salmon belly. Both dishes are well executed and flavourful. However, the crispy pork belly was a real disappointment. The pork belly has almost no fats on them and they are all so dry! It felt like they have been left out in the open for too long! Do not order this dish! Service was prompt and friendly.
5
Not too crowded, but noisy enough to feel like we were in a happening place. Flaming pineapple was interesting - meat was tender but a bit fatty. Mapo tofu was fantastic as was the fish maw soup. Lobster wrapped in lettuce leaf was also fantastic. Suggest that a minimum of 4 pax needed to really get a variety of food. Otherwise a bit wasted...
4
What make a good Chinese meal? Not too greasy, not too much msg, taste like what ur grandma cooking but in a posh refine manner. The original taste of the food is there but the delightful surprise makes customer happy. From the tea towel, noodle in box, flaming pineapple, mango as yolk all are enhancement to the food taste wise and vision wise. I love it whenever u know a Chef make an effort to up the food to Ensure it looks and taste good. Even a simple fried noodle with garlic and shrimp taste so nice. Thumb up
5
Great service and very interesting food (taste and presentation). Birthday celebration is also something you must try!
5
We did not expect such an innovative presentation on the desserts despite not serving birthday cakes there. The food is extremely yummy and the service surpassed our expectations!! Kudos to Lokkee and be sure to see us again soon!! =D
4
Had roast pork, ginseng chicken soup, mapo tofu, garlic noodles and mushu pork. All was good except the mushu pork that was slightly too chewy. Especially liked the ginseng chicken soup (enough for 4-6 to share) and mapo tofu (soft and silky tofu).
4
Nice food and nice environment. Food is fantastic and unique as is recommended by my friend, will visit again
5
Brought our friend from UK to Lokkee for dinner last week. All four of us enjoyed the Chinese-fusion food. The foods were delicious and nicely presented. That was my 2nd visit to the restaurant within 3 weeks, and definitely will have more....
5
Absolutely enjoyed the food. There was a slight hiccup as I requested for a birthday song when they delivered the desserts and they didn't. Subsequently they did it and gave a complimentary (customized) dessert. Brilliant!
4
Service staff was very attentive to our needs and provided good recommendation on the 'must try' dishes
3
My Mom and I went to Lokkee Plaza Spura for lunch for the first time. We ordered the Firecracker Chicken, Garlic Baby Kailan and the Crystal Pork Dumpling Soup. The deepfried chicken tossed in the dried chilis, cashew nuts and sesame seeds were delicious with just the right amount of spiciness. We had a good laugh over the mango puree balls disguised as egg yolks. A very nice touch and visually appealing. Baby Kailan was tender and nicely seaoned. While the two crystal skinned 小龙包 were tasty, the soup was a disappointment. It was bland and unimpressive; not worth the $7 price tag for each bowl. I will still return to try the other dishes
4
Fried Kale was delicious and the texture was different from Kale found in most restaurants. Pineapple beef presentation was good with lots of showmanship flare, however the taste is pretty average stew beef. I would prefer if the beef had less tendon, making it easier to chew. Desert was a fried banana wrapped in popiah skin with coconut icecream, tasted like goreng pisang w icecream. Restaurant was not crowded when we were there and the service crew are attentive enough
5
My family enjoyed the dinner at Lokkee with awe and good taste for the food order. We loved the Awesome F,laming Pineapple Beef, Fire Cracker Nest Chicken,3-Drop Pyramid Brocolli, the Baked Oyster with Bacon and the Banana Egg Roll. It's so yummy & memorable that I brought more friends to the restaurant
3
Food was not bad. But the music did not suit the atmosphere. The chilli sauce was cheap and totally a mismatch to the overall outlook and pricing.
4
Food quality is good, tasty and portion is good for sharing too. Price is abit on the pricey side. Acoustic of the interior is very poor.
5
The staff were attentive to our request. Food served hot. And dishes were fresh and delicious. Overall nice
5
Great food great service!! will definitely visit again. price was a little on the steep side but for the food quality and service, i think its money well spent.
4
Service was impeccable. A little pricey though. Food not as spicy as we thought. Portion of food is quite huge.
3
The food is not bad at all. Above average.
The price is a little too steep.
The place is chic and fun.
The staff is friendly.
the End.
4
The Food quality were good but unfortunately each portion was just right for only 2-3 pax. Hence, for family dinning in big groups above 4persons, you would need to order extra portions if you want to try the food. Overall, staff was attentive to our needs and their service was above expectations. We will definitely visit again to try out their other dishes as there were a lot of varieties on their menu which we are unable to order at one visit
4
1st time there after hearing the fusion food specialities.The reception staff seems cold and no smile but we were comfortable after being serve by a friendly staff and she was really nice to us and even load an order first knowing it will be sold out soon before taking the rest.Food were unique but nice and the flaming pineapple beef stew was soft and big portion. London duck was really soft n good.But the best is the Mala fish in hot pot. $68 is steep but portion is big and enough for 4 person easily.Crispy pork bao was good.Only miss was the barley with lotus seed and bean curd. It's too sweet n too thick n dry.Will go back again to try other dishes but advise to others is the prices are a bit steeper than normal.If you have Amex Platinum card you can enjoy their discount though
4
I love the vibe of this place. it's so quirky and there are so many pop culture references that cover the walls of the place. the mains were delish and my friend and i enjoyed every single bite.the dessert was interesting, especially since we ordered one that looked like real mushrooms! what was disappointing was the taste though. my friend lynette took the photofood is a lil' pricy but fine cos it was yummy
3
visited LK today as we wanted to pick up our eldest kid after work. saw the place which was featured in Straits Times recently about London Duck. first visit so tried half london duck, chicken salad, kale in garlic, sweet sour pork in skewers. all tasted good and presentation was interesting including using dry ice for the pork skewers. these items were marked recommended and had the chinese character "å¥½" for "good".the most interesting moment was when we were seated and saw the individial wet tissue packet packed like a condom package and its so real and similar. cant tell the difference from far until its picked up...service was prompt and friendly. a bit noisy but its bearable. can come back and try other items on the menu
2
1 hit goes to Mongolian stir fried beef.
1 Miss goes to the fried chow mein in take away box
1 miss goes to random vegetables
the worst dish goes to the custard bun in the shape of mushroom dessert, really horrible
4
Had a good dinner at lokke..will visit again to try the other savoury dishes they offer instead of the dessert.
4
Great food with cool presentation. Nice funky modern chinese restaurant with an artsy vibe n good music. Staff are helpful but the team needs to be more coordinated. Worth revisiting.
4
food was great, the portions are good for sharing. service was good even though place was packed. we would have preferred a round table for convenience of sharing but these were fully booked and only offered to bigger groups.we planned a surprise birthday cake for my dad, cake was pre-purchased externally but staff helped us plate it on a dry ice bowl for effect. the song played over the speakers so it was kind of embarrassing but it was a delightful surprise for him nonetheless. the restaurant decor was quirky, contemporary but oriental elements dominated
5
Bored by plain old food servings? Then perhaps you should give Lokkee a try! I know I was definitely surprised by their novel take on the presentation of fusion food. From the entrance Lokkee looked just like any Chinese restaurant albeit with a tad more decor. However my sharp eye saw a bust of Boba Fett sipping bubble milk tea and my interest was piqued. Chinese ink paintings of C-3PO and AT-AT recited the story of Star Wars, Chinese style, alongside another similar ink painting of an Alien xenomorph's anatomy, all hanging calmly to match the Chinese interior decor as if there was nothing unusual for them to be there. And to notch things up, I was confused by the pack on my plate until I realized that they were not condoms but wet tissues. Talk about misleading...Lokkee is perhaps the hippest Chinese restaurant I have been to. They have redefined the meaning of fusion food, a term usually invoke images of western fried rice or some chops with Chinese side dishes or gravy. What Lokkee offered is what I would imagine fusion food should be
4
The promise of an interesting lunch began with the wet towelette that is packed like a common birth control item. The flaming pineapple was entertaining and the magic mushroom custard buns was a good conversation piece. The beef in the pineapple was a let down, but the other dishes like fried kale, firecracker chicken and fried fish skin made it a good lunch.i did find that the prices were rather steep for the type of food served; guess we were paying for the novelty of the experience
2
had friends recommended this resto so expected quality dishes for the price . every dish is full of MSG my tongue felt different after eating plus most dishes are way too salty. (crab meat fried rice, beef fried rice, most especially the chicken with mango puree dish,kale in garlic...i can go on..)i did like the fried chicken bao and the duck with plum was not bad.
4
The restaurant is very unique in decorations with black paper cuttings on the walls. The food are unique and the staff are very friendly. It is conveniently located in the mall. My only grouses are that we were initially neglected as the 10 of us were seated in a big table at the corner but that improved in the later part of the night. The drinks we ordered took a long while. Overall, our experience have been wonderful and we will go back to Lokkee again.
3
I am regular customer of Lokkee. when I requested for a round table for 7persons they flatly refused my request . there condition is that in order to have a round table I must order at least $400.00 worth of food . I told them that I cannot be sure that my order will come to $400.00 The Manager flatly refuse to exceed my request saying that it is THE MANAGEMENT RULE..So after much haggling over it I I decided not to budge and flatly told the Manager that I will not eat there and when all my quest arrive I will direct them to another restaurant . To my utter disbelief your idiotic Manager encourages me to do so.However I have to persuade your Manager that I will order at least $400,00 in order not disrupt my lunch time dates and he stupidly agreed even though I know that I will not spend $400.00. It appears that your Manager needs proper training in the art dealing with people and he should be not be so inflexible as to follow the Management blindly and use his discretion. The fact pf the matter was that there were four empty round tables vacant, I also want to highlight the fact that when I booked for a table I specifically asked for ROUND TABLE. IF YOUR RESTNT HAS A RULE THAT IMUST S;END $400.00 THEN i SHOULD BE TOLD AND I DEFINITELY WILL NOT PATRONISE YOUR RESTNT. ANYWAY WE WILL NO LONGER PATRONISE YOUR RESTNT IN THE FUTUR
2
Planned my Fathers' Day Dinner at Lokkee as my past experiences with the restaurant were really pleasant and satisfying. Wanted my parents to experience the unique dining concept as this will be their first visit.Booked my table for 4 pax using Chope, got my table as soon as I arrived. (Good!)Food Order / Waiting time - Fast. But as the waiting time was long (approx. 30+ mins) , we were only notified that one of our appetiser was not available at least 20 minutes after we placed our order, would definitely appreciate that the staff to notify us earlier for us to order an alternative dish.Food Quality - Food taste was comparable to before but definitely not the serving size. Ordered Firecracker Chicken Nest, Honey Walnut Shrimp, Mapo Tofu and Stir-Fried Kale as main dishes. 3 out of 4 dishes were what I ordered usually and their portion were not as before (Pathetically lesser!)Firecracker Chicken Nest- Overflowing dried chilli covering the chicken pieces. After each one of us took a piece each, only left about 4 to 5 pieces remaining. Comparing the portion to my past visits, the chicken ratio were at least 3:1 to the dried chilli. Honey Walnut Shrimp - No more rock melon balls as per last time. Mapo Tofu - Depth of Tofu in the bowl were only about 1/4 full as compared to 1/2 full last time.Stir-Fried Kale - First time order. Not bad but for a Vegetable dish, it cost a whopping $18. Too much?!Due to their pathetic portions, ended up ordering 2 more Bao dishes to fill our stomachs.Overall, long waiting time and poor portioning just deterred us from visiting again. Gave me a feeling that once a restaurant gain its popularity, standard of food had been compromised

Nice place to come for a dinner with friends. Nice menu including a modern twist to many singaporean chinese dishes. Perfect with a few beers.
5
Second visit to the restaurant in a private room. Interesting fusion Chinese food that excite our palate. Service is fast and crew is friendly.
4
The food were good and quite a different dinning experience as compared to other Tung Lok restaurants. Service staff were polite and efficient. Food are nicely presented although a bit pricey.
3
quite limited in variety, food is served in interesting way and the taste is quite good, though more towards the salty side....
5
Food is great and unique. Service is great, and the staff are friendly. Chicken in a Nest is a must try. Gingko nut and barley dessert comes with uniquely made "gingko balls".
4
XO fried rice and brussel sprouts with braised pork belly were v good. Had the spicy chicken bao too and thought that it was not nice..
4
This is my 2nd visit here. My in-laws really loved the food and the presentation. We got a great service staff who helped us when we had trouble cutting the ice cream birthday cake :)
4
Good dining ambience, brightly lit space that allows you to pay attention to your food. The service was also prompt and good (we had problem looking for a parking lot and the restaurant was nice enough to hold the reservations for us). Menu has decent variations and variety, the ingredients were fresh and taste was really good, in particular the stir-fry brussel sprouts and flaming pineapple beef
4
food was so good except desserts.highly recommend the prawn and pecan dish. yummothe desserts... there was this mushroom thing which looked so real and it was so well presented upon tasting fell flat as did the mantou icecream thing. I'd suggest you admire the decor, stick to appetisers and mains... head elsewhere for dessert.love the decor. some were cheesy but all adorable. a geek like me loved the pop culture references.Simpsons mural... Boba fett drinking bubble tea lolI'll be back

Was there on a weekday night and the restaurant's occupancy was half full or less. There were sufficient staff but they were unattentive and disinterested in working. Slow service, waited long for food. Firecracker chicken was good. Custard buns were not. Too much flour and too little custard. The bun was tough as well. Will not go there if not for Amex's 50% off
4
Yummy food & excellent service by a lady who seem to be manager. We tried crab cake, mushroom chop suey, mushu pork, xo crab meat fried rice, chow mein & pork cracklins bao
4
This is my first time here. I like the decor, the service is very good, excellent chinese speaking waitress and Malsysian cook probably who came out to speak to my parents. The food is more
of fusion, we thought it was a bit oily.
4
Food presentation were nice, menu more on the expensive side. Food tasted pretty nice. Service was not bad, ambience was peaceful until they started playing English songs slightly loudly in the restaurant.
5
Each dish was a pleasant discovery. Service was great and my 13 year old absolutely loved the music.
4
Food taste and quality are above expectation. Unique presentation too. Comfortable atmosphere but limited choice for desserts.
4
Good food and service. Interesting menu. But the music was abit too loud to have nice conversations. Alot of showmanship in preparation of the food.
4
all is good except, birthday song play was too loud n too long😃 It would be nicer if the staff gather together n sing it for the birthday person.
3
love the food but service requires improvement. staff was less attentive. Was seated, but host did not provide menu and we sat there like fool for a few minutes, no body attended to us. culinary is more on the spicy side too, a lot of mala, but definitely delicious

Tucked away in a corner of Plaza Singapura, is a surprising restaurant. It takes the "traditions" of the classic Western Chinese takeaway but gives it a modern twist with a reasonably decent bar service as well. Service is a tad slow, but you forgive them because the dishes are really quite well done.
3
Chinese fusion...they try hard on the presentation, like a burning pineapple, or frying beef table side in a hot pot.It's ok. Food is decent. Prices are on the high side. In Singapore where the options are immense and the standard high, I would have to say you can get better food and better prices at a lot of place
4
The meal was good and price was reasonable for Tung Lok Group.
Must try here is the fish that comes in a sweet n sour soup that has no oil at home.

Lokkee is a true wonder !It has slices of mango that is pretended to be egg yolk with chicken .Then ,there was some rice .We also ordered the soup and ,the chicken.

Went there on 26 Mar 2016 to celebrate my boyf dad's birthday.The food was great. I highly recommends the Baked Oyster with Bacon, X.O Sauce Crab Meat Fried Rice & Tomato Broth Grilled Fish.We were greeted with a condom looking wet tissue upon seated. It was quite interesting and amusing at the same time.The service was great and they played birthday song and served the cake on a bowl filled of dry ice with water. Effort much :D We had a pleasant dinner :
5
We had a very enjoyable meal here (on the recommendation of friends). The food is fantastic, the Flaming Pineapple Beef, Ma Po Tofu and Ginseng chicken soup were delicious, and the Firecracker chicken had just the right amount of Ma La - yummy! The predation was excellent, as was the service
5
First time to dine at Lokkee Restaurant and my girlfriend told me that it is under Tung Lok Group. I was late as my friends were already waiting for me to arrive. I saw a very interesting cool packet and found it was amusing and cracked a little joke. I will not mention in the trip advisor till you visited this restaurant. Guess the restaurant manager, Wilson Lin, heard my laughter. He came to introduce himself as gave his business card to us. The food were great. We had crispy fish skin, London duck, Si Chuan Mala fish (strongly recommended), 3 eggplant broccoli and we had a complimentary custard eggs and design like a mushroom. It made you water mouthing and feel like coming again to eat.... I will

I went to Plaza Singapore and look up the directory on 3/F for the location of the restaurant...it was not there! (And I think still is not on the directory...)A bit worried, I called the restaurant and was told next to Lao Beijing - that is in the directory. Phew! Don't have to call my dinner guests to change dinner venue...But that was the end of my worries that night...except how to digest all those good food I had!The meal was really good.We ordered the signature fish - the taste was AWESOME! Fish was fresh, and loved the slightly sourish soup base. Had the beef in pineapple - beef is so tender and loved the pineapple balls that was flavored in the sauceThe mapo tofu was unique - served looking like douhua (beancurd) and they poured the sauce into the bowl (it was served in a deep bowl) - silky tofu, flavorful sauce; perfect blend!Their signature duck looked ordinary (we ordered half duck, came in two servings), but I fell in love with it on first bite! Usually duck is quite tough to bite into, but this has got a wonderful aroma and tenderness that made me think I was eating tender juicy chicken instead.The chicken in a nest although was equally good, but the fact that the chicken pieces are quite big did not balance the flavor well, so was at the bottom of our list.All in all, food was excellent!Although be prepared to shout a little to be heard by your dinner guests, when the restaurant is busy.Oh, plan a celebration at the restaurant...try it and share your experience :)Will definitely plan another visit soon!

The food at Lokkee is special - both in taste and in its presentation. Many customers will stand up, take out the phone and snap like crazy when the flaming pineapple is served.More importantly the service is friendly. Samuel treats his customers like friends and offers good advice on the dishes.Tip -Ask for the Custard bun at the end of your meal. You will be delighted by this dessert.

The meal here was very tasty. We tried the London Duck and fish skin appetizer and they were very good among other dishes. Service was great as the servers checked on us and were very available if we needed help. My only complaint is that the restaurant cannot sit a group of more than 7 people
4
Went there to celebrate my mum's birthday, there are 7 of us. The restaurant gave us a long table. When we ask for a round table, they said the round table are for spending above $400 only. So one can imagine how inconvenient it is to share the food. The person at the far end is unable to reach the food at the other end & we got to pass the food around. Other than this inconvenience, the food is nice. We order the flaming pineapple, the steam fish, spicy chicken, pasta, noodle, a duck & some appetizers. The portion for main courses are good enough for 7 persons but the portion for appetizers are abit small (just like French fine dinning). The choices on the menu is also quite limited. A good restaurant to go for small group

A new concept Chinese restaurant by TungLok Group. When stepped into the restaurant, the colours of the restaurant is red and black but taking a closer look, ou can actually see English influence in the restaurant. Chinese ink paintings with robots and dinosaurs. The packaging of the wet tissue is innovative as with one look, really look like packaging of condom. Good marketing.Food more of Sichuan that is "mala". Ordered 4 dishes: Firecracker Chicken Nest, Sichuan Mala fish fries, Mapo Tofu and Minced Beef Fried Rice.The servers are attentive and refill the tea promptly without asking. The represent of the foods are very nice as well. When Firecracker Chicken Nest was served, we were looking at the "look-a-like" egg yolk nesting in the egg shell as it look lraw egg yolk. To our surprise is actually mango puree. Really cooool.....!!! The diced chicken do taste "mala". Mapo Tofu is also highly recommended, freshly made tofu that can taste of the soya bean and pour over with tasty spice minced beef sauce. Really good.Minced beef fried rice was served in a take away container. The fried rice is well cooked with wok hei taste, rice are not stick together, really good and tasty.Sichuan mala fish fries is also very nice but recommend to eat if finish while is still hot as it taste better when is hot. Don't be fool by the "mala", because is not that "mala" as i thought. Satisfy with the overall experiences. Price range reasonable, will visit again to try other dishes
