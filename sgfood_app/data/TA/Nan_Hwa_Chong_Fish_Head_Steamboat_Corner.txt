Very tasty flavourful fish soup in a charcoal steamboat. Also fantastic prawn paste chicken wings. Gets extremely crowded at the weekends but I think they take reservations.

Food was good. They propose some western food useful for children. Plates were very full we could not finish. They do not propose real dessert that is a little bit pity.

Located at the junction of Jalan Sultan and North Bridge Road, this steamboat establishment has been around for many years (moved from its original location nearby).The highlight is naturally fish head steamboat, from which you can choose between pomfret / red garoupa / 2 others which I can't recall. Can also choose S / M / L. The soup is very tasty and they will top up if you request for more soup. Fish seemed fresh too, no fishy smell.The other highlight for us was also the prawn paste chicken, which was very nicely done and we had to order a second plate.Other dishes:- Nai bai (vegetable) was good- Omelette was so so, nothing to shout about- 排骨大王 (pork ribs) was nice but slightly too sweet for our taste budsFor party of 4 adults and 2 young children, bill came to $116, which we felt was just about decent considering we ordered medium size for almost all the dishes (fish steamboat, 3 meats, 1 omelette, 1 vegetable, rice, barley drinks).Overall, definitely where we will go if looking for nice warm fish soup / steamboat

Came for a birthday dinner with bookings made. Staff made no effort in showing me my table and just gestured for me to sit at a random table. Shortly after, another staff exclaimed loudly, asking me to leave the table and instigating that I just sat without any “permissions”. She didn’t even bother to apologise after realizing that the table was booked under my name. So much to start off my first visit here.Utensil pre-placed at the table were dirty and the food was salty. Food do taste good partly due to the vast amount of MSG added but well, that’s how they make their food taste good right? If you want terrible service, feel free to visit. Otherwise, there are other better fish head steamboat place in singapore to try.

I think there's aircon upstairs but we dislike sitting in A/C so we were downstairs in one of the smaller areas. Perfectly fine with it... had fans and it wasn't that hot.Waiter gives you the menu straight away and lingers to take your order... must try the steamboat (duh). We also had vegies, beancurt, pork ribs and fried noodles. Food is pretty good. Price is probably like restaurant prices more than dai pai dong but it is kind of famous.Enjoyed the steamboat.. medium for 3 ppl was perfect with some other dishes. Soup was very interesting

The Original Fishsoup says, this is the original one. Not the one opposite the road with the same name. Tried once, tried twice then many times. Best fish soup in Singapore. Small dishes are nice. Comfort Singaporean local food. Nothing fancy. Sincere setting. Old school service. If come in twos, please, just the soup is enough. There's enough in the soup to feed you. The rustic taste of the soup coupled with the small dishes makes want to go there for the 9th time

Highly recommended by many senior Singaporean.If you are looking for authentic local food, this is the one of the best Fish Steamboat in Singapore. Price is reasonable based on the portion you want and they will advised you if you ordered too many and what's their signature dishes. Although there is no aircon and they are using charcoal to boil the fish soup, you won't feel hot and stuffy. It located at the city center nearby Arab Street, Haji Lane and Bugis Shopping area. We have 5 adults and 1 kid, ordered 1 fish (red snapper) steamboat(4 types of fish to choose, all in different prices) and 4 other dishes with drinks and cost S$108, all in medium portion. Worthy and will recommend to others

So I tried their fish head steamboat for the first time in 2014, and I just loved it!The good part is that it's walking distance from the hotel I stay in everytime I visit Singapore.The even better part is that it's open till late.And the best part is that they serve one the best steamboats I have ever had!I am anyway a lover of all things soupy so when I took the first bite/sip I couldn't stop eating.This time it was a solo trip, and steamboats are too big for a single person to finish. But I couldn't have missed their steamboat. Ordered one and took my own time but slammed it all!They serve good noodles as well. And I love their fried pork and pork knuckles. Super yummy, fresh, and clean food! A must visit on my every trip

This establishment has been operating here for many years. Its opposite the textile centre along Jalan Sultan road. Amongst the fish steamboats, this is perhaps one of the better ones. Using charcoal instead of gas or electricity, the fish steamboat here taste really good. You can choose the type of fish that you want, from firm ones to flaky ones. Perpetually crowded despite tables spilling onto the sidewalk and upstairs. Worth the wait if you have the patience

short walk from the mrt station. you gotta to try their fish head steamboat (pomfret will be good). the soup is rich with flavours and taste great. if u like chicken wings, you gotta try their prawn paste chicken ($8 for 6 pc), really crispy and is totally mouth-watering.
4
The fish soup base is nice and the fish is fresh. Ordered a small fish head soup, 1 fried rice, 1 plain rice and a side dish costs $48 bucks. Moreover the fish is quite little.
4
Had a combination of food including the following- cereal prawns, crumbed chicken, pork knuckle pieces, seafood fried rice and green vegetables. All very good. We ate upstairs. Average tables and chairs but doesn't matter when food is so good!

Went there with Singaporean colleagues because Singaporeans were talking about this Fish Head Steamboat (hot pot) restaurant. It was pricey and actually, there is NO FISH HEAD in the Fish Head Steamboat. Do not go!!!!!

We went in for my first steamboat experience. The place was busy as. It was close to our hotel and we ended up going twice in 4 nights.

We reached this eatery at 7.30pm on a weekday, and we had to wait a while for a table to finish before they could set up a larger table for our party of 10. Once seated, we placed our order which includes a large red grouper steamboat, kai lan, apple chicken, sweet & sour pork, prawn paste chicken wings, fu yong egg, hor fun and mui fan. It was quite a while before the food finally arrived. The steamboat soup was tasty and there was quite a few chunky pieces of grouper. The prawn paste chicken wings and kai lan were good, and so was the egg. The sweet and sour pork was a miss though. Overall, we quite enjoyed our dinner.

Not a real fan of chinese fish head steam boat actually. But surprisingly this restaurant serves very tasty steamboat. It is one of the popular restaurants in singapore, local style. The restaurant itself is very bare with only a fan on ground floor and air con on second floor. Besides fish head steamboat, try the fried prawns and fried eggs. One thing i like , they cut the fish head into smaler portions so it is easy to eat and the soup is very tasty ( they put salted fish in it ). 4 people, we paid Sin$70. It's all worth it

With 3 types of fish to select (Pomfret, Red Snapper, or Grouper) for the steamboat, you are spoilt for choice as not many places can offer the same selection. One pot is suffice to feed 3 people, and if you have more people, can always select to add side dishes which are equally tasty. Recommend Sambal Stir Fried Kang Kong, Prawn Roll and Oyster Omelette. And the price is reasonable. Choice of aircon or al fresco dining is also available

was there with the family (3 tables) for a farewell dinner before my sis and her family embarked on their new life in Melbourne.we had the Red Garoupa steamboat, I would say the soup is tasty / sweet and the fish meat is fresh, no fishy smell. a plus point since I don't like fish due to its fishy smell.the prawn paste chicken wings is yummy, a treat for the kids but the adults enjoyed them too. we also had sambal kangkong, 'hay chor', pork chop slices, prawn omelette, salted egg pork ribs. all the dishes has the home cooked kind of taste and so its satisfying especially eaten with family members

Been here many times. Me and my husband love this steamboat very much, and for me this is the best fish head steamboat at singapore. This restaurant is just a simple restaurant, take place at some food court which merge into one restaurant. In the evening it is very crowded. Usually we just order the snapper fish head steamboat, kangkung belacan, and pork prawn balls (forget the name, but more times here the taste quality was reduced so never order this menu again). This time we tried oyster egg, it was delicious.

Went on a weekend and sat on the outside next to the road as they have both indoor and outdoor seating arrangement. Very crowded thus be sure to reach earlier or you will have to wait for seats. We had the fish soup, two type of noodles, veg dish, egg dish, dough fritters at around $50. All were very tasty and the portions are reasonable. Would recommend if you are not the type to shun from sitting near the road and the humidity

Not bad and could be better! The soup has a lot of fish boat from the dried fish. So when give to young children got to be careful. Taste heavier than the other one at Blk 462. Can try.

Arrived later in the evening so was quieter, went for the snapper (recommended by the person serving me) fish head steamboat... was amazing. Great value for money and would definitely come back.
5
it was very tasty soup served in a traditional steamboat. We were recomended boneless fish which was nice. Served with rice, or anything you choose from the menu. You can copy from locals :)

A nice and tasty fish head steamboat. The soup base is rich and sweet to my likely. Fish is fresh and good. Expect long long during peak hours.

It has outdoor and indoor seating arrangements.It can be crowded during meal time so be early probably 6plus in the evening? The wait time for the food to be served is long so you must have patience. Bring some snacks along if you are really hungry.There are plenty of carpark lots available. Alternatively you can take public transport to have a meal here.The key feature is fish steamboat. You can order side dishes such as vegetable, chicken, pork, omelette or toufu.I ordered their special toufu, salted egg chicken and grouper fish steamboat. Do consider to order add ons for the steamboat if you feel the ingredients are not sufficient. Charcoal is placed inside the steamboat, it is pretty traditional.I love to drink the soup in the steamboat. You hardly feel thirsty after drinking the soup. The food is not bad.Worth a visit!

This place just reminds you of what the simple life is. Fresh quality ingredients put through their paces in a umami filled broth thats rich and layered with smoky flavor from the charcoal they use. The place is packed, and rightly so , the food is great, service is alright but the food comes fast and everyone seems to be having a grand time. Its lovely to eat here when theres a breeze too!Naturally the fish head steam boat is the best. Give the cuttlefish Kang kong a try too, together with their juicy prawn paste chicken! I will be back for sure!

Went as a group, tried their famous fish head steamboat. Quite unique experience where the soup is kept piping hot on the table. the restaurant is quite a icon in Singapore been around for long. No frills and no customer service expectations. Food is excellent especially if you are in a large group to try their signature dis

Being to this restaurant before and wanted to try again together with my family. Was there ard 7pm plus and was crowded with people. Thought we had to wait and suffer, who knows the staff direct us to upstairs, which is air-conditioned. Service is okay, staffs busy yet never ignore us. In fact service is very fast too. Although is air-conditioned room, is still better to get a table without air-condition, as it is quite stuffy inside the room. Food is nice, especially the soup base. Fish is fresh, and the balachan kang kong is yummy too. Price wise is reasonable. The restaurant accept credit card payment too, unlike some other old shops, so is very convenient for tourist with not enough local currency or those afraid go without enough cash on hand. Overall experience is good, will definitely go back again

Nan Hwa Chong Fish Head has been around in Singapore since 1927! making it one of the oldest restaurant in Singapore!, The soup base of the steamboat was really amazing as well as the fish used are really fresh as well. The traditional steamboat are all served with charcoal which keep the soup hot throughout.Other than the steamboat one could order some of the signature side-dishes as well such as the prawn paste chicken & salty egg pork rib!A highly recommend restaurant if you're into fish head steamboat

We had their traditional fish head steamboat and it was wonderful. The soup was amazing and I couldn't stop drinking. Fish was fresh. Smell from the burning charcoal was very aromatic. Only downside was the tiny portion of vegetables in the pot....... Worth the visit to try the steamboat. Yummy!!
