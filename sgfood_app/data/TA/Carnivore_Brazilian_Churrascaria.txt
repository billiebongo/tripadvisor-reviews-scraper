Friendly and attentive service in a casual relaxed atmosphere. Good variety of tasty meats. Loved the caramelised pineappple too.

We loved everything there is in the menu! Our personal favorites are the cheesy beef and the fish! It is such a great place to hang out and eat!
Can’t wait to be back!
5
Excellent food and service.
It's typical churrasco and high quality.
Not cheap, but highly recommended.
Seating by pre-booking advised.

We had a wonderful evening .The food was excellent and service is really good.
The staff is very friendly.
Value for money.

My family and I love coming to Carnivore for Christmas Lunches.
The roast meats are so delicious and the service staff are friendly. Our dinning experiences have been great so far. :)

Carnivore is in CHIJMES, close to City Hall MRT. The setting is nice and relaxing, and the buffet spread of salads is great. Then comes the main event - the Meat! Carnivore provides you with round after round of lovely barbecued meats, all delivered to your table. A marvellous experience

The bill included a well deserved service charge but I was very disappointed that when we paid - albeit only 4 dollars over total cost- lady who took our money never returned with any change - I object to the restaurant deciding to add extra tip themselves!!!The food was good overall - some meat delicious and some a little tough
5
It is one of the best restaurants ever visited. Buffet was amazing!!! Meat and fish cuts were delicious plus ➕. Service excellent. Prices logical or below expectations!!! Chefs Very care all guests!! Been there already seven times or more and all times happy plus ➕.

I arrived late on a Thursday evening. All of the other customers were finished with their meals, so I was not sure if I would receive good service. My worries were eliminated as my server kept bringing out more and more meats. Even after I switched my 'sign from yes to no, he continued to stop by to make sure I really didn't want to try the next selection. He only stopped when I told him that I could eat no more. And to my surprise, he stopped by to thank me for my visit as he was leaving for the night.I had no problems with my request to separate food and alcohol onto different bills (need to keep the accountants happy at work!) and I left very satisfied. If my travels bring me back to Singapore, I will visit Carnivore Chijmes again

It was a lovely dining experience - the ambience was perfect for dinner, but ore importantly the food was delicious.The moment we sat down to eat, an array of different meats were brought out one after the other; the selection ranged from chicken to beef to seafood, all of which were delicious. The roastes pineapple was a lovely palate cleanser, and was a great way to start each new round of food!The servers also added to the experience, as they were pleasant and accommodating with our particular requests. Would particularly mention Mr Guan who helped attend to every single of our requests with a big smile and perfect attentiveness!Overall, definitely a place I would recommend to friends and family - the only prerequisite is to make sure you have a large appetite
4
Great dining atmosphere, polite staff. Selection of meat was awesome. Even though it is named carnivore, the restaurant still offers plenty of vegetables and fruits. So for people who are afraid of getting overwhelmed by the copious amount of meat served, fret not.
5
Great place, awesome ambiance. Highly recommended for a fun nights out. The manager was also particularly accommodating. Really great experience!
5
excellent bbq all around, don’t mind bring relatives here next time! Good service and ambiance with friends too over a glass of wine :)
5
Great place for meat lovers. Salad bar was wonderful. Food was great at first after awhile we couldn’t stomach anymore meat. Great atmosphere and ambience.
5
The taste was wonderful
Service was great
The have people with Skewer food of beef chicken pork and going around you select what you need but all of them was with a good taste
And open buffet salads
You shoud try the grilled pineapples
5
We brought our family here for our parents' 45th wedding anniversary and the experience did not disappoint! Our servers were very attentive, the food was delicious, and the manager went above and beyond to make this a special time for all of us. Our server, Ho Cheng Guan, even brought out a special cake for them to share with the number 45 on it to celebrate this impressive milestone. Thank you, staff of Chijmes Carnivore, for making our evening perfect
5
I have been eating at Carnivore for years. My family and I are all big meat lovers. Have always been eating at their outlet at Marina Bay Sands but unfortunately, that outlet closed down.Visited another outlet at CHIJMES. Food was just as good and service was faultless.They have a wide range of meats you can choose from. (Beef, Pork Chicken, Fish, Chicken Heart). Best of all, you can eat as much as you want. I promise you won't leave the place feeling hungry.I would like thank the manager, Guan, and his staff for a great meal and wonderful service
5
Went there to celebrate my partners birthday. Virgin attempt to dine at CHIJMES. I would like to appreciate the level of customer service provided to be by Guan. Really amazing customer service and helped me with my request quickly and professionally. Recommended for any occassions! Kudos, keep up the good job. Will definitely visit again.

My eldest sister's youngest son treated us to this place for his housewarming dinner. This is the first time I ate in such a Brazilian restaurant with my husband. Starters are in buffet style, you got to choose from a variety of salad, noodles, soup and cheese etc. Then the servers go around the table serving the different types of meat, from fish, to chicken, to beef, and then to lamb. There was also the grilled pineapple, which I find quite tasty. The portion of the meat is quite big, and so your stomach got filled up quickly. I think a total of 16 different types of meat were being served. There were also fruits to choose from to end your meal, and a few simple small slices of cake. My elder sister said that they used to serve ice cream too, but now probably due to costs, they cut it out too. This seems to be a very popular restaurant in Singapore, and reservations must always be made in advance
4
This is our first visit to the restaurant to try out their all-you-can-eat buffet..The buffet spread and meat selection are pretty good. There were also grilled pineapples which was one of my favourite dish.Their servers would be slicing the meat off the skewers at each table and they would approach your table only if you flip the card to green at your table. They served you the meat only when you request for it hence they would not disrupt your conversation or your peaceful meal.The servers of meat are extremely friendly and would stop for a joke or two when they slice the meat for us.We had another young server at our table whom was very attentive to us to serve our wine and also extremely helpful to take picture for us. He was waiting on our table and also helping out at the bar counter to concoct drinks.There were condensation problem from the aircon above us hence there were water droplets dripping onto us quite frequently and this young server was totally concern and offered to wipe off the condensation above our table for us. When we requested for a change of table, he was even more than patient to check around and came back to tell us the condensation problem was not better in the other end than our end. Hence we stayed on at our table. We totally appreciated his thoughtfulness and service.The setback of this restaurant was also the slippery floor. We felt the floor was dangerously slippery when we walk to the salad bar and we do see the servers walking strangely too cause there is a serious fear that one would slip and fall. The management should seriously look into improving the air condensation problem as well as the slippery floor to ensure better comfort and ambience to employees as well as customers

Don't go overboard on the salad to start as the varied selection of meat just keeps coming, lovely fresh meat from lamb, beef and chicken. Staff very helpful
4
Great food with great services from the crew. 2 Thumbs up ! Would strongly recommend meat lovers to visit. Reservations required !
4
So much was served.. so many types of meat to try on! It's an interesting experience.. staff were helpful and accommodating and food and salad bar was terrific!
4
We had dinner for S$50. They serve steaks of all kinds. And the chef would go to your table and serve the steak. You can get as much as you want. Everything is delicious too.
4
The variety for kinds of meat are good, the portions are obviosuly great because it's free flow, LOVE the salad bar however the way the meat is cooked could be better.
5
Date Night with my wife and decide to have dinner over at Carnivore Brazilian Churrascaria @ Chimjes, the food was to die for espically the beef rump and sirlion... we will be definately will be back for more.
4
Been to such restaurants a few times, this one is still very good. The meats selection is very good and you can tell the freshness of the meat from the grill appearance and taste. The beef hump and sirloin was superb. The lamb was good too. Overall enjoyed all the grill selection. The salad bar was dull,did not look as fresh but it was ok to get on. The highlight was the grill anyway. Oh yes the grill pineapple was a must to finish it all.
2
We used to like Carnivore at Chijmes a lot and having both been to Brasil (I even used to live there), my husband and I knew we would be getting an authentic experience from the salad bar to the pão de queijo to the caipirinhas. It is supposed to be an entire dining experience, so having just returned to Singapore, we thought we'd check it out for a good meal. Utter disappointment. Let's just say, if anyone was on the fence about whether or not to become a vegetarian, eating here would make up their minds very quickly. The salad bar did not have anything resembling a standard rodizio - no potato salad, no coração de palma, no farofa...basic lettuce, some beans and rice, and random veggies, but none of the signatures. The saddest part was every piece of meat brought to us was completely unseasoned and extremely cooked. For a second my husband even thought they may have been reheating the meat left over from lunch. Even slices of picanha that were slightly pink were rubbery and needed salt. The waiters and staff were all very courteous, but after many trials and failures, we couldn't accept anymore meat. I read reviews about grilled pineapple making the rounds - huh? That never came out and to add insult to injury, the waiter who finally decided to bring out the pão de queijo quickly offered it to us as we were standing up to leave! The one salvation was the caipirinha which was quite good. It's just sad the restaurant seems to have fallen since its glory days years ago. We will be trying Brazil Churrasco on Sixth Avenue for a more authentic experience
5
We have just come from here, and we don't have a churroscaria in perth, and I cannot recommend this place enough! It reminds me of bubba gumps in Bali for those who know it. You have to flip your card for the waiters to bring you your food, and vice versa. Great food, awesome customer service all within chijmes. My only small critique is that when you have your card set to red, the waiters don't pay attention to it and give you food anyway. other than that, I highly recommend
2
Food was too salty, service was slow and rude as I'm a first timer of carnivore they didn't provide a rough guide on how it's gonna be like. Also, most of the food is beef if you are not eating beef, please do not go there. Wasted my 
3
Had dinner with the family. Reasonable variety of meats but they could add on some seafood like squid, prawns or fish. Meat also a little over seasoned.
5
lovely terrace with view of th eold church
great service
seriously good quality meats and a great range
3
It's a great location to chill with friends but it is a tad bit overpriced. The meats were ok, the grilled pineapple was my favourite.
4
As above, and the service is excellent! Food choices were aplenty, especially the appetisers and meat served were aplenty!
3
There are so many meats but I just loved the picanya (beef rump cap). It was the tastiest. Had several rounds of it until I was so full that I just could not continue further and missed out on quite a few of the other meats. Next time perhaps. I also love the cheese bread.
5
For someone who enjoys meat all but meat this is the place to for dinner. As my sons enjoy meat I took them here for dinner but vegetariana don't worry unless you need a four course veg dinner this is OK if you accompany non vegetarian gang. The best part is roasted Pineapple. I ended up eating almost 2 pineapples. The nice thing about serving is there is a kind of signal flip board kept in every table whenever you want something to be served you can turn it on and until then no one bothers you. Once you turn it on you are going to get flooded with roasted meat minute after minute. Meat lovers don't miss!
4
To make the most of your visit here you need to know that you are signing up for an all you can eat meat type deal. If that's what you are looking for, then you are going to have a great time as the quality and variety of the different meat options that keep being a offered is really good and the salad bar provides a wide variety of sides. The bar offers a fairly standard selection and the setting and ambiance is the square add a lot to your experience. The price is fairly high but that is representative for what you get on return. If you are in the mood for a meat feast then I highly recommend it but otherwise I would choose a different option
2
I went there with my parents, wanting to have some good meat and enjoy the place. However it was not as expected, service is very bad, and since the restaurant was almost empty probably they didn't have any fresh dishes, we felt the food was cooked long time ago and taste was not nice
1
Meat - out of the 8 meats offered to us, only 2 were half decent; short rib and rump. Everything else was dry, overcooked and tasted pretty awful. Salad bar - a seriously sorry excuse for a sides and appetizer buffet. Laughable. Everything looked straight out of a 70s swingers party. Despite there being at least 10 tables, the mixed lettuce salad bowl had not been touched. Why? Because right on top for all to see were manky slimy leaves that personally I don't find very inviting. Just disgusting. Best thing on there was the fresh fruit. You peel and cut, how hard is that? At least they managed that well. Don't go thinking you'll get a decent dessert though. Some pink custard looking thing with sprinkles on it. Omg, it looked foul. Didn't bother. Cocktails - took forever to make and arrive and not worth the wait. The mixes were wrong and the caipiroska, caipirinha and lychee mojito all tasted horrible. Service - pretty bloody ordinary. They didn't want to be there. The meat givers were pretty rude, especially one guy who kept splashing sauce and oils on my clothes while serving me. Atmosphere - non existent. Felt like being at a sizzler. For what you pay, it's not worth it. It's pretty cheap so that's saying something. Give this place a miss. Please. Don't do it to yourself
3
The food delivered is ok. The salad buffet is satisfactory and the meats on offer are not too bad. The service delivery is quite efficient but that's where it lacks. The delivery of the meat is presented with a sense of urgency to have it just on to your plate with the utmost efficiency and with very little personal attentiveness. Overall it was Ok for the experience but not in my eyes a calm and pleasurable dining experienc
3
The meat portion is very filling. After the first few servings, one will feel rather full of eating due to the protein.
5
We really enjoyed the meat. Great quality and well cooked meet. Beef, pork, lamb and chicken.
Very good ham and roasted pineapple. The ambience is excellent too.
The place is near to City Hall MRT. Just few mins walk.
4
This is a good getaway from the high rise city life. Our guests enjoyed the atmosphere and appreciated the historical background of CHIJMES. Food was good with interesting salad spread. The beef hump, especially, scored lots of praises.
3
Food is excellent quality particuarly the fish and...jnever mind. gets GELAT reaaaaaaaaaaaaal fast. Staff never smile when you say please or thank you.
1
The salad selection was dull and not very fresh, most of the different salads were finished. The meat selection is quite cheap and the few good meats there are only circulate every 30 minute or so. And each round you risk losing out if you're seated in the end of the meat round... Totally not worth the price of 80 SGD for "all you can eat buffet". We will definitely not be coming back.
4
I have tried Brazilian Barbecue in a different Singapore restaurant which had a much better variety of meat as well as buffet options, but our hotel was nearby so we picked this one. It's not that the food was bad, it was still very tasty, but some of it was unevenly cooked so you don't always get the melt-in-you-mouth consistency
4
We made a booking on e mail for 4 people and sat outside for the good ambiance. The service was good as per the concept of unlimited meat offerings. The meat was done well and although we've tasted better in other countries.. we overall enjoyed the food for sure! Wish they had the batter fried type bananas though... it wasn't on offer the day we went. We would go again if we come to Singapore. It helps that the restaurant is at Chijmes which is one of our favorite places
3
We went there as a 30 plus group. The place is in Chijmes which gives it some immediate attractions.The experience was good but compared to genuine Churrascaria restaurants in Brazil this one paled somewhat.The food was great, the salads and carbs section was a bit spartan but the meat was well cooked and pleasant.The service wasn't ideal, quite slow and inattentive.If you have never had a proper churrascaria in Brazil then you could well be blown away by this place, maybe's I'm just a snob.Good night out. No material complaints
2
We've eaten at other locations of this restaurant and always enjoyed it. We went to this one on a Saturday night and the experience was far from satisfactory. The meats were undercooked to the point of raw, and lacked seasoning. Most of the meats were tasteless. Not what we were expecting as the location in Turf City is truly excellent in service and flavour.We will not return to this location, but we highly recommend some of the other locations from the same chain

Established in October 2004, Carnivore Brazilian Churrascaria is a meat-lover's paradise, offering a veritable meat buffet in the Brazil style churrascaria. With a casual, relaxed atmosphere; friendly, personable service; and tasty South American food served communal dining style, Carnivore Brazilian Churrascaria has grown in popularity, and they now operate 3 outlets islandwide.Ambience at Carnivore Brazilian Churrascaria is relaxed and rustic. The simple, modern, wooden cushioned furniture is in shades of black and brown, contrasting with the simple bare walls and floors. There is minimal decor, but what little there is are homages to Brazil and its culture. Latin American music plays in the background, very apt with its lively salsa beats. The spacious layout and comfortable vibes lend well to long, lingering, communal meals with friends.Service at Carnivore Brazilian Churrascaria is friendly, courteous, and professional. Staff make an effort to go out of their way to accomodate requests, which I like. They display proper attention and care for diners, and have good product knowledge, able to describe the various options in the salad bar or on the menu. Staff also clear empty / dirty plates and tables efficiently. The knife wielding passadors are skilled, introducing each meat, then expertly carving it right in front of guests; with no mess and no splashback from gravy.Food at Carnivore Brazilian Churrascaria is all about Brazil style churrascaria. Begin the buffet at the salad bar, where over 15 different hot and cold dishes (salads, appetizers, soups, staples) await. The passadors will then come around with large skewers of various cuts of meat, in total, 14 different cuts are available, comprising chicken, pork, fish, and the signature, beef. Generally, dishes are executed well, with consistent quality expected of a restaurant. Being a buffet, portions are free-flow. Prices are reasonable too, budget SGD $75 per person for a meal with drinks here
3
We were there for a birthday celebration for party of 9 people. The dinner started as exciting as it was all of first Brazilian Churrasco but after been served a couple of different BBQ meats, we get quite "sick" of the taste as it seems like all the meat is having the same seasonings (which I think they should be different but you can taste the differences after eat so much meat).Side dishes lack of veggie choices, definitely not a place for veggie lover.We all agreed that it is a good experience but will not be going back anytime sooner as it is not a "value for money" kind of dinner
4
We went on a rainy day, the indoors area is quite limited in space, but to our luck the weather cleared so the tables on terrace became available. The side dishes are very tasty and the meat selection excellent. You might want to stop the meat flow at times, because it tends to come at a too fast intervals. Very enjoyable all in al

@TheKuoKnowsThere is something quite special about eating char-broiled food in the open air. And Carnivore at CHIJMES exploits that to great effect.The setting for the restaurant is quite spectacular, too. The venue was, before it was a themed restaurant park, a school for girls called the Convent of the Holy Infant Jesus. Hence the name CHIJMES.The fixed-priced dinner is an inexhaustible supply of meat. So make sure you have a good appetite. There is also Roasted Pineapple, which is sweetness on a skewer.The choice of meats borders on mind-blowing. Apart from the usual selction of chicken and beef and lamb, it was the beef hump that untrigued me. It was surprisingly tender.The plentiful salads on offer are a great complement for the meat selection. And by the end of the meat-fest, the fruit platter is a pleasant and fitting way to end the meal.Well worth a try if you like lots of meat. But do make sure you go with a big appetite to get your money's worth
1
We sat down intent on having a long relaxing meal. Service was ok but probably because the rest of the place was empty.Tried a range of different meats but they were all extremely low quality - tasted weird and mostly not possible to eat without feeling ill.Soft drink was flat.Salad was basicWe decided to cut our loses and leave to have a decent meal elsewhere
3
This is a poor substitute for a real Churrascaria. If you have traveled to Brazil you no doubt have fond memories of an open grill where meats are cooked over a mesquite wood fire, a vast salad bar and the famous cheese bread. Desserts including flan and similar treats made the dining experience terrific.This isn't that at all. The restaurant is slow to show the best cuts and the meat quality was just average. The salad bar is weak. The prices are higher than what should be charged for this dining fare. Two locations I know of and this one was located at Chijmes.You can do better elsewhere
4
Me and my friend was looking for a place to eat and we had walked and searched for quite a bit before we settled for this place. Since I clearly will never be a vegetarian ever in my love, this place was like heaven to me. The service was excellent, the meat was superb. Usually, if you order any meat, you'd need seasoning and maybe a sauce to go with it. Not for me. I ate it straight as it was sliced in front of me. To do the meat justice, if there is such a thing, after the animal has died, and to do the chef justice, no sauce or seasoning is required. The meat all dont need it. The beef was the best. I preferred it over the lamb. As for the chicken, if only it was boneless, it would have been superb. It was such a perfect environment that me and my friend didn't even bother talking. We just ate in silence. My stomach thanks Carnivore, my waistline does not
3
Visited the nearly deserted Chijmes store for lunch last week. Prices are pretty good at $15++ for some meat and a few sides. I opted for the mixed grill selection which was pretty average. Service was efficient. At the price level it's acceptable, but quality of the meat could be better
4
Carnivore @ Chijmes has a value for money $14-90 ++ weekday set lunch consisting of soup of the day and your choice of salad / side / meat / beverage (coffee, tea or ice lemon tea) from quite a number options. There is aircon and alfresco seating. The service was attentive. I would recommend the fresh garden greens / coleslaw for the salad, aglio olio for the side, mixed grill (consisting of beef, pork and chicken) and the freshly brewed coffee (Italian Lavazza). I enjoyed a cool and pleasant lunch, away from the madding crowd though I was in the heart of the city. BTW, if the portion of the meat size for the mixed grill is increased, that would be more satisfying
1
I love the Churrascaria concept, so I've been to many of them, around rhetoric world. And Carnivore is by far the worst I've been too. Did not enjoy it at all. Very cheap. First they bring out SO many variants of cheap meats, sausages, chicken, even fish! When they finally bring out the more expensive meats, they're not nice either, very salty and chewy. Even the salad bar was a big disappointment.If you want a good Brazilian BBQ, look for another place..
4
Chijmes is a set of historic buildings that used to be a monastery complete with chapel and convent quarters. Now there are many restaurants and bars within the complex which give out an amazing vibe and atmosphere. We met up with friends at Carnivore. The meat selection was ok, but nothing too extensive. I would have assumed the meat to be marinated especially after having eaten at Argentinian steak house, but it wasn't! The salad bar was extensive and well stocked. I've given this a good rating because the ambiance and atmosphere makes this place a must to visit.
4
Good BBQ Meat by Carnivore Brazilian which they are famous for. There are wide variety of BBQ and meats to choose from.
4
Worth the visit not only for the food but for the atmosphere. Nice staff and caipirinha is very good
4
If you are into beef, you can put yourself into meat coma. The all you want to eat sometimes is less then all you can eat. Service is good and they make you feel welcome.
4
Who doesn't love a good Churrascaria? The meats are well seasoned and in terms of selection pretty wide. I always opt to go there 7/10 times because the locations are more central and the food is pretty comparable with other competitors. The salad bar is quite good too, better than the other Churrascaria I've been to in 6th avenue.The only things that could be improved which I don't like on the menu were the fish and the chicken heart. Firstly, the fish I had at the MBS branch was old - (NOTE: but NOT "bad" or anything). We feedbacked to the manager and he apologetically gave us lemon to squeeze on top so it didn't taste so stale. His response to our complaint was prompt and effective, and the service was generally very good. Secondly, the chicken hearts were not done to the point where they were juicy, tasty, and slightly crunchy - the texture was rather powdery and slightly sinewy. The chicken hearts at Brazil (6th avenue) are waaaaay better. The caprinhas we had were also so-so. Aside from that, definitely a place to go for your meat coma
2
Standard dropped! Meat quality poor! Service so-so. Not very hygiene for the buffet spread as can see houseflies flying around
4
Set in the majestic Chijmes, it's a great place for dining with friends and family alike. Starting off with the generous salad buffet, it's then a smorgasbord of different meats and sausages. And just when you think you've tasted all they have to offer, there's always another skewer that comes along and surprises even more.Thoroughly enjoyed myself there, and would go again soon when I am back in the city
4
Service is good, food is acceptable but the atmosphere is wonderful. Chimes is a great location for eating and entertaining clients and friends. Selections of meats is good and well prepared. Servers are very good to keep your beverage topped off or providing a new beer when necessary. Prices are in line with what you would expect in Singapore. Good value
2
I reserved a room for 6 people and we were seated outside, next to the smoking area. We requested another table and were seated in the air conditioning. The salad bar was OK but the majority of the meats that we were served were not good. The pork ribs were not good and the brisket was so greasy that we could not eat it. Even the best cuts of meat were far below expectations for a restaurant that charges this much. The concept is good but the quality needs to be improved. I will not go back
4
This is really an "all you can eat" but with quality food.The price isn't that cheap (normally with a beer you can reach 75$ all inclusive) but the quantity and quality is very good in a very nice ambience. Service is always there but without being of disturbance while chatting with your friends. A waste buffet is helping you starting the journey. On the past you where ha ing a button (green and red) to control the food flow, now there is a turning plate, but the meaning is always the same.Bottom line a good experience where on need to fill a desperately empty stomach. If it is only for a standard appetite, may be it is too costly
3
My sister in law's birthday celebrating with family of 13. Food was below average as the varieties for non keat eaters limited . The meats were presented flamboyantly by the waiters in skewers however some were undercooked . Ambience was nice as it's located in lovely Chijmes
3
The waiters literary passby us even when my table call for service maybe partly due to the place we sat. We sat at the indoor corner. But it was all good after requesting managers help.
4
I liked this kind of restaurant in Brazil, this Singaporean one is really good....recommended for meat lovers
3
Not really up to standard. Very standard meat in general over cooked. Service not so fantastic, I think they are complacent because of the location which will attract customers anyway. Will not go back
4
Located nearby rafles hotel. very easy to reach. Restaurant also offer simple italian dishes.
taste good, with served meat like satay. The restaurant also has outside table for the smookers and guest in a group
2
if you want picanha you have to ask for it! they want to fill you up with sausages, chicken etc. quality below standard! selection at buffet very limited! hard garlic bread! service not very fast but ok! 49sgd++ is ok
2
Meat factory, meat is average, side dishes are standard and I would no go back, sorry! There are too many restaurants like this, price quality is not good!!
2
You arrive at this restaurant and the staff hurry you to a table briefly explain in very poor English how the menu works...then hurry you to get salad !!! Meat is brought around on huge skewers ...a lot of the meat is basic such as sausage and chicken thigh. There is some steak and beef but this is padded out by cheap cuts. Overall the whole meal feels rushed and basi
4
Had an amazing meal, with meat galore, they served Beef, Lamb,Pork, Chicken, Sausage, then fish, smoked meat, and offal that they described as spare parts and more so much, I am sure we both over indulged, in fact I amNot going to touch anything meat for at least a week, and it kept coming.Not for Vegan - Veggies or the faint hearted
5
This is not our first trip to a Carnivores and again we were not disappointed. Despite it being early in the night the meats were ready and just keep coming. Plenty of food, and cooked perfectly, although people who don't like rare meat might want to avoid some of the cuts. Service is fast and efficient. Great place to eat, but prepare yourself but not eating a big lunch - it's worth it
2
Had the fixed menu. At 100 bucks its no way worth the cash for some pork sausage and chicken. Not much beef or lamb on the go. Many many better places around for this money. Give it a miss. Wont be going back
5
Deffinately for carnivores all meat meat and meat with pineapple at the end pf the course
Its a fantastic buffet restaurant. Recommended for carnivores indeed
4
Love the ambiance, nice & comfortable outlet in Chijmes.. Opt for the outdoor seating where it's spacious and airy.. Nice selection of sides when one gets sick of having too much meat.. :) service was prompt and frequent. Enjoyed it.
1
We have come there several times during the past two months - probably 5 times. It has been fine everytime. However, today was so bad, that we may not go there ever again. We could not get the normal menu at app SGD 50, but only the special Valentine's Day menu at SGD 80. The mark up of SGD 30 was for a drink and a desert. The drink was some sweet standard drink and the desert was something uneatable in a similar drink glass. Furthermore there was no free tap water, but only SGD 8 expensive bottle water. So sad that they spoil an evening that way. Food was reasonable, but the impression of that was probably also influenced by the overall impression
4
Carnivore's promises a lot, and really delivers. The cuts of meat were wonderfully cooked, flavoursome and plentiful. Even the salad buffet had an wide choice of delicious condiments. The atmosphere was excellent and staff were attentive. The all inclusive price is also quite reasonable, especially for the quality of the food. A great restaurant for friends and family.

Bring an empty stomach and time when you come here. You need time to try the simply yummy meats on skewers. It was fun for my teenagers to experience the different types of meats and sample the wide range at the salad bar - pasta, rice, vegetables, fruits and cheesecake. the grilled pineapple is really sweet and goes well with the meats. there was beef, lamb, chicken, pork and even fish. All nicely done. the service staff are pretty attentive and our water glasses were filled up without us having to ask them - that is quite uncommon. The ambience is good with outdoor seating and music

One particular server kept running out before he got to us, and another ignored us completely! Meats were very fatty and to be honest, not that great in taste. Shame. Was looking forward to this.Almost forgot... The music seems to be run by someone on (free with ads) Spotify who kept playing Lionel Ritchie's on repeat! The same song. Hahah

Suite Good Brazilian Carnivore restaurant. Serve quite good tender Brazilian tender meat, but not as good as for 3 years back. Not the same as similar restaurants in Brazil, but you get the taste and the feeling. Do not reject the grilled Pineapple served between the meat

Had business dinner at this restaurant in Nov 2015. You get to have different kinds of meat from chicken, lamb, beef to pork, served by the walking chef peal the meat in front of you, which was quite interesting. There are also a small corner of buffet spread with salad, soup, cooked food and sweet, but not appealing. Drinks are pricey

Servers barely paid attention to our table, even though we were the first table of the row, they always served the meat first to the second table and then returning to us, which only gave us the worst pieces of meat. The buffet was terrible, not fresh. Toobad to waste the location on such a place.

Some of the staff not accommodating.
Food was really delicious, worth going next time . Price is ok .

One thing Brazilian Churrascarias are know for is lots of good food, the this one won't disappoint you!! Great atmosphere inside Chimes. Food was brought out quickly. Could be a bit more variety of the meats, but what was served was very good.

This is a great, reliable, comfortable restaurant in a cool location.
We had the Tower Tiger, and the Adult Dinner. Not cheap but worth the price for the great selection of meats and the friendly, efficient service.

The staff were friendly but not attentive. Took a lot of time getting their attention and on top of that, about 10mins just for ice water and getting the bill. Meat were quite salty and salad-bar was so-so. Nevertheless, they have huge variety of meat. Booked through Chope and received confirmation email, but when I reached there, my name was not in the list.

One has an expectation level if you have dined at a similar concept before & having eaten at Brazilian "eat as much as you want" all over the world my expectations were high. Unfortunately my expectations were not met. This was a business dinner at 20.30 on a Tuesday evening to set the scene. The location is nice in a courtyard of the Chijmes mall and the restaurant is well presented. The aperitif was also served quickly. The wine list was very limited and our first choice was not available, because of the price of a bottle of good quality wine in Singapore I guess there is not much demand and therefore not a lot of experience from the waiters. My first disappointment was the lack of a quality salad buffet; previous visits to other Brazilian restaurants have meant me having to restrain myself from over-indulging on the salad starter as the choice/quality was so good - no problem here as I found it a difficulty to fill a small plate. When we switched to the non-stop meat service I was extremely disappointed. Service was very slow, the choice was not good and to be honest you should be offered some form of carbs to go with he meat, this is the case in other Brazilian buffets. This is also a sensible marketing strategy as if people eat a lot of low cost carbs then they tend to eat less of the high cost meat! They practically stopped serving us even though our indicator showed green and it was only when we ordered another bottle of wine, shock horror, that more food was brought. If Carnivore is your first visit to a Brazilian buffet then you most probably would think it was great, if you have visited others then maybe you will not be so impressed

This was a place that I frequented a lot! I just couldn't get enough of the food and of course the wonderful friendly servers they had there. If you are into a lot of meat I would recommend coming here. It's perfect for a good night out and even works for corporate functions.

Sorry, I didnt take photos during dinner here cause my hands were so full eating those lovely slabs of meat they were serving. We started off with an aqua panna bottle and then they served this brazilian drink, I dont know what that's called. We then followed it up with some salad available inside the restaurant on a buffet table. I had corn and potatoes and then here came the meats. One by one, the waiters went to our table offering and serving different types of meats. I think I had around 7-8 diff types of meat. I liked the quality and the taste, not too overwhelming. My friend, a Norwegian, really loved the fish, as I did. It was just heaven. It was unlimited meat but after the first round, we gave up. We didnt want to take more than we could.

Meat of all sorts, as much as you can eat....They serve you as long as you don't turn them down !Plus buffet of salads, vegetables, and deserts.Great atmosphere in a redesigned church/monastery with several other restaurants and bars, sitting outside in the courtyard.In the middle of the city, great experienc

The place is very nice, side of the church and food is a authentic Brazilian food, the meat is a show very good. If you love the good meat don't doubt to go there. And the grillers very friendly. The bad part is the price, I payed almost 60$ for the buffer without drink but is ok for a weekend.

You should really go there if you are a meat lover. If not, I would not recommend going there. Plenty of variety (meat), decent salad bar. Staff was really friendly and attentative.

Came here for to try the set lunch today. You get to choose 3 components: a salad, a side dish and a meat dish for $8.90++ and then pay extra if you want a soup or a water. We opted for both soup and water so the total price for 2 ended up being about $27 all in. No complaints about the price but the quality isn't really there. The salad was really quite uninspiring and the mashed potato was too salty. The beef also wasn't great. Overall we weren't satisfied: there are certainly better lunch deals to try in Marina Square

Went here already 2-3 times and when it comes to quantity the Rodizio style will surely satisfy you. Different kinds of meats of beef, pork, lamb and waiters will not stop serving you. The side buffet lacks to my opinion on variety and will just fill you up with texas beans and other typical sides but nothing really spectacular. Seating outsides within Chimes is always nice but service is just so so- frankly have eaten Rodizio already much better in other places.

The reservation process was a bit trying..... getting the lady at the other end to understand a name that had just 4 letters and a standard Singapore mobile number was quite harrowing. However, when we landed up it was reassuring to see that the booking had been correctly done - got to give credit where it is due.The staff are friendly like most places in SIngapore. However, they did appear to be under some pressure. Possibly because the restaurant was almost full and there was a large group (20+) in one table. It did seem though that they were understaffed - not sure if it was because of absenteeism or general short recruitment. The setting is of course very nice. We sat outdoors as I think everyone should.The food was good. The meats were very nicely cooked and especially the chicken. The beef was soft and tender. However, the variety of meat on offer was poor. We just had about 6 or 7 different types. I have been to Chrrascarias (not in SIngapore but in South and Central America) where the meat variety is mind boggling and the salad spread is a meal initself. That was certainly not the case here. Overall for the sort of money that is charged ($49++) the value is just not there on the table. Not sure if there was something wrong that day or this is the usual. For 3 people with 3 drinks (2 beers and a Coke) we spent $200

Went with a work group. Good vegetarian range as well as the meat. Meat was ok and cooked nicely but that's all there was to it. Needs some theatre to make it more interesting. If you haven't had a beer tower before and there are a few of you it is worthwhile.

This restaurant works like the typical Brazilan Churrascaria. There is no menu, just a single price meat festival option. You start by selecting salads and vegetables from a reasonably stocked buffet and as soon as you sit down, waiters will come around your table to slice meat from long skewers of tenderloin, pork meat, chicken breast, lamb, sausages and various other bits and pieces of meat. They continue to serve you meat until you cannot take it any longer and turn around a token from the green to the red side to indicate you have had enough. The various types of meat were all delicious. The tenderloin was juicy and tasty and the chicken wrapped in bacon was also delicious. At S$57 ( tax and service included), it isn't cheap for Asian standards but the quality and amount of meat you are served make it well worth it. A nice and different experience which our 2 teenagers also really liked. The outdoor seating in the inner courtyard of Chijmes is really pleasant and the service was excellent. Strongly recommended

The meat is good there. There are some really juicy options. The location and setting are very good as well. We got there at about 6.45 pm and were served very quickly, with waiters coming to us every few minutes. However, after the restaurant was filled with people, we had to wait much longer to be offered meat

We used to go to the churrascaria on 6th avenue, however this has long since replaced it as our favourite churrascaria in Singapore. Typically it has the all you can eat option, and the salad bar is fresh. Staff are pleasant and explain the stop and go signs next to your plate for newbies. I recommend the hump! It melts in your mouth! The ham and the pineapple are also fabulous!
