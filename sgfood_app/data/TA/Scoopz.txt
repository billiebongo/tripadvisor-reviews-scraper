I frequent the outlet at Blk 163 Ang Mo Kio Ave 4, a secluded tranquil environment with great savory durian ice cream. The staff is friendly, Wifi were provided when requested. A great chill-out place for work on a non-busy hour.

Good choice, lovely flavours, and reasonable prices too. Always nice to have a little treat from time to time.
Just. GO. THERE. Your taste buds will thank you.

Tried avocado, strawberry cheesecake and cookies & cream. Tasted pretty average. Small sitting area; not suitable for big group. Even for my family of 4, we weren't able to sit comfortably.

Fresh ice cream. Durian is a must-try!

Delicious, especially the jackfruit one. Yums. And very decently priced at $2.90 per scoop or $4.50 for 2 scoops. When other ice cream places are selling almost $4 per scoop

Local fruit flavours D24 durian, jackfruit, soursop and mango are my favourites.

Located on Level 3, outside Giant Hypermarket; next to the escalator.Clean and tidy shop with helpful, cheerful and friendly middle age assistant. 1 scoop @ $3.20, 2 scoops @ $5.50 & 3 scoops @ $7.20.My favourites are Belgian Chocolate, Jackfruit, Earl Grey, Durian. Tasty ice cream. Love to have a scoop whenever am there

Of all the ice cream places that I have tried, Scoopz remains my favorite. I have to admit though that I am a durian fan and so have always tried just the durian flavor. It has bits of durian flesh and is not too sweet. To me it tastes better than other brands which are too creamy and taste artificial to me. My children have also tried the matcha flavor and the mint chocolate chip. Both of which were nice. I also think the price is right at S$3.50 a scoop (no extra charge for the cone).

For a mere $2.50 per scoop, Scoopz is scooping out the best local flavours in town. My personal fave is the chempaka which has bits of fruits in it. My wife and friends like the durian which I am sure must be very good too since they all swear by it
