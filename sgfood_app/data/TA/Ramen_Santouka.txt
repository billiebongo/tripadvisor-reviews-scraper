Without doubt the best Ramen in Singapore I have tried them all Santouka wins by a country mile. Just the best flavours and side dishes also outstanding .

One of best ramen in town. The place isnt big but quit comfortable. Ramen taste really good with the pork. Service is good. Must try!

Always order the ajise ramen which is a nice hearty flavor. The rice is a nice bonus. Pity that they no longer offer the tea

Came here for dinner with friends. The dinner sets are around SGD25++. The portion is pretty generous. The ramen and gyoza here are nice. The view is nice as well.

I ordered the pork cheek ramen (which was recommended) and I absolutely enjoyed it! The meat was well marinated and went well with the noodles and broth. One of the best ramen meals I've had, coupled with really quick service!

I went straight for the pork cheek special and I guess cheeks are expensive but I don't see how they have any better taste or texture than fine roast pork slices, yet they get the price up to $25 or more. The pork and veges were served on a side dish. After a bit of fiddling around, I decided dumping the whole plate in the bowl was best (you also get some kimchi that can jazz it up a bit). The broth had a great flavour, even if it was a light and delicate shio that's not my favourite. The noodles were very soft and more like packet ramen than I've seen elsewhere. Definitely more suited for people who don't like strong rich ramen

Can’t help returning here - its broth is consistently thick & flavourful. Quality of “char siew” that comes with standard bowl of ramen is good, tender and not the typically thin slice. But the star is certainly its iberico pork cheeks, which is well worth its premium price. The noodles weren’t fantastic, in fact, reminds more of instant noodles quality. For the metal tongues, “Spicy” counts for nothing here

Santouka serves the most delicious ramen I've ever tried. Since they use pork broth, it taste so much better. If you are here, try the pork cheek as well. So yummy, melt in your mouth. I always visit Santouka ramen when I am at Singapore.The price is a bit more expensive compared to other ramen, but with such a great flavour your money is not wasted. Supeerrrr good!

To have a bowl of ramen in Singapore, is easy stuff. Numerous restaurants bearing the name of famous Japan ramen main store have been landing in SG especially inside the mall in the city.Santouka Ramen regardless textures of noodles, it's soup, chai Siew and gyoza - has captured my tummy. The ramen could even contain the lukewarm of its soup, thumbs up

I arrived for dinner at 9pm so there was no queue, indeed i was the last invoming patron. Ordered a set that had ramen with salmon rice. The ramen is good and on hindsight, should have just ordered the noodles only. The salmon rice was cooked salmon flakes and look like baby foodService is very friendly, the 2 waiters are naturally earnest i thin

Great soup base. personally preferred the miso soup base. the pork cheek is soft n worth trying.
definitely good ramen at a reasonable price!
good to patronise during late afternoon to avoid queuing.

This ramen restaurant came highly recommended by a friend. Great soup base and char siew, although the noodles were a bit on the thin side for my liking. But great ramen at a reasonable price!

If you go to Santouka, get the Pork cheek ramen. It will change your life. This is more expensive than your hawker stalls that you can find throughout Singapore, but it is fully worth it.

Like the Pork cheeks though it's lined with visible fat at the top. The soup was tasty too. If the ramen quality in particular the texture could be improved (i.e. Not turned soggy) so soon, it would be 5 stars.

I gotta admit, I've always come back because of their promos. If it's not Groupon, it's JPassport. Yesterday, we got a free side salad simply for liking their Facebook page. We were looking around the restaurant and they were even advertising 1-for-1 promos, specially for staff working in the building. While this is good for consumers, i hope it's sustainable. And the food? Yummy

1) Shio Ramen2)Aburi Toroniku Pao (Melting Pork Cheek Meat Pao with Teriyaki Sauce)The above mentioned are the must try for first time visitors to Santouka. I got addicted to the pao, and never fail to order it whenever I visit Santouka.Not forgetting that the staffs are all very friendly and attentive. I personally feel its the best ramen I can find in Singapore

Voted #1 by many, still you need to try for yourself to understand what is the fuss. Kurobuta Cheek is a rare commodity as there are only 2 cheeks for every black pig. If any cheaper, have to suspect if it is Kurobuta. Besides Pork Cheeks, their Tonkatsu uses the same Kurobuta and is available as a side dish. If looking for a filling meal, try Awase where once the ramen is emptied, pour in the rice to make a good broth porridge

Normally I'm a regular customer at the Cuppage Terrace. Happy with the same menu every time I went as well as the service. Yesterday was the first time visit this branch in The Central. Pork Cheeks Ramen : Taste Yummy but I was sat there at the counter for awhile till get served. Soup was cold. Pork Cheeks was also cold. Gyoza a little too burn for my liking. Shortage of staff here made inattentive service. This branch definitely have a better ambience than another coz of river view. But I don't think I will ever come back here again though. I preferred my food hot.

We have been here several times and each time we were not disappointed. You must try the pork cheeks - so tender and delicious. Apparently it is from Iberico pork which explains why it is so tender. For the Ramen - the medium serving is just nice. Try the Kara Miso soup option with the ramen. It has got a spicy kick better than the others. One of our favorite ramen places in Singapore.

This place, called The Central location is in Clark Quay. Their Ramen is the best I've ever had, anywhere. Be sure to get the Toroniku as a side dish, which can be shared. Service is fast and friendly. The place is a little hard to find, but worth looking for.

Been here several times and their tasty ramen keeps us coming back. Pork cheek is a must-try and their home-made gyoza is good too. Will definitely recommend!

The ramen is good. Try the pork cheeks especially. Juicy and really good.
Unfortunately I doubt I will see you there, because I've not seen a glass so dirty in years.
There's built up gunk on the inside. See attached photo.
Enjoy!

This ramen shop is highly rated, and is touted to “strictly maintains the exact same cooking standards in all its restaurants around the world”. My close pal specially recommended me to this Ramen place for lunch. It is easily located at L2 of Central (Clark Quay Mall) behind Rendezvous Cafe. A short 10 mins wait and we were seated.Restaurant setting is simple and seats a little more than 25 pax probably. Overall ambience is not too pleasing, the seats are too closed with minimum privacy. We can literally hear neighbouring conversations, make worst with a rather boisterous crowd. Only a few window seats have a wonderful view to boost, able to see the riversideMy partner ordered the Miso Ramen set which comes with karaage you can dip with special mayo sauce. While I ordered the Shio Ramen set that comes with small bowl of curry rice (taste a bit sweet though..)! The ramen noodles has good springy texture while pork is soft not too fatty. Noted that ramen here does not come with the egg ( a minus) while the toppings are normal. The ramen noodles are thin, cooked well and complimented by the pork tonkotsu broth which was just rightly flavoured - is tasty, not a tad saltish. Good to slurp through.. The portions are not generous compared to the price we paid. Less than $40 for 2 set lunch meal; reasonable but not compelling… However one can have alternative and fairly decent ramen in the area for less, no attractive ‘pull factor’ Ramen is quite a fave for me. While I frequently tried authentic versions while in Japan with the likes of Hakata IKKOUSH, Ippudo and Baikohken, Ramen Santouka personally not considered the best, but still commendable

This ramen shop is highly rated online and did come and try it. Some say is one of the best. I order shio ramen but I did find it to be average compare to the price. a little higher side. hmm.. it does not have the pull factor to attract me come back, because there are also quite a lot ramen shop at the central.Overall a decent lunc

Yup as the title hints, slurp your way through to Ramen Santouka. This was another eatery I wanted to sample on my last visit to Singapore. What a delight it is. The location is surrounded by other artists but my focus was ramen that evening.The menu again us simple, just ramen of many sorts and you choose your base then add your toppings. I decided upon their hard boiled marinated egg, spring onions and sweet corn.And a side of pork Gyoza which came highly recommended.The ramen noodles were cooked to perfection complimented by the pork broth which was just rightly flavoured.The meal was just the right amount after a day of sight seeing

We were here a couple of months ago. Had to fight with them to let my lady's guide dog in. Finally relented. We went back today but were told very rudely to leave the guide dog outside the premise, insisted they have change their policy and do not want us to patronize them again. A certain chief waitress name Annie and the Japanese shop manager were the ones who threw us out.I did not know paying customers are treated this way in Japa

I have always been coming to Santouka for their shio ramen and pork cheeks. The former has the best tasting soup from among all the ramen places I've been to in town, while the pork cheeks simply IS the best. It is a must try when you come.The price might seem a little pricey but you pay top dollar for a satisfying meal, authentic experience and cheerful service

It took awhile to find this place after my friend's rave recommendation last year. It's on the second floor of Clarke Quay Central, behind Rendezvous, a little nook of porcine, noodle goodness. The pork belly ramen was absolutely delicious and paired well with a cold Tiger beer. My only regret is that I didn't get the pork cheek ramen because the sticker shock alone made me wary. That being said, next time when I'm not on a budget, I'll get it without a moment's hesitation.

This place serves up pretty decent ramen, but after a $50 lunch (for two) recently, I had to wonder if it is THAT good. Their spicy miso broth is very good, spiced just right, and they also have a decent iberico ham version. But everything is charged extra, including boiled eggs - if you want them. The gyozas are good. But you can have fairly decent ramen in the Central@Clarke Quay mall for much less

While Santouka serves up decent ramen, it is quite overpriced for what it is. Its prices are at a huge premium to similar ramen restaurants in the same Central mall. While the spicy miso ramen is particularly good, everything - including boiled eggs - are charged extra. They also have iberico ham as one of the options. The gyoza are particularly good. A ramen lunch for two can easily set you back $0
