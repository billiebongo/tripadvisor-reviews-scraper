Atmosphere is great and Ashino san himself served a great sushi at the bar. Rice was good and kept it under nice temperature, all fishes were fresh and tasty.

First time I had aged-sushi. One of my top 3 favorite Sushi restaurant in Spore now. I like the taste of the fish but wish the sushi rice can be better... I think they deserve at least a one star Michelin

Went there to celebrate my friend's birthday . Though I heard many good things about this restaurant but it doesn't impress me that much as there are much better omakase restaurants out there. Thought not all sushi do impress me but some of the aged sushi are really worthy mentioned such as the aged prawn ones . In terms of variety , i felt that they lack the creativity in taste & presentation but if u want to good aged/cured sushi , this is the place

Tried many such Japanese Omakase restaurants, this is one of the worst one. First time here to try and heard many good things about this place. We were placed at a room for 4 at the extreme right where you don't even see the Chef in front of you even you are on the counter seat. Chef walk in and out to serve their food on their hand ..! Is ok but not too many times.. the menu is expensive and I don't think is worth the $350. The sushi rice is cold and the most of the raw sashimi has been aged most of the time. Tasted a bit of fake with too much seasoning . The server is not even friendly enough and sometime walk to us to ask us lower down our conversation volume! Gosh, my first time ever to have waitress in the high end restaurant to tell me as such! You can pay similar price at Ginza shchi itchi as Marriott hotel, Scott road to get much higher sushi quality. Chef is trying hard but I don't think it worth the money and I won't come back here again..

Went there to celebrate my birthday with my friends, and I had the best sushi meal. It was my 2nd time eating aged / cured sushi. I have to say, I am impressed with the taste and texture. It was not cheap, but it was worth it. Their miso soup was the best miso soup I've ever had!! It was packed with umami.There's only one sushi chef, and that is chef Ashino-san, the owner. Everything was prepped on site, in front of us. There were 8 people sitting at the counter waiting for the chef to serve that day.. So, it took him some time to serve all of us. But it did not bother me, as I love to see chef in action.I would really want to revisit this sushiya, if I have the budget to splurge on sushi again in Singapore

Being sushi fanatics, my husband and I went twice for sushi omakase and was wowed by the variety and quality of sushi served. However on both occasions, the price tag was >$1k.. talk about hole in the pocket but it was a pleasant gastronomic experience :

Edomae sushi - aged fish on vinegared rice. The clever aging makes the fish exquisitely flavourful. At dinner, the main difference between the sushi omakase and the omakase is the number of cooked dishes - mostly delicious. The 'wow' dish is not as unique as Waku Ghin or KiSho, but still a very satisfying experience. Definitely belongs to the exclusive circle of top sushi restaurants in Singapore. Surprising it doesn't even figure in the Michelin guide, although it's certainly better and more pleasant than 2-star Shoukou-nah

Chef Ashino San serves an exquisite sushi meal with amazing skill. His specialty is aged fish between 10-25 days which enriches the taste. Meal for lunch is $125 sgd ++ for the entry level and rises to $200 sgd ++ for Omakase. Prices nearly double for dinner. An excellent place and one of our favourites . Highly recommend his place for a sushi snob

It's tucked away and very small and simple, but the food is excellent. You sit around the chefs table and nearly all the food is prepared in front of you and served fresh on the wooden counter or direct from his hand! I believe there are 2 set menus to choose from and the food comes in a set order. A lot is fish based and super fresh. It's not cheap but is a totally authentic Japanese experience and in my view top notch

There are several very up market Japanese restaurants in Singapore and Ashino at Chijmes is one of them. I've been to 4 others. I will never go back.I made a reservation though wasn't greeted when I arrived, nor was the place set for my reservation. After standing in the doorway for several minutes the chef finally asked us to sit. After we ordered, the chef attempted to take away the sake menu 3 times even though I told him I wasn't done with it. I said in Japanese "please wait" though he still looked annoyed.Even though the other ladies were given a basket for their handbags we were not. There were only 4 other people in the restaurant on a Friday. The chef scolded us for not eating our sushi fast enough saying, "You must eat it when I give it to you." Then he started forcing us to take the sushi right from his hands instead of him placing it down on the board so we could pick it up with our chopsticks. I refused so he skipped me for the service for several minutes.I found the service very rude. For a Japanese restaurant I found it horrible. I lived in Japan and no sushi chef would have ever gotten away with speaking to his customers like that
