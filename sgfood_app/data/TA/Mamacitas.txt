The food is awesome. Try the burrito. I love going there. The only chicken rice in town I love to eat

Food is great, service nice and in lau pa sat with many other little shops. The food jumps out because it's different from all the Asian possibilities. Especially the burrito with cheese and egg is a great meal.

If you want to taste some costa Rican food go to this place! The dish sizes were big (great) and the prices were great! Try the chilero (chilli sauce) for some extra costa Rican taste. It would have been great if they had drinks as well.

i am one of the few costa ricans living in singapore. imagine my excitement when i bumped into this place one day. but upon looking at their menu its more of a mexican restaurant.... where are the platanos and ceviche? and really? burritos and tacos?are these costa rican? the restaurant may be tasty and all but in reality its a Mexican in a Costa Rican costume

The idea of a Costa Rican place in the middle of a Singapore food centre is brilliant. The food is fresh and full of flavour at really good prices. My only suggestion, which would definitely entice me to go more often, is that it is often drowning in oil. I even went for a salad recently thinking that may help - but the sugar filled chilly sauce and oil from the chicken still left my salad floating in a not so appetizing bowl.At the moment, I'll keep it as the place to go after a few beers
