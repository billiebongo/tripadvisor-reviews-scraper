Hidden in china town this little gem offers a perfect selection of salad bowls and vegan burgers with the tastiest fresh fruit smoothies. Really good price as well.

Newly converted to vegan and places like this make me happy I did. Macha latte and hot curry w/ peanut butter brownie, and I'm in my happy place! Coming back tomorrow!

We got caught in rain after visiting the Tooth Relic Buddha Temple so we just entered the place to have a coffee until the rain stops. It proved a very nice place with great coffee and delicious snacks. Very friendly and polite staff as well

Agree with all the positive feedback here about the food - great selection, creative fushion, decent portions. Highly recommend the Vegan All Day Breakfast - good for 1 hungry person, or shareable between 2 with other smaller sides.Owner Zanna & staff are friendly and casual without attitude (unlike some other veggie cafes), would make polite efforts to check on our dining experience. Little things like this do make a difference, so thank you!Suggestion: maybe consider doing something about the interior decor, as well as how the cafe looks from the street - it has wonderful frontage onto South Bridge Rd, near a pedestrian crossing, so as to maximise the visual impact. Before I was brought there by a friend, I walked past it numerous times, and either did not notice it, or did not feel I could walk in for a cuppa tea and slice of vegan cake (as the somewhat hidden entrance was on the side!). Something to think about - will definitely increase your visibility and foot traffic

I only eat Jain food and this place had so many options for jain delicious healthy food!! I had about 2-3 meals there during my stay in Singapore. The Buddha bowl and the Manja Ninja salad was super delicious. The Banana chocolate cake was yum too!

I ordered the make-your-own salad, with mango dressing and it was super delicious! I also ordered the mixed juice which was so fresh. Only thing is that they put lots of ice in it, so it was a bit too icy for my preference.Ps. I'm loving their vegan bakes too! Ordered their vegan banana cake - so divine! :

We went here in a recommendation of a Friend and were really happy with the selection and price of the food on offer. Vegan, vegetarian and special diet people will find this place easy to eat a delectable fill. Great chips, and fresh juice drinks on offer.Atmosphere is relaxed with plenty of staff to assist with choices and orders. Baked goods at the front looked good but we ate too much to get to deserts. This might well be the next visit.

We decided to go out of our way to visit Well Dressed Salad Bar due to the delicious looking photos they post online- on Instagram and Facebook. Sadly we were met with a dingy and sticky corner "cafe" and hardly any choice of cakes whatsoever. We visited around 2PM and ended up taking away because the seats were uncomfortable and just didn't have a welcoming atmosphere. We ordered the matcha green tea cake and the blueberry lemon curd cake and ate them elsewhere. I did ask the server for freshly baked slices and she insisted they were.. Although to be honest I didn't believe her from the look of the old seran wrapping and then afterwards, the taste. The matcha cake was so incredibly dry and tasteless. It was definitely day-old but even fresh I can't imagine it would be moist at all. The blueberry lemon was a little better- moist at least- but tasteless apart from the 1mm topping. It also tasted suspiciously old. I would suggest #1 store the cakes properly so they don't get old tasting quicker, and offer the freshest pieces first. Bake on the day and even twice per day if possible. Don't advertise what you don't sell! The only other choices looked incredibly dire and old- matcha mini "bundt" cakes, choc muffin (which was hidden) and 1 other choice I can't remember but it didn't look or sound appealing. The cost isn't worth the value in my opinion. Very small slices and as I mentioned not freshly made. I can't comment on any other food or drinks but the choices looked quite good. I wouldn't eat cake here again unless perhaps the chef/recipe changes but the salads look quite good. Another note- clean the cake window so that people can actually see the cakes!! It was almost opaque the other day so I had to ask the server to show me them.

Was really happy to find this place near my hostel. Staff greeted me & directed me to a table. Was hard to decide what to eat as it all looked great.Ended up with a wrap & vegan chocolate & pretzel slice. Was delicious! Will definitely be going back

Went here for lunch not so long ago with some vegan friends of mine. There was such a great selection of vegetarian and vegan food that I was delighted and barely even realised that I missed non vegetarian food. The service was lovely and the location was fantastic.
5
Good fresh juices and salads. This place is now known for it's vegan donuts! Make sure to order in advance because they sell out quick!

Popped in here before visiting the temple. I had the curried pumpkin soup which was delicious. The menu had tons of veggie treats that I would happily have eaten too! Thx
5
Great place, great service!
Was surprised to find vegan ice scream. It seems that there are not a lot of vegan options in Singapore.
They also have vegan & vegetarian dishes and great desserts menu.

As a visitor to Singapore I was really craving some fresh food as opposed to a lot of the mock meat style vegan restaurants you can find plenty of in Singapore. I was happy to find this place and it hit the spot. I had their salad with soba noodles (fresh veggies with buckwheat noodles) and for dessert a raw chocolate cake with a scoop of matcha ice cream (the ice cream was a little too sweet for me personally). Overall for Singapore standards I think it was pretty good. The staff were really lovely and friendly
5
Having arrived in Singapore very late and not being in the mood for traipsing too far looking for food, I found this place 2 min walk from my hotel...some of the best salads I have ever had anywhere!! Enthusiastic young owner was very eager to make sure I was happy with food and that I was ok with all ingredients, etc.Returned early on my last day and was super-impressed with a massive veggie breakfast to send me on my way!

We bumped into this place while walking back from the Buddha temple to the MRT station. Since we are vegetarians and veggie fare at Little India would have taken some time to get to, we decided to check this place.It was a good choice. Though the place was more of a fine-dining experience with cutlery (we were with our young kids), the food was awesome! It was loved by the kids as well. We had a hot dog (mock meat), avocado wrap, pumpkin and broccoli soup, set meal, pasta. The staff was very helpful and caring! Would recommend it highly for a vegetarian experience

ordered a tofu burger, vegan style. what that means is the sliced cheese and hard boiled egg in the regular version is replaced with a side of tofu feta. $12.90, no additional taxes. excellent, warm service.burger was made with three slices of fried tofu (the "bun"), with tomato, cucumber, baby spinach, mock ham, mushrooms, ketchup and vegan mayo. served with herbed baby potatoes and seaweed chips.perhaps because my throat is not a big fan of fried food, my throat felt quite sandy after all the fried tofu and chips. might have been better if a side green salad was served instead of the potatoes, and the tofu was grilled rather than fried. very very filling and healthy meal for all my colleagues. overall an enjoyable meal for us although prices are slightly steep. think i'll return to try their shakshuka and brownies

This restaurant is ideal for celiac people (gluten-free options). Everything was so delicious and made with love. The staff makes you feel at home with the irresistible salads and desserts. The wrap (for non-celiac is also very advisable). Besides, there are also hot courses and typical Chinese food. We were so satisfied that we went for lunch and dinner several days. It was very difficult to find something similar in the city

Well Dressed is a great choice if you’re in Chinatown and can’t handle the food stalls where the locals go, behind the Buddha Tooth Museum. Food is fresh and tasty, the space is open and bright, clean and welcoming. The offer home made desserts and great coffee and espresso
5
Wasn't that hungry but felt like was missing some vitamins.Actually my plan was to have only the Almond Congee (sgd4.5), but after this warm and soft delight started feeling better and decided to try a salad.I got the tofu, quinoa, avocado, etc. plate (sgd12.5) .Added some fresh onions (sgd0.5) for some sour taste and clean the blood.Both the congee and salad were great! I am not vegetarian neither vegan but enjoyed a lot the taste and was quite satisfied with the volume!I am staying for few more days around and am looking forward to pass by again to try other salads.Thanks a lot

Escaping the heat and looking for a cool refreshing drink, we popped into this cafe near Chinatown. The juice drinks hit the spot!
5
street side eatery close to Chinatown friendly owner and good service. beautiful salad wraps and salads on offer.would highly recommend a visit.
5
This restaurant was a great find. I is just 2 blocks from the Hindu temple in Chinatown. The food was reasonably priced and there was a large section to choose from.

A great place to chill for brunch but not for dinner. Medium portion for a fried rice is equal to a small portion of fried rice. Not worth the money. However, their pepper monkey sandwich is a must try vegetarian sandwich ! ^^
5
Excellent dishes and very friendly staff! We had the curry and the mushroom sandwich, both were extremely tasty, especially given Singapore standards.
5
great location next to the buddha tooth temple (a minute from the mosque and hindu temple also), the mixed salad bar was fantastic value with generous portions to boot. very friendly people there, i returned a number of times. the vegan cakes were super. all served in a bright and air conditioned space with a pleasing view of world passing by on the south bridge road. a first class venue for friends, couples and travellers of all descriptions

We went to China town and found this little place as we were walking around.My wife is a vegan and she always finds it hard to find somewhere she can eat. This place is Well Dressed and it ticked all the boxes for her so the next night we went along for some food.I am not a vegetarian or vegan so for me it needed some meat, however I really enjoyed the food myself. My wife thought she had gone to heaven.The food is done fresh and the staff are vegans so they know what to do. It is not too expensive. The quality of the food is excellent, they also do dessert for vegans, so she was really happy bring away a chocolate brownie.It is not the easiest place to fine however if you have a map it is not that bad to find.Full address is280/282 South bridge street

Honestly if I could give Well Dressed six stars, I would. My vegan friend and I LOVED this restaurant so much we went back as often as we could during a recent trip to Singapore. The chilled coconut water, followed by some beancurd skins satay with peanut sauce, any of the salads, and the beetroot, avo and tofeta wraps were my favourite. Oh, and not to forget the all vegan chocolate brownies. I thought I had died and gone to heaven. If you're not a vegan or vegetarian (some of the salads have egg, and the ice-cream has dairy), I'm not sure how much it will appeal to you but if you are then I guarantee that you will be back. We found the owners to be extremely friendly and helpful, and when they were busy came over and warned us (with an apology) that the food might take a while and asked if we were happy to wait (which of course, we were).On my next trip to Singapore, this will be our first stop

My friend and I had nearly 2 hours between tours and we asked our guide on the first tour to recommend a place that had air conditioning and that would let us stay for a good amount of time. He took us here and it didn't disappoint.At first we were disappointed that it was vegetarian, but everything we ordered was tasty and satisfying. My friend ordered some kind of soup or stew that she thought was too spicy, but I loved everything. We ordered a variety of things and that was the only thing that wasn't to her taste.They seated us in a cool place, served us well and let us stay as long as we wanted. And the food was good. Can't ask for more than that

Nice little place just a few steps away from Buddha Tooth Relic Temple. A more than welcomed alternative to the chinese food everywhere else in the neighborhood. Salads are fresh, assembled in minutes and come in a pretty big size, for a very decent price. Great value-for-money and you get to keep on the healthy side
