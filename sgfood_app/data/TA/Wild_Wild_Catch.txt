the resturaunt is a small but great resturaunt. they serve a wide range of sea food. my reccomendation is the clams in sake broth. the resturaunt will be crowded in the evening and night.(around6pm.) try to go earlier and get the food. overall, i rate this resturaunt excellen

Came here for lunch with a friend. I have not heard of this place, Essen at the Pinnacle, until my friend recommended. The place is like a food court, but slightly upmarket in appearance. When I saw the place from the outside, I thought it was a bar/bistro. There were several stores here that sells various kinds of food. We happened to try out Wild Wild Catch, which sells "Fresh & Fusion Seafood Cuisine".We ordered the Fish and Chips and Pan-Seared Saba Fish sets. The set lunches cost S$13.50, and came with the main course, soup of the day, and a salad. The portion was bigger than we expected, so we were pleasantly surprised.The fish (with the Fish and Chips) was done well, crisp, not oily, not fishy. The fries were also crisp and not soft or oily.The have many other options on their menu and unfortunately we were not able to try them all.Overall, we felt the food was good value for money and the store definitely worth visiting again
