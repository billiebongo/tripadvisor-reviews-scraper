My bf and I ordered the slow braised lamb foreshank as well as the sauteed beef tenderloin. Both were cooked beautifully and the portion was just right. Nice atmosphere as well as good service provided by the staff. We'll definitely come back for more!

We went there during the weekend and we really love the food and set-up of the place. The duck confit and barramundi were really good. Service was good and attentive as well, will definitely be back!

We were here for lunch on a Sunday with friends. The restaurant was not very busy and we sat outside. The views are great. The menu sounded lovely. We had starters, main courses and dessert. The lobster bisque was embellished with too much cream. The mains were average - the tuna was tough. The accompaniments to the main courses arrived as we were finishing them. Water glasses weren't filled. They forgot about us after mains and we had to walk to the serving staff to get hold of menus for dessert. They were OK only. Not worth the prices charged. Not a restaurant we will be returning to

Lazy Saturday afternoon. The food was well presented and the service was good. Great way to have a chill out time with friends whilst enjoying some quay side views. Well don

Love this place. Have been here for lunch and dinner several times and it never fails to impress. Their food is reasonably priced and of a high standard when compared to other establishments in this area.Keep an eye out for what specials they have on as I have had some very nice/fresh oysters when they have them on special. Reasonably priced wines as well.I will be back

Came here for a simple lunch. We made use of the Entertainer 1-for-1 promotion, and were told both dishes had to be below $39. Quite odd since the restaurant will profit more from customers if the most expensive pick can be anything at all really.. so we opted not to have the lobster.The interior is a bit of an odd juxtaposition between the homely tables and the modernist wall decoration. Not feeling the vibe. Service is prompt and friendly, can't say much more about it.We ordered a la carte:Escargots are so-so: both the flavor of the garlic butter and tomato confit are too weak. A good restaurant will usually serve it with bread so you can mop up the sauce left behind; not here. Wild trout was good with spot-on crispy skin, the pasta nero it came with is one of the better we've tried in Singapore and certainly the best at Quayside Isle. Pan-seared tuna was good with a spectacular lychee-wine sauce and cream; complimented the natural flavor of the fish. Some of the broccolini it was served needed better trimming. Plating needs a little work. Ended with madagascar vanilla creme brulee. Fantastic dessert, it doesn't need the tuile or fruit toppings. You could scoop this up all day.French Quays, work out some kinks and you're looking at being one of the better places for a good meal on Sentosa

Most of the restaurants and cafes at Quayside Isle are very casual and, unfortunately, of relatively low quality. Bistro French Quays is new, however one of the better establishments. It offers a reasonably priced and decent food. We will be back again. Recommended.

Came here after a beach stroll with my dog. Decided to try here after looking at the menu. We ordered an escargots, angus beef for myself, duck leg confit for my wife and 2 pints of beer. Escargots were a disappointment, taste was not what I am expected. Sad to say, even the fastfood Saybons serve a better escargots than here. After waiting for another 30mins (restaurant was not even running on full capacity like others), my beef and my wife confit were here. Both dishes were so salty. Though we don't expect the food to be great, but this worse than expectation. However, 1 thing worth recommendation was the staff. I left my dog bowl under the table, this kind lady (did not managed to catch her name) help to keep the bowl

Shocking, that's the only word that comes to mind. Firstly, given it's French you would expect decent wine. The menu had 3 choices of red by the glass but we were informed 2 were not available. The 1 that was available was the cheapest bottle they had and was shockingly bad so I ended up eating my steak with a glass of passable Chardonnay. I suggested to the waiter that they should consider offering some of their better by-the-bottle wines by the glass given they have run out of the others and he said he would pass on my suggestion to the manager. 30 minutes later I was talking to the manager because they thought it was a good idea to serve all 4 of us our meals in sequence rather than together and I asked if he thought my wine idea was a good one. He had no idea what I was talking about so I repeated by suggestion. He replied, thanks for the feedback and walked away. Our meals took approximately 45 minutes to arrive and I mentioned to a waiter that it was unusual to be in a French restaurant and not be offered bread. I was told that they do have it available but you had to pay for it. Ok, if times as so tough they have to charge for 4 slices of baguette then so be but please at least offer it to people.The food was average, nothing to write home about. 25% of the steak I ordered was pure fat. The glasses of Chardonnay my wife and I received were a complete rip off. $14 each for 2 small sips - see photo. 1 waitress seemed genuinely attentive and interested, the others, including the manager, were completely useless. This is one of the more expensive restaurants as the Cove, definitely a waste of money. There are much better choices. Oh we miss Picotin
