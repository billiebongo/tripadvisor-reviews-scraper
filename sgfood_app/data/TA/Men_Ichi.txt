In my humble opinion, this place serves one of the best ramen I have ever tasted in Singapore. I particularly like the soup stock which is one of the best I have tasted - not too salty, just right!

The quality and standard of food is going downhill. I was there for dinner with friends and it didn't taste as nice as it used to be. Men-ichi used to be our favourite hunt for Japanese food in Yishun but looks like this will change.

Excellent Udon dishes, good for quick lunch. The duck black pepper udon, mentaiko beef udon and classic zaru udon are quite good.

This outlet which belong to the RES holding is on Japanese Street in NEX. At there, there are many Japanese outlets selling Japanese foods low to mid range dishes. This outlet is near the entrance of the Japanese street on left-side.Once we are there, the staff straight away direct us to the table for two. The arrangement of the tables is bit clamp maybe due to the small area and high rental cost.We order Kanitama Ramen & Salmon Teriyaki Ramen. The soup/broth is good except it is a bit salty. The serving is also fast. Can try again

Facility is inviting. Menu is well designed. Plenty of visuals. Service is good. I was concerned with the food based on what I read from other reviews.But guess what. Men-ichi ramen is honest to goodness authentic. Tonkotsu broth is tasty and creamy with its pork bone taste. The ramen is firm, without being soggy until end of the meal.The 6-piece gyoza was also worth recommending. Although size is small, I enjoyed the soft top and crispy bottom plus the mixture of veggies and pork inside. Pair these two (ramen and gyoza) with a cup of hot tea.Overall, value for money meal at Men-Ichi.

Alway have a nice dinner there as the prices are not expensive and filling. Also i like udon so this is a natural choice for me. On average depending on what you order is about $14 per pax. One bad thing will be the space between tables. It free seating so be prepared during peak hours to be fast to grab a table

Was pleasantly surprised that such an establishment can be found in Singapore. The quality of the food was terrific and the chefs behind the counter are very skilled in their craft. Best part of this is the prawn rice dish they serve at the end of the meal. Will be back

The Udon here are really nice and if you are looking for texture, go for the cold version. Service is fast and waiting time is really short too. U can also have side dishes and I recommend to get the crab stick. Worth the money too. Not recommended to get the prawn as it is sliced into half and then deep fried with a thick layer of flour

Revisited the restaurant to try the beef curry udon. The texture of the udon was still as good to my liking. The curry was thick and slightly sweet and spicy, with some vegetables. The thin beef slices were tender. The portion was very generous, can be very full after eating

Chanced upon the self service udon restaurant at Nex today. The concept is quite new in Singapore. One has to select the udon, choose the topping, make payment, then add in the condiments. After the meal, customers will return the tray.Tried the kamatama yuzu udon, it has a refreshing taste which I like. The pumpkin tempura was soft and sweet, the crab meat croquette was delicious too.Will visit again to try the curry udon which is their all time favourite
