The service stuff are very efficient and the quality of foods is great . The restaurant layout is classy to impress your date!

Few food selections but delicious. The ambience is great with the outside pool and sunset view. If there will be a chope voucher 50% off again I might come back.
5
Small spread but compensated by the food's quality. The dry-aged beef and pork belly were especially good.
5
I quite liked it. Food was good, had the roasted beef and lamb. I like the fish as well. Pasta was okay...

As the name suggest, Carvery specialises in meats n they do it well. The roasted chicken n pork ribs are absolutely delicious. The leg of lamb n prime ribs pale in comparison but they're still pretty good. Also enjoyed the deep fried duck. Desserts are so so though n overall the spread is small, but like I mentioned, they excel is meats n they really do those nicely. Service is prompt n friendly too. I enjoyed my dinner a lot. Thank

We made a reservation via email to dine at The Carvery for this Valentine evening.The reservations team got my name wrong despite using emails and my signature has my name included.Variety of food at the evening buffet was limited and visible at a glance. Items advertised on the papers such as iberico pork has to be asked, then served. Name of restaurant is Carvery but grilled items available were offered on a limited basis - 1 piece or slice person even when asked for additional servings. Perhaps for items can be offered as part of the grill or carvery area to live up to its name.Dessert crepe and pasta stations were manned by same person and was seemingly having difficulty coping during the peak. May be good to have some extra help as making burnt crepe and over-cooking pasta do not go well together.Overall atmosphere is warm and cosy with beautiful sunset view outdoors beyond the swimming pool horizon. Great place to go with your loved ones

Very disappointed on the food and service from The Cavery. The crab are rotten and can smell it right in front of it. I had informed the waitress abt it and was told they will inform the chef however no action is taken to remove the crab from the serving desk. What if someone taken the food and diarrhea! The soup taste funny and sour and seems like left over from morning, the pasta taste super salty. Overall not value for money, felted cheated and embarrassed to treat my customer at the restaurant

Featuring prime aged meats - usually a beef, chicken and other red /white meat slow spit roasted so it retains the natural juices and remains tender. A selection of flavoured salt/butter/gravies/sauces are available to accentuate the natural flavours. The side dishes are also noteworthy with special items making guest appearances at seasonal festivals. Come during weekend dinner to enjoy their Yorkshire pudding, something you hardly find in Singapore
2
The restaurant's operating hours are from 6pm to 10pm for dinner. I arrived at 8:30pm on a Thursday and was appalled to find that there was hardly any food left. Almost all the pots displaying the food were less than a third full. This is definitely not be be expected of a buffet restaurant that is more than an hour and half away from closing! The only consolation was there were still some meats available at the meat carving counter. It is not only unappetizing but also unbecoming for a hotel run restaurant. Not recommended
5
The roast meats are amazing, especially the roast beef. Interesting spanish theme and xmas theme, liked the churros and chestnut broccoli. Prefer this intimate buffet to the other big hotel restaurant with a wide spread. We can just enjoy the food and the ambience.Just hoping they replenish some of the desserts towards later part of the evening
4
Meat eg turkey, chicken and barramundi taste good. However, there is limited variety especially dessert. Nice pool view from restaurant though.
4
the buffet spread wasn't huge as compare to other buffet of the same price range but it more than made it up with the quality.
5
The quality and taste of the meat is superb, especially the Christmas special pork belly and turkey ham. It has a serene, romantic and relaxed environment. Can always walk out to the infinity pool area to chill.
4
Nice ambience, great view, delicious food.
The roasted chicken, vegetables, mushroom soup and mashed potatoes are simply mouth watering. Good place for a family meal.
5
The spread may be not as much but the food is great. Very good quiet ambience too. Best dessert ever eaten especially the apple crumple and stollen. I will definitely be going to this wonderful place again.
3
Nice restaurant for friends gathering, good pool view and scenery. Food options is a bit limited, and pricing in Christmas is bit of expensive in terms of the food varieties.
3
Average buffet. Best thing are the roasts, especially roast beef with all the trimmings, jus, horseradish or various mustards. Hot dishes are so-so although the smoked duck breast we had recently was good. Go if you can get a promotional rate otherwise there are many other better buffets out there
5
The spread veers towards Spanish. Mains include chorizos, baked salmon, roasted vegetables, etc. Meats are all well executed. Roasted pork had an awesome crackling, with an accompanying layer of melt-in-your-mouth fat. Roasted beef was nicely pink in the middle. Desserts were well done too. Service was a tad slow - more of an under staffing issue but still good service.The tables were nicely spaced out in the restaurant.
4
Carvery is a simple restaurant with a nice open view over trees and onto an attractive pool. The buffet spread is not that extensive and is all western. Some dishes were better than others. The pumpkin coconut soup was excellent--subtle and smooth to the taste. The meat was very tasty, though I found the lamb roast to be rather fatty at the same time. The vegetable offerings were delicious. Overall nothing fancy but sufficient if you are looking for a reasonably priced buffet. The down side was the service. It was a bit slow and the waiting staff not as attentive and efficient as in other restaurants
4
Was trying not to go to town for buffet lunch this year hence decided to give this place a try. The roasted beef was not bad. Tried the olive rice, lamb stew, cauliflower gratin, did not disappoint. Was hoping they have a wider selection of fruits especially not the tropical ones. Dessert selection was good. The mini chocolate eclairs are worth trying so is the mango mousse. The raspberry cake was a bit dry though. My kid wanted a second plate of spaghetti carbonara but was told they ran out of spaghetti and to replace with linguine. Pretty surprised as our lunch started almost soon after 12 pm when the buffet started and they already ran out of spaghetti. Nevertheless, the linguine pasta was still good. Like the ambience as restaurant is located on the 7th level in the hotel and we could see the pool right outside plus greenery.
5
The Carvery provides excellent service and food at a very affordable price. We had a great and enjoyable time.
3
The poolside view & ambience hugely compensated for mediocre choice, variety & quality of food as well as the slow service in removing our used plates & glasses.
3
As advertised, the meats served were good but overall buffet spread is very limited. Even for the meats, only 4 types were offered namely roasted beef, pork and chicken etc.
5
The service crew was attentive to our needs and the food was delicious! Would preferred if there was more at the dessert station.
4
Restaurant is cosy and spacious. Food and meat spread is great. Service is prompt and staffs are courteous. No problem with parking.
4
The restaurant was quite empty on a Tues night. However, food was good, choices were not many. There was a only about 3 types of cold seafood the rest was meat dishes. Very suitable for people who cannot eat seafood
4
We’re both craving a good old Sunday dinner. We found this place and was fantastic. An insane choice of different foods which are too many to mention. The beef was nice and pink and probably the most tender we have ever tasted. There is something here for everyone and all very high quality. It’s not getting 5 stars only because there was no roast potatoes. Sorry, it’s mean but you can’t have a carvery without roasties. Deserts were also many and very tasty. We had drinks outside by the pool which is also on the 7th floor of this hotel. Both had a Singapore Sling ... yeh of course. Mande by the very nice pool bar man. Magnificent view over the infinity. Should have bought some trunks. Staff were all really nice and very helpful. Dinner for two was 120 sing bucks. Bargain!!
5
The meats were very well done !!Pork skin on the roast was very crispy - as it should be !Beef was tender and done just right !The only thing was that the lighting was rather low....... I found it too dark.Perhaps, it's more for romantic couples..
4
The roasted beef is done with that nice pink in the middle & the roasted chicken is tender sweet...Only drawback is the replenishment of dessert cake, when the durian cake was finish they can only replaced with another kind of cake....Is it too expensive to replace durian cake as the cake was a relatively thin cake & don't think is sufficient for a 3/4 full house...The seafood on ice is fresh & for the price during lunch I have no complain..
2
Bad experience because their crockery stained with fishy smell. Replenishment was slow too. The spread wasn't exciting compared to 2 months ago. I regretted joining their Indulgence Plus membership. The meat station was fine but the chef doesn't look friendly to the guests. Need some improvement
4
We were given table overlooking the swimming pool, view not bad Not crowded on that day.The tiny bread freshly baked at the pizza counter look good, taste good too.
5
Food was amazing, wide choice of food and I wasn’t disappointed with the spread. Slightly on the pricier side though.
3
Overall good view, however limited choices of dinning and dessert available. Table height and sofa sits doesn’t go as the sits are on a high side not comfortable.
2
Good service and ambience, but not enough variety of food.
Steak too raw, can see bloody water dripping off from the beef.
Testure of roasted chicken was fantastic but tasteless.
4
The buffet spread is quality especially the roast meat section. Good value. The restaurant is by the pool. Good view and take some nice pictures.
4
The food variety not alot but all were nice. It is suitable for family or company events. I Wil visit again.

I redeemed a 1 for 1 voucher for a buffet dinner at The Carvery. After booking a reservation, I received an email confirmation and was advised that due to the Great Meat Feast that they are having, the weekend buffet dinner will be priced at $88++. I was excited with the array of meat they are offering. Despite the not so enticing reviews that Ive seen about this restaurant, I dared to give it a shot.We arrived at 8pm on a Friday night. The place got a lot of people but not packed. The pork and beef carvings can be easily seen from the entrance of the restaurant. Not much options and offerings but should be fine considering that the highlight of the buffet was the meat offerings. Ive requested for a slice of the beef and they handed me thin slices of dry aged aberdeen angus, john dee, mayura and black angus. I thought it was fine coz I could always come back. I was thinking to sample the pork carvings after Im done with the beef. I returned to the carving station before 9pm and no one is there. The meat offerings werent there as well. I thought maybe they were on break or something so I sampled the rest of the dishes offered. The seafood on ice were just prawns and oysters that are so small and doesnt look fresh. The salad station is okay. The lamb stew was great. The cheese selection was probably just 5 cheeses. The pizza section looks pitiful and the dessert station was so messy.I walked again to the carving station but theres really nothing there. They didnt take out new batches at all. So I just disappointingly returned to my seat and eventually paid $105 for the 1 for 1 meals with a heavy heart.For that amount, I couldve eaten at a better restaurant.
4
Having been to several hotel buffets, I appreciated that the variety offered here was different. It was more western style instead of international and local. I enjoyed the attempts of the beef bourguignon, the wine sauce clams, roasted veges, braised radish & the barramundi. The beef at the carving station was also enjoyable. The dessert variety on the other hand was abit too little. I arrived at 1.30pm for my lunch and sadly the dessert wasn't topped up at any point from when I arrived till I finished my meal.Overall it was an enjoyable meal experience.
4
I chose this place for a bday dinner treat after work to my hubby. It was nice to know a pleasant and accommodating staff like Nelson ( who make a way to serve a special cake for my hubby and staff Irin ( very nice Receptionists). I enjoyed the fresh oyster and seafood with curry sauce. My Husband also enjoyed the meat and how they served it. Will definitely comeback here with friends, or maybe plan to check in so that we can enjoy the infinity pool in front of this restaurant. Thank
2
Although meat is supposed to be the highlight here, only 3 types are served - chicken (quite tasty), lamb and beef (very raw and bloody). They are quite good with their mediterranean food - freshly baked pizzas and interesting bread rolls baked with parmesan. The views outside of the infinity pool were alluring. The selection of food is rather limited. No butter was provided for the rolls, I had to ask and was just proferred a single piece. However, what made me rank this poorly was that my wife had diarrhoea 5x after eating the salads (twice in the restaurant) and another 3 more on the journey. We didn't highlight this to the management as she initially thought it was due to overeating. The prices are moderate. Coupled with the small selection and unhygienic food, I'm not returning again
5
38++ for 2-hrs of beef, lamb chicken
Salads, entrees, side dishes, dessert
Coffee too. View of swimming pool
5
This place is very good int eems of food and service. The ambiance is great as well. I highly recommend this to everyone
4
The ambiance is great and has a nice view. Food is great but has only few options. The staffs are all friendly and hospitable. Value for money is So-so.
3
A good value buffet but some items had run out before 1:30pm, including the roast lamb. Dessert selection was limited and not very child friendly.
3
The meat served at the carving station is pretty good, however the accompanying buffet spread is limited. I was looking forward to good dessert at the end of the meal but was pretty disappointed by the selection available.
4
Good meats and reasonable variety on the buffet. Have been there for both lunch and dinner. Would return!
4
Coming in at about 1pm, i felt that most of the food were not replenished because of the low human traffic. It's a really quiet place for a quiet gathering/meeting. For a restaurant supposedly specialising in meat, i expected more choices of meet. Service, though, was excellent and the staff was friendly. As for value, i redeemed a one-for-one voucher so i felt that i was worth it. The spread on offer does not warrant the original price
5
The meats and desserts were very good. There was also salad with nice toppings and a small cheese bar. With the SAFRA 1 for 1, it was affordable. There are many different salts and sauce to pair with the meats. My favourite is the mint sauce for the lamb, black salt for the beef and red salt for the chicken.
5
Part of the Park Hotel Alexandra, the Carvery is located on the 7th floor overlooking the swimming pool and the wonderful view of Singapore buildings. The food served is very good and the breakfast is very good bread. The dining area extends towards the swimming pool area, which guests are free to use. The staff are very prompt and supportive
2
I ordered the boneless leg of lamb (big plates lunch). The lamb came looking really pale – and tasted pretty much the way it looked. The dish was also dry – there was no hint of any sauce. Really doubt I will give this place another visit
4
This was the first time that I ate at the Carvery and I wasn't disappointed. Great meats, quality selection and a great ambience and view.
3
Had the the 'big plates' for lunch, chicken was good but beef is not (cold, dry and tasteless). Bread basket (4 variety) tasted great and service was good. Quiet and comfortable setting, good for catching up!
3
The service is attentive in their services. The only setback was the limited range of food available.
5
Good food and selection. The prime rib is their specialty and it did not disappoint. A good balance of starters, main course and desserts.
3
Restaurant is a part of Park Hotel. The service is good, but if you are an Indian and that too a vegetarian that you cannot have anything to have.
4
A value for money venue. The meat served is good & juicy. The other dishes offered at the buffet is equally good.
4
Great for kids as usual but due to it being a special occasion, prices are a little steep. No ice cream though.
4
I love all the sauce that is available to go with the meat. There was roast pork, roast beef and roast chicken on the carving counter. My favourite sauce was the truffle butter.
4
Came based on reviews that the meats were good. The roast beef, chicken and roast pork were excellent. The condiments were good too with many choices. The soups and pasta were too salty and dessert selection needs improving. Also, we were party of 7 and they sat us with 3 tables, squeezing 4 on one side which was uncomfortable and inconvenient to get food.
2
I booked a set lunch for 2 Big Plates on June 2017 at Cavery after having visited their website and read about it. Thought it was great value for money since it costs only $19++. However, I was shocked to find the beef was dry and probably kept for days in the fridge. The greens and corn were also not fresh and looked as though they have been kept for few days in the fridge.
4
I felt that the meat spread for the buffet was awesome. The overall spread was good. However, the free-flow wine for the mothers taste bitter and rough for a 2015 cabernet sauvignon.
4
Quantity is not a wide spread but quality is thumbs up!! Ideal for food lovers who look for quality food rather than quantity.
5
Most excellent selection of meats and other food. Staff very attentive and helpful, great for families with young kids. Chef even helped me cut up the pizza slice into bite size for my toddler!
4
I would highly recommend this place for lunch for anyone with a lunch budget of $80/pax, loves me, hates crowd, wants good service and doesn't mind an awesome pool view to boot!
4
A western restaurant with good food and nice environment. The heat wood-fired grilled beef and lamb were excellently done. Buffet comes with nice range of salad greens, appetizers and desserts. A complimentary cup of beer was served.
5
The environment is very pleasant, with pool by the side of the restaurant. Food is great for meat lovers and presentation of the food is excellent!
5
The staff at the Cravery was polite and responsive to our needs. The food was excellent especially the meats which they are known for. My family had a fantastic Easter Sunday lunch!
5
There was some mis communication when making reservation by using Chope VIP program voucher. Therefore after my lunch, I was unable to redeem the voucher. The restaurant manager understood the situation and agreed to accept this voucher. I'm impressed with his attitude and service. A happy customer will return and bring more customers
2
The selection of food wasn't alot. I came because of the meat. The meat selection was not fantastic consider the priceI was disappointed with the meat. I expect the meat to be grilled on the spot for you. But it was all grilled and left on the counter. So it is rather cold
5
I like this place cos of the meats they offer and in particularly beef. The ribeye was good and tender. Pull pork not bad but i fancy roast pork more. the pasta was as usual good. Im not a dessert lover but the waffle was crisp and nice. Not fluffy but i like it crisp
3
The cream sauce pasta was extremely salty, hot cross buns are not fresh but overall other hot food items are delicious, I really need to emphasize about the service, outstanding & excellent
4
Spread was limited but the restaurant made up for it with attentive service and food quality. Roasted pork was excellent
4
We had 7 pax and a bottle of wine. We ended up paying for 4 pax because of a bank credit card promotion. Very worth it!
Worth mentioning is the roast beef, Yorkshire pudding and mash. Lovely!
5
In house restaurant of a new hotel located at the Alexandra / Bukit Merah area. New, clean and less crowded. Items are more exquisitely prepared and less voluminous which makes buffets elsewhere feel like cook houses.
3
This place gets busy and crowded when tour groups come for breakfast. The hotel recommends showing up between 6.30 to 7.15 am to ensure a place to sit. 7.15 am onwards, you will most likely need to stand-in-line.
5
Even though there was not a lot of food selection, but every food on offer there was of high quality and taste excellent!! The service staff was also very helpful and attentive. We will definitely be going there again.
4
As befitting its name, the highlights of the buffet at The Carvery were its tender roasted meats.
The sirloin and prime rib were especially good. The rest of the cooked dishes weren't slobs either.
4
Had a weekday dinner at Carvery. Nice atmosphere, good service. Spread is small. Seafood wise there are prawns on ice as well as oysters. Beef, roasted chicken n pork at the carving station. A pasta station, some cooked dishes n a dessert corner. Lucky the taste n quality of the food made up for the limited spread. The chicken n pork were esp tasty! Just 3 suggestions. The sofa seating while cosy makes it difficult for the person seating inside to exit to get food. Not so suitable for a buffet. The chicken, while nice, tends to be a bit overcooked n dry after 1 to 2 hrs into the buffet as they are left in the oven n it will be nicer if you can increase the spread slightly. Frankly price also tends to be a bit high, but given the quality of the food, it is still fair. Had an enjoyable evening in all. Thanks
3
Average hotel buffet spread. Like the roast beef and chicken. Would suggest roast the beef a little more as it was rather raw and bloody in the middle. Decent lunch without crowd on a Friday. Good and attentive service. The chef at the meat carving was MIA for a while so would need to get the attention of the service staff
4
Had dinner at The Carvery on a Saturday. The roasted meats did not disappoint. As mentioned by several other reviewers, the roasted chicken was tender and succulent. The spread of buffet was reasonable - there were oysters, mussels, prawns and salad, in addition to the spread of roasted meats and casseroles. The apple crumble is a must try from the dessert counter
3
Limited options for vegetarians. Desert was good, especially the apple crumble, the trufle and pastries.
5
They had a wide buffet spread which was really good. I was too full to try everything. The dinner buffet was about SGD 55++ and so worth it.
4
First visit on 30 Jan 2017 -- good range of Western cuisine -- well done, not salty and great service with good location. Price is good if there is a 1 for 1 promotions!
4
Dining at The carvery is very enjoyable, service & food are both excellent.
Wasn't really impressed by the overwhelming apple crumble. It was the roasted lamb leg & chicken that make my day & of cos my favourite mashed potato. Best roasted lamb ever!
1
Awful food at a ridiculous price. We were hopimg for a wonderful christmas day but were thoroughly disappointed
3
Average because more stew this year. Only food worth attacking were the oysters and roast beef. Did not like them harassing me to fill in credit card form to secure the booking else risk a no show full charge of the bill. Don't like these kind of business model. Probably won't celebrate valentine's there agai
4
Reasonable varieties of food ranging from salad to meat. Food portions prepared for buffets are not too much so good to have hot food for every dish except for cold cuts and dessert, of course.Food tastes good and view looks beyond to greens of trees in the Alexandra park was great 
4
Always had to wait for the chef to come out from the kitchen to carve the steak lamb and pork. Food was not well heated. Cold seafood items very few on display. Especially the oysters. Not a good sign when you can fit the oysters displayed on to one plate. also the oysters need to be rinsed better after being opened. the staff was good and friendly. however there was this staff who gave me the cheque, i informed him that i was a guest at the hotel and should have a 20% off. This should have already been in the system because of the following things:1. Reservation for this was made through Park Hotel via Crystal Club- Carvery should have already indicated this in the cheque2. the change of the reservation from 7:30 pm to 8:00 pm was made from the crystal club as well. with these to indicating factors, carvery should have already been informed and such an incorrect receipt should have not been given. but that's not really the problem. When the staff gave me the receipt and i pointed out that there should be a 20% off because we are currently staying in the hotel. He asked me to sign on the receipt first and then he will key in the discount. This should not be the case at all. Signing on that receipt meant that I acknowledged that price instead of what i should be charged. I kindly asked if he could print out a receipt that showed the correct amount which then i would sign. The staff have an irritated expression and said okay and walked off. He then passed me the correct receipt which i then double checked, took abit of time to check due to the dim lighting and i left my glasses in the room and i signed it and passed it to him to charge to the room. I kindly said thank you when i passed it to him but he just walked away. Quite a different service in Carvery from that particular staff compared to the world class service which the team at the Crystal Club exemplifies. A room for improvement perhaps? Don't get me wrong, the food WAS good and me and my wife were glad to have spent our 1st wedding anniversary dinner at the Carvery. Hoping that the staff's behaviour was an isolated incident, perhaps he was tired, or needed to attend to something else or really really had to go to the toilet.Btw, one of the female staff said the swimming pool was heated. Not the case. Haha
2
With a name like the Carvery, you would expect the chef to be carving large pieces of meat onto your plate... instead of shaving thin little slices of pork and beef. Please, don't make the excuse 'you have to ask for thicker slices', we shouldn't have to ASK for anything. You should train your staff to serve PROPER portions
5
Excellent!After a long time, enjoyed a good buffet spread of lunch in a cosy restaurant. The spread was just nice. The turkey was succulent and superb. Slurp!The hotel staff were courteous and attended to us promptly. Special thanks to Ms. Devi! Christmas magic! Pls keep it up!
2
Lack variety, poor lighting and perhaps lack a theme. It was a first visit for the Christmas dinner.
5
Our party of 10 really enjoyed the food & ambience. Plus the service staff were all very attentive. We had a great time. We all stayed til the restaurant closed. So you'll know that we really liked the place!
5
Every dish was excellent and the staff were extremely prompt and attentive. Also great value for money.
Will definitely be back again!
4
meat, meat and meat, as the name of the place indicates.
You will find quality food there but dont expect a large variety. For the price, errmm, i might consider adding twenty-odd bucks for a more high-end buffet with more variety of food
5
Nice ambience. Not a very big premise but very cosy. Great roast meat and food selection, though not as huge a variety compared to other buffet, it is good enough to sample a bit of everything and still very filled!Most impressive and unique is the variety of sauce, salt and mustard sauces to go with the roasts, also the yorkshire pudding is a great companion to the roasts
3
The quality of the food was pretty bad during lunch hours. The first time i went during dinner was so much better, the roast pork was good. Lots of food was pretty disappointing, cabonara pasta was hard and tasteless, pizza bread was hard and the toppings were bitter. Good service and great atmosphere, but the food was not worth the price i paid for. Not coming back again
2
Went there almost a year ago when it was still quite new. This second time round, my review is not glowing, mainly because of the poor service. Price went up, but service standard dropped. If not for the quality of the food, I would have rated it terrible.Hubby placed a dinner reservation for three and stated that it was for his birthday celebration. However, there was no complimentary cake served unlike in other hotels. To make it worse, they gave us a table which was situated in the "middle of walkway" when there were a few empty booth seats. Those seats were empty throughout our dinner, and there were no "reserved" tags placed on them. Perhaps we were the odd number of 3 and not 4? So they were saving the table for walk in customers of 4? If that's the case, one might as well not place a reservation. Just walk in and request for the booth seat. The place is half empty anyway.According to hubby, the quality of the food is still good (He's the meat lover). For a seafood lover like me, the selection is frankly quite pathetic. I do admit they have a variety of cuts for their beef. The chef at the carving station also gave me the names of the various cuts and what condiments to eat them with when I asked him. So if you are a beef lover, you will be over the moon. Give it a miss if you are not, as the other dishes are nothing to shout about. The quality of their limited hot dishes also dropped as compared to last year.They only serve plain water. Didn't know the buffet actually came with normal coffee and tea, until we saw other patrons with coffee and tea on their tables and asked the staff. Really terrible service. Usually at other hotels, if the buffet spread does not have the automated coffee machine and tea bags for self service, the staff would have asked you if you prefer coffee or tea right at the start and if you want it to be served now or later. Don't think will be going back anytime soon and will not recommend to people
3
My host had organized a small dinner with four of us at a pre-conference meeting at The Carvery. Reputed to be a good place for meat lovers. However we were disappointed as the selection was limited. Some of the dishes we asked for and were on the buffet menu, took too long to be replenished at the buffet table. Good spread of meat and buffet, but they could do with more fish dishes as well. They should also expand the variety. Good spread of dessert though
3
Went there to catch up with old friends and thought it would be a good place to have meat. Service was mediocre and food was standard and no wow factor for the price paid for weekday dinner.Food selection was small.Desserts were ok.This is not something I would rave about
4
My sons wanted to go there for the various beef cuts available. It is really worth if you like beef and are a big eater. The selection for salads, cooked food, desserts are pretty good though limited compared to other hotel buffets. I would say we got more quality and quantity so it is a good thing. We got 20 % off when we paid with Citibank credit card so it is not one of those 1 for 1 offers. Overall a pleasant experience but may not go back anytime soon
4
Love the roast meat. Not a lot of variety. Roast veg was burnt and greasy. All in all, the roast meat/carvery is what we like.
5
Staff were very friendly and provided excellent service. We had the meat feast and the buffet counter was also very good .
3
Good service from staff. Generally friendly and obliging
Range of food was rather limited and speed of replenishment was rather slow too
3
Limited Variety. The oysters are replenished at a slow rate. Still acceptable for the price of a 1-for-1 deal.
5
Cracking restaurant with an offer of a high end buffet style carvery. 5 beef options, chicken, salmon, coq au vin, pork, pasta, pizza etc etc. Plenty of starter options, salads and extras. Desserts and coffee also included. Eat as much as you can! The oysters were lovely and everything was fresh. Lovely service too and knowledgable chef
4
Visited on 28 Sept 2016. The Carvery is sitting with Park Hotel Alexandra, sharing the infinity pool, and the swanky poolbar on the same level.Cosy interior, breathable space between each table. Unlimited premium meats that are sliced to order. Besides, there are wood-fired pizzas, salad greens, seafood, oysters, Yorkshire Puddings, and delectable desserts.This place is more on quality than to quantity. The service here is good. Plates were cleared and water is refilled promptly. Food quality is of our good expectation, except for the pizzas were a tad bland. As for the desserts, too sweet for us to have more :)A complimentary birthday slice cake was served, as I sang birthday song to the hub. We loved this place and will definitely come back again.

My mum decided to treat my father's lunch celebration at the Carvery in July due to her close friend's recommendation. She even cancelled the original reservation at one of her favourite Chinese restaurants just for this occasion."Wow," I thought. What kind of restaurant can make her do that? To think that she is not a fan of Western food. A search online ensured and all seems promising. It was not meant to be though when we were greeted by a limited array of food and less than impressive tastes. We were all disappointed by we decided to take it as an experience.Turned out that my mum's friend went for the dinner instead and insisted that that could be the difference. Personally, I really doubt so if the chefs are the same ones. If not, one would really wonder what the Carvery is trying to suggest with the difference in standards

not a bad spread which includes a pasta/pizza station as well as roast. for some reason though the chef wasnt too happy when he had to serve the slightly undercooked roast beef or the yummy pork knucklewas good that buffet comes with coffee or tea and that we had options.service was mixed. great view as it was on the pool side leve

I went on a Wednesday night when there was a one-for-one promotion for ladies. It was quiet until after 7.30pm, I think, so there were no long queues to contend with. Yeah!I enjoyed the beef and barley soup, it's so hearty. It's a little too salty for me, but I still enjoyed it. I wouldn't mind having a big bowl on its own for dinner, but then I was here for a buffet so I made do with half a bowl. The lamb stew was good; while the bigger chunk was drier in the middle and tougher, the smaller chunk was tender.There was no salmon sashimi but there were the somewhat bland poached salmon and prawn dishes (both warm) that I ate with truffle butter, anchovy butter, black lava salt and honey mustard with champagne. I loved the truffle butter - it's worth the risk of clogged arteries. I liked the salt too.The roast meats were good, be it the chicken or beef. I alternated between eating the meats alone and eating them with the condiments. Heaven on earth! I kept dabbing at the salt and butter, BP be damned. As for the pork knuckle, I had trouble cutting and biting through the skin, but whatever I could get in my mouth were crispy and fragrant. The chefs at the roast meat station looked friendly so I think they would be happy to make recommendations when one gets confused by the wide array of condiments and gravy sauces.When it got too heavy for me, I finally reported at the salad station. The papaya salad with beef was too sour for me but it seemed to work on my digestion very quickly. The magic of enzymes. I enjoyed the watercress with goji too, although I don't normally care for watercress.The gripe I see online is that the spread is not huge enough, but I think for the average Asian girl, it is more than enough. I did not even manage to try everything. The only drawback was the lack of sashimi; it's one of my buffet "staples".There were not many dessert and fruit options but the trifle and chocolate cake were good, although the trifle was a little too sweet for me. There was an interesting and not-so-common coconut dessert but unfortunately I am not into coconut.There was a drinks promotion but I simply could not risk wasting my bellyhold capacity.The wait staff were attentive and quick to acknowledge my raised arm while they were going to another table that had to be attended to first.The pool view is not much of a draw because the reflection gets in the way and the pool is a distance away. Still, diners are more likely to be focusing on the food, their company and their handphones :) As I was seated near the entrace, I got to enjoy the swimwear parade put up by hotel guests, who continued to come even after 9pm.Price-wise, I am happy because of the one-for-one promotion, but I am not sure I want to pay full price. Still, it was a meal that i really enjoyed. Hope to come back and check out the Yorkshire pudding, broccoli, mushroom and more salts

Located next to rooftop pool of the Park hotel. You dine facing the outdoor pool view and city scape. The interiors is spacious, uncluttered with high ceiling. We had a weekend buffet. The dishes were all freshly prepared; non of those pre-packed frozen food you find in some places. The roast beef is excellent. Thin crust pizzas were baked in the concrete wood fired oven. The staff service is good too.Will be back soon.

Calvery had wonderful service staff and hospitality, making the dinner truly special for my guest. Spread of food of good quality and value for money. The seating arrangement was spacious and comfortable. Truly enjoyed the dinner
5
The baked chicken was very juicy, and the variety of salts and sources were very impressive. I had no chance to try the pasta.
4
This is my 2nd visit, while I have to say the roasts are good, I hope there could be more varieties.
The rest of the spread are pretty good as well, carefully selected to go along with the roast meats.
4
Beef roast is is very tender an well marbled. Oysters are also very fresh and tasty. However replenishment of food is slow. Sometimes we need to request for more items before they brought out of the kitchen
4
A good selection of European and Asian food. The staff are very helpful without being at your table all the time .
3
I guess, for a place that calls itself the Carvery I was expecting a better selection of meats but it really fell short.
5
Delicious food, great attentive service and nice atmosphere! We totally enjoy ourselves during our time there! Would go back again!!
5
Prime rib is only available Friday/Saturday nights for a little more than standard dinner buffet prices. Definitely splurging for this option as it was cooked perfectly! The rest of the buffet was pretty good too!
5
Fantastic quality and service even when very busy eating by the pool or while in it a decadent experience.
4
Place is quiet with very good background instrumental music. I love the desserts and the pasta.
My fiancee love the fish.
Coffee is perfect after meal :)
4
Not a big variety but good quality food. Meat dishes are good so are the side dishes. Soup is fantastic. Desserts can be better though
3
The variety of dishes can be improved especially for the desserts. Quality of food is average. Atmosphere is noisy.
4
Good quality cooked food! Oysters are plump and fresh. The staff are attentive and polite. The only flaw is dim lighting.
4
Love the carved beef, marinated mushrooms and huge cooked shrimp. They started putting things away a bit early before lunch actually closes so I recommend going at least 2 hours before closing time.
5
We took our 8 month old and 2 year to the Father's Day dinner. The staff were Super accommodating and so friendly. Food was delicious especially the roast beef and Yorkshire puddings.
5
Very good food that suits our preference, good services and dining experience. Perfect ambience. Overall is better than expectation.
4
Food was replenished rather slow. There were different types of salt but no indication of the name of the salt. Roasted beef and mussels were good.

Recently visited this new restaurant @Park Hotel. Staff are polite and courteous, service is swift, it's not so crowded (may be Coz it's new) so you can enjoy a relaxed meal with your loved ones. View of the infinity pool adds soothing calmness to the ambience.Menu is a good balance of select meat (carved), sea food (scallops were delicious, and a rare find in Singapore buffets), Italian (pizza and pasta quality can be improved) as well as local dishes for rice and veggie lovers.Sum it up with select variety of tasty desserts, and you have a decent evening with family!I would say, good value for money, and certainly a must try! For now: every second diner gets 50% discount, and every booking of 4 or more packs gets a complimentary bottle of wine

The restaurant is within Park Hotel in Alexandra. It is a medium sized set-up and had a very simple formula for the buffet. The heart of the buffet is the roast section with succulent meat - beef, lamb, pork knuckle and chicken. The roasts were fantastic and the meat selection was accompanied with variety of condiments. The rest of the stations were well spread out and although there were not many stations, the restaurant had maintained a good balance of food. The desserts, particularly pudding and cheesecake were delightfully great. The staff were very helpful and we had a comfortable dinner. This restaurant is inconspicuously located in Alexandra but it is a lovely place to have a family dinner

The array of dishes isn't huge, but everything I tried was good, if not great. Roast beef was good, but for me the star was the roast chicken! I avoid breast meat wherever possible, but the white meat served to me was cooked to perfection and went splendidly with the chicken gravy and truffle butter. I think the condiment selection is great, although I do wish everything was labelled. The hot gravies for the meats could be better - veal jus was bland and did nothing for the roast beef.The oysters - fresh and sweet and delicious, although they were quite slow to replenish those. The hot vegetable dishes were perfectly prepared too. The kitchen's benefited from a streamlined buffet menu.Service was sincere, and the staff took immediate action when we commented that it was too cold. Would definitely return

If you love meat as much as you love yourself, THIS is the place to feast! Oh my god, the roast beef is amazing...even now I still dream about it...

Not that much selection of food . Little green vegetable. Too much meat. Cold station is too few selection for seafood.
4
Wonderful roast beef with Yorkshire puddings! The roast chicken was pretty good too! The rest of the starters & mains were decent. Loved the walnut quince served with the cheese selection. I found the desserts a bit of a let down... only the almond panna cotta was good.Overall, a very enjoyable roast dinner with unlimited (well executed) roast beef at a reasonable price. Will return again
4
The roast station is good. You have to try their roast beef and pork knuckle. There is a good range of condiments to go with the roast. They serve seafood and oysters for dinner and a variety of salads at the side. As for the mains, the food is pretty decent and they have a live station for pasta which is quite good. They also have a pretty good range of cheese for cheese lovers. The dessert station is nice but not spectacular.
4
Excellent quality of food - a variety of meats like roast beef (the highlight), chicken, truffle butter (which was simply amazing); the selection of sides was not too bad, but they were not as impressive as the meats and the desserts!Excellent service too - there was no more of a particular dessert I wanted, and when I asked, the manager requested from the kitchen and it was out within a couple of minutes (unlike some other supposedly better restaurants that may take a while). Great ambience; overall, a wonderful visit

If a restaurant is selling Sunday lunch in a Carvery then there are certain classic dishes which are to be expected. The roast beef, roast lamb and chicken were perfectly cooked and generous portions too. The range of mustards and sauces were plentiful. But to not have Yorkshire pudding, roast potato, potato gratin, Brussel sprouts makes the lunch fall short by a long way. The chef says the Yorkshire puddings are available in the weekdays only! So whats wrong with Sunday?Nice hotel ambience, good staff. But missing those critical ingredients is highly disappointing. Please try harder you know you can do it. Then I'd by back every Sunday

It was a graduation celebrations and birthday celebration and so we decided to go to a buffet as a group of 10 can choose what they prefer to eat through buffet. As we have more meat eater in the group I decided to picked a buffet with more meat choices. The varieties may not be as many as some other buffet but for the price of one for one (credit card promotion) I find the price reasonable. The roast station has 4 type of roast from chicken to pork knuckle and beef. I especially love the pork knuckle and roast chicken. Not forgetting the fresh succulent oysters sitting at a corner of the restaurant. The pasta is cool to order and personally I find the pasta not really enticing, tasted slightly below average. Feedback from my siblings that the roasted beef is really goodness! I've tried on almost everything and was pretty surprise with the quality of the food. Overall I find the food served generally tasted good and nice.

First visit to the Carvery and we quite enjoyed it. As it was Mother's Day, prices were jacked up (expected). Prices for normal days look quite value for the money though. Food was good - lots of stuff for kids to eat. Desserts were also top notch. Only minus is probably the variety; less than usual buffets
4
A very cosy place for a quiet dinner with family or friends. The ambience is really good with soft lighting. As this is not the big, bustling type of buffet restaurant, it gives you a more upmarket feel. I would say that the buffet spread is not big but adequate. There's cold seafood, hot dishes and desserts. The main highlight here is definitely the roast station. As we were here for a Sunday dinner in December, there was roast turkey available. It was tender and juicy, and we went for seconds, even thirds. The roast lamb is worth mentioning as well. Hubby really enjoyed this buffet as he's a meat lover. Go if you want quality of food rather than variety. Almost all the dishes we tasted are above average in our opinion.For the dessert, I fell in love with the eggnog. Didn't know eggnog tasted this great!One thing seriously lacking is the choice of drinks. There's only plain water available. It would be great if some coffee, tea, and fruit juices are offered as well. I would recommend this place for meat lovers

Carvery was a pleasant experience not that crowded with quite attentive staff... Food wise not a wide selection but it make up for it in quality.
4
Limited range of food but of good quality. Wednesday dinner had oysters, prawns, mussels but no sashimi. Roasts - chicken, pork and beef with many choices of accompanying sauces & mustard. Not much variety of dessert.
Service was excellent. Drinks refilled and plates cleared regularly.
4
Not too crowded. Nice place for business discussion and small gathering. Food quality is good and very value for money with 1-1 credit card promotion.
3
Overall, I like the ambience more than the food. Variety of food avail is not a lot but I find it reasonably sufficient. My only dissatisfaction is most prob the chef at live stations always MIA.
3
It wasn't the best buffet I've had by a long shot. Although there was variety, but the tastiest offering was the hash browns, there might be a small problem with the kitchen.
5
You will be greeted and seated effificently. Food choice caters for everyone. Check out the Pizza bread. Chef special. Very enjoyable and highly recomended food for all.

We wanted to explore a new place and Park Hotel Alexandra - The Carvery was our choice. Booking was easy, we had an Indulgence Card that gave us 20% off for 5 pax but if you come on weekdays the current promotion is 1 for 1 for UOB card holders. As the name suggests , the meats were superb. Roast Beef was really succulent at a medium rare doneness. The meats were not marinated but the selection of herbs and spices were exquisite, they even had volcanic salt. We also had roast pork knuckles , the skin was so crispy and light and the meat was so tender. There were the usual selection of cold cuts, including oysters that were really fresh , but were a tad small compared with other restaurants. The cooked food had a wide array of seafood ( sautÃ©ed squid and prawns) , beef goulash, several weeners and some nice green vegetables like french beans. They had a reasonable selection of cheese including my fav blue cheese and water biscuits. There was vegetarian pizza and fresh pasta that was made by one of the cooks , we had olio ogoli. We brought 2 bottles of wine but had to pay $45 corkage , was ok as we had a ice bucket to chill out wines. The whole Restraunt was spacious and the lighting was cosy. The swimming pool and outdoor bar was just outside on this 7th level of the hotel. The service was excellent had to mention Jonathan and Tamil Arasan for their excellent service and watching over us until the place closed at 10.30pm.

Came here for my family's chinese new year lunch celebration of more than 10 people. We had the buffet and was there around 12pm. Unfortunately, not all the foods were presented or ready. Many of us agreed that several of the foods were salty or just failed. The pasta was way too oily. The pizza crust was hard. The fresh salads and seafood spreads were great, though. For the desserts, the cakes were on the drier side which disappointed us. The pumpkin creme brule was good. With a great ambience of the pool, I hope the restaurant will improve more

Place for people who loves meats and is western dishes. Hmmm don't remember seeing a bread section.Very small section for cold food. Prawns is very fresh. My favorite.Crepes is freshly make when you order. Decent dessert counter.Overall food is ok. Don't expect a huge buffet spread and will not be disappointed .Place was rather cold for our comfort. Suggest bringing a shawl... Just in case

We had X'mas dinner buffet there.The range of savory is decent, like what many hotels offer at a buffet.The taste of the savories are good, especially the duck.The staffs were pretty prompt in clearing the table.The only area for improvement will probably be the range of dessert selections. It can be more. Please do consider adding a few more items
