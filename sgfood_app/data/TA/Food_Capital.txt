Variety was pretty good and quality of food generally good. Service acceptable. ambience was pleasant and good for gatherings.
3
I was touched and greeted by the smiling staff who literally defeated the absence of lobster and chilli crab for dinner. Most probably, I would go there again if there is a 1-1 promotion.
4
My family was there for our Chinese New Year's Eve reunion dinner and found the wait staff polite and chirpy despite the number of dinners they had to attend to that night. Empty plates were cleared quickly and unobtrusively. The selection of fresh seafood was a favourite at our table. But if you are not into seafood, you would not find the buffet value for money. There's a good spread of desserts to please those with a sweet tooth.
3
Went to Food Capital with friends. The food is not bad - the sashimi is of good quality, the tempura is well done and I liked the papaya soup with white fungus. However, there is no way to consume $88 worth of food so unless there is a hefty discount, I would not want to come for dinner. Alacarte members get 50% off for up to 12 diners but even then the bill comes to about $52 per pax all in
5
My best friend and I decided to visit Food Capital since our last visit few months back, we cannot forget the food here - so sumptuous. We love the seafood, soup, beef, satay, sashimi, laska, desserts and so much more that we cannot eat all at the same time - that is why we are always back for more. Every visit will be a new surprise for us with the different varieties. The chefs are so friendly and always put on a smile on their face even they are busy preparing or serving the guests. A BIG THANK YOU to Chef Magdalene Tan who recommended us to try out the new dishes and it's very YUMMY. This is one of our favorite place for dinner and catch up. We will come again soon
5
Dining at Food Capital, Grand Copthorne Waterfront, is a different experience. The Restaurant provides a good variety of cuisine, both chefs David Toh & Magdalene have been creative with the international spread which is bountiful and wins hands down for its superb quality!A word of praise must go to the service staff, Steven Wu, who made us feel welcome and served us attentively throughout the night. Keep up the good work - we'll keep coming back
5
We had lunch at Food Capital on one Saturday. Oysters and prawns are fresh. There are snow crab legs, varieties of of sushi, salmon sashimi, tuna sashimi, freshly fried tempura, roast beef, laksa etc. The dessert spread is good. The ice cream was creamy.Service is good and food is replenished quite fast. We got the 50% off deal at eatigo which makes the buffet worthy
3
book dinner for 3 from eatigo with 50% off. The restaurant was located near hotel lobby which i think is not great and dont have the ambience of hotel buffet. limited food variety and slow refill, especially on my favourite sashimi and small portion upon request.Service was ok attentive and clearing plate fast.Most likely wont be back again
4
A wide assortment of food here! Especially like the chicken satay. Fresh oysters, prawns and sashimi available. Came in a group of 24, young and old. Everyone was happy with the great variety of food. Unfortunately for me, I had a bad bout of diarrhoea after the buffet but everyone else was fine. Suspected it could be the raw sashimi and oysters I had. But anyhow, I would still give a thumbs up for the food
5
Had our dinner there last thursday and enjoyed the experience a lot. There were so much to choose from and all the dishes are delicious. Seafood are fresh specially the oysters. Service was tip top, (had a great dining experience being served by Ms. Clarissa) plus you can also enjoy the live band entertainment from the nearby bar/lounge. We highly recommend this place
4
Good service and food. Great atmosphere and wide range of food items. Will surely promote the offer to friends and family.
5
Nice foods clean place... Nice stuffs... everything are so
Cool thank you... will be
Come again thank.
4
Great food selection.
Lunch wise is without oysters and snow crab legs.
If there is any promotion to come by, i will highly recommend to head straight for dinner. Will come again with promotions.
3
Refills only upon request. Not much initiative.
Kept the food way before closing time, should have the full spread of food as customers are still eating.
4
The seafood is very fresh,only dessert part not much cake can choice. When we ask for 2pontion the salmon, feel the staff not able understand what is 2 pontion feel abit disappointed
4
Dinner range is wider than lunch range with huge crab legs and nice oysters! Worth the 1-for-1 buffet promotion from Chope!
4
Good ambience, good spread of foods and good services. Ideal place for meeting up with friends. Will visit again.
4
Good variety of food and service was good. Dirty plates were removed quickly. However coffee machine failed at the close of the buffet as it gave lukewarm coffee.
5
my husband is always saying that the oysters in SG aren't as fresh as the ones in european countries. we thought the level of seafood freshness would be quite mediocre as expected of most buffets, but lo and behold, it was pretty amazing!! oysters were comparable to the freshly-caught ones in tasted in scotland!!also, first time eating a nicely-cooked salmon at a buffet (usually buffets overcook the salmon making them dry)
2
It was a 2 times a week buffet lunch eat but the standard and quality is nowhere near the standard previously. What you get for lunch is roast beef and sashimi that’s worth eating. The dessert has nothing much to offer. Not recommended to eat there if you think you’re going to get your money’s wort
3
Food Capital offers a wide selections of food ranging from appetisers to desserts. However, it may be an ideal place to dine if you are not someone who is into fried food.
4
Food was great. Good ambiance. However, can have more variety of food and the price is on a high end.
4
The selection was limited compared to other mega buffet. overall quality is above average but the cost can be steep, if not for the 1 for 1 offer for the buffet
5
Went for the 1 for 1 promotion. Snow crab and oyster very flash. Choices of cooked food not much. But given for the price for 1 for 1 is value for money.
4
My Friend and I had a great yummilious fresh seafoodspread dinner . The seafood were very fresh and the spread was very good from the cold crabs , prawns oysters . The taste of freshly made creeps with the green tea and sesame flavoured ice cream were so good . Hope this spread will be repeated so that we can enjoy again 
5
Fresh Big Juicy Oysters , Big Fresh Prawns , Snowcrab Sweet Fresh Claws + Meaty Crab Legs as well as Sushi and Sashimi ...Ice Cream :Yam ,Sesame and Green Tea Fill up Tastebuds lingering onnn.....Chicken is Juicy and Taste Superb ...We Enjoy All Night Out as Diners and will defintely Share with our Friends of Our Memories Moments of the Excellent Service from the Teamwork given to us ! HAPPY in Sharing our Experience and Do Keep it up 
4
Brought my staff of 10 to dinner at Food Capital, and all of them were very happy at the variety of food. Most glad was the single serving of wine/beer that comes with the dinner. Adds to the festive and celebrative mood. Of course, what tops it all was the 1 for 1 offer. Thanks
4
A good enough spread with oysters, Alaskan crab, a limited selection of sashimi/sushi, roasts and cooked dishes (notably lacking in vegetable dishes overall) for an international buffet at the lobby of a Millenia Hotel - but not impressive for the full price. Look out for 1-for-1 promotion on weekdays which amps up the value considerably
4
They have a wide international spread of food from Indian, Japanese to Chinese food. I like the Japanese prawn fritters which they deep fried on the spot.But was disappointed when I was expecting to have Alaskan crab, oysters and crab which shown in their advertising in Chope turn out the Buffett Do Not have these foods at all
3
The taste was alright with very limited variety. Perhaps it's due to the Japanese fest they were having, there weren't any BBQ station nor prawn mee / laksa available. For the seafood, there was only snow crab legs, oysters, prawns, la la and mussels. No scallops / slipper lobsters to be found. I wouldnt find it value for money (despite it being 1-for-1 @$85++). Highly doubt I'd be back. Nonetheless, service was not too bad
4
The service crew are helpful and attentive. Food is good but deserts can have more variety. Overall environment is comfortable. The hotel is also easily accessible.
5
This is a much better than the previous Cafe Brio. The ambience and food choices have improved vastly. The staff were also friendly and efficient. Good for families with kids and elderly. Try their black sesame pancake with black sesame ice cream if you can.
5
My family enjoyed very much with the varieties of food and the service rendered. There was also a live singing performance which I personally enjoyed the most.
4
Atmosphere was good, but not much food variety. Quality of food is only slightly above average.
However considering it was $58++ 1 for 1, it was acceptable
4
The food there was great, the oyster and all other seafood was very fresh. Raw salmon was served freshly as well. The variety of the food was good, organized well. Would definitely go there again.
1
As a M&C hotel with lunch buffet priced at $58++ for the quality and spread offered, it's a complete let down. Types of food item placed on the tables should not be anything worse off just because customers are enticed to the 1-for-1 promotion.
3
Nice ambience and service staffs were friendly. Food were fresh and tasty specially the seafood but overall variety were limited particularly the desserts.
1
Food variety very limited and what was available was mostly below average. Food replenishment is slow and/or rather reactive (you have to ask for it to be refilled). Sushi was so petite in size that u can't even make out what fillings or ingredients were in it. Anyway, it's definitely a first time cum last time
4
The Chope 1 for 1 offer was too good to refuse. Excellent variety of food especially the seafood. I particularly like that there wasn't alot of staples and had more dishes. The tables were also suitably spaced apart so even though the restaurant was full, it did not feel noisy. The live music from the bar also added to the ambience.
5
We were at the Food Capital last night and celebrated my son's 11th Birthday there. It was our first time at the Food Capital since its last renovation, the service was great and we were always greeted with smiles by the service staff both at the food counters and floor. The ambience was nice and relaxing at the same time. Overall experience was excellent. My son had a wonderful birthday dinner last night and the night ended with a really nice appetizing birthday cake compliments from the hotel for my son's birthday
3
Average, reasonable food but poor quality desserts. Service was also inattentive, many staff standing in pairs talking instead of manning their stations. Took ages to catch their attention. Cakes not replenished at 9pm even though buffet till 10.
5
good service
nice food and condition .
best place to have dinner with family and others .
food caital
2
Variety very limited and food not really very appetizing, should bring back local food such as Satay/Laksa/etc, also fruit section very limited
4
The seafood is fresh here. The seafood on ice Selection is ok. You can enjoy prawns, snow crab legs, oysters. 1-1 is worth the price.
5
Food is great, and price is good! Went with a total of 6 pax but paying 3! My friends enjoyed it alot too
4
Went to try given its 1-for-1 promotion with UOB cards. Wide range of food. Fresh prawns and mussels. No crabs available for lunch though :/ but the rest of the food are generally good. Worth $30+/pax!
3
Located at the ground floor of Grand Copthorne Waterfront Hotel, Food Capital has about a little bit of each cuisine. Like for instance, they have 2 cheese selections, a couple of seafood, a bit of Japanese food, some desserts, a bit of local food, and some salad. In terms of taste, it is about average to slightly above average
3
Went because of a 1-for-1 deal with Chope. As we were an odd numbered group this ended up, with tax and charges, at $50 per person for a Saturday lunch. The spread had a large Japanese station with tempura, sushi and sashimi. Other than the prawn tempura, the rest of it was mediocre. The western meats section had a roast beef, roast chicken, veal, some kind of seafood stew, sausages and sides, and a watered down mushroom soup. Of these the best was the veal which was tender. More impressive was the Indian food section with some curries, dhal, roti prata, biryani rice and a whole roasted goat. The Chinese food section was also average, with a watered down chili crab, some decent chicken rice and a rom yum noodle station (tasty, but I was disappointed it was not laksa). Desserts were disappointing other than some delicious strawberries at the chocolate fountain, and cheeses were even more lackluster. I will probably not go back
4
Brought my family to try this for the first time. There were some nice dishes but not very impressive because I have eaten better. Table was too small but the service staff were always there to clear it once you are done. Would recommend people to try it if there was another promotion.
4
(+) I'd recommend Food Capital's buffet if you like oysters/cold prawns/snow crab legs. (+) Very cosy ambience and amazing live singer doing jazz/soul renditions of classic numbers. (+) Attentive and friendly wait staff.(-) The roast/grill selection is limited, looked unappealing and barely edible. (-) Where are the chilli crab and ovenbaked salmon as advertised?(-) Very bad service attitude from the impolite chefs in the centre island. No eye contact and glared rudely as you take your food. Worst i have seen at any buffet.>> Overall 7/10 based on a 1-for-1 deal offered by Chope
5
Loved the fresh salmon, crab and oysters. The buffet also offers a great variety of meat. Will come back again!
3
Visited during weekends. I feel that he lunch buffet food selection was little and the taste of the food was average. Value for me only if it's 1 for 1.
5
Worth the price paid, thumbs up for the great service and there was a complimentary wine/beer/juices on the night I went. Ambience was really wonderful with the live band and most importantly, good food!
3
Dinner menu was not as sumptuous as lunch. Quite a few selection were missing. For example roast meat was not seen.
3
Food choices , nothing exciting. Even dessert has very limited choices. There are other buffets places that are more worth it.
5
We have been to Food Capital on more than a couple of occasions and it is definitely one of the most value for money buffets around the town area. If seafood is your thing, then the selection here even on a weekday night will be more than adequate to satisfy your cravings with its ample selection of snow crab legs, oysters (that are topped up regularly compared to lesser restaurants we have been to) among others. Being regular buffet diners who have patronised other prominent buffet outlets like Shangri-la's The Line and Marriott Cafe, we only chanced upon this gem of a place in August and since then we have been here at least 4-5 times in the last few months. The ambience is also good with its high ceiling and widely spaced seats thus all in all, it makes for a great night out for either a family gathering or a corporate dinner
5
We had our lunch at food capital last saturday and we were amazed by the ambience of the place.food selection was great especially the roasted whole lamb. Desserts were delectable. Staff were very friendly swift and always smiling. Franklin is approachable and very attentive to request. We will recommend this place to our friends for them to try
5
Had a great dining experience at food capital last wed, the food variety was okay only but the service staff there is what people would go for. Big thanks to Dharwin, Suyeon and Anna for their good service provided always being attentive and have a smile on their face when clearing of plates :) Would love to go back there once more when there is discount again!
5
Great service, friendly staff.Ambience is great, live band music sets the mood for eating and chatter.Beef was raw, bloody.5 stars on service, commendations on dharwin, anna and su yeon for their friendliness to the guests tonight.Managers on the floor were helping out with the staff, great teamwork.Desserts were delicious

Just went for the dinner buffet yesterday (5-10-2017) at around 7.45pm. The restaurant's ambience was quite good as there was a live singing performance just beside the hotel bar and if you chose the seat nearer to the bar or the lobby area you could actually watch the singer in action. Anyway, our seat was at the "back" but you could still hear the singer singing as it was broadcast through their speakers. The first impression of the buffet spread was "what? that's it?" as the layout of the food was in a circular pattern with a small island in the centre serving Japanese food, dessert and fruits. I was a little disappointed at the limited choices of foods they had provided. Maybe this was due to the space constraint which affect the variety of food they can serve. Nevertheless, the food quality was acceptable and the food I personally like was the beef stew and baked salmon. The oyster was fresh but not to my liking as it was more creamy type and I prefer more springy. The other thing worth highlight is the dessert, the choices of dessert was kind of pathetic (maybe just 3 to 4 types of cakes). I must give credit to the services of the staff as they were attentive, short respond time serve with a smile and politeness. Overall, I think it was over-price with the food they serve. There is definitely a better buffet restaurant in Singapore with the same price tag
5
Good service and valuable food.worth it for one for one uob discount. Good and nice food. Read a number of negative feedback but to my surprise is really a good dining place
3
That was not the main gripe..the restaurant was nonchalant when informed. We shall report this matter
to the Ministry of Environment, Singapore
3
The environment was good but the variety of food are limited. Is definitely worth a try if there is credit promotion.
3
Sorry even at $79++ for two (1-1), we felt that it was barely worth it. You still get your usual sashimi, shrimp, oyster, roast beef etc. Dessert table was rather weak to me. Service was attentive. Nice and cosy environment after the refurbishment.
3
Had a family dinner on Sat.
We like the waterfront location, nice tall glass window and some food items. Oh, and the durians.
However there was not many food choices, and most were hawker food which may not be that appealing for locals.
5
Great place for gathering.
Splendid choices of food varieties.
Passionate chefs & excellent services.
Chefs were attentive giving us a great dining experience.
Will definitely visit again.

We had a birthday dinner celebration at Food Capital, Grand Copthorne Waterfront Hotel's refurbished restaurant on 15 September, a Friday evening. The warm welcome upon our arrival as well as the modern decor and vibrant ambience provided positive vibes, with the restaurant abuzz with diners everywhere. It was a very good first impression for us. As live music played in the background, my friend thanked me for choosing the place, especially as we checked out the various manned stations - Rotisserie, Seafood on Ice, Japanese, Chinese, Tandoor (Indian) and Asian Kitchen stations etc.We were pleasantly surprised to find the Rotisserie station serving the full range of roast beef, lamb and chicken, in addition to baked salmon. There were also the usual suspects like oysters, mussels, tiger prawns, salmon and tuna sashimi, as well as local/Singaporean favourites such as roast duck, chicken rice, laksa, satay and curry. I also spotted generous portions of giant snow crab legs on display. Unfortunately we didn't have the capacity to try everything but highlights/must-haves for us were the roast beef, roast lamb, baked salmon, sashimi and tiger prawns. Do note that as there were many equally enthusiastic and ferociously hungry diners forming queues, some items were not replenished quickly enough (e.g. oysters). Also, even though the stated opening hours are from 6.30pm to 10.30pm (I checked), fresh plates were much harder to locate as the crowd began to thin out only around 9pm, with some stations even looking like they were starting to wind down, something I've never ever experienced at other hotel buffets.By the time we approached the dessert station (only just past 9pm), there was nothing much left, with the limited selection not looking very appetising anyway. We did however have a couple of scoops of ice cream.Overall, it was a memorable evening, with all the positives already mentioned. Another highlight was the friendly and attentive service from the staff, especially a young waiter called JC Tan. Remembering it was my friend's birthday, he very obligingly appeared later with a nice slice of cheesecake - lit candle perched atop - and sang "Happy Birthday" together with a Chinese waitress who sportingly tagged along. My friend was tickled pink!The dinner buffet costs S$74++/£41++/USD54++ per person (Mon - Thurs) and S$79++/£43++/USD58++ per person (Fri - Sun). However there is a value-for-money one-for-one UOB card offer, so to all UOB card holders or those with friends with the card: strike while the iron is hot
3
Went for lunch buffet at food capital on a friday. Only some dishes were satisfying, such as roasted vegetables and laksa as well as indian curry. The Japanese section was forgettable, sashimi so-so. Prawns werent as fresh as we hoped.Dessert section was really limited! I'd say makan@jen is much better for dessert comparatively. Salad bar was quite sad. Chicken rice chicken not flavourful.If not for the 1 for 1 deal, i'd say its totally not worth the 58++ per person. There was no 1 for 1 for kids' price at 29+
4
We celebrate my Friends birthday at the Food Capitals . And the Chef Max are very friendly and kindly to served me and my friends. And the service staff Jc Tan also served us a birthday cakes with a special candle for my friends birthday , she was very surprise when she saw a big candle there .Thanks Jc Tan !will come back again !
5
My friend yesterday celebrate birthday at FOOD CAPITALthis is my second time for dinner at Grand Copthorne Waterfront1st time is having Durian Buffer, is super delicious durian feast...Buffet spread is excellent , freshness of the seafood, thoughtful menu (traditional Chinese soup) , local food, Definitely going back for food. Credit card promotions Super awesome.Restaurant service excellent especially JC TAN and Chef Max LimService staff are very friendly and helpful..
5
Just stayed in the hotel this week and breakfast here is the main event, fantastic choice in the buffet...Enjoy lah!
4
Food was average. Highlight of the buffet dinner is the durian and the local tibits. Nice atmosphere with live music.
5
Brought my family to Food Capital for dinner on 8 Aug 2017.
Good spread of food and most importantly there are DURIANS...
And Chope promotion "1-for-1" makes it a better deal...
5
Just visited the hotel and was surprised they had a refurbishment. Loved the cosy and relaxed ambience! Modern looks with friendly staff. There was even a live band with a beautiful melodious singer. The new Food Capital restaurant is located just right beside the lobby and there was a wide spread of international and local cuisine. The sashimi was very fresh and what was most interesting is that there was even a durian station outdoors with gloves provided (a thoughtful gesture ). You could just sit right beside the river to enjoy the cool breeze and enjoy feasting on the King and Queen of fruits. There was also a very interesting fresh coconut chendol dessert which everyone should not miss
5
I had a family gathering at food capital last Sunday and the ambience was awesome.The food choices were great and lastly the durian were immeasurable.We really had a great time enjoying every minutes of our time at the buffet restaurant.Highly recommended to anyone looking for a great outing.Cheer
5
Had dinner at Food Capital last Saturday to try the Heritage Feast buffet and the food was up to our expectation. Special mention to Jia Yee who informed us about the discounts available and also accommodated to our request for a sofa seat despite it being a busy night. Would definitely recommend my friends to come here 
5
A buffet restaurant I had visited last week. Name with Food capital. They serving hawker buffet. Pay a visit if you are hawker lover. You will find Chilli crab, Indian rojak, Singapore rojak, muah Chi, even ice cream stick. I got the small packet mimi noddles or mamee noddles. That's what I use to have when I small. And durian but That's not my Favourite, I prefer the Chilli crab.. and their signature laksa. Friendly service . A great dinner I can said that
5
Have been repeating my trips ever so often at Food Capital with local friends and visitors from abroad.Never ever disappointed. The spread is extensive and impressive. Set up and ambience is pleasing and spacious too. Needless to say, service staff ever so polite and attentive.My friends and I simply love the wide range from local to international such as sushi; tempura; Indian spread; fresh seafood; cold cuts; yummy yummy desserts cannot missed. Too much to describe.. Just go and try it out.Car park is ample and complimentary parking given for every S$100/- spending..
4
There was some National Day promotion going on, but seems more an excuse to jack up the price. Even after a massive 50% discount the price was still massive... more than $50 pax. The food was delicious, the seafood fresh and the local delights were ok, there was a durian station serving sweet custard-like durians, but price wise was still slightly overpriced in my view.
5
We don't normally enjoy buffets but we thought that we would give this a try. We were surprised at the quality, freshness and range of choice. There were fresh oysters, clams and prawns as well as a huge range of Chinese, Malaysian, Japanese and Singaporean dishes. On top of that was roast dinner (gave that a miss), Indian dishes, salads, cheeses and too many more things to mention, never mind the cakes, sweets and chocolate fountain. The kids loved getting up and helping themselves and the secret was little and often! Enjoy it all. They were even serving fresh durian fruit outside. It was the first time we had tried it and I had to agree with a fellow diner who said it tasted like onion custard ;-)Great restaurant with friendly service. Something different and fun
3
Especially Sashimi was given just 3/4 slice per guest. The food corners are not much, Chinese, Indian, Roast and Japanese Sashimi. The Laksa is the best taste. The desert is as usual. No much outstanding food from 5stars hotel restaurant.
4
Restaurant ambience was great with live singing in the background. Good variety was not so much but quality of food was not bad! Desserts selection rather limited.
4
Really have nice and good food. Especially the Long leg crab meat and the laksa which taste exceptionally good. There a staff I think by the name of Steven, very polite and very prompt in clearing whatever leftover on our tables.
5
this is my favourite place to have dinner with my friends. there is so many variety that i can choose. we love food capital very much. we will be back for the food soon.
1
Sashimi was not sliced nor laid nicely on plate before handing to customers. Food was without label.
4
Recently we had a Thank you dinner held at the Food Capital , Grand Copthorne Waterfront Hotel. The food prepared by their Chef Madeline Tan and her team was just fantastic. It was a gastronomical experience, bringing in all the different local tastes of Singapore into one location. The desert is a must-try - the chendol and coconut ice cream served in a coconut. Special mention also goes out to Restaurant Manager Catherine Chong and her team for their service par excellence. Definitely well recommended. Thanks !!!! Robin Ta
4
Been here twice. Some choices of seafood & japanese food.there arenot many vegetarian food except indian curry, veg stir fry which isnot look interesting,baked wedges potatoes.there are some variety of cheese.i love their cakes although its size is too small. This time i saw some sweets from my childhood on their dinner buffet. Felt excited that night.Please improve ur vegetarian food
2
Ambience was good but not quite so for customer service and food when compared with its predecessor Cafe Brio.1. Limited choices of food2. Some of the food was not kept warm, e.g grilled section.3. Cutlery not promptly replenished4. Staff are not well trained and proactive.
5
This is one of my favorite place to have dinner with my family and friends, fresh crab and oyster is the best, cozy environment and the great service from each of the staffs will make you felt we had dinner at home, We have thanks for Steven Woo who take good care of our dinner last night, the best staff amount the team
4
Food variety is good with fresh crab legs and prawns. Salmon and tuna sashimi were alright. Other options include japanese tempura prawn and vegetables, roast beef, lamb and chicken, indian cuisine, laksa, cheese and crackers and desserts with chocolate fondue and ice cream.Service staff are very friendly and helpful. Price is reasonable and with 50% discount, it's value for money
5
Its a good lunch despite UOB 1 for 1 deal. Good food variety and quality taste too. Thumbs up!
Will go back to Food Capital again 😊
4
Food good place good.... include sashimi , tampora prawn , roast beef... good selection of desert and cakes
5
There are so many fresh seafood like crab, salmon and oysters~ If you like seafood I can say that this Food capital is top of top! Furthermore, the Mr. Dars's service was awesome~ If we need some napkins or cutlerys he bring those of things immediately. I appreciate with your careful service~ thank u!
5
All food are really tasty n fresh. Many kinds of foods displayed so nicely. And it is possible to enjoy directly especially salmon. And Mr. Dars are so kind and sweet. While enjoying food w my friends, i could hear nice live music. It make me feel so good as well. Go for it! And just enjoy. Im sure that everybody are able to have a nice time
3
Ambience was good, but food was just average. I love my sashimi smooth and slightly springy, but the sashimi on that day tasted too soft for my liking. Oysters finished too fast and replenishing was slow. For the spread on that day, $79++ for lunch was overpriced.The waiters were friendly and cleared the plates fast. Staff at the various stations were also friendly and attentive.On the whole, service was good, but buffet spread can be improved
5
Food: Fresh Oysters, Chilli Crab, Black Pepper Prawn, Snow Crab legs are all available when we visited. They also have at least 3 types of sashimi, salmon, tuna, and the other white fish thing - not the best but will do. The slices are a bit off still with the brown part of the fish in there. They also have the baked salmon which was very nice. If you like meat, they have roasted beef, sausages, sheep/mutton, chicken and other stuffs. A lot of desserts, bread, cheeses, and salads. Location - accessible via public transportation. Dining Area - crowded which is a positive sign that food is good! Service - very good, friendly attentive staffs. Overall: Excellent spread for a lunch buffet. This is our second visit and will definitely go back in the future. Hole in the wallet - For 2 pax - 77sgd nett using a card 1-for-1 deal
5
I love the service at the food at food capital. Their food is tasty. love their executive Chef Madeline Tan for the special dishes that she has introduced for the daily special for the buffet. Her creativity ie kimchi risotto, cheese sausages etc..Thank you Madeline for your leadership and Your team for such sincere service.Very server for the buffet is so friendly and patient inspire of the many requests of the patrons. Excellent service!

This buffet restaurant has policies to ration food:1) We requested for salmon belly and were told to come back in 20 mins. (There's salmon belly in the chiller and it's my turn in the queue)2) Only 1 pair of snow crab scissors provided per group/table, regardless of group size. It's unhygenic and delays the feasting of the crab legs. It is also extremely difficult to request for more scissors, consider BYO? (Sullen face from the manager)3) It's a long wait for the oysters once it's gone. It's not constantly shucked and served. 4) The waitress has very bad table manners. She crossed over me to clear the plates when i'm still eating. She's also very eager to clear half done plates.Despite the sub-standard service, the food is fresh and taste good. I like the laksa with lots of cockles, roast lamb and beef etc.Despite the newly renovated restaurant, your terrible service and food rationing policies pissed off customers! I'm glad we went with a 50% discount promotion. Please improve your service

We, a group of 8 pax, were there for buffet dinner. @ Sashimi counter- 4 very thin slices each serving and counter staff was displeased when asked for more (of course no wastage of food). At one point, he raised his voice at my friend to place the plate at counter for him to place the sashimi@ Ice Cream counter - bad attitude@ Dessert - 1st plate of different kueh kueh has only 2pcs of kueh lapis left. We noticed that there is a 2nd plate which has all the different kuehs, and we wanted to try the ondeh ondeh from the 2nd plate. We were rudely refused by the counter staff that we can only take from the 2nd plate after the 1st plate kueh has all been taken

Huge selection and variety of food to suit all ages. Atmosphere is really cosy. Service is good.
Great value for money.

The food was delicious and fantastic and the customer service excellence standard. I will bring my family along.

Food not bad but not much choices, beside the seafood you should try the Laksa, their seafood quiet fresh, refill are fast. Good to have when there is promotion with discount.

How lovely to have wonderful live music from the bar throughout our meal! Selection was good, enjoyed the snow crabs and chicken rice! Will be back!! Plate clearing can be improved on though! Go for the 50% deal!
2
Satisfied with the environment for gathering. Just feeling the taste of food just normal from our overall opinion. The services is not good enough if for hotel buffet standard. Hope it may improve for the future

Good food And good spread! Would reccomend friends to visit this place. Service was okay too. Try it

Went on a Sunday night, was very packed. Food selection isn't a lot for the price you pay, but the foods were delicious :) Front greeting staff were pleasant, but some waiters looked like they needed more training. Otherwise an ok experience, but had better buffet elsewhere :

Certainly not the best buffet in Singapore, but for the price (1/2 or 1/3 of some really expensive (comparable?) 5* hotels) it is really very acceptable. More expensive on Saturday lunch when crab legs are on offer, we could only book for Sunday (for the weekend wanted) - which had oysters which we were told were also only on the Saturday, and otherwise good seafood, and a wide range of other food. Kids loved the chocolate fountain, and nice waterside walk outside afterwards.Good range of vegetarian - mainly in the Indian section - and also fair desserts. As noted, not the best but when factored for price very satisfied. Having said that, like all Singapore buffets went on a 1-4-1 offer with a credit card as full price would be too much to pay
4
Nice selection of food. Great ambience. I particularly enjoyed the chilled prawns, barbecue pork ribs, osso bucco, pappadams with mango chutney and ice cream. First time time seeing a higher end Dilma tea selection too! The peppermint tea was fantastic. Exceptional value with current 1-for-1 promotion with UOB credit cards.

My family went for Saturday buffet lunch in April 2017. Disappointed without slipper lobster & baked scallop & few dishes of food & cakes were "disappeared" though stated in the menu 66 feasts, based on Summer Loves To Eat Blog. (It's understandable that food subject to change without notice). Went 3 rounds for tempura prawns but still couldn't get any. Finally, I had 3 pcs of prawns when requested the staff who fried the prawns to reserve for me. Cakes limited - only red velvet cake & brownie. Cooked food should add more few dishes
4
a good selection of quality food. The beef steak thick and suculent. The oysters canadian are not thin suficiently thick and juicy. the deserts were great. will certainly be back
5
Service is excellent and food replenished promptly. I love the sashimi and oysters which is very fresh. 50% discount is an added plus point!
1
I think the standard dropped after the renovation. Seating was not comfortable and food was one of the worsts I've ever eaten at a buffet restaurant in a hotel.
5
Service was fantastic.
Food was amazing.
Music was soothing and calm.
Atmosphere was pristine and professional.
Great experience.
3
A day when they are under staff and food was just average. Laksa was long queue and the line was messy.
4
The discount given to stay-in guests for the buffet dinner makes it great value for money. I don't know how long the offer lasts though. I ate in April 2017

We were not told there was a price hike in the regular buffet and it's not even mother's day! Don't think that was very good marketing or sale tactic. I think they should at least tell people at the door that they know its going to be a price hike or display the amount prominently. We had a rude shock when the bill came and the buffet was nothing special from the ordinary one which we used to have. It's a cheap ploy at worst and bad customer service at best. Not coming or getting friends here again
4
I went in for their special Mother's Day buffet. The spread was delicious. I most enjoyed the fresh sashimi and the incredible roast beef. The snow crab legs and prawns weren't as fresh as I expected but they weren't terrible. I loved the selection of nonya kuehs and cakes. There was a live band and a special carnation for each mummy which I thought was a really sweet touch.
4
Booked this place for mothers day. My mom loved it. They had just the right balance of quality seafood and meats. The Japanese section was a little lacking however the huge endless supply of snow crab legs more than made up for it! Definitely worth a try.

Dined at Food Capital on 1 May and 6 May 2017. My family & I are always impressed by the dishes served at the Buffet table. The dining experience is memorable as the variety is sufficient to satisfy every member of the family. The new addition of mashed potatoes and grilled chicken cheese sausages was a welcome surprise - it is upon biting into the sausage that you discover the cheese!Chef David Toh and Magdalene Tan are always on the ground to ensure food served is absolutely wonderful, from preparation to presentation. Their diligence and dedication demonstrated during our visits, their ability to perform in spite of their busy schedule is a significant contribution to your organization's success.Keep up the good work

Good services and good food. Seafood were fresh especially the cold prawns.
Staffs are friendly and will clear your tables as when needed.
4
The hotel think is newly renovated. Good amostphere n we enjoyed our lunch there. Variety of food , great service for all the staffs served with smiling face!
5
They have food catered for all, from local, Korean, American and Chinese. Very authentic and fresh. I guess I'm a foodie by nature, I can tell you exactly what's excellent to mediocre!! And this is a definite 10 stars!!!
5
An international cuisine seafood buffet is a great choice for both breakfast and dinner. Friendly service too.
5
Great service by Mark and his team. Food spread was extensive and of high quality. Loved the fact that they had takeaway cups for coffee..
1
They confirmed your reservation for $52 1-for-1 promotion but they charged you $88 without notifying you. When queried after 3 phone calls and 2 emails, they replied after one week saying oh we are sorry but $88 is the price. And we are talking about 18 of us which is a lot of money. The service staff behind counters were unfriendly as well

Came here for a buffet lunch due to good reviews after the recent renovation to the restaurant. The selection of food is of a good quality but the range of food is somewhat limited. For sashimi, they have 2 choices which is salmon and yellow tail. The cold prawns being served is fresh and tasty. For the hot selection, there are roast beef, laksa and chicken rice which is pretty good. There is also a pasta section where the staff will serve either tomato or white base pasta. For the satay section, the chicken is more tasty than the beef as the beef seems somewhat over-cooked, however the satay sauce is done very well with a right mix of peanuts in it. As for the dessert selection, it is rather disappointing as the cakes available are very limited. Do keep some room for the ice-cream, especially the chocolate and yam

Staying in the beautiful Grand Copthorne hotel we were here early each morning and so enjoyed the buffet breakfast. Spent time just wandering round seeing all on offer and enjoying trying old favourites and trying new ones! Scrummy HOT made to order scrambled eggs on toast! Great to take our coffee - and pastries! - outside to a table by the river. Best Singapore breakfasts ever!!!

25 March 2017 Saturday. Had dinner at Food Capital but was surprised to find that there were more than 250+ patrons that night. This is due to a 1-1 free buffet promotion with Eatigo (a table reservation website with attractive discounts). Service was therefore compromised due to: 1. shortage of staff, used plates not cleared, had to stack them up high to make space2. buffet spread not replenished, many dishes were empty, had to inform staff but it still took them a while3. queues were forming at each station, creating a human jam and had to wait longer than usual for each dish4. Told some staff & even the managers about the situation from a patron's point of view but they were oblivious and were even proud to say that "well, at least we achieved our target

After a recent renovation, Food Capital, the new buffet restaurant at Grand Copthorne Waterfront hotel looked contemporary and inviting.The hotel had a vibrant decor and cheerful feel with its modern huge cloud-like lighting.Upon walking into the lobby from the carpark, the hotel had a pleasant aromatherapy scent which was welcoming.The hotel restaurant has a decent and adequate selection of both local / Asian and western cuisine, to whet the appetites of all who may veer towards either type of cuisine.While limited in choices, their food was of good quality and tasty. They even had roast turkey and truffle mash potatoe during their New Year Eve lunch buffet.Do try their delectable local food such as chinese style soup, roast meats and satay etc. Their Japanese sashimi and tempura were also delicious.For dessert, there was a good array of christmas cakes and stollen, chocolate fountain and the ever-loved ice cream.There is a good gourmet coffee machine, with a selection of popular tea bag flavours, which are complimentary.Service is efficient and friendly.A tad pricier on a public holiday, but still recommended for a nice family gathering or celebration meal.They had a nice play area with a bouncy castle and slide for kids, and even a table soccer, for some playtime after a satisfying meal.Remember to collect your complimentary carpark coupon at the restaurant counter, as parking is expensive.Helen Singapor

Food Capital is the best in town,the service is very attentive to details.Food spread are very good and a lot of choices..It is a must to experience!!!
5
Breakfast included a great variety of foods, Indian, Chinese, as well as Western dishes. The quality was good. It was too crowded and moving about was hard.
4
Food capital is now what was the old Brio and along with the revamped hotel, the buffet has also greatly improved. The whole atmosphere with the integrated ground floor dining concept has given the hotel a younger feel and the food on offer was lovely
4
Enjoyed both Breakfast and Dinner at Food Capital. Offers an excellent selection of dishes from all over the world, served buffet style with live cooking stations and efficient staff.

Visited on a Thursday night buffet dinner with my husband.. Had a Hainanese boiled chicken drumstick ordered at chicken rice station, but disappointed and discarded 98% of it because the meat was too red-ish and uncooked. Ika meat was very mushy and rubbery, kept chewing but can't bring myself to swallow it and spilt out in the end. Alaska crab leg was not bad actually... Also felt that they should at least cover the utensils / drinking cup which was placed for outdoor dinning, as dust can just land on them and diners might not take note / wipe them before using if sitting outdoor (just a thought).Overall, I felt the buffet was not worth $70++ per pax, variety not so much. Somehow disappointed
4
Boxing day dinner with family and friends was a revelation. There are a variety of cuisines on offer. Chinese, japanese, indian and Italian. There was a lot of seafood on offer and that was what I went for. Lovely juicy oysters followed by King prawns and then tuna and Octopus shashimi and more, The chili crab was fantastic. i finshed the lot with a little pasta with marinara sauce. in no way could i fault anything. service was great and great value at the price
5
Very pleased with the food quality, service, and price. We dined there today and enjoyed a beautiful brunch- lots of seafood, beef, lamb and turkey. Beautiful salads and sushi bar too. The tempura was excellent and scallops- delicious! I thought the price was excellent for what you receive and the service was wonderful. The hotel has recently been renovated and is contemporary and the view of the water is lovely. We highly recommend and will go back!

From its thin-crust italian fare (pasta, pizza etc) to fresh seafood like lobster, crab and crayfish or oyster...I have nothing to pick on themThe highlight of the large variety of food comes with their tender and juicy grilled beef!!!!!!!!!succulent to be on par of some of the expensive beef houses in SingaporeI have never believed that Michelin-starred options are truly good, hence this restaurant though w/o a Michelin star could earn itself an award of no poor or terrible rating! (at this moment, not even an "average")From the little thing like satay sauce, and other condiments, as well as sausages, it is fresh and they took effort in preparing them!Its Foie gras (previously tasted their 2nd level Pontini) is still maintaining its standardsAfter the meal, you will understand how and why it has successfully changed from Cafe Brio to Food capital yet able to maintain its standards (it is about the consistency) and it is very affordable!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! (not even S$100 pax after all taxes and charges are calculated on a xmas day: Santa moves around with little sweet to give us surprise...)However, do avoid the window seat esp u know u r having meals at lunch time....Service wise: there is definitely room for improvement to turn it to world class capital

@TheKuoKnowsCopthorne Waterfront deserves a big round of applause for reburshing its buffet restaurant. While Brio was good in its day, it had started to look a little white around the gills.But the new Food Capital can now hold its own against some of Singapore's top international all-you-can eat buffets. The layout is much friendlier, the colour scheme considerably warmer and even the foods seems to taste better.The Japanese section looks mightily attractive. The Sashimi counter is well stocked with the usual suspects. The Tempura is crisp and dry. All that is missing is Yakitori.The Indian section has a good selection of vegetarian and meat dishes. Go easy on the Naan and Chapati, though. With curries that good, who needs to overdose on carbohydrates.Try the Singapore Laksa. It is hawker-stall quality. The Chicken Rice can give the specialists a good run for the their money. And the Satay, when it's available, is pretty awesome, too.The desserts could do with a little bit more effort, though. Not quite enough local sweets, in my opinion.Surely It shouldn't be too difficult to prepare a pan of Red or Green Bean Soup, some Durian Pengat or a tub of Silken Tofu. That could have rounded off the meal, perfectly

This was newly opened in Jun/Jul 2016. I have visited twice. Variety of food was okay. For seafood on ice, they served oysters, sashimi, clams, prawns and snow crabs. Quality and freshness of food is consider okay.They have a good variety of cooked food as well. Laksa, brewed soups, bbq food, spaghetti, etc.Desserts were a good spread. I like their macaroons. Not too sweet.Complimentary car park is provided when you dine here.Place is spacious. Good place for gathering. Enjoy the food while catching up with your friends or colleagues and even relatives.

A great variety of delicious food! I'm already super full eating a little of each 😊 Friendly & attentive staff, a big thumbs up for them! 👍Nice ambience too! I do not mind going again for celebrations!
5
Large range of food type and good service
Best make a reservation in case any disappointment, as it it quite full during the weekend.
Cheers

Breakfast for 2 at Food Capital last weekend was a great "makan" experience. The previous name "Cafe Brio's" was more "glam" sounding but hey, who cares if the food and ambience are great - and they were! Keep it up!
5
I eat here for all my breakfast whenever I stay here, and I must say, the food is not only freshly prepared, the service given is also very attentive and helpful.
5
I came here twice.There is a wide variety of food,especially for seafood lovers.They have Western, Local,Indian,Japanese,and Chinese.There were mini macroons and lollipops today,complete with cakes.There is fondue too,and don't forget the ice cream.You'll be spoilt for choice!
4
Nice food choices, although hot food was barely warm, table cleaning service a bit sluggish. Otherwise good
4
This restuarant offers varieties of food which are very delicious. Seafoods, especially the Alaska crab legs, are great. Indian foods and typical Singaporean BBQ pork and roast duck are the must to try. Indian foods are authentic and worth to try. Service is friendly. If you stay in the hotel nearby, do not bother to go elsewhere

I would to highly compliment restaurant manager Mr. Mohd Ali and his service crew on the outstanding service attitude and food quality. I had experience a small set back in their service attitude, but Mr. Mohd Ali was more than willing to hear me out and quickly took steps to service recovery as such reviewing service lapse with particular staff and ever ready to provide service recovery, which was not my main aim besides just sharing a thought. Other than that food, ambience and variety is superb. Would definitely be doing more visits in the near future. Thank you to the crew of Food Capital, keep it going! - Reen

Had the opportunity to visit Grand Corpthorne Waterfront Hotel after its refurbishment work and I am very impressed with the restaurant, Food Capital in the main lobby.Firstly the ambience made the place very unique, special and a place that I don't mind spending time in. Surprisingly I was taken aback pleasantly by its' ambience and totally forgot about the food part.To make it a perfect visit, the lunch buffet was a good quality spread. From local Chinese, Indian & Malay cuisine to western and high quality Japanese sushi and sashimi. Included in the spread crab legs, prawns, scallop and more.It also has a complete spread of fruits and desserts! Wide range of offering to appease your sweet tooth. Am impressed with the fruits too as mostly we offered whole.This made my business entertainment easy as both the food and surrounding was TOP notch. Consistently bringing out praises from my business partner on both the decor and the food.If I had a dish I wish I could have had more was the curry laksa. Last but not least, the price of $60.00 per person including of taxes is simply very reasonable for the quality of food and a great environment it offers

Whilst staying at the hotel we had an evening meal in the Food Capital. They offer a buffet experience. The selection was excellent as was the quality. Slightly priced on the high side, although I have to admit there were some quality expensive food items on offer. Would highly recommend
