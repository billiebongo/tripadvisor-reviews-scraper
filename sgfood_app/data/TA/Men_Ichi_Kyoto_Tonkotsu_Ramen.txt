The meal would have been more enjoyable if the place was not so warm. I tried the wanton ramen but find it so-so. Place was packed so must be good.

Not bad.. always long q.. finally got to try it. The broth was slightly too saltish. Service not that fast...
Overall ok.

This is in the basement, Japanese food street area. The ramen is good and great value for money. The restaurant is a bit small and usually there is a queue outside. Service is good.

Finally we have some good ramen in JP! It gives free upgrade for the portion as well. I tried the miso based and soya based and I like the latter as it is not so salty

This is my first time to eat ramen and i really love it. The broth was very delicious. We ordered 2 bowls of different flavors. Both were delicious. I couldnt finish my bowl because the serving is large for me. Although i'm full already, i couldnt stop to eat. I really like their ramen. I wish i could eat there again,( I'm on my trip

Was with a colleague for lunch at Men-Ichi. We ordered a set of 1 bowl rice with crab meat omelette and 1 bowl of char siu ramen. The set cost us S$19.90 and it was good value. The rice was soft and the omelette fluffy. The paitan soup for the ramen was really tasty and not too salty. Even their appetizer of salted vegetables were refreshing and the the crispy garlic were free flow

Visited this restaurant for lunch while walking along the Japanese food street at jurong point. The broth was savory and noodles were springy. The only fault I can find is the half egg that comes with my ramen. The yolk was not that fluid as it should be. Other than that, recommended for a good bowl of ramen

Second visit to this restaurant - came back for lunch today, thoroughly enjoyed the Kanitama Ramen - crabmeat and mushroom omelette plus noodles in a tasty broth.Also had lightly fried Chicken Gyoza for entrÃ©e plus some really good condiments - a nice meal.Friendly staff, dishes are hot and served quickly, it is a popular restaurant.Travel out on the MRT to Boon Lay and then downstairs to the Japanese Street in the Jurong Point mall....it's worth the trip

Found this restaurant when I came back to Jurong Point Mall for yesterday.Located in the Japanese food street on the B1 level, table turnover was quick as orders were prepared and presented fresh and hot. Staff were helpful and appeared to enjoy the busy atmosphere.There are sets available as well individual meals and sides. Prices are good.Ordered the Saboro Don - minced pork, egg and rice - the Buta Rosu Yaki - grilled pork loin - both tasty and I thoroughly enjoyed each dish.A good indicator of popularity is a queue at the entrance, if you are at Jurong Point Mall give this place a go
