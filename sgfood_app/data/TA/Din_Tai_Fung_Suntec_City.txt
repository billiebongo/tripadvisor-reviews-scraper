Every time we visit Singapore, we eat at Din Tai Fung. Love this restaurant and their food. Weâ€™ll keep coming back.
5
like all other din tai fungs, their lines were long but it was worth the wait. Food as expected was excellent, service could be better but it doesn't spoil the experience.
5
Nice selection of dim sum and good value for money. Loved the pork and vegetables. Pretty crowded but never waited too long. Jasmine tea is free flow. Highly recommended.
5
Pretty impressive restaurant - must visit. Extremely busy but very efficient, maybe the only inconvenience is small space while sitting at the table, but so very delicious and if you really want to have the best taste of asian cuisine - you must have this stomach feast. BTW the drinks - cocktails were very delicious. Highly recommend
5
We were impressed with both the precision of those making dumplings through the glass window - and the accolades given by the New York Times or some similar publication - so we decided to try this restaurant for ourselves.We had a 15 minute wait until a table was available - and another 15 until our meal was served.We ordered, quite simply, pork and vegetable won-ton soup.Our verdict? Perfect!!We await the day Din Tai Fung comes to East Auckland, New Zealand
5
Din Tai Fung has a outlet in Suntec city mall. Was there for lunch and do not need to Q unlike most other outlets which was great. Order the usual crab meat dumplings, prawn fried rice and fried pork chop. Did not disappoint as the standard remain good! BRTon

The dumplings there are really good. They have some juice inside which is really nice. Not only the dumplings, there is Chinese Fried rice. All of the food there was exemplary. On the other hand, the service of the waiter there is poor. They even spilled hot tea on me. That sounds personal, but every time I go there I hear dishes falling on the floor
5
I was with my family one Saturday November 2017. We ordered lots of dim sum and some rice. Really nice. Food good and well served and everything very clean. We will go back. They have room to improve in the service. Quite mechanical I would say. I recommend the place. Go with time because it is crowded and you will have to queu at lunch
2
After friends had raved about dtf as one of the go to places to eat in Singapore we were disappointed. The girl at the front counter had difficulty with English. Our wait staff didn't explain the ordering process, the food came out in dribs and drabs, was relatively tasteless, they managed to get two of the dishes wrong, and for a snack it was expensive. Not impressed
4
As this is very popular there is a wait - go and get your clipboard and choice list and fill it in as you wait. Watch for your number then you are set to go. Most people seemed to be going for Dumplings so I did too as that is what they are known for and they were delicious and well prepared. I asked for a Tofu dish also but none was available so my choice for vegetarian was a little restricted hence 4 * not 5 *
3
Honestly, most find it tasty and yummy there. But has anyone noticed the amount of meat say inside the dumpling has gotten less comapred to before and compared to DTF in other countries?
4
We regularly visit Din Tai Fung as a family. Kids love it. Dumplings are always fresh. Only they have more pork choices than others.
Its comfort food. Suntec is a busy place, so be prepared to wait.
4
Excellent. A must visit.
Staff were really helpful for those of us attempting to avoid seafood. Great service. Great food.
5
It really is possible: high quality fast food. Excellent Dim Sum and very tasteful Noodle Soup. Not the place for a romantic dinner, but more than good enough for a high quality lunch.
5
Give you sence of healthy food. Not over spcied, not oliy. Beef is cooked well. Fried egg rice and noodles are great. Vegtables are fresh. A bit noisy.
4
I try with every Dintaifung when i went to 1 new country. And you needed to wait from 30~40' everywhere. The first, you need to choose food, reservations and enjoy.I like sauteed vegetables & soy sauce, fried rice. I try dimsum but I do not normally see i
4
Tried the soup dumplings, with crab and pork inside, it was hot and delicious. Had the shrimp cake, thin and crispy but a bit oily.Noodles with shredded pork with spicy sauce , it was very delicious.The restaurant is quite large, but not too many customers at night. Atmosphere is different with the other Din Tai Fung I have been to in Taiwan.Okay all in all
3
We initially ordered 10 pcs of Xiao Long Bao. My friend decided to join us so we ordered another set of 10pcs which was acknowledged by the order taker. She even reconfirmed and repeated 20pcs. When our foods arrived, 30pcs of Xiao Long Bao was served. I told the Chef that we only ordered 20pcs in total. The order taker came back to us and I explained that there's an initial order of 10pcs plus another set of 10pcs, so total of 20pcs. There was a miscommunication I guess but her facial expression was unbelievable. I understand that the restaurant is busy and all the staff are tired but rolling your eyes? Seriously? Anyway, it's a very small issue but not a good impression. In the event that it happened to a rude customer, good luck. The dimsum is not that tasty compared to other din tai fung branches. On a positive note, the restaurant is spacious and they don't over crowd. The fried rice with pork is always the best
5
I've been to Din Tai Fung in China, Taiwan and the US so I don't have much more to say about this. The xiaolongbao was amazing as always. The place was jammed but they were able to seat us quickly. It's great that this place is so close to our Singapore office in Suntec City. The restaurant was clean and bright and the service was quick and efficient.
5
Located in the shopping mall at Suntec City, I didn't expect much of Din Tai Fung on my first visit but wow, was I wrong! The food was of excellent quality (I had steamed pork buns and a chicken and noodle dish). Jasmin tea was only $1 singapore for an unlimited amount. The whole bill was only $18.50 singapore. Excellent value
4
We didnt have to wait (on Tuesday night at around 7pm). The service was very quick, food was excellent and was interesting to see the dumplings prepared in the kitchen.
4
Short on atmosphere, but the food was great. The dumplings are mostly steamed and come in many varieties. There were all wonderful. Made with care in the front of the store and served fresh and hot. Heavenly.
5
Fast, delicious food. Always quality food- such a well oiled service machine. You may need to wait 20mins for a spot- but there's plenty of shops to pop into while waiting. Worth it for the xiao long bao
5
Great dumplings and the like. Service was a bit average but at least they left us alone and didn't badger like in other dim sums.
4
The food lives up to the reputation...especially the dumplings and the hot and sour soup. It does get crowded fast during lunch, but the wait isn't nearly as long as at the Din Tai Fungs in California. Service was OK. Great value!
5
Even though this is a part of the restaurant chain the feeling was great, open kitchen with several cooks preparing dumplings. Big variety of dumplings, pau's and other Chinese dim sum's. Very tasty, hand made and reasonable pricing.
5
Fabulous restaurant. Especially the gyozas with chilli. Loved watching the chefs making the food. The restaurant can be found at several places over Singapore. The one at Suntec was very nice with, as always, good service.
4
The food was great. The dumplings with pork and prawns were out of this world. I liked the decor and the prices were reasonable. But the service was awful. It took forever to get out food, and we never got our beer. We weren't the only ones, there were at least four tables around us at which the patrons were complaining. The service at the chain at the Raffles Centre (about a three minute walk) was much better
5
I love Din Tai Fung - very high quality food and relatively western-palate-friendly (for authentic Chinese/Dim sum).DTF now have many branches in Singapore and more world-wide. While the experience varies from location to location they are generally similar in menu and service (expect to fill your own 'order form' only to be reviewed by the waiting staff). My favorites include the oriental salad, the steamed dumplings (esp. the pork Xiao Long Bao), and dan-dan noodle
3
Came here with friends who are regulars here and so the choices from the menu was theirs, but the choices were good as it was all the things I enjoyed. However, for all the hype that came with this place, half of the dishes were hits and the other half we misses. The truffle xiao long bao was something interesting and definitely fragrant. Much better than the plan xiao long bao, which, in all honesty, I can get better at the hawker stall in Bukit Merah. The favourite among most of the group seems to be the wonton with black vinegar and chilli oil. While there was a noodle dish that just bored everyone, and that included a child. Service was not great, but not bad either
4
The food was good, the table was fine, but it's just taking a bit too long for the menu came out (since it's around 2pm and there's only a few guests at that time also).
5
PROS
Authentic Chinese Food
Delicious
Glass panels on the chefs side, you can see how the dumplings are made
Ambience
Interiors
CONS
Pricey but no regrets!
5
Jasmine tea was served as we took seat. Dumplings were amazing so we're fried rice. Nice food. Nice people. Even veggies get some choice here
4
Me and my daughter visited Din Tai Fung as recommended on Tripadvisor. The shrimp and pork dumplings were great and so was the mushroom Noodles. Fried rice was a little plain but overall very nice. Reasonable price.
3
Stoped by for a quick bite. The place was 2/3 full. The hostess didn't impress me at all. Gave me the menu and a pen and told me to write what I wanted while wait for the table. Not a good signal in my opinion since this restaurant, although isn't any top notch 5 star restaurant, isn't a fast food as per say. I though the whole dim sun experience was about to be able to try different portions, repeat what you like, etc. So, appetizer came first with Juice (awesome juice btw. Lemongrass) after 10 minutes the second dim sum. After couple minutes my bun. The guy who brought the bun set the little tray on top of my dim sum. As soon as I got the bun another waiter came and took it everything, but I had still 4 dumplings. Bottom line: food is ok, price is reasonable and the service is bad. Wouldn't be fair to say it is terrible, but isn't good at all. I guess you can have a much better experience for a fraction of the price at the local food market
5
I'm a huge fan of xiao long bao but haven't been impressed with the Din Tai Fung branches in the U.S., Taipei nor Hong Kong. To my pleasant surprise, this branch not only had delicious dumplings but also offers a variety of mouth watering side dishes and main dishes. Although the dishes were small similar to other branches, it allowed my family to try many items on the menu. We came on a weekday during lunch hour and had a short wait. However, I must say the wait was worthwhile. If you think Din Tai Fung is overrated, you might want to give this branch a try... Or if you like this place already, it won't disappoint
5
Located on the 2nd floor of Sun Tec city, we make it a point to eat here every time we visit.It has a very nice local vibe to it and is very easy to get to.The Chinese food is superb, delicious and fairly-priced. It is delivered/served Chinese restaurant style of course and payment is upon exit.Be forewarned though, this place is popular with both locals and visitors alike and there can be a line. Waits of up 45 mins when very busy are not unusual and since they cook their food for you fresh another 10-25 min await can add to this at peak hours.My advice? go weekdays and just before dinnertime (which starts 7pm in Asia) just as we do. There are no lines then.. Happy eating
2
Was here at 8pm on 15 Jan 2017. Told that the queue is 25-30mins long. We decided to queue. At 832pm, orders were taken and shown to our seats. At 847pm, no food has arrived. Checked with the waitress and was told vege need another 5mins, noodles and xiao long bao will take longer(no known time). If I am supposed to wait another 25 mins for my food shouldn't I be informed when they take my order?!
5
This restaurant greatly exceeded our expectations.My wife and I never expected to have such memorable dim sum on the 2nd floor of the Suntec City mall. We were walking through the mall one afternoon shortly before Christmas, killing time before taking the 6:00 PM bus to see the spectacular Christmas lights and displays along Orchard Road, when we saw a large crowd gathered outside the entrance to this restaurant. Although there were numerous other restaurants in close proximity, this is the only one with a significant crowd outside. This is always a sign of good food, and particularly so in Singapore.We read the history of the original restaurant in Taiwan on the sign posted outside, and watched the chefs artfully making their dumplings in the exposed kitchen, and decided to have an early dinner.The lightness and quality of the dumplings were superb. The shrimp and pork and the pork and gourd dumplings, in particular, were spectacular, as were the sweet yam dumplings and the coconut peanut dessert dumplings. The stuffed red dates were luscious.We enjoyed the food so much that we returned the following evening for dinner again, which is almost a sin in Singapore, with so many marvelous restaurants available.I still have a hard time believing that this is a chain restaurant. The food quality, presentation, attention to detail, and service all seem to be far too high in quality for chain.If you are visiting Singapore and are near the Suntec City Center, treat yourself to a meal or snack here. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s all about the dumplings
5
We tried this place three years ago on Sentosa island and my sons wanted to go back. We found it at Suntec.Tea flows continually.The cooks make the dumplings in the glassed kitchen.The soup dumplings are a must- we had three helpings of ten each.As well as pork buns and chilli crab ones.To die for. My husband and younger son wanted to try the ones with truffle oil- not cheap at $5 each but they said it was delicious.Recommend
4
Great food -- speedy service and the legendary taste of Din Tai Fung. The vegetable selection was great as were the dumplings.
4
As always the food here was amazing. Dumplings are delicious, as are the pork rolls, the deep fried pork and rice, the bok choi etc. I can not fault the food.The service however wasn't wonderful. Very rushed and sometimes giving the wrong dishes to the wrong table. I'd still go back as I love the food but at least I'd know what to expect
4
Following my family's bad experience at the Jurong Point branch, we went about trying the rest of the chains. We concluded that the Jurong Point branch is a shame to the brand and that their management should really do something about it. At this Suntec branch, we had to take a queue number, but we were seated within 10 minutes as promised by the courteous lady at the counter. At the Jurong Point branch, you will be greeted with empty seats and a grumpy Chinese lady who refuses to understand you and insists that the seats are available only after 20 minutes. The food is also better, probably due to better staff culture and morale. Once again, the food never fails with the standard meat dumplings, noodles and fried rice. Having said that, I still rank the branch in Raffles City as the best branch for the taste. Will definitely return to these positive examples and never to the Jurong Point branch
3
One of the many outlets of the popular restaurant from Taiwan, this is in a convenient location for gatherings and always a safe choice to bring foreign guests who want to have Chinese food. Almost always packed, the restaurant can get a little too noisy and does not have private dining rooms for lunch meetings
2
I have been to various Din Tai Fung restaurants, and although the food is great as it is in all of them, the service was atrocious. I was by myself, and only ordered 3 small dishes, and it took 1 hour from ordering to get the food. I got very poor response when I complained - sorry sorry sorry with absolutely no feeling behind it. 2 very large groups came in after me and were well finished and gone before me.I guess I should have jumped up and down a bit sooner, but I don't like making a scene. If somebody had come near me I would have said something, but I was completely ignored
4
Having visited various Din Tai Fung across the globe I have to say this is one of the better ones. As usual, get there early and order a lot. Their dan dan noodle is less spicy than other branches that I have been to, but their vegetarian dumpling option is a must. Touristy spot, but most are anyway
5
could only go here on Saturday night and there was a 30 minute wait in the queue followed by about 20 minutes waiting for food to be delivered. Filled in the order sheet whilst waiting outside and the lady at the front desk was very helpful when I had queries. Food was fresh and lovely, service professional and we left feeling full and happy. Once we were seated even though there was a queue to get in there was no rush to make us eat and get out as in some other busy restaurants. The cost was also not excessive
4
had late lunch there on a Monday, so it was not crowded like usual. easily got a table. yummy xiaolongbao, tasty fried rice, beef noodle, cold drunken chicken, fried wanton with pork and shrimp.fast and prompt service by the wait staff, though xiaolongbao take a while cos they are freshly made and steamed after receiving order
4
In a recessionary retail environment in Singapore, Din Tai Fung continues to outperform, attracting locals and expats alike. We go there at least once a month on weekends. The reasons are, I believe, consistent quality of food, universally acceptable dishes for all ages, good service and nice ambience for family dining. They offer better value and taste than their rivals such as Crystal Jade. If you want the more comprehensive menu though, you have to go to Malaysia.
4
Regardless of coming to Singapore for years I had never dined at Din Tai Fung although I have passed many of the restaurants noting the queues, maybe I'm not the sharpest tool in the box as the penny never dropped until I finally opted to dine at the restaurant in Suntec city and realized why there always seemed to be queues. What a dining experience, we opted for a range of dumpling dishes that were truly mouthwatering, very moreish and my favourite was the crabmeat dumpling. Considering this can be considered a chain restaurant it was extremely good quality and I would have given it a 5 but to me the layout is purely functional so not a place for an intimate meal, that said I thoroughly suggest you try one of these restaurants
5
Fab quick meal while in Singapore. We had great greens and loads of dumplings. Really great - highly recommended for a quick tasty food value meal!
5
Fantastic restaurant where you can look straight into the marvellously clean kitchen. Speeady service and the most fantastic dumplings you'll ever eat. Try the ones with chili and garlic oil and you have a culinary memory for life!!! Yum!
5
Very efficient service. Love the food here, dumplings are always well made. I also like their cold salads - very tasty.
5
If in doubt just order the pork buns as they are amazing.
Choose from a list & everything we tried was outstanding in quality & flavour
4
Very delicious, you can choose of a wide range of dumplings, a bit pricey but definitely worth it. On peak hours you might wait a little bit to be seated. Once you have a seat there is already a cup of hot jasmine tea which will be automatically refilled. For the tea there will be an extra charge of 1 SGD
5
Other than the amazing Crabmeat dumplings, their shredded pork fried rice is also to die for. Another favourite of mine is the Hot and Sour soup, although i think it is more sour than hot. I love this restaurant for its consistent quality of food and efficiency. Come early or face the risk of having to queue for an hour or more
4
Visited this restaurant last night on my way to watch the European Football. Arrived quite late so there was no queue. There is usually a long queue and a long wait here, but coming late avoided that.Sat at a table immediately and given the menu and order form. Waiters and waitresses are mainly from China and speak limited English - so the pad order request idea is quite good. Love the nice moist dumplings, and had a selection of other delicacies, which we all shared. It was a nice dinner which I enjoyed. No frills service but good food.If you come early, be prepared to wait
4
Place was full. Arrived early yet we have to wait for 20 minutes. It was a weekend . Diversity in guests noted . Many tourists and locals as well. Dimsum particularly xiao long bao and the shrimp dumpling was excellent . The vegetables dumpling , rice , shrimp pancake were also nice but really just second fiddle to the specialties . Service was prompt . Little cramped environment , but will suffice . Don't miss visiting this restaurant .
3
it is a popular food place inside Suntec city - you often have to wait a bit to get seated. You were given an order paper while you were waiting to make the selection. The food was good, not cheap. Two of our five people had tummy issues after eating their food - probably from the under-cooked food due to a large demand
4
We stop for a lunch, teh waiters are very nice, the service slightly slow, but the dim sum were very good and it is very good value for money.Conveniently located at Suntec, good for a quick meal while shopping or if you are at one of the several exhibition at Suntec
5
There are a number of Din Tai Fung restaurants around the city. We chose the one at Suntec as it was a short taxi ride from our hotel. The pork Dim sum is best as is the vegetable and pork
5
Expected quality and 100% delivered. Delicious fare at very reasonable prices. The wantons in black vinegar & chilli oil was excellent but of course there's no going past the XLB. Definitely worth visiting any DTF during a trip to Singapore!
4
Great service! The place was packed with families and screaming children (Sunday's lunch time) but that did not bother me at all. The food was just fantastic! I enjoyed every piece of food and I could not have enough.
3
Having been to DTF in Hong Kong and Dubai, I was looking forward to this visit. I was a solo diner and arrived just before lunch time to avoid the rush. Sadly I found the service very minimal and rushed and not friendly at all. The food was fantastic, although they didn't serve xiao long bao or pot stickers
5
This was my first experience of Din Tai Fung and it was very memorable. The service and surroundings are very nice but the food was outstanding. Both days we ate lunch here we had to take a number and wait but the queue moves pretty fast and in 20 minutes we were seated. You can pre-order so once you sit down those decisions are made and you are ready to eat. The barls (steamed buns) with chili crab and pork were great but my personal favourite was the plain pork variety. The bun casing is remarkably thin and delicate. The dumplings are filled with soup which gushes out when you bite them so be careful not to waste any or burn your lip! The shrimp and pork were my favourite. We also had stir fried veges with garlic which provided nice contrast to an outstanding meal
5
The food at DTF is always consistent from LA to Singapore i love the foodThe soup dumplings arent as good as joe shanghai in new york, but at the price you really cant complain, we were woofing down so many dumplings that by the end of the night we were completely stuffed and suffering a massive food commaThe service is so attentive, they provide bag holders for ladies and you never ever have to raise your hand for waters.'if you have never tried a DTF you need to, its an incredible experience and one that wont break the bank
5
I live the food at Din Tai Fung especially the dumplings whish are always good. There many branches are always bustling and there is a good reason for this because everything is freshly made in house and the food is sooo good. I always find one of these restaurants when I am in Singapore
4
The food in this restaurant was great but the only thing that I didn't like was that most of the foods such as the fried rice with eggs,stirred fried spinach with garlic and the crab meat and pork dumplings is quite stuffing so I recommend to never order too much or your tummy won't be great and oh the pricing is the worst because the price of most of the food is quite high maybe the waiters can reduce the amount of the price for each foodBut overall:The food is awesom
5
This restaurant is part of a big chain but wherever you go it is the same quality in food and service. There is an army of staff from the guys preparing the dim sums to the ladies serving you. It is a must go place for people who like dim sums and Chinese like veggies and rice dishes
5
For the best dim sums in the world, head to any of the Din Tai Fung outlets in Singapore for all-day dining.The dim sums come in many variants - all melting in the mouth. They are light and delicious to the core.Highly recommended for dim sums and all chinese food. Food here is not spicy, and indeed excellent flavoured
5
Best dumplings in town that consistently deliver. Come early to avoid the lines. High quality food in a semi casual setting.
3
DTF is always pretty yummy. Suntec brunch is always busy and a good place for lunch. Love the appetizers like the Braised Beancurd, Cucumber. And also the standard Dumplings and the one in Spicy Sauce and Vinegar!
5
Hands down the freshest and tastiest dim sum anywhere. Ate at 2 other branches that were of the same high standard. Probably my favourite restaurant in Singapore.
4
Great taste as experienced in other countries, with its high standard.Steamed veggie dumpling is nice with soy sauce, but even better with sauce from shrimp dumpling (w/o soup) in blended green onion sauce.Chicken soup is always the first choice for this restaurant.Baby cucumber with chillies is good to enjoy with fried rice
5
Great dumplings, freshly cooked (as you can see them being made in the front of the store). Service was good, and not too fussy. Busy restaurant ... we had to order before entering and then wait for our table to be available. Even though it was lunch time the wait was only a few minutes. Thoroughly recommend
5
It was indeed an amazing experience to dine here. I was recommended by my wife and sure though she was right. The service, ambience and obviously the food was amazing. The Oriental Wantons in Black vinegar and Chilli Oil, Fried Rice with Pork Chops and Pork Steamed buns. Definitely going to visit to try more items on their menu
5
vegetarians only have very few options to choose from menu.. we had veg dumplings and veg buns .. love them with the free flow of green fragrant tea.. But suntech branch is very busy and you have to wait in long queues especially on friday's.. you can visit brass basa branch.. less crowdy.
5
I just had dumplings and wontons, I was just craving for that. I have to say, they are the best ones I've ever had. I read the bad reviews to try to understand, but I have to say, I did not experience any similar situation. I guess if you eat in SG everyday, the five rating would be harder to give (so many great places), but I really was happy with everything. Even their tea was excellent. I was given a 20 minute wait, the food started coming in less than 10. The service was efficient and friendly (not always guaranteed at a Chinese place, as we all know
2
After craving for Xiao Long Bao (XLB) for the longest time, I was disappointed with the 'taste' factor at this particular Din Tai Fung (DTF) outlet. Sadly, everything tasted mildly under-rated and not of the usual Din Tai Fung standard that I've come to love.Our order:- Xiao Long Bao: Ah! another one of my must-order dishes! The skin is thin as ever but the soup tasted bland! Goodness! The meat portion in each XLB shrank too! I must say that Paradise Inn's XLB taste better. Boohoo to DTF!- Fried rice with shrimp: I used to rave about DTF's fried rice but this dish at this outlet failed to excite me. Every grain of rice is coated evenly with flavouring and shiny with oil but tasted quite bland to me. - Oriental salad with vinegar dressing: if you're hungry and couldn't stand the long wait for the food, order this! The oriental salad comprised vermicelli, shredded seaweed, carrots, bean sprouts tossed in their special vinegar dressing. The vinegar dressing encapsulates the term "appetizer" which makes you even hungrier while simultaneously filling in the major hunger pangs quite nicely for 15 minutes until your main dish arrives. - Hot and Sour soup: another one of my favourites that let me down. The previous version of the soup packed a punch with a balanced taste of sour and spiciness. This time around, it tasted (for lack of a better word) normal aka like those low-grade starchy shark's fin soup. Kinda regretted ordering the large portion.Would still patronize DTF but ultimately, I prefer Paradise Inn at this point in time. Wondering why there are still so long queues outside DTF at every outlet. Food for thought
3
Im a great fan of Din Tai Fung - especially their signature Xiao Long Bao is a must have treat when Im often back in Singapore.However the difference between the different branches are unfortunately quite big, and it seems that only the Paragon branch, seems to get the taste exactly right. Din Tai Fung is a must try if you're into dumplings, but go for the one at Paragon
5
The dumplings at this place are simply out of this world. I enjoyed them so much I asked for another helping. No wonder there's a long line to get in!
5
Excellent food
Fantastic Xiao Long Bao dim sums
Great stir fried vegetables as well
Definitely worth the waiting, although if you visit them outside of peak hours it should be ok.
4
This restaurant is he place for good dim sums, buns and efficient service. It is running like the army. They even have chocolate buns for dessert. This restaurant is in a shopping mall so there is no view.
4
The food was good, a varying selection of dumplings and other dishes and not expensive. A great place to have lunch even at 2.30pm!
4
New branch restaurant in Suntec. Is an interesting place to people's watch while eating fantastic, reasonably priced food. Spicy noodles were especially good as were any of the gourmet dumplings and buns we sampled that they prepare in an open kitchen. Service was excellent but a little disjointed. Dishes are obviously prepared at different stations so food arrives as it is cooked, not in a coordinated fashion. Since it is dim sum style, this works. Don't miss this when in Singapore. Delicious food and many branches throughout city
5
A very interesting set up. You wait at reception and are given a menu board and a waiting time ticket. It seems that it is always nearly full. we went on a weeknight.The quality of the food was the best Chinese food my wife and I have ever had. The service was very good and they were so thoughtful as to bring you a security bin by your table to put your hand bag or shopping in. The flow of Jasmine tea was continuous. We had about 3 different dishes between the two of us and they were quite ample and filling. We went a second time ( the next night) as we were so impressed. Price wise was not bad except for the additional 10% service charge and the 7 % GST charges not clearly indicated on the price lists.We spent about $35 the first time and $45 the second
4
I have had Din Tai Fung in many places, Taiwan, Shanghai, Beijing, Bellevue, and Singapore. The menu in Singapore is a bit different as it serves some local specials. For example, the chili crab and pork buns has incorporated the idea and flavor of the famous Singapore Chili Crab, and it's really delicious. For dessert, they modified the normal red bean bun and added chocolate, so it's like a mini chocolate lava bun, very unique and tasted very good when pairing with the jasmine tea. Thumbs up for these innovative dishes
5
If you check out my reviews I am very bias towards this chain, there is a reason, its GREAT!! No exception here, the food was awesome. The service didnt have the usual panache of the other Din Tai Fung locations around the world we have been but the food trumps that. Like many other locations expect a wait...its all worth it when you leave
5
Great food, as usual. We tried spicy hot and sour soup, green chillied marinated with stuffed minced meat (great), crab/pork/chicken dumplings, fried rice with shrimps and eggs (super) and oriental salad with special vinegar dressing. Fabulous food. Worth the wait of over 20 minutes outside the restaurant
5
This place is always busy, and for good reason. It is highly recommended by all who have ever visited.Check the menu outside, make your selections, then order while waiting to be seated.One of the best items on their menu is the pork and black truffle dumpling.
3
Very average experience compared to every other DTF I have visited. The menu seems smaller, the food less tasty and the service slower. It wasn't even full at lunch time and there was no queue. Odd
5
One of my favorite chinese restaurant. My family loves the steamed dumplings. Service is fast and efficient. Worth the short wait.
3
The msg is a lot, and the quality of food is ok. the service is also not that great especially during peak hour. would i go again? Honestly, no.
4

A few days ago i went with some collegues to this restaurant. About 45 min waiting time on a saturday evening. But it was worth it. Really friendly staff and really good food.
The various dim sum etc are really delicious.

Either the brand is terrible or we just landed on the wrong one. Located in a grotty mall, it was something akin to school dinners or a supermarket buffet. Given the incredibly positive reviews for other branches across the region, we were unfortunately dissuaded from trying others. we ate, we were OK but it was quite a disappointing experienc

It's a nice busy restaurant. Love the food. Have to wait for 20 mins to get a table. However worth the wait. One thing I wanted to was dumplings so sad every dumpling had pork in it. The one which i could try was veggies only. But I wanted seafood. Anyway the service is speed. Customer service can be improved by a simple smile. Servers look sad. Anyway I recommend this to any visitor.

This great chain of dumpling restaurants are sited throughout Asia and now Australia and the U.S. They are always busy and popular so be prepared for a but of a wait. When you register at the entry desk you are given some idea of the wait, usually 10-20 minutes, and a menu to fill in before being shown to your table. It is a tick box type menu and facilitates the food order and service. A little compartment is placed next to the table for storage of handbags etc. you can observe the dumplings being made by the chefs via a glass viewing window and it is fu to watch these folk beavering away dressed in almost surgical sterile gear as they make the meals.prices are not cheap but the quality of the dumplings are second to none. You order boxes with 6 or 8 pieces to share. The Hot and Sour Soup is great. Deserts, like in most Asian restaurants, are not their forte but you will not be disappointed with the steamed dumplings. These restaurants are not for a quiet night out or a romantic dinner but do serve superb Asian food in nice realistic surroundings

Since this was across our hotel, we decided to eat here instead of crossing the bay to get to the Marina Bay Sands branch. The menu seemed more limited. The fish curry soup that we enjoyed on the other side was not listed. I ordered hot and sour soup which was neither spicy nor sour. The meal was a disappointment. I still prefer Crystal Jade in Hong Kong for this price category

I love Din Tai Fung so was excited to find this one so close to my hotel. I was disappointed though- compared to my usual at Raffles Mall the service was VERY slow. The wontons when they arrived were lukewarm and the guests at the table next to me had around 7 dishes delivered between my two dishes I ordered. Had an empty tea mug for most of my stay. Will stick to the usual from now on. Disappointed.

This is a Michelin star Dim Sum restaurant. It is extremely well priced and the food is fresh and delicious. You can watch the chefs making the dumplings and noodles in the kitchen. Highly recommend

The staff welcomes us at the entrance of the restaurant and politely ask how many person to dine in.Then they guide us along the seats and inform us that we may need to wait for 15-30 mins for our order.We managed to place our order and the food arrived faster than expected.The staffs are very friendly, attentive and helpful. They try to top up the hot tea as and when they passes by.They will politely said excuse and top up our drink. They will also ask if we need the cover for our food as we are not eating the food we ordered. They managed to clear our tables once we finished our food. Maybe it's a weekday evening but overall well done. Will definitely eat here again!

I really liked Din Tai Fung. My mom had a nicely sized seaweed salad worth it's price, $4. There was a nice, hot complimentary tea that they gave, which was refilled for free. We had some prawn fried rice, which was quite buttery and melted in my mouth. I had a chicken soup, which had a mouthwatering, delightful broth and generous portions of juicy, tender chicken that fell off the bones. The pork dumplings were tasty and the flavor exploded in my mouth. The Shrimp & Gourd dumplings were low on salt and had mostly no taste. In the waiting line, they gave you a menu, clipboard with an order sheet and a number. You had to choose what you wanted to eat and select it on the order sheet. After two minutes we got in the restaurant. After that, the food came in 5-10 minutes. I also had a delicious, yummy, super good Red Bean Rice Dumpling, which was the size of 3 normal dumplings stuck together. This restaurant had really nice food, especially the Red Bean Rice dumpling!!

Our family of five thoroughly enjoyed our meal here. We came at the peak time for dinner so quite a long wait (about an hour) to get a table, but once seated we didn't have to wait too much longer. We sampled the dumplings , buns and wontons and all were delicious. It wasn't a cheap meal, but very enjoyable. The staff were a little preoccupied with processing the sheers numbers, but this isn't the type of place to worry about service, just enjoy their specialty food which is the steamed dumplings

Food was exceptionally good and served fresh, everything was up to what I had expected it to be. We were seated quickly since we had early lunch. The server was nice enough to repeat our orders although she spoke Chinese quickly. Overall, it was pleasant experience and reasonably priced filling meal

Our 1st time in this great city,and in a mall when lunch beckoned,but didn't expect much from within a food court,given the poor standards we expect in UK and USA,but were we mistaken big style. This may be a chain,but the Hong Kong branch,probably the big brother, has a Michelin star. A huge Chinese -Malaysian menu,with several soups and lots of yummy dumplings had as deliberating for ages,but no worries,as Chinese tea was already on our table and topped up regularly as part of the meal deal.Fabulous food - not tasted better in a top notch Chinese in UK and all for very low price. We noted they have many in Singapore,and possibly New York;perhaps they'll try London as 1st step in UK - would be worth the trip there just to experience this food again

Friends had said to go to Din Tai Fung and know I know why. I love the soup dumplings, my wife not so much. Best tip is to go before or after the main sitting times to avoid long waits. This restaurant look is ok for a shopping center and service is also OK but the main thing is the food. This was hot fresh and yummy.
