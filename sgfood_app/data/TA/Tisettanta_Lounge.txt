Very pleasant lounge bar environment with 1 for 1 drinks on most drinks from 3-9pm each day.
Staff are excellent and service to match.

Came to try their high tea and must say really enjoyed the selection. For just $25++ per set the spread was great. From sandwiches, macarons to local delight such as kueh pie tall were yummy plus the cafe is not packed even on a Saturday afternoon.Cons is the service - only one staff around and we had to keep going to get him. However quite a friendly staff though. Though there were only a few patrons but i think they were pretty inconsiderate or the staff did not usher them to the appropriate tables. There was a lady all by herself occuptying a big table meant for at least 6-7 pax. Another big table was taken by some internal staffs and one was sleeping on the sofa. In the end we requested to share the big table because the table was too small for our order. On the whole, nice ambience to have a quiet afternoon

We went here each night for a couple of drinks before calling it a night and found it very quiet which was no problem for us at all.The service was excellent,felt the prices were a little high but that happens in hotels in Singapore most the time.However,the two for one offer made up for that

Food overcooked and overpriced.Service left much to be desired:Senior catering sales manager - Sophia Beh was very rude and very difficult to work with. Was not responsive and treated us like the last priority on her list.Other 5 star hotels I have organized events with have been infinitely more accomodating and very easy to work with.Despite the beautiful location, will not recommend to organize any event at Hotel Fort Canning
