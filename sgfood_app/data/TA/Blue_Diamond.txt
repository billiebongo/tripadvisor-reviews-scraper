Just an average restaurant with quite number of varieties, taste wise is ok, lack of staffs and when it gets too crowded over the weekends, ohhhh gosh, you should know what to do. This restaurant has since closed down due to what reason un known.

The food is good and has been the same over the last decade or so. A wide choice of Indian food. Spicy and tasty.

Very nice food, atmosphere and service (they even have iPads!) in this typical Little India restaurant. For a quick breakfast or a whole meal, I definitely recommend it.

Had lunch here today, simple Singaporean Indian Restaurant but terrific food and for those that do not like to hot it is medium. Great value for money

Went to the famous Blue Diamond Restaurant for lunch. Typical Indian Muslim Restaurant with variety of curries and masala display on their ordering shelf. There seems to be a tandoori and naan counter tucked at side of the entrance, but our main aim is to savour the most talked Briyani that they served. I ordered a mutton biryani which comes in a pot and of course the banana leaves as serving trays. the results... Most satisfying Briyani I ever had. Their fish cutlets are also nice. The taste of the curries somehow different than the usual Indian Restaurants that I have patronised. Its the marinating and amount of spices I guess that makes their food seems better. Will definitely be back

Visited Blue Diamond on our trip to Little India. Ordered Chicken biryani and yes they were delicious.The whole dish were enclosed in a big bowl covered tightly on top with foil. Inside in the middle was the chicken itself plus a boil egg, all encompassed by rice, all very nice and fragrant.There was some brown sauce /dip to have with the rice, very nice, also some chopped cucumber in milky sauce. The dish came with some naan (?) as well. We gave them a thump up.It was very convenient, only a few steps to mrt from the restaurant or Tekka Centre. We went there by bus, and back by mrt. We were served well by the public transport of Singapore

People say this place lacks atmosphere but we didnt find it that bad. The ipad menus were good as they had pics but seems they remove them at night. And yes it is strange you cannot order with them. Tho you can call the waiter or order up a bill... tho its the same thing a guy just comes to ask whats up. Food is good. We loved the mutton biryani and went back the next day for a second helping. Chicken tikka masala was not sweet and lovely and spicy. Murtaba was ok. Parata was a bit hard for our liking.All in all a good cheap meal

We took a subway ride into Little India and looked around for a restaurant - came across Blue Diamond - the naan and roti bread is cooked fresh in the entrance of the shop, it was filled with locals and looked clean and so we gave it a go. As we were clearly tourists, we had a waiter who went to a lot of trouble to help us with the menu and let my children know what would be very spicy and what wouldn't. We had about six dishes off the menu including the naan and roti breads and all came out quickly and freshly cooked. SO GOOD. The tandoori chicken was amazing. We had a big feast and all for about $50SGD. Well worth it. Would recommend for both food, service and atmosphere

I had a great chicken biryani with a friend and even ordered a take away.The only setback Is the place is little cramed up and servuce could be better .They have a high tech menu .Next visit might try other dishes on display on banmarie.

The mutton nasi Briyani is so good in blue diamond, if you are into Indian food, I assured you that after eating the Briyani, you will want to come back and eat it again and again.
A real good find for me.

Excellent thosai & dum braini

I had expected this place to be bigger - but it is actually quite small inside seating only about 50. All the menus are on iPads on the tables but the iPads are NOT for ordering. It is sort of air conditioned but because there is no front door, it is not exactly cool inside but the air conditioning does prevent the inside from getting too stuffy and the open front means the cooking smells don't get trapped. Most of the food here is quite decent. We ordered lots of food and the highlights were the mutton and chicken biryanis which were quite flavourful. Not the best though - I would have liked a bit more fried-onion flavour and a bit more colour. At US$6 each for quite a large portion, it was quite good value too. The masala dosa and local roti prata were excellent. The murgh malai kebab was quite good. The mutton and chicken masalas were only average as they lacked punch.We spend about US$8 (S$10) each and walked out with a doggy bag

Any one looking for good value Indian food be it Vegetarian or Non-Vegetarian, do visit the Blue Diamond restaurant. The restaurant is situated in Buffalo Road near TIKKA MARKET in LITTLE INDIA. You can reach it via MRT, get off at LITTLE INDIA station and go towards the CITY SQUARE direction. The restaurant is very small, and many a time the diners have to share tables. The ambience is NIL; but the food is very good, so are the prices. A good Nasi Briyani with chicken and side dishes of yoga, curry source.......cost only S$7! The Tandoori is good too; do are the other dishes. Other Indian restaurants around the area will normally charge around S$11; yet the quality of food is poor in comparison to Blue Diamond. BON APPETTI

As good Indian food as there is in Singapore or anywhere else for that matter. Basic and cheap. It's all about the food here. The briyani is great, but the so is everything here. I've been here many times to eat in or take away and found the food consistently good

I walked in with no idea of what to get or what was offered. I had been walking around Little India and got hungry. With iPads on every table, I was able to get complete descriptions and photos of food offered. I had grown frustrated with Singapore food prices and was happy to see that most food here was under S$10! I ordered my food "take-away" and a generous portion was placed on a banana leaf and rolled up and boxed with the most delicious mild curry sauce placed in a sealed bag (with more than I needed in one sitting so I continued to use it with breakfast and other meals brought home or made at home!) So so good! I've been back with friends more than once

Simply love the dum briyani (chicken) with hardboiled egg & papadum. Spices just nice to complement the dish. One of the old man who's working in the restaurant approached us to see if we need anything else & ask for feedback on the food. It is not a closed door airconditioned restaurant but more like coffee shop with fans. Overall we feel comfortable & welcome

Whenever I visit Singapore and into tthe Little India area, I have been stopping at the Blue Diamond for the Lamb Bryani, always consistent in quality and quantity. The fish cutlets were good as well a little spicy some times, well South Indian food cannot be without it's spices and chilles. and I dose it down with freashly squeezed lime juice.Crowded during the lunch times and the lovely smell of spices stays in the air all the time.. that's good for me
