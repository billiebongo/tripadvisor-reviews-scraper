Came twice to this restaurant. Very convenient location from Beauty World MRT and has variety of good food to choose from.
4
Drinks came promptly. White seafood noodle with salted egg yolk came piping hot and tasted satisfying. 2 large prAwns, many clams. Will be back to try the bak kut the which many were having
5
Yummy food! Good soup base not too peppery. Generous free flow of soup. We had salted vegetable, beancurd skin n braised pork. All good!
5
Delicious BKT and side dishes with friendly & efficient service! Recommend the bean curd skin and braised meat.
Soup is tasty and peppery not the herbal kind. Pricing quite reasonable but parking can be challenging. Will be back again
4
The food here was nice. Sibei good. Nearby my house too. The food here was quite cheap too. Totally worth it.
5
Tried the bah kut teh.. Nice.. Will be back soon..
The white beehoon.. hmmm.. U see the photo lo
Service wise can be slightly better..
5
Good food.. good coloring.. service good everything good good good so good very good.... totally enjoy my visit
5
The environment is nice and food is good. Will recommend their Bak kit Tek as its peppery and meat is soft
4
Food was great, I would rate the bak kut teh as the best here. I came with friends and tried out few different dishes. But the Bak Kut Teh was the most outstanding one out of all. The pork knuckle is another dish that I recommend. The meat is tender and soft and well seasoned. Overall great experience at Koon Bak Kut Te
3
Food was pretty good. We had the standard bak kut teh which was fragrant and tender. The pork trotters we had was quite delightful. However, comparing the amount and the price, i feel that part could be improved as it wasnt really enough for us to be ful
4
Great atmosphere with nice food
The price is too expensiveb ut nevermind because it is okay as i am damn hungry and i apologise for dabaoing prata to ur shop lol
3
Its nice. Smart marketing reviews. Not sure of the outcome yet though i think its nice. The smell of the bak ku teh is nice
5
The overall place is not bad . Music is nice and place is also clean. Of course the service is good too !üòÉ

5
One of the few places with air con at this place. You also get free drink. With a review. The white beehoon is also quite nice.
3

Second visit and they serve Good food. The pork is very tender. Comfortable place for lunch. I like it
4
White bee hoon in tasty broth. Bak ku teh is nice especially on a cold night. Service is good too. They also serve normal double boiled soup for those, especially kids who can't take spice or pepper.
3
Clean, nice, great place to eat and chill with friends. Have not been here a lot, but first experience is prerty decent.
4
Ordered white seafood bee hoon n Kong Bak (Braised Chinese Pork). Bee Hoon was ok but as the braised pork was cut into small pieces for cooking, it dries up the meat but the fat is melting in your mouth though. So I would give it a mixed 4 star. Surprisingly ice lemon tea was prepared and made in the shop!
5
Good food with affordable prices and good atmosphere. Nice place for relaxing. Would come back here again!
