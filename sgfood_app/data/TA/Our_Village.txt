A hidden gem I would say. Go for the rooftop terrace for the stunning view. Food is excellent and plenty of friendly waiters.

Been here a dozen times. Tonight the manager comes over mid meal and demands a minimum spend per customer. It was late and place was half empty. Two people came late and had drinks. We assumed the demand to spend an extra 17 dollars to hit the minimum spend was a joke. Sadly not. Most bizarre restaurant experience of my 20 years in Singapore. Ripping tourists off is clearly the only goal. Avoid.......
1
Group of 9 of us came for dinner and drinks. The service was horrendous!!! We were made to pay the minimum for people who came late and only ordered water!! They alert us during dinner that we need to order $60 to meet the minimum. We ask to see the running total and are told that they are unable to print off the bill without closing it! In my 9 years of being in Singapore I have never been to a restaurant with such bad service!! Your manager is inept!! We would have happily have met the minimum requirement had we not been approached in such a rude manner!! Sort out your food and service!! BAD, BAD, BAD!!!!!! Being forced to give a rating so giving it a one else would have given a zero!!

Used to go there to have the yummy Sri Lankan food, which is almost impossible to find elsewhere in Singapore. However, they updated the menu and almost everything we used to order has disappeared. Some of the food is very yummy, but the price is bit on the high side, service is slow too

Excellent Indian / Sri Lankan restaurant with indoor seating on 2 floors, and great roof top terrace overlooking Boat Quay (reserve an outside table when you book). Great friendly waiters. Against most of the dishes on the long menu is recorded the number of times the dish has been ordered since the restaurant opened. Although the data is somewhat out of date, I have no doubt it is still being faithfully recorded and the numbers will be updated on the next reprint! Great curries, great breads, and lots of cold beer. Slightly oddly, it is technically 2 restaurants and we got 2 bills, as some dishes are from one restaurant and others provided by the other! Would definitely return

This place has gone to the dumps! Food used to be ok but service was never any good. Recently though had a horrible experience at this place- went there with my family (2 kids) and after placing order the waiter 'advised' me that i had to place more order as the 'expected spend' per person was 43sgd to be precise ie i had to order more food and drinks to make up for the kids!! I asked so what if my order falls short then the so called manager informed me that he would not serve us! Whoa- what an attitude man- straight away got up as didnt like the so called expected spend attitude and the roughshod behavior of the service staff... spending money is not an issue but to be advised that i needed to order more was very unwelcome... avoid this place if u can. Infact we dined at the kinara brand indianmexican patros place right below this godforsaken indian village. Patros had a better seating right next to river, amazing food and service and more variety plus better prices! Avoid punjab da dhaba/ our village unless u want to be told that u need to spend 43sgd per person to be precise and get the very worst of service and overspend for food

We ate as a group of 6 and the views and ambiance were fine. There was only 3 groups in the restaurant and service was good.I thought the food variable ,however,my wife thought the chicken tikka the best she has tasted.Overall not a cheap venue and I thought the drinks expensive but we did enjoy our eating experience
3
My daughter took me out for a treat. There is no doubt that the roof part of the restaurant was a splendid location The waiting staff were slow and possibly a bit dozy. Whilst appreciating the good views the service was ultra slow and it was almost an hour before got our main course. The portions were ok just, depending on appetite. Generally I was not impressed and cannot rave about it. When the food came it was luke warm. Some may wish to give emphasis to the service being non hurried giving a greater opportunity for chit chat with your partner. The food was tasty but not like the curry served in UK restaurant

Our Village Indian, Boat QuayLocated half-way along Boat Quay, the Our Village Indian restaurant could be easily missed because it's not at street level. The restaurant is located on the 5th and 6th floor (accessed via an elevator) and there's also a third level offering an outdoor / roof-top patio dining area.The service was efficient but somewhat slow, but even at 10pm the place was busy. The food was tasty and flavourful, we had the chicken tikka, the lamb curry (the meat was extremely tender), a paneer dish and a great garlic naan bread
5
Have had several visits here but our last one last week is worthy of a fantastic review. We booked a nice table on the rooftop. I know what some reviewers mean about surly staff as we thought the same in the past but I think it is just their way as they are so busy. Tonight we were greeted very warmly and looked after extremely well. We all had different dishes and each one was exquisite. If I had Our Village around the corner it would be a regular haunt! It's not cheap but I think you are partly paying for the view, which is amazing. Have no hesitation in recommending this restaurant. Hope this is helpfu
5
Best to eat on the first floor in the corner overlooking the river and the city.
Thoroughly enjoyed the delicious food.

It's all about the roof, as you sit having a great curry over looking the quay on a sultry evening with a few beers and a bunch of great friends there really in nothing better.Oh yes and the food if great and the service very attentive too

Hi... I visited this restaurant with family yesterday and was disappointed with this place. Like other reviews (which are bang on), Service & Staff is terrible there. They don't even smile once. Food is very pricey & no where match the standards. Further they are charging Super high price by putting minimum amount spend per person irrespective of food order incl. kids. You would not find this in any high end Indian restaurant in Singapore. View is just ok & not out of the world as this is just on level 5 and not level 30 or 40. To summarize, it is best to avoid it. Would not recommend it.

Came to this restaurant with my overseas friends this evening. Was pleasantly surprised to find it situated on the rooftop in one of the shophouses along Boat Quay. The view of the Singapore River with the Fullerton hotel and Financial Center and the Asian Civilization Museum as backdrop was just astounding. The decor was tastefully done. We ordered the lady's fingers, broccoli, dal as well as some chicken. The food were delicious and just right. They were distinctly flavored. Love it. I have read some of the negative comments but I will still Highly recommend this, especially if one has not been exposed to Sri Lankan cuisine and has only eaten Indian dishes. They are very different but equally yummy. Go try it!

Every aspect of our visit was excellent: food, service, and ambience. We arrived early on a Saturday. We had made a reservation, but in the early hours it may not have been necessary. In any case, we were seated on the top floor covered patio and calling ahead to reserve a spot up there would be wise. Our waiter was attentive and helpful in selecting dishes that would work well together, and all of our food was delivered promptly, fresh from cooking. Watching the sun set and the lights come up over Boat Quay would have made any meal more spectacular.
1
We will never go back.there are 2 of us and small eaters so it was difficult to order food pricing of $40 per head.ask for mango chutney not available.have to pay for a very small amount of mint sauce.every indian restaurant gives this free to all guests.poor service and rude waiters.you know there so many other indian restaurants on boat quay that are much cheaper ,good food and service
3
We we t to catch up with ild friends and we hadn't seen in a long time. The food is over priced but the view and privacy ok. Sadly most of the food was no better than the market food and much more expensive. When we asked for our bill it had several extra items on it that the waiter was reluctant to fix. Not ok then he asked if we were tipping. No not on this occasion!
5
We visited Our Village restaurant five years ago and ever since my husband was refering to it as the place with the world-best tandoori ckicken. What a nice surprise to come back and find the same quality food and beautiful atmosphere there. We just love it! Highly recommendet
4
Great restaurant for entertaining out of town guests or friendly get togethers. Its not your typical curry house, as the restaurant serves highly authentic and freshly prepared dishes not common in most Indian restaurants; the food is so fresh, it can take beyond 30mins to receieve a dish, but it's worth the wait!! The staff are frustratingly rude but they don't care, its actually amusing. Everything you read about them is corret, they're impatiant, snippy and not particularly astute!! Nevertheless, the views are amazing and the food quality is AWSOME, which makes up for the contankerous workforce... an institution!

My husband somehow found Our Village many years ago and fell in love with the good food and awesome view. So, since moving to Singapore it has been our go to restaurant for special nights or taking our friends and family. The service has never been very welcoming or warm, but it wasn't enough to bother me until this last visit. I had family in town for a very short stay, so I thought this would be a special dinner for them. I called and made a reservation for a Saturday night and specifically asked to be on the rooftop, which they confirmed. When we got to the restaurant they did not seat us on the rooftop, but on the floor just below the rooftop that has a wall instead of a panoramic view of Singapore. When I talked to them about it, they said "rooftop not available, you must sit here." No apology, very rude. When we were ready to order, I tried to order 3 drinks (refreshing sandlewood and pomegranate) that my kids and I really liked in the past, but the server said "No! they are very sweet and I will bring you just one to try." I told him that we had tried them before and really liked them. He absolutely would not take my word for it and would only bring one drink, which then of course my kids fought over. He then didn't visit our table again for a long while to even follow up to get the rest of the drink order. By that time, I needed a glass of wine which he quickly told me they were out of until I just kept going down the list...eventually they had one. I ended up ordering multiple dishes for the entire table to share. The server argued with me over the dishes that I ordered (still did not care that I'd been there many times before and knew which dishes that I liked), he told me that every dish was too spicy and actually rolled his eyes at me. He came to our table just before we got our food and said that another table had opened up on the rooftop and that he would move us, which I thought was a nice gesture. But, when the food came he was putting it on our table so I asked if we were still moving tables he just said "No! those people did not pay their bill yet." Again, no apology and never looked me in the face. I am an American female with blonde hair, I have never felt hatred from a server like I did this man. This place was filled with expats who seemed to be treated with almost as much disrespect. It was so humiliating to me that I actually chose to bring my family here to be treated like dirt. What a horrible first impression of Singapore for my family. The view here is awesome and the food is good Indian food (although, I've had just as good for half the price). THE SERVERS HERE CLEARLY DO NOT LIKE EXPATS, THIS PLACE IS JUST NOT WORTH THE DISRESPECT!!

Food was good and the view is great but the service unfortunately is not up to standard. Prices on the high side.
5
Visited with English friends who are living in Singapore, one of their fav places.Agreed, as below, service is a bit slow and they aren't falling over themselves to charm you, but they are honest, and told us if we had ordered too much food.The food was really tasty, tender lamb, lovely kebabs and the mango kulfi was delicious.As for the minimum spend, we weren't even aware of it, but at 40 dollars or whatever people say it is, that's not to difficult to achieve with a starter, main, side and drink.For 4 we spent $258 on 3 courses, sides and multiple alcoholic drinks which we thought was fair
5
What a start to vacation.Regular eating haunt of Singapore based family.Views over Boat Quay at night are simply stunning.Restaurant is a couple of floors above ground level boasting an open terrace with cover.Service was prompt and friendly.The dishes were well prepared and presented.A speciality recommended by the locals is 'egg hoppers', a great way to start a meal.Certainly worth a visit
3
5 friends dined here on a Saturday evening. It took a good 20 minutes before we could order and another 10 minutes before water arrived. They only stock small bottles of sparkling or Stillwater Anyway - we shared lots of different dishes and all were very good, the quality of the lamb good too. The wine menu is limited in its imagination so for any wine connoisseurs maybe think of a beer to accompany your meal. All in all it was a tasty meal in an average environment although we did have the worst table on the rooftop terrace. The waiting staff were okay if somewhat slow to start and definitely on the more hassled and bothered side that the friendly and helpful side. If you are looking for a tasty and inexpensive Indian meal around Boat Quay - book ahead for a good table on the rooftop, order a beer with your food and ignore the pretty poor service!
3
The food can be good and comparable to any good Indian Restaurant. Due to the great views, is an attraction for many corporate team dinners especially the rooftop. Issues were mainly due to the long lead time in serving the orders. It may be good if you are in a large group to pre-order the dishes which can help them plan better. Found prices to be on the higher side.Overall good indian food, great views of the Singapore skyline go there when you want to relax and have it easy but willing to pay a premium
5
This restaurant has great food and a brilliant location. BUT warch the charging! They tell you the prices don't include GST so encourage you to add to the bill then say tip also not included even though there is a 10% service charge! Left a bad taste. There is also a minimum charge which we had no problem meeting but others might find an issue
2
Don't be fooled. This review is based on several consistent bad experiences. In Singapore there are plenty of really good similar food without:. Being charged a minimum approx 40 SGD per person. Yes, a minimum consumption fee is charged, at this less than average restaurant. . The staff is grumpy and bossy from the moment you arrive. Not the kind service you get in most Singaporean restaurants, even the lower end where staff is usually by nature Kind and pleasant. . The food takes forever to actually arrive to the table. About the minimum consumption fee. One can understand they don't want all tables full with people ordering a mango lassi. Fair enough but... Most times I went there, tables are free, to the point an entire floor out of the two floors is not even opened. If that alone doesnt make the restaurant manager rethink the policy what does? We were a group of 6, where 5 had dinner and 1 and a mango lassi and warned in advance that was not going to have dinner. Well, the restaurant does not even consider that to be sufficient and charges the minimum consumption fee to the 6 persons. In a nutshell.The staff single concern is to warn you about the consumption fee to make sure you order more. For that price tag you can easily have far better overall experiences at convenient locations.
5
We love this place! Great food, decent view over the Colonial district and distinctly average service, it's one of our favourite places to bring visitors to.Entering though the archway, heading up in the gaudy, rickety lift and climbing the last flight of stairs, we always love our guests reaction when they step out onto the rooftop and see the view.Food is great and the chicken skewers in particular are a must have - so good that first time we ordered them we had to order more (sorry...can't remember which number!)Service can be pretty hit and miss, but as long as you go in with that expectation then just sit back, enjoy a beer and soak in the view

I know the reviews on Our Village are a bit polarizing, but here is my take. First of all, the view overlooking the Singapore river and Marina Bay is AWESOME! Ask for a table overlooking the river...they usually won't guarantee it, but it helps to ask. The food is also very good, although a bit pricey. My favorite are the kebabs---so moist that they melt in your mouth. Next, the service is a bit mixed. We had a great young waiter who was a delight to talk with, but the manager can be a bit abrasive...I think he forgot his customer service pill. Lastly, as I mentioned before, the prices are a bit high for what you get, but when I add in the amazing view, I think it represents good value. I will continue coming back
4
As many reviews mention, some staff members are grumpy, the menu and walls are full of rules for customers, and the food takes some time to arrive. But put it down to this place being quirky. And if you can put up with that, the food is great and the view of the Singapore river the best in the city. If the service is slow that is because they actually cook it fresh rather than heating up something frozen. My Singapore friends always take me there when I visit and it is a special place - including the sometimes bizarre service.
1
As an Avid Indian food lover I have tried many different restaurants around the world. For restaurant quality this place doesn't even come close, better flavors and quality at a food court. The prices aren't anywhere near to where they should be considering they charge you for extra condiments/sauces/refills. Service was crap, never again! There are some fantastic places for Indian food in Singapore so don't bother with this one
4
For lovers of Indian food this could possibly become your go to Indian. Set a few floors up in a shophouse above Boat Quay with a fantastic view, you could be anywhere. The noise and hustle and bustle from the bars and restaurants along Boat Quay are a world away. The food is excellent and they really try with the service but just miss the mark on that front. Both the food and wine are very reasonably priced for such a beautiful location. Be sure to ask for a table on the rooftop and please don't tell anyone else about it!
4
This is also another return event. Once again a great evening on National Day with good food and a great view. The menu is extensive and the food should be shared so you can try more of everything, go early and enjoy your time on the roof and enjoy the view. Enjoy
4
Visited with expat friends who recommended this place.Weird stuff 1st:- there is a min spend per person ($36 i think):- This place has no online presence (which i think i quite like);- Menu keeps track of number of order of each dish made since 1995...(appeals to my inner number cruncher);- Apparently won't alter any of the dishes on the menu (not sure if i like this or not)Good stuff:- Amazing views from the rooftop;- Food was very niceBill for 4 was $200 inc beers wine (Â£25/head uk prices) which wasn't too extortionate.You'd never know this place existed unless you were taken
5
We were on the roof with a nice view of the quay--and a welcome breeze. The set of instructions was long, but were there to set patron's expectations. I have to disagree with the reviewer below who was put off by the minimum requirement of $38 per person. This is a small business. If you want a cheap Indian meal, go elsewhere, where you'll get food that has been simmering all day and where, as a result, the shrimp will be tough. Our meal was delicious--the best we had in Singapore.. Service was very good. I have no idea what some other reviewers are complaining about. The patrons in the table next to us said that they are regulars
4
We were seated on the rooftop so had fantastic views. Menu a bit strange as it shows how many times the dishes had been chosen! I went for the speciality chicken and it was absolutely delicious - just melted in the mouth. Service wasn't the quickest but I would rather wait and know the food is being freshly cooked. Staff friendly and happy to answer questions and give advice. Food and drink very reasonably priced
1
I went there with my family to celebrate a special occasion. We were 5 adults and 1 child. We ordered 3 main dishes, breads, raita, starter and alcoholic drinks. The waitstaff after taking our order told us he needs to check if our bill meets the min spend requirement of $38++ Per head. He returned saying we are $78 short so we need to order more food. We told him that we may order more drinks or dessert later but can't order now. He refused and said we must order now. We requested to speak with the manager who was extremely rude to us as soon as he arrived. We asked if they can make an exception as the restaurant was empty and it was late Sun evening. He refused and said they will charge us the full required amount if we don't meet the min spend. We tried to reason it out with them. But he totally refused and asked us to leave!!!! I have lived in SG for 6 years and eaten at many restaurants of different cuisines but never experienced such rude behaviour. Would not recommend anyone to visit this horrible restaurant with the most terrible staff.
4
Reserve a table on the rooftop for dinner for the river/city views and you won't be disappointed. The restaurant is excellent and cheap, especially for Boat Quay, just along from Dallas bar, through a passageway and elevator up to level 5.There are better Indian restaurants in Singapore, but not with this view. I recommend the: Murgh Makhanwala, delicious and spicy chicken in coconut cream; spicy chicken (Kukad) Vindaloo; and stand out Bhuna Gosht, spicy lamb in a succulent sauce.Pricing is excellent and you will not be ripped-off with Boat Quay prices here.Highly recommend. We will be back
5
Went for dinner a couple of weeks ago with friends. The food was excellent and the service extremely friendly. Rooftop setting is really nice.!One suggestion would be work on advertising! I must have walked passed this place 1000 times over the years and never knew it was there. Well worth a visit. You won't be disappointed
1
We are returning Singapore residents and we're looking forward to visiting an old favourite haunt where we have had many an enjoyable meal over the years. Forget it !! We should have known something was amiss when the place was empty on a Friday evening and we were given the best riverside table without a reservation. We were handed menus which required us to read several warnings and provisos before ordering, namely that there was a minimum charge of $36 per person, that there was a minimum order of at least two pieces of anything itemised by the piece, warning that there was a minimum wait time of at least half an hour, warning us short staff issues, and finally to cap it all a suggestion that tipping was entirely acceptable!! At first we thought that this was some kind of joke, until the waiter demanded rather than asked for our drinks order, and then proceeded to tell us that two of the three choices of wine by the glass were unavailable. We became increasingly uncomfortable and decided to leave. It was a good decision. We had a superb North Indian meal at an alternative restaurant with charming service at a riverside table. So sad to see the demise of an old favourite however.We will not be going back
1
Very bad indian food. No spice, no taste. Far from being authentic. Curry is microwaved and they added water. No taste at all. This restaurant should be closed and the chef fired.
4
Food was fabulous. Rooftop views are amazing. Service was very polite but very slow! So just chill out, relax aand enjoy- the drinks and food will arrive eventually :-)
5
Okay, the service is a bit slow and to the point but the food and the view more than make up for it! The lamb kebab is a must and the butter chicken and channa masala are gorgeous!All reasonably priced.Would recommend booking a table and requesting the roof top if you're visiting on the weekend.Lovely for couples, family, friends... been several times and everybody loves it
1
I am amazed at the audacity of the racism of their staff against the Indian community! Not sure why it is but they continuously misbehaved with my parents who were visiting from India. I was a fan of their food but it is against my principles to spend a cent on people showing no respect to customers!The waiting time varies depending upon the skin Colour and rules are different as well. They would pretend to not hear you if you ask for a glass of water but they would come running in if they hear 'wine'. Your luck with water would be great if your skin colour is not brown! The funniest situation was when they refused to reduce the amount of spices for our table saying that they don't put much anyways and can't change their recipe but 20 mins later they readily took the order of an American group who asked to reduce the spice level!I am embarrassed and ashamed that I recommended this restaurant to a few friends and colleagues before due to their food! If you do not warrant racism of any kind, my sincere recommendation would be not to visit this place! The food quality is matched by many restaurants in the city
5
Forget the bad service and order the Palek Paneer and Butter Chicken. The garlic naan bread was bland but the Sri Lankan style rice was fantastic. Definitely the best Indian restaurant in Singapore. Service is slow and generally bad but the food more than makes up for it.
1
On top of a minimum spend required, the staff were arrogant and racist. I brought my Indian family friends there (being the only table with indians, the rest were either expats or tourists) and the waiters totally ignored us after multiple attempts to catch their attention. Furthermore, with a vegetarian family who doesn't take alcohol, it was impossible to hit the minimum spend. The food quality was good. Healthy, little oil and they use good ingredients. But definitely not worth the embarrassment or discrimination. I will never go back again. I do not agree with the way they treat people and there are better Indian food elsewhere
4
All the curries at this lovely rooftop restaurant are gluten free, apparently, and plain rice is available. I have to keep to a gluten free diet to remain well, as I have Coeliac Disease, so this restaurant, in a city where it's difficult for me to eat, was a real find and the view was a bonus. I'd definitely recommend it
4
Have to know where the entrance to this place is along the Boat Quay array of restaurants. Up for floors, great views over Boat Quay extending to Marina Bay Sands. Food was very good and reasonably priced for Singapore, all in all very enjoyable and would go again. Even a bit of a light show from Marina Bay Sands late
2
I visited with 3 colleagues after work. The entry to the place is quite easy to miss, other than the staff member blocking the doorway. He eyed us all up from head to toe, then nodded and moved aside once he had ‘approved’ of our dress. The restaurant has a “strictly smart casual” dress-code. It was like entering a nightclub, a bouncer on the main door, then you walk towards a tiny lift which is guarded by another man.Take the lift to the 5th floor, where you will see signs saying “strictly no photography”. I’ve never seen anything like this in a restaurant before, and personally, I thought it set the tone for the whole evening. (I get that you don't want groups of people with selfie-sticks stood on the rooftop, but they seriously need to chill out).Rules absolutely everywhere. We were sat at our table, and immediately told that there was a SGD40 minimum spend per person. Seeing as each dish was around SGD20, and drinks expensive, that wasn't going to be a problem! I appreciate that they don't want people sat there for hours, taking in the view, and only ordering one drink (the rooftop section is small with only a few tables). But if I was going to do that, I’d head to any of the rooftop bars nearby! (Lantern, Kinki, Altitude…).The rules continued. When trying to order a starter, I was bluntly told by the waiter that there was a “minimum order” on samosas. I only wanted one, but had to buy two. Why not just change to menu to say “2 samosas, $X” rather than have to tell customers that there is a minimum spend!? The samosas were in fact delicious (although too big for me to eat both) but the ‘ordeal’ made the place seem tacky, and left a sour taste in the mouth. It seemed that they were just after our money, and nothing else!After our starter, it took around 25-30 minutes for a waiter to take our main course order. My female colleague asked on three separate occasions, but was simply ignored. In the end, I got up and went over to the waiter myself. The service was truly awful – up there with the worst I have experienced in Singapore.When the mains eventually came, they were tasty, but nothing to write home about. The naan bread was definitely the best part!The bill for 4 of us came to around SGD270.00, which I thought was pricey. The waiter came over to collect cash that we had placed on the table. He then proceeded to count the cash in front of us (twice!). It may have been completely innocent, but it certainly felt as if he was checking that we hadn’t underpaid. Again, something I have never witnesses in a restaurant before.If you want authentic and tasty Indian/Sri Lankan food, head to Little India. In particular, Lagnaa Barefoot Dining. The food is incredible and the service puts this place to shame.I will not be returning to Our Village, and hope that they concentrate more on their food and service, rather than their endless rules and policies
1
Arrogance, a menu with unwritten conditions dictating how much of what should u eat is not what one expects in hospitality industry. More than that staff just refuses to show any customer empathy. ..all just stating policies. Wonder whether u walk in to a simple Dhaba to enjoy food or to make zome high end investment where u need to read the offer document carefully which is not even written.
4
The service is always a bit suspect but delicious food in an ideal setting on the river. Not the easiest place to find and the menu is challenging, but worth the effort.
5
Great place, both vegetarian and non vegetarian Indian food. Away from the hectic quay s ( pronounce keys in SIN ) on a rooftop.
5
My husband and I went here on the recommendation of our travel agent. We owe her a bottle of wine as thanks!The location, rooftop, is magical. The staff very good and the food. Aaahh. The food was sublime. We told our favourite Indian restaurant owners, here in NZ, about this place and encouraged them to check it out next time they're in Singapore. We loved everything about Our Village
2
Fabulous location. Difficult menu. Only when our table of 7 asked for the bill after the first round of drinks did a senior staff member intervene and rearrange the table for us. I wanted to leave and spend our hard earned cash elsewhere but was persuaded to stay. Mistake. Suffering from Delhi belly now
3
If you are looking for a good rooftop restaurant this is the one, the menu is extensive but check with the waiters what you are ordering, the food is tasty but can be quite hot and is not always what you expect. However the view is magnificent and a great way to spend an evening
3
If you are looking for authentic or good value Indian food, I'm afraid this is not it. Head to "Little India", where there a plethora of cheaper, better restaurants, Apollo banana leaf being one of the most reliable. This is a restaurant that caters for tourists or expats with more money than sense. The view is spectacular, with aromantic ambience but the food is merely OK and service, as many have pointed out...fairly grumpy.
5
Our Village offers the best Indian culinary experience in India. The food is delicious and light. The rooftop ambience is relaxing and inviting. The staff are all Indian men who are knowledgeable, curteous and friendly. Price is more than reasonable. My review is based upon many visits over recent years. They never miss a beat.
4
Having read other reviews about service not being good, I was pleasantly surprised. Our waiter was friendly and made suggestions when asked. Booked in advance, had table on highest rooftop (there are 2 upper floors) with view of boat quay and partial view of Marina Bay Sands light show. Food was very nice, not overly spicy, cost 260 sing for 4 people with starters, mains and 2 jugs of beer. Would come again
1
Been here numerous times mainly for the view. Tonight I took a friend who was visiting me on holiday.When they realised a member of our party had cancelled, they put pressure on us to move to a smaller table with less of a view. I will add that we had our wine and had ordered our meal by this time..I'd stated that the place wasn't busy but they really pressured us to move. In hindsight, we should have walked out.The restaurant was pretty much empty for the rest of the evening so our move was unnecessary.Food was mediocre, service was seriously bad. They didn't even stop people sitting outside despite haze being bad in Singapore. PSI was over 200 tonight but they didn't stop the small amount of people there sitting outside
1
We visited on a Saturday evening. The staff were surly and only seemed concerned that we spend above the required minimum of $36 per head. I had a chicken kebab which was served luke warm to cold. When I asked politely to have it warmed up the waiter was downright rude. They literally reheated the same food and it arrived back 20 minutes later when the rest of the meal was cold. No apology or even a hint of friendliness. We asked for water ( we had also ordered beer) and it took four repeated requests before it came. Will not be going back
5
Had a really nice meal here. Requested a table outside and got one overlooking Boat Quay. Service was good and the food was lovely. A gem hidden among a tourist filled area.
5
Our favourite restaurant in Singapore, and up to now somewhat been a hidden gem!! We've been coming here when on vacation for several years now and absolutely love it. Just hope it does not become too popular!!

I feel I know my Indian restaurants and this is one of the worlds best. on boat quay amidst the melee of bars etc it is on the rooftops and above the level below by a long shot. Really it's worth a try, the menu is expansive so adventure and you won't be disappointed

We ate here with our two children on New Year's Eve 2014. We booked our table for 9pm and was seated promptly. The restaurant was packed and staff rushed off their feet but they managed to serve us perfectly, regardless. The food was amazing, impeccably cooked and extremely moorish - the various breads were yummy and curries among some of the best we've had. We were sat on the roof, had an amazing view of the river and the lively atmosphere all made for a very memorable evening

Roof deck dining on the 5th floor over the main drag in Boat Quay. This North Indian restaurant has pretty good food, but the main reason to go is to sit outside and enjoy the - a partial view of Marina Sands and the light show at night and overlooking the river. A little hard to find the entrance from the street - and then it's an small elevator and a few flights of stairs to reach the roof top. One thing to note there was a "per person minimum" of S$35 each -not too hard to reach but still worth knowing in advance

We have been to this restaurant on a number of visits to Singapore, usually on a Friday night after meeting up with friends in Boat Quay. The food is great, let's get that straight, but the service has always been underwhelming - slow, uninterested waiters who are reluctant to share insights as to which dishes to order. However, on our most recent visit, we were beyond disappointed. We waited over an hour for our food, and our repeated enquiries were met with the same answer each time - "just 5 minutes more!". A realistic estimation of the time, and some kind of genuine acknowledgment of our frustration, would have been gratefully received. In the end, we were too annoyed to even enjoy the meal, which came with a $200 price tag for 3 people (we kept ordering beers to pass the time) and not even an offer of a free drink. To add insult to injury, we asked to split the bill as 2 of us were claiming expenses, and the 2 bills didn't add up to the amount we paid, but they refused to reissue a correct one! A long and disappointing evening overall and we won't be back

First the charitable. Food is good.That's it ! This must count as the worst restaurant in terms of service i have ever been to. We reached at 1:30pm for lunch and had a really tough time ordering food as they close at 1:45 for lunch ! Why did they sest us in the first place i don't get. We asked for a repeat order of indian bread at about 1:45 as a running order. The waiter's rude response ' will this be it or you will be ordering more food?'None of the ageing waiters smile and make it a point to make you feel.unwanted and unwelcome.Not to mention that there are boards put up everywhere on what patrons cannot do. They really treat customers as a nuisance and are the unfriendliest pack i have come across. If you come strictly between the time absolutely convenient to them you will be fine but if you reach 30mins before their closing time you had it. Never ever go here for special occasions...probability of their ruining it for you is definitely high.It's been a really long time that i have had something so bad to write about any restaurant. Believe me i took time to search this hotel on tripadvisor and review it just to prevent other diners suffering the same fate as us. Check out one of the signs they have put up in their restaurant...it smacks of their smug attitude

This is what one would call a hidden Gem in Boat Quay. Unless you go looking for it, its easy to miss the small door that leads to the lift that leads you to the roof top restaurant. It's my favorite to take those who want Indian food. The food is what shines, it's just right. not too oily, not to chewy, and both north and south Indian curries are done correct. The restaurant also has nice ambiance and if seated on the roof top, a good view of the singapore river. Alcohol choice can be limited and they have license restrictions.

We visited this restaurant after hearing from several friends that the atmosphere was excellent. We chose this restaurant for a family dinner and were slightly apprehensive after reading a couple of reviews that were critical of the service. We did not experience any negative service at all. In fact, the wait staff were quite attentive. The food was very good and the outlook excellent. The food was expensive compared with other Indian restaurants in Singapore however; if you can sit on the rooftop it is well worth it. I suggest you arrive just before sundown which allows you to experience the views in very different lights

After nearly 3 years, I have just discovered one off the best curry retauarants which offers a similar northern style curry very similar to the curries I get back in the UK. They have proper naan bread, tender chicken breast with no chewy gristly stuff, provide a good service and have a fine view from the open top restaurant on the 5th floor along boat quay overlooking the river and business district
