Huge burger patties, lots of "specialty" burger choices, and the option to build your own burger. Great fries to go with. And, many yummy food choices besides burgers. Bring your appetite!
5
Likes the type of burgers offered at this restaurant which has a wide range from Beef, chicken, mutton and pork. You can make your own burger as well!

Big portions, not necessary to get sides.
Juicy meat, good fries.
No complaints accept that you cannot pay with credit card.

Had burger here! Portion are generous! Favourful and well cooked! Friendly service and good juicy burger!!
5
Good choice of location for relaxation. Burger portion is big. Juicy and soft patties. Ambience around it is good. Would definitely come back for more.
4
A lovely burger packed with the 'bow!' Great food and just a burger is far more than enough. No need side orders or extra folks.

One of the best burgers I've ever had and cheap beer (for Singapore). A must do for a late lunch üëåüèª

First time at this burger joint and I was quite impressed. Went just after they opened so it was empty and peaceful. I had the monster mash, which was much more filling then I expected. It wasn't the prettiest burger but the fried chicken was almost double the size of the burger and with a side of chips it was good value! The mozzarella sticks and truffle chips were average but still yum
5
Always enjoy going to this restaurant located at the roll of shop houses along upper Thomas road opposite the CC. They serve one of the best burgers and have a wide choices to select from beef, mutton, chicken and pork. You can even make your own which is nice! Like the milk shake which taste like the traditional America milk shake! BRTon

Very good concept and right pricing - I was sitting right next to the waterfront so the scenery was great too. The service was good. The packaging and delivery to the table is more in the fast-food style but the taste and quality is more in line with the gourmet burger style. I had the double double bacon and cheese: taste was good but it was missing a bit of the extra seasoning that makes a gourmet burger waooo. Fries were ok, on the dry side. The Scottish IPA was nice and also well priced. Overall very good.
4
Burgers are GOOD and have nice names too. staff is attentive and friendly. Place can be crowded so better call them before going there
4
Great service, and massive burgers make this a worthwhile place to visit for dinner.
Reasonable prices and quality food and drinks.
Easiest way to get here is by Cab, however you can walk from Marymount MRT, or busses are nearby.
4
Came to this place with High Expectations on the food. Wasn't blown away. A little too salty for my liking but like the ambience a lot. Good selection of drinks and music - Beatles mostly.
5
Food was soooo good
The chicken ceaser burger was amazing
My partner had the spiciest one they do (can't remember the name) he loved it also
Nice environment inside
5
Had dinner here! Great food and great burgers, hardy and tastefully done! Great fries too!! Friendly service !
4
Good American Style Food , loaded with calories but hits the spot when you need comfort food - great place to chill with friends and when craving for a good burger
4
Went with a friend to the outlet at McDonald house.Ordered ice lemon tea, a burger, salted egg soft shell crab pasta, truffle fries with cheese.- Burger not bad esp with addition of sun dried tomatoes- Pasta bad. Did not have the richness of salted egg. Think it is more egg than salted egg- Truffle fries. So so - Home made lemon tea. Ok. Friend has 2 portionsVerdict - if one is in Burger place order the burger only pleas
4
Fat Boy's is a really great break from the ubiquitous McDonalds and Burger Kings...a serious burger; not cheap, but few things in Singapore are - if you get the craving for more than the mouthful offerings at the fast food chains, Fat Boy's is the place to go
4
We shared their specialty burger, Fat Basterd & topped up the fries to chili fries... boy, were they so good! Also had their Chicken Mac & Cheese & Meatball Bolognese which the kids loved very much. & for dessert, we shared a tantalizing butter & maple syrup waffle with vanilla ice cream. Great food & not too pricey
1
It felt really hostile how they treated us there.1.They asked me to sign the receipt but my CREDIT CARD was MISSING?In 5 minutes they lost my card.2. I patiently waited but was asked to LEAVE THE RESTAURANT WITHOUT MY CARD TWICE!3. I was distressed and alarmed of their lack of effort to fix their fault, so I demanded they look for it.4. The staff ANGRILY searched for it, he was throwing a TANTRUM and tossing boxes everywhere to look for it.5. When he found it, HE SLAMMED MY CARD so hard on the table and turned his back at me.6. We thought this was VERY DISRESPECTFUL yet he kept SHOUTING AT US LIKE IT WAS OUR FAULT!7. I took a video of him shouting at me as evidence, then he seemed to calm down BUT NO APOLOGY.I have nothing to gain from this review, but I really think it was unacceptable they have staff WHO ARE OUT OF CONTROL. I would have avoided this place if I knew I would be SO STRESSED
4
If you are a fan of hamburgers and fancy meat burgers, this is the place for you. As I'm not particularly interested in burgers, it was an ok place for me.
3
The burgers here taste good. Pity they were way to greasy. Service can also be improved. Servers were all black face.. why so unhappy?
5
Good service esp by the Indian uncle! Humourous and gave a foc cake for my friend who is celebrating her birthday. Burger is too big for 1. Hard time finishing food but its nice!
4
Good range of burgers for different appetites. Good size. Like that they have vegetarian choices. Nice and relaxed place.
4
The burger taste quite good but portion can be big for average size, the rest of the drink is quite normal. . Parking can be challenging at this area, so need to park further and do some walking , other else by other transport should be OK.
5
I would always come down here with my friends for our burger fix. Food was always on point. Milkshakes are amazing! Although most of the staffs should have service enhancement, I can see that there was a slight improvement. Just last night I ate there, and we were served by an indian guy. He was very polite, friendly and professional. I can see that he has been hosting, cashiering and taking order, but he keeps smiling and working, unlike those other staffs he is with whom were kinda blur. Anyway, they have the best burgers! Will definitely come back
4
We had heard the fuss on this place and decided to find out for ourselves. Arrived with 2 hungry teens and had to wait on the line(6pm on a Sunday night - not surprising) but it did to take too long to get us seated.The place was packed with all sorts of patrons from all backgrounds. The place is small but once seated you can get quick service and an awesome burger. Take the combo's offered or build your own. Come hungry.. I think they have a great business in delivery judging by the number of riders waiting to take food which was a delay to our order - only downside.
1
The ambience was nice but sad to say not the food. The fish used for their Fish and Chips was not fresh. The oil used has not been filtered as there were black spots found on the crust of the fish. Chippy's beer battered fish taste better. anytime. The Honey Mustard Chicken Kebab was bbq till dry and not worth its price
5
So I've been here a couple of times now . I order mostly the same thing every time I'm there . And I am NEVER disappointed . The Milkshake . Vanilla with Caramel . It's heaven with a touch of ..... More heaven . It's perfection on every level . Not too sweet. Normal milkshakes always come off as too "solid" and tough to drink through the straw but not this one . I'm watering in my mouth just writing about it.Now the burger . With a whole lot of ingredients for you to custom make your own burger, it'll have you coming back, not just cause the combinations mostly rock, but cause there's always something else you wanna try. I have had a burger with every cheese they had on they menu and it was great!! . Ok look guys , you have to head down to an outlet. They've got a few around now so go for it!!!
5
Dropped in at about 2100 one night for a burger. Burgers were so good that we went back a couple of nights later and had to wait in line for a table. Definitely worth the wait, burgers are made fresh, they are a little different or you can make your own from the list of ingredients. So much choice and washed down with a cold beer makes a great end to any day
4
Delicious burgers at an affordable price. Great for families and small groups. Ordered the Burgatory burger at the Holland V. Must try.
4
A burger is a burger. However, at Fat Boys the burgers are different. Not oily yet juicy. Their huge french fries complements their burgers well.
2
Went to the Holland Village outlet for a late evening burger, the staff weren't interested in serving us at first but after they did the food came out very quickly, it was cold and looked like it had been thrown onto the plate. This place isn't cheap and we expected more - very disappointing, won't be going back
3
Had dinner at the East Coast branch. Service was fast, nice atmosphere. Large variety of choices of burgers. Ordered Caesar salad, Mac & cheese, Bushtucker, Honey mustard chicken kebab, Burgertory. There was meat, meat & more meat ! Ordered the Caesar salad to try to balance the meal, but it came with lots of grilled chicken ! A bit too much I feel. Mac & cheese was nice with large sized macaroni. The Bushtucker patty tasted suspiciously like it had alcohol, but I wasn't sure if there really was. The kebab was tasty too. My husband complained about being thirsty all night after eating the Burgertory. Guess there was too much MSG. All said, it's a nice place for meat lovers to indulge.
3
Had tried the branch at Douby Ghaut. Ordered The Yolo and Bushtuckers. Had tried to call to reserve a table but was told that after 6.30pm, they do not take in reservation. Hence, we have to walk in. Lucky enough that we managed to get a seat. It took us about 30minutes before the burger arrived. The fries and the bun were cold. Only the spam and the meat patty were hot. Nothing interesting on the taste. While there are other option available, this will not be considered.
3
Decided I need a good burger and had enough of the fine dinning for while whilst on holiday in Singapore.The place is cool and relaxed, great milksakes, but my well done burger was pink, so I had to send it back, and when they remade it, whilst it was well done, I found it a little tasteless, like it hadn't been seasoned.A bit of a disappointment really, and still searching for a good old fashioned cheeseburger
3
Went to the outlet at East Coast at the recommendation of a friend. Location is nice and easy to find. It was a Saturday afternoon and it wasn't busy (about 2pm), so we enjoyed the fact that it's quiet and the girls can have a good chat. Ordered the Mac n Cheese and Meat Balls. Mac n Cheese was terribly bland, the cheese used was not great and overall a bad dish. The Meat Balls on the other hand, while slightly better in taste, wasn't any better either. Drinks were fine and when I spilt my drink, I had to wave for the waitress to provide me with more napkins, no effort/initiative from her to assist (not that I needed any) even though she was day-dreaming when the accident happened. She was polite nonetheless, so can't quite fault her. Overall, the service is mediocre so given the not-so-good food, it wasn't a great experience. We will be back for drinks since the place is lovely to hang out. Food-wise, will not recommend.

I visited the Fat Boys - Burger Bar on 31 May 2016, which is my fourth visit over the last year. With each visit, I have found the burger to be less and less appealing (even though it was fun to be able to customize my burger) but on this last visit, their lack of shame for marketing an out-to-date promotion completely disgusted me. On 31 May (a Monday), I visited the outlet as I knew they have "Free bacon Mondays". The display for "Free bacon Mondays" was still prominently shown on the iPad that customers use to order food from. When I enquired the manner in which I could add the free bacon, the junior staff was a little clueless, so she spoke to the supervisor (maybe she was even the manager). I was told the promotion was over. She could not tell me when the promotion ended, just vaguely telling me it was "months ago". When the supervisor came to the counter, I asked her again. This lady was arrogant in insisting that "ALL my customers" knew about the end of the promotion. She even insisted that this is an "on going" promotion and "we run it from time to time" when in fact, the promotion is over and there was no valid excuse to customers into believing that the promotion was still ongoing. Her blatantly unapologetic, deceptive practice put a complete end to any future visit to Fat Boys at any location in Singapore. To top off this particularly frustrating visit, there was a particular corner of the eatery that smelled like toilet as it was located next to the staff toilet. When told about it, the staff could not bother less. I saw no attempt to even investigate the matter. All in all, I found the outlet's lack of integrity to be a complete put-off.In terms of food, I found the beef burgers to be so-so only -- better than McDonald's but pricier than Carl's Jr and not as satisfying as Carl's Jr. Lamb burger with blue cheese sauce was my favourite. Fried mozzarella stick was stringy but quite hard, not melt-in-your-melt version
3
I tried the one at balestier Zhongshan mall. I ordered a cheese burger with drinks and chips for about $13. The restaurant is simply furnished. The burger is big but not to my liking and taste. The drinks is from bottle and not from can which I don't really like
4
I really enjoyed the atmosphere at Fat Boys, the DIY concept is great as you can chose meat, sauce etc. They have different locations around town which is very convenient when craving a burger. You will do your order via a tablet where you can also Build Your Own Burger (BYOB
5
Seriously im almost vegan but this burger is blowing my mind away! I dont even trust meat anywhere anymore but this mince meat is heavenly juicy well balanced with the cheese the srooms the bun.. Everything combining perfection.. Well ok especially if u r starving..!
4
Disrupting the Burger market in Singapore Keep up the good work, yet to have a bad burger, Boat Quay great venue, the lamb burger my favourite
3
Visited with my wife. Volume was sufficient. Source was little bid sweet to me. Meat was nice taste. It was ok to me. They will never disappoint you
2
The service is highly disoriented. Not much crowd and missed my order. Food is average. Worse sausages I've eaten. Never tried the beer. Root beer float is average.
5
Tried their burgers at Holland V, Upper Thomson, and Marina branches. Every branches never turn me down. Good n nice burger.
Note: not for small eaters.
3
The burgers are nice, especially like the "Create Your Own Burger" and the Beer Batter Onion Rings. Relax atmosphere and huge glass of drinks. Wonderful but watch your fats! Too greasy!!
1
Had been to the one (no TripAdvisor entry) next to Dhoby Ghaut - since they are a chain - all the same. The burger was really poor in quality (had the wimpy one) like the beef, sauce was just standard Heinz BBQ sauce, and the bread was not toasted at all. My friends had the one with pineapple. They tasted the juice and could tell it came out of the tin. Overall very disappointment.
1
We went to the Orchard road branch after reading some positive reviews and were astounded by the poor quality bad food. The french fries seemed old, badly made in bad quality oil. The burgers tasted bad and we immediately had a serious heartburn,There place did not seem very clean.WOW what poor quality, we will never come back
4
This burger bar gives off a very American vibe, from the burger names to the burgers themselves. I have never eaten burgers outside of McDonalds, Burger King, Etc. but their burgers were really good! The burgers can be quite costly, with an average price of $13 per burger. Also, the menu may seem small but each burger appears to be unique in their own way. The service was swift and the orders also came very quickly, even though I visited during dinner time
5
Tried the "fat b*sterd" dish at Holland V yesterday, about 20 bucks for an enormous portion you could probably share. Worth every penny as the food was delicious, saw a lot of tables trying out the chicken wings, so I went to check out the prices, and it was also affordable at $12 for 10 pcs or something?Will be trying the chicken wings the next time I come over.Good food + good prices
4
The burger is one of the best I tried. The beef is grilled perfectly and very juicy. Crispy bacon on top creating different feeling all together. French fries is so crispy
5
Top quality (as in delicious) burgers. Great atmosphere in Holland Village and reasonably priced food and drinks make this a worthwhile spot.
5
The burger was really taste good, great to recommend to your friends and family, cozy place to eat...
4
Don't think this place is as good as omakase, but a regular haunt of mine now. i like the ability to make my own burger, allows me to change different things based on mood.
4
This isn't fine dining but when you feel like a good burger, Fat Boy's at Holland is great. You can build your own burger to suit your tastes. The atmosphere is very good. the only down side is that the service is a bit variable. The part time girls are a bit uninterested but the guy with the big ''tash is one of the best. We all really enjoyed this and the price was reasonable too
5
... Was my initial reaction when the server first laid down our order on the table. We had ordered two burgers: the Wimpy Kid, and the Jamaican Me Hungry. We chose those on the basis of the patty (beef -- juicy, meaty, delicious beef), and the fixings inside (both had crispy bacon). Both did not disappoint.There is also an option to create your own burger, where you choose everything from the type of bread, to the meat, down to any and all fixings and sauces you want on your burger. My inner OC-ness was triggered happy by this, but I was too hungry to try it. I would have ended up ordering everything. Maybe next time. They came with fries, and lettuce and tomatoes on the side. The fries were also delicious -- crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. The staff were also nice, all polite and smiling. We asked for both burgers to be split in half, and our request was granted no questions asked.PS: I'm referring to the Orchard branch, which I couldn't find here on TripAdvisor. There is always a queue when I pass by this place, and now I know why.

I have been a regular patron of Fat Boys for years now. Their menu is crafted to make any burger lover to drool. Freshly made patties, variety of sauces to go along with the patties, add-on likes caramelized onions, sun-dried tomatoes, variety of cheeses and buns! Pick a burger from their menu or DIY. Your burger comes along with thick cut fries.They have other food items like mac and cheese, fish and chips, soups and salads to please every palette. They serve fantastic thick milkshakes too. Overall, Fat Boys is one of the best burger joints in SG.

We continued our journey to explore eating places along Pasir Panjang Rd towards West Coast Rd. Last weekend we decided to visit this place called "Fat Boys" burger restaurant. Quite easy to find and with convenient parking along one of the lanes beside the shop houses that the restaurant is located.They have interesting names for their burgers - we ordered a "Fat B**stard", "Swiss Schroom", "Cheese Royale" and "Wimpy". You can also make your own burger by selecting the type of meat, additional items such egg, bacon and toppings. Each burger comers with potato fries. Service is minimal as diners help themselves to ice water. Order is taken by the staff and then food is served with minimal interaction. The place is quite family friendly. We saw a few groups with young kids. The burgers are quite tasty and is an adult size meal. Taken with the fries, that would be more than sufficient. But there are always the big eaters who can eat more. We had a good family catching up and topped our meal time with beer as well. Next place to explore will be..

Happened to drop in late one night when most other eateries are closed.I was impressed by the quality of the burger : cooked as requested , and you can customize the add ons.Another good thing about fat boys is that they serve draft Stella - was $10+ for a pint at happy hour ( all evening mid week )- so having a pint with your burger and fries is an improvement over a lot of other places.Pricing was around $12 for the burger n fries ... Which seems about right considering the quality , and table service. Will go back agai

Generally, either I don‚Äôt finish or I struggle to finish a burger. The one at ‚ÄúFat Boys‚Äù though is a different story. I gobbled all my burger up! Needless to say, I really did enjoy my ‚Äúwimpy‚Äù And for those who are a bit on the experimental side, you can make your very own burger, too. They have a section in their menu where you can select individual toppings to allow the diners to personalize their burger meal. Prices of the dishes range from 5 SGD (soup of the day) to 20 SGD. Most of the burgers though are from 11SGD ‚Äì 19.80 SGD. Every plates of burger come with chunky-juicy-crispy fries. I‚Äôd say all in all, it‚Äôs very much affordable. For 3pax that ordered a burger of our choice plus drinks, we‚Äôve paid about 65 SGD. With a happy stomach and pleasant experience due to staff‚Äôs friendly service, it‚Äôs definitely a good value for money. Btw, we went to Holland Village Branch 
5
Amazing flavour of original burgers and hand cut chips just perfect, cool atmosphere, really cold draft beer in a cold pint too, service with a smile as a bonus. A must to visit if you are in Singapore.
4
Great Food, Great Service, Amazing atmosphere! Had a 'Holy Caesar' burger and was blown away! Fries were a little too salty for me, and the ice tea a bit watery, but apart from that, it was FANTASTIC!!
4
Great selection of burgers here as well as some other food. Amongst the best of the burgers in Singapore and reasonably priced as well (for Singapore, that is -- still expect to pay more than in other nearby countries). The Blue Cheese Burger was excellent.
4
Hearty and unusual burgers at reasonable prices. They have some other bites that don't really matter. The most interesting aspect of the menu is make your own burger. Great for the break away binge
4
Burgers are great, lots of different kinds to choose from, they have more locations now which makes it a lot easier to access.
4
The place with cheeky message on the way out is one of the places to be for the burger aficionados in Singapore. This is my second time to this place and I ordered the delectable Meaty Meaty Meatballs, which is basically pork and beef minced meat, topped with gravy sauce and a scoop of mashed potatoes. The sauce is sufficiently sweet but a bit runny for my taste. The shake is quite alright though there is a place for better shakes in Singapore.As it gets crowded during the normal meal times, try going to the place a little bit later. I went with my friend around 9pm and we got in quite quickly with only one group ahead of us. But definitely, this place should be visited at least once as they also have the localised burger menu which I have yet to try
2
In looking at the menu I was excited for a great burger. It wasn't to be. The restaurant was clean and the staff friendly and attentive. Good American oldies playing in the background. The burger was just average, a bit over cooked and the fries were not fresh but came from a frozen bag. Also ordered an appetizer which arrived after the the main courses. I am a hamburger connoisseur and have had many great ones and this just didn't come close to the mark
2
We visited the MacDonald House branch to have dinner before catching a movie. Ordered the following: Royale with Cheese, Wimpy Beef, Fish n' Chips, Parmesan with Truffle Oil Fries, a Chocolate Milkshake and Coke. Total cost was $65. Feedback below: - The regular fries that came with the burgers and Fish n' Chips were very oily and soggy. They were definitely just reheated and not freshly cooked.- The burger patty was nice and juicy. The burger buns though, were stale (dry and crumby).- The separate order of Parmesan fries were also very oily and soggy. We thought that they would at least cook a new batch for this order, but no, it's the same old very oily and soggy fries made more oily by the drizzle of truffle oil. - The Chocolate milkshake was okay. Most reviews for this restaurant were good so I'm surprised that our meal was a disappointment
4
I was looking for a place which was still open at 930pm. Most eateries in Singapore would taken the last order. I chanced upon this outlet at Far East Plaza.. The order was done through an Ipad. Order was easy, fast. The food was done fresh. I ordered the TBB burger, which contained bacon and cheese , I did not go for the fries which most people ordered with their burgers. Instead, I went for the mini drumlets. The burger was juicy, of the right size. For a lady, it was enough. Plus the drumlets, I was full ! good thing was, I had chosen evian water instead of softdrinks. It was not the cheapest burger around but with this quality, it was comparable with other freshly cooked burger joint
3
This is the place to go. Cheap and solid burgers that will hit the spot. Tried a few combos and have customized my burger as well as ordered one that was already feautured. All in all I have been quite pleased. These burgers won't rock your world but they will certainly leave your belly happy.One thing I do not recommend are their spicy wings. It was bland, barely a kick and moreover tasted as if it had been microwaved. The lady on the counter swore by it so I followed her lead. It wasn't until my first bite that I realized she may have just wanted to get rid of them. Should have gone for the fries instead
5
Tried this burger joint because of Food Wars Asia. Proved to be a great joint! Order their Fat Basterd for the ultimate burger experience. Their Chicken Caesar Salad is good, as well.
4
Delicious burgers and can be custom made.Love their fries as well. Best part is you can customize it end to end. It is slightly expensive, but are filling and yum! Try wasabi mayonnaise, is quite tasty. Offers good mushroom burgers for vegetarians
4
Love the burgers the taste was amazing and the price it's OK (well a little bit expensive but it's Singapore ). The service was kinda slow and NO WIFI wich was a really disappointing
5
tried a few of the burgers over the week
great side orders also not cheap but well worth the time and the money
especially compared to the alternatives Mc Ds etc
5
A really unbelievable burgers. Nice place, the owner is very gentle e friendly. I really recommend this burger shop. One of the best in the world.
5
I do remember giving another burger place 5 stars but this place IS the new king of all burger places. From a great selection to customisable, make your own burger. You can't really ask for more.
4
Very very good choice of burgers to choose from at Fat Boys..now available at McDonald House, next to Plaza Singapura and Dhoby Gaunt MRT station (across the road)...Always a good option for those who are disgusted with the sort of 'burgers' McDonalds comes out with these day's...Beers and soft drinks are also available as an option...Pasta's are now being served as well for those not wanting to much on a juicy burger..
3
We are from the USA, so a bit picky maybe. In Singapore, the burgers are more like a meatloaf. They are mixed with flour or some other filler which makes them taste kind of strange to the western pallet. The atmosphere was fine, but at $12-14 for a burger and fries, I expected something miraculous. The wide choices of toppings is fun, so perhaps that's the real value added. Like a Subway for burgers! Beers were about $12/pint and Cola was $3.50 each, so be prepared to drop some serious $ for a Western dietary staple.
4
After reading trip advisor reviews I had to try it. The taxi ride is a little bit out of the city but was worth it. I had the wimpy burger with egg, bacon and BBQ sauce, the paddy was really good and the burger so fresh, also the chilli beef fries were very tasty, my friend made his own burger with toppings of your choice. They had soft rock music playing and the service was good. Free water and the alcoholic ginger beer was very good , will be back someday when next in Singapor
5
Delicious burgers, simply awesome! I visited the place thrice, and I simply loved the stuff they have there. The ambience is right, and the staff are very friendly and helpful. Be prepared to wait in a queue if you are visiting at lunch or dinner time. I am definitely there again on my next trip to Singapore
4
An ok location next to the bus stop on Orchard Road beside McDonalds House.
Good burgers - friendly staff - excellent airconditoin.
Well worth a try :-)
5
Best burgers
Very friendly manager and staff
Great concept with cheapest beer offer in Singapore
Will definitely return on our next visit
4
Best burgers I've eaten so far and they are huge, served with thick juicy fries, well worth the money! If you don't like the burgers on the menu, you can also build your own burger!
5
i really enjoy the fresh burgers and the cool atmosphere of this place. my favorite burger is the Jamaican Me Hungry. goes well with the bitter lemon soda :)
5
Getting wrong bus.... Need to walk very far away... But worth it ! I like burger here so much... Blue cheese ? Is to perfection !! Just lovely, and the price also ok for singapore standart.... Want to come back here for sure
5
Was initially sceptical about all the rave reviews because come on, how good can a burger be? But after my first bite, I understood that they truly lived up to expectations. Their patty was cooked to perfection; tender, juicy & thick. Easily one of the best burgers I've ever had!! Their fries was a little too soft for my liking though, but overall it was all delicious. Will definitely visit again! I recommend their F.B double-deck burger
5
Fatboys is probably one of the few burger joints I'd have to keep coming back to. Their burgers are absolutely superb with customisable toppings which leave you spoilt for choiceOf course if you're too stressed to choose what goes on your own burger you can always pick from their fair share of preset burgers, the Elvis, Bleu Peppercorn and Fat B-astard (or Wimpy for the less hungry). If you aren't a big burger fan, no fear! There are many other mains such as their Philly Cheesesteak Sandwich or Footlong Hot dogs which certainly hit the spot just as well.Wash it all down with their milkshakes which are again fantastically delicious.The best part of it all is that there is NO SERVICE CHARGE. One of the best restaurants around with good value
5
My first taste of what fat boys burger bar had to offer at Marina Square..and it was OUTSTANDING!They have a modern set up whereby you walk in, and choose what meat you want with your burger (chicken, beef or pork), choose the type of bun/bread, various sauces and add on's and side order's as well as drinks.Once you complete your order, you submit it and go to the counter to pay. Takes about 15 minutes for a burger to be prepared but boy, was it worth the wait.5 star burger joint! Will be back
4
One of the best serving burger outlet in Singapore i had tried thus far , now they have more there 3 outlets. Aside from having your burger customized to your taste, they have awesome side dishes too, each portion of the meal is pretty huge.I would recommend the outlet in Dhoby Ghout macdonald hse, as its easily accessible via public transport
4
They have some unique menu like u cam found black buns for your burger aside of wheat buns. Service just so-so since all of them is boys withs style. Might for ladies u can share your burger since the size is pretty big (not as mcDonald'
4
A wide variety of burgers and if that doesn't satisfy you, then create your own! Prices are slightly expensive but the burgers tasted good. Free drinking water is an added plus point!
4
Defiantly for burger lovers. The food is quite expensive, but they are defiantly worth it as the burgers are very well cooked. With the burger you get fries and any sauce you want. The waiters and waitresses are very kind and give their recommendations. I highly recommend it to people who can eat a lot as the portions are huge! Also $10 per pint of bee
5
I just love the name: Fat Boys! Order a "Fat Bast***", or make your own burger by choosing among the long list of ingredients. The meat is well cooked and ingredients are good. All my friends came out full and with a smile.A burger (with fries) costs between 16 and 25 SGD, and there is an happy hour after 10pm: 10 SGD for a pint of white beer.This is a review for the restaurant on Upp Thomson Road, but they have many locations in Singapore and Malaysia

Let's face it, sometimes you just need to break down and have a big juicy burger. After a week in Asia, this place did the trick for me. Don't expect anything fancy. This is a burger joint with bench seating. And while this was not the best burger I have ever eaten, they do have some creative options on the menu and overall I was pretty satisfied with the quality of the food and service.Will keep this place in mind next time in SG

Our family love burgers and until eating at Fat Boys didnt think we would find such a good burger in Singapore. These are the best we have found so far. The staff were really friendly and the delivery f the food and drinks was fast. The burgers were tasty and filling.'We all had different burgers and they were all really good. The disco fries were great and the gravy on them was tasty and thick. This will become a permanent family dinner out

The burger menu is great, lots of selections, decent meats, good quality buns...but way overpriced. The service is horrific...good luck keeping a cold beer in front of you. Way too noisy, turn off all of that ridiculous music or turn it way down..it is nearly impossible to carry on a conversation in this place due to the noise

Tried both the Burger Bar and the outlet at Pasir Panjang. Overall i find the experience at the Burger Bar at Far East is better. Burger Bar has more buns choice and it's more fun building it on the ipad app. Staff at both joints are friendly and again i prefer the way the patties are cooked at the Burger Bar. The one at Pasir Panjang tasted over cooked, patties are not juicy enough. Funny thing is that the full scale outlet at Pasir Panjang even ran out of coffee! Would go back but only to the Burger Bar

Place has an open airy feel with enough space between you and the next customer.Service was ok . Staff were polite and took orders dutifully.Doneness of burgers are said to be medium as a house standard. Ours came out RAW. Oil used for cooking the patty and mushrooms in the burger tasted rancid . Fries were over done as well. Milkshake was nice and thick and the beer was served in a lovely chilled mug.Overall disappointing.

This restaurant has three locations in Singapore. We live near Joo Chiat and Fat Boys on that road was was recommended to us so we decided to give it a try and weren't disappointed. The burgers we moist, juicy and flavorful. We had the Fat Basterd, Big Bello and Blue Peppercorn. The patties were thick and hand made. The restaurant was clean and comfortable. It seems to be a popular spot, lots of tables were full and we had gone early. We enjoyed our meal at Fat Boys and will go again
