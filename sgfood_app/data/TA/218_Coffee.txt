We stayed in Geylang for a week and ate here for breakfast most days. It is super convenient being located next to a bus stop so many people grab a bite to eat before heading off. Service actually comes with a smile from the lady selling fruit which is a welcome change from much of Singapore! The fruit is fresh and food hygiene is high. There are a couple of other cheap restaurants under the one roof if youâ€™re looking for extra variety
