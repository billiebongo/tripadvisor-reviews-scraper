Good value for the caveman platter given it was my son‚Äôs birthday and we were entitled 50% on the total bill.
4
The food was much better than expected. Their portions were quite big and tasty. Only gripe was that there was too much sauce in the salad.
4
Mains were of substantial portion and packed with flavours. The wait staff gave good recommendations for sides. I have been here before and both times the service had been consistently good.
4
We were the only diners on a Sun morning and had the entire restaurant to ourselves. Food was good but on the pricey side. Thanks to the Chope offer for 50%. Tot it was 50% food bill but turns out to be for mains only.
4
Went there coz we had entertainer.
Its yummy and recommended to get the best meats there especially if u have 1 for 1.
5
I had ribeye medium and it was done very nicely. My gin tonic was delicious too! Staff made it perfect by checking on us and recommended dessert and we're extra friendly!
5
The service was immaculate- staffs were enthusiastic and jovial.
Food presentation/plating was elegant and synergistic.
Food quality is above average. Must-try: Oysters for starters
Very value for money while using Amex 1-1 promo.
3
food was average - even with the amex discount its not really worth it.service was ok - nothing extrordinary appetizer: ordered the bone marrow - it is literally a piece of hollowed out bone with some sallsa inside. main course: i have never ordered a steak before and had it sliced up to serve to me? steak portion very small and thin. side dishes: each side dish i think was meant for one person as its extermely smallhowever with the amex discount and price it is the only reason why it gets a 3/5 and not a 2/5there is potential here as the location is good. they just really need to improve on the quality of food also on a side note for the hostest/waitress. please don't seat a bunch of guys/couples next to a family with babies/children - sometimes the discussion is inappro
4
We had duck foie gras, lamb rack and prawn&scallops, pandan cake and some other dishes. Pandan cake should not be missed. Everything was value-for-money with Amex. Staff was too busy and curt at times. Place was a bit too noisy and seats too hard, great for casual dining but nothing more. Overall a gd experience and will be back again
5
We discovered FYR originally through entertainer with our friends on a weekend. We were nicely surprised by the food quality and generous portion sizes. We've been twice since, the location is great and ambiance nice and casual for groups or couples. What makes me come here and write a 5 star review however, is undoubtedly the service. The team here are full of energy and smiles and really making sure you're having a good time. Coming from the industry, to see how hard they work with that much fun and positivity is really great! Great job Paula and the team, we will see you soon
4
Taste especially the short ribs was good. But portions were small esp for price. Cannot fault the staff and service. Attentive and freindly and knows venue well. Ambience is casual.
4
Excellent food; portions are somewhat small for the price. Service is excellent but they were a little understaffed.
5
One of my favourite hangout places along Boon Tat St. As always, the staff are always friendly, making my experience positive all the time.
4
fyr at telok ayer. Waitress was very friendly. food was served quite fast. atmosphere is good. good meeting place.
4
New hangout joint. Great food, great service. Get the Wagyu striploin - it is seriously so damn good.
4
The restaurant is very conveniently located within the CBD. We were warmly greeted by the staff, who then proceeded to provide us with some of their recommendations. For the starters, be sure to try the wagyu and scallops. For the main, the seafood and chorizo with rice was full of flavour, and the braised ribs were tender. For the dessert, the panna cotta and orange sponge rounded up our dinner ever so nicely. I will be back again soon
4
Dined at this restaurant with my Friend in the evening on a work day. It was Super busy by the time we were there - around 6.45pm. Thankfully we had a reservation! Also, the steak and pork we ordered were fantastic. $48 per main course for that, but we used entertainer app to get one main course complimentary, so it was Super worth it. Would come back again
5
Went there for a family gathering. We ordered the mushrooms and Brussels sprouts. Surprisingly the sprouts, is very very good. Not bitter, it‚Äôs sweet, crispy with bacon. Then again, it‚Äôs not over powered with sweetness. Right balance. The mushrooms were not bad, but can do without it. We ordered the caveman supper, shared between 7 pax and it was of a decent portion. Value for money for the food as well. Overall, will definitely recommend this place.
2
We came here for lunch, and was forced to either choose the set lunch menu, or from the super limited lunch menu (see picture below) instead of their regular a la carte menu.Service was alright, as our water was refilled quite promptly. Nevertheless, the waitress who took our orders had a very snooty attitude after I informed her that I didn‚Äôt want to take the set lunch menu.The lunch menu had no appetisers, sides, or even desserts, so we ordered only mains. We had a beef burger, and the duck confit. The food can only be described as diner style, and utterly disappointing for its price point. The burger was too soggy, and the little salad was very wilted and pathetic. The duck confit itself was alright, but it sat atop a bed of onions that was cooked in BBQ sauce, which was horrifying. In addition, the ‚Äúmashed potatoes‚Äù weren‚Äôt really mashed at all, and was more like a potato salad. Overall, I find the food here to be ridiculously overpriced given the dismal quality. Even with 50% off due to a credit card promotion, its still hardly worth my money. Would not be returning here anytime soon.
5
Had a lunch here with some friends as the festive set lunch options caught my eye. We all had decided to go for the top up options, iberico pork for me. Everyone enjoyed their choices. Service was very friendly and attentive too. All in all, very good value.
5
Service was excellent! Food was great and the ambience was enjoyable! Loved their steak and bone marrow. Will definitely be back to try more! :D
5
Great range of beers and bar food at this Telok Ayer located place. Book a table or get there early as it fills quickly, even on a Monday! Great choice of tapas like food on the menu,.
5
wonderful service and good food. They have great staffs and we had a great time there . My new favourite
5
The staff are attentive and friendly, seems to be glad to answer when i have question on the menu, etc. Good service is a bit rare in Singapore, so thumbs up for them. Food was delicious, my cocktail was good too. No complain at all.
4
The food was good! The service was good! But would really appreciate it if it could be slightly faster.
5
I went here for dinner last time and enjoyed the beef short ribs and Ibero ribs, but for lunch the food is equally impressive-- I recommend the seabass <3
3
The ambience and cocktail selection was great. However, the food was not exceptional. Good for an easy night out without fussy foodies!
3
Service was good, food was alright. Ordered a medium steak and it came rare. Sent it back and it came back medium well.
4
Food was a fusion of local and foreign tastes and was an explosion of flavors. It was both interesting and delightful. The staff were attentive and very friendly. However, was disappointed that the menu was totally different from the menu on the website- prices were much higher and we actually wanted to try the hanger steak featured on sethlui. It was a pity
1
the chope deal applied to "steak and lobster mains" was false advertising as there was no lobster available. Was disappointed to be given false info as an a lobster fan. Along with the seafood linguine, those were the only appealing dishes. The snapper recommended by the waitress was bland and dry and my guest didn't like the pork belly. So no high standard of food at a restaurant we thought would deliver
5
Good food and good service. Plus point that it was 50% discount. The atmosphere is also nice at night. We particularly enjoy the foie gras
5
Loved the yellow free-range chicken! The scallop & chorizo rice was delish! Even the salad with a light dressing was fantastic. It was a super satisfying meal.
5
Celebrated my bestie's bday here and the restaurant was kind enough to gift us a scoop of ice cream complete with candle. Friendly waitstaff (though they seemed a bit short-handed at times) but overall I would recommend.
4
The service is good as the staff will explain the menu to you and advised what is more popular. A nice place for group of friends to chill out at and food is not bad.
5
1st time at FYR! It won my friend and I over! The meats are so so good here! We had tomahawk pork and the wagyu steak! The flavourings was on point! Would come back here again üòä
5
The meat here melts in your mouth-- try the platter with lamb, beef and chicken, you wont regret it!
5
Ordered the Scallops (3-pieces), Prime Ribeye, and Bone-In Short Ribs. Food was decent, but somehow pricy for the Ribeye (S$48).
Very friend and attentive staff.
4
Amicable and relatively swift service, really good food, cozy ambience. Pleasant place to unwind after a long day at work or to meet up with friends on weekends. Food price is steep though (almost 30% more expensive compared to its previous menu), unless you have the Entertainer app
4
i thought it's gonna be too expensive without the chope 50% off deal but turns out the food was much better than expected. got the beef brisket wrap and expected it to be any normal beef brisket, but the meat was so tender and gelatinous, and all the elements of the dish, cheese, sauces etc came together to form a glorious mess
4
Very nice decor. Attentive service. Pork tomahawk was amaze balls. Ordered the ribeye as well but it was not served warm and was not seated enough. Staff offered to replaced it though, quite grateful for that but we we were aleady halfway through so we didn't exchange it. Pure blonde on tap was a big bonus too
4
FYR is busy during lunch time, so reservation is recommended. The lunch set is very affordable (3 courses for $25++) and good.
2
the only reason to stop by is that it was close to our hotel. The service was slow, the food poor - at least the beer was cold.
unfortunate introduction to Singapore and its food culture.
5
The food had always been unique and tastefully done in quality and presentation. Well done, keep it up!
5
We had more people then we reserved but the restaurant did a great job reaccomodating us. The set lunch dishes were all excellent, with only 1 set back - the beef skewers were a little dry. On the whole, our group had a great experience!
4
The service staff was very polite and friendly. We enjoyed the food. The set lunch was good value for money.
5
This is a great place to relax with friends, the bar tender mixes very tasty cocktails, I like their selection of draft beers and the menu is ideal for sharing with a good selection of small dishes and large sharing platters. If you enjoy great meat dishes with quality drinks served by very professional and friendly / welcoming staff then I definitely recommend Fyr. I really like it!
3
It's quite noisy during the lunch peak hour and the place kinda cramp. Find the marinated steak tastes too overpowering and too much veins that it stuck in my teeth, obviously not a good cut and not worth paying additional $13 to the actual set lunch priced at $25++
4
A pleasant bistro nested ind the popular restaurant and bar belt at Boon Tat. It specializes in grilled meat and seafood by wood fire. My grilled chicken was nicely done that was juicy and tender. Service was professional and friendly. The S$25 3-course set lunch is really good value and a la carte menu is also very well priced. An excellent place to chill out or casual meat.
3
I loved my first visit here (a yr ago) but am afraid certain items are no longer kept at a consistent standard. Bone marrow and foie gras are still good but the ateak was overdone. Service was impeccable though. So i will still come back to give it a second chance
4
Every time I visit the staff are always welcoming and helpful. The food is almost always on point and if anything is not to your liking they will take it back and make sure it comes back as u like it. The beers are some of the best priced in overpriced Singapore and the set lunch for $25++ I don't think u can beat anywhereWill be back for sur
5
Went here for lunch and enjoyed the great and quick service and delicious set menu. Good value for money, nice ambiance, during lunch quite a corporate setting, but still relaxed.
5
The food & service at Fyr Cycene Ond Drinc are excellent! Will definitely recommend my friends to go there.
5
Great place for a gathering.
Affordable and delicious food.
Good and friendly service.
Will return to try the platters.
5
Quiet day on new year's day! Food was nevertheless delicious. The set menu for $25 was delicious, although the mushroom starter was a little greasy, the main of tagiatelle, with grilled brisket was yummy. Even the desserts were well judged and yummy.
5
this is very good bar & restaurant serves all kind of liquors & Beers along with excellent vegetarian samosas & french fries.you can leave unfinished liquor bottle with them .they will store it under your name and you can consume next time you visit them ,good ide
4
We had a group of 9, and ordered the giant caveman signature and the seafood platter. It was plenty for all. 2 bottles of wine and total was around $50/each so pretty good value in a group. I didnt rate the seafood platter too highly, but the caveman one was very impressive. lots of roast meat and veg.Great atmosphere and good location too. Generally very good
5
The steak tasted really nice and fresh !!I will definitely visit here again :)And there is also hav an awesome dessert I've ever had. It's call** Baked Pistachio Melt & Pandan Ice Cream**.You must visit here if you are looking for a good steak restaurant Transport: Downtown Line(Telok Ayer/DT18) just 1 mins walk. The nearby also have lots of exotic restaurant . For my experience,it's not necessary to make a reservation. But they did have good business.

4
Being there 2 times for dinner, 5 times for lunch.The dinner menu is so good, they really know how to grill their meats and fish, and perfect selection of side menus.I only give it 4* because their lunch is limited to set menu and the quality of the meats is well inferior, but of course is cheaper all in menu price. Please offer a la carter for lunch as well, I'll pay for a proper steak or fish
5
I came her for restaurant week and remembered the food to be fabulous. Decided to come by again for my Dad's birthday. No regrets!Snapper was super as was the lamb :) the wagyu was a tad fatty for our liking but the sauce were all done really well.Loved the food ambience and service :
1
Went to this place on 10th Feb. A crappy place. Our colleague book the place for 30 pax and we are given a spot that is right in front of the entrance that can barely fit 15 pax! An appropriate spot for 30 pax should be catered to us!On top of that, we are told that there would be free flow of drinks and food. When we asked for the food (finger food), we were told that it will come out in intervals. What is that supposed to mean!? Indirectly telling us that the food is not free flow. For goodness sake, it is only fried springroll, samosa and sausages!Not worth it to hold an event or a gathering here. Even the servers have some attitude problem
4
I was here with colleagues and the set lunch is very worth it! Huge portions, 3 courses just for $25++!
5
Very fresh ingredients, good service and a comfortable dining experience. Go on a weekend to beat the working crowds
4
Food was good, but it was a bit too noisy due to the loud music and other big groups there. It was full so reservations are definitely encouraged.
5
Went there for lunch with colleagues. The food is great, they offered good value set lunch. friendly staffs
5
always tasty meat and desserts done right
on a pricier side especislly if you have alcohol but it is worth it
4
The lychee martini is outstanding, and the Peroni was served at perfect temperature!Enjoyed the appetiser of scallops.The seafood linguine is savoury and flavourful. The baked bone marrow is delightful. The only letdown is the dessert of pistachio melt (which is bland and without character).The entire meal was 105.90SGD-- not exactly cheap, but the place has vibe and the music is hip, making FYR a good venue for unwinding. IN addition, service was attentive and friendly
4
The caveman platter was marvellous. The chicken and pig trotter was cooked perfectly. Baked oysters and fried chicken wings were great too. Food was even better as compared to my previous time there. Good service too. Already my third time there and would be back again
5
I was there for lunch. It's just 5 mins walk from my office. The set lunch is $25++ which came with small plate, main and dessert, it's really worth it! I ordered salmon for small plate, duck leg for main and ice cream with pancake for dessert. All quite yummy! They have a good selection of beer, I had a pint of pure blonde. Service was really good, all friendly and smiley! I will definitely be there again
4
A very nice place, not cheap but reasonably priced.The food is good. We had the lunch menu which was still available at 3pm. Portions are not to big, heavy on the meat and salad side. Perfect for me.Decent wine and draft beer available.Five thumbs up and 4 stars because there is always room to improve
5
With colleagues we shared a Tomahawk steak - the size has to be seen to be believed. We opted not to go for the Caveman special - simply too much even for carnivores. There are plenty of options on Boon Tat street, but Fyr (Old English for Fire) combines informality with modernity - good, attentive service and a range of beers
2
Too little service staff...challenging to get their attention. Had caveman BBQ; it would be better if the meats is served hot
5
Was here with my colleagues for lunch and once again, FYR did not disappoint. Food was excellent, service was great! Double thumbs up!
5
The service here is impeccable! Everyone is happy and helpful. That's why I kept going back.
Love the free flow papadum of $5 too.
5
Food was nice and excellent service. The snapper was good, i like the pandan ice cream. However the music was abit loud, table abit cramp.
3
The beef ribs were very tender although a little under marinated. Ribeye was average BUT the salsa that came with it was the best I've ever had. Made to perfection.
The rest like the snapper main and side dishes were forgettable.
5
The restaurant had great food and service. The atmosphere was a little noisy to have small chats. Despite so, we enjoyed dinner there.
4
Dishes served were interestingly prepared. The staff was well-informed & made good recommendations.Pleasant dining experience indeed!
4
The chef has a sense of adventure, his creations are an unusual blend of fusion dishes that incorporate western ingredients with Asian sauces. Our taste buds went on fyr from the Baked Camembert with fruits in ginger honey glaze. Who would have thought that braised beef short rib pairs well with rendang sauce? Go for the cassava with butter as a side dish, we dare you.
4
Visited with two colleagues around 6pm very busy but great service.Loved the casual atmosphere and music.Excellent choice of starters .Had oysters with Arlequin Chardonnay. Went exceptionally well. I returned the following Saturday (early am ) and chose from limited menu.Very few people there but pasta dish with seafood was exremely good
5
I've been to FYR for set lunches and was impressed by the quality of the food. When I read about the Caveman Supper, I was very excited to try it.Thankfully, it did not disappoint. The Caveman Supper was spectacular! The meat was all cooked perfectly! Juicy, tender and tasty. At S$150++, I understand it is meant to feed 4 people which makes it pretty good value. I shared the platter with two somewhat small eaters and another big eater and admittedly I was not ovely full afterwards. So if a trio of hungry people go, they should not have too much of a problem devouring the plate.
4
The caveman supper platter was excellent. Serving size is good for 4-5. The mixed type of meats is variation of vegetables was great combination. Environment is simple yet cozy.
5
Ive never been disappointed with FYR Cycine. Ive been there more than 5 times and each time with a different group of friends. Guess what? They remember their customers!
5
We have been here several times. It is one of our favorite date night places. Very friendly and efficient staff. Unique food choices, which are very tasty and well presented. We certainly will be back again!
5
A lunch hideout worth experiencing. We had great food, fast and attentive service and lunch price was value for money.
5
Brought friends from the US. They were blown away by the quality as I always am. Rozy and team it's always a pleasure
4
I have been to Fyr multiple times, even brought company people for dinner.The place is extremely informal, yet stylish; the wall decorations are pretty cool, telling the story of the discovery of fire and evolution of mankind.The staff is always extremely kind and attentive, they definitely know how to advice for good food.You can get a big of everything: meat, seafood, vegetarian, though I have to admit that the meat sharing platter is awesome (featuring Iberian Secret, which is a cut of pork meat I had only when I was in Barcelona).Try the lobster or the sea bass, both great seafood options.Pity they don't have anymore the tiger prawns I tried last year, nor the lamb chops (super duper amazing).Nice selection of wines, both by the glass or bottle, but maybe a tag pricey
5
Booked through Chope as they were having a promo, free desserts!We had the ribeye which was done to perfection, juicy and well marinated. Every mouthful was pleasant. Not forgetting their signature dessert (Baked Pistachio Melt with Pandan Ice Cream) which was amazing as well.Service is top notch. Ambience is good as well. Will come back, definitely
4
Celebrated a friend's birthday lunch here. A service staff heard me wishing my friend "Happy Birthday" upon arrival and they put a candle in his dessert for him at the end of lunch! A nice little touch to the great service we had all afternoon, on top of the great value for their set lunch
4
Ate the set lunch which was great value given the food quality. 25++ for three courses. The beetroot and avocado salad was simple and well made. The pan fried salmon was also well cooked. Skipped the desert but my colleague enjoyed the sticky date pudding. Service is attentive.
3
I was quite disappointed by the overcooked food I had here. I was looking forward to the wood-flavoured meats and quaint ambience, but was met with overpacked tables and overcooked dishes. Service was good, but I doubt I'll come back unless they have a good promotion going o
4
We enjoyed the grilled beetroot and spicy prawns as starters. I had salmon and boyfriend had roasted chicken leg which portion was sufficient and both dishes are also flavourful. Service team was doing a good job despite the busy lunch crowd on a weekend.
5
Food was delicious with their signature Seabass totally on point. Impeccable service too! Really great for a hangout with friends after work.
5
Shared the following items with a buddy: mussels, onglet, lobster, pistachio melt, and grilled bananas. Overall enjoyable, and the onglet, lobster and pistachio melt were all standouts.
Service was attentive, and friendly.
Space was warm, inviting, and comfortable.
I'd go back with a date.
5
Awesome e place with very courteous staff. Food that sets the palate alive with its aromatic and delicious taste .
A definite go to for any occasion
3
The place was super packed on a Fri evening so it's good to make reservations. However, my group of 4 gals felt that the meat dishes are a tad overrated; Their lamb-beef-pork platter is so-so. But their drinks are really watered-down, even my gal friend who doesn't drink often said it
4
Happen to walk along boon tat street finding for a place to eat and drink and we found this hidden gem with nice playlist, awesome food and impeccable service. The staff were friendly and it was fun having a conversation with them. We also notice that the service staff were attentive and going around talking to the customers once in awhile which is something very rare to see in restaurant nowadays. Also, the waitress with ashy grey hair were very considerate towards us, not chasing us away despite after their operation hours. Food wise, the meat platter was awesome and value for money as recommended by the restaurant manager, definitely a good companion to go along with our red wine ! Kudos to the staff! Will definitely patronize this place and recommend to my other friends !
3
This place is packed so if you are thinking of going there, please ensure you have a reservation in advance. I genuinely don't enjoy having my dinner on high chairs but that's how most of the seating arrangement there are like unless you have a min. of at least 4 or 6pax and above. The selections on the menu is average. We had the lobster and foie gras, the mashed potatoes and cassava to share. I had a peek with the neighbouring tables and realised that whatever mains you choose, it is the same way of cooking and the same way of presenting it. The foie gras is disappointing - a bit too thick and hard, would have prefer if they had sliced it in half and have it pan fried quickly to lock in the juices. Don't like the accompanied tiny piece of toast bread and jam. I don't enjoy my salad as it was too sour for my liking. Therefore don't expect variety but just a cosy place to meet and chat with your friends. My friend commented that their food is just tasteless. Food wise is below average or average but this is just my personal opinion.
4
Very good value set lunches at $25 for 3 courses (no √† la carte at lunch). The food itself is succulent - fresh salads, well-cooked meat (be it duck, steak or pork). Attentive service. A bit of a walk from the CBD, otherwise it would be packed every day
5
FYR's food was top notch. super tasty, looks gd and extremely well plated. the service was beyond impossible. upon knowing it was our friend's birthday, they went out of their way to make it a special one for her. we enjoyed our first visit thoroughly and will definitely be back
4
Food is good, and cost performance is comparably good in Singapore, I think.Chair and table is not so comfortable, and although this restaurant is clean, but design and interior decoration is a little bit old-fashioned. Maybe this place is only for eating food and not for relax and have a good time. Better to go with friends
5
Went there for New Year's Eve dinner and it didn't disappoint. Service was really and food was just simply awesome. Highly recommend ribeye steak and pandan pistachio melt!
5
Food was amazing! Staffs were extreme friendly and accommodating. Set lunches were affordable and yummy! 9 dollars for a pint of beer? are you kidding??
Am i exaggerating? Go try it yourself and you will find out!!
Will definitely recommend to friends and family.
5
Went during lunch on a weekday and had the lunch set - food was tasty, and beer was good, at a reasonable price
5
1. Fabulously done meat flavours (lobster included)
2. Attentive yet non-intrusive customer experience
3. Space privacy - tables weren't too close to each other that I can totally hear #gos
I love e name.. ull knw e reason should u visit!
3
Place is a bit noisy although the drawings on the wall are eye catching. Should consider lowering the price though.
5
The lunch sets are very reasonably priced and service was very attentive. Love the sticky date pudding!
4
Simple hearty fare grilled well with a touch of spices (laksa leaves, sea salt etc)... loved the black truffle sauce too, and the creamy, herbed grilled lobster. Yummy!
5
It's my second time here and both times, the food and service do not disappoint. This is despite the fact that they have a very tight service crew. And they are always so friendly and professional. I again ended up giving them a big tip as they deserve it
5
My friends and I were being welcomed when we arrived and each time we needed something, the staffs were always in smiles and most willing to help. The food is great and cook to perfection or the least to our liking. I will be back for more
5
FYR Cycene Ond Drinc (pronounced as FIRE Kitchen And Drink)Ironically, I work nearby but somehow kept missing this place until one delightful Sunday. Sat down for just a glass of wine and was totally wow-ed by the superb service and care from Assistant Restaurant Manager Afiz (checking in to make sure I'm comfortable, offered water and made sure I wasn't baking at the al fresco area as it was around 33 Deg. C). Promised to return and went back twice (i.e. total 3 visits in 1 week). Consistently-high service standards across the whole service team, which is rather rare in Singapore.Finally, I had the chance to sample their food on Friday evening. It was packed to the brim and I was lucky to "time-share" a seat as the reservation is 30-minutes away. This is yet another example of thinking out-of-the-box as service crew recommended sharing this table and moving outside once we are done with dinner (instead of the easier route of just saying: Sorry no seat. Try harder next time.)We shared the baked camembert and seafood linguine. Both tasted really good and the bake camembert is a Die-Die-Must-Try!!! Cheese is baked to perfection, just a little resistant to the bite but succumb totally once you get past the thin rind. Inside, slight heat enhanced the milkiness and creaminess of the cheese. Pair that with the house-made cracker or chestnut for crunchiness, or dabble with the baked strawberries or apricot for a tangy touch. One dish that made me think if I should order 2 servings next time and just make that my meal!Seafood linguine was very nicely done and flavourful. Fresh and "crispy" prawn with good bite and sauce was not to cloyingly sour (as some commercial paste can be). Owner Rosy and Chef Michel mingled with guests throughout that night and added that personal touch that made the place more endearing than others. Definitely will return to try the mouth-watering steaks next time and make this a regular hang-out place! And, I will remember to make a reservation this time round
5
Two nights in a row here. Had the porterhouse, seafood linguine, seabass and porkchop and they were all done to perfection. Service staff were attentive and prices were reasonable. Would definitely visit FYR again in a heartbeat to try the rest of the mains!
5
This restaurant has everything u wish for. Good food, humble staff and nice ambience. They also have live music. Definitely will come back here again. Best pork chop
5
Food was great. Price reasonable. Friendly staffs and prompt services. Great place to chill with friends
4
Very good food and services.
The Oysters are very fresh. The pork and lobster are both very tasty. Escargot is only average
4
Food was great and service was excellent. Will definitely go back and recommend this place to my friends!
5
We were just walking down Boon Tat Street looking for somewhere to eat when we heard the live music coming out of the establishment. There were quite a few people inside (which told us that it should be good), and the music sounded great - so we stopped and sat down outside. That was a great decision! FYR is a fairly small establishment with a really good vibe about it and the menu is varied enough that there should be something for everyone. i settled on the baked oysters for an appetizer and they were delicious but the best was yet to come when I ordered the rib steak - it was cooked to perfection and was simply delicious.This restaurant really appealed to me - live easy listening music, chilled crowd, cold buckets of beer and faux peeling plaster walls - I will eat here again when I find my way back to Singapore
3
Came here for lunch this week with a friend and opted for the 3 course set at $25++. I had the octopus salad, the duck confit and the sticky date pudding. The octopus salad was really not that good, the duck confit was ok, but the sticky date pudding for dessert was very good. Service was efficient and friendly, reasonable atmosphere

As a solo traveller to Singapore it has been quite difficult to find a place to just 'be'! This place is amazing. Felt very welcome and the owner was out to make sure everything was ok and that I had every I needed (including a complimentary shot! Not sure that is a good idea for a Monday night). The food was absolutely delicious. The service was impeccable and live music on a Monday night - and it was bustling! I stayed way longer than I should!Excellent! Would highly recommend this to anyone. Prices on par with the rest of Singapore and the wine list was excellent.Best place I've been to in Singapore so far

We walked some streets coming from China Town and wanted to sit somewhere having a beer an a steak. The food market down the road was not exactly what we expected and we went back. Even if it is not the quietest place it was pretty good. Food is excellent and the quality matches the pricing. Staff was very friendly and we would go there again

Fyr is a paleolithic-themed bar restaurant. Starters double as good quality bar food and mains were substantial. Features large selection of meats which is great for those on a keto-diet. But baked camembert came with too much compote/too little cheese. Green peppercorn sauce was spicier than what I'm use to. The Pistachio melt with pandan ice-cream was heavenly! Overall, food was more of a hit than a miss for. Together with the convivial atmosphere and friendly crew, I had a blast

Super feel like at home kind of restaurant with good food and super good service. All servers are really friendly and with very rich products knowledge and their live band was good too. A very good place for dinner and chill in town area.

The service was impeccable and the food was abnormally astonishing! The price was reasonable for the set course for lunch.
However, should consider having brunch on weekdays too!

Amazing food, especially loved the starters and desserts. The bone marrow starter was the best dish of the night for sure.

The appetizer, main course (salmon) and dessert (pistachio cake with pandan ice-cream) was delicious! Enjoyed every bit of my 3-course lunch!

Went to this place with office colleauges for dinner. The food is really good along with the service. Staff is quite friendly and help you with ordering and selection. Service is quite fast as well for the size of crowd this place attracts. The only downside was the extra loud music ... (or maybe we were too close to the speakers) ... but had to shout out loud and still couldnt hear each other ... All in all --- a good place to visit ..

I read good reviews of this new place and brought my ex staff there last Mon for a farewell dinner. Had the oysters and foie gras for appetizers, pork chop and snapper for mains. The food was excellently cooked but the appetizers were pricey for the small portions. The place was fully packed when we arrived at 7pm. I could tolerate the noise but the table and chairs weren't practical. The table was so small that all the drinks at each table had to be placed on a small portable stand next to it. The back of the chair has this big space that it is impossible for us ladies to put our handbags behind us for fear of the bags dropping to the floor. I pointed out the impractical design to the lady manager.All in all, cramped space, good service and good but pricey food

I made a reservations for 3 through CHOPE. Me and friends has a great time with the food and ambiance. We did not indicate it was an early birthday celebration for my 2 friends but the waiter spotted the wrapped presents for my friends. Gave us a free dessert on the house. Thank you. Would visit again

First of all, I'm fine that only set lunch is served during lunch hour. But if that's the case why bother give us the full menu so we were so disappointed! Second, the baked oysters really stink. Main dish the steak is so so...Service is all right - the girl was not enthusiastic. The guys was friendly though.

The food was very good; steak was flavourful, sauces on point, tiger prawns and chicken also delicious. I love the pistachio melt dessert as well. The service staff was very attentive to our needs. He provided me with a bag hook to hang my bag by the table, advised us to keep our phones because the table was small and may knock off any of our belongings that were on the table. Even when I was taking photos of the bar, the bartender apologised for the empty-ish wall behind the bar, which I suppose was usually stocked with more bottles of liqueur. Highly recommend this place!

FYR's one of my favorite go-to places for lunch with colleagues or business associates ever since I discovered it. Still undiscovered by many of the CBD lunch-crowd or perhaps above the budget for some, they have never failed to delight with their food. With a blend of Asian spices and smokey grills, whether it is vegetables or meat, the flavors come together very well to give a distinct and unique experience. This time, the 3 of us ordered different items from the August set lunch menu comprising their signature pork collar, coq au vin, and capellini for mains, and grilled asparagus, blue mussels and oysters for appetizers. Every dish was amazing with bursts of flavors bursting onto your palate with every bite. Even the coq au vin, which I initially thought as one of the least imaginative dish on the menu, was different from other coq au vins that I've tasted. The chicken was moist and tender with a tinge of smokey grilled flavor, soaked in a dish of what I imagine was juice from the chicken mixed with alcohol and Asian spices. Roasted baby potatoes that were crunchy on the outside and tender on the inside completed the dish.

I don't remember how many times I have dined at FYR. Every time the food was delicious and the service was superb. The portion is generous and value for money. It is casual and lively but not too loud.

decor was interesting, and the food (when it finally came) was actually pretty decent. but the music was so loud I couldn't hear myself much less my table companions.

Lobster was good. I like it. But the Ribeye steak is a bit over cook. I asked for medium but it seems more than medium-well

I ate at FYR with colleagues for a casual light meal and a drink. I just ate one of the vegetarian small plates and has a drink. My food was average. I understand the seafood pasta and steaks are better. The service staff however were friendly. I think FYR is probably a better dinner venue than at lunchtime as it could be a bit hot at lunchtime as it is not fully air conditioned

My fiance brought me here for dinner to celebrate my birthday. The restaurant was packed! Though the place is not very spacious, the restaurant has very nice decor and wall paintings!Food was great! We shared scallops for starters. The scallops were topped with some caviar, and oh boy, the combi was excellent. If anything, I would wish for more caviars. For mains, I had striploin and my fiance had the deboned snapper. Both were grilled perfectly. The service was commendable. We felt very comfortable dining here. I'll definitely come back again to try the other starters and mains

The place is a little loud, the voices seems to bounce off the walls and be channelled through the restaurant. The service though, from the staff is terrific - right balance of being helpful without being intrusive! The lobster was good and the steak was really juicy and tender. Price was a little on the expensive side.

Food was a little too burnt, but the surprise birthday cake (pandan) and the chocolates more than made up for it! We thought there wouldn't be any complimentary cake provided even though we did indicate that it's a birthday celebration. But the staff told me that the bf tried to get the bill, and to delay him. A wonderful experience. The food could do with more taste, and less burnt. Love the cheap beer though.

If you love steaks, lobsters, bbq, you should definitely need to dine here. The place is awesome and near the MRT as it is very accesible. The ambience has a cool contemporary vibe. Thier staff are very nice and friendly. Superb food selections. We also love the pistachio lava cake and ice cream. We always go back here from time to time. We would definetely recommend this place

You can't fault the food or service. Both get my vote. Been frequenting it ever since it opened, hoping for FYR to be my default lunch joint, not just with my work colleagues, but with clients too. Alas, despite my pleas for the music to be turned down, it was not to be... the noise level simply killed any prospect of that ever taking off... Shame really..

First time to FYR and I must say that I love the graffiti and ambience the moment I stepped in. Service was impeccable though I feel the music in the place can be tuned down in volume a little as it can get too loud for a conversation. The grilled lobsters are excellent and good value for money but the portion may not be sufficient for the bigger eaters so I suggest - order more! Other items that are a must -order include : the meat platter, the oh- so- fresh grilled scallops as starter and the pandan souffl√É¬©! Enjoy them all
