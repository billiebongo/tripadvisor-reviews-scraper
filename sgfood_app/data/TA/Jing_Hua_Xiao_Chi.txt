Excellent dumplings. Highly recommended when looking to eat dumplings and xiao long pao. But sweet and sour soup is a disappointment.

A small menu selection, but tasty traditional dumplings. Service was good and it's close by to China town area.
4
If you love Chinese Dumpings and are in Singapore this is the place for you. You probably also need to enjoy pork as well, everything seems to have pork in it. Perfect for me)

We ordered fried and steamed dumplings, bean paste noodles, spinach and a sweet dumpling soup. We like all of them but the best is the fried dumplings, crispy on the outside and juicy inside. The aircon was cold where we sat, so the food turned cold very fast, other than that, it was all good

Awesome experience and beautiful fresh dumplings. We had a large selection along with some tea. Only question would be do you use MSG?! If so please evolve your menu to not use any MSG at all and then we can dine here all the time!! Thanks

When I entered the restaurant, most of the customers were Japanese. They sat on the entrance side. When Chinese came in, even though there are many seats left on the entrance side, the staff took them to the other side. When they know I'm not Chinese, they told me to sit at the table in front of the entrance.It is absolutely ridiculous discrimination.The taste was nothing special. I know much better place with good service and reasonable price.日本人だとエントランス側の席に案内され、中華系なら奥側に通されます。 ガイドブックに載ってるからか日本人が多く、たいした味出ないのに「美味しい」とニコニコしてますが、よくよく周りを見ると扱いがわかりますよ。個人的には味も全く美味しくなく、オススメしません

Having stayed at a really nice hotel and enjoyed some really upmarket dining, this is the only place I know I'll come back to when I'm next in Singapore. The only problem was that I ate too much and had to take a long nap afterwards. We had dumplings, stir fried and steamed, and Chinese pizza. Everything was really tasty and service was friendly, quick and efficient. Would really recommend this place to anyone who wants a quick, easy and super tasty meal!

Having been a fan since 2000, I was really excited to find out that a. it's reopened its Neil Road flagship after being closed for years, b. it's expanded to a few shops in Singapore. However, The quality of the food has dropped significantly since its heydays. Dumplings were not as flavoursome. The sweet and sour soup was pretty awful. Noodles were okay, but forgettable. It's pretty unfortunate as it was a local pioneer for this type of cuisine, but given the sheer number of better alternatives (Imperial, Din Tai Fung, etc.), it's hard to justify repeated future visits

This is a great little restaurant. The Xiao Long Bao are not as refined as DTF but are tasty and satisfyingly comforting nonetheless. The Chinese pizza - more a pie - is also unhealthily yummy. Don't forget plenty of vinegar and ginger. And don't let the Aunty with her teeth hanging out put you off

I went there for Zha Jiang Noodle but it is not good. Luckily, I found their Red Bean Pancake is really well made with authentic taste. The making of Chinese Pizza is not traditional but it is very tasty with crispy layer outside and chive fillings inside

On a recent trip to Singapore I found myself looking for somewhere to shelter from the rain and have a cup of tea. I stumbled across Jing Hua and ordered a portion of pan died dumplings and a green tea. The dumplings are made in the restaurant and are delicious. It cost just over $12, well worth it
5
It was my 2nd time trying Jing Hua Xiao Chi. My 1st time was at their Bugis outlet. We ordered 2 bowls of Zha Jiang Mian (Mince Meat Gravy Noodles) $5.50 each , 1 Meat Pancake $11 (6 slices), 1 Plate of Fried Dumplings $9 (10pcs), 1 Plate of Spinach with Oyster Sauce $8.50, 2 rounds of Steamed Pork Dumplings (7pcs of Xiao Long Baos) $8 each, 1 Plate of Deep-fried Lotus Paste Pancake $11, 1 Plate of Peanuts $2 and 4 Chinese Tea (Refillable) $1 each per pax. Total bill was about $84 after service charge & local GST. We had a hearty meal because the food served were fresh and piping hot. The Deep-fried Lotus Paste Pancake was really crispy and hot, Steamed Pork Dumplings were really soft and nice, we could taste the freshness of the dumplings & the gravy. But we still prefer Din Tai Fung's ones personally. My parents loved the Zha Jiang Mian a lot and complimented that the taste was tasty for the old folks. Overall, we enjoyed our dinner at this outlet, as much as we do at their Bugis's one too. Service staffs were polite, jovial and really nice too. The only drawback was it's really hard to find your way to the restaurant because it has been fully blocked by the construction right outside the main road. We drove 3 big rounds in the vicinity before managing to find the right place. Thanks to my sis's recommendation and we will be back again in near future

Used to come here when I was little. From one unit to two units. Dripping air cons. Old furniture. Remember getting scolded by grumpy owner when we wanted to order more dessert because it was so delicious. His reasoning? Other people are waiting outside. You should have ordered everything at one go.Heard that his son took over and rebranded it, opening in various locations.Ordered one of everything on the menu. Zha jiang mian - too little sauce, too much water at the bottom of the bowl. Sauce wasn't thick and savoury as last timeSuan la soup - pretty good, but not very flavorfulChinese pizza - wish that it didn't get soggy so fast, eat it when its piping hot to enjoy it! add ginger or eat it plain. it's greatgyoza - less crispy than last time, lesser fillings. not as flavorfulboiled dumplings - pretty goodXiao long bao - pretty good but skin felt a little thicker compared to previously>Osmanthus or rose water soup with dumplings dessert - as good as ever. Sweet and fragrant. I can order as many bowls as I want without getting an earful.Red bean pancake & lotus pancake - not overly sweet with good crisp. Thought that they had a little more fillings last time.Overall, food is still good, just not as fantastic as last time.One of the things that hasn't changed - they accept cash only stil
3
Xiao Long Baos were soggy. Zha Jiang Mian noodles were still nice and springy but the sauce was a tad tasteless. Suan La Tang still packed its punch. Jiao Zi deliciously pan fried and the best for last, the red bean pancake was a glorious blend of sweet red bean wrapped in chewy dough and a crispy shell.

came by the other day for dinner after drinking nearby. it's comfort food to settle all the liquor. i like that the menu has photos of the food and you can just select your items by ticking on the slip provided. the xiao long dumplings are really good. and they are generous enough to leave the ginger slices, vinegar and chili for you on the table. they complement the dumplings very well. the hot & sour soup was not as nice as those I have tasted. it was too watery. the chinese pancake was nice as well. good deal for 2 persons, we had 4 items and didn't pay all that much. would come again. payment is cash only - they have the sign at the door. clean environment
4
Had a great dinner here! Been a Long time and happen to walk by to try my lunch. Place have expanded since the last time am here! Xiao Long Bao still very good! Had sweet sour noodle which is pretty good! Didn't really like their rice ball with peanut!
4
They offered a small menu in which we ordered almost half the items form there. The Chinese pizza was unique, like biting into crispy pancake skin with a juicy pork filling. The Xiao Long Bao was nicely steamed, with a thicker skin than what other dim sum place has delivered. The hot and sour soup could have been spicier but given such a small bowl, it was filled with ingredients! Service was efficient. Our tea was refilled promptly and my colleagues arriving one after another was served swiftly
1
They charge for the following without asking you even want it in the first place. All of these things are always complementary. - disposable towels - peanuts - tea!?! In a Chinese restaurant? We had s.meat dumplings, all you can taste is sesame seed oil. Minced pork noodles. We're just ok. A bit flavorless
3
When we arrived at noon, the restaurant at Palais Renaissance was not crowded, we were shown to our table right awayService staff were very attentive, recommending their specials, which is dumplings.Didn't take long for thr dumplings & noodles to arrive. Food is of good portion at affordable prices. Service is good, would return again for sure
5
Very simple Chinese menu but oh the food is so good.I been here a few times and it is so satisfying. After a while, I just want to go back for more. I love the Chinese pizza. It is my favorite. It has stuffed pork mince and chives. So crisp on the outside and juicy on the inside. Their dumplings are also very tasty. Their crispy red bean pancake is lovely.If you go in a larger group you can order more items to share and taste. Definitely a regular at this Neil Road outlet.Will come back again and again. For a group of 3, we spend an average of $18 per person for lunch.

I love this place simply to have some xiao long bao and then some fried dumplings and ice cold beer.
4
After living in Beijing for four years, it was good to be able to get a number of those staple foods we were used to, all under one roof. My kids loved the noodles and the dumplings and the Chinese Pizza was an absolute hit.
3
The food tastes food but it is also not outstanding. As dessert we had the red beans pancake, which is a huge portion for two people.
4
If you're craving dumplings, this is a good place to grab some along with a couple Tiger beers. Good value, you get larger servings than a lot of yum cha places - but limited menu options (they stick to the classics). Definitely get their Xiao Long Bao, served pretty much perfectly in terms of taste and temperature

We were looking for the Qong Zhun xiaolongbao shop run by an old man, where we had last had a great meal about secen years ago. The location has been taken over by Qing Hua, so we decided to try their dishes.The jiaozi was not bad, though there was way too much chives and it was rather salty. The xiaolongbao tasted of five-spice powder and there was almost no broth, though the skin was nice and thin. You can actually see the staff making the xiaolongbao as the corner located near the drinks counter.We also had the lenggou fried pancake - this was quite nice though it had been fried just a minute too long and was very dark brown in color. But the filling was delicious, sweet and soft.Including a pot of tea and two small towelettes, the meal came up to almost $40, which we thought was high. Service was good and the elderly ladies were friendly and quick to take your order. You pay up at the cashier after eating and do note they on,y have cash terms

I read the reviews on trip advisor when I was looking for a solid Sunday Dim Sum spot and this place hit the spot. Reviews were accurate that the menu is small, but well cooked. I had the pan fried dumplings and the steamed soupy dumplings and Chinese tea. Total came to around $22 SG dollars. Place is small and not fancy, but it was clean and service was nice and fast. Definitely recommend for dim sum destination

My family of four (2 adults, 2 kids) ate a simple but satisfying dinner at the original branch at Neil Road. They have upgraded the restaurant since my last visit, it's cleaner and more spacious, though its frontage is currently blocked by the hoardings for the construction of the MRT.The menu is limited and we ordered almost one of everything on offer. The steamed dumplings (10 generous pieces per order) were my favorite, the skin was thick enough for some texture but was not overly chewy, and the filling was juicy and seasoned just right. The Xiao long bao (soup dumplings) were tasty and light, though slightly under seasoned in my opinion. My kids enjoyed the "Chinese pizza" which was a fried pastry stuffed with minced meat and seafood, and the fried dumplings (Guo tie), both were crisp on the outside and juicy on the inside. The Zha Jiang noodles were too soggy and bland for my liking, but tasted better after I added some vinegar. The dessert of fried pancake with lotus seed filling was crisp on the outside and chewy on the inside, exactly how it should be, perfect! Give the rice balls with rose water a miss, the fairly bland albeit filed rice balls were small and the rose scented water did nothing to complement or enhance the rice balls, disappointing.Service was efficient. A great place to go for no frills but tasty home cooked comfort food that fills you up.

If you wanna get steamed dumplings in a very traditional, no frills place in Singapore, this is where you should visit. The meat dumplings are very tasty, same for the vegetable dumplings. If you wanna try something different, go for the chinese pizza, which is a stuffed thin pie with minced beef, pork, a bit of shrimp and green veggies (no cheese, of course). The place could get crowded for lunchtime and it may get difficult to get a table if you go with a large party. Many staff do not speak much English.

I tried their xiaolongbao and it was good. 7 pieces and priced cheaper than dintaifung's 6pcs. The fried dumplings and a must try- chinese pizza were delicious. The vegetable was just ok, and the dry noodle (jajangmyun) was average. The house tea was perfect. I suggest to ask them to start cooking the red bean pancake if it is for dessert. It takes a while to cook this.i find amusing reviews complaining of tissues having a charge. A lot of local restaurants charge for such tissue in singapore. So what is the fuss?I also felt heavy the chest up. Its either i overate or could be an msg issue as mentioned by another review. But in our group of 4, it was only me who felt heavy

Have been eating at Jing Hua for the past 15 years. While there was a drop in standards a few years ago, quality has improved to that of the past. Dishes that I really enjoyed include the pan fried dumplings, boiled dumplings and the xiao long bao. Desserts such as the red bean pancake and glutinous rice balls are also must tries.The prices of the dishes are all very reasonable. One big plus for me is that they do not charge service charge.Seen reviews mentioning unrequested peanuts and paper towels. I believe that its a norm for chinese restaurants to provide and charge for them. In my case, I have never met much resistance when I declined the paper towels
5
Whenever I am in Singapore, i always have to stop by here and get a Chinese Pizza. Its so unique and delicious that it keeps me coming back for more. Cant find something like this anywhere else, but i wish I could.
4
I used to come here very often for the dumplings, noodles and the glutinous rice balls.The queues are long by the time you start queuing at 7pm so do be patient to wait a while. Thankfully, the restaurant was extended in size a while back and can accommodate more patrons. The queues were much worse then.We now go to the Bugis outlet more often which is more accessible by public transport
1
There are 3 of these restaurants in Singapore , we had our meal at the Chinatown Restaurant at Neil Rd, in August 2015.I was disappointed with the dumplings and the restaurants value for money.The dumplings are not only small, but overpriced when compared to other restaurants I was very annoyed at the wait staff providing unrequested "free" peanut nibbles, and paper towels and then have them included as an extra charge in the bill, even though the peanuts were not eaten, or the towels used. Carefull, these "free nibbles" are a trap for tourists. I would not recommend this restaurant

As I'm writing this, I have just recovered from a bout of MSG overdose. It numbs my cheeks and make my gastric a little queasy after a meal there, 4 hrs ago. I still feel thirsty!Tourists, old and new customers, do note that there are better places out there. The food standard has dropped considerably. I've always ordered the Sichuan veg noodle soup, steam dumplings (xiaolongbao) and fried gyoza. This visit is a let down, made worse by the ajinomoto attack. The noodles are no longer handmade, tasted kinda normal, except laden with loads of MSG. The steam dumplings skin breaks easily, taste wise, normal. I have eaten better ones, example in a stall at Alexandra village market. The pan fried gyoza is quite nice, just very oily. By the end of the meal I just want to escape, cos I can feel the numbness of my cheeks and tongue. I need a drink to flush away the effects of MSG!I have been to this place since 10 years ago, before they expanded. They earn their reputation back then, when food was yummy and affordable. Thus no one mind the long queue, flimsy stools, the fierce looking boss who always try to squeeze customers around the occupied tables. I won't be visiting this place and I urge u guys to think through before eating such.... Food.

A limited menu but what they do, they do very well (and for a low price to boot). We went a couple of times. The dumplings: amazing, both the steamed pork and the pan fried. Noodle soup - awesome as well. Zha jiang noodles - decent (not as full of flavour as the dumplings). Spinach with oyster sauce - tried it once, unfortunately very bitter
5
I live in Singapore not far from this restaurant - this little gem should not be ignored by any local or tourist. The menu is simple, only 12 selections but the quality of the dumplings is just to die for. Even the chilli paste has a nice (non-oily) taste profile. Highly recommended and only a short walk to Chinatown or Club St
4
Very basic place, limited menu, very good food. As far as service, very basic, limited English spoken, credit cards are not accepted and you pay for everything. Peanuts, wet towels, tea, water - everything. That said, as others mentioned, the final bill was not unreasonable. One very strange thing though - I asked for some napkins - turns out they do not have them! They told me I had to use a wet towel instead. Is this how they try to get you to pay for the wet towel or just a very unorthodox way to control their business expenses? So overall I would say it's worth going for the food, but the combination of nickel and diming and strange service practices left a bad taste in my mouth (no pun intended).

There are 3 outlets in Singapore, I went to the one at Chinatown at Neil Rd. The restaurant has simple furnishings. Menu is limited to their specialty only. I tried the Chinese pizza which is not bad but quite big portion with a total of 8 pieces. Crispy crust and tasty and juicy meat with seafood inside. I ordered the dry noodle with pork( I don't like it). The best is the fried dumplings, really good, crispy on the outside and juicy inside. I was hoping if the have the flower bun but they don't. We paid about $35 with drinks
4
If you enjoy pan fried gyozas or steam pork dumplings, with quality and taste as good as any you will find in a 5-star restaurant, this is the place! You can now grab a table easily as they have expanded into 2 shop lots in Tg Pagar along Neil Road.
4
This is a modest restaurant with a limited menu but serving excellent "dim sum" dishes at very affordable (for Singapore) prices. We ordered soup dumplings, pork-seafood dumplings and spinach but refused the tea and wet napkin. We paid $28 SGD for lunch for two. We got there at 11:30 and by noon it was packed
4
Located in a former shop house, the premises are decent but could be improved. The service is decent, but the best part is the good value for money. The food is nice, good portion and not too pricey.
5
we had a great time eating and receive good service in this place.
the food is yummy and we like their steam dumpling and noodle.
4
Their fried gyoza is very good! Definitely recommend fried gyoza, Osmanthus fragrans rice dumpling, red bean pancake and spicy sour soup!
5
Beautiful dumplings made traditionally. Well worth the visit for lunch. Fast and efficient service, great value. Happy cheerful staff.

I have visited this Jing Hua Restaurant ever since it was just a shophouse unit that was a hole in a wall that served authentic northern Chinese cuisine like steamed pork dumplings, fried "wor tie" or gyoza, and "zha jiang mian" (noodles with minced pork, shredded cucumber and bean paste sauce when mixed together taste oh so heavenly). The restaurant has since transformed into a two unit rather newly renovated looking Chinese styled outfit but managed to maintain the quality and standard of its food. The desserts offerings include fried Chinese pancake with red bean paste (another really yummy dish) and "tang yuan" sweet dumplings with sesame or peanut fillings in either a gingered flavored soup or a floral (milder) tasting soup. It's really one of my favorite restaurants in Singapore. Good value for money. Easily accessible. Great tasting food! Definitely worth trying!
4
I get to know this place through a food blogger website (using Fieldtrip app). We ordered the food that was highly rated by the blogger and it did not disappoint us.The food (Pan friend dumplings, S.Meat Dumplings aka Xiao Long Bao, Red Bean Pancake, Osman Flower Rice Ball) was delicious and the serving was fast too. Totally recommended and would come back if there's a chance
4
Xiao long bos served in baskets of 7. Delicious with thin bao skin (so be careful when picking them up). Let the baos cool off slightly before eating them so that the soup in the baos is not too hot, and the skin of the baos are still supple for great taste =)Red bean pancake for red bean lovers - can't go wrong unless allergic to bean products
4
Visited their newest outlet located at the basement of Palais Renaissance. I'm not a fan of zha jiang noodles (noodles with minced pork and bean sauce) but actually found theirs pretty good. The noodles weren't sticky nor soggy. What I really enjoyed though were their fried gyozas and Chinese pizza. These came piping hot with very generous fillings. Yummy! We also tried the xiao long bao (meat dumplings) but I felt they weren't exceptional
4
all the previous reports are correct this is a must go. Nothing fancy and lots of locals. This is genuine and lovely. I can tolerate the 50 cent charge for a glass of ice water and the 30 cents for a hand towel plus a dollar for a small bowl of peanuts because the whole bill is very acceptable and I loved it 111 dollars for lunch for 6. A must go
4
This is one of the few places in SG where you can find excellent Chinese food at affordable prices; located on the edge of Chinatown in Tg Pagar area. The house specialty is their steam and fried dumplings (Gyoza) although I much prefer the fried version. The dish has always been consistently good unlike the steam version (too soggy). For me, I like to have the mince meat ramen to go with the dumplings. To finish, go for the fried pancake with red bean fillings
