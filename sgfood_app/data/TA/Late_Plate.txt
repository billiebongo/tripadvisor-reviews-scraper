Enjoyed a sumptuous dinner with excellent services. Fresh seafoods and definitely fresh sashimi. Would be back soon.

Still within the lunch period , but different staffs keep asking if they can clear our table while there is still food and drinks to be finished .

lunch crowd was decent, the food spread was decent and the ice kachang section was good. I will try their dinner one day.

Was there for dinner, 80% of the dishes are not replenished (not even crackers for cheese). Skeleton staffing for a weekend dinner.

Nice food, esp the chilli crabs and roasted beef. Enjoy the durian paste too. Very good value with the Citibank promo. Good service too. Its a pity that you are changing the menu as well as promo in Apr.

Really fresh n meaty black pepper n chilli crabs in the past. Unfortunately, the crabs served during this visit is not as good as before.The BBQ prawns are also overly cooked n turned out tough and dry.On the bright side, the baked salmon, roasted beef, and rest of the food still remained yummy!Service is also prompt n friendly.Hope they can improve on the quality of the crabs as well as the cooking of the BBQ prawns

I returned for a second time because of fresh seafood and the variety of international and local dishes . The cold prawns and oysters were fresh, the chilli and pepper crabs were fleshy and tasty. A small selection of sushi and sashimi were available. There were a variety of mains to choose from too, chicken, beef, pork ribs etc. Local food such as laksa and satay were available. For desserts, I love the durian pengat! :

Plate at Carlton City has a 1 for 1 deal for Citibank credit card holders. Hence, my hubby and I just pay $48++ for the lunch. Although the buffet selection was not large, the dishes served were above average. For appetisesr, there were salmon, tuna and squid sashimi as well as fresh prawns. For main courses, I especially like the baked salmon and roasted duck.
