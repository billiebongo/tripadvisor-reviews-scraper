If you are craving for some nice hot soup and big fresh Sri Lankan crabs, this is a must visit. Be careful that you will get hooked as they are not cheap. Good service and local setting in a coffeeshop. Service was good.

They will charge you at least sgd80 for a crab which doesnt even taste good. But must try the deep-fried salted egg pork ribs

Having visited Mellben at another location 5 years ago (and loved it), I was adamant to return. Mellben Signature was closer to where I was staying so my friend brought me here. The set up was very open with large tables.The crab bee hoon was as delicious as I remembered it being and it was fabulous to see there was consistency between the venues. The broth was rich in flavour, the noodles were of a nice texture and the crab was cooked to perfection, the taste of it all was simply mouthwatering.To accompany the meal we also shared the vegetables with fried bean curd and ginkgo nuts. Extremely pleased with my meal and would happily recommend this place if you're looking for a great crab dinner in Singapore

The best claypot crab Beehoon soup with noodles in town. The soup is very tasty! We also ordered chili crab (just okay only). We tried the salted egg pork ribs, interested tasty (salty, recommended to order steamed rice to eat with the dish). Will for sure go back for another portion of claypot crab beehoon soup. The staff is friendly and efficient.

Mellben Signature is housed in a standard Singapore style food hawker centre, the atmosphere is relaxed and casual. Which makes for a nice setting to focus on the food. Overall everything we had was good and because it was a large group we had a lot. Firstly we started with pork balls that had been deep fried and then served on ice with longan fruit. It was a weird combination but surprisingly good. Next came pork ribs in a salted egg yolk sauce, these were very nice, giving the pork a crunchy texture but still having enough meaty flavour. That was followed by a spicy chicken dish, which wasn't overly spicy but it's enough to satisfy the craving of the spice lovers. We had a few vegetable dishes, my favourite being the green dragon vegetable which was cooked simply in garlic sauce and has an almost crunchy taste to go along with the fresh flavour of the leaves. The broccoli dish was pretty standard as was the large tofu dish covered in a thick sauce. Finally the meal was wrapped up with Teo crabs. One was a crab bee hoon in a milky sauce while the other was butter crab. Although most tables had ordered the crab bee hoon and some of my friends really liked the sauce, I wasn't a big fan off the sauce. It does give the noodles a nice flavour but doesn't bring out the flavour of the crab for me. The butter crab was made in a thick, rich and flavourful sauce which I much preferred as it was not only tasty but makes the crab flesh flavourful and tasty. It was also good to dip bread buns in, so it gets my vote. Overall the food was pretty good and there wasn't a dish that anyone didn't like. It wasn't the greatest dishes I've had but it was a pretty good overall and I would recommend trying any of the dishes

Actually this eatery is located in a coffee shop so the ambience is not great. It can be quite warm and uncomfortable. Still, if you come after 7pm, It is recommended to make reservations first. This is my first time at Melben so tried the clay pot crab vermicelli and salted egg pork ribs.. despite the rave reviews by many posters, I find both dishes to be so-so . The crab is fresh though but expensive. Plus veg dish and tofu and one beer and three drinks, per head is S$60; expensive by coffeeshop standard

I recently ate at the Mellben Signature with some work colleges (luckily one of which was a Singapore local as the restaurant is tucked away in a laneway behind a market and only the locals know about it). We had a banquet which included 2 types of crab (including their famous chilli crab), spicy noodles, the delicious deep-fried salted egg pork ribs and also an assortment of other dishes. Well worth the trip off the beaten track

I went to Jumbo last time I was in Singapore, but just went to Mell Bell for the first time. Mell Bell has larger crabs and price is half of the Jumbo chain.I also had the coconut crab soup, very delicious and one of my favorite now

First thing, the address here is WRONG! Got a cab to go all the way to Bestway Building and found that nothing is there now. Someone got to update the address! The crab was OK, meat was a little bit tasteless and pepper sauce a bit thick, but with good price. Love the sweet and sour pork on ice. It was so crispy
4
We had a large party, 15 of us. The service was fast and friendly. The food was really good and ordered for our party by one of the locals in our group and another who lived in Singapore for 5 years. We had a mix of chili crab, veggie dishes, and meat dishes.I'd definitely go there again when in the right part of Singapore

The best crab we have ever tasted. Good experience to eat where the locals eat with lots of atmosphere. Price for crabs is on their weight and two cost us 150 Singapore Dollars which we have been told is cheap!

They have shifted to Tanjong Pagar Plaza. The crab bee Hoon soup is delicious and the best among all we ordered. We added more soup and bee hoon.
5
They have moved from bestway to blk 7 tanjong pagar food centre. Ordered their signature claypot crab beehoon, and arguably one of the best crab dishes i have ever tasted. Crab was tender, succulent and soup broth was tasty. Ordered medium size and it could possibly feed 4-5pax depending on your appetite. Will definitely return!

many foreigners are accustomed to Jumbo Seafood being the icon of chilli crab in singapore but that is simply not true anymore. as a local who has tried chilli crab from several restaurants in singapore, i have to say that mellben is the forerunner currently with a balanced sweetness, spiciness and a gravy just thick and savoury enough to make u want to finish it all up. their crabs are also of top quality and other dishes on the menu are great as well. try their salted egg pork ribs and crab bee hoon too

I had dinner at Mellben Signature with friends. We arrived as the restaurant was about to take its last orders but we were still accommodated.The order taker was a bit stiff and I felt that she was annoyed because we arrived when they were about to close. But she took our orders anyway, just with a cold straightforward manner. Food were served quickly and in less than 15 minutes, all our orders were complete. We ordered the Mango Prawns, Cereal Prawns, Salted Egg Spareribs, Crispy Fried Baby Squid, Yang Chow Rice and Mango Shake – all of which were superb.The restaurant’s location is not too accessible to the other bars or dining spots in the area but a bit of a walk for its delicious dishes is worth it. The restaurant is not air-conditioned though they have enough electric fans to cool off the customers. It also accepts major credit cards. The best thing about Mellben is its food. Customer service from the staff may still be improved

first of all, they no longer at Bestway Building. they moved to Block 7 Tanjong Pagar Food Centre since early 2016.happened to pass by when I was with my Vietnam colleague and settled there for crabs and buns and beers.tried 2 types of crabs. Chilli Crabs and Black Pepper. I love Chilli Crabs because it's gravy goes well with the fried buns. It's fingers licking good!

You can tell a good restaurant when the bulk of the customers are local. Whilst not obviously visible from the road it is very much worthwhile to sus out this restaurant. Basic in appearance the restaurant in our opinion had some really interesting menu options and the food was beautifully presented and ultra tasty. We rate this the best food we have tasted in our two weeks in Singapore. Price wise we thought the restaurant offered excellent value for money - definitely going back again!Lots of staff, very efficient service, great food, good prices - pretty hard to beat. Yummy!!!

We came here with a reservation since we are worried that queues are gonna be long. It was a Monday nite. When we got there, the place was fairly busy but not so crowded. We ordered creamy butter crab, salted egg pork ribs and broccoli with scallop, and was suggested to get medium sizes for 4 adults and 2 kids aged 4 and 6. We also took 11 fried mantao and 3 rice.The broccoli and salted egg pork ribs came first and it was delicious. I expected bigger scallop but it was ok :pThe crab took some time, and we finished the other dishes already :( when it finally come, it was also good. The crab was meaty and nice. I would like other sauce better but the others enjoyed it. The fried mantao is also great to be dipped in the creamy sauce.The bill was sgd 181 for the above order. Some may say that it is expensive for a hawker setting but it is the similar price to the original Mellben in Ang Mo Kio, less the queue and crowd, so i think it is ok. Will definitely take my quests here again.

Firstly, they have moved. Currently, they are at Blk 7, Tanjong Pagar PlazaSecondly, this is not my 1st visit to the restaurant. Best known for their crab dishes, signature dish being claypot vermicelli crab. Enjoy meaty and sweet crab flavour infusing the soup and vermicelli. Never had any leftover whenever we ordered this dish. Other dish I recommend is the either the salted egg pork rib, or the coffee ribs. Both are delightful in their unique ways. Call in for a reservations, they are getting very popular. Pricing is mid-range to slight high as for most seafood. Dinning environment is non-airconditioned, so be prepared fro a crab-clawed affair. Otherwise, a great way to start the evening, before heading out for chillax drinks at nearby clubs and pubs

Heard so much about the restaurant. Got to try the salted egg crab and not that bad but too costly. A small crab costs $65. I feel is overprice. The fried bee hoon was very tasty. 2 of the male staff are very rude. Food nice but service is terrible. Won't return at all.

The butter crab and the crab with a yellow vermicelli sauce were extremely good. All their food was good but these two dishes stood out as better than any crab I had in Singapore

Was here to celebrate monthsary with my gf.. the food here was not bad but a bit expensive. everything is good and tasty.

This seafood restaurant was recommended to us as we were unable to book a table at the busy Jumbo branch at CQ. Its is located off the main road on the ground floor of hdb area, open air collection of large round tables, no aircon, basic, noisy & hot on a Fri night, the glossy restaurant menu doesn't quite match the location. We had the chilli crab & black pepper crab which was ok, though the chilli crab sauce seemed abit too thick as it had soon set (its not actually spicy hot for those who haven't tasted it before), the crabs were not cheap at $65/kg. We also had the prawns with mango which was abit disappointing as it was rather tasteless & the mango balls were sour. There were alot of vegetable dishes to choose from. Most dishes come in 3 portions (SML). Service was ok, though they wont replace your full plates of shells mid-way. Overall dinner was pricey considering the basic environment, am sure it will remain popular judging from the reviews from the other branch

My Singaporean friends and me tried the chilli, black pepper AND butter crab - none of us could actually decide, which one was the best, as all of them were tender, full of flavour and absolutely excellent! The next time I will visit Singapore, I will definitely stop by again

We had the chilli crab and it was beautiful as was its sauce. The crab itself, in the crab in vermicelli soup was very good, but I didn't rate the evaporated milk type tasting soup and noodles. I had razor clam which was a first , and pork ribs which were over salted.I liked the outdoor spacious relaxed feeling of the place with its big round tables which was good because it was rather expensive

Went on a sat night and was the only non-local at the restaurant. Very few people dining which made me uneasy. It is an outdoor restaurant that has no frills, hot, flies buzzing your food, etc. If anything I questioned whether I should eat there! Salted egg pork ribs were good and something to experience. Chili crab was a very messy experience and I could've used an instruction manual and a bunch more wet napkins to make myself presentable after eating. I enjoyed the crab and experience. It wasn't the best crab I have ever had but it was an experience to be remembered. It did leave me really liking chili crab and wanting to try it elsewhere. They charge for wet naps it was over $100 for ribs, crab, and a beer, so it was a bit expensive in my opinion. Staff didn't speak much English and wasn't attentive but it was fine also. They got me the crab

As you know, great seafood can be quite expensive in Singapore, if not altogether difficult to find. Last Friday, we finally got to try Mellben, which we have heard so much about, and I'm pleased to share that the raves are truly well-deserved! As we didn't want to miss out on the bestsellers, we opted for the salted egg pork ribs and creamy butter crabs and honestly, my jaw nearly dropped to the floor with my very first bite of each specialty. Yes, it was that good! The pork ribs especially was a delectable mix of salty and crunchy goodness that it was rather difficult to stop with two or three. The crab, in contrast, was smooth and creamy it had enough meat in it for two people. The restaurant has big round tables ideal for big groups and on Fridays, people usually come in droves. They do have a lot of other dishes but we wanted to try the ones people who have been to Mellben swear by. I am definitely coming back to try the rest, especially the claypot beehon crab. Price-wise, Mellben is definitely not for cheap eats but I thought it was a little cheaper than Jumbo. Highly recommended

Excellent food. I tried the salted egg pork ribs (favourite dish so far). Best place for great crab. Loved the pepper crab. Even the tofu n veggies are absolutely amazing. Do try the scallop with yam. No need to dress up. It's very casual. It gets busy better call book a table. Highly recommended

Come here for weekend dinner.Claypot Crab Bee Hoon crab is a must try menu. The crab was so juice and bee hoon taste quite unique. Other than this nice crab we also order fish maw soup in clear soup which is not really nice and will not order again for nest visit, cereal prawn that is crispy and quite nice, fried hand made doufu that more like fish cake, fried mantou that not bad.Service so so but place not really clean fly and bug flying aroun

We have been living in Singapore for 7 years and have been patrons of the no signboard and jumbo seafood place. But local friends and Singapore have said that Mellben is the best so we had to try it out. Price wise it is little less expensive than the other usual suspects. Tried the chili crab and it was great. Must try menu is the century egg pork rib. Great with beer. Will definitely be back to this place when we have visitors in town. Service wise is normal. It does not mean that jumbo and no signboard are bad, all of them are great in their own ways.
