Restaurant was small and cosy, nice and clean interior. Service however, was very slow. Food took almost 50 mins to arrive after we placed our order (yes, even the salads). We arrived at 7.30pm and the meat grilling only started at 8.45pm. Service staff was very unfamiliar with the menu items. They did not know what the salad comprise of/is at all, same goes for the drinks. Wagyu was excellent - soft and tender, albeit the high price tag. However, will be unlikely to return, the slow service irks me as they only had another table of 3 in the restaurant at the time my family was there.

If you're looking nice slices of beef from different cuts and grilled to perfection on a crystal plate in front of you by the courteous team and paired well with specially selected condiments, this is definitely the place for you and your love one. You'll never regret the experience and food here.

Love the food here, but the wait is WAY TOO LONG. We waited over an hour just to be served some raw wagyu cuts, which they then proceeded to grill at our table. Why does it take one hour to bring out cuts of raw meat? The restaurant was only 30% full when we went - can't imagine how long the wait would be should they be at full capacity. They've also recently changed their menu and raised the prices. The food was good but the entire experience was ruined by the ridiculous wait time. Will not be back - what a pity.

Niku Katsumata does not disappoint. The chefs are friendly and polite. The food is served with ample time between each course. The wagyu is amazing even though it's grade A4. This is one of the best restaurants I have ever been to. Will highly recommend to everyone

 As loyal Japanese food lover, I visit Japan for more than 3 times per year. I was very excited to learn about this restaurant that offers authentic wagyu. However, I was so disappointed as the wagyu is definitely not real wagyu. The taste are not bad. But I won't go again

I have been here 3 times by now, and admittedly have always only tried their more economical options of donburi and the beef set. The full tasting menus are a little pricier, and in my experience, is unlikely to satisfy my stomach anyway.Anyway, about this restaurant. Great place, lovely ambience, though there is rather limited seating, as is always the case with these "exclusive", specialised Jap restaurants. Having been here thrice and been seated at different tables every time, I would therefore first provide this word of advice: if possible, avoid seating at the first 3 tables from the entrance. Or at the very least, the 1st two tables. My friends and I found it rather difficult to get their attention and service when we were seated there, because the bulk of the action is farther into the restaurant. Try to get a seat at the counter, where you can even view how the chefs prepare your food.That said though, service is friendly and fairly attentive. Food is always amazing. I never get tired for their A4 wagyu beef, and their donburis are the best. I definitely recommend it. Do be careful about choosing their uni for your topping though. In my 3 times there, I find the quality of the uni inconsistent. Sometimes it's that gorgeous bright yellow colour and very delicious, and one time I had uni which looked like a poorer quality; dull orange in colour and had an awful fishy stench to it.Serving-wise was okay. If you order just the donburi, it may not really be enough to satisfy you. I am a carb-loving girl with a larger-than-expected appetite. And I find just the donburi not quite sufficient. Maybe at least throw in an appetiser of the beef trio (also highly recommended - delicious!), and it's slightly more fulfilling. For guys though, I would expect it's most certainly not enough.The beef set platter was great too. Very nice appetisers, 6 juicy cuts of beef from different parts of the cow, and finished off with a tasty minced beef curry rice. But again, I was not really satisfied with the serving. A bare 3 hours later and my stomach was growling again. Better to order some side dishes, or even another donburi for a full stomach.All in all though, I wouldn't hesitate to return to this place

Had a great dinner at Niku Katsumata where the service and food were excellent. Recommended to all beef lovers as it is really value for money

Nice food. Excellent service. Superb quality of food. Will visit again if they have new promotion....

The dishes are simple, and well executed. It allows the main ingredient to shine through. Great personalities behind the counter. Will be back again!

Greeted with a super warm welcome from the crew, followed by prompt and friendly service. The food was thoughtfully prepared from start to end. Ordered the A4 Wagyu Donburi with Unami, awed by the flavours and tenderness of the beef.

Ordered the A4 wagyu beef don with foie gras, uni, caviar and ikura. Great value and loved that they didn't scrimp on the toppings either, despite the price! Generous amounts of caviar, ikura and uni, all were fresh and good quality. Wagyu was fantastic and perfectly done as well. Such a find! Went on a Saturday night and there was only one other table occupied...what a pity. This place well deserves more support
5
Impaccable service and cosy interiors! The food is really good and well worth the price. Had the beef bowl with foi gras and well worth the $25, it even came with additional compliments to add to the dish, such as rice pops, seaweed, wasabi and a dashi stock to pour over the rice! Definitely will come back again.

Had dinner with wife and toddler daughter on a Friday night. Restaurant was nicely packed, most tables reserved. Menu was very promising. We had the a la carte rather than then fixed courses, but given that most of the meat dishes were small plates, we managed to try a good spread. The use of a crystal cooking bbq plate was also very interesting - never seen this before. Apparently the head restaurant in Tokyo is members only.First the positives. The beef was advertised as being Wagyu from Japan and there were a lot of different cuts. The raw beef dishes were splendid - I love a week put together raw beef (e.g. yukke and three kinds of sashimi). The vegetables like the kimchi set and the chinese cabbage were very good. The wine pricing was also very reasonable and a bottle could be had very cheaply.The negatives. As we had a toddler, we asked for the bbq meat to be served first so that she could have her food. The serving staff simply couldn't or wouldn't serve it before they had brought all the vegetables and raw sashimi/yukke first. It was a significant delay to her mealtime. Then, the beef despite being advertised as being from Japan was more beefy and chewy USDA prime than melt in your mouth Japan Wagyu that we have all come to expect. Great for me as I find the full blown fatty Wagyu to be overly fat - but it was much too chewy for my toddler who had a very poor meal (compared to other bbq places we usually go to). The pricing for the bbq meat is quite steep given the small portions provided.

I'm the first time to that create Japanese restaurant with colleagues. Japanese food fresh and the focuses on beef in all variations - sushi , cooked sashimi , ....The atmospheres is modern Japanese style located in a big shopping mall.Cooking at your table on your own or a waiter is doing it for you.If you like good Japanese beef combined with for sushi that's the place to goit's a very hip place so it's very important to reserve a table ahead of tim

I ordered a Wagyu Chazuke Donburi, topped with uni, and left wowed by the experience.The first bites were of the uni, the shiso leaf under it, and slices of lightly seared wagyu beef. The uni was nice but I didn't think it worked together with the rest of the dish, so I finished it first with the leaf. I could tell that the beef was really good though; it was tender, had a nice firm bite, and was packed with a delicate beef flavour - who knew wagyu could come lean and still be so tasty?I was then instructed to add a saucer of puffed rice, wasabi, and nori to the bowl after the first few bites. The puffed rice gave crunch to the dish; the wasabi perked it up to keep the meal exciting; and the nori added umami flavours. I always love it when a dish can be transformed midway and enjoyed in a different manner.And after a couple more bites came the finishing touch that added the "Chazuke" between "Wagyu" and "Donburi" - the pouring of a pot of Chazuke soup into the remaining bowl of rice and beef. This was probably the best of the 3 ways of eating it. The rice and beef was warmed by the hot soup and given an additional layer of dashi flavour, which combined harmoniously. It felt great to leave the restaurant into the cold night, with a warm belly and the satisfaction of a good meal.That was a simple meal made exciting with the different ways of eating, and delicious with the use of fresh quality ingredients. Definitely worth it for $25++
