I am addicted to the durian with sago, my daughter loves the mango with shaved ice, and my husband prefers the simple and nice red bean dessert.

This place sells many traditional desserts, especially with the HK flavour. You can get ice shavings, hot and cold desserts as like sesame paste, peanut paste, walnut paste, sweet rice dumplings, well as 'traditional cakes or kueh'. Can be crowded at times. Reasonable prices.

We were at the outlet at Plaza Singapura.
We ordered the shaved ice durian dessert.
Ice is fine and the durian is authentic.
Best of all it is not too sweet.

JI DE CHI is a dessert chain imported from Hong Kong. During my trip , my brother highly recommended and ask me to try up their mango and durian shaved ice . Although it a bit costly (sin dollar 6.50) to our Malaysian . but it really taste good and worth to try . I do like the durian sago too . First time I'm tried it . Love it , and will come back again
