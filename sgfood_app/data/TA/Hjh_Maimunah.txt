Hjh Maimunah makes an excellent yellow chicken curry with the right amount of spice and oomph!
Tauhu telor was light and not oily but too much sauce was drizzled over it thus making it a tad overly sweet.
Will be back!

Recommend by my friend..nice and also good with their local food..the price also reasonable..hopefully can try the "lontong" next time.

Delicious food, drinks with variety. Price is affordable and we have been having breakfast there throughout our stay there. A must try is their lontong and also siput sedut.

Spoilt for choices. You queue, go down the line and pick out from the array of dishes to go with your rice. Halal delicious food and I want to say Indonesian/Malay cuisine. Ask for the sambal chili, it has a good kick!

Great Nasi Padang with a homely feel. The food items were absolutely delicious, especially rendang and curry.
I suppose the address listed in TripAdvisor is wrong. Cos the restaurant is located in Joo Chiat

It is cheap, not too far from bus station, indonesian taste, of course it is a halal food. The serving of food is like indonesain.

Tough decision for Friday lunch between 2 of the best nasi padang stall in Singapore. Warong Nasi Pariaman and Hjh Maimunah ... ü§î. Hjh M won this time. Ayam bakar (grilled chicken), fried fish with sambal, tahu goreng and soup buntut (oxtail)üòçüòçüòç

we went there and was in luck that the restaurant was open and had not so long que on the new year of 2018. True to the description by reviews, the food we had was delicious. I could not find flaws in taste. Lontong was crazy delicious, even to their sambal dish was crazy delicious. I would fly to singapore for a day trip again just for Hjh Maimunah restaurant. except for one thing..but maybe its okay.. at the cucur/fritters/cakes/ section (basically a different kiosk) the lady accidently sneeze towards the cakes. if only she had been wearing mask.. i would definitely give their local cakes a try. but all in all.. the dishes was delicious

Think of authentic local food and affordable costs- think no more. Amazing preparations. What is intetesting is that you pick up what you want and go to the cashier pay for what you have picked up. Friendly and efficient crew mskes it easy even if you are handicapped with language and communication issues. Truely value for money and a culinary delight that you must experience.

This branch in Arab Street is a favorite of mine vs the one in Joo Chiat simply because of its location and its food. I think it tastes better here and the people are nice and helpful. I bring my friends here to eat Malay food cos it's the closest to home cooking and still has old school dishes and wonderful kuih for dessert or tea time.They have quite a large seating capacity but lunch time (12-1) is usually packed with long queues.
