Very good Chinese cuisine. Chilli crab is very nice. The fried rice is frangrace too. Service staff is efficient.
4
Great place for a dim sum meal with the family! The century egg duck porridge is a must-try! It’s a little pricier than other dim sum places though.
4
Celebrated my child’s birthday at the restaurant, quality of food is good and nice atmosphere. Good customer service.
4
Always enjoy coming here for dim sum. Affordable, delicious and with good service. I will be back for more!

The food you will encounter in this particular restaurant is amazing. Very authentic and interesting choices!

Few dishes to recommend but need to order in advance1) Pan fried lobster steak with fresh fruits (the doneness of the lobster is perfect)2) Stir-fried shark's fin wrapped in paper served with shark's cartilage (one mouth of fin and one mouth of the soup = perfect combination)3) Soya Chicken (nothing to shout about)4) SautÃ©ed wild fungus with organic pea shoot (the wild fungus is a seasonal food-the shape look like a "nail", very crunchy and unique taste)5) Poached mee sua with dace slip with vegetables (dace slip is kind of fish cake made in house)6) chilled avocado wtiht black glutinous rice topped with ice-cream (nice combination)Service staff - highly recommend : Carmen (She is very helpful

Tung Lok Signature at Orchard Parade hotel serves exquisite cantonese food with a twist.Often the goto place for birthday parties, they have a good selection of items on their menu. It is always a delight for the staff to come forward and sing the birthday boy/gal a chinese song with auspicious longevity buns displayed on a big plate with poems written in calligraphy form. Orchard Parade outlet continues to maintain its high standard for food and services

The food was tasty but the after effects were bad. We got very thirsty after the meal likely coz of excessive MSG used. Both of us even developed sore throat and a bad cough on the night itself and took many days to recover. Service was also inconsistent eg. all tables were served wet paper towels and we weren't. Staff were also untrained, even if asked what was in the drink served, a staff can't answer and had to approach a senior. Overall, we won't return again because we dunno which dish we ate caused us to be sick
5
Celebrating special occasion, so we make reservation in advance and they customise the menu according to our budget and preference.1) 4 different kind of appetiser : steam mushroom bun (in a shape of button mushroom), slated egg friend prawn with lettuce, crabmeat & cheese in yam basket and lastly watermelon in Italian herbs (shape of tomato)2) superior shark fin in chicken broth 3) roasted suckling pig stuffed with glutinous rice - according to the waitress the piggy is only 26 days (the dish is so unique, the glutinous rice is delicious yet moist, the pig skin is crispy)4) avocado with vanilla ice-cream and beancurd pudding serve in coconut. (cant taste the avocado)4) braised cucumber with Xiao bai chai (the doneness and the taste of the sea cucumber is perfect

My eldest sister treated us family members to the above restaurant for dinner in early Nov when we went back to Singapore to clear our house. We have relocated to Shanghai since mid-January this year (2017) and they have modified their menu in these last few months. What is really impressive is their new dish, glutinous rice stuffed inside baby roasted pig, otherwise called xiao mi zhu in Chinese. It was my eldest sister's husband's birthday that day, and the restaurant manageress specially designed the room to give a surprise element for him. Of course, birthday bun is also without exception and their dessert written with octopus (mo yu in Chinese) ink was always the most memorable after all
5
great service as always,. a regular customer at tung lok. wide selection of dim sum and revised menu is colorful and enticing.
3
Typical chinese restaurant, food can be found in other chinese restaurants too. This place was choosen for promotional discount offered.
5
The food is very nice + the portion just right. We had a very enjoyable, wonderful dinner + time with the family.
4
Presentation of food was good but price is on the high side. Food portion is for mostly for 1 serving & not for sharing.
4
Serves up truly delectable and fresh dim sum. All the dishes we had were fantastic and will be back for more!
5
One of the very rare Chinese restaurant that has a cooking station for dim sum on weekend. Items are authentic cantonese fare and prices are on the affordable side compared to other similar restaurants.Great place for a comfortable weekend dim sum for family and friends
3
Food was fine but guess not enough staffs to attend to the tables. Ordered dim sum, Peking duck, daily boiled soup and noodles. In the end, the noodles did not manage to serve after we are done. Even the daily boiled soup was served after all dishes after several reminders
5
The food is excellent, more than enough in turn of portion. The chilli crab is nicely cooked and chopped so that it easy for diner to eat easily without having to crack the shell at all. The good thing is staff is good to recommend food that is just nice for 2 person . She ask not to order too much. Glad we take her advice. Thumb u

Only recently discovered Tunglok chain of restaurants. Creative as well as classic food cooked perfectly. Tried the white pepper crab and loved it. The crab legs were meaty and had a good balance of spice and crab taste. Other dishes were equally excellent. The steamed fish, fish maw soup and noodles were great. Will be back
4
We have been back to this restaurant many times and they never disappoint us. Food is always a delight and surprise. The menu changes but the overall taste is still very good. Whenever we want good food it's always Tung Lok Classics. Most impressed was the good service provided by the staff. Will be returning again soon
4
We booked a big room with 16 people. The staff handled the dinner and guests well during the night. Was a good night .
4
Had Dim Sum with my Wife. One of my Favourite places.. Dim Sum is consistent and reasonably priced. Recommended!
2
We had to wait a long time for all our food to arrive at the table and the waiters kept delivering the wrong food to our table.
4
The food and service quality has maintained since day one for more than 20 years. Strongly recommend either for casual or formal dining.
4
repeated visit but was informed that the dining privileges with amex is no longer available. nevertheless , the dim sum items and service was still gd
2
Service is slow and sub standard for the price paid. Understand that it is busy. The coral prawn is cooked differently than tung lok vivo and rws. Food is overfried. Won't ever visit this outlet anymore
3
Service level was lacking The Filipino staff who served us lacks basic service skills. She does not listen well to our requests and not active to clarify or take initiatives to check with senior staff. Settling bill was long and chaotic. They were struggling to process my Chope Vouchers. Lastly I was disappointed such a prestigious Restaurant located in Hotel do not provide complimentary parking. Will think twice to revisit

Tung Lok Signature Orchard Parade Hotel has always been our go-to restaurant for family celebrations and gatherings because of its heart warming service (service crew always sing a birthday song when serving complimentary longevity buns) and my group of elderly will be so happy with all the well wishes. That aside, Tung Lok Orchard Parade always serves well executed and highly consistent food that keeps my family very happy. This is a place that has always try to go beyond the call of duty to impress both on the food and service department. That is the reason why it has attracted a loyal group of diners who always return for more meals, mine inclusive.Will highly recommend the Sunday dim sum which they have a dai pai dong corner.
4
Oldies dim sum is hard to come by in Singapore these days and Tung Lok Signature Orchard Parade Hotel is one of the rare finds that I can find Black Vinegar Pork trotter, Sauteed Chix feet in abalone sauce that are some of my elders favourites. Prices are decent and dim sum portion is comparatively more generous than most hotel dim sum. My family loves the nostalgic menu and for myself, the appetizers like Black Fungus amd Chilled Cherry Tomatoes are just refreshing! Unfortunately, service is clearly lacking due to understaff issue on a busy weekend. Imho, Tung Lok needs to improve its service standard in order to draw in the regular crowd
4
Dim Sum at Tung Lok is always a treat. They consistently deliver. I ordered the Prawn Dumpling, Cheong Fun and Seafood Noodle Soup and they were all fantastic. The egg custard bun was a bit disappointing as the filling had almost hardened by the time it arrived. However the friendly staff and complimentary fruit juice made up for it! On the whole still recommended
3
In general, the taste of food is good, but a bit pricey. Each person costs $100 buckets. The chili crab is disappointed.
3
Ambience here is nice.
Food is above average. Try their shark fins soup.
Service is ok. Recommended to come and try.
4
enjoyed my meal at tunglok signatures, the meal was made enjoyable by their special arrangement made for birthday celebration. a great deal especially if you use the amex platinum card to dine.
4
Lamb rack and scallop Eefu noodles are the best. Avocado pudding with ice cream dessert is no.1. Can't find this anywhere else.
4
We have stayed at the Orchard Parade over the past week and very much enjoyed our breakfasts. Fresh food, well prepared and presented and always greater by our names and a smile from manager Celeste Ong. Thank you Celeste!
3
This place used to be modern and hip and then now passé. Food is ok but a it pretentious to some. Would only eat here if I am in the location.
5
Food was superb and the service was excellent. Tried out the fried tofu, siopao, siomai, and fried noodles.
4
Top 3 dishes I like the most:1) Soup - Sea whelk with sakura chicken and black garlic2) Lobster noodles (the lobster just average in-fact a bit over cook, is the homemade noodles with the thickening broth outshine the lobster) 3) Braised charcoal bamboo homemade bean curd (comes with vegetables)If you want to surprise someone, you can order "Flame Volcano Salted-baked Fortune Chicken" - it comes with chestnut and variety of mushroom (eat with white rice will be not so salty, or else inform them not to be too salty)They have pretty wide range of dessert and also dessert of the dayHot dessert can go for Almond cream with HashimaDurian fan can try the chilled durian with black glutinous with rice pureeThe ambience and service are good too

We had our team lunch here last week and did not mind if we were going back despite having several options within the hotel. I loved the crispy tofu skin spring rolls, the chicken and corn soup, the beehun and steamed fish served on a bed of steamed vegetables. There were other dishes served to us, most of them, really good cantonese cooking. Their red bean cold dessert though could use improving. Service was efficient without compromising the warmth. A good selection of moon cakes were on display up front which I took advantage of and bought a small box as a gift for my friends back home
5
While staying at the Orchard Parade Hotel, we enjoyed the restaurants buffet breakfasts. The buffet selection was substantive and all food selected was tasty and well presented. Restaurant staff were friendly, efficient and did not "hover" and instead waited discreetly to the side until someone required their attention.I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone staying at the Orchard Parade Hotel or anyone looking to eat out at a tastefully elegant restaurant with great menu options
5
Excellent food, specially the vegetarian preparation and its representation. Just beautiful. Very personalized service.
5
Best chilli crab and the dessert is reall really good.The service is faultless. t is not the cheapest but the best.
3
Good but expensive meals. The palce is not so frequented in the evening. The waitress watches your efforts with poker face.
5
We had the set with soon hock fish and roasted duck. All dishes up to mark and service is excellent. What impressed us most was the way they served the fish. They showed us the entire first before portioning it for us. They served the children first with specially cut de boned portions! Best service ever from a Chinese restaurant..
5
Stayed 2 nights at The Orchard Parade Hotel, and had breakfast in the Tunglok Signatures Restaurant, superb service and a fantastic food offer makes this THE place to come to start your day!Choices about here - they even try their take on a "Full English" that includes a Chicken Sausage! All the food is well cooked, and is on a "Buffett Style Service" Couldn't fault the food or the service.Would come back again
4
Treated my girlfriend for lunch 21/4/16 as she's a regular there they always extra nice to her.We had some tim sum, old cucmber soup which was very well boiled, pan fried tau who, tong po rau which I told them was not good enough as what I tasted in the imperial group. The custard bun was also a disappointment . We also try a new dish fun cheong with some stuffing inside that was good.Other than that we were still visit this outlet as the staff Hong sing was very friendly always smiling and very accommodating.We also always get complementary dish.Total bill for two $12

This is the usual dining place of my mom for holding family gatherings, and also gatherings with friends and relatives from overseas. Though it was frequently visited place by us over the X'Mas period, on Dec 27 last year, on New Year's Eve and New Year's Day, the manageress can always come up with a variety of food ideas to amaze us and the guests. Their special dish is the pumpkin shark's fin, in which you can also eat the meat from the pumpkin inside. They also have a range of appetitizer- century egg with ginger, fried fish skin and cucumber etc. And what all our guests like is the test tube juice drink served at the end together with the dessert. Even if we don't order desserts from the menu, the manageress will always give us desserts of the day, which comes in a big plate with a poem written by the main chef to be sung by her and the other general managers, and it is written with juices from cuttlefish
5
The restaurant is located on the rooftop of OG building in Orchard. From there, you can observe a part of Singapore as well as Singapore skyline, really nice and romantic view. The food was authentic Singaporean cuisine fusion with Japanese cuisine, and it was really good. I would recommend the Chilli and Pepper Crab there. The price, in my opinion, is ok...not too expensive but not cheap either. The only drawback is its service since not so many waiters/waitresses can speak English well. Overall, Tung Lok is a great restaurant for anyone want to enjoy Singaporean cuisine (especially seafood dishes)

Located inside the Orchard Garden hotel, the food was interesting to say the least for a guy from Canada. We got there at about 7:30 pm only to be told they were out of several of the dishes that we requested. Were seated at a table for 6 although there was only two of us and the place wasn't that busy, there were far too many staff and I'm positive we didn't see the same one twice although we were fairly well looked after I would have preferred to have one person maybe two to serve us. I was a guest of my local agent and didn't see the final bill but by the look of the menu prices it is fairly expensive
5
food is just excellent on the a la carte menu - it is certainly worth a visit one of the best weddings I went to too had tunglok caterers the package they offer is value for food - you get a free cake , during one's birthday , staff sing a wonderful rap in Chinese for your birthday & give these delicious auspicious buns the menu has enough variety to keep you going back for more 
5
Me and my husband were here for dinner, we tried a new fish at this restaurant, hock soon, has quite a lot of benefits as well!! Slow roasted pork is also a must have when you are here. My personal favorites at this restaurant.. :)
5
Nice food, Friendly staff.
I went to the restaurant on my Bday, they have served such beautiful food as well as they have even song for me !
the price is a bit higher but the quality is very good.
4
I only had my breakfeast here. Nice choices of food at the buffet, asian or continental, with cereals as well.
Manager very warmful.
Come early before 7am, less people and still peaceful.
5
Excellent experience you'll give your guests with the fusion dishes and poetic surprises on plate just for the right occasion. They even have servers to recite the poetic greetings off the plate of last dish. Just let the captain know the special occasion. Last but not least, the colourful fresh fruit juice combinations served in test tubes is always a great way to round up the feast and heartwarming experience
5
The food can best be described as one of the tastiest Chinese food I have eaten in Singapore. Based on the recommendations of the lady manager we ordered a few signature dishes of the restaurant.Two dishes were outstanding (1) Braised Buddha Jumps Over The Wall served in a hot stone pot and (2) Star Garoupa prepared in 2 ways ....steam fillet with egg white and white pepper and deep fried fillet with Wasabi mayo and honey sauce.Staff provided very good service.Dining in Tung Lok can be an expensive affair depending on what food items you have selected.But if you are craving to try authentic and quality Chinese cuisine this restaurant is one you should not miss ! Reservations highly recommended during the weekends. Tung Lok has several branches in Singapor
5
Had dinner (7 of us) at their branch located in Orchard Parade Hotel 2nd floor.We had a 10-course degustation meal, pre-selected the menu items with help and advice from their manager. My favourite is their famous Peking Duck, which is served as a 3-course item:1) crispy fragrant pieces of skin served with greens and sauce in small pancakes, prepared and served at your table; 2) we chose to have the duck boneless meat pieces fried with chinese brocolli (different in form and tast from the western brocolli); and finally 3) the rest of the duck is transformed and served as a soup in individual bowls for each guest.Con: this restaurant brand is very well know for many years in Singapore, and "the locals" enjoy its various chinese cuisines prepared by chefs trained in China. Thus, often booked for wedding feasts, birthday celebrations, corporate functions, etc., hence it is better to book in advance.

As we were staying at the Orchard Parade Hotel we visited this restaurant after a tiring days exploring. The service was excellent and the food very good.We had the roasted pork belly starter. Perfectly roasted pork belly with a beautiful crackle. Next was the Wasabi Prawns, plump, juicy prawns cooked in batter with a delicate wasabi cream sauce drizzled over the top. An excellent dish.We had peking duck pancakes. They bought out the duck and skinned it, put the skin in the pancakes and took the duck back to the kitchen. This seemed odd to us. Maybe its the traditional way to do it. The duck meat made its return in the fried rice shortly after.We also had a honey roasted pork shoulder. This was delicious. Perfectly cooked and not too sweet. It was a very enjoyable meal and of great standard

i was looking forward to relish the wonderful moments on 13.9.2014. we took the exact same S$98 lobster & seafood set. it was of exceptional quality, both in terms of quality of ingredients & quality of cooking.as before & always, every dish pleases. if i have to pick my least favourite, it would be the kurobuta & it was good too.the foie gras & smoked duck wrap was good, tasty, refreshing. i thought the “pan-fried foie gras” tasted similar to the usual unglamorous poached duck liver though.the crab roe sharkskin was super & chokeful of ingredients.the steamed soon hock fillet was very well done, very sweet, tasty, smooth, with the garnishes & sauce as well. i am thinking to replicate this for my home dinners.the pan-fried spanish kurobuta was quite delicious too. if there were not other also great dishes, i would consider this pretty good.the lobster ramen was the best. this time the serving came with shelled 1/2 lobster (before it was a 1/2 lobster in shell). lobster meat was fresh, bouncy, sweet. the sauce was excellent. & i love the dessert 雪种情怀 – 1 vanilla & 1 coconut ice cream on the usual grapefruit mango puree (杨支甘露).with palate 50% discounts for 2pax, dinner was S$49pax + S$2pax for the tea. wonderful deal! see my full reviews & photos at http://chefquak.com/2014/09/14/food-that-pleases-tunglok-signature-orchard-parade-hotel-on-13sep2014

The name of this eatery has been recently changed from TL Classics to TL Signatures, and it shares exactly the same menu as the other Signatures outlets. Disappointingly, execution varies vastly, and the quality of the cooking at this outlet - while acceptable - is far inferior to the one at, say, VivoCity. All dishes come out poorer! The décor remains classic, if classic means not refreshing anything since this restaurant was opened as the first incarnation of Chinois (by Susur Lee) 15 years ago, down to the dirty carpets and furniture. In fact, the atmosphere is quite gloomy
4
This restaurant, located at the Chinese Swimming Club, has never let me down as the food served there is consistent. And it is consistently good! I have been there several times for lunch as well as dinner and the ingredients are fresh, the cooking good and the service great! If you are headed for the airport, this is one restaurant you can drop by before leaving the country
