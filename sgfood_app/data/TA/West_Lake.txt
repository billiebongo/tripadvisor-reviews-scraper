We were regular customers here in the 90's . local food, reasonable price, good food and service. Found the service after many years absence good, food not the same as we remembered.

The food is almost home cooked like.
The pork belly bun is a must order but there are many others that are worth to try i.e. Boiled Chicken and Crab vermicelli in clay pot.
Desserts were pedestrian.
Don't expect much service here.

I keep coming back to this place, again and again.
I was here first time 19 years ago...!
Very good local food. All 4 dishes we took were excellent.
Highly recommended!

Westlake has been around for more than 30 years already. They are known for their no frill Chinese food and reasonable prices. During our visit, we ordered their signature braised pork buns, pork stickers, fried chicken and stir fried vegetables. Overall, the food quality and taste was still very good

Enjoyed our meal at the restaurant.Very friendly services and food came pretty fast. The prices are inexpensive. We ordered our regular fsvourites including crispy chicken, braised pork with steam buns, chilli crab etc. The restaurant can be reached at Farrer Road MRT Station. Busy on weekends and best to have advance booking
