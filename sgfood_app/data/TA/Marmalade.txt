Avoid this restaurant as although it is in the Oasia Hotel it does not deliver anything like the service offered by the rest of the hotel. Arriving late one evening we were provided with food that made McDonalds look gourmet ! The manager and staff were only interested in prepping breakfast settings and would suggest that many of the excellent restaurants in the shopping centre are better than this overpriced and underrated restaurant

We patronize this outlet every other month , food quality and service have always been up to our expectations, the service staff are friendly and knowledgeable. Food portions are more than adequate, however since we come often the chef should consider changing the menu items more often, it could pretty repetitive after a while. Our favorites are the hamburger, seafood and crab pasta , steak sandwich , roasted chicken just to name a few . One of the better restaurants in the Novena area , always worth a visit

Had a couple of dinners there the past year and really like it. Dishes are inventive though menu is limited. The various pasta dishes are well made.Dessert portions are huge so order to share.Service is leisurely and eating area quiet so a little chat is possible without the din.Prices reasonable considering the portions.Parking is in another building so it is quite confusing getting there

Good hotel food but coms with a big price. Staff are efficient and the view of the chief cooking the food is always nice. The resteraunt has little to no atmosphere I can think of many alternative better value for money places within walking distance. I stay in the hotel regularly but have only eaten here once so it tells the story

On 20 May 2017, celebrated my dad's birthday at Marmalade Pantry @ Oasia Hotel Novena. 14 adults had 2-course set dinner ($38 ++ per person) and a child having kid's meal. Clean restaurant with an open concept kitchen.Theres 4 choices of appetizer and main course. Slow served but the food was good. For the appetizer, the crab cake and scallops were tastefully good. And the main course, I like the grilled cod, not greasy and tender, with avacado sauce.Restaurant prepared a little birthday cake for my dad. 2 hours of private time in their cosy corner. Paid $627 for the dinner. Everyone enjoyed

Food My friend had the Entertainer app and we enjoyed the 1 for 1 deal at Marmalade Pantry. I ordered a medium rare steak and it was perfectly cooked . The tender beef was oozing with flavour . Only sea salt and pepper were used . The beef steak was so flavourful that I did not even touch the pepper sauce . Even though I ordered medium rare temperature, there was no blood. I would rate the cooking as skilful. My other friends had the slow cooked roast chicken , burger , pork chop and carbonara. They were tasty but I feel that my beef steak was the best ! As for the dessert and coffee , they were average. AmbienceIt was classy enough and not too crowded. I would consider it quite Chi Chi . Service Jasmine attended to our table and she is awesome . She is warm and friendly , serving us with a cheerful smile . She is attentive and congenial . I could sense that she takes pride in her job.I would buy the Entertainer app and dine at Marmalade Pantry again !
