Every single bit from start till the end were the best. Even though we came without booking and had to patiently wait, it was so well worth. I have never felt so satisfied with the tast of all the food at one seating. Try to believe. Worth every cent...

When I walked in, I got 'new age fusion American diner style'... with neon signs, and Nirvana and Daft Punk album art on the walls. Loved the vibe.But let's not kid. The real reason I was there; I love pide, and I love tulang... and they combined both! I really wanted to tackle the Submarine myself but I took the prudent choice of sharing it. Pide was on point, tulang sauce was delish, I found myself lapping every bit of it, and the meat was crazy tender. Ah..No regrets though on sharing, as the buffalo wings was a complete, delightful, messy, finger licking delight. Completely coated in thick sauce that wasn't overly spicy just for the heck of it, it combined awesome savouryness, spiciness, and sweetness, with just the right crunch of fried chicken under.Mah bros had the burgers and they were very happy with them (I did not taste). I did taste, however, the last bit of tashooka and immediately regretted not having more of it!The staff are friendly and like family. It was a pleasure talking to Wahid and his family and team running the place!Visual delight, epicurial delight - definitely will come back

Gathered some friends and their spouses for a meal of Halal Western. Heard about their signature dish, Tulang stew, Wagyu beef and a few others.Most of us are well travelled and ex Hoteliers who know the meaning of quality food. People who are new to Western/Meditterranean food will rate their dining experience highly.We had stew, pizza, pasta and garlic bread. Overall we rated the following:-Food Quality 7/10Beverage Quality 7/10Service 6/10Ambiance 5/10Comfort 5/10Will we return? Maybe no

It was a belated birthday dinner requested by my brother in law... Crowded with ppl, taking order n serving was a lil bit slow... but quality of foods can overlook other matters.. it was awesomely good... worth every penny spent, and worth the wait... Keep up the good work guys... the owner n staff were especially polite and communicative.My advice... be patient if u dine in during peak hours...

First time at this location; been to the one quite a while back at Simpang Bedok. Food was delicious. They are famous for their Buffalo Wings and is recommended. I ordered the salmon and it was nicely presented, and of course it was delicious too. May just drop by again in the near future

I've been a fan of this restaurant for a long time. The boss of this place is really awesome and the service are all above expectations. Recommended dish is the Wagyu steak and their Buffalo wings Bomb! Prices are affordable and yes, it has good ambience and easy place to park. A MUST VISIT!Thank you Cik Wahid for giving us the best every time we go there

The owner asked us if this is our first time to the restaurant after he gave us the menu so that he can introduce the Chef recommended dish to us.I had Wagyu beef (medium rare) and buffalo wings. The buffalo wings is so creamy and not spicy yet crispy but juicy!As for the Wagyu beef, omg!!!! Its so fresh and juicy! It's damn nice that I can't help it but to message all my close friends and colleagues that the food here taste like heaven! I went back to the restaurant with my overseas friends the following week and had Wagyu beef, buffalo wings, tunglang, macro burger, garlic bread and the list went on.... Guess what the quality and the taste of the food maintain the same. And not forgetting the excellent customer service that we received. I will be going back to this restaurant next week!

The food is awesome. We ordered the buffalo wings surprisingly its not too spicy but it has this superb flavour! My hubby loved the garlic bread that it was crispy baked to perfection n it taste so goood.We ordered mushroom soup, pesto pasta and steak.... it was goood too. We usually dine outside but whenever we order our mains or sides there will always be one or two dishes that will not make it to our taste buds. Kudos to team tish tash tosh! Service was good too!

We have been eating at TTT for the past 2 years (since Katong days) and the food quality did not once disappoint us. We absolutely love the food and will definitely be back again!

Went there on eve of a public holiday. Ordered Macho Burger (must try) and Egg Mayo sandwich (room for improvement). Overall great dining experience. Food quality and serving is good for a starving person.

TTT is becoming our special place for special occasions and lazy Sundays simply because the food is amazingly good! Everything we have ordered the last 3 visits have been consistently delicious. The Bomb, The Steaks, The Pastas, The Toolangs... all goooood!

Dining at TTT felt unpretentious, like you were entering a warm home. They serve up western food fused with local flavours. We had one of their signature dishes - the toolang. Succulent lamb shanks bathed in a rich toolang sauce that could be soaked up with parmesan bread. I don't know what secret ingredients they put in the sauce but it was delicious. On top of that, we also had the smoked salmon salad which was fresh with a light, tangy Olive oil and balsamic dressing. Their steak was also well grilled and served with an awesome mushroom cream sauce. Coupled with the homely service, TTT offers a differentiated vibe compared to the rest of the cafes in the Arab Street vicinity.I'd definitely recommend this place for a cosy get-together with friends

The thing about most Halal restaurants that serve Western food in Singapore is that they have no drive to be better. This is because there's always a high demand for Halal food, and these eateries usually get away with serving mediocre stuff (soggy fries, runny coleslaw, etc). I applaud TTT for giving me hope that sincerity still exists in terms of business. There wasn't just effort put in the food, but a whole lot of passion. At a reasonable price too. The ambience was perfect. It wasn't overly fancy, and I liked that it was small and cozy. Unfortunately, a number of Halal Western eateries especially in the Arab St area have gone towards the "pretentious hipster" direction, but TTT owned its identity without having to label itself as something it's not. What deserves special mention is the service. The service was so fluid and commendable. It seems almost genetic that they were so comfortable with what they were doing because it is impossible to hone such skills. The owner popped by a couple of times to check on us and I understood almost immediately that the service at an eatery is usually a reflection of the owner. To sum up, this place is just sincere, humble and heartwarming. Definitely on the top of my list in terms of service. Kudos TTT! Well, I've definitely maxed out in this review but if you just wanted an average type review, here it is: The crispy beef burger was awesome, and so was the steak. In TTT, when you ask for medium rare, you actually get medium rare. The garlic bread was my favourite!
