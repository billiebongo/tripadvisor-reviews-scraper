I must admit it is still one of the best laksa I have tasted.l can finish two bowls easily.l suggest that you go there before lunch to avoid the long queues.

This laksa is quite simple. It is a snack as the bowl is small. Generous addition of cockles. The flavour of the soup is light but very flavoursome.
Go early or late to beat the crowds.
5
Chinese style, in a light broth, with simple thick rice noodles, fresh and plump cockles, fish cake, sprinkle of laksa leaf and a dash of chilli. All eaten with a spoon so that you can drink up the soup cooked over charcoal. One and only!
5
They serve one thing: really good laksa. It has a delicious flavour and nice cockles too. It's not a large bowl but it's only S$3. They do get busy but the wait time shouldn't be too long.

I queued for 30 minutes on a Sunday afternoon. We didn't quite enjoy it. The broth was too milky, not spicy at all. We prefer our broth stronger in flavour, less milky, more spicy. Could be just different taste preferences.
5
Smoky, rich flavor with just the right amount of heat and it has cockles! Without a doubt, the best hawker laksa I've ever had in Singapore and it's very cheap at SG$ 3. The queue does get a bit long during lunch hours (a testament to its popularity in the area) so plan accordingly

Ask any ten Singaporeans where the best laksa is and you’ll get twenty different answers, but Sungei Rd would certainly be high on everyone’s list. The broth is cooked over charcoal and that smoke flavor resonates in the bowl. To me, it puts competitors like 328 Katong to shame. Access got easier with the opening of Rochor Station on the Downtown (Blue) line, but there’s still a little walk to get there.They open at 930, so get there early or be prepared to wait, particularly on weekends

A queue in front of a Hawker stall is a good sign. A hawker stall with queuing bands in front of it must be something special. Well, it is. If you find time, do pay them a visit. And if you're hungry, order two bowls.For those who aren't so into Laksa, there are other delicacies to be had there. Just browse along the stalls and pick your favourite :

My son and I tracked down this hawker centre laksa stall on Jalan Berseh (nearest MRT Lavender) on a recommendation, and we weren't disappointed. Sure, it is a humble local street food type food court, but the laksa is great, plentiful, and includes cockles. Not too hot, and the neighbourhood is also interesting with Peranakam houses nearby, and interesting Malay and Indian quarters

I love laksa, and this one is very good. It's quite a strange dish really, mix of coconut milk, chili, some noodles, prawns.. but what really gives it the kick is the bits of laksa leaves. And, although somebody doesn't like it, I enjoy my laksa with cockles, and with a bit more chili paste. Nice!This is not Chinese food btw, it's peranakan, a mix of Malay and Chinese culture I believe, but I can't select it on tripadviso

Taste has been a little change after the original owner has pass down the business to his children. Price has been increase to SGD 3 just for a small bowl with limited ingredients..
4
Great place for laksa.The flavors are spicy and savory, and they also had plenty of seafood pieces throughout the whole bowl! They only give spoons, but luckily they cut the noodles so it wasn't too hard to eat.
4
Best time to go is probably after 9am and before lunch crowd.
Simply executed, served hot and this bowl of laksa displayed the subtleness of rempah.
Ingredients were fresh and tasty.
Worth every cent and calorie.
5
The hype for this laksa never dies. We tried the laksa for the first time and had been reminiscing. Definitely coming back again.
5
Sungei Road Laksa in Kelantan Lane is one of the best Laksa in Singapore. They have no other branch, so be aware
4
Good laksa but cockles were slightly too 'fishy'... so end up I only ate the laksa and left out the cockles. Portions are quite small so you might consider having a two bowls.
5
Went here based on a number of food blogger reviews. Short walk from Lavender MRT station on the Green line. Not too busy on a weekday at 1pm. Short wait (5 minutes). The bowl size is quite small for $3. I saw plenty of people eating two dishes. I thought it was ok for a light lunch but not if you were really hungry. The laksa itself is delicious - the cockles were succulent and the soup was flavoursome. I think I have had more flavour in other laksas, but overall this laksa was amazing when you combine the ingredients with the soup and the chili. Highly recommended. Other options in the same food court so your friends can have other dishes if they don't want laksa

Was there around 11.30 n the barrier for crowd control is already up for the lunch crowd...the serving is considered small...maybe that's why it's so demanding. The chilli paste are always slap onto the side of the bowl...in case u don't realised, they don't provide chopsticks for the meal...u savour the entire Laksa with the spoon. The broth is rich n flavorful...if you are not game enough to eat raw cockles don't ask for it but don't regret...as it compliments the entire experience. Here are some photos of my experience...hope u all share the same happy meal..

While I don't have enough experience to make a claim as bold as "the best Laksa in Singapore", this was still a very tasty laksa. Indeed it is cooked over charcoal though I'm not sure if that makes so much of a difference. I couldn't really smell it in the nearby air, and so I doubt that is makes a significant difference to the taste of the laksa. Nonetheless, it's a nice gimmick and the laksa was tasty, reasonably priced, though perhaps a little small. I wasn't initially the biggest fan of having the cockles in the laksa as they tasted too raw, and I think it's right to be concerned about raw seafood. They did kind of grow on me and this seems to be a Singaporean tradition, so in the end I enjoyed them. If only they were a bit pre-cooked or something, or the laksa was hotter so that they cooked more once placed in my bowl!Anyway the overall taste (and that of the cockles) was nicer here than 328 Katong Laksa in my opinion, and I felt this stall was a little more conveniently located. Definitely worth visiting if you're a fan of this soup like I am. When I got here in the late morning I even managed to miss the queues

I CAN'T.Just get yourself over to this nondescript non-touristic, out of the way neighborhood, line up (always a queue) with the locals for a bowl of really inexpensive (though small, so order 2 bowls if you are hungry unless you want to line up again) and tasty laksa (and "tasty" is an understatement).The only difference I can discern on laksa from here (it has cockles) and whatever combination they put in just make it addicting. And this is the only thing they sell.By the way if laksa is not your thing there are other vendors in this small hawker center that sell other stuff, but you would be amiss to not at least give this laksa a try
5
This is the best laksa I've had in Singapore. You may have to wait in line but the line moves quickly. Get two bowls - not one. They are kinda small. You will not regret it!

First time in more than 11 years I visited this place with my family. Still famous (proven by the queue) and still ordinary to my taste buds. At $3, it's reasonably acceptable.
5
It was worth the wait. We queued for nearly 2 hours during lunch time. The laksa was very delicious. Will definitely go back when I visit Singapore again.
3
$3 Traditional laksa, cooked using charcoal. Worth the try, but definitely not the best. Long queue is expected if you are visiting during lunch hour.
5
I found this laksa very delicious and traditional. It was the first time using spoon to eat laksa noodles instead of chopsticks. There were fresh blood clams which are a rare addition to the noodle elsewhere outside Singapore.
5
This was one of my favorite meals from my trip to Singapore. It was a bit of challenge to find even using Google maps, but we found it. I wanted to eat 3 bowls of SGD$3 laksa all by myself but I was trying to save space for other foods. I regret that decision. This laksa was so delicious, and we didn't have time to hunt down other laksa later on during our trip. A small bowl with just the right amount of spiciness and the broth/sauce was just the right consistency for me
5
First time had the so much delicious local food laksa. I didn't like laksa anymore before because I had something bad. But Sungei road laksa totally lets me love laksa again.The ingredients with clams at $3 per potion. If you are a big eater, it might not enough for you. No worry, there's something else for you in the food court
5
We dined here on a wet day and it still pulled a crowd of locals. $3 for a bowl of laksa is unheard of where I'm from let alone $3 for such delicious food. Wife and I had 3 bowls between us because 2 wasn't enough. I think the laksa mix had sea cockles amongst other seafood which gave the soup an irony shell taste on the palate which was very welcoming. Give this place a try if your visiting Singapore, it's only a 10 minute walk from Bugis station or an easy cab ride.

If you are looking for Singapore traditional laksa, this is the place you can try. Been following this store since young and they still use the charcoal to cook the laksa. Standard has dropped and price gone up. Can try but not the best in town. However, is still slightly better than some laksa stalls in Katong
5
We went there for lunch and had two bowls each. This is traditional laksa and comes with only a spoon, no chopsticks, ala 328 Katong. For quite some time, 328 was thought to be the best traditional laksa, but Sungei Road has surpassed them (indeed, if they ever actually trailed them). It's gotten a little more expensive since the last time we ate there, but it's worth it.For a more modern take on laksa, travel to the food market at Kovan and try the laksa at any of the three stalls there
5
Had been around since my grandma generation. Authentic tasty, not overwhelming coconut milk & fresh small cockles goes very well. Slurp up whole bowl. 😋😙
3
The laksa source was good, but hardly any ingredients in the bow. A very small portion of noddle come with couple of think slices of fish cake. It is falling behind time, and competition.
5
have not visit this place for quite a long time, so decided to drop by for lunch. the serving now is a standard $3, and the portion remains the same. that says, I need 2 bowls to satisfy my cravings!!the old school taste is still the same. the gravy is cook using charcoal flame. no fanciful ingredients, just what is needed in a good bowl of laksa!!long queue is definitely unavoidable, but worth the wait

I was expecting too high for this place after read a few blogs. The soup was quite thin not as thick as I expected. It doesn't taste strong condiments. It was quite plain. The noodle was smaller than other place I ate plus it was pulled short and serve with spoon without chopstick. The size of bowl of 3$ was smaller than my hand (I got a tiny hand already). Not enough to make me full.
4
A friend from overseas came to town and I brought her to try the famous Sungei Road laksa.There was a queue, as it was lunchtime. A bowl of laksa now starts from $3. The bowl for $3 is the same sized as the $3. This means they are no longer offering the smaller sized bowl. Taste-wise its good and my friend liked it. They are closed every Wednesday

This Laksa had been around for ages and had passed on to the next generation. I first tried this during my secondary school years, then again some 15 years back and most recent a week ago.The flavor remains as what I had tasted it in my secondary school days, rich and not overwhelming. The Laksa is served with only a spoon to eat it. The ingredients for the Laksa is very basic, prawns and cockles not fanciful but the gravy is the difference. I like it simple, that is what attracts me. This is like the local Char Keow Tiao (yellow color noodle is excluded). It is the test of skill and passion not fanciful garnishingThe
5
This Laksa is the best I've had in years. The broth has the right mixture of flavours and the noodles are cooked in the broth. The blood cockles are small parcels of potent flavour. You can actually ask for larger sizes despite what some people have suggested, however it's still not an overly filling meal. Locals treat this more as a snack, but I would just order more. This is a perfect Laksa craving extinguisher
4
Cooked over charcoal fire, this stall serves traditional laksa cooked to perfection. Available only in standard portions with limited ingredients and to be eaten with a spoon (do not bother asking for chopsticks), it is so good that you will be slurping up very bit. Order double portions if you want to have your fill and not have to join the hour-long queue all over again

After eating Laksa in Tanglin Halt . . the laksa here was not up to that standart.It was missing for me a must of tofu . . . here there was only prawns and cookles.the soup was nice, but for me not worth the track here for that. . only go if close by.This place is also poupular so expeckt to que . . a good sign

Came here with my bro as we went on a little food tour in Singapore. I was attracted here for the traditional laksa they serve. First thing that stunned me was the old man standing in front of the big bowl of laksa broth boiling non stop over a charcoal fire. Not exactly know how the charcoal fire helps with the flavor but I'm sure it helps to keep the soups boiling at a constant temperature so it's in full flavor. The portion was on the small size and many locals would take it as a snack, but besides the portion, i love the laksa they serve. The soup you can taste a lot of different herbs with lots of coconut milk in it, and on top they sprinkles a lot of laksa leaves that give the noodle its unique flavor, then in the noodle it serves with fresh cockles, the soul of a nice bowl of laksa. The serve with thick rice noodle which absorbs the soup very well. Gotta come back when I'm in town next time
