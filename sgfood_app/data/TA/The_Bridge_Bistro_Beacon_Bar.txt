The resto is undervalued, love the bridge bistro signature pizza and carbonara. Chilli crab pasta is so so, price is slightly on the high side for its location

Had Margherita pizza, Carbonara as usual. Love the Vanilla Honey, would love it if they can provide 1 free top-up for the pot of tea.

A hidden gem in the west area. Beautiful view.. The food was delish! Though prices were a little steep, I found it worth for the quality of food. The ambience was wonderful. Would be going again this week.

Tucked away in West Coast Park, we enjoyed our walk to The Bridge Bistro and Bar. Service was good but food was average. Lamb chops very basic for price. Could do with salad. Might go back for the location.

A quiet chill out place with nice scenery. However, food standard is average. Tried the recommended garlic prawn but it was almost tasteless unless u dip into the chili sauce.
5
We had the Thai salad, cod and salmon, white wine, red wine and margarita- 6 stars excellent. Compliments to the Chef and team.
Please look for Eunice - 6 Star service

Too much activities with rowdy foreign crowd. The solo performaance by a male singer was a nice touch to help with the ambience.

Excellent place to chill away from the crowd with marina view (imagine a fusion of Quayside Isle/Keppel Sentosa and Labrador Park sea view). Extensive, reasonably priced menu and decent food. Service was quite attentive. Come on Saturdays for amazing, friendly live band (Travelllers duo). Sitting outdoors might be a bit warm if thereâ€™s no breeze, more fans around would have made it more pleasant! There were also quite a few ants that crawled onto me, though not to disturbing extent.

We were there on an afternoon and was the only customer. The food wasn't tasty/good - mostly overcooked or soaking in too much flavour. We ordered pasta but it was really sour because of the overwhelming tomatoes. Perhaps the chef should watch some youtube videos to improve on his cooking skills or get some feedback from the customers.The view on the other hand looks really great! however it was really cold and wet when it rained

Was in the vicinity so we decided to pop by for happy hour & dinner.Overall food was ok, nothing great to promote. In fact our oysters were not too fresh & when we told the server, she brought our feedback to the chef and came back to tell us that the chef said "it is fresh". So we decided not to argue or persue but told her to take away our balance 4 pieces which we decided not to eat it just in case.........So no need to drive all the way there for food but if you happen to be nearby than just go check out the environment........ however do bear with the noise that's happening just next door as there's works being done now

Great ambiance and food. This is not a place to taste local Singaporean delicacies, although they have some fusion options.
3
Good view during the evening at the outdoor seating. Pizza is good but pasta is just average. Portion of pasta is inconsistent.
2
Food is just average and cocktails below average. The pier view is good but service is extremely poor.
4
Above average food and good draft beer. The location is great with plenty of running room for the baby.
5
I had the 300g steak and even though it was slightly more than medium rare, it was tasty and went well with the potatoes.
3
Nice ambience but drinks are pricey and the happy hour pour is barely one third of a glass. Service was so so.

The location is rather inconvenient for those not driving. But the restaurant is pretty well decorated and great for a relaxing weekend. We went for dinner and could get to view the sunset, albeit not a very nice view due to the oil rigs. We utilized the entertainer app and had a seabass and duck confit mains. Both dishes are good though the serving of the food took rather long and there were only 3 tables. We also had cocktails and chocolate lava cake for desserts. This place serves rly cheap drinks, from 3.50 coffee to $6 Gin and tonic. Most cocktails are below 10. Great value for those who wants to have a drink and quiet relaxing time

Went there for a meal on Friday, 6 October, and just wan to point out that the Manager (James) is extremely rude and impatient. Like honestly he needs to check himself and show more respect to not only his customers or superiors, but all the people around him in general. If the manager does not lead by example, how is this establishment supposed to change for the better? No matter how good your food or view is, if the service is bad, all of that is disregarded as none of your customers will feel good about the way they are treated or spoke to. Maybe the manager has forgotten his humble beginnings or maybe he had none to begin with, either way, please do something about it if you truly appreciate your customers

We arrived pretty early and the place filled up really quickly as soon as evening fell so booking in advance maybe helpful if you have dinner around evening time. We ordered truffle fries, the Kurobuta pork, Angus Ribeye and Bridge's Aglio Oglio Pasta. The food was good, but not certainly the best. The pasta felt slightly under-seasoned but the sauce and other dishes made up for it. The only let-down was the service, not that it was unpleasant, but due to the lack of staff, we spent quite some time waiting in between servers busily waiting other tables and were constantly ignored

Spent a lazy sunday evening at this place. Liked that it wasnt crowded even on Fathers day, and that it was raining so we could enjoy the alfresco sitting. The restaurant also featured a live performance by a local artiste who created a good ambience.We ordered the kurobuta pork which was incredibly huge but tender, and the 300gm ribeye which was cooked to a good medium the way we like it. It was a good night :
4
The food & service very good. But outside the bistro area very warm. May consider to have ceiling fan.
5
The ambience was good and the sevice was really good too. The food served was excellent and the drinks were vey good.
2
Was told, earliest reservation was 7.45 pm as restaurant was full. But when we arrived it was barely half full. I guess the kitchen capacity was full and not the seats. We had to wait more than 40 min for food. Manager was apologetic and gave us complimentary salad and drinks. Burger was excellent. Tuna tatami average. Korubuta pork also mediocre. Complimentary cake for Mother's Day and recommended Profiteroles were very poor

Chope is running a 1-for-1 Pasta deal in the month of April. That helps offset half(-ish) the price of the following dishes. Decided it was a good incentive to give this place a shot.As with all pasta dishes here, you can opt for 3 different types of pasta when you order: Spaghetti, Linguine, Penne.There was only 1 other table dining here on Sunday. Not sure why the indoor area felt stuffy (I was sweating)-- possibly because the door was left wide open? Not sure what's up with that.On to the food--Seafood Marinara ($22++)Bountiful ingredients - more so than the pasta! The mussels were really tiny, & I would've liked the pasta more al dente. But otherwise, this was quite nice. I will say there are better ones out there; but I might order this again.Signature Chilli Crab Pasta ($26++)I enjoyed this the most! Something fairly unique with local flavour - more sweet than spicy, so that's great for people like me. Loads of sauce & shredded crab meat. It was my dad's 2nd time ordering this, so clearly he enjoys it too Hawaiian Pizza ($15++)Served with rocket leaves on top, for some reason. Thin crust. This was alright, nothing very special. Doubt I'd order it again, although it is one of the cheaper items on the menu.Arriola's Burger ($23++)Poorly framed photo; doesn't showcase how JUICY the beef patty is. Really delicious & bursting with flavour. Accepts credit cards Air-conditioned seats available☀ Alfresco seats available(If there are private events going on, you'll probably have no choice but to sit outside - if this matters to you, please call them beforehand to confirm.) Accepts reservations - I used Chop

First visit and when I arrived my body started to feel relax as the sea breeze blew passed. The place was relax n chill with an romantic lovely view over the anchored yachts. I can definitely chill at this place day till night.I ordered a TRIO OF WILD MUSHROOMS SOUP, CALAMARI RINGS, THE BRIDGE’S AGLIO OLIO, SEA BASS & CHOCOLATE LAVA CAKE. The flavor of soup is great as is the texture, creamy n delicious. The starter Calamari were powdered w some spicy powder which make it surprisingly yummy. Aglio Olio is spicy but not over powering, the spices are well balance. Sea Bass dish was one of my favourite. The fish is well cooked with the skin slightly crisp n soft on the meat, add with the sauce it's just perfect. Bite after bite. End with the lovely Lava cake, just nicely done. Once the knife cut through, the chocolate just flow out. Overall experience was Great. Oh!!! When we order the dessert the kitchen was actually closed. But head Chef Reynaldo make the extra effort to make our craving come true. Thanks alot Chef and Bridge Bistro & Beacon Bar for the Awesome Evening.

The Food was delicious and price was reasonable. The Ambient is good as we had seaview accompany us together with good food and beer with breezing wind.Very relaxing after a long day of work, nice place to chill out and gathering. Staffs was friendly and serving was fast also.

Planned to go there for a friend's birthday celebration but we ended up being told that we have to wait 45mins for our foods. The staffs were not attentive enough as they were not alert about the surroundings of which customer needed help or anything. Drinks took awhile to be served. When I asked a wait staff for the birthdaycake to be serve before the birthday boy come back, she said ok but went to do her own things afterwards which makes me kinda pissed off as I need to ask another wait staff again. I will never go back again

Pizza was okay, chilli crab linguine was quite special & had a good kick.This place is somewhere off the beaten path, which is great if you don't want to go to the usual noisy & crowded shopping centre.Service was good & the waitstaff was attentive. However, there was a wedding function & a birthday party in the premises, so we had to sit outdoors. Would appreciate if all indoor seats were fully booked for a function that the restaurant would call us beforehand to let us know there are only outdoor seats available. Or perhaps this is a learning lesson to myself to always put a special note in every reservation I make that indoor seats are preferred

We went on a Fri evening. It's quite quiet and sunset was beautiful! We sat indoor as it was really hot outside even with the wind. We ordered duck confit (very dry), medium steak (overcooked), garlic prawns (very blend). Overall, a nice place to chill but not so good for food.
3
We wanted to be near the water, outside for the evening. It was a pleasant evening. The restaurant is inside the Republic of Singapore Yacht Club (there is an indoor part of the restaurant that was closed for a private party.) The menu is varied and average and reasonable. The food was tasty and ordinary. (We did love the soups the best) A good restaurant for occasional dining.
