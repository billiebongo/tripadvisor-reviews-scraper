Food is surprising nice with prices below the market rates.
However, there is no refill for the tea set including the tea.
Ambience is good too.

nice and lovely ambience tucked away from the busy roads. food wise, looks pretty but overpriced. only recommend if going for celebrations of sorts

The savoury dishes were salty.
Eclairs were OK (though not as wow as I thought they would be), and difficult to share.
Unlikely to return.

Reservation is highly recommended as the cafe is pretty small. The eclairs are pretty but the taste was average.
5
There are a wide range of eclairs to choose from and they all look very photo worthy and pretty. Have festive exclusives to choose from too.

Happened to chance upon this cafe while visiting dhoby ghaut! It is a hidden gem! Really like ambiance and decoration of the cafe and not to mention that the e'clairs are absolute delicious and instalgram worthy.
Good place to bring your dates along!

We were here just before lunch for a business meeting.The (initially) strange choice of venue was soon replaced by our pleasant surprise at the pretty (visually, that is) selection of eclairs - which were also tasty, pronounced our companions. The buttery croissant was also rather good
5
The cafe was really crowded when I came in so I had to wait a while for my orders to arrive. But the service crew was very polite and apologised for the wait, and they made sure that my table was well taken care of during my visit.The coffee was excellent and the eclairs were to die for, 10/10 would visit again! :)

Hands down the best éclairs in Singapore. Having tasted éclairs from the famed L'éclair de Genie in Paris, I was amazed to find that the eclairs at L'éclair by Sarah Michelle are of comparable quality.The choux is handmade to perfection, while the pastry cream is just nice and not overly sweetened, unlike many desserts.Couple this with their special chicken bacon pie and you have the perfect combination of sweet and savory. When I visited, the service staff were friendly and attentive, and the barrister, Zai, makes a mean latte!In an extremely saturated dessert industry, L'éclair by Sarah Michelle stands out amongst the crowd with their vibrant and delicious selection of éclairs and should be a compulsory pitstop on every traveler coming to Singapore looking for desserts

First visited l'eclair about a year back. Exquisite eclairs by both aesthetics and flavour. With every bite, the eclairs easily reveal the taste of its premium ingredients, and sensations only true to their namesakes. Whether seasonal or classic selections, every eclair and it's flavour combinations are delicately thought of and executed. Great place to savour a piece of France on this tropical island.

It was light and delicious!!!!!!!! Nice place to hang out with friends! Definitely going back again(:
5
The wide selection of artisan eclairs and homemade pies, coupled with the french-inspired decor makes L'eclair a truly worthwhile place to visit. It is by far THE place to go to get your cafe fix!

My third visit! Loved the cosy ambience. The eclairs and quiches are fantastic!! They have a wide range of eclairs, with seasonal ones during CNY and Christmas. Very pretty and instagram-worthy! Worth every penny and would definitely visit again. Good for any occasion- for parties, for the in-laws, birthdays, baby showers, etc! 5 thumbs up

was first brought to their cafe by a friend to try out their tea set. was awed by how delicate and exquisite the mini eclairs are. and they taste as good as they look. the set comes with tea, some e'clairs and savory too, there were 3 of us and the portion was more than enough. also went back a few times to get their regular-sized e'clairs as gift (love their packaging too!) and my clients loved them too. Try out their vanilla pecan e'clair, my favourite! Oh their bacon pie is delish too. can go with a group of friends, because they have many flavours and you can get to try more when you have a group

â€‹Hi, I would like to make a complain. I am heartbroken. I made my visit to try the eclairs at your shop near park mall and this is my worst regret in life. How can you make such nice eclairs that makes me want to go back every time? Now my weekends are gone! I have to eat your eclairs every week, else I would suffer from withdrawal syndrome. It is worth every penny. I was served by this eclair called Vanilla. I was utterly heartbroken, it not only melts in my mouth, but it melts my heart too. I can feel the hard work and passion put in by the patissier - Michelle (I heard she graduated from Le Cordon Bleu). Did I taste a bit of sweat and tears? Just joking. Now I have to miss it for another week. Time for my rehabilitation.P.s. do not try it if you are prone to addictio

Great cosy space to hang out, awesome space for those photos, and most importantly great tasting eclairs with obviously high quality ingredients, that justifies it price. That said, i'm a savoury person and my favourite thing there is the PIE (all are awesome). end it off with an eclaire and you had yourself a great night
5
This is the go to place when I feel like having e'clair or quality desserts. The e'clairs they have are both visually appealing and absolutely tasty. The Vanilla flavor is my absolute favorite and it is a must on every visit. What I really love about the place is that flavors are constantly changing and I can be sure to be pleasantly surprise each time. Apart from vanilla, they also have e'clairs with local flavors such as kaya that puts a local twist to a french dessert. I also love the chicken pie served there, probably as tasty as any I have tried in Singapore.A must:1. Vanilla e'clair2. Chicken pi

I will never have stepped into this cafe if not for a friend's recommendation and true enough when I tried to find my way there, I relied on my GPS.The moment you stepped into L'eclaire, you can tell that the owner, Michelle has put a lot of effort and $$$ into this establishment. I wouldn't go in detail on the layout/furnishing as that is not the main point. (Love the luxury yet comfortable area in short)As for the Eclairs, you must really try their signature flavours. I have tried their Vanilla and till date, that is still my FAVOURITE! No doubt it is pricier than the ones you get from Polar or even some random cafes, L'eclair can be said to have the best Eclair in SG. I never have expected Eclair to taste this good until you tried L'eclair'Anyway, Michelle who is the owner is very friendly. She makes it a point to come by to ask for improvements on her L'eclair and it is always nice to have the owner of an establishment to PR.No regrets paying for this sweet indulgence and I would definitely bring my clients there to try since L'eclair is so conducive for a meet up. Not noisy at all unlike other cafes

The place was lovely, the table settings and furniture were all very pretty!! Food wise, I was so satisfied with their sweet treats! The eclairs were not too sweet and there are many many flavours to choose from. Their mini eclairs are too cute!!!! Definitely a good gift too. Will be back to try their savoury pies soon

Love love love their eclairs - they are beautiful and taste great. My top 3 flavors are vanilla pecan, lemon meringue and ispahan (rose, lychee, raspberry). Every eclair looks super delicate and you can tell it's made with love! They are terribly creative as well - loved the seasonal salted egg eclair that was created for Mid Autumn Festival so much I had it twice in a month!But if your stomach only has space for one item, please try the chicken bacon pie. Comes with a side salad and filling enough for a full meal. The crust is sweet, which is unlike the normal pies you get out there. The chicken bacon filling - oh my goodness - no words can describe it you have to try it for yourself. For vegetarians, the mushroom pie is great as well

It's the haute couture eclairs! Finest puff pastries in Singapore which would definitely give French bakeries a run for their money. In particular, try the kaya, vanilla and lemon eclairs - all the friends I brought there thanked me for introducing the place to them.
5
A perfect environment for a treat ! The latte is just the right temperature and the dark chocolate n cocoa streusel eclair is simply delightful. A must visit if u love eclair, so many other choices.
Good place for afternoon tea.

If you have an appetite for all things sweet or if you are simply looking for a quiet place away from the bustle of the city, consider visiting L'eclair by Sarah Michelle. This is the place to be to take nice “Insta-worthy” pictures of your desserts and to treat yourself to sweet delicacies! I'd definitely return for their earl grey latte paired with their high tea set.

- Pretty looking Eclairs - Absolutely DELICIOUS ( especially the Tahitian Vanilla & Pecans )- A tad pricey, but you get what you pay for. It's definitely worth it!!- Place is cosy and tuck away from the noisy crowd- Pleasant staffs- Owner Chef Michelle graduate from Le Cordon Bleu Pairs. ( maybe that explains why the eclairs are so delicious

Read about this online and went down to try their Tea Set the next day (was fortunate to reserve their last tea set slot of the day).I must say they serve the best eclairs in Singapore. There’s a good variety of flavours - flavours which I wouldn’t imagine them on an eclair but they actually tasted great! My favourite flavours are Vanilla (you can actually see speckles of vanilla beans) and bailey cheesecake (must must try!). Oh! Don’t forget to order their signature bacon pie too! Its crispy crust will melt in your mouth! Highly recommended!!!! I also read that they have seasonal/local flavours during festive seasons. Will definitely go back to try those local flavours. Thumbs up!!

Went to leclair with a couple of friends when i was feeling kind of down. I've been there before and loved their kaya eclairs which unfortunately are not being sold this period.Decided to go with the classic vanilla which was an eclair blue chip by leclair and decided to try the bailey cheese cake... mind was officially blown.The baileys cheesecake is without a doubt my favourite flavor of eclair. Sorry. No. My favourite dessert of all time. Everything about this french pastry epitomises perfection.The choux au craquelin was made beautifully with the right amount of crunch resulting in the optimal texture.The baileys pastry cream added that tinge of alcohol that gave that extra kick when you bite down on the eclair.Not to mention the cheesecake cream with bailey ganache which had the right amount of sweetness without having to feel you have sinned and required repentance for the rest of the year.By combining all of these elements together, the baileys cheesecake flavour from leclair by sarah michelle created a symphony that i have never felt nor tasted before in my entire life, at that moment, i was ready to die and go to heaven.Tl;dr - baileys cheesecake is power packed. Die die must tr

Has the high tea set at $60 which is quite expensive but looking at what is offers. 5 mini eclairs and some pastries. No doubt some of pastries and eclairs is nice. Tea is normal. The normal size of eclairs is selling at $8+ and there are a lot of variety
5
[The Food]I had 3 eclairs and all of them didn't fail to impress me in terms of looks and taste. Each eclair was fully packed with their individual filling so that's definitely a plus point. They stayed true to the flavours that they were supposed to bring out and packed a punch! They were a tad sweet but easily balanced out with the tea that I ordered. I appreciated the fact that the tea wasn't hot but lukewarm so I could sip on it immediately. [Service]The staff were very friendly and knowledgeable, offering their advice on what eclairs and tea to order based on our taste preferences (sweet, etc.). [Atmosphere]A pretty small joint though it boasts a modern and whitewashed interiors. Definitely a good place to catch up with friends over high tea

First up, the eclairs are just delicious. Not only do they look good, they truly do taste as amazing as they look.I tried the lemon & earl grey. Both absolutely divine! The cafe is rather small, but the cosy atmosphere was very relaxing and the decor highly 'instagram worthy' :-)Will be back for the high tea (they serve mini sized eclairs and a selection of savoury pastries with tea)

My husband and I visited L'eclair one Friday afternoon and sampled four of their eclairs, and were wowed by all of them. They are easily the best eclairs I've eaten, and well worth the price. The pastry itself is executed perfectly, the fillings are beautifully smooth and creamy and the toppings both pretty and flavourful. The salted caramel and strawberry pistachio were both excellent, but my personal favourites were the tangy passionfruit mango and the divinely delicious vanilla (simple, but perfect). I'm already planning a return visit to try the other flavours
