Nice little place to have a break during shopping at Takashimaya.
I tried the Persian Tea and was deliciously exotic. The scones were superb!!! ...Too bad do not offer WiFi

The view was great and the service was fast. It was an enjoyable experience with me and my friends. Macaroons and their deserts are a must try!

TWG - one of the few truly global brands to originate from the tiny city state of Singapore. I was quite impressed with the overall customer service experience at the TWG branch at Takashimaya, Ngee Ann City today. In a self-indulgent mood, I had walked into TWG without any reservation, for a solo lunch. Two staff immediately worked seamlessly to usher me to a choice of two tables. As I preferred a window seat, the second waiter invited me to sit at an available table nearby before promptly moving me to a table by the window after it was speedily cleared and made ready. A third waiter was able to provide helpful recommendations after noting some of my preferences. I ended up bypassing the set meals and chose the Jade of Africa tea, mushroom soup, Norwegian salmon and dark chocolate truffle tart. What was also much appreciated was the very relaxing atmosphere with soothing strains of classical and lounge music playing in the background. It reminded me of a similarly pleasant experience at the small Fortnum & Mason branch at London’s St Pancreas Station. Visually, the tea I ordered was not as vibrantly red as I had hoped for. Of a golden orange hue, it was nonetheless pleasant. There was a large quantity of it as it came in the signature TWG teapot - a cute round and shiny stainless steel pot. The mushroom soup was as authentic as it was thick and rich with generous portions of minced mushrooms, infused with Pu-Erh Chinese tea. The herb butter was unique in that it had a hint of dukkah and seaweed. It went well with the warm soft bun that was served. The Norwegian Salmon & Matcha Beurre Blanc dish was well presented and delicious although I was at first taken aback by the sight of the Matcha sauce as it reminded me of Thai green curry, and that was a jarring thought for a split second. It was actually a Matcha beurre blanc sauce poured around the coconut ginger rice that resembled a risotto. The generous cubes of pan-fried salmon caramelised with teriyaki sauce were cooked perfectly. Topped with sautéed oyster mushrooms and edible flowers, the dish was an unusual fusion of different elements and flavours that worked surprisingly well.The dark chocolate truffle tart was extremely rich and chocolatey. With two layers of chocolate topped with tea-infused chocolate crumble on a thin pastry base, it was certainly a dessert only meant for those with a very sweet tooth like me. I was glad that I had opted not to include the scoop of ice cream that is usually served with the tart. With hindsight, I should have ordered a much lighter dessert. Due to its rich texture, the chocolate tart is better ordered with a pot of tea and nothing more.There is an impressive range of teas on the TWG menu, with prices ranging from SGD11 to SGD195.50. You will indeed be spoilt for choice. At just under SGD69/£38/USD52, it was money well spent for a delightful meal in a quiet, comfortable yet elegant setting. It is perfect for tea-loving tourists and overseas guests hosted by the locals here. Highly recommended

Lovely place to dine and a haven for tea drinkers. The Norwegian salmon served on a bed of coconut ginger rice with matcha sauce was out of this world. Love the tender and juicy salmon. The wagyu beef steak came second to the salmon. Chamomile tea with wildflowers has nice and flowery taste. Great ambience and enjoyed every moment.

This branch was very easy to locate from the North South Metro at Orchard. I had bought some of the tea already at a different branch where we had gone for brunch, but I wanted to get some more for friends back home.There was a very good selection of teas, and the assistance, although not as good as in the first shop was adequate

Reservations were not taken over the weekends and so we had to lunch there and stay on for tea as some friends were joining us only then. The restaurant nicely accommodated us and even set up the table for my group, though I mentioned again that it was just the two of us for lunch at present.The Norwegian Salmon and Black Cod were fresh and cooked to perfection. They were also exquisitely plated. Detailed descriptions of the dishes helped us in our decisions. Kudos to the chef and definitely must-try main dishes. The service was efficient and the team members took time to explain as we were unfamiliar with the tea-time menu

We got a lovely table. The ambience was perfect. We asked for water . It never cameWe ordered mushroom soup which was delicious. We then ordered our tea and macaroons. The tea came but no milk. The service was pathetic. We called out to the waiters. They were all standing and talking and in spite of repeated attempts to call them they ignored. Finally the milk came and by then the tea was cold. We asked for the bill and there were 4 waiters standing and talking but pretended to ignore us. Finally we walked to the counter to pay the bill and complained about the lack of service. There was one gentleman who said sorry. The rest thought we were idiots to complain about them. All I can say that they could have made it a wonderful experience but spoilt it at the en

We arrived at around 12.40pm for lunch and have the whole cafe to ourselves for a good 30 minutes. I am guessing most people come here for tea or to rest their feet after shopping. Because it was so quiet the chat among the staff became quite audible which I also noted in other reviews. We opted for the table overlooking Paragon. There are two tables there. At first it was fine, when the other table was occupied it became too tight for comfort. It was really back to back. Pun intended. It would be ideal to sacrifice one table or change the configuration for comfort. When we left an hour later, there was a sizeable crowd.One word to describe our lunch- sublime! My son especially loves the artisanal bun of the Wagyu Burger. I could taste the ocean from the prawn and lobster club. Big love for the chunky seafood coated with Thai basil and lemongrass mayonnaise. The chilled Maine lobster and Avocado timbale seasoned with a spicy citrus and honey dressing was a highlight for me. Very refreshing and delish.Our first visit for lunch and we can't wait to come back to check the tiger prawn squid ink linguine, cod and Wagyu steak which I have already shortlisted.

This was one of the nicest lunch experience I have had in ages. I went here to buy tea not realising this was a restaurant and decided to try it out. We had a two course lunch with the option of either the featured iced or hot tea and a choice of Mooncake which was gift boxed. The service was faultless, the view from beautifully decorated restaurant was fantastic and the food was delicious. I would definitely go back again

Ordered 3 mains, 4 macaroons and 2 scones. Wagyu steak and wagyu burger were good, especially the fries. Club sandwich tasteless. Macaroons and scones were good. I decided not to order tea and opted for free water instead. The waiter gave me a black face. My free water took super long to arrive and had to remind them multiple times before my water came. I felt also intimidated by all the male waiters standing around like security guards with stern looking faces. Certainly not the experience I expected from TWG
