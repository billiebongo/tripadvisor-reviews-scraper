Right at the heart of the crowd swarming orchard road, but still quiet enough to enjoy your meal.
Great smiling service by Shida and Rini.
Food and wine are good, little bit pricey but it is Marriott on orchard...
Good for a quick shopping break.

We went to crossroads cafe for a quick business lunch. Great place... Lovely streetside ambience, good food. The best part of our experience was service. Our host Hemani was very warm and courteous. She took an extra effort of making us comfortable and helping us with food choices. Would definitely visit this place again.

My wife and I used to love this place.Good (if expensive) food, cold beer and great location.We went back with the kids this weekend. After a very nice lady at the front desk, the service imploded.The kids chicken was dry. Their fries were under-cooked and cold.My wife's BLT looked great and the satay was incredibly small, expensive but good.My food just didn't turn up. I ended having to cancel my order as everyone else had finished.Our table and no-one else's in the restaurant was cleared. You had to ask for service, it was never offered. When I asked where my food was, the waiter looked embarrassed and then disappeared. I eventually had to ask another member of staff. Only then did our original waiter return to explain, but no apology.People sitting with empty plates and empty glasses.There were enough staff, so it's got to be a management issue. Great potential but failing big time at the moment.Unfortunately, it will always be full because of the location, so no one will try and fix the service issues

Buffett is excelent in a nice venue, many choices of foods including cook to order and seafoods. Service was lacking unfortunatley.
5
This is a wonderful place to grab a beer and watch the world go by. Food is pretty good, as is the service, there are a range of options and the nasi goreng is pretty good. I do think the food and drinks are expensive, but you are paying for the location and it being part of a luxury hotel. Only other downside is smoking is allowed and if you sit in the wrong place your evening could be ruined
5
I came here after disastrous events at Thai Embassy and it was a pleasure to sit here and have a coffee with highly motivated staff, particularly JANET, her continuous smile changed my day , and other staff were also in the same mode.Great place to stop for bite to eat or just a coffee
5
This venue has been a long time favourite of mine for breakfast or lunch in Singapore. The choice of food on offer is outstanding and they also have a 2 for 1 deal on breakfast a few days of the week. The chefs , especially the Executive Chef take time to engage with their customers, very nice touch. The star of the show is a young lady in training called Hemani. She has a lovely welcoming smile for all her customers, delivers the most fabulous service and clearly enjoys her job
5
I have come here a number of times and a few of the times I’ve been served by hemani. She’s attentive and lovely. And I have always wanted to spend more time due to the quality of service I’ve received. Keep up the good work hemani and Crossroads!
5
Great cafe ..Amazing service by Hemani ..Very polite and friendly without being overbearing .. I recommend this place ..

Well for the first time in 14 years living in Singapore I had lunch at this cafe! Nice terrasse love watching people walk by.The food was good, waiters nice but waiting time for 1 hamburger a bit long and for coffee I asked twice as I don’t have 1 hour.They bring coffee without the sugar- it wasn’t on my table.They brought the food without salt and pepper which were on other tables and not once they came by to refill my ice water! Had to request it.So service could be improved greatly for a cafe on Orchard road and the price range
3
It’s very busy even though it’s part of the hotel it’s on a busy crossroad. Good comfy seating and a few fans too to keep it cooler. Large bar are and lots of options for drinks. Food menu looked good but we only stopped for a beer. Service a little slow but beer lovely and cold. It is pricey though. 2 small tigers for 27 Singaporean dollars then tax and service on top.
5
Himani served us today and was very helpful and polite with a gentle and kind manner. Thanks Himani.
5
Favourite hangout after work. This evening Ms Justea made our day by remembering who we are and which meal period we usually come by. Miss Justea managed our usual expectations by explaining that they are running nearly full at the moment and the food may take longer than usual to arrive. I am touched by her honesty, as most businesses will simply want to fill their tables with people and leave them to wait and get grumpy. Her thoughfulness is much appreciated as we took turns to go window shopping at Tangs while waiting for the food to arrive. Beef Horfun excellent as usual, compliments to the Chef
4
Service : hotel style as expected. Price : hotel pricing as expected.A not so bad place to chill out doing people watching n catching up with friends over some nice wine or booze
4
Enjoyed a fantastic breakfast here. Food was good and coffee quite good also, but service outstanding. Himani was fantastic, quite friendly & professional. It only missed a star for me and gets 4/5 as coffee is too expensive in my opinion at $10 SGD a cup (isn’t everything in Singapore tho!). But I’ll still be back!
4
nice place for having lunch close by Orchard road! food was ok and fast. thanks Himani for the good service!
5
Nice terrasse to enjoy Singapore atmosphere, a little pricey though, but you get good service and good servings
5
The place is cozy and very relaxing ,the food is so nice with afordable price..The staff excellent service namely Jeff,Hema,Sha and Fenne
5
Great food and even better service. Hor Fun was surprising good with “wok-hei”. My family of four was served by Shida and we were well taken care of.
4
Crossroads is a frequent cafe every single time in Singapore. It is so vibrant , food is excellent and service so very friendly and efficient. Hemani in particular was outstanding and so very customer oriented. It was a pleasure being served by her. Choice of food is fairly limited but the quality makes up for it. Their Angus burger is a must. Location just perfect.
5
I was there to celebrate my girlfriend birthday. Shida was really sweet and explained the menu to us. When she found out its was my girlfriends birthday she prepared a cake for her. We are really grateful for your kind service
5
Am native but been away for years. Came here for some beers n ended up having a bottle of wine. Met this lovely lady from Punjabi. Most beautiful I must say but her service levels unequalled. She is hemani n we will and shall be back for more of such services. Good luck to her internship and she will do wel
5
At Crossroads cafe you will get the best cappuccino in Asia.It’s Illy cafe made by Janet.You can enjoy your coffee at a very nice location on the street side at a central place of Singapore
5
Nice food and Thanks for JanetFor the very good and friendly service.Nice relaxing atmosphere.Looking forward to come again
4
Great spot to people watch. Coffee was nice n enjoyed the service from Himani (our server)It’s a wonderful spot in the heart of Orchard Road.
4
Himani our server ushered us professionally to our table. Promptly took our orders with grace. Midway through the service, she came to check on us to see if everyone were enjoying our meal and made herself available for any request. With such demeanour, I'm confident she'll go on to do great things in the service sector
1
Very expensive restaurant. $10 for a can of soft drink ... absolutely ridiculous and could not justify paying that
5
Decided to have our family dinner at Crossroad and was greeted by a staff , Shida . She was kind enough to suggest us the the various item on the menu . I personally had the Wagyu Burger . It was a lovely experience at Crossroad and will definitely come back again and thank you Shida for serving us .
5
Cross roads has a great deal at the moment, they call it 1 for 1 but it’s a 2 for 1 deal. $42 plus taxes. We were greeted by Shida and she was pleasant and explained the deal very well. The buffet had pretty much all you want and more. We will be back.
5
My granddaughter and I were hungry and had just arrived in Singapore with our personal time clocks all messed up. This lovely outside restaurant serves breakfast all day and the idea of breakfast really appealed to us. The breakfast was delicious. The only problem was having to ask for the bill which isn't all that big a problem, right? Very nice place - part of the Marriott Hotel
4
Great place to have a food and drink and watch the people passing buy in busy part of Orchard. Ordered wagyu burger which is their signature dish. It was for sure one of the bust burgers which I've tried in Singapore. It came in a big portion with 2 patties, juicy and tasty with crispy bun. Service is generally good but could be a bit slow since the place is always crowded. Will definitely come back
5
I stopped by crossroads cafe for some breakfast and to kill some time. I was greeted by Himani, she was extremely friendly and helpful. Not only did I have a fantastic meal, Himani helped me with some travel questions I had in getting around Singapore.
5
Really enjoyed the friendly atmosphere but the standout service by Himani on the patio really made our mornings special. Great buffet:
5
Really enjoyed the ambience and service by the Trainer named Himani . She was very courteous and helpful .Keep it up !!
4
nice place to have a cup coffee. there is a bit of the problem of dialect but the quality of the food and beverages is excellent. expensive but worthy
5
The hospitality is pleasant and makes us feel welcomed. The trainee waitress who was serving us, Himani, was really friendly and pleasant and I could see her enthusiasm in her work. She is also patient and attentive and professional. She helped to make me and my family’s dining experience very enjoyable.
5
Ms justea always smile and alert. Then she very helpful and she know what I want before I said. Fish of the day is very fresh and delicious. The place sitting can look a lot peoples walk around good place rest and see people.... .fantastic is happy hour is start 11am till 6pm .beer cost $9.90 One pints.. Have local tiger draft, kilkenny. Kirin... Good enjo
5
Always the best to spend Saturday afternoon watching the world go by in Singapore with outstanding service care of Himani, Fenney and Shida
5
I’m very thankful for one of you worker named Shida. One afternoon, I was invited to the cafe for lunch by her. I was then being escorted to a table. As I wonder what was good for lunch, she recommended the Wagyu Burger. The burger that I ate was cooked perfectly and was really delicious. The beef patty was juicy and tender. I would definitely come back in the future. Good job!
5
We had a great Christmas brunch with the best service in Singapore; complements of Shida, Bala, Sha and Nicole! Great food, lively atmosphere and lead by a great Manager, Shaul
5
A great place to enjoy Breakfast in the heart of Orchard Road. Our waitress Himani provided excellent service - warm, friendly and very professional. Highly recommended.
3
I've been here for past few nights. Nice relaxing place. Great there's place to drink and smoke under shelter. Justea is always quick to notice my drink going empty and serve me before i have to call for service. This place is for sure going to be my regular hang out
5
We are staying here for 5 nights before moving on to Batu Ferringhi.Breakfast each day has been superb, with a lovely selection of food, great service and top location. Watch the world go by from an outside table, start the day in easy style. Shida looked after us very well, thank you
5
Crossroads cafe is a very nice cafe at Marriott Tang PlazaLocation on street side is greatFood western and local very good.Service is very friendly.Miss Himani is training the staff and she is doing an excellent job.She is very friendly and she has a great team
5
Shida gave an excellent service. I was having a hard time choosing wine to go with my food and she gave me a perfect wine pairing for the food. It was excellent
4
This is a great place to seat and watch the world go by. It is on a busy corner and many people walk by.The food menu has a good selection and there are smaller snacks available.The food is delicious and servings generous.The iced coffee is excellent.The staff are very friendly and cheerful but never hoovering more than necessary but will engage in conversation if that is what you want.One staff member is very memorable and that is Sha. Thankyou for you friendly welcoming smile.This is somewhere we have returned to and will return to time and again when we visit Singapor
5
The waitress Himani was friendly, professional and accomodating. The food too was very delicious! :
5
It was my first time dining in Marriott hotel Crossroads cafe located in the middle of Orchard road. The cafe was so crowded but I believe it was peak period. Was happy to say that I’m being served by ms.Shida whom always smile like all the time. She recommended us the signature dish of the cafe. Thumbs up for the wagyu beef burger and also for her service!! Thank you ms.ShidaFrom / Nandhini’s and Husband
5
Crossroad has nice ambience, good food for dinning also good for entertaining family and friends.Had experienced good & friendly services from Sami & Bala during our dinner
5
Visited this cafe for dinner and i must say the food was excellent and the service from the team (bala, krishnan, sha and jeff). They were very attentive and always smile. Thank you for making my dinner memorable.
5
My family and I have been frequenting Crossroads Cafe for almost a year. The staff makes this place fantastic (Bala, Sha, Krishnan and Sahul). Thanks for the best Singapore has to offer! Frank
5
Whether a solo business traveller or a local resident, The Table of Wisdom at Crossroads Cafe is the place to be for warm friendly service and great conversations with people from every corner of the world. A big thanks to Bala and Krishnan for always taking good care and bringing smiles!
5
Perfect food, nice place, very attentive personnel, special thanks to Himani. Can’t wait to come back again.
5
We were jet lagged from our flight from Australia & we needed a quick bite before bed - this place was great - quick attentive service - thank you Bala
5
I would just like to say how wonderful and attentive the staff and service are. Shida, Bala, Sha, Alex and Krishan to name a few. Nothing is too much trouble for any of these guys. Also a great place to people watch, whilst relaxing with a nice glass of wine after shopping on Orchard! Thank you to you all!
5
Very friendly staff. We were there with 2 kids. They were very patient and understanding. Himani, who attended us, in particular was great.
4
Nice cosy cafe that serves popular local dishes and dishes. The ambience is cosy and nice. My friend and I had enjoyed dining there. The waitersame and waitresses also serve the customers well. Recommended for everyone
5
We ordered a Wagyu Burger, Sizzling Lamb, Grilled Chicken Breast and Carbonara. The portion size is just nice and it's well seasoned. Very attentive service from Betty, Justea, Janet, and Shazana. Refil drinks and clearing empty plates just when we need it. Keep up the good work
4
Food is good and the service of Himani. She realized my coffee got cold when I asked her for a take away cup and offered me another hot one. It is heart warming. Nice & polite staff
5
The name very easy to remember 'justea no coffee' great sevice and very friendly. Food and drinks was excellent . I like the sizzling prawn and wrap very delicious. I like it and I very happy to heard the cocktail is one for one was very good.for justea.thanks justea I will come back
5
I’m coming here for the past 2 years the best place in Singapore. The food and the best cocktails you can get here.The service is the best if compare other places in Singapore they really know how to handle customer’s request.I would gif 10 out 10 for this place. The best service crew and bar manager Mr Shahul
5
I was served by these girls , shida and hemani. They both were so helpful. Food was good. Awesome place to hang around with family and friends.

Crossroads this time was a disappointment. We’d gone there to celebrate by daughters birthday. I had pre ordered a cake and was told to let the deli at the lobby know we’d arrived and they would send the cake over to the cafe. The lady at the deli tells me to get someone to collect. I told her it should be sent over since we’re dining outside. She was adamant. Wouldn’t budge. It’s highly disappointing that even a birthday cake couldn’t be transferred. Everything was about the customer walking around trying to sort it on our own and now becomes self service. Horrible experience. I had, by then, been so frustrated. I then go up to the manager of Crossroads told him there’s a cake and to please collect. He was nonchalant, again tells me to inform any staff when we need it. Now I’m furious. Why couldn’t he just handle it as a manager. Why pass the buck. Shouldn’t Marriott provide that service instead of me walking up And down And told to do things myself. Shouldn’t these things be done between staff? Why ask the customer , who is dining with family, to walk up And down trying to get the cake in order! Anyway, food took a while to come. The guys who came after us were served first. The chicken rice was of little to no taste. The calamari was soggy. Food just wasn’t as it should have been. To make matters worst one of the waitresses , while trying to pass between chairs , kept hitting on my chair. Finally told her what she had done. How annoying! We decided to take the cake home, wasn’t going to hang around and try to ask anyone else. They weren’t bothered. So so disappointing!
5
Shida a waitress in Marriott Crossroad lounge bar, she's a sweetheart.. She always attends to us with a great smile, great positive attitude with her service.We are very happy with the outstanding service she gave us... We hope when we come back crossroads we would to see her again.. thank you.Best Regards:Sue TaylorKevin Taylor

I stayed at Marriott from 23 Nov to 1 Dec 2017. Everytime I visited the crossroads cafe for drinks, breakfast, n lunch Shida was a breath of fresh air. She always greated with a smile n very professional appearance. She was very familiar with the latest specials all the time n very helpfull in choosing the best drinks n dishes on the menu. Even when they were very busy, she made sure we felt very welcome n got prompt service with a smile n professional approach. Outstanding person n hostess
5
Lovely place to hang out, good service and kid friendly! Food was great ! Good service from Shida. Very attentive and she always smile.
5
Had the crispy soft shell crab salad recommended by ms.shida.At first, I wasnt aware about the express lunch. Ms.shida suggested me to order the crab salad from the express lunch as it has the same portion as the ala carte. I am more than happy with the food and her service. Ms. Shida keep coming to my table to ensure that everything is alright. Good food and good service. I would definitely come back again!
5
Had a simple dinner at Crossroads With my friend. Food and ambience is nice. Praveen and Venkey were very nice ang accommodating not just to us but to everyone. It’s also a nice place to chill and have a drink after dinner.
5
Located at a prime place, this one is a “must” visit cafe with the best food and an amazing staff to look after you. Special thanks to Hemani for making an afternoon with my brother for life. Carrying a special memory in Singapore. Don’t forget... Crossroads Cafe it is !! Cheers
5
Hemani was an excellent server and recommended a very good chicken dish. Would definitely eat here again
5
Excellent service made a Sunday family dinner a great experience. Thank you, Hemani! Your friendly customer service make a difference in Crossriads cafe
4
A noodle dish and soft shelled crab with salad were the order of the day. The place was buzzing and we left just before midnight. The beer was good and so was the expresso martini. It was not cheap, but enjoyable
5
I would like to compliment the waitress that served me recently, namely Ms Shida. She was very patient and she guided me through the menu of popular items. Kudos to your staff!!
5
Great breakfast here, Himani was our lovely waitress. Friendly and professional. The food was great. Good start to our first day in Singapore
5
The Crossroads Cafe is a well located cafe on a major crossroads in Orchard where you can watch the world pass by, enjoy happy hour cocktails and wonderful food in very convivial surroundings. Our waitress Sha was extremely attentive, open to answering questions about Singapore and a very pleasant person. Would recommend an evening wind-down at the Crossroads
4
A nice place at a nice and busy area. Very good service, when we arrived and order something to drink we were immediately made aware that we still had 2 minutes of happy hour. Did not eat there so can not rate food, but the food meny looked very food. Drinks and beer was good. Lovely place to just sit with a cold beer and watching life go by
5
Like any afternoon lunch in singapore i was back at crossroads today under the care of Shida as usual the service was great my Cesar salad was full of extras bacon chicken and cheese complimented by my favorite Kilkenny it was a great experience thanks Shid
4
I needed a snack and stopped in the Crossroads Cafe while my friend went up to change. The veggie samosas were delicious and a decent deal by Singapore standards. But that's not why I'm writing this review. Janet was the only bartender behind the bar and she was pretty busy. She always had a smile on her face and even suggested the samosas for my snack. It was a pleasure to sit at the bar to enjoy a snack with a very happy bartender...Janet!!
5
I am a regular guest here , I have been coming here for long with my friends and been taken care of by shida ! Thank you for the great service ! Truly happy and feeling satisfied with the service here ! Keep it up love ! Will keep coming back in the future ! Food is awesome as always ! Loving the atmosphere here as usual !
4
I've been travelling from the UK to Singapore for nearly 20 years now and this is my favourite lazy day location when I get here. It's so easy as a lone traveller to sit back and watch the world go by, unhurried, whilst enjoying the wonderful food. The service is always friendly and attentive but I'd like to give a special mention to Hemani for her efforts yesterday. Thank you for making the day all the more pleasurable
5
Crossroads Cafe is one of my favorite places to hang on the weekends. It's convenient when you want a break from retail therapy and I can have my cigarettes and coffee at the same time! Plus, Henani is amazing. Look for her and she is sure to take care of you during your visit to Crossroads.
5
Loved the iced mocha here. Our waiter, Hemani, was really friendly and helpful. The service was really prompt. Perfect spot for coffee with friends
3
On every trip to Singapore, we use this cafe often and have seen it perform in various ownerships over 20 years. It always pleases, usually as a venue for a light lunch when we are well looked after and on this occasion, we were charmingly looked after by Hemani, thank you. A Nasi Goreng satisfied this time and a Tiger Beer for me and a Campari Soda for my wife. Always crowded and with something to look at and easy for the good shops close by. So I guess we will be back again soon
5
Singapore isn't really known for bars thanks to the crazy taxes but thisbar is an exception. good service, nice vibe and great drinks
5
The best bar to chill out in the Singapore centre, good services, cozy place and very friendly Waitress
5
He mani was my server and provided outstanding service. She was extremely professional and friendly. Her service exceeded my expectations
5
I’ve asked by a local food and Mrs. Shida was so kindle to supporting me. I’ve got a lovely local food.Fair price for quality. Other positive aspect is the localization.I strongly recommend
1
Had a light lunch two days ago and wanted to have a plane burger for dinner last night. .the place as usual is packed with tourists. The locals avoid it and for good reason. Ordered a plain burger medium raw and it arrived well done. There was not a trace of pink colour,, ( waited for the order over 20minutes) the waited saw my struggle with the burger and offered to exchange it. This time I did. It want to take a chance and I had ordered a raw level. The waited told me that he will rush the order. After almost 15 minutes, I caught the eye of the manager and complained. The dish arrived two minutes there after. Level of. Roiling medium well done. Showed it to the manager and he wanted to exchange it again but I had said that at this point I will try and eat it. The meat was dry and tuff. Left almost the whole dish as I got it. .The manager did not charge me with the dish which was the least he could do and which I had appreciated. I had also commented to the manager that the waiters are using the same rag to clean the tables without rinsing it or using Any detergent. The tables are sticky. I counted five tables being wiped in the course of 20 minutes with the same rag. A shame. As it was known for a good place for a quick bite to eat. Me, they will never see again.
5
Colleagues and myself knocked off and were finding a place to chill for food. It was already late and luckily the place was still open. The staff (SHA) had a perpetual smile on her face and ushered us in warmly.Service provided by SHA was excellent. She took notice of my colleagues ethnicity and asked if she wanted her meal served with a spoon and fork or chopsticks.Everything was pricey, but perfect.I wod come again for supper
5
Fun place to stop for food or drinks food if you’re in Orchard. Great drinks and service! Thanks Praveen and Venky!
3
Just had the local social (Hainanese fried rice) and was honestly expecting a little more. It was deconstructed and overall, the chicken wasn't well flavored. Not sure what I'd try if I visited a second time. As well, happy hour prices ($9/beer) are generally reflective of Singapore and your location off Orchard Road.
1
Wanted a cocktail after long flight from London. Ladies night offers $8 cocktails but gin and tonic was $34. Weak drink in smelly glass and flat tonic and they have the nerve to charge 10% service charg
5
Being one of the best location in Orchard road for a meal or drink, people watching is comfortable with the cool air conditioning and wide assortment of drinks from the bar! Also serving buffets and ala carte meals for lunch/tea/dinner, it offers a good mix of international and local cuisine! Food served are always fresh and replenishing is prompt! Local treats like laksa, prawn noodle are a nice choices but it’s stews, meat stations, and cold seafood platter are also alluring! A good place to start the exploration to Orchard Road with a hearty meal worth every penny!
4
After a hot and tiring trek in Orchard Road, we happened on the Crossroads Café at the Marriott and decided to stop off for some refreshments. They were offering two cocktails for the price of one, which meant I just had to drink two - what a hardship! Had The Preprandial cocktail, which was delicious - wish I'd asked for the recipe actually. We sat at the bar and enjoyed our drinks with a snack and did some people watching. The cafe is in a great corner location and offers an ideal place to chill for a while under the cooling fans - very welcome break after hiking in Orchard Road in the heat! Service was friendly and efficient, the food was nicely presented and very tasty. I'd be very happy to return and no doubt will at some point in the future. Have no hesitation in recommending to others
5
Thank you so much to all Crossroads team especially Shida, the happy hour deals here are the best compared to other restaurant out there I can say. Love the service and the food here!
5
I'm staying at the Marriott, Cross roads tonight ordered a chicken Cesar salad. When the food arrived... finally, it had anchovies. I didnt even catch the mistake until the waiter said something (chalk it up to jet lag). The waiters, Krishran and Bala made good and didn't charge me for the order. I love sitting and people watching at this restaurant. Wait staff is excellent, good food. The overhead big fans keep a nice breeze flowing..
5
Best place to chill and watch the world go by at the heart of orchard road. Decent food, great service and reasonably priced drinks.Thank you Nathan, Jeff and Betty for making our Sunday brunch great
5
I visit the Crossroads alot... Many many times a week. Simply because the service is outstanding by all the staff and your made to feel most welcome with genuine care. The atmosphere is always nice and above all for me there is a smoking table!! Above all else there is a very special member of staff by the name of Shida... Very caring, beautiful inside and out, professional, energetic and NEVER misses a thing when it comes down to a genuine caring service. I would recommend the Crossroads and all the members off staff above any other restaurant that I have visited across the world. 11!/10 for Shida and 10/10 for the rest of the staff...
5
Ordered the carbonara was good, love the milkshake too. lynn and sha gave an exceptional service and made my dinner enjoyable. Thank you lynn and sha!

Great service from our waitress Lynn. First choice from extensive wine list was a bottle of Cotes du Rhone which turned not to be available but sommelier offered a superb, and cheaper, alternative. Steak was prepared according to chef's recommendation and was equally superb. Have dined there before and will definitely be back again. Thanks again to Lynn for making our evening trouble-free

5
I come to the Crossroads Cafe a lot. The food is always good. I usually have the salads and the local food. Today I had the softshell crab and asian slaw. My dining guest had the cesar salad with extra poached egg and chicken. For cocktails, we had the Caribbean Kiss, Mojito and Comospolitan. The service was as always, friendly and welcoming, yes, I'm talking about you, Shida, whom I see often, but also your colleagues - sorry I don't have your names! Will be coming back again soon
4
I had a number of drinks here ,were Heineken beers on tap include Heineken, tiger , Kiren and a few others , the trouble with Singapore,beer is really expensive so better not to come here if you want a few beers However this cafe/ bar is great, good service nice people worth a visit
5
Shida is always happy and smiling. Which customers wantVery good at waitressing, always on time. I would definitely recommend people to come here. Atmosphere is great. Food is awesome. Not forgetting the service is great. I hardly come here but when I do . I have not regrets. One would never have to think twice to coming back and especially being served by shida.
5
I had one of the most refreshing cocktails! Pandan Fashioned. 2 thumbs up. Amazing staff. Very attentive! Hooray to Jeff, Nathan and Fenny for their awesome service! Definitely worth coming back for another round of cocktails
5
Best service by Fenny,Betty and Janet. They showing us what is a professional service in 5star hotel standard ,well done and keep it u
5
Just wanted to say thanks Exceptional service, as Specially Fenny Betty make us some awesome drinks in this evening.

We ordered the Mie goreng and chicken curry.Both dishes were very good.Service was fast and polit
4
I went there for lunch with my friend.. Its nice view to sit outside and see the crowd walking around.We ordered the wagyu burger which very nice!And we also tried the "lunch express promos" sgd18.90 angus steak sandwich, not so nice i think.. The beef get too dry.. But i love the mushroom..Overall, this place is good to hang out with friend..And i will be back again to try other dishes.
4
Recently visited with parents. Good hospitality. Very friendly staffs. Special regards to Venky , Brian, Pravin & Nathan, good work keep it up. But poor music selection. Wish it had been better.

Great service,even if you come down to eat late. Exceptional service especially the guys who manned the Egg Station,service with a huge smile and genuine interest in you the customer. Really great food too. We had the breakfast as part of a package I don't think we would pay $98.00Singapore for two people each day

Went for dinner last night. I had the Wagyu burger and my wife had the asparagus and pumpkin salad will added sirloin beef. We were expecting good food based on prior reviews and yes - it was really good. Clearly the chef is very dedicated and has an eye for detail. Serving sizes were also generous. All up it was excellent and we want to eat there again before we leave. Location great too
5
Awesome food. The Laksa is worth the only reason to call thru. We stopped off after arriving straight from the airport
5
Thank you shida for spending most of your time talking to me well recommended cafe for food and drinks , really love the ambiance here , service is good , very efficiency . Thank you so much ..
5
I would recommend this café / restaurant. The service was exceptional. The waitress, Betty and Lyn were highly efficient and extremely personable and would recommend them to any employer. The food was fantastic and fairly priced and in a great location. I would highly recommend this restaurant / café to everyone

Thanks for the good service and thanks to Santosh for his excellence service which made us enjoyed our dinner and had a great time. Will come back again for our next anniversary. Thanks Marriot for the anniversary gift.

I have to declare my hand here and admit that I am a Platinum for Life member with Marriott Rewards but I cannot fault this restaurant, coming here for 20 years now, yes 20 years. And in 20 years I think they have changed the menu only three times!!I always sit outside under the fans and watch the world go by. I travel alone on business very often and this is one of my favourite places in Singapore to watch the world go by while enjoying fine dining and great, professional service.My wife and I were in Singapore for the F1 Grand Prix this weekend and we enjoyed a delicious lunch before we headed to the race. This review covers my dinner tonight, but the photos show the lovely salads we had for lunch on Sunday.Crossroads has a great "two for the price of one" cocktail promo and I recommend the bar here if you enjoy cocktails. The atmosphere is great and the bar tenders know their stuff. They also have a great range of draught beers, including Guinness, Heineken and Tiger.I had the prawn cocktail starter and followed with the Risotto with Scallops and Boston Lobster...pushed the boat out a bit, and challenged Lynn to ask the Chef if I could have both of the "options" with the Risotto. Lynn came back with a big smile and said 'no problem" to my request. All the staff are professional, and know their product very well. Lynn has been a trainee for a while now and its time to move her up to the top table...she is charming, confident and very professional.I thoroughly recommend Crossroads Cafe for breakfast, lunch or dinner...and/or cocktails!

We decided to have dinner here after a long day shopping as it was located just nice in Orchard. At first we was indecisive about what to eat, but our waitress Sha was kind enough to recommend us their promotion item which happened to suit our appetite. So we ordered a Jack Daniels rib and Wagyu burger. Both the dishes were great and cooked just to the right tenderness as we requested. Excellent job from the chef and the service provided by Sha! Definitely will come back again

the localization is topright in the middle of Orchard Streetafter shoppingit s a nice place in order to enjoy the good and huge buffetthe terrace is pleasant you can feel the beat of the cit
5
We were here on a friday evening , No happy hours but , we guys were lucky that our host was a young guy named Sukhpreet, he introduced us to the cocktail promotion , and he recommended us BBQ Ribs , which were delicious !! We'll Surely be back!! Thanks sukhpreet, for your recommendation and service , keep it up!
5
Ms. Nur Shida was very attentive to our table. I caught a little bit cold after a long overnight flight from Tokyo. I just needed some simple hot noodle soup. The weather was nice, so I got a terrace table. It was quite comfortable. Ms. Shida offered tea refills and cleaned the table a few times. That is really what we expect during breakfast hours when we get a little bit morning clumsy and moody. Thanks.
5
I would like to recommend Shida from crossroads cafe , very friendly service and always focused in her work. Very fast paced service as well. She and team are willing to extend a helping hand and always accommodating to my needs and wants. Despite the expensive food, I'm more than willing to spend it on the service and delicious food. Well done Team
5
Excellent service from Betty, she always keep in smile and very kindly, I was impressed with her service, and the Angus burger that I order taste very nice too, I will be going back next time
5
Cappuccino was awesome and the atmosphere was very great . Janet serve with her profession and was always smiling at me. It's a nice experience
5
Lovely venue, exceptional service , great staff , great food. Lovely place to hang around with friends especially on the weekends. Thank you to service staff, Shida to recommend us happy hour beers
5
Hello, Came all the way from Philippines for work, and I know i don't really have to write a review and i hardly do, but a particular waiter I met in this cafe/restaurant made me want to write this willingly. I didn't catch her name, i think it was Shita, or Shida? Her service was excellent! I was having a really stressful day from all the work related what-nots, I'm thankful she greeted me politely and chatted with me, she clearly turned my whole trip around! Food was great, but this cafe's staff service made it a memorable one for me! Til then
5
My wife and I Spent a very pleasant afternoon great offer. happy hour was start at 11am till 6pm one pint of draft beer .Mojito.lychee martini, redwine,white wine, spirit.,all was SGD 9.90. MONDAY TO THURSDAY. Service was excellent .specially Service name shida, Justea,. throughly impressed with the Service.THANKS SHIDA,JUSTEA
5
Dropped by to have a quick lunch and happened to be they have this Express Lunch (30 mins guarantee). I ordered the Steak Sandwich and it arrived within 20 mins . Shout out to Sha who was being very attentive all the time. Definitely recommended for those who are in a hurry
5
Awesome place. Sukreet was polite and helpful which made the experience better. TOP! I'll definitely be back back for more
5
My wife and I spent a very pleasant afternoon at Crossroads Cafe recently, which must boast the best location in town for casual dining, situated as it is (and as its name obviously indicates) at the junction of Scotts and Orchard Roads. Service was brisk and efficient during our visit, with a special mention going to Sukhpreet, who was most attentive and helpful. The food menu contains many items worth trying. The Yong Chau fried rice is especially good, as is the charcuterie board (for two). My wife had an excellent starter of a prawn cocktail, followed by a local speciality, chicken rice, which was also impressively presented and substantial. If you are looking for a relaxing place to people watch as you enjoy a cold beer or two, you can't do better than Crossroads Cafe at the Marriott Hotel.
4
A great venue for drinks and food, excellent staff and service, Sukhpreet the waiter always happy to help
5
The café has to be the best located on the corner of Orchard and Scott. I have been having a beer or two (cannot afford anymore !!) almost everyday of my stay and am thoroughly impressed with the service. Thank you Sukhpreet :
4
Service was excellent, from the various hot stations chefs to the service staff. The spread is not bad and the drinks available are very extensive. Having freshly squeezed juices is a great bonus too.
5
Been regular here.every time î come to singapore. Staff in crossroad café always welcome me especially Alex, Sha, bala and krishnan and they give à really good service and always smalling. Good place to b
5
The food here is fantastic. I'm a singaporean and I find that the Chicken rice here is true to the singaporean flavour and the baby back ribs are just as fantastic. Special shout out to @sukhpreet for the warm hospitality during our dinner. Thanks
4
The food here was good and the service was up to standard. Had a wagyu burger and it was simply awesome and huge and the price is reasonable. coffee was decent as well. Overall, a nice place to chill and to have a simple meal
4
Every time I visit Singapore, I make it a must to visit this place located at the corner of Scotts and Orchard Road. Visited twice for late night drinks/food during my four day visit to Singapore. A good variety of drinks and local food will keep everyone happy and satisfied. One plus point is that one get to see lots of activities at the corner spot as well. Frequented by Singaporeans and non-Singaporeans alike and open till late. Staff very attentive and quick. Wonderful vibes! Highly recommend to wind down after a hard day at work!
5
Me and my Boyfriend visited Crossroads under recommendation from our friends. It was slightly packed as it was a weekend but we were promptly seated. Once we were seated a staff member by the name of Shida welcomed us by introducing herself and offering suggestions of food. We tried the Wagyu burger and it was delicious! Even thought we were full after that mean Shida even offered dessert suggestions and chatted with us for a bit. We were from Korea and coming to Singapore was new for us. Shida suggested tourist spots to visit and shopping areas. She even circled areas for us. All in all we would like to commend the excellent service of Shida.
5
Services are extremely fantastic , have all kind of spirit... really enjoyed day with friends.. thank you guys.. will make it again...
5
Been at crossroads to meet my friends, while waiting for them service staff Jeff recommend a drink and light snacks. He is very quick and alert whenever we need service. Thanks to the manager incharge Nathan who checks out table time to time. Keep up the good service guy
5
Hi, Although, I am in Singapore. I used to visit our crossroad cafe oftenly with my colleagues and friends.I am really happy about the cocktails served by Mr.Venky (Bartender) is really in authentic taste and flerished the moments with tht ambience.Thnks,Guha

I have been to Marriott Cafe a few times with different friends and family members, always had a great experience. However 2 sundays ago (13th August) i had a bad experience at crossroads cafe. I'm a club marriott member and i have a $50 dining voucher that is expiring so i thought i would just visit crossroads since i have never been there. I was there with a friend and when we reached there, we asked the staff if there is a aircon/indoor seating area. The staff pointed us to the marriott cafe area and said we could go inside. I was glad that i can go inside and still order from crossroads. After we went in, we stood inside for a while as we were not sure where to go/where to sit. A staff came and asked if we need help. I explained that i wanted to order from crossroads and i was told i can sit inside, so this staff asked if i want the buffet, i said no. So i asked again if i can sit indoors and still order from crossroads, he said we can go to the lobby area. I was surprised but still followed his instructions. We went to the lobby area, sat down at a table with only the menu for lobby lounge. We felt out of place and looked around for assistance but it was only about 10 mins later did a staff came to ask if we want anything. I asked again if i can sit here and order from crossroads then i was told that i cant and crossroads only has a open air seating area. So we went out to the open air seating area again. Before coming i had checked my membership terms and conditions to make sure i can use both the $50 dining voucher and the 30% membership discount concurrently. I wanted to verify that i can so i asked the staff before ordering but i was told i can only use either one but not both at the same time. We went ahead to use the $50 voucher for our meal. We ordered a wagyu burger and a tiger prawn aglio olio. I must add that the food was good, just the overall experience wasnt. We felt like the staff didn't take us and our enquiries seriously
3
Went there today and tried the breakfast took the a la carte menu a latte and blueberries pancakes, meal came quickly pancake enormous with strawberries and blueberries, coffee was ok but not great expensive latte full of froth .But what I disliked is two people chain smoking on the bar next to me most unpleasant whilst you are eating the overall experience was not great and left qiuickly
5
We were there as a family with 3 young children's over the weekend for staycation to celebrate my hubby birthday. We tried the international dinner buffet and have our breakfast in this same restaurant and we would like to take this chances to thank all the service crew especially the restaurant manager Mr.Sahul and Ms.Shida on our breakfast round.Thank you for the enjoyable dining experience,we all enjoyed your delicious food and fantastic customer service from all the service crew!We will be back
3
I have just purchased the most expensive Milkshake of my life. It cost almost £10 a time. I know that it was attached and probably part of the large hotel but for what we got it was ridiculously price. Had I not had such a thirst I would have up sticks and left after seeing the price. Be warned
4
Food was good and we really love it.However service was a bit slow and a bit pricey.We love the location of this place and we will be back. Service could be improve
1
Were there pn a Sat evening with hubby and daughter. Waiter did not understand our orders much of the time, despite us pointing to the item on the menu. Restaurant manager gave no welcome and thank you, just started clearing the table. Signature burger was so-so, fries were not as nice as McDonald's, buns look like Gardenia, overpriced Hokkien Mee had tasteless prawns and squid which were obviously not cooked in the broth as they should be. Better off eating at hawker centre, including the burger. It is ok to pay a premium sometimes to eat hawker and simple burger in luxury but neither the quality of food nor the service deserved to be called luxury
5
I was in Singapore for two weeks and stayed near the Crossroads Cafe. It became my kitchen and home-away-from-home between meetings with breakfast, a few lunches and several more dinners there. It was all Marriott staff and they were, to the person, both great company and totally professional too. The outdoor cafe was really a great place to sit, think, and view life moving by. I want to thank Jeff, Justea, Shida, Sha and Balik (last name may be off, sorry, I cannot read my own writing). Given the experiences there, next trip there I will be staying at the Marriott Tang Plaza Hotel. I travel globally and stay in a lot of nice places... this is why I am calling this one out as being exceptional.Keep doing whatever you do to have such fine help! All the best, Chris Capp
5
Great restaurant to have a quick bite and see what's going on in Singapore. Some of the best people watching ever! Really nice menu and fantastic atmosphere.
5
We only had about 15 minutes left before they close their breakfast buffet but Justea still welcomed our presence with genuine hospitality instead of making us feel like we were on her way. She made sure we had what we needed and checked on us occasionally. She readily gave me a decorated plate with a happy birthday sign on it when I told her it was my husband's birthday that day. The other lady staff was attentive to our needs/ requests as well, always with a smile on her face. It's a shame that her name slipped my mind. Thank you again, Justea and to the rest of the staff of Crossroads Cafe, Marriott, for your awesome service
5
My wife and I had dinner here last night, food and drinks were great but I must comment on our waiter Sukhpreet, he was excellent!!!! He made great suggestions about what to drink and eat and was just a pleasure
5
The food, the atmosphere and the location are all 5 star but what stands out is the hospitality. Couldn't have asked for better service from Nathan and Sukhpreet. They both are fantastic gentlemen and easily added an extra star (6 stars) for us. Thank you gents and we'll definitely be back
3
Centrally located corner for a light snack & drinks while watching the hustle and bustle parade of shoppers, locals and tourists. A pretty decent spot to snack on the local kaya toast with coffee or a perhaps savour a bowl of congee
5
This is now a regular place for me and Mrs B. The staff, Sha, Bala and Alex in particular make every occasion a special one. Since we arrived earlier this year we have always been made welcome and it has made 'landing' in Singapore easy. It's a great place to people watch and the food is always on point. Get a table under a fan and you will be a fan of Crossroads!
5
My wife and I got out together after an eternity. She is a luxury hotel Laksa lover ;) most people in Singapore laugh if you go to a nice hotel and order Street food- but to be honest the Laksa here is really lovely. Also excelled t was the wait staff, in a very busy place they were prompt, courteois and gentle. Forgot my Sparkling, but remembered quick enough to not make it glaring.Honourable mention to young Sukhpreet - crisp, very courteous and still clued on enough to ask us to review his place of work.Well done all around.Best
5
Had a family breakfast buffet at crossroads cafe by the Marriott hotel. Food great and service even better. Was reasonably priced at $19 for children and $32 for adults and included coffees.
4
The cafe is open air and one can enjoy the road view and watch passerby. The service was good and so was the chocolate brownie.
5
Food is fabulous and service excellent, Sukhpreet really looked after us, really is one of our favourite places to meet and eat
5
Originally chose this eating establishment because it looks inviting and clean. The food was very good, arrived hot and in a timely manner. The atmosphere was pleasant and everyone appeared to be having a nice time. The service was good, our waiter Sukhpreet went above and beyond to make sure that our dining experience was good and nothing was too much trouble. Thank you Sukhpreet you are truly a nice guy. We will return to the restaurant when we are in Singapore again
5
Our family of four stopped in for breakfast while strolling along Orchard Road. We got the breakfast buffet and were served by Shida. Shida was very professional and attentive to our requests, especially with regard to our children's orders. The buffet was amazing and a good value as well. Thank you Shida and Crossroads Cafe for making our day! We hope to be back on our next trip to Singapore.
5
Visited three times in the last week and was attended to by trainee Sukhpreet. I enjoyed my food and appreciated the attention to detail, manners and kindness shown each time. Location is a winner. Thank you
5
Lovely location for a drink and a bite at the Marriot hotel. Relaxed atmosfeer, good food and great drinks. Host Sukhpreet makes you feel welcome
5
Service Staff Shida provided Excellent, Attentive Service! Always Gracious, Smiling, Hardworking and Helpful with Great Anticipation towards our request. Good Food with Good Service always! Keep it up Shida
4
Right place to have late proper dinner with view as not many places still open order after 10pm. Their pasta taste yummy. Like the orange juice too. Quick service. Nice staff. Please provide more vegetarian & gluten free food, not many choices for us now
4
Found it on tripadvisor when i need another proper dinner on late night. They really still open order til late which difficult to find such place in singapore. Their pasta was taste good. Would be better if they have gluten free food & more vegetarian food option
4
A great place with a pleasing atmosphere to rest, re-energise, refuel and cool down after a hectic morning sight seeing and walking. Good choice of food and great service, in particular, Sukhpreet, who was very professional, friendly and provided excellent service
5
Super friendly and very attentive staff. Sukh Preet along with his colleagues did a great job. Always love coming back for good food and service. Thank
5
I have order the beef ho fun and Curry chicken rice at lunch it was amazing. The beef ho fan the meat was tender and smooth it was outstanding in my expect .Curry chicken is perfect the potato was nice and the chicken also good in curry flavour. Excellent !But the beverage price was a little bit high of the market
5
The cafe is aptly named because we always felt a part of the pedestrian activity on Scotts Road even when we sat at tables that are farther away from the sidewalk. We had two breakfasts and one lunch at Crossroads Cafe. The quality and variety of breakfast foods was the best that we can remember in Singapore. For lunch we had chicken curry and rice, a Madras curry. As before at the time of our last review, there was a shortage of meat in the cuts of chicken. The wait staff in our area, Ms. Fenny, always seemed to be on duty, and she was very helpful and willing to make everything easier for us
5
Blend of outdoor and indoor hospitality. Excellent menu - buffet or a la carte. Happy hour makes it incredibly affordable place. Excellent food coupled with great service and location
4
Always a delight to din here at C-Roads. Staff are friendly staff (Justea, Kent, Shida) alway have a warm welcoming smile and service. Keep up the good work!
5
I was recently dining at the Marriott on Orchard Road in Singapore and I was lucky enough to be served by a very diligent and hard worker by the name of Sukmpreet . I'm certain if you get the chance to be served by him you will feel the same way and I hope this young man makes it a long way in the service industry as he deserves to
5
We had a delicious breakfast at this cafe which is attached to the Marriott on the corner of Scott's and Orchard . We were served by a lovely lad (Sukhpreet) who had recently started his training there. 10 out of 10 Sukhpreet ! Thoroughly enjoyed the experience 
5
Bala waiter/krishna and MJ is very helpful to make the dinner great. We really enjoyed and spent whole night in this great restaurant at the marriot Singapore
5
I had Cocktails at the Crossroads Cafe Bar and my bartender Joanne was fabulous and showed off her mix-master skills with great conversation and charisma. The drinks were very good and the atmosphere relaxing. Check it out and when you do ask for Joanne
5
After another great day in Singapore, time for a celebration drink with my wife. What better place to go. Best service by Joanne with a smile, thank you..
5
Thankyou justea and shida for taking your time to serve us ! Such a good sevice :) would recommend my family and friends here for the delicious hokkien noodles and char keay teow (local
5
We are always impressed with the service rendered by staff from Crossroads. They never fail to leave an impression at our every visit.6May2017 visit was just for tea but attention given by Sukhpreet and Shida was such that it made us feel so important.Sukhpreet was very attentive and had the initiative to understand what the customers wanted. Though he is only an intern there, he has shown his love for service.Shida was also very attentive to all the patrons at the cafe
5
First time in Singapore and visited Corner Cafe, great place to sit and watch the world go by. Excellent food and drink with exceptional service, especially Sukhpreet who was attentive, friendly and helpful. Would definitely recommend a visit
5
I've been coming to the Crossroads at the Marriott for so many years now, it never disappoints. Great food, great wine and the best people watching position on Orchard Rd! Crossroads please keep up the good work!Tonight I had the angus burger, which was yummy, their pasta and snacks are also amazing!
5
Once we found the Crossroads bar and cafe, we returned several times. Good location on a corner near Tangs. We also ate here and would have no hesitation recommending
2
The great location of Crossroads Cafe on Orchard Road is a trap for unsuspecting tourists. The seats, table, and everything about the place is so old and worn that it should be demolished. I've been here twice now for breakfast or brunch and the food is average or below. At $50++ for brunch there are better choices. Head to the Four Seasons, Hyatt, or St Regis
5
At the corner of a busy sidewalk, Crossroads is an open air but completely covered cafe/bar with fans to keep people cool on a hot and humid day. It opens at 7am when it serves as outdoor seating for the Marriott Hotel breakfast Cafe and closes past midnight. Its a kid friendly cafe where you can choose to sit at a table, the bar, or long smoking table at the edge of the cafe, in short something for everyone. Its a great spot to entertain yourself if you like people watching or just sitting outdoors. The menu has the basics, nothing fancy, but from what I've tasted, good. Its a full bar with Guiness on tap. The service is attentive and very good, especially in the afternoons/evenings when Jag and his team have to work the busy period. As for price, its Singapore, on Orchard road, etc, ...reasonable. Hard to find a place on Orchard/Scotts road that can give you a 'full experience' from morning to night
5
I spent my time here to waiting my friend for quite long. But their service staff were periodically approach to me checking my satisfaction, need etc.. I could feel that they are really concern me taking care of me. Especially Ms.MJ. She's really good at recommend the drinks and foods. It was really nice.Thank you so much for your service, i will definetely visit again
4
Crossroads Cafe is located at the entrance to the Marriott Tang Hotel. We stopped there because we noticed the lunch menu has a lot to chose from and there are giant fans keeping the seating area cool. We ordered 2 items from the lunch express menu and 1 from the regular menu. The service was excellent.A tip for others is be careful about ordering refills. We knew they weren't for free, but we didn't realize just how much they were as the price of the first glass is included in the price of the lunch express item. We learned the hard way that the specialty iced teas go for as high as S$11.We would definitely go back again because of the good food and great service (and those monster fans), but we'd be a lot more careful about ordering drink refills
5
Great place for a drink on a hot Singapore day on Orchard Road, the main shopping area. Sit outside in the shade and under fans and watch the people go by. Singapore isn't normally known for their keen service but the workers here are very attentive to take care of you. Excellent service and nice conversation with trainee Sukhpreet. Will continue to go here when Girlfriend is shopping
4
Great location at junction of Scotts Road and Orchard Road, at the Marriott Tang Plaza. They open till late 2am on weekends. Good local comfort food like Hokkien mee & Beef Hor Fun. As expected for a hotel restaurant, prices are high especially drinks. Good discount if you use Amex Platinum credit cards
3
Went here only for the happy hour as they have buy 1 free 1 for all the cocktails. However I didn't find anything special with the cocktail, actually more on the disappointing side for the taste.
1
after spending 3 days in Singapore and going back to hotel on one particular night just thought I would share my experience of having my pants took down at this particular establishment when upon entering premises and asking for a pint and a half of tiger beer for me and the mrs drinking it and taking in the ambiance of the surroundings was presented with a bill for 44 Singapore dollars about £30.00 in sterling,the after effects of this on being revived by concerned patrons was that I am still on anti depressants 1 month later and by the way the beer was cra
5
Crossroads Cafe is a great place to relax and unwind after a hectic workday in Singapore. It provides international cuisine and some select wines and beers! Food taste is very good! Staff is friendly and helpful. Just order a drink and soak in the hustle bustle on Orchard Road, it's a nice experience
5
The cafe atmosphere is very enjoyable.Yang Chow fried rice is very good,very recommended for fried rice lover.The Five Island Iced Tea is a good taste :)
5
Good service from MJ she is from Korea. Excellent service from her. Good recommendation, must come back more. Highly recommended for their food and drinks.
4
Nice cafe with good views of the pedestrian hustle and bustle along Orchard road. I really enjoy their yang chow fried rice, really good flavor. Service is friendly and efficient. Prices are high even by Singapore standards but given the location I guess that's to be expected
5
Excellent experience for dinning! It's so famous for breakfast and brunch!What a wonderful atmosphere! Elegant dishes by handsome Chefs
5
Extraordinary customer serviceGreat good ask for fish and fries Excellent to hang out with friendsAny issue ? Jag will be there to help you. He is the manager.. best manager eve
4
Always like going here for a couple of drinks and the opportunity to view people of all kinds scampering around this very busy corner of Orchard Rd. Big draw is their 1 for 1 cocktail (no beer) happy hour...always. Cant share, so means you have two drinks all to yourself, which if you feel so inclined is not bad. Service is average, at best and on a good day, so be prepared for the uncaring, rather unhappy staff to serve you. Always a drama to get a glass of water, but at least you dont have to pay for the privilege as you do in so many other places around Singapore now. Food not bad, but pricey
4
After a long day of touring, the Crossroads Cafe was a nice break. tasty afternoon beverages and a great view of the streets. very relaxin
5
Was there with friends over the 2 weekends as the cafe food quality is decent for the price. In addition, I was really impressed by the servicing staffs attitude which is another reason why I go back again. Justea is simply fabulous and attentive. I had a very good experience over there and I will definitely be back again.
4
I was not incredibly hungry, so I stopped in for a satay. Their peanut sauce is amazing! The food was filling and the service polite.
5
Always great service and food, especially from Alex and Shida! Such a friendly welcome and great service, they make the cafe what it is
4
Great food choice, great wine selection, ok waiter service. Sometimes you can be hit by the cigar smells in the smoking section which is unpleasant, but not the fault of the cafe (unless they make the whole place non smoking)
5
Im a regular visitor and this is one of the best places in sg. Amazing food,Atmosphere n lots of halal n non halal food
5
We were looking for somewhere with a bit of life and a bit of bustle for a late reasonably-priced breakfast and found it in Crossroads Cafe. On the face of it, S$40 for a buffet breakfast sounded a bit steep but the two-for-one offer for the pleasure of sitting out on the terrace overlooking the steady flow of pedestrians and traffic was a deal well worth having. The food was excellent with a very wide range of East and South Asian choices as well as standard American and European fare. We made multiple visits to the food counters but still sampled only a small selection of what was on offer. Service was light touch but attentive. Overall an excellent way to spend a leisurely breakfast hour and it certainly dispensed with the need to find lunch.
4
Stopped off for lunch without any research during a shopping trip. The plan was to grab a beer. Ended up ordering food. We were pleasantly surprised. A decent club sandwich and fried soft shell crab. Not a cheap pastime. Especially at £10 a pint for beer. However, it did the job. Probably wouldn't visit again but, no complaints
5
I had just celebrated my friend's birthday at Crossroads Café. The service staff, Mr Krishnan was very attentive to customers' needs and very friendly. He will check to ensure that we are served duly and food are good to our taste buds. To add on, knowing that was my friend's birthday he went the extra miles to give us desserts to add on to the celebration mood. thank you for such excellent staff - Krishnan - keep it up and thumbs u
5
This is a great place: cool, open to the street, with a variety of seating (tables, benches - smoking and non-smoking. You can watch the passing parade, especially people heading to Orchard MRT station.The wait staff were friendly, especially Shida who looked after me. I was especially pleased that she told me of the promotion - 2 bottles of Korean beer with the meal. The Korean promotion was a good idea for me
5
Staying as a guest in the adjacent Marriott it was an easy choice to go eat in the closest bar, but it was a good choice. Right on the corner of the street its great for people watching and the beer is cold. I recommend the cezar salad with tiger prawns - amazing
5
I want to share the many great diners I had in Crossroads Cafe. After long working hours it is still open for you late evening . You can enjoy the Terrasse like I do if you do not want to be in cold and Air-Conditioned Area. Staff is very nice especially MJ who gave me a great attention yesterday. I truly recommend the Red Snapper and All Burgers 
4
My husband was lured in by the happy hour signage so we stopped in at 5.30 for a drink and an early dinner after a long day of travelling. We ordered the house whisky, lychee Martini, club sandwich and the fried rice, all of which we enjoyed. it would have been nice to have some more cocktail options on the happy hour menu than just two. The staff were friendly however as they became busier it was hard to get their attention. Free WiFi was a great bonus too. We would definitely visit again
5
Want to cigar, smoke, good food, close to anywhere, try this place , so save, clean, friendly and the beer so good
5
Great selection of food. Fresh juice. Juice bar. Omelette station. Noodle station. Many western and Asian choices available. Even if I wasn't a hotel guest, I'd come here to eat. If you come for dinner or drinks, lots of good people watching if you sit outside
5
Every time I visit Singapore I make sure that I go to the Crossroads cafe at the Marriott hotel in the centre of the city for the most amazing cocktails money can buy. But the good news is that between 3 PM and 6 PM quite often they have a special happy hour promotion. And despite the discounted price the standard of the cocktails are maintained at a very high level. Today I enjoyed Lychee Martini cocktail which were absolutely delicious. Cheers
4
Best for people watching as it is very busy pedestrian area. My favourite chocolate milkshake ever. A little pricey perhaps compared to something like a hawkers stall but one is paying for a pretty neat spot
2
Staying at the Marriott - this was convenient to stop for lunch. Overpriced and the food was uninspired. Will eat remaining meals at the local restaurants & food courts
3
Having just arrived in Singapore and looking for somewhere to eat the Crossroads cafe looks to be a gem. It has a great location with the benefit of Alfresco dining. However the food on this occasion failed to match the atmosphere and was expensive to boot.
5
While its not my first visit to Crossroads, it is always top of my mind to visit after a day long shopping along Orchard road with its great food.Last Friday was a day of brilliant food and service! I brought my sister to try and its her first time there. As she was pregnant, the service staff noticed and quickly brought a cushion for her. Alot of other little gestures which made our day! (adjusting table settings so we can better reach our food, volunteer to help pour the ketchup out from bottle w/o me having to shake hard)Good job team & thanks for making our day
1
The location is great (with outside seating allowing you to escape the ubiquitous aircon), the food is fine but the service is absolutely appalling - slow, inefficient and sometimes even rude, which is unusual in Singapore
5
After a long time i came back to Singapore for again a business meet. As one of my colleague was staying near Orchard, we thought we can have some dine and wine in the Crossroads Cafe. I really enjoyed some starters and some drinks with my colleague. As usual I went for 1 plus 1 cocktail. I really enjoyed the evening with some new drinks like Frozen Margarita and Bull Frog. It was really tasty and well presented by Bartender Venki. He was so friendly and I gave him a choice to have some different drink. Venki suggested and mentioned Bull Frog and Frozen Margarita. I had Frozen Margaritas around the Country but this one is quite different from others. It was really nice and worth to drink. I will to appreciate Nathan and Madhan for their friendly service along with Bartender Venki who made our meeting a remarkable moment. Keep it up Crossroads Team !!!
4
This is the bar to go to when you don't know where to go for drinks on Orchard. Unless other famous cocktail bars area like duxton or Amoy st, Orchard only serve standard bar. And this is certainly quite a good one as a hotel bar. Worth going if just a causal post work or friendly drink.
5
Crossroads Cafe located at the Marriott Tang Plaza is the most buzzing place I have seen. You can sit here endlessly and and keep looking at the busy Orchard Road .I had lunch at this cafe twice and was absolutely happy with both service and food. The staff is extremely alert and in their toes all the time. The first time I had ordered for apple and carrot mix juice which was very refreshing . I ordered for grilled chicken breast with some quinoa. The chicken was done well and delicious. The top perfectly crisp and inside nice and succulent.The second time I ordered for avocado and banana shake and Singaporean Laksa. The shake was very well made and healthy I guess. The laksa was a big portion. It was very flavourful and had good portions of prawns and other seafood. I would be frank enough to say I was not able to finish it not because I did not enjoy but because it was too big a dish.Overall a very good Cafe to sit and enjoy your day. I recommend this place definitely for a quick meal 
5
Nasi Goreng and Porcini Mushroom Risotto were our choices from the menu and we were not disappointed. Good portions that were great on the taste buds. Several waiters kept a check on us for each of our courses and drinks
3
Food was ok, went on a Friday night and as they have a special for $33++ for a bucket of 3 either cider or beer we ordered that.Waitress returned to say all the cider is sold out and only one type of beer left to choose from the 5/6 on offer. Not paying $15.50++ for a tiger beer so ordered 2 Cokes. They came in a glass full of ice and a little bit of Coke.Seriously $10++ for ONE glass of Coke
5
I love the breakfast selection here! You can get almost everything you need for breakfast, from local cuisine to western breakfast! The Cafe is spacious too
4
Nice ambience, good place to dine in...Staff provide excellent service........ The baby backribs was delicious to the bone! Its a must try! Service was superb and the ambience was so relaxing!! Ill be back for sure..
5
Had snacks here few times whilst staying at The Marriott Hotel. Food and service were excellent. Only negative with this place is that it seems to have become a 'pick up' place. The girls start hanging around from early afternoon and this goes until late at night. Perhaps it is a way for Crossroads Cafe to sell more alcohol but whatever the reason does not encourage families or couples to attend.
5
I was always looking forward with shida's service in crossroads cafe. My husband and I got very confused on the amex promotion till then shida had explained to us & we were happy about it. Not only I'm impressed with her service skills, but also with her great smile. I've never experienced a good service like this before. Will come back again with my husband. -jess & hubby 
3
I am a regular visitor to Singapore and the laksa served here was always the best on the island. However on this visit, I have to say that the changes made to the dish slightly disappointed me. There was only half a crayfish as opposed to a whole one and also instead of quails eggs they just put an ordinary egg in. Even though it was a big one it is still not the same. The gravy was still nice but these little changes have made a difference and I can no longer say that this is the best laksa on the island. The cocktails served here are still good so at least that's a small consolation
5
Located at a crossroad between Scotts and Orchard, the cafe/bar is buzzing with life. A great place to hangout and chill for some wine or beer. Try out their chicken satay. Grillled to perfection - juicy and tender. Great service from MJ and Birzan. Thank you.
5
In this cafe we had a good time, the waiter cha is really Nice we tasted the asian food and Was delicius. Highly recommended. It is in a very central part of the City where you can do many things on foot.
5
We have diner here more than one time a week (we live in the area).Staff is very friendly, welcome you back at the restaurant . Staff likes to work in this restaurant, always cheerful and making fun and jokes together. Specially MJ
3
Have had dinner here a few times as it is nice setting and good for larger groups. Food is good and well prepared, burger is excellent. Last time was a disappointment as we were informed that they only had one bottle of each wine on the menu which makes it complicated with 9 guests. A restaurant like this should have more wine on stock. Otherwise very good and can be recommended.
3
Good place in a central place the food is descent but nothing amazing, from the reviews I was expecting a bit better cuisine...pricing is a bit too high for the quality delivered
4
Although staying at a different hotel, we ended up eating 3 times at this restaurant because it has a good mix of local & other dishes. Service was very good & prices not outrageous
4
Cool and trendy. Perfect spot to chill on an expense account or just waiting for Brixx to open. Good spot if you're staying at the Marriott.
5
Crossroads at Marriott is a great place just to kick back and people watch whilst enjoying a varied menu and good wine list. Great both for families or just on your own to enjoy a cool drink out of the heat
2
I would get the food takeaway since it was tasty. Skip the smoky dining room with unhappy staff. We decided to eat here because it was next to our hotel. The place was busy and we waited a few mins for a table. There were no less than five staff that attended to our table - meaning we didn't know who our actual server was. Or maybe there isn't such a person? We ordered the Wagyu burger medium wth fries and the asparagus and pumpkin salad with Moroccan chicken. As well as iced tea to drink (at $11 a glass for flavored water). We were sat next to the smoking section which was completely full the entire visit (9pm weekday evening). The entire restaurant dining room was downwind of the smokers so regardless where you sat, you'd be subject to their second-hand smoke. The food tasted awesome - the burger was cooked perfectly tender and juicy and was even a double meat. The fries were crispy and hot. The salad was fresh and the chicken was not at all dry and really flavorful from the spices. And I think the amount of chicken was generous. The overall service was a best average. Never a thank you or a smile. Because we had so many different staff coming and going to our table, we got charged for an additional iced tea which we didn't order. They quickly removed the charge with minimal objection. At $11 a glass for ice tea (no alcohol or even lemon), no free refills here folks. Overall I would not go back to dine here. While the food was good, the environment and service are less than desirable. Not to mention the prices of the most basic drinks in the world being over priced. It's laughable! And I'm still kicking myself for paying such ridiculous drink prices (the food was priced right). There are hundreds of restaurants to choose from in this area and I'm sure there are better values for your money elsewhere. At best, I would get the food takeaway since it was tasty. Skip the smoky dining room with unhappy staff.
5
While staying in the Marriott Tang Plaza hotel, we ate twice in this restaurant.Set in a very busy corner, there was plenty to keep us interested while eating. The food was of a very high standard and the level of service was too. Hence the reason we ate there on two occasions.A very good atmosphere added to our enjoyment
4
A convenient restaurant that has a wonderful and varied seafood selection in the buffet for both lunch and dinner. The Cafe on Scotts road is a nice place to have a late night snack and coffee and watch the world go b
5
Me and my business partner dine in here. Dinner food was good. The version of their Nasi goreng was authentic. The restaurant has a good ambiance and a very relaxing place though Im too busy settling business with my partner. Any how, the whole dine in was good
3
Perfectly functional food - but forgettable. I went here because it was convenient to my hotel and they had Nasi Goreng on the menu: exactly what I felt like. But the meal was very average, and the restaurant itself had just above a work cafeteria feel to it. The wine was expensive even by Singapore standards. There was nothing wrong with the restaurant - it just defined average.
4
I visited on 11 Aug 16. I really like MJ's service. She knows her drinks well and able to excellently recommend/prepare both drinks for me. Thank you for making my visit a memorable one. :
5
Enjoyed my drink and meal on the terrace as I watched the evening rush past. Relaxing and great service. MJ thanks for the guidance on choosing local cuisin
5
Great food and service. MJ our waiter was wonderful... Recommended. Located in a beautiful place along Orchard Road.....see the world go by...
4
Arrived in Singapore near 11pm. Crossroads Cafe has an excellent open air seating. My server MJ was very nice and always checking to make sure I was satisfied. I had the fried rice and a cold draft beer. People watching was a bonus and large fans give a comfortable breeze.
5
Excellent service from staff member MJ to adjustments from standard menu. She was helpful to make suggestions and adjust to the customer
3
Location and setting is good, food is adequate but overall experience has not been beyond expectations. Personnel seemed not highly attentive, thus this rating
4
Great place to catch Pokemon! Good service of staff, MJ! Good food and great location! The staff even ask if my Son wanted berries on his ice-cream
3
A typical hotel bar pricing street level. Ok, if you don't want to go out, but nothing special. Nice staff.
4
When I have some leisure time for a late breakfast this is a place I enjoy going. The breakfast buffet is quite good but it's the views and people watching before it gets too hot that makes this a great place to go
5
Lovely to sit and watch the goings on while casually dining. Marriott Hotel Tang Plaza's restaurant is an ideal position
2
I cannot believe that in one evening, we can have not 1 but 2 visitors while having dinner n drinks!! Big ones by the way. All they can say is sorry. And that's it?? I wander what will the authorities say to that?Good thing the staff reacted fast n kill them.But I think somethings got to be done!Food is decent
4
I just visited this restaurant yesterday, I ordered Indonesian dish rice with egg and chicken with shrimps crackers , also we ordered resotto and grilled salad, the dishes were yummy and the service was excellent, the price was little bit more than everage, but in general it was very good restaurant with attractive location at orchard road.
5
Shes is very friendly staff she know how to entertent guest she got a very nice smile and very alert staff and very helpfull to her collegues the service excelent the caffe latte yummy and also the ice cream yummy crossroad is a nice place to relax i remember last time the food ROJAK i missed that food now no more and i hope that ROJAK will come back to the menu thnk
5
It's an excellent quaint place at the corner of the Orchard Road affiliated to the Marriott. Superb local cuisine as well as all out American cuisine to select from. Dined with my parents and had the best time. The location is convenient and at night, with all the lights Singapore has to offer, sipping on some good wine (yes, they have a very good collection), is all that you need after a hard day's work.Particularly good was the Mee Goreng-sumptious, gourmet, and worth every penny. Do give a visit if you're nearby.Also good were the Singapore laksa and the Char Hor Fun
3
Not too many faults with this place other than the price. It was our first experience of Singapore dining as we'd just arrived so maybe something we have to get used to, but $65 steaks and $21 beers is pretty rich in anyone's language! Rice & satays were very good as was the service. Sitting outside and watching the locals walk by also adds to the experience. Would have given full points except for price.
4
Came back here after it being my fave hangout 12years ago when I spent 2 months here .... I can honestly say it's still the best chicken rice in town for me. Nice spot for people watching in the hustle and bustle of orchard road shoppers - overhead fans give a nice breeze. Friendly service.
4
The buffet is very varied - everything from American style foods to local cuisine. The breakfast was definitely the best. Mixed it up each day so that it wasn't exactly the same but candidly, could be in almost any hotel anywhere in the world. I would plan to eat there if I wasn't feeling particularly adventuresome or if I was tired
5
Tonight visited Crossroads Cafe located at Level 1 of Marriott Hotel. Enjoyed a good coffee sessions there. There's indoor and outdoor seating. We had the outdoor one. Cosy ambience. Helpful waiters and waitresses.Ordered 2 cheese cakes and individual beverages. Smooth chamomile tea to calm the nerves.Truly enjoyed.
5
This place is the right place for watching the world goes byAnd i would like to specially mention MJ, who was my server she made me so comfortable like i'm dining in my house. I'll definitely come back here will fine MJ again
4
My friend and I came to the restaurant for a girls' night out. Our server, MJ, went out of her way to serve us and we were pleasantly surprised by her level of service, and would recommend this restaurant in a central location of Singapore to people watch and chill out in general. Good job
4
Its a good place to hang out and the best part is the availability of food from early hours to late night !!
5
Cross roads makes for a really good meeting place with a beer garden and great food served through the day till late / early hours of the night or morning. Lets meet at cross roads
5
Mannan and Mei are always great and make me feel like I'm home. There's no better place in Singapore to sit outside, enjoy the view, great food and drink selection.
5
its wonderful to bring your friends to crossroads cafe. Mannan did a great service to me and my friends. He recommends what to eat. Its good to know if the food has big portion of serving. Crossroads a place to bring your friend
5
We loved the Ceasar Salad and the Wagyu Burger. But most of all the friendly service from our host Manan.Thanks again & we will certainly be bac
5
Crossroads Cafe is always a favorite. Mannan provides excellent service and is very friendly and knowledgeable. My order is taken promptly and my drink is always refilled. Thanks Mannan for always making the extra effort to get to know and help your customers.
5
We stayed at the Marriott for 11 nights and had breakfast in this café for the entire duration of our stay.Staff was very polite and helpful. There is a wide variety of food to cover your taste buds but it comes with a price! It is S$50 per person
5
This was my second visit to the Crossroads cafe whilst on holiday with my cousins in Singapore and we were served by the same waiter Mannan , who not only recognised us he remembered our favourite cocktails the service we received was excellent. It was also my 1st time trying Nasi goreng and i have to say this dish was delicious. Will defiantly be back next time i visit Singapore x
4
This is part of the Marriott Hotel Tang Plaza, an exceptionally good hotel. Crossroads is outdoors but under cover of the building itself - perfect for people watching but it can be a bit warm. I popped in for a beer whilst walking down Orchard Road. A Tiger cost S$24 for a pint - it didn't stop me having 2 though as it was a nice atmosphere and a good venue to just chill.
5
We have been coming to the Crossroads Cafe at Singapore's Marriott hotel since I can remember. At least 20 years...and they are still fantastic. Great service, fantastic food for all ages, great cocktails. A must
5
Very good service from the staffs here especially justea very attentive to even small details and my visit was at 1am so even more impressed with the service
4
Pretty good food and service. Well worth a visit. Perhaps a little expensive but a great spot to watch the world go by
4
Broad selection of food that's reasonably well priced and good quality. Interesting by-the-glass wine selection also. Great place to grab a cool beer and simply watch the world go b
5
Located right on the corner of Scott's and Orchard road, a perfect place to relax with a cool drink after shopping....The staff are terrific...special mention to 'MJ' who looked after us and could not be more helpful. Here's a great tip...get here at 'happy hour' and get two Singapore Slings for around $20....a bargain! Not only that they are made properly too and taste wonderful :-)Did I mention that the food is terrific too
5
The great singaporesling! it was as good as the best cocktail i drink and very good service from the staffs. Thanks to MJ&justea i drink not alone
5
Staff serving me was Justea, enjoyed great customer relationship with her. Very well verse with the menu. Food was mediocre but Justea made the extra mile by understanding customers needs and attend to it accordingly with a extra dedicated touch.
4
Very pleasant , even though on sidewalk of main Orchard Road. Great outlook. Good atmosphere, slow with drinks, but food was excellent. Once we were there it was raining heavily, and the view was awesome! Traffic and people everywhere! Quite expensive for drinks .
5
Had a short but sweet experience at crossroads. Came in for a late dinner.. Really enjoyed the chicken breast with risotto! Service was sharp and super friendly. Nice music playing also. Highly recommended.
5
The food was exquisite. Everything was freshly prepared for us. The coffee was amazing and the hand made ice cream was to die for.
5
A tranquil oasis in the midst of the hustle and bustle of Orchard Road. Attentive staff who not only remember your last order but have a recommendation for you to try something new. Jovial as well which makes placing an order a pleasant conversation, not an arduous task.Great location for watching people go about their daily business.
5
A great Singapore sling 2 for 1 deal and friendly service. Nice to be recognised from my last visit in September. Food is good and worthy of a treat to yourself. A great spot to people watch too. My favourite hang out being a single traveller. I could and do, stay for hours!
3
Burger was good, Satay not too bad. However prices are high end for a bristo food. 17 SGD for half a pint of local beer...Ambiance is very nice thoug
5
Great please to sit and people watch, amazing bar service and foodThere used to be great live bands inside the Marriot it would be great to hear some live music in this location
5
The atmosphere in this place is buzzing. We only had drinks here but it was a great place to stop and watch the world go by
4
Found the food very nice and great to see a decent craft beer list to enjoy with meal. Even had a special on which was even better.
5
Good location, good food, attentive and helpful staff. We've been to many restaurants in our 7 days trip, this is where we find best service
5
A cute waitress named MJ made me a Manhattan Soul. I'd say it tasted so much better than the first Manhattan Soul I had here a couple weeks ago. Moreover, she's very approachable and easy going. Look for MJ if you guys like to have a good cocktail while sitting here and looking at the passer by. Interesting spot! I hope i can she is still here on my next visit.
4
My husband and I both had the waygu burger -- it was as good as the best burger we get in the States.
5
Mathan and mj in crossroad cafe marriot singapore they do there job well exellent staff in crossroad very friendly and nice people they know how to handle there guest booth of you MATHAN AND MJ all the best you do job well even busy but they still smile your the best booth of you thnk you for the best you serve me when i visit marriot crossroad cafe singapor
4
Having already eaten, but not had dessert, we decided to stop here for a drink and a bit of 'people watching'. The ladies were very tempted by the look of the desserts so ended up sampling them and were not disappointed. We sat, watched the world go by and just relaxed on our last night in Singapore. A great place to chill
5
Probably the best location for a drink in Singapore. They run special drink promotions most afternoons and the weekend. Service is good and they do have a smoking area if you are a smoker.
5
I visited here 3days ago with my friend having finger food&cocktail, every food, cocktail were so lovely..And the server MJ was really attentive, knowledgable, friendly she is just AWESOME!!she recommended cocktails for us, she knows everything inside of cocktails and food also!!If you don't know about food or drinks, looking for MJ, she will help you a lotI'll definitely come here again, highly recommend:
5
I've visited Crossroad last Saturday with my friend to enjoy the cocktail promotion.It is the best place to chill out with my friends and to drink.All the staff were so kind and expected my needs at all times.Especially I would like to mention whose name is MJ, because she was very attentive and always has smile on her face even if it was very busy to deal with the guest.It was one of the best bar I've ever been.I'll definitely come back again :
5
We noticed the "Buy one, get one free" sign as we were walking by so we had to go in. We were immediately greeted by Mannan who quickly sat us and told us about his favorite drink (which I ended up getting). Mannan came back a few times to check in with my husband and me. He did a great job of having small talk with us while still maintaining his tables. As a Marriott rewards member we actually regretted staying at Marina Bay Sands, especially after our experience with Mannan. He was wonderful and can't wait to go back and seek him out
5
We have been passed this cafe many times and always thought it would be nice to go in. Unfortunately we have always been a using to be somewhere else. This, therefore was our first visit and we were not disappointed.We ordered drinks to start with - pint of Tiger and a half pint of Guinness. We then turned our attention to the food. We both ordered the Marriott Burger - medium. It came with a chunky half of gherkin, a pot of fries and mustard on the side. The burger itself was succulent and topped with plenty of cheese. The best burger we have had in a while. The food we saw going towards other tables looked yummy too. The staff were friendly and attentive. We will probably go there again on our next visit to Singapore
3
If you are on a budget then $20 for a 500ml beer is probably not to for you. It was painful for me. Food equally overpriced but I guess that is Singapore.Drink selection extensive as is food menu. Service was good but as I say very expensive
5
5 star, will come back definately. When my girlfriend and me come back after weeks without visiting the place, Mannan remembers our favourit drinks and keeps two seats ready at the great smoking table. Kitchen, drinks and atmosphare are fantastic. I feel warmly welcome here
5
The staff here (Mannan in particular) was amazing! It was a rainy day and we needed a place to wait it out & he made us feel right at home. Affordable food, great staff, and awesome location :
5
Had a very short visit to Singapore.. Ended up popping in here every evening... The staff are very friendly, chatty and helpful, the food is delicious and i pretty much had one of the best vegetable fried rices ever! Loved the happy hour cocktail selection. Worth a visit
4
Right at the crossroad of Orchard and Scott Road Free wifi available A smoking counter for about 10 people Happy hours drink at 9.90 each mons to thurs 3-6 pm Snacks food and burger are served Limited choice of menu lunch and dinner Great place to kill time and relax
5
I came up for a friend's get together and really enjoyed the hospitality given by the Cross Roads team especially Bartender Venki, and rest of the staffs like Mannan,Mathan,Nathan,Brian,Fiona,MJ and Mai. My girlfriend had Mojito and came to know about the Cocktail promotion of 1+1 and really impressed about the promotion. Food was nice and the restaurant ambience was good on facing the ION Orchard with good music. I have visited lot of bars and your's was open one enjoying the locality of trendy Orchard. Bartender was quick and very friendly. And Mathan was giving us good knowledge about the wine selection because it was our first wine experience. Keep it up guys...Cheers!!!
5
Awesome evening at mariott with an excellent mocktail by venky, a great fun filled serving from Brian,mathan,mannan,mei which leads me to frequent visits, Would say this as best hangout ever
5
Had a great dinner in marriott, I would like to thank the staffs for providing execellent service.I had the pleasure of meeting guys like(Venkat ,Brian,Mannan,mathan,Mei)they r really awsome!!! and indeed professional on their work the kind of quality they serve every time, makes us to come back here frequently.All I can say is Good food Good drink Good friend Good time
5
The breakfasts were superb with great array of international cuisine. The price was moderate but quality was high
4
Located right on the corner of Scotts and Orchard Road. This casual cafe offers delicious finger foods, and delicious cocktails. During our week long trip in Singapore, this was our meeting place for a drink before dinner. Good for people watching, and a nice place to cool off during hot singapore weather.
4
Situated on the corner of Scott's and Orchard the Crossroads cafe is part of the Marriott Tang Plaza hotel hence the expensive prices.Service for breakfast in fairness was top notch and the food quality matched it. Busy and great place to wind away some leisure time people watching
1
Marriott's Burger tasted worse than a bad fast food burger (extremely overcooked) and noodles tasted like it had no seasoning. On top of the badly prepared food the waiter got my order wrong - would not change the bill that he made an error on. Will never ever ever come here again - shame to get such a service at Marriot
2
First of all, the service was not Good, the soup and the burger came within minutes of eachother after a loooong wait, the kids burger was dry and hard and not tasty, the lambchops were delicious, extraordinary, the burger was ok, so overall not a Good experience, it is only outside too, inside there is a different nice looking bufet. It was pricey too as a burger costs about 24 dollars
5
I have stayed at the Marriott at tang plaza many times, and I am always happy at the crossroads cafe. I had the pleasure of meeting mannan. He took care of me every day. He is literally the best server I have ever had. He remembered my name after meeting and he never forgot it. He also provided some of the best service I have ever experienced. I highly recommend this restaurant, and more importantly I recommend mannan. Give him a raise and a promotion!
5
Special thanks to Krishnan for great service with a smile and for taking special care of the kids.The special attention not only to the fantastic choice of food avaiable from Chef Daniel but also on going the extra mile on looking after his guest
5
Stopped here for a spot of breakfast we both had a round of toast and the ham/cheese omelette which was a decent size we left stuffed was very yummy!
5
Mannan is a wonderful host and he will make sure you have the most comfortable time at Crossroads. Ask for Mannan when you arrive!
5
It was my first time to visit here. We had a couple of drinks and some light bites! All the foods and drinks that they served to us was magnificent! I wanna highlighted the very awesome service served by the two lovely MANNAN and KENT that they rendered to us during our visit. We will definitely come back here again not just for drinks but the smoothly service itself, especially to kent and mannan! Fantastic service ... we'll see you again guys!!
5
The location of the cafe is brilliant. The menu is well designed serving wide verity of food. I had fettuccini and a banana split and it was delicious. Best shopping break one can have in this area.
2
There's a clue in the title. It seems the once fantastic Crossroads Cafe is suffering from a severe case of mediocrity and terminal decline. The once imaginative and diverse menu, has now been replaced by a derivative and formulaic one. Where once there was impeccable and attentive service there is now apathy and substandard service. In the end for S$76 for 2 drinks and one main course, I'd expect something a little better than what I received last night. It's a pity, like most reviewers note, it is a great place to hang out and watch the world go by. But for substantially less money and much better service I can do the same at McDonalds across the street!
5
we had a few meals here with the family. the setting is relaxed although very busy at times being on a busy junction. the food, especially the light meals were really tasty (bruschettas mainly
5
This outdoor cafe is affiliated with the Marriott hotel, so you can charge your meal or drinks to your room. This is a great place to sit and watch the bustling city from a shady breezy spot while sipping something cool. Friendly and prompt service, good food, and a lively atmosphere
5
Dear Sir Marriott i would like to convey my thanks to you for having such lovely staffs who were very wonderful in their services. The first impression is the best of your staffs as this was the first time for us to patronise. But now we already come thrice every night because of your staffs caring services.Mr.Mannan, Mr. Nathan, Mr.Mathan, Mr.Shahul & Mr.Kent very excellent and professional & efficient in their services rendered. They are assest to the company with excellent core values. Thanks and best regards and a very happy new year ahead. From yours Mr & Mrs kalimuthu & Jenagur
5
Another very pleasant evening withe the usual professional and very friendly service from the wonderful staff ! A really good place to relax, unwind and watch the world go by, food and service perfect as usual. Would like to say a special thanks to Mannan, Stephanie, Arin and the great management at Marriott ! We will see you again very soon 
5
This was a great spot. Mannan was an excellent host. He was attentive, and always willing to go the extra mile to help me feel at home. I am thankful for him, and the rest of the wonderful staff for always being friendly and catering to our every need.
5
exceptional personality from Mr. Mannan who made me very comfortable and friendly and warm service.. No question about coming back here.

5
Drinks, service and food ver good. We keep coming back.

Chicken Caesar salad was phenomenal. Mannan was excellent. Always enjoy Crossroads while in Singapore. Mannan always recognizes me and addresses me by name. Great choice

This evening change our impression on cross road @ Marriott ... Manna , you change my mind of skipping this place tonight! Well done! We will be back... Only evenings bcos you are there!!!
5
Great bar excellent staff and great beer. M.J. is an awesome bar tender shes the best in Singapore. I will always come back her
5
Excellent service as always !!! I have been coming here for years and it is always super good . The staff are really fantastic and are very professional indeed. I would especially like to mention Mannan, MJ, Stephanie and Mei. Thank you all for looking after us so well every time.
5
Really had a great time at crossroad cafe.. Really well serviced by Manan who really took great care of us and even offered us a complimentary drink... Makes us come bck to this place again and agai
5
Coming to Singapore, infrequently, always have to take on an evening at Crossroads. Great corner location to watch the world go by. Food and drink is great and super impressed with Server Mannan! Always remembers me and makes this place feel like I'm back home.
5
I was here for having dinner with my friendI met the best server name is MJI was really touched by her services and kindness also.And the food was really delicious and the cocktail 1 for 1 promotion was awesome!!If i come to singapore again, crossroad will be the first place that i'll go.Thanks for good memor

I have been visiting the Crossroads Cafe at the Marriott since 1997. It is a great place to sit and watch the world go by! My favourite time is between 7.00 and 8.00pm as the sun sets and Orchard Road lights up. The cafe offers a wide selection of food and drinks and caters to most tastes. The staff are friendly and welcoming, from manager David who has been there since 2000 to the current team including: Mannan, Mei, Fiona, Fenny, Suji, Mj, Mathon, Krishnan, Stephanie, Nicole, Shahul, Nathan, Brian ,Venky and Samy apologies to those I missed. Make sure you don't miss the Crossroads Cafe.

Good services from staff name Arin, Should give some WOW award to her! ;) would come back again for ur awesome carbonara ;)
4
Service was good. The server; Mannan was proactive, initiative & friendly with his service. The food came just in time for us and we enjoyed our time together. If there were more staff on duty, I think service for everyone could be more attentive. And I suggest more fans for the outdoors as well. Overall our experience at crossroads cafe was excellent
5
The food here is very good . The staff Mannan and Brian very attentive and friendly. I and husband always come here for buffet dinner. Love the food
5
I love this restaurant.. Enjoy it here for a drink with friend.. Mannan service is Super good and friendly. Will definitely come back for happy hour and more
3
Went with 2 friends for couple of drunks. The cocktail us average but location is really good. Also it was on special deal of buy one get one free.. Even after 12:00!!Service is great but mixed...Our server Mannan was great but unfortunately one of server when I asked her for the wash room, she was not so friendly... In fact a nit rude.. Overall we has a great time
5
the staff here are extremely very good really took care of us ,my wife have a very special diet they really put extra effort on follow ups ,most of the places we go most of them either refuse us on the dietary food or just dont care however a manager by the name of sam and a waiter mathan really there to take care of our needs,overall our dinning experience was good my wife is very happy,we decided on our next visit to singapore will definitely stay in this hotel. excellent!, parfait
5
Very attentive service from Mannan. Food quality and preparation is very good. Menu diversity offers something for everyone. Nice spot for people watching.
5
Staff very friendly even they are busy they still smile brian.airen.nicole.mj.mannan.mathan.vengky.suji.alwie.they are very exellent staff
4
This semi-outdoor cafe is bugs sheltered by the overhanging building, and huge overhead fans keep the air moving and bugs at bay. Our party had a salad, a BLT, and a steak sandwich and all were very good. Not inexpensive, but you probably knew that, given the location at the Tang Plaza Marriott on the corner of Orchard and Scotts, but good service and high quality foods
5
Wonderful breakfast buffet. Quality food and fantastic selection & variety all fresh with a mixture of western and Asian. But best of all are the staff especially the lovely Stephanie who always has a welcome smile and looks after us. Great value, great location. I can't reccomend enough x
5
this place nice n wonderfull
mJ friendly n great service n food n drink all best never i have
,location in strategic shopp mall n hotel arround
5
MJ - looked after us very well - and also helped us with wifi connection - an excellent staff member
5
Great atmosphere.Located right in the main drag.Attached to the Singapore Marriott Hotel.Staff are the best you would find at any restaurant.Friendly and ready to attend your needs.
Very clean as everything in Singapore is.
I thoroughly recommend this restaurant.
This is the 3rd visit there
5
Great people watching in the heart of Orchard Road shopping district. The staff really does a nice job of special requests. The Guinness is great and the atmosphere is great. Mannon is always great!
4
Great venue to be at... Right at the heart & soul of Orchard Rd, connected with SIN Marriott HTL... Good selection of food & service... Outdoor seating as well as indoors...
4
Staying at Marriott Tang Plaza. Had before and after dinner drink at Crossroads. Service perfect, Venky especially attentive. Cold Tiger beers, bustling open bar and Marriott hospitality...very nice experience
5
The title of this review expresses my experience. Service is good. but might be a bit more attentive. Drinks are well made but not inexpensive. Draught Tiger Beer may be the best deal. Bar snacks and a menu for the adjoining Marriott Cafe are available, but I did not utilize them.
4
As other reviewers have noted, you can't beat the location. My husband ordered Hokkien Mee (noodle) and some kind of iced tea. I got a cocktail, persian peach, I think. My drink is pretty good. But the noodle dish is SO GOOD! We were pleasantly surprised. Yup, the food was expensive, but you've got great location. Service was efficient and hospitable. I recommend this place. Oh, and the place was quite full even on Thursday night
5
I've been visiting Singapore during stop overs for the past 15 years and always have at least one meal at Crossroads Cafe. The food is always good, albeit more expensive than the food courts close by, but then you are paying for the location. You can stop and have a drink and watch the world go by, which is always interesting on Orchard Road. The Beef Ho Fun is always enjoyable
3
Situated outside the Marriott on the corner of Scotts & Orchard Roads, this can be a fun place to hang out and watch folks walk by. It seems to be a good meeting place or for folks in the Marriott Hotel to just chill out and have a beer and a few snacks. Most folk seem to chose the bar snack, (three types of Nachos etc) and beer or wine. However, at $25sing per pint, the cost soon mounts up which is why i've scored it just average.
5
Nice place and nice Staff like Mannan, he is very nice and accommodating staff👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻.Pls check this place I'm absolutely sure guys you will like it!
5
Fenny is the best! Awesome Service, great smile and very helpful. Rockstar! Includes free Hotdogs 5:30pm-6:30pm.

Disappointing cocktails for the price. They turned on a repeat of a rugby game half way through the evening...
5
I am a firmly believer that people usually take the time to complain when things or situations don't go as expected, but we never take the time to compliment or say thank you for an outstanding serviceThanks to all the staff at the crossroad cafe. They have been extremely nice and understanding. They were even rushing the chef to cook my breakfast quicker the day I felt asleep, fixing my to go breakfasts, etc and being very professionalSpecial thanks to Mannon for making me and all our group feel special and important by remembering our names and providing us the best recommendation with Great attitude, being humble, knowledgeable and great recommendations. He became our Singaporean great friend !Thanks Mannon for making us feel like we are treated better than at home .I wish I can post your pic so people would know whom to ask for next time they visit the crossroads cafe.See you in a few weeks my friend
5
I got a great staff who remembers us really well. His name is Mannan and he is fabulous. He attentive, caring and helpful always. I don't even need to tell him what I want for drinks and he knew it. 5 stars for him! Keep it up Mannan
1
please don't waste your time attending this establishment.Located at the crossroads of terrible service and extortionate pricing. If you want to feel financially raped then this is the place for you. The staff don't care, the management care even less and you could have more fun if your went into the street and threw your money up in the air, to watch greedy Singaporeans fight over it. The only thing worse than this place in Singapore, is the taxi drivers who are rude discourteous and typically struggle to find their genitals in their underpants
5
We have to thank Mr. Mannan, Ms. Arin, Mr. Mathan and the rest of the staff for being the best of the bar attends. We like you guys. Five years down the line and we want more and more from this restaurant. Good service,good food and we have to make a greetings from the bar and and the kitchen. See you soon. We will be back in February, how about the welcome back Champagne and the Shiraz. Thank You for everything ! We'll coming back 
5
Had a great time with friends when we went for a dinner. The bar menu was simple and the food was tasty. Located perfectly in Orchard and has the best ambiance appropriate for an open bar. Drinks menu offers a wide variety of liquors and cocktails. The staff were extremely helpful and polite. Special mention for Mr. Venkat, the bartender who was very friendly and served us cocktails quickly, not letting us wait for the next drink. Looking forward to visiting again with my friends and I would recommend this place to my friends and family
5
This is my first time for Marriott in Singapore. I am from India, so I came with my Singapore friends, and enjoyed the drinks menu. I like to Thank Mr.Sagul, Manager. Who gave warm welcome to us and clarifies the menu doubts. Totally We enjoyed the environment of the open bar
5
I have to thank Mr.Venkatesh for wonderfull bar attender.. Serve a timing and quality drinks for me and our group memebers. I came on sunday, I know it is damn busy for that day, but the staff did a execellent hospitality. It induce us to come again. Thanks, Guha
4
Overall food is good. Especially e dessert. Good chocolate n tiramisu cake. Awesome.
However e sushi roll i ate, the rice is not fully cooked. 😳
5
Handy within the hotel.Good variety.The only downer is the taxes 7%gst and 10% service fee.staff very friendly and efficient worth theextra money paid
5
Today I had a great margarita. Being Mexican I am really exigent and picky about margaritas
This one is perfect. Besides you buy one and get the second one free!!!!
5
Baby rib was very delicious. I also want to try another ribs. One Korean staff suzy is friendly and so sweet!!! nice thank you.
4
Located on the corner of Scott's road and Orchard road this open air cafe offers anything from light meals to full steaks etc... We went at 10.30pm when most were closing. This was open and busy. Quick service, good food...perfect street side dining. Will be bac
3
Had a late lunch here withe excellent chicken satay and chilled Tiger Beer. Nice buzzing atmosphere
1
The place looks ok but actually is incredibly overpriced $35 for a glass of house white and they totally forgot the food order.To their credit the cost of glass wine was refunded with the error but overall very poor experience. Very over priced and poor service
4
Craving some BBQ pork ribs so decided to come here to try. Ribs were very tender and flavorsome. Given the heat we decided to eat inside rather that outdoors by the busy walk way. Overall very good and had some ice cream to top it off. Will be back
5
Really was a great day ever.... Celebrating my husband birthday at here with our two kids. Everything is so good. The Food, the atmosphere..... And the servings very nice. And at last.... We got free one slice of strawberry cheesecake so yummy. The lamb chop.... Should try very delicious. Ribs also not bad either
3
Greatest place to stake a lookout in Orchard is here, as all the human traffic comes by here! You have the tourists, the study mamas with their kids, the large family plowing through the crowds, the teens swearing and laughing, and the list goes on. The prices here are nuts, as this is connected to the hotel and as such has prices to match. Another thing to consider is that this is outdoors and noisy. Enjoy a more peaceful atmosphere elsewhere but if you are here to watch the world go by, you came to the right place
5
The staff are simply amazing !!! Samy very professional and knowledgeable. I hope that they will promote him and give him a raise! also MJ makes a very beautiful cappuchino! Too nice to consume great work. Salute to Marriott staff.
5
excellent service,gud food n drinks.., with great view n great staff...thanks to mannan, venkey, nathan, mathan, nicole, ronaldo, edward, brian, annisa and d whole crossroad team that make my dining experience a gud one.😊
5
Mannan, one of the bartenders is really accommodating and very nice. He made us great drinks and took us in even tho we were really last minute. Good service
4
Mannan did an excellent job of making my dinner experience wonderful. Ask for him when you visit. In the Marriott Tang Plaza!
5
The mood thanks to the delicious food and friendly staff in a nice restaurant of the trip was good, Thank you MJ
4
This place very nice!
Clean and most of all provided me perfect service.
Suzy. She is very kind and have a glorious smile!!
Thanks for good memories and service.
5
I am not the type of person writing such reviews whether the place was good or bad.But this place, in the center of Orchard, has everything what I need! free wifi, good drinks and foods, lovely atmosphere, always encounter new people, smoking available at one long table in the corner of the cafe, and of course, the great staffs! especially MJ, the waitress, made the cafe even lovelier~! thank you
5
I've been coming to the outdoor bar and the service and food has always been very good, but MJ has raise the bar here. Very friendly, professional and it was as if we were friends for a long time. MJ is a keeper and I will definitely come here again
4
The crossroads cafe is a good place to have a drink late in the evening, watching people pass by, exchanging ideas and lively discussions.The service is really good, I felt very much taken care of.There are several promotions so you can even make a good bargain as compared to other Singapore locations. Food was also very good, esp. the Tom Yam Gung soup. -Manan, thank you very much for the good service
5
Great place!I highly recommend you to stop by and heck this place outAsk for Mannon! He will give you the best food and drinks suggestions ! I have had the best Caesar Salad ever and tried so many new dishes every day !Great place! Delicious food! Amazing location ! Royal service and unforgettable shopping and business place... What else can you ask for 
5
Merriott hotel is near by orchard road.so, easy to shopping and good place.
crossroads cafe is rest cafe that doing shopping.
food was very good and service was nice.
Staff Suzy was kind to me,and interest to our family.she's smiling face is cute.
5
People is very kindly and food is delicious, location is good
Especially thanks to Mj & Suji
4
Convenient and casual place to grab lunch or dinner. Prices are not too expensive and selection is quite generous. Both local cuisine and western one.
5
Miss MJ was very helpful, supportive and friendly. Restaurant is really great, clean with good location and sure will come again.
5
It was late Sunday night. I had some snacks and wine in crossroads cafe. One of the staff named suzy. service was awesome. I really appreciate. Thank you so much.
3
Food and service was great, but S$20.90++ for a pint of tiger beer does seem a little excessive, even by Singapore standards.
4
There's nothing showy about eating here. It is simple food adequately priced for Singapore! That being said the ingredients were excellent and food was lovely. Highly recommend the cheese and desserts. Waiters MJ, Venky, Mannan and the team were lovely excellent, polite and genuinely very helpful answering our non food related tourist questions which is rare in this town usually they want your money and you to go. They were very attentive. We had a lovely time here drinking the peach dream cocktails
5
I visited Marriot last saturday and i had a great experience with MJ and SuzyThey warm welcomed me when i arrived, so that i could feel very comfortable.Especially, i want to mention regarding drink which was made by MJ I've drank Margarita and it was fantastic Eventhough she works at bar alone, she was willing to make amazing drink :)Thanks for them to make me feel like staying at home and nice drink :)
5
I had visited just a few days ago and caught up with Mr Mannan, the staff who serves there. I have been visiting often in the past and must say that Mr. Mannan is an excellent professional service professional. I would strongly recommend whoever visits ask for him . He is extremely courteous and humble and will ensure that you order the right thing and make sure it comes on time and to your taste . Wish we could find a Mannan in every restaurant, just adds to the overall comfort value.
5
We had our last night in this restaurant and enjoyed it so much. We ordered off the Al la carte menu as the buffet menu was expensive and we wouldn’t of eaten that much to cover the cost. The dishes are very traditional and the atmosphere is more business attire I would say but it was still lovely.Service was good. We sat inside the restaurant – opted for air con and also the décor was nicer than outside
5
I like coffe Crossroads Cafe and food so yummy . I can remember Emily . She so good . I will come back again .
5
Crossroads cafe foods are really nice. I like it. and I can remember one of the staffs. The name is Suji. She's so kind!!!! Thanks Suji.
5
The service by the Marriott staff, specifically Suji was outstanding. Suji is very kind and her smile is very beautiful. The food and beverages and atmosphere were delightful and I hope to stay again at this wonderful establishment. Really good experience for me. Thanks.
5
Great breakfast buffet....hard to beat it anywhere. The hotel also has a lunch and dinner buffet that is first class.
5
We have had a wonderful time at the Crossroads cafe. specially Mannan who served us was very helpful and considerate of our every need. Excellent service. delicious food.
5
Had a enjoyable relaxing drink and food at the crossroads cafe watching the world go by. Served by Mannan who made me feel most welcome and comfortable.
5
The Chili Crab Omelet is great. Gluten free bread and other selections available. Large selection of breakfast choices. Eggs and soup to order. Lots of fresh tropical fruit.
5
Great outdoor spot to work and people watch, and the cappuccinos and local food are pretty good too. The ceiling fans make sure it doesn't get too hot even on Singapore's hottest day. Key to the experience, though, is Mannan. Ask for him to be your waiter - he is friendly, meticulous, and never lets your water glass get empty. He's super experienced and is well into his second decade working there. Every couple years I go through a phase when I go to Crossroads at least once a week to work or meet up with friends. This past time Mannan recognized me and took down my number to have their management office sign me up for their membership program (which is totally worth it for someone who goes as often as me.) When their management officer called he told me that the program was usually open for only a couple months a year, but Mannan had called him and insisted that he open a membership for me because I was a loyal customer. What thoughtful, well-rounded service!!! Thanks Mannan
5
After a long and warm working day, the excellent place to sit down under the cooling fans, just watching the Singapore life passing by. As I am a regular guest they know my preferences and Amman one of the friendly waiters makes you feel a little like coming home when you are traveling alone
5
First time at this place and it was fantastic! Our waitstaff Mr Mannan was amazing! Excellent customer service and great conversationalist. Cocktail special deals were great and he took exceptional care of us, even though the place was busy. Thank you buddy, we'll be back again for sure!
4
Sitting here for the last couple of days. Very good service! Awesome service from my waiter (Mannan) Good food and good beer!
5
My favourite hangout where you can sit with your drink, a book, some great good and equally great service and watch the vibrancy of Singapore surround and pass you by from all directions .. Fascinating and relaxing!
Must mention also very attentive service by Mannan.
5
Every single thing was perfect - the food, the ambiance, and most especially the service by our wonderful waiter Mannan. I cannot recommend highly enough.
4
Great place to eat lunch and enjoy a cold drink during a long day of walking around Orchard Road. The food has been great every time, and a cold weissbier takes the heat away. The kobe beef burger is amazing.
5
The service by the Marriott staff, specifically Mannan was outstanding. The food and beverages and atmosphere were delightful and I hope to stay again at this wonderful establishment.
1
Just awful. Awful. Awful... Terrible service, terrible food, flies in the cocktails... Shocking. Great for people watching if that's your hobby
1
Drinks are pretty good, and at the moment the cocktails are 1 for 1 (although you'll have to specifically ask for the offer, as I did, and also point out to them that the drink you just ordered is indeed classed as a cocktail!!)But the food and service were both extremely disappointing. Ordered a steak sandwich... Nice presentation, arrived quickly, but cold and clearly not cooked fresh. Told the staff, who took it away, and then brought the SAME one back (with one bite out of it), and amazingly, still only luke warm.I drank my cocktails, and left the steak... The staff removed my virtually untouched sandwich and didn't bat an eyelid... Classy!So in conclusion - come here if you fancy a cheapish cocktail and want to watch the people (and prostitutes) go by. But don't stay for the food..
5
As a business man who travels weekly, my decisions as to where to eat, drink, etc. are largely based on the service I receive at a given establishments. Not only does Crossroads Cafe have excellent food their service staff go above and beyond their required duties and expectations. Mannan in particular exemplifies this. Some 6-8 weeks after my first visit he not only remembered that he had waited on me before he also remebered that I had a deep appreciation for local food and, again, made a excellent meal recomendation
2
Perhaps the title of my review pokes a little at a previous reviewer, but let me explain. I live in Singapore at the moment, and upon walking past Crossroads Cafe one morning I noticed a sign offering a discounted breakfast buffet for guests who were willing to sit outside. S$32++ was the price - still not cheap but better than the S$50++ it would have cost by sitting inside. Let me start with the positive. The selection is absolutely amazing. If you can't find anything to eat, then we need to have a different discussion. Their cappuccinos are from Illy - their beans are of a high standard and drinking coffee becomes an instant pleasure. As for the issues. Everything has sugar in it and is made extra sweet (roti prata, yoghurt, bircher mÃ¼sli, etc.) - aspartame-laced, perhaps. Not the best for you or your body. In addition, they use genetically modified (GM) oils to cook their dishes. When their omelette Chef started taking the canola oil can to spray on my eggs, I almost lost it. I tend to (try and) reeducate people on the risks of these GM foods, yet the Chef tried to convince me that it was indeed healthy (does that mean everything is booked with Canola Oil??). The scenario turned somewhat comical when the caucasian Chef - overhearing our conversation - sprinted over to the station and immediately confirmed that the dish could of course be made just as I requested. So I am happy to report that they understand the risks but I guess in order to maximize their contribution margins and minimize food cost, they look the other way. If you don't care for your health for at least one day a week, eat here!
5
I had the pleasure of visiting here for 3 days in a row!!! Was served by Mannan! He must be the most friendliest and accommodating server ever ! i can definitely say I came back not just for the long Island but also for the friendly face! Thanks! A very happy tourist I am
4
The Crossroads Cafe is a great place to sit and have a drink and watch Singapore pass you by on Orchard road. Mannan and rest of the staff are friendly and always remember you when you return.
5
Excellent quality food and service, specially Mannan my server, very friendly, professional and helpful. I strongly recommend a visit
5
I enjoy the cafe for over 10 years coming back. Staff in general are very attentative to customers, especially Manaman.
Keep up the great job.
4
I love this place and go there every time I am in Singapore....which would be 40-50 times over the years. Just a great happy corner spot alfresco below the Marriott Hotel with good basic food and also some nice Asian compilations. Staff are just very trained and happy to look after 'whoever' enters the restaurant. My whole family have dined here...always for lunch and we all talk about it later. My son's who are also ravellers have been there now on their own and of course we now have photos with them sitting there during their travels. Its great.Expensive TEA...can never get over tht one. We like to drink English Breakfast tea but at SG$9.50 for a cup (not a pot) it is just not worth it. This has been the same for years. Please change this Crossroads...its only water and a tea bag. Still...we love it and will always come back. We have not experienced the buffet inside but my kids have...who are all in the 20's now. This is also meant to be amazing and looks amazing
4
As mentioned many times here, this is a wonderful location to sit on a busy corner and people watch - and even more fun when it's raining heavily and you are feeling perfectly content. Had breakfast here a couple of times when staying at the Marriott and then invented excuses to go back for another sit and watch. Food, drinks and staff good as well..
5
We were staying in the Marriott but even if we weren't we would have sat here with a cocktail and a glass or two nibbling away and watching the world go by. Good, attentive but not in-your-face service, great for watching the world go by We were here for breakfast (as ticked below) but also for lunch and dinner
5
If you want an excellent welcome to Singapore, make sure to stop by Crossroads. Ask for Mannin. It's a great place for people-watching. Service is on point. Whether it's drinks or noshing, Crossroads has it all. A bit pricey, but well worth stopping by. Central location is convenient to all the shops
5
I really want to take advantage of last visit in Crossroads Cafe in Singapore to highlight the wonderful service provide by Mannan. He is not only a very professional waiter focus in every single detail but also a really good person making your lunch/dinner even more fantastic,M
5
I'm a regular at the Marriott hotel (crossroads cafe ) in Singapore .. Absolutely love the environment and the staff, sitting on the corner of Scott's road and orchard is the perfect in town spot to relax and watch the world go by.. I always have a great time and never have to wait nor ever had the need to complain about anything.. Service comes with a courteous smile and professional manner every visit.. Our favourite server/ barman, Mannan always has our order before We hit the seat and that proves that he is formost professional at making the customer happy, excellent service every time and his diligence for the customer is above expectations every time.. Whether it's for a coffee or drinks, crossroads has Good vibes, great food, Central location makes the Marriott a must when in Singapore... Lee Campbel
5
The team at the Marriot are brilliant. Especially look out for the great support from Mannan. He is great and really made the time in the cafe so enjoyable.The food options are good and the location on Orchard Road brings the city into the cafe
5
We love to have our breakfast here, enjoying some coffee while watching everyone go to work.....so relaxing !
4
Located at the crossroads of Orchard Road, bang smack in the middle of SIngapore. Good food and outdoor seating. Drinks are expensive - although this is not uncommon in Singapore.
5
I had a meal with my friends here during dinner.I enjoyed the salmon nicoise to the fullest. Compliments to the chefs ! And also we got a lovely service from Anthony and Yazid.
5
Had dinner with my family here. A wonderful experience and a lovely service by the staffs. My family and I enjoyed the food to the max. The wagyu burger was just top notch ! Will definitely come back here again ! :)
5
Venky is possibly the best bartender ever. Spending my entire life in the business I have rarely seen a more switched on guest focused bartender EVER! Always looking up to welcome the next guest and a smile that never leaves. I ended up at the bar after a very long day at which time I was offered a drink and a smile. Every guest felt right at home and welcome whether you were American, Asian or other, very impressed. So if you ever visit Marriott Singapore do yourself a favor and sit with one of the best!!
5
The Singapore Slings are perfectly made here and you get two for the price of one in Happy Hour! The Caesar salad here is alway good and you have the option of adding delicious grilled prawns.The hamburgers are good too! It's a fun place to sit and watch the world go by whilst taking a break from the shopping at Ion Orchard shopping mall opposite the Marriott. Crossroads is a regular spot for us whenever in Singapore
4
Had dinner with a friend from oversea and she wanted Italian food so came to this cafe since it's next to her hotel (Grand Hyatt). I had mushroom soup and pomodoro. Both are too salty to my preference. However, I like the most is the bread which was served with the soup. It's so tasty, soft in inside but crunch at the outside. The texture is just nice and perfecto! Generally I feel it's too expensive. It costs us about S$50/pax for a soup + pasta + soft drink. Probably it's because the cafe belongs to Marriott Hotel (5 stars)
5
My husband and I stopped off from shopping to have a drink here and ended up staying for a meal. The staff were very friendly with prompt service. The seating and tables were clean and comfortable and it's great for watching the world go by!! They have a 2 for 1 deal on cocktails and also wine promotions. We started off our meal with a snack of goat cheese stuffed prunes wrapped in bacon... Divine! Then I ordered the sea bass and my husband had the wagyu burger with truffle fries . Both dishes were lovely and I look forward to coming back and trying out more from the menu! As we were treating ourselves we ordered the cheesecake to share! Delicious! I highly recommend here for lunch/dinner or just drinks. Great place!
3
We go here every time we are in Singapore. It is always an expensive place to go and that hasn't changed. Service needs improving too
3
Cafe is in a good location.we were seated quickly and the service was okay.expensive but in the heart of a city what can you expect.i had the Kir Royale and got a second one free.My partner had the double expresso and a brandy.we are probably going to go back for the cocktails.place was clean
5
We did not stay at this hotel but we had our lunch instead. It was our very first time being in Singapore and didn't expect to have such a great service from a trainee staff name Shida Keep it up!
5
Great service,great food, great view... Especially with Mannan and his hardworking colleagues around... Always around when needed... Always serving us with a smile on their face...
4
Get spot to just let the world pass you bye
Food and drinks pricey but it's a hotel in the middle of the city so no more than you would expect
5
Great service, very friendly and accommodating! Food was good. Thanks for the birthday card for our friend!
5
Service was too good. Really impressed with the service provided by this gentleman by the name Mannan..good job..keep up the gud work..cheers..
3
Stopped by for a drink at the end of the evening. Ordered 2 beer 330ml and a sangria.Sangria was fine beer was served in a smaller 250ml glass. Not enough larger glasses!????When the check came we were charged the full price for the beer $15.5
4
A very nice cafe in the heart of orchard. Food is reasonable but drinks (especially alcoholic) tends to be a bit pricey. Food is amazing. They have a variety of choices ranging from asian to weatwrn. Good ambiance and servers are always prompt especially Paresh. He is very aware of your needs hence no big effort to call anyone when you needed anything. Very polite and efficient.

1. Food took upwards of 45 mins to arrive. When it did it had been obviously been resting under the salamander for a long time and was cold and dehydrated. Bearing in mind this was post lunch rush at 250pm this is totally unacceptable.2. Worse yet was when we were offered a 1 for 1 cocktail offer.. only to be told at payment the offer was per pax and not per drink so we would have a second drink or forfeit. 3. The only redeeming factor is a manager who did intervene at the end to settle the drink matter.

My husband And i went to crossroads cafe while on a 3 days visit to Singapore "Totally love Singapore" and can't fault any service we received except this cafe, We waited to be seated no one helped us, we then seated ourselves, still no one helped us! eventually i got off my seat and went to ask a waiter for a menu and still no one helped us. The cafe wasn't full. We got up after 15 Minutes and left the cafe, No one even tried to stop us or say something. This was possible the worded service i ever had anywhere
4
I spent 7 weeks at the Singapore Marriott so I had several opportunities to enjoy the Crossroads Cafe. They had a special drinks deal on, two for the price of one. I often came back from work late and needed sustenance, their wagyu beef burger is absolutely fantastic.I had some of their recommended bar "nibbles" too and they were all very good.A great place for people-watching too
4
Excellent location and great food. Excellent service, particularly from Mannan who was friendly and attentive. Had a great evening and would definitely go back.
4
Had a nice lunch here , prices are reasonable considering the location which is in front of Marriott hotel and near the famous Tangs store , great for people watching .
5
I went to this café with my family a few times. For all the times we've been there, we were greeted with friendly waiters and waitresses and good food.
4
Great service by Mannan the waiter, highly recommend to get him to wait and he has good knowledge of the product and suits to your taste buds. Good job Mannan!!I wld like to return with friends and inform others to be waited by this man! Cheers!!

We saw this restaurant on trip advisor before arriving in Singapore and decided we wanted to try it out. It's a very casual dining place but very good. We ordered the nachos which were very different - with chorizo. It was the first time I ate Hainese chicken and it was delicious. Thoroughly enjoyed it and would go back again.
2
I recently went to Crossroad Cafe with several friends from work. While the location was nice and the sitting outside was pleasant, the service was marginal and the prices were absolutely ridiculous even for Singapore. $20 for a beer is just obnoxious
2
Right the location is nice, outisde the Mariott hotel on Orchard road, you can peoplewatch in a nice atmosphere. Now if you are here for the food dont bother. It is nothing special and it is very expensive ( location, location)
5
I dont usually write reviews like this but I happened to drop by this place for lunch a couple of days ago by myself and was pleasantly surprised by the food and service at Crossroads Cafe. I had the all day breakfast and while it was nothing spectacular, the service provided by Ben made the entire experience excellent. He was attentive and at the same time not intrusive and also made light hearted conversation to keep me entertained throughout my lunch. If anyone from Marriott is looking at this, please take note that it is such a waste to put someone like him in just a waiting position. Would definitely recommend this place to other people just for the service itself
2
Ordered a satay skewers and chicken wings, a couple of glasses of wine - what should have been a snack cost more than a very decent dinner in Singapore..... satay overdone and dry, chicken wings battered to death and mediocre wine.... If you think that being seen at the Marriott is impressive, this one if for you, other than that, keep walking! Even the ambiance reminded me of a train station surrrounded by ATMs
5
I'm in Singapore for a few months without family or friends and happens that these lovely guys (waiters) knew it was my bday from a previous visit. They (Mannan, Yasid, Krishnan, Mathan Anthony & John) bought me a card, cocktail on the house followed by a lovely dessert and they even sang happy birthday to me - a special mention and heartful thank you goes to the wonderful Manna who is an absolute gem 
4
Excellent customer service by wait staff, Mannan. Two thumbs up!!!
My girlfriends and I had one for one cocktails. Drinks were great and the service was fantastic. Had a good time. :)
5
A Great atmosphere and place to enjoy a cold beer as you people watch while they stroll or rush past. Never get tired of this place. Execllent service from the staff especially my server "Mannan"
5
One of the main reasons we keep going back to this fabulous restaurant is that you literally watch the world walk past you. Yes, the food is great. But Mannan one of our all time favourite waiters makes the dining experience special every time.
4
After a long afternoon carrying shopping bags up the fabulous Orchard Rd, found an oasis to rest up, watch the others shoppers go by, and enjoy 2 for 1 Singapore sling cocktails! Many thanks for looking after us Mannan.
4
Great food in very good location with friendly staff. Can be very busy so have some patience. It is worth the wait.
5
Once again excellent food and excellent service! Thank you to our wonderful hosts Mannan and Stephenie, and the rest of the very professional team at the Marriott Singapore!
4
I have to thank Mannan and all your staff for having served me today....ver very professional.
Thanks.

Went to the Crossroads Cafe after reading a few TA reviews. Very nice burger and the kids both had pasta which they enjoyed. Only down side was the table was very close to another table of smokers. Service could have been a bit better but good overall.
5
This café/restaurant is in an excellent location ,part if the Marriot Hotel on Orchard road .Food for a café is of a very high quality ,we ate here 3 times in 6 days for lunch while visiting Singapore during the F1 weekend.The food never failed to deliver ,along with a few beers ,this place is in an excellent location. If you are near the Orchard road area ,prices are reasonable ,service is high and well worth a try 
4
This place is part of the Marriott complex on the corner of Orchard Road and Scotts Road. It is under the cover of the main building so is protected from the weather and is a great place for watching people walk by.I visited on a Friday evening and it was full and had plenty of energy. Most of the people around me were couples or small groups of friends. The menu is good for social lunches and chatty dinners and represents good value for money. I had calamari to start followed by a pasta dish and the food was very nice indeed. A good choice of beers is available on tap as well as by the bottle. Overall, I enjoyed the experience and felt comfortable on my own
5
Had a great experience here, Mannan gave the best service ever! Great value for money with a great selection of food..
4
I liked local foods and drinks. Service staff was very friendly. I suggest to taste some different foods here.
5
One of my favourite cafés in the world. Good food, wine and especially service (hi to Stephanie). Best of all the people watching can't beat it.
4
Stephanie offers good service, recommends great food. The portion of the food is just nice. Not only that, the cafe has a good ambience :]
4
Conveniently located at Marriot Hotel, at the crossroads of Orchard Road and Scotts Road, Crossroads Cafe offers ala carte, buffet lunch, high tea and buffet dinner.The restaurant overlooks the busy pedestrain walkway and has indoor and outdoor seating. I visited last weekend with my family and we had the buffet lunch. There is a wide variety of cuisine available, and you will be spoilt for choice:- Cold cuts (Parma Ham and Ham), Cheeses and Breads- Seafood: Oysters, Mussels and Prawns- Soup: Chinese (Old Winter Melon and Barley Soup) and Western soup (Pumpkin Soup)- Japanese: Sashimi and Sushi- Italian Pastas - cooked to order- Chinese: Chicken Rice- Indian: Paneer (Cheese), Curry Fish- Western: Beef Short rib and assortment of vegetables- Oven specials: Crispy pork knuckle & Roast Beef with wide range of condiments- Desserts: Cakes, ice cream, bread puddings and moreNot forgetting freshly-brewed coffee and Tea (They served TWG Tea). Overall, the food quality if good and the restaurant was full when I was there last weekend.If you are looking for a restuarant located at a convenient location just outside CBD, you can visit this restaurant
5
I had a couple of dinners at the Crossroads Cafe within the grounds of the Marriot Hotel on Orchard Road. It is a buzzing place, offering open air and indoor dining. Ideal as well for a glass of wine or coffee, taking a break from the Singapore wonderful shopping. The staff is really nice , especially a young lady called Arin who really was so so friendly and professional. She remembered me the second time I came and really looked after me.... Had some fantastic Singapore Slings there as well
3
This cafe has a good location and nice atmosphere, but paying almost $10 for a coffee is an insult. For that price I want it to be great (and maybe have a macaron on the side). It was ordinary, blah coffee, served in a nice spot
5
stopped by this cafe with my friends while on holiday in singapore and we had excellent drinks from prathip , nathan and mathan were very friendly and hospitality , the service was excellence , we definitely will come back with my friends when visit Singapore again
5
Good food!Good service! Thanks to Ben for providing us with a wonderful experience. Came in for a late lunch/early dinner with my husband after a long day of shopping. Service from all the waiters were very efficient and friendly. Food was wonderful and although quite pricey, was definitely better than your run of the mill restaurants in Orchard Road which tend to serve food that are mediocre at best. We had a few dishes but the the nasi goreng was the highlight. It was fragrant and very flavourful with a variety of ingredients, which made it very interesting on the palette. Drinks were ridiculously expensive though at nearly $25 a beer but apart from that, we would definitely visit this place again, but maybe for special occasions only, where splurging a bit does not feel so sinful
5
The Crossroads cafe is the external cafe of the Marriott hotel Singapore, located at the corner of Scott's and Orchard roads. Under cooling fans, you can eat and drink and meet friends in a relaxed atmosphere while watching the world walk by in a continuous parade of locals and tourists.The menu features an eclectic mixture of standard western bar cafe food... I like the club sandwich and the Reuben, and some eastern dishes, as well as pastas, ribs, steaks, burgers snacks etc. it has a full bar menu with two for the price of one cocktails... My favourite is the Long Island Iced Tea, and various wine choices by glass and bottle including ever changing specials.The other outstanding feature is the friendly and helpful staff... A feature of the Singapore Marriott...my current favourite is Stephanie, a lovely young Phillipina who makes your visit always special. Her friend and compatriot Rosa, with the best smile in Singapore now works in the lobby cafe-diner indoors, just behind the Crossroads, where you can sample the same food and drins and the buffet offerings.There is a nice bar to sit at for you bar flys out there, and a smokers bar at the opposite end of the cafe.See you at the Crossroads soon I hope, and say hi to Stephanie
5
It's my first experience of having dinner at crossroad marriott hotel. Great location and outstanding service of F&B Team especially mathan who very friendly and attentive. Looking forward for my next trip there.
4
Good location for watching the world go past, friendly staff, especially our waiter Mannan, food easy, casual and relaxed. not many opportunities to eat well on the street round here. the best
5
This place is a great place to chill and catch up with some friends. located at the corner of the Orchard. Very warm and friendly service. No wonder all the reviews is perfectly excellent because it really does. :)
2
Ate at Crossroads a good few years ago and wasn't impressed. Not much has changed since then. Menu is typical hotel coffee shop. Service was generally okay but food was not up to the standard set by the high prices (and S$10 for a simple americano is a tad steep)
4
Great friendly service from the staff, despite the fact that the restaurant was pretty full over the weekend. Kudos to Ben and his team who gave us very friendly and warm service. Ambiance was fantastic as mentioned by other people here, due to the location of the restaurant, but food could have been more interesting for the price. Portion size was huge though which did make up some for the lack in flavour
4
I went here for a quick bite on my first night in Singapore. We were severely jet lagged and needed something quick before crashing. We sat outside and even though it was hot, the fans kept the table cool. I had a caesar salad and cream of tomato soup. The tomato soup was under-seasoned, but quite good after I added some salt. The salad was amazing, though my colleague thought it was too salty. The dressing was fresh and "real" (anchovies and all!). We also had a glass of New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc. I did think it was a bit pricy for what we got, but probably normal for a nice hotel restaurant
4
Dropped by this place while on business in Singapore and decided to give it a try. Ambiance was very good for relaxing. It was great to just sit there and watch the world go by. Food was equally good with great flavor and fresh ingredients. Give the Nasi Goreng a try as well as the signature Wagyu Burger. Although the prices are pretty expensive for the food, the portion sizes more than make up for it. Drinks on the other hand are ridiculously pricey though. Service was one of the best I have experienced for a cafe. Ben and the rest of the team provided great attention to detail while not being overly intrusive and were all very friendly. Would definitely come back to this place when I stopover for business in Singapore again
5
This is my 5th stay at the Marriot Singapore and I am absolutely in love with the crossroads cafe. It is the perfect end to a hectic day in Singapore. The food is Devine and the service is even better. Even after returning after 1 year Mannan still remembers my husband and I by our first names and the food and drinks we enjoy. Absolutely super!! His captive smile and warm charm along with the wonderful food and cocktails helps melt our days stress. Today being my birthday the team at cross road arranged a special treat for me. I want to give a special thanks to mathan, prathip, Krishnan, Arin, Samy, Nathan, Shahul, Anthony, Lavina, Ronaldo and Of course the charming Mannan for making the evening extra special. I've uploaded a picture of Mannan and I with my little birthday surprise
5
Good place to chill and relax. Food was great and ambiance was conducive to hang out and watch people go by. Staff were all very friendly, especially Ben who was very knowledgeable about the menu and the local area. This is probably one of the best outdoor places in Orchard Road despite its high prices. You pay for what you get though, so its definitely worth it
4
Located on the corner of orchard rd in a great location. A perfect place to catch up people or for tourists who are in the area and need a break from shopping etc. We visited 3x over the last few weeks for dinner including with a friend from overseas. Food is good, drinks can be a little pricey but it has a great atmosphere. We received complimentary bread which was very tasty. Mannan served us on two of the occasions and his service was outstanding, nothing was too much trouble. Overall, a great spot to visit where you can enjoy a meal and/or drinks in a nice location, with a great outlook
5
Location, location, location. It's the best in town, the service was great, the server Mannan was awesome, fast and prompt. This is my fourth time in Singapore and a stop for dinner at crossroads cafe is a must.
5
Excellent food and atmoshpere for the world cup. Service staffs were friendly and our dear Mannan who served us was indeed a friend to his customers. Thanks for making us keep coming back!!!
4
The cafe is in Scott's Rd. We just dropped in for an evening meal. Food prices very good and excellent service( especially Mannan and Anthony). No trouble to check with chef about my allergies. The food was really good in both presentation and taste. The only down side was the price of drinks. All in all a very pleasant experience which we will repeat sometime soon
5
My favourite hangout in Singapore. Very friendly staff, very attentive. The meny is vast and can be supplemented from the buffet inside. Located outside on corner of Scotts Road and Orchard Road its the perfect place to linger with a glass of wine and see the workd pass by.
4
Stopped by this cafe with my wife while on holiday in Singapore and we had good food and drinks. Service was excellent from Ben and his team who were all very friendly. The place does indeed have a very good atmosphere/ambiance as mentioned by other reviewers. Will definitely be back with my wife when we visit Singapore again at the end of this year
4
We have been going back to this restaurant for a while now and one thing that stood out most has been the great service we get from the team and in particular to Mannan who has been there for a very time. One area they could definitely improve on is to add more fans/mechanical ventilation as it gets really hot and humit most of the time
3
This bar/restaurant is about average for the area. There are better bars (Horse's mouth, down the street) and there is better food (almost any restaurant or hawker place). But as a combination of both, and with good vibe and atmosphere, it's not bad at all and a reasonable hang out.I've now been to it a couple of times. Each time the service was friendly and all the staff worked really hard. They lack organization (or maybe management) so sometimes you have to ask for things 2 (or 3) times before you get them. But the attitude is positive and that's a good thing.The Laksa was good, for a hotel restaurant very good. The tuna BLT on ciabatta very good. Truffle fries were a little "meh" but the veg spring rolls quite good. The spicy chicken wings were not. That is, they were not spicy at all. Could have been a bland version of KFC. I don't know what's up with that.Fun place to watch football. Good atmosphere and they provide food and drinks through the whole period.One thing I really didn't like, and a hint to waiter: when Italy is playing Uruguay, and there are 2 minutes left in the game, and it looks like Italy is about to go out of the world cup, DO NOT PUT A CHARGE SLIP IN FRONT OF AN OBVIOUSLY ITALIAN CUSTOMER AND INSIST HE SIGN IT RIGHT AWAY!!!! It's incredibly rude and inconsiderate. In fact the fact that the customer is Italian is beside the point. Just wait for the game to end!!!!!!
5
This place has been my hang out place for years.... I have always been served by Mr Manan, Mr Krishnen and his team. They are wonderful and always put a smile on our faces when i am here with family and friends. Mr Manan has been great all these years and also his fellow colleagues. Its a really a good spot to relax for coffee, drinks and also great food and at the same time looking at all the people walking around.
5
To all guys who like to hang out with friends and family... Crossroads Cafe is the place.. Even it's a bit warm but with the service provided by Manan and the rest of the crews it's a wonderful experience.. Thanks guys for making our regular trips a wonderful experience!! Cheers.
5
The staff and crew at crossroads cafe sg has placed a special notes in our hearts each and everytime we patronize this cafe. They never fail to impress me and my friends on the way they handle us, with their warmth and personalized service, unlimited smiles, enlightening recommendations and their profesionalism topped it all up. World class service crew who never disappoints. Crossroads cafe, an experience like no other
5
I always start my evening in Singapore. Nice place after shopping. Great Mushroom soup... Cold drinks
5
Crossroads always has ice cold beer on tap with the service of a pleasant staff! The menu is diverse and well served. 👍 to the beautiful Nicole and John!
5
Great place on great location if you like to feel to be in the very heart of S'pore .
Great to grab a table and see the people pass by .
5
Mannan remembers us as returning customers! That's valuable! And of course to top it up, good quality food!
5
Spent a week at the marriott, every night our table was ready and our drinks were waiting on us. Couldn't ask for better service away from home! Thanks Mannan
5
The food was good here and the service was really great. Our server Mannan was really accommodating and even recommended good places for us to visit while in Singapore!
4
Really good spot for shopping (we went in to ion afterwards), and great for people watching. Good food - the ribs are good and also the local speciality Hainanese Chicken Rice.
5
Good food, great location to just chill have a drink and people watch.
The GALS there offer excellent customer service
5
Im Shahrein and Im from Brunei, I'm having my vacation here, Singapore. Currently Im here at Crossroads Cafe, Marriot Hotel for watching fifa worldcup 2014. I came here twice and honestly served by your staff, Mannan (nametag). He's a good customer service and well manner staff, good approach by Mannan. Good service ever in Singapore. Keep it up.
5
Came in late night alone without a clue what to drink. Only to find a menu full of varieties. Greeted by a very friendly waiter (Mannan) whom recommended a good drink. So good that i ordered twice. With the atmosphere and good hospitality, i didn't feel alone. But i did wish i came with my friends. A good place to hang out. Too bad i wont be here during world cup. Would be an excellent place to watch a gam
5
Since we had drinks here during our honeymoon I always come back during my business trips for a quick beer or a tuna sandwich. Its beautiful to sit here on the outside and spot people walking buy.
5
Been visiting for 8 years. Always great atmosphere. Food is good and the service is excellent. Stephanie is exceptionally welcoming and sets a high standard for others to follow.
5
Arin is the best very service orientated recommended the best wine and food,, enjoyed the crossroads,, keep it up,,, only set back is the cigar smoke,,
5
I can recommend you to visit this place. good for dinner and meeting people. the tenderloin steak was prepared in a perfect manner.
5
The staff are very friendly. They always find ways for you to enjoy your stay at the hotel. Food selection are great.
5
Stopped by for breakfast at this place with my wife when we were in Singapore recently. Although the coffees were quite expensive, the chilli crab omelette was simply amazing and definitely very unusual. Service was excellent and Ben, the waiter, kept us entertained with many intersting stories about the local culture and history of Singapore. Would definitely recommend this place to other people. It even comes with a smoking bar!
5
Been here last April with friends. We had a bottle of wine (over hundreds of selection) and sumptuous meal. Service was great, food quality was superb and location was really perfect. Have travelled to Thailand and Philippines for the past three weeks and nothing have surpassed my dining experience at Crossroads
4
More than a cafe it has a nice American and local fare menu with a great location on Orchard Road. People watching day and night at its best. We frequent the location on weekends and I often have my favorite item the Wagu Burger it is worth the price given the great flavor and venue. This location has a real buzz about it and offers some great coffees. Two things to watch out for. The first is the smoking section so try to sit near the main bar away from the smokers however the wind will sometimes make it difficult to escape the second hand smoke. Secondly the pricing on soft drinks is the highest in the city with no refills,last check was $9.50. Great staff that try hard to please and usually do . Relax and sit back to enjoy the venue
5
Great place to take a rest from shopping. Brilliant happy hour on the cocktails and tasty bar snacks. Great service by our friendly waiter Mannan who made sure my sister and I were well taken care of as well as making sure my young nephew was comfortable whilst he slept by providing a cushion without being asked. Overall I definitely recommend Crossroads Cafe and shall be going back myself
5
Its definitively the place to go to relax in the outside on orchard for lunch or dinner. Im regularly on business trip in sg and i always come there not only because the staff is fantastic, young, skilled always helpful( love u guys) but also because the food is delicious! Local or western, the quality of the food is outstanding, the taste of the courses like nowhere and the shares are far above what you will find in any restaurants in sg.Congratulations to all the staff and antony that made this place a unique harbor in sg!Thank u guys!Jm quile
5
The ultimate pavement bar/cafe right in the heart of Orchard Road.
Great place to unwind with a glass of wine after a hard days shopping !
5
Just had a lovely dinner here. I loved my Tortilla Wrap. The staffs made it more enjoyable. They entertained me throughout the evening. The service was quick and effecient. They made me very comfortable.
5
My favorite place to eat in Singapore. Food is good, service is excellent and while you eat you can watch the world go by. Perfect combination of food, service and people watching.
5
Was amazed a particular staff, Mannan remembered us after one visit! We got our favorite smoking area seat and was very delighted with his service. Will definitely come again!
1
Mystified....I walk in and ask for table for one, mention I need a quick meal, have to be out by 12 pm. Waitress walks me into air con dining area....five of eighteen tables occupied. She attempts to seat me at a table which still has dirty crockery on it. I move myself to one of many clean available tables. Extraordinary....why would you train staff to this
4
The restaurant is a place I often visit during weekends for dining and drinking. It is a nice and pleasant place to sit down and relax while listening to the soft music and talking to friends. There are variety of food, including local dishes and international choices, and the wines and drinks here just blown me away. The waiters and waitresses are friendly, epsecially Mr. Mannan, who alway gives his guests big smiles, and serves with passions
5
I am Italian, and at least once a year, My family and I come back to Singapore because my mum is Singaporean. Everytime we go to Singapore we go to Crossroads Cafe about two or three times a week. We love the location, you can sit down and have something to eat while seeing people walk by and the food is absolutely Brilliant! The staff is so nice as well, especially these 5, Mannan, Arin, Stephanie, Misty, and Nathan. Because they treat you like family. I highly recommend this restaurant
5
This has been a my regular late dinner venue but have yet to really write anything about it. I have always enjoy my meals here, and the service are great and friendly, loves their mushroom soup and risotto. Had tasted their Nasi Goreng, Tom Yam Soup and Hokkien mee, all well make and this is a great place to people watch. And they close late on weeken
5
We come here for dinner and lunch very often and we always love it! Great food, both local and international, in particular the Wagyu Burger... and we appreciate a lot the customer care they reserve us, they recognize us every time and make us feel at home, especially Mannan, who is always friendly and never overtly intruding.
5
The friendly staff always helps me to get delicious food that is appropriate for my restricted diet. The chefs are aware of my taste preferences and always modify to suit my requests. It is always lovely to eat at crossroads and it is open late which is essential for me. Not always easy to find a good restaurant open late. Love the place, love the chefs and most of all love the excellent staff. 
5
Food was very good plus the service is excellent. The staff who served us, Mannan, was very accommodating. He made sure we were comfortable and he also helped us choose the dishes we like. Thank you Mannan!
5
For my last night in Singapore I went here and Mannan was my waiter. Very attentive and helpful. Food and wine were fantastic and Mannan helped me choose the best menu items. This is a must try!
5
Good Ambience,,Good food and drinks and Very Good service especially to Mannan..very nice person in there..thx to mannan n crossroad cafe
5
I am usually not one for writing reviews but after travelling for 4 months I realized how many establishments really rely on positive feedback for their business. I must say after being on the road for 4 months, our server was one of the kindest people my boyfriend and I met. We were looking for a nice decently priced restaurant for our one year anniversary and crossroads cafe was above and beyond our expectations. The atmosphere there is great and the food is delicious. I would highly recommend the cheese platter. It was outstanding. If you go, make sure to ask for Mannan. He made our dinner experience an unforgettable one. He even went out of his way and treated us for dessert on the house.
5
I travel to Singapore on a regular basis and always stay at the Marriott, reason being, the service is second to none. No hotel staff can beat the Marriott staff. The Crossroads Cafe is the perfect spot to sit back and relax while taking in the atmosphere. One staff member in particular is Mannan.... he has a skill of remembering you by name and is always happy to provide the amazing service Marriott is known for! The breakfast selection is vast and make sure you order and omelet or eggs to your liking! The chef there will put a smile on your face and he'll make sure your days starts well!Thank you Marriott staff
5
I have been a regular customer to crossroads cafe for several years.Main reason is its location, the extended opening hours, the good food, but above all the excellent and friendly staff, especially with Mannan. It is always a pleasure to meet him back at the terrace.I would highly recommend the place due to its friendliness staff
4
Chosen crossroads as they have always been consistent in terms of food quality, selection, service in both their ala carte as well as buffet menu. We have been here a few times for dinner for the ala carte menu and decided on the buffet menu for our family gatheringAs expected for this visit, the food is once again. As expected, the food is once again delicious, and pleasing everyone in my family from parents to my sisters. There is a dish for everyone. The buffet selection is varied with a combination of western, chinese, local, japanese and Indian, all done with a good standard of authenticity in terms of flavours and ingredients.. We particularly enjoyed the chinese noodles and pasta stations whereby we get to select our own ingredients and the cook prepares the dish for us on the spot. The seafood station is certainly worth a mention with its very fresh selection of prawns, crabs, oysters. We chose to sit outside as we enjoy the view of looking at people passing by along Orchard road and The vibrant lively and bustling atmosphere also helps in adding to the air of festivity for my dad's birthday celebration . The restaurant was quite crowded but the service was prompt and friendly. Happy to be back again and that my family enjoyed it as much as we do
5
Perfekt location to relax after a exausting day in the evening with a very tasty diner. After being here for 1 week we have been always guided in a perfect way by our very friendly waiter MANNAN to place the right order. We really enjoy the perfect and professional approach and assistence of MANNAN for a nice evening in Singapore. Crossroads Cafe without MANNAN is no way. Thanks for all â™¡ Angela & Bjoern Klaus Hope to see you next time again

Having passed by this alfresco-concept restaurant with ceiling fans and a wide arena for diners to enjoy people watching, I have always been wanting to dine here. Opportunity finally presented itself and I had breakfast there.The Marriott Breakfast Set is sumptuous - an authentic American breakfast heaven consisting of all the essentials. My healthier oatmeal and muesli set was tasty too. We enjoyed the food and overall ambience - for more details and photos, please visit: http://thearcticstar.blogspot.sg/2013/11/breakfast-at-crossroads-cafe-marriott.htm

Came here with my hubby. I ordered the 100% wagyu beef burger and my husband ordered the chicken satay. Chicken satay was ok. My burgers meat had a funny smell and an even funnier taste. I did not like it at all. I did not bring it up to the waiter since when I told them my coke was flat they made a big deal about changing it out. We ordered a drink called Zombie. It was great. Very strong. So even though our food was not great the drinks and the people watching made up for it. Would recommend for drinks and sitting outside to enjoy the nite but not the food
4
This outdoor cafe is part of the Marriott Hotel complex. Great corner is a great place to people watch for hours. Food is good. Customary bar offerings. Nice mix of beers on tap. Staff is great, very attentive.
3
Food is reasonably good but you are paying a premium for a great location. Can recommend the calamari starter. Probably a better place for a drink and soaking up the atmosphere than a food destination
5
Loved loved loved this restaurant!Excellent ambiance, extremely helpful and smiling staff..they have good options for vegetarians and are also willing to cater to special requests. will be definitely revisiting on my next visit
to Singapore! Thank u beatrice, mina and all of the other staff
4
This is a great place to chill out in midst of a busy bays shopping in orchard road. The aptly named cafe allows one to enjoy a great meal, a nice drink and a chance to watch the world go by. The drinks, as can only be expected from a hotel in Singapore, are pretty pricey, even for Singapore but the menu is good, the food excellent and the atmosphere wonderful. My partner regularly enjoys their superb laksa (don't compare prices to hawkers laksa because it's about 8 times the price!) which really is outstanding and value for money, whilst I have the Ruben sandwich - fat, full, flavoursome and delicious. The portions are big. Forego the $20 drink, have a lime and soda and enjoy. One small drawback is the service which is a little slow. 20 minutes to sign for the bill after giving them my payment was a bit much

$10 Singapore for a Coke should be enough to tell you how overpriced it is. Good food, decent cocktails, friendly service, and an expansive buffet. We tried it because it was raining and our hotel was right there...won't be going back during our stay, but fine for a quick and reliable meal

We wanted to have some small lunch dishes and a glass of red house wine.We ordered Chicken wings and Calamari The chicken wings were disgusting worse that KFC I imagine. Just a lot of old oily bread crunch not eatable. (This was recommended)The Calamari was totally tasteless and too chewy.We ate very little of the served so call foodA Marriott Hotel!!!!Two glass of simple house wine SGD 46. A lot even in Singapore.This was awful and totally overpriced and the music just too loud.However they deducted the food from the check which was honorably done

at tbe cross of orchard and scotts road this cafe is the perfect place fr people watch and also to unwind after a day of frenzied shopping in orchard road . the beer is ice cold , the food is fresh and the service is friendly and efficient. a great time to go is during breakfast to relax and watch the city slowly come to life .
5
The outdoor area of the Crissroads, right on the Orchard/Scotts intersection walkway, is my comfort supper stop every time I'm in Singapore, whether I stay at the Marriott or not. One of those places where you feel at ease even if alone: cozy, relaxed, varied food (both Asian and international), smiling service, you can watch he Singapore movida from your comfortable table. Whether alone or in company, whether for a meal or just a beer, don't miss it to recharge your batteries

The Crossroads Cafe at the Marriott hotel possibly provides the best sidewalk cafe experience in Singapore. Fantastic place for people watching - constant flow of all kinds of people walking by. Great food - including local items (south east Asian). Not cheap, but very much worth a visit (or two or three). If you're staying at the Marriott, this is the best place to have breakfast when starting your day
5
Every morning my partner and I would wander down to the Crossroads Cafe for a delicious buffet breakfast. I was impressed that on day 2 the staff remembered what type of coffee we liked and ordered it for us as soon as they saw us walk in. Service with a smile and very attentive staff
4
The staff here are extremely attentive and friendly though the prices are a bit shocking when the bill comes. A great spot for people watching and grabbing a quick bite or drink.
2
This bar is overpriced. $11 for a take away sprite was just way over the top. There are not many bars in the area so you are paying for the location.
4
I always go there cause of exellent and friendly service. Especially the waitress Lailanie Jane. Very helpfull and quick, always fiendly also when busy. I will be ther soon again and hope the service remains the same.
5
It's not often that the hotel restaurant is so good that I eat there more than other restaurants, but Crossroads Cafe was awesome! Also hostess Mina Divina was GREAT!

Crossroads Cafe is one of those places that we always have at least one meal, when we are in Singapore.It is attached to the Marriott hotel and is on the corner of Orchard and Scotts Road. The openlocation is great for people watching and the East meets West food concept is not bad either.Service is always really good. The food is good but expensive for Singapore. I can recommend the prawn tempura ($SGD28) and the chicken tom yam ($SGD16). The nasi goreng ($SGD23) used to be amazing but the dish has now changed and I would only rate it as okay.The only downside for me is the close proximity of the high stool tables where patrons are allowed to smoke - not pleasant for a non-smoker. Choose the tables nearest the bar or at the front to avoid this.Otherwise - stop at the Crossroads and enjoy the ever-changing parade of tourists and locals

I was late for dinner. Didn't venture too far from hotel. Saw a good crowd. My acid test for something good.Good service from waitress esp. Stephanie very attentive and anticipated before I asked and great suggestion.Ordered Schnitzel not great but typical bar food. Draft Erdinger was great as you will expect.
5
Crossroads Cafe is definitely the place to visit when traveling through Singapore, to sit and enjoy the good food and people watch makes for a very relaxing meal. I had both breakfast and dinner here during my stay and I was able to relax, enjoy good food and fantastic service. My breakfast was served by Mina, and even though it was busy nothing was too much trouble, my tea cup was never empty and the service was impeccable. In fact because of the service I decided to return for dinner, the restaurant was even busier and the people watching more intense with multitudes of shoppers passing by. Mina wasnâ€™t working and I was served by Lailanie, she was equally impressive, very fast, and very attentive. She took my order, delivered my food and drinks with just enough follow up to make sure everything was perfect without being intrusive. Crossroads location is fantastic, its food good and the service outstanding. All of the staff should be congratulated but Mina and Lailanie deserve special mention

Marriott touts this as a fresh buffet, and it is. Food is constantly being changed out, or cooked fresh in front of you. But, it is a buffet and it can be chaotic and hectic, depending on what tour group is passing through!All restaurants are located right next to each other and basically use the same tables. You can order from whichever menu you like. Kind of different and noisy at times
4
Singapore Marriott has always been my preferred hotel everytime I visit Singapore. Never once I visit Crossroads located at the front entrance. Two weeks ago a colleague invited me for dinner at Crossroads. Lucky for me, I made a reservation earlier. This place is always full at nearly all time. With various choices of drink and food, we had a great time there. The outdoor seating allows you to sulk and enjoy evening at the busy Orchard - Scotts Road intersection. Price is fair considering the hotel setting. Pork Belly was really good! Best I ever had so far. Definitely returning!

This place is the perfect place to stop for a drink during a big shopping trip. My husband and I stayed in the connected Marriott Hotel so we stopped quite a few times. It's great for people watching. The drinks are expensive but strong so I don't recommend staying all afternoon. They also have some good food. We had the scallop appetizer and chicken club sandwich. Both were excellent though highly priced as everything in Singapore is. I recommend the Lynchburg Lemonade and Singapore Sling. Both were tasty without being too sweet. I will definitely get drinks here next time I'm in Singapore

We spotted this cafe when we arrived on Orchard Road and decided to have lunch there. We ordered one burger and two soft drinks and was charge $50. Our first two soft drinks were flat and had to be returned. We sat outside to enjoy the atmosphere however the smokers made this an unpleasant experience. The service was good however would not recommend this cafe
4
My boyfriend and I stopped here for the main purpose of having a few drinks before going shopping along Orchard Road. We were seated straight away (unlike some other reviewers' experiences!) and had menus brought over. Our waiter 'Mannan' was amazing - he was smiling all the time, and we saw him checking each table and making sure everyone was happy. He also told us about their cocktail promtion which was wouldn't have noticed otherwise, (2-4-1 which makes them seriously good value!) and was keen to recommend some too :) He had been trained well, and was very competent. We shared a Club Sandwich which was nice. It's nothing to blow you away, but I can't fault it. For the price, ($18?) is was perfectly acceptable. You come here for the location and to sit outside (great people watching place!) while having a few drinks. It's nice and relaxed, good service (compared to so many places in Singapore) with a smile

come to crossroad by accident with my friends during lunch hours. the cafe was full.at first it takes us around 5-10 minutes to get seated.the burger have a good look, but after we eat it the taste was not as good as it looks, and the juicy from the meat were too much that the burger bun could easily turn reds because it absorb the overwhelming juice from the meat. the creme brulee was a disaster for a cafe opened under the marriott management. the caramel was so hard, that i need to put an extra effort just to break it with my spoon, and the texture was much more like hard pudding. and the taste very plain. the service, need much more improvement, because it takes almost fifteen minutes, 1 waiter, and 1 supervisor from the first taking order, just to let me know that my selection of tea was not available.The location, without no doubt is the PRIME location!!!
1
When we arrived, no one seated us but a lot of staff were around. We asked for the menu ourselves. The worst part is, when my husband asked for the menu again to order for a dessert, he asked the manager who was clearing up a table next to us if the cream brûlée is recommended. He just shook his head and said YES. Hahahaha ha! Awesome! No other words but YES! We have seen around 5 to 6 staff but the only outstanding staff I would praise is the only CHINESE boy who asked us each time if we need another glass of white wine or any help. He does it to all table unlike those staff who were really annoyingly noisy and talking to each other like no one's business! Will definitely not come back!

Had lunch at this restaurant on a number of occassions. Great place to people watch but we have noticed that the quality of food has deteriorated over the last couple of years. Was my daughters favourite place for a burger but we don't go anymore. There is so much choice in the area at comparable of lower prices that's better. The lunch buffet does look good but we've never tried it.Siting outdoors is great, however we were getting fed up with inhaling smoke over lunch. There is a counter at the end of the cafe where smokers sit. Unfortunately if the wind blows in the wrong directions it comes straight through the restaurant.We have always found the serice to be efficient and friendly. Prices are as one would expect at the Marriott

First, I must start this review by saying that as a Marriott Platinum Elite member, we did not have to pay the $38 per person charge for the breakfast buffet each morning as this is one of the benefits offered to Elite members at this hotel. Personally, I'm not a big breakfast fan so I'd find it hard to justify paying $38 for any breakfast buffet but if any buffet would be worth paying $38 for, this one would have to be considered.The quality and quantity of food offered was excellent. They offer a wide variety of both western and Asian selections. Made to order eggs, wide variety of fresh fruit, a daily made to order fresh fruit smoothie bar, noodles, meats, fresh baked breads and pastries (I couldn't get enough of the cinnamon raisin bread). The choices go on and on. They also include freshly made specialty coffees such as cappuccinos, espressos and lattes. The only regret I had over the five days we ate here were the couple of extra pounds I'm sure I added to my waistline at the end of our stay!The restaurant has a very relaxing and laid back atmosphere with a huge center island cooking area. You can eat inside or outside and people watch along famous Orchard Rd. There is a full service bar in the outside dining area as well.I can't speak to the quality of food for lunch or dinner but judging how crowded the restaurant was during these times it must be just as good as breakfast,Definitely give it a try, even with the $38 price tag and absolutely take advantage and eat here if you're a Elite member staying at the Marriott.You can't beat the price

I like to think that I am a bit of a laksa connoisseur and this is the best I have ever tasted. In fact I had to go back twice just to make sure.While we were there they were doing a drinks promotion of buy one get one free on the cocktails so that was a good excuse to go through the cocktail list as well.Service was efficient and staff helpful but the main attraction of this cafe would be the location as you can sit and enjoy good food and people watch at the same time. Ideally located
4
I always come here, cos the location is the best! And you can find it easy just at the corner of orchard road. A coffee is a must, normally I only have coffee here, never order food.Nice cafe you can sit at the bar table, watch many funny person walking in front of you. I like this coffee shop
4
This is the best place in Singapore for having a beer and watching the world go by.Great selection of beers and the food is varied and excellent. service is really good as well.Not exactly cheap, it is after all part of a five star hotel, nut well worth it

Just had the lousiest Caesar salad with soggy lettuce leaves and way too much dressing (probably to disguise the soggy lettuce). The chef is out here with 2 of his colleagues talking to 2 guys for over half an hour already. I suggest he goes back to his kitchen and makes sure the dishes that go out are of a better quality:-
3
Great place to watch the world go by - but it comes at a price. At SIN$ 9.00 ++ for a cup of coffee you pay twice as much as in most other cafes.
3
Great place to people watch, and watch the world go by on any lazy Sunday afternoon.
Food is tad expensive. Limited variety. Service staff are mostly friendly but when they get busy, they get inattentive.
5
Located above the underpass to the mrt station, this cafe serves international cuisine, and wine. Perfect time to visit this cafe? Dinner time! The ambience is quite nice for having dinner with a little chat. Highly recommended!
4
Food here is always good. Sit, drink, eat and watch the world go by. Watch out for the service charge and GST which should be made clearer but all in all a great experience.
3
The prices here do not make you want to return and the food quality as well as diversity of the menu has declined over the years. Service is great and very friendly and the location is ideal. The prices and food though really dampen the experienc

This cafe is a great place to sit and watch the busy Orchard Road world go by ... there is a steady stream of shoppers and communters going by and you could entertain yourself with the fascinating, changing view for hours. You may need to ... the service at this cafe, whilst very friendly, is very slow ... after you are seated and given a menu there is quite a gap between attendances by staff to take and deliver orders. Even the bill is slow in coming. As far as the food goes, I had lunch here - I ordered the Heritage Salad - this is small, not enough for a meal, even with the complimentary (very nice) bread provided. The heroes of the dish are the heritage tomatoes, several types - but they are hidden under a shower of sprouts and a very meagre sprinkling of fetta and avocado. However, I will say the fresh fruit platter is possibly the most impressive I've ever seen - beautifully presented and marvellously fresh and delicious. That was good
5
We come here every time we visit singapore. It is expensive but you can sit an war h the world go by as they traverse probably the busiest cross roads in Malaysia (orchard and Scott's road). Go fir a table and not the bar seating area on the outside as tables tend to be ar conditioned. Toilets are inside past the glorious buffet provided for the Marriott guests and a bit f walk back. There are some live music venue clubs further inside the hotel but you don't hear them while drinking your gin and tonic outside...remarkably relating considering its locatio
2
This was a good regular place to meet people I was travelling with and grab an occasional quick meal, but after repeatedly paying (from memory) $18 for a latte and $20 for a glass of beer we decided to change the meeting venue. The place was never full which is good, but perhaps an indication of the price
5
We had lunch sitting inside near the lobby at Crossroads Cafe. My croque monsieur was good but my wife's dom yum gy lacked the usual amount of chicken. There seemed to be confusion as the staff brought us someone else's order.Breakfast was part of our package, and we chose to eat at Crossroads Cafe instead of at the Club room which seemed a bit small. We sat close to the building in the outdoor area and not close to the sidewalk because we don't feel drawn to crowds, especially in the early morning. We watched robber birds try to steal food scraps from plates before they were taken inside. Using my croissants index for breakfast buffet, Crossroads is 5 out of 5 with a light flaky croissant that is memorably delicious. They also provide a wide range of fine qualify dishes in the breakfast buffet. They had both streaky and back bacon. We ate so much that we simply did not have room to try the bread and butter pudding that looked especially inviting. The staff bring fruit juice and coffee and tea as you need it. The staff were unusually helpful and friendly, making Crossroads Cafe our most memorable buffet breakfast location in Singapore to date

Had lunch here a couple of times. Very friendly staff and a broad menu. Portion size varies; my wife had a salad that was very small and the satays were not vey filling. On the other hand, the Reuben sandwich and burgers are huge. Prices were ok but like other eateries you need to add on the 10% service fee and the gst of 7%
3
food was decent for a corner cafe in a hotel. Watch out for salads - order dressing on the side or it comes swimming in dressing
4
good spot to have a dinner or just a glass of wine watching the fashionable people walk by. the wine list was superbe !
4
We live in Singapore and typically avoid restaurants associated with hotels, but we love the crossroads cafe. It is a great place to people watch and you can get the most "american"-tasting burger in Singapore there!
3
The drinks are over priced compared with all other outlets in the area, the menu is very limited for westerners and the staff are poorly managed.
2
Nice place to sit and have a coffee. My food - club sandwich - was really disappointing. Fries were barely warm and the sandwich was served on bog standard supermarket white bread. Was expecting more from the Marriott especially given the price. I also didn't read the menu carefully was expecting some nice grilled chicken breast, but instead got turkey ham. Coffee was nice however
3
Crossroads Cafe is at the crossroads of Scotts and Orchard Road. Neat little space for tired shoppers to grab a bite and some drinks. The space is small and you are seated very close to each other. When other patrons walk, you have to keep shifting the chairs to create a path. That also is a problem when waitresses and waitress buzz around the cafe. I had the crossroads split, not bad I would say. For drinks, I had the long island tea, a little disappointing as it's too sour for me. My partner had the ice mocha and the beans had a burnt taste. It's not what we would expect from Marriott and I would only visit when I really need a break from all that walking

Crossroads Cafe used to be one of my favourite dining spot in Singapore, especially when I am on Orchard road. The food used to be great and the menu quite varied. Unfortunately after the renovation, I cannot say that anymore, which is such a shame.It still is a great place to sit and " people watch" but the new menu has been really parred down. In fact it is rather uninspiring. I used go there for their quesidillas, great variety of salads and soups and specials of the day.The evening I went we ordered mushroom truffle soup, which was very bland. There were only three type of salads left on the menu. so we ordered the ubiquitous caesar salad and penne arabiatta. The caesar was okay as caesar salad goes, nothing unique about it. The arabiatta was a disaster, it was heavily salted and inedible.We asked for it to be changed which was done with no fuss. The replacement dish arrived but it was bland and was just average. I have to say the service crew were polite but the place was heavily understaffed. There were only 2 people around that evening to service 20 odd tables. It took a while to get their attention everytime we needed something and then another long wait before our request was met.I am not sure I would make it a point to dine there anymore, maybe just to stop by for predinner drinks. Incidently, the clientele there has also changed. I use to see alot of people dining there but that evening most people were just drinking. Could that be because the food on offer has really gone downhill??
5
At $38++ per person for a weekday breakfast buffet, we expected a wide variety of local and international spread and that was exactly what they delivered. Plenty of variety from fresh fruit to beef rendang displayed very tastefully, invoking the inner glutton in you to go for more food. The ambience was modern but cosy and the service was excellent, a rare combination in this city. The friendly staff took their time to engage on friendly conversation while making sure we always had piping hot coffee. Loved it
4
We had an excellent salad and the burger was really good. The location is great to sit and watch the vast number of people walking past.We did not get very good service, it was really busy. Once the wine was served, we had to keep asking about the bread basket a couple of times, but when the basket arrived, the bread was still warm from the oven. Delicious
4
Went there to have a steak and watch a world cup match. I got it all. Good service, good food (actually my steak was excellent), nice selection of wines by the glass (although a but too young in general). There is in addition the possibility to dine "outside" (covered terrace that is cooled by a form of air conditioning). Quality has however its price, especially in a international hotel chain (Marriott in this case). I think furthermore they serve 24/7.All together, quite a commendable place
