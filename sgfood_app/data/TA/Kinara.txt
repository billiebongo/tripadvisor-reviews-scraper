For dinner think Boat quay is much better than clrake quay as you can enjoy your food with great views and its not loud so nice for chit chat too

If you are North Indian food lover and are in Singapore then this restaurant is a must try.
Authentic North Indian food with good service.
Lovely ambience to have dinner by the river side with perfect view of central Singapore sky-scrappers.

Was at Kinara for dinner on the 3rd of August. Very nice ambience in an alfresco setting. Food was good and our Indian guests were quite impressed.
1
Boat Quay is a good place for hanging and having various cuisines especially for dinner. Kinara’s food completed disappointed us on 3rd March dinner. We had ordered Paneer Chatpata, Navrattan Akbari, Lasuni (Garlic) Naan and Missi Roti along with Boondi Raitha which was followed by Pista Kulfi. Now all these sounds tempting to eat, unfortunately that wasn’t the reality at all. More than 2/3rd of Navrattan Akbari was left out, Lasuni Naan wasn’t tasting like Garlic Naan, Missi Roti seemed half cooked and Pista Kulfi made from milk powder tasting so horrible that we had to leave it completely.Only suggestion to Kinara people - improve the quality of food else kindly shutdown the restaurant
5
The food here is outstanding, the portions are generous, and the gentlemen always take good care of us. They are also very very nice about taking care due to my food allergies. I recommend: - sitting by the river (the view is gorgeous, especially as the sun sets and the lights of the cbd come up)- the kashmiri pulau, the bindi masala, crab banjala, saffron rice, chicken tikka, naan, aloo gobi...

It's not "just another Indian restaurant". The food here is really very good and reasonably priced.We ate here as a family and were so impressed that we had them cater for a get together we hosted.The achari murg, seekh kebab, butter chicken, laal maas & bhindi kurkure were particularly outstanding.The pricing for the catering was also extremely reasonable.It's a must visit place for Indian food
3
food was normal, what you would find at indian restaurants. tandoori chicken was a bit undercooked. a waiter spilled lassi on my uncle's back, no apology from manager or anyone. ordered a coke light, and it only came 15 minutes later after repeating request. palak paneer was great, so was the butter chicken. i would recommend the kinara's at east coast, better service and food.
4
Out of many Indian restaurants in boat quay we chose Kinara coz one of my friends have told me about this. Food quality is good but its very overpriced. I guess we paid the price more for the view than the food. Otherwise everything else is good about it
4
I was looking for lunch spot on Friday, found this restaurant in boat quay while pass by. Food really nice not spicy. Restaurant is very cozy setup, lighting, seating just reflecting the Indian culture. Cooking and storing in Brass utensils is good for health. Crowd is mixed crowd.
4
This review is based on my first time ever eating Indian food. I enjoyed the food; spicy, chicken and meat tender and vegetables cooked a very different way. It was dinner so we ordered a sampling of a half-dozen dishes including lamb and chicken. Wines offered were of a good selection. Ambience on the riverside at night was a great setting for the evening. Owner was very hospitable along with the waitstaff. I would go back and try other dishes. Our companions who are "foodies" and raved about the wide selection of food offering, although food and drink are not inexpensive.
4
We went for a dinner with family. we were 13-14 of us. Nice starters, great view of the river and good ambiance. Service was good. The overall food was very good. The indian breads were also very good
4
I was there before also but this time I was with family and friends for dinner the place is on river side with beautiful view , the food is good and reasonably priced and specially the boti kebab was excellent
5
This is a great find. Spectacular views of the river and Singapore's skyline, complemented by really excellent North Indian food from a huge menu. Vegetarian-friendly and just wonderful. I've been there twice now, once with a group and today solo, and I will be back.
4
We got a great meal, but we asked for a suggestion and got the feeling that we were ripped off when we got to see the price.
5
The food was excellent so was the attentive staff and river view. Quite pricey, perhaps better for occasions such as birthdays or anniversary.
5
We especially loved the ambience because of the outdoor sitting next to the river. Food was good too!
2
Everything I ordered was average. The pakoras were terrible. The main course was fine. Only good thing about the restaurant is the view and the idea of open air dining. Probably would never go back to this place.
4
If one is in Singapore, he/she must visit Boat quay area and if one like Indian food, one of the best options is Kinara. Best time to have meal is dinner at night. Very good view and good north Indian food too. One can have leisure dinner and enjoy Singapore in different way

We were a party of 6 arriving for lunch - on time per the booking made under one of our colleague's name who is of Japanese descent. As it was under his name, our colleague approached the staff who was 'enticing' walk in customers to dine at the nearly empty restaurant. The greeting staff was extremely rude to our colleague from the start. He made our colleague repeated his name many times rather than just being gracious and checking their bookings - Do they have any? Despite the restaurant being almost empty he had the guts to ask for how many people. As it was a work lunch the group decided to stay though if it was up to me we would have walked out almost immediately. The table was put together haphazardly and without care, metal chairs were literally thrown to place. Food was lukewarm though it tasted ok however strangely when one colleague wanted to order more food, another wait staff said she could not as it had to be cooked again ?! One Indian colleague actually said this place is ok for North Indian food. Shame as I would not advocate this place to anyone due to the terrible service
3
Late in the evening (after 10pm) we walked, hungry, along the crowded dock with crowded restaurants. We did not want European cuisine, we eat that in Europe, we chose by our intuition and it proved very reasonable, both the service and the quality of the food. Amazing vue.We would not go on purpose, but being on the spot I consider it a good choice
5
Thoroughly enjoyed my lunch at this excellent curry house. Loved the menu but I asked them to create an old favorite of mine which they did with perfection. 10/10 and I'll be back.
5
This place has been serving Indian food for over 20 years.Located in the Boat Quay ,it is conveniently located and good for lunch and dinner.
3
Good Indian but not great, I probably paid the premium for the view. Quick service, seems clean. I probably could have chosen better withoutvstarving children but nice enough. $120 for 2 curries, rice, bread, 2 beers and water seems a lot.
3
Singapore has better places for Indian food , but if you want to enjoy one at boat quay this can be tried
3
Went on a 30 oct evening , and he kept taking patrons with no space . Borrowed the adjoining restaurant's space. Kept every one waiting. Needed 30 minutes to bring repeat nan or pickle for the first time. food average but not able to cope with the traffic
4
There are a vast number of places to dine at along Boat Quay, we happened to select Kinara. The server was quite welcoming upon arrival, but then the service started to slow down.Each of the dishes was very good, we were extremely happy with the quality and quantity of what we selected, except for the rice dish, they forgot to serve it, so we went without despite prompting them that it had not been served. The wine was a reasonable price, considering that wine in Singapore restaurants is quite expensive
5
Since the restaurant is located at boat quay so the experience has to be wonderful. Would like to mention that hilland village branch is also excellent in all aspects. I like mulligtwany shorba the most. Mutton laal maans is another wonderful delicacy prepared only in their outlets. Best part is weekdays lunch hv a great offer of 50% off on using any credit card
2
The prices are way above average, the taste average or below average, the tap water had a weird taste to it, the portions of curry were pretty big but the taste is flavorless, you can get cheaper and better in other places. Otherwise, the seats near the river could be nice with a lover or family. It's a bit difficult to get there and there are tons of other restaurants in the area. I wouldn't advise going there
4
Our group enjoyed dining on the river at Boat Quay. The views are spectacular and the severs are attentive. The food was good but not extrordinary. I do think it was better than most of the Indian food I've had in the US but there is more competition in Singapore. I would definitely eat here again
4
Authentic north indian food at one of the famous indian food chains in singapore serving veg as well as non veg food. This outlet has a great backdrop as its on boat quay and u can always go for a boat ride before or after the meal. One of the boat drop off points is pretty close too. Service is good. Presentation is fine nothing too fancy. Sweet mango chutney was a surprise addition to the usual condiments though. Mango lassi was superb.
4
Food was great. Dinning by the riverside is awesome. Overall authentic North Indian food. Can visit again
4
Had drinks and dinner for 3. nice location, next to river, watching the crowds pass by and many restaurants near by with wide variety of foods, Food was good had paraotas, chicken and fish dishes with beer. av costs 50-60 per
4
We were in Singapore for couple of years, we used to visit to this place frequently.
Ambience of this restaurant is incredible.
4
The food was good in a bustling part of Singapore, with great service even with our big table. Definitely will return and the food had great taste and we were never rushed which is always good.
3
Just about average food, we ordered paneer dish which was just okay. The seating is too cramped but the location is good.
3
Could have been better , we ordered two curries and one of that was very spicy . Quality of food was lacking . Service was very slow and not personal .
2
I have eaten in various Indian restaurants but this place is a total rip off for those who want to eat North Indian food. Because of the high rental, they dish out below average stuff at exorbitant prices. the price one pays is only to sit by the river and enjoy the ambiance
4
We went to Kinara eating joints recently. It is located on the banks of Singapore River, among many eating joints of different tastes. We are vegetarian so it was a big respite for us in boat quay area. We went for set lunch. The food was good and worth every penny. Highly recommended for Indian food in boat quay area
4
Dropped in for Lunch here with colleagues and was very pleasantly surprised!!!Lunchtimes they have set menus with 7 courses (read dishes) for an absolute steal!!! The portions look small but they are quite generous especially given there are 7 different ones on your plate. The quality of the food is outstanding too!!! Each dish was extremely delicious.Seriously good value for money and well worth a stop over - even if you're not on a tight budget don't let the low price of the food fool you - it's really good!!
3
Quite an expensive meal, but this is to be expected given the location. Some of the food we ordered from the menu was subsequently not available from the kitchen, although checking the bill we were still charged for it (as well as the items we ordered instead).The poppadoms were so soggy they were genuinely almost inedible.Apart from being a bit salty, the staters and main courses were actually pretty good.Service was a bit brusque.All in all, okay but could have been much better
4
Good service and real value for money. Aloo dish was delicious. Worth visiting. Soni thanks for the excellent service. Well recommend to family however for weekend must book in advance.
4
Great Indian Food and attentive staff located at Boat Quay on the Singapore River. A personal favorite, this restaurant is suitable for family and business dining.
4
my second fav indian restuarant. Karahi is very delicious. Nan is quite big I ordered just one piece and shared with my friend.
1
I've been here about 3-4 times now (unfortunately) with friends and family. I can assure you that the food is good. Of course it's pricey. But somehow my experience with these people has always been bad, mostly because of the service. The waiters are thick headed with ego. None of my simple requests have been met. They give u free papad but no water. Of course most people would buy drinks anyways, but after meals you sometimes just need a glass of water. And these bozos charge 3 dollars per a small 500 ml bottle, which is absurd when you can simply serve tap water for pretty much nothing. They refuse to accept their mistakes, confuse themselves with the orders which is just frustrating. I would highly recommend people to avoid this place. Mind you, I am saying this again. Food is good but the experience is ruine
3
I love Indian food and Kinara came recommended by a local. I thought the good was just so so and I did have a bit of a reaction to it which I don't typically encounter with this cuisine. The plus side is that the location is nice and the service attentive, but sadly, the negatives far outweighed the positives
4
This was my 4th time at Kinara. We were 8 of us and could not find a table next to riverside. We were seated inside near the kitchen. That worked to our advantage as all our food arrived pretty quickly. We tried Indian breads (tandoori roti, naan, missi roti, laccha paratha). All the rotis were good. In the gravy we tried Malai Kofta, Veg Jalfrezi and Kadhai Kumbh. The quantity was slightly less for the gravies. We decided to try Paneer chatpata gravy. It was very very tasty. We should have probably ordered it in the first place. In the starters we also ordered the paneer platter. It was well cooked. Probably it could have been presented better with slightly smaller paneer pieces. Once again we were satisfied with the quality of the food for the price that we paid. I will visit this place in future.
4
Great spot on the river at Boat Quay. Mains between $15~$25 which is fine. But charged $12 for a Pure blonde stubbie of beer which I thought was a little over the top.Food and service were excellent.View and atmosphere was amazing.Well worth a visit especially at night
4
when my kids who are big Tandoori chicken fans from India say this has the best tandoori chicken ,i believed it after checking out many claimants to this , by trying out all the Indian resturants in Singapore. They have Best location along the riverside with great view of the MARINA BAY hotel. Good kebabs, Best place to enjoy the tandoori with Kingfisher beer ( outside India), good baingan bharta and dal makhni. they have good people who remember you and your food choices. Their items are not spicy and you can see this evidently by the amount of non indian tourist who come for eating their Tandoori murga.Clean place and i love to go back again and again

We had made reservations for New Years Eve Dinner via a third party reservation app for this restaurant. At the time of placing the reservation there were no hitches. The first issue occurred the afternoon of the reservation wherein I was informed that they were not accepting reservations and all seating was to be done on first come first serve basis for that evening. Fair enough I said since it was bound to be a busy evening. We reached at 8:00 PM and noticed that there was already a sizable crowd awaiting seating. I enquired at the counter and was informed that a waiting of 1 hour was expected. The man at the counter wrote down my name and phone number and said he'd call me once our number was up. We decided to head to a nearby pub for drinks to kill time. After over an hour when we did not receive any phone calls, we decided to head back to be restaurant and check if a table was getting vacant soon. It seemed to us that the whole process of jotting down names and numbers was simply a ruse as we saw folks who were no where in the queue getting tables ahead of us. The man at he counter simply kept smiling and shrugging his shoulders as if to say "What can I do?"The manager also seemed indifferent to the whole affair. Suffice to say we decided to move on and headed elsewhere for our dinner. Sad that simply because the place is famous they choose to treat loyal customers in such a tawdry manner. Alas Kinara, you've lost a paying customer in this bloke and his family.

Visited this place for a team dinner with some European colleagues. The place is nice with good view of the river. We got a seat next to the harbour. Even on a weekday the place was crowded with both India as well as tourists of other nationalities.We requested for he dishes to be prepared with less spices to cater to our European friends needs and they were well served. The breads were very good. In terms of quality of food it was also good.Given the location of this restaurant it is normal that the average bill is slightly more compared to some other Indian restaurants in Little India. As the place is located in a crowded area it may not be very good for private dinner. For our purpose of team building, it was not a problem
4
Had a wander down boat quay and haggled a good deal from the staff trying to get you in, seems they will give you good discount at all the restaurants nearby...food was good, not amazing...beer much cheaper than hotels/other restaurants...
3
Food was good but i found it a bit bland for an indian taste, naan breads were good and crispy. Price was also on the higher size, definitely not a budjet restaurant
4
Dined here with family,very good ambience of the harbour.Service is excellent.Ordered Indian vegetarian.Black dal was very good,they can improve on their malai kofta and paneer tikka.The breads were very well made.Overall a good experience.

Been here last weekend with 3 oher friends and the bill was 200$ which I felt was very very over priced for the kind of food we had, its all priced for the kind of location it is in, food is very very very Average, there are annoying fans up there which kind of hit on your face and my papad literally flew away from my plate, we asked them to switch it off or either decrease the speed or stop rotations they said they can't do anything and at one point of time my head started aching for that sudden rush of air on to my head and ears!! Very annoying they can probly use different kind of fans when charging hell lot for the customers, quantity was ok for the dishes but no worth at allll, ambience is very Average we ordered rice and they forgot to get it and we had to remind them twice!I am not going back there again and would definitely not recommend this place, if its just for the view please go have a pizza or drinks in a much decent place!
2
When you pay $60 a head, you expect service, good food, and some spending on overheads to enjoy the ambience. There wasn't a fan in sight and Singapore is not just humid but on an average 30 Celsius. We sweated our pants out sitting on tables that were kept adjacent to the road on a probable 5 degree incline.waitresses were inattentive and seemed like they no longer wanted to when there. Food was below average in taste.I'd rather eat for $10 at a food court.God bless this place.
3
I had eaten here many years ago, on a business lunch when visiting Singapore. Passed it the other day walking in Boat Quay with he family, and sat outside by the river. It was the most popular restaurant; always a good sign, and full of Indian locals.The food was pretty good, but like many of us who are used to Indian restaurants being some of the cheapest, the bill was around SGD 200 with no more than a couple of beers and dinner for 3. A price closer to half that, would have been more appropriate. It is however Boat Quay, and you do have great views of Marina Sands and the water
3
Seemed to be a very popular restaurant and there was one table free. Unfortunately it meant that for the whole dining experience I was passively smoking. A guest at the restaurant next door was smoking about 20 centimetres from me and the smoke was continuously wafting around my head. Smoking is not permitted in restaurants in England so I personally found this difficult to handle.On the plus side the service was OK and prompt, although there was a slight error with the order which was quickly corrected. We found the food tasty and better than our local Indian restaurants.Be careful about which table you sit at
1
As we walked past Kinara, one of their staff aggressively and with warmth sold the place with the promise that taste and quality of food is unbeatable. On a warm Friday evening we were all set to enjoy a dinner by the beautiful river in Singapore! Unfortunately trouble started right away. All the warmth used to court us to the restaurant vanished with the staff not bothering taking our order even after 15 mins of waiting. Finally after about 30 mins of us having walked in our food arrived. In one word it was disaster. Paneer Tikka was not seasoned enough and had a tinge of sweetness to it! We had to request for lemon and chat masala to be able to somehow down it. Thought it must be one off and chugged along.We then ordered Alu Lababdar, Veg Jalfarezi and Dal Tadka. Each dish was an attempt to outdo the other in terms of disaster. When we called the waiter who had ushered us in to give feedback, he first started with saying you should have complained about the particular dish which you did not like immediately, When we pointed that every dish was bad, the waiter defended saying chef is out on leave and they have temporary chef in the kitchen! Is it our problem that they have staff issues? Why were they aggressively trying to bring in customers? The food for 3 costed us about 100 SGD. Evening we would like to forget in a hurry
3
I've tried most of the Indian restaurants in Clarke and Boat Quay. This is not on the top of the list. The chicken was a bit chewy and the food was salty. The Kashmir Naan was not filled with fruits and nuts like the competition.Mango lassie was nice. Service was good though. Waiter didn't mind separate bills for a large crowd.
5
We have dined at Kinara twice in the last month and enjoyed it immensely both times. The food is amazing with loads of flavour, friendly service and the manager Soni looked after our group very well both times we have been there. Without a doubt my favourite Indian food in Singapore and we look forward to making it a regular experience. Very reasonably priced and a great spot on the river at Boat Quay. Highly recommend
4
Delicious Indian food and good service in a restaurant overlooking the Bay. We sat upstairs on an outdoor terrace and had a good view of the city.
5
I visited Kinara on my recent business trip to Singapore. I really liked the great inside and outside seating at this place. Loved the Pakoras and stuffed Naan along with Mango lassi. Awesome ordering option via an ipad app.
4
I have been to this place many times and love the food served. I done office lunch as well at this place and everyone enjoyed the food even the visitors from other part of the world.
3
A friend from Norway was in town and he would like to try the North Indian food. Thus we brought him to The Kinara at Boat Quay. We had the Chicken tikka masala and prawn. Food was okay and service is good.
4
Visited Kinara at Boat Quay, after the offer of a free beer tempted me away from my normal Indian restaurant there. The restaurant was quiet so I had a very nice table by the water, the food was good, the service was quick and the views over the water and onto the light show from Marina Bay Sands Hotel was excellent.This is the same review as I wrote for Haldhi restaurant a few doors down because I ate there on the same trip and to be honest, I couldn't choose between them - very similar and very good
5
Two of my colleagues and I ate at Kinara as two of us were visiting Singapore and our resident friend knew the owner, Raj. We sat outside at boat quay and ordered a vegetarian platter, dal makahni, palak paneer some roti and a potato dish whose name escapes me. Only politeness prevented me from scoffing mine and everyone else's portion - the food was absolutely delicious.The service was friendly and prompt and it looks like one of the more popular restaurants on Boat Quay. Next time I'm in Singapore - I'll be back
5
I have now been to this restaurant twice, once during the grand pix weekend, and six months later when I took work colleagues back there for dinner. To my delight I found it was as good, if not better than I remembered. Even better, they weren't trying to pull the passing foot traffic in off the street like most other establishments at boat quayOver the 2 nights I had a large selection of dishes ( sorry can't recall the specific menu items now ! ) but suffice to say EVERYTHING we had was delicious !!!!My next visit to Singapore I will most definitely return for more.Â Surprised not to see more ratings for this excellent establishment
3
Though the food was quite average and so was the presentation but the good things were the location - we sat by the riverside so a nice view with a light breeze added to the mood! Mango lassi was good and not excessively sweet and the assorted bread basket had a good mix of bread varieties. Not a must go place but can try once in a while
3
Nothing really stood out about the food. There are plenty more knock your socks off Indian places here in Singapore. Service was good, food came on time. However, if you eat outside and want a nice view across the river, it's not a bad choice. It is very pricey, but what place along Boat Quay is not?
4
I went looking for a vegetarian restaurant and found Kinara close to the Orchard street. Kinara turned out to be a good find. We sampled traditional vegetarian fare. The food was very good. The quantity was decent for two. The service efficient. The ambience was also good. Meal for two costed SGD 25 (without drinks). I will definitely recommend it to anyone wanting to sample Indian fare
