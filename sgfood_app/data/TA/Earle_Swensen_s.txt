The menu for this restaurant is not as extensive as their sister restaurant, Swensens. Food is ok but price is more expensive the quantity lesser. Main course comes with a salad bar buffet which is bot too bad.

It was a semi buffet restaurant - order a main course and get a mini salad buffet as part of the meal.
Highly recommended for groups of friends, family and couples

It fares poorly compared to Swensen's, under the same parent company. The mains we tried "The Perfect Burger" (was satisfying) and the Sirloin Steak (somewhat pungent taste although I consume mutton and beef) was overall not value-for-money, although both comes with a free salad bar.Service although prompt will not be a pull factor for us to revisit as there are other dining establishment, as well as stores with good sundae or ice-cream at Vivocity

It’s a Sunday dinner with the kids. The place is quite empty. After waiting for a while at the entrance, no staff came to attend to us so we walked in a little to ‘show our presence’ but we were shoved by the staff who noticed us to go back to the entrance. Seriously, what is this?Menu wise the choices are not really that we have expected and we regretted not selecting what we want before entering. Nevertheless we still ordered what are available. Quality wise is satisfactory. Each main course comes with free helping of the salad bar which is free flow. The salad bar is really pathetic. Compared to others like Seasonal Salad and such, this is really a rip off. There is no soup and very few varieties. Similar to others, there are no free beverages except drinking water.Will not return anymore. The normal Swensen’s is much better.

I'm serious. This is most probably the worst restaurant in singapore. I could have had better food at the hawker centre across the road. Average price is around 35 per dish..When u pay for something at that range .. there should be some standard.It's really bad. Seriously..I felt very angry with the wasted time. Wasted money. I vowed never to step in to any Swenson or earl Swenson anymore

Any main dish could entitle you to the free flow salad bar .. but the main dish cost around 25$ and above haha.. but the salad bar choice was good! Went there on a quiet afternoon but I have to raise my hands for 3-5mins before the waitresss could attend me even tho they acknowledge me.. food war pricey but was presentable on the plate check out my photos :)

Was in town for a 10 day business trip and our local colleagues took us here for lunch. It was easily accessible via a skywalk to a mall. Since this was the first restaurant that our colleagues took us to, I think they really like this place. I however made a mistake and got the lunch special (Ratatouille) only because it included the salad bar and a drink and I primarily just wanted the salad bar (was cheaper this way). However, I probably should have ordered something else on the menu since I didn't really care for the Ratatouille

Bit like Sizzlers in Australia you order main meals with complimentary access to the salad bar. Salad Bar has mostly savory, no cakes or desserts which you buy separately.Some nice pasta, seafood and steak options. Clean, nice views near the waterfront and a good place to go with kids

Me and my husband had our first date in the restaurant and we went there again on our 2nd year anniversary and nothing has changed everything was still as perfect. The service was splendid as always and we were taken care by a very sweet girl from the ice cream bar, Eunice was her name. She came over to talk to us and we saw that the management really has taken care of their staff seeing their staff still as positive looking even after a huge crowd coming i

This is our first visit to Singapore, and our local friends invited us for a nice group dinner. They were thoughtful enough to make sure that they invited us to a halal restaurant since we're Muslim. Earle Swenson's was impressive. The menu was nice, bright, and varied. The ice creams /deserts looked to be their specialties, and the salad bar was nice and fresh with many choices. After dinner we ordered desert and shared a huge platter of mixed flavored ice cream. It was called the Earthquake and it was heavenly! Order it, you won't be disappointed!

We came for ice cream, but discovered Earle Swensons is slightly different to Swensons. As we hadn't had tea we discovered the yummy salad bar and also ordered off the menu. I had a seafood chowder in a bread roll. Was delicious. Staff were very friendly and courteous, midpriced not a cheap meal but not over priced. I would recommend, we went here after a day at universal studios. Right on the MRT, in the biggest shopping centre in Singapore

We went at dinner time, so there was a small queue. However it only took about 5 to 10 minutes before we were seated! The waiters were really friendly and helpful!For my main, I ordered "The Perfect Burger". For drinks, "Lychee Glacier", for dessert, "Chocolate Crunch".The burger is really nice, the meat was tender. For the drinks, I really recommend the "Lychee Glacier"!! You could taste the hint of Lychee in the raspberries, plus it is actual blended fruits! Really a yummy blend. Too many seeds though.As usual, Swensens' ice cream is yummy and rich!Definitely recommend people to come here. Although the price is slightly more expensive compared to the regular Swensens restaurants, the service is two times better and I can definitely feel a difference on the whole

As we had not been to a Swensen's for quite a while we thought that we would have an ice cream.There is no service culture in the place - totally lackadaisical. When we sat at a table, there were 2 servers 5M away at a 'work station' with no-one between us and them. They looked at use and did nothing - just chatting to each other. After a while, I went to them requesting a menu. Once delivered they left, then i had to hunt them down to place an ice cream order. Once the food was ordered, there was zero activity, after 20-25 minutes I approached a manager looking person, who went to check - he came back and advised it is being served there are a lot of ice cream orders. Within 2 minutes our order was delivered. When we got up to pay, I did note a few people in the restaurant, maybe 25% full, with about 1 in 5 have ice cream, others having meals. "A lot of ice cream orders - what a crock of ..."By the way once we got our ice cream, it was quite good

We chose this restaurant as our first choice was too busy and my husband (who was on crutches) needed to sit down.Food was mediocre, over-priced and kids meals were over-cooked! Service was not what I'd expect from a Singapore restaurant - tried to give us drinks we hadn't ordered, appeared reluctant to get my son another drink ("It's not free refill!") and was surprised that we were willing to pay for another for him, then went to THREE other tables before finally returning to us with the children's deserts. I had to stack plates before they realised we had finished, then had to ask for the desert menu and finally had to ask to order!!We couldn't get out of there quick enough......

Went there on the 2nd week of aug 2016, evening time around 6pm. Had to queue up for almost 25mins. Many diners were ahead of us. So if you want to dine for dinner, better start queuing early! Earl swensen's provides free flow of salad with any purchase of main course. They even provide kids set menu. Food was good. The meat like fish and chicken we ordered were slightly charred. Might be due to overwhelming of diners they had to cook. Overall, it was a very good family hang out in earl swensens.

This place's location might cause one to miss it while trolling around Vivo City looking for a place to eat. Although the inside in deep and wide, most people could not see this if they are just passing by. You could just make out the sign board and as the Earle is in cursive and the Swenson is small, just totally miss it and go having your meal else where

It was on my wife's birthday. The place is well design, kind of a romantic restaurant. Free salad buffet with your main dish. The food tastes so good and their portions are quite ok, specially with the salad. The staff are friendly too, matching the restaurant style. The price is kinda high, but they are targeting a high class already. But still, I can find cheaper high class restaurants in Singapore. I definitely suggest others to go their. It is one of my best restaurants now

Had my dinner with my Wife and two kids 11 & 8. The price is a bit expensive, it is more expensive compared to Swensen's. For three mains I paid $116, no desert. Every main comes with salad buffet. The salad varieties is very limited. The service is good and they served the food in a reasonable time. The restaurant was not crowded, I was there around 9pm
5
Good service, good ambience, food was great and dessert especially. Good ambience, will Come here again. Price is reasonable. Overall great experience
4
I tried the poultry combo dish, it's one of their (mains) dishes which comes with a complementary salad buffet. I enjoyed the food and the view of Sentosa from restaurant window.
3
Food was nice. Loved their desserts. Kids totally loved the earthquake ice cream. However, portion sizes could be bigger.
5
the famous swensen brand of ice creams in singapore are always a treat they have many fantastic flavours
5
went here twice, beautiful food, not badly priced and the ice cream sundaes are the best, just loved it
5
Earle swensen's is the upscale version of Swensen's group. They have a all you can eat salad Buffet comes free with every main course you order. Sea food pasta is to die for. Love the atmosphere and got very friendly staff members.
4
Visited Earl Swensen for dinner. Some of the seats face Sentosa Island. Quiet environment on a Monday evening.Ordered a seafood spaghetti, it was tasty. Every main course comes with a complimentary salad buffet. Really enjoyed.Following ordered a dessert. The strawberry sherbet was really refreshing. Really enjoyed.Nice food, cosy environment at affordable price about $50 per person

I went on a date with my mom for dinner ! We ordered Duck Pasta, Seafood Baked Rice and coit tower ice cream. Everything tasted amazing. I had my first duck here haha. The main course came with free flow of buffet salad bar.. Bon Epotique
4
We ate lunch at Earl Swensen's at Vivo City and it was delicious. I got Chicken Baked with Rice and My man had Catfish and our appetizers was Tuna Quesadilla. Small problem, when I got my order first time, My man saw a small bug. Thanks to him, we returned it right away. Of course I had to wait another cooking time but then, it was worth it since it really is good

My two friends brought me to Earles Swensen branch in JEM, Jurong for a treat. As a family we used to patronize the Swensens branch in Causeway Point for its burgers and ice cream. I heard that Earle's Swensen has a much expanded menu. Aside from the main dishes which Swensen is known for it also has a salad bar. There are a lot of items in the salad bar but somehow when you mix them together it just tastes average. I orderd a tuna pasta which was just OK. I guess the menu here is slightly pricier than Swensens
4
I was very much impressed with this place and their salad offerings. This place is little expensive. However, the salad bar is a must try.
4
Good variety of various dishes are in the menu to meet your choice.
Before rounding up your meal you are spoilt for choice with all sorts of ice cream on the menu.
A good family restaurant.

This is the slowest service I have ever enclosed in any of the Earle Swensen branches. Placed an order around 5.45 pm and waited for an hour for the food to be arrived, with a strong reminder to the manager.After the main course, requested for the ice cream. Never come after 15 mind wait. Finally decided to cancel the ice cream and pay for the bill.The only good service they provided is absorbed the 10% service charge with very fast and excellent service in collecting the money.Will never patron this chain

I have long been a fan of Swensens in Singapore. Earl Swensens is the up-market version. A little pricey but the ice-cream is good just the same.They offer a great variety of food from steaks to pasta and a variety of food for the children and then of course comes the dessert favourites. Topless 5 - basically 5 scoops of different flavours with nothing else on them......Service is always good with lots of friendly smiles

Earle Swensen's is postured as a more upmarket version of the family-friendly Swensen's chain, and I had previously had a fairly pleasant dining experience at the Changi Airport outlet before it closed. So recently, we decided to revisit the restaurant at VivoCity for a belated Mother's Day celebration. In general, we encountered a decent quality of food. While prices were relatively expensive, there was a good variety of dishes, reasonable (to large-ish) portions, and all mains came with unlimited visits to the salad bar. Being there on a weekend, the restaurant did fill quickly with the dinner crowd. There was also an unusually large number of excited young children around so unfortunately, the noise level was rather high and that affected the atmosphere for us somewhat. Otherwise, we felt that our overall experience was decent

The Sirloin steak was very good and moist. My friend order Pan seared salmon, but i like the steak better. They have a various selection of salad at the salad bar.I have the cheesecake cookies ice cream which also very good.Delicious food, but the service is not so satisfying. We even had to ask more than twice for everything that we need, such as spoon, fork, tissue and also the bill.I think, maybe they don't have enough number of staffs

In preparation for the xmas day,my friend and I went for a xmas shopping in Vivo and decided to dine in at this restaurant.Been here for the third time, i was satisfied fwith the two visit so this is the first choice i had at that time. We had a salad buffet and a wagyu steak. The steak has been served after 30minutes which i acceptable and we were informed prior so while waiting for the main course we had a salad buffet.Perhaps it is near closing time (920pm) that selection at the salad counter is only few and most of the food items are empty.Nevertheless, the spirit of christmas was not felt with the ambience but the staff who took my signature for the payment did wished us a merry xmas
5
Had one of their interesting steaks (can't remember which, a few months' time lapse)Dessert seems very attractive. I had the lychee raspberry drink - it was the most heavenly drink I ever had in Singapore! They have a few other similar drinks too!Salar bar was of lower quality compared to high quality of everything else in this restaurant. But otherwise, fabulous. Seaview and you can see Sentosa, too

I dined with my family and order 1 kid's meal, 1 spaghetti, a cod fish and 1 salad buffet. The kid's meal was ok. Spaghetti was not as tasty as it should be. The flavoring wasn't rich enough.The cod fish was nicely done but it was in a very small portion. The taste doesn't worth the price at $35 for such a small portion.Salad as usual with sufficient selection. Good sauce mix and selection.If not for the vouchers I had, I wouldn't want to dine at the place.For the next time, I will only go for the ice-cream. Again, I can get a better deal for ice-cream else where.Service is slow; need to remind few waiters to serve our very small cup of coke @ $4.!!!

I had eaten at the Changi Airport Earle Swensen's with family before it closed. It was an expensive but nagging experience. So-so food, including a small and mediocre salad bar, OK decor and service that could not begin to compete with (1) Swensens ice cream parlours which are ubiquitous in Bangkoki, nor with (2) almost as ubiquitous Sizzler restaurants in Bangkok. The fomer win on ice cream offerings, price and vibe, and the latter win on good salad bar, far better mains selection and value. The Changi outlet of Earle Swensen's is now closed. We had heard that the salad bar at thisw VivoCity outlet was larger and better. So when in the area, we decided to try it out.The dining room is nicely located, with view. However, we were here for dinner, and the darkness outside precluded any enjoyment of that view. Thus - the reader might consider coming here for lunch, looking in advance for luncheon promotions and visiting when a promotion might maximize potential value for individual diners' tastes.The menu is slightly better than the former menu when we visited the now-closed airport outlet. And, now, all mains entitle one to the salad bar. The three of us decided to share a burger and a club sandwich, with the third person ordering the (only) the salad bar. This protected us from having to deal with too much so-so food in the mains, while trying to get some taste and nutrition at the salad bar.Though larger than we remember for the now-closed airport outlet, this salad bar is hardly large. And the physical salad bar was not overly filled with serving dishes - suggesting that it had been designed for more offerings than were now presented to customers. In short - too much empty spaces, and too few offerings. The offerings themselves were generally extremely plain. A sadly small selection of fresh veggies, only 3 fruits, and extremely few specialty salads. A very small number of toppings and dressings completed the offering.We read that the two Sizzler outlets in Singapore have closed. We also read that they had far better salad bar, choice-quality-value in mains offerings, than Earle Swensen's. But that Sizzler Singapore could not begin to compare with Sizzler Singapore.My sense is that one should avoid this place. And, when in Bangkok, have a meal at Sizzler to get a better salad bar, and make a separate visit to Swensen's in Bangkok, probably on a separate occasion (no need to visit an ice cream place after the fruit and other dessert offerings in the Sizzler buffet). You'll then get a better salad bar, choice of mains {though Sizzler Bangkok is not known as a gourmet's heaven, one or more mains should serve you adequately}, separate ice cream experience, and far better vibe and value, from that combination than you can, apparently, currently get in Singapore
