English breakfast latte was the best drink in coffee bean. And most of the cafe was suitable to hang out with friend. Strongly recommended to visit

The staff is friendly here. I order Double Chocolate Ice Blended, size average, RM 15.90. It tastes very rich chocolate but the vanilla cream is too much for me.

This is a place to hang-out with friends for coffee or tea for the day and some desserts too. Well! WIFI available too.

This is for people who like size without quality.
Ordered a small latte. Huge glass of "coffee" tasting like warm milk.
One should not need to ask for an extra shot in a small size coffee.
Could not drink it. Left after one sip.

Ordered a medium latte, no foam. They asked flat white, I said like a flat white. What came was a flat white, small. Five cents more than a medium latte. So I asked for what I originally asked for, and thought I'd paid for, a medium flat white. I finally get that and a butter croissant from a short-tempered staff. First "meal" after a day and a half of traveling. Started getting stomach & bowel cramps an hour after eating here. They are with me to this day, don't know what the hell it is, but something bad in my gut that won't go away (truthfully, could have come from anywhere, but this was the only food and drink I've had other than bottled water). Maybe the bad ju-ju energy felt there?Anyway, coffee and croissant at least tasted good

Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf at IMMSipping away idle chit chat. Enjoying space that is comfortably yours. Downing your beverage of choice with serious talk or careless whispers. Priceless.Energized baristas in control. Masterminding your fix the way you like it. Amazing indulgence.Sweet comfort - cheesecake and tiramisu treats that delivers. Bites that's full of goodness. Great

It was actually the second time I had this terrible breakfast at Coffee Bean. Had my first experience at the Esplanade brunch, very much to my amusement. Wasn't amused the second time round though, this time at the IMM branch. The parents were insistent on a beautiful Sunday morning breakfast at good ol' Coffee Bean despite my multiple warnings the night before. Alas, we ended up at the said breakfast place and it felt nothing less than a repeating nightmare. I believe most of us had bad airplane food experiences before; well imagine airplane food being considered a delicacy compared to this breakfast. Description of food:Had the Eggs Ben and Ultimate set. Starting with the Eggs Ben, it was hollandaise sauce overload, probably to mask the hard-boiled egg rendition of eggs benedict. Stand aside nice oozing yellow centre of an egg benedict, Coffee bean only serves well cooked yolks! Powdery to add. The Ultimate set lives up to its name, in terms of notoriety. Coffee bean might have gotten a few tips from Ikea, with the sausage, round patty-ish thing, bacon and scrambled egg tasting like it came from the same horse. This is the kind of breakfast place that you bring someone to, hopefully to mess up his/her day. It certainly messed up mine. Do not, I emphasize, DO NOT ever bring a date to Coffee Bean for breakfast unless he/she has a forgiving sense of humour.Doubt my words? Please feel free to try it for yourself

Great service, lovely seating areas and atmosphere. As a group of five we had plenty of room at our table and the food was delicious. Not expensive and large serves with tall drinks. We brought a travel mug to help promote them as we were so impressed

(There's no selection for JEM branch so I'm writing it here) Waited a long time at an empty cashier counter trying to wave for attention. Nobody came. Waited at least 10 minutes. Ordered , nothing much to say about the service quality... The food was terrible. The photos look good. But the actual was rubbish. The salmon Wellington was horrible dry. The fish was cooked to death. It's like rubber. The pastry was abit burnt and very hard. Even difficult to cut with the knife. The mash potato was like stone lumps. Microwaved to death. Bad. Not worth $15.50 at all! The Virginia brownie was dry and stale. Kept breaking up when it was taken with a fork. Terrible cake for $6.50. Only consolation was the pure chocolate ice blended. Familiar taste. But not cheap over $8 for a large size. I would definitely NOT eat at Any coffee bean & leaf anymore. Only for drinks. Do not eat there. Bad food!! Makes airline cuisine taste like gourmet dishes!

A shop who is supposed to have a good coffee. The espresso macchiato is a real cappuccino. They must learn how to prepare and serve coffee, espresso, espresso macchiato...At the moment they are able to serve only muffin.... not bad for a shop called " the coffee bean"...
3
Helpful, pleasant staff.Sandwiches and drinks are nice. Poor, poor wifi connectivity !! Please upgrade

Stopped here for teas and coffees which were most welcome after walking quite way in the heat. A great selection of both teas and coffees to choose from. Nice atmosphere and pleasant staff.

I keep coming back here for their caramel macchiato. The best macchiato i have ever tasted. I always Order the biggest glass they have.
3
The Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf surprised us with their assortment of food both the variety and taste but the coffee was a little wanting. There are other places that are better close by.
4
Enjoyed the coffee and the breakfast choices at this chain. The Lox bagel and waffles wit bananas hit the spot and were very affordable options
5
At last I found a shop that seved espresso coffee. Unlike Starbucks, this coffee is nice. A long black is called an Americano. Also serves Tea and has a selection of cakes and light snacks. Prices are reasonable and drnks are large. I found one on Orchard rd, near Tanglin rd

i went to Coffee Bean and Tea Latte to redeem a voucher for a hot Tea Latte. The waitress asked me about English Morning Breakfast Tea Latte.I did not understand first. I just nodded my head and she gave me that. I shared that tea wih few friends as well. It was an amazing tea which i have never had before. I really liked the original flavor

While some of the breakfast food is quite enjoyable the coffee shop has no idea about brewed coffee, none whatsoever. The last time I went, which will be my last time, I threw my coffee in the bin stationed 2 steps outside of it, absolutely rotten.The first major issue- when they can't be bothered brewing a proper coffee they will try to pour 2 shots of espresso into a cup of hot water and not even ask you first. Of course it is not ok to give someone a random drink when you ask for something else. An Americano and a brewed coffee are 2 completely different drinks.Secondly, when I ask for a small drop of milk I don't want half a cup of milk which totally ruins the coffee and negates the purpose of a brewed coffee

The CBTL is a chain and therefore offers the comfort of familiarity and recipes that work - hence its success as a chain. However, the financial banking of chains means they should all be equally clean. This is probably the worst CBTL I have been to in Singapore - its narrow, has no couches, outdoor seating by a noisy road, and is pretty filthy inside. The food and drinks are great, but the coffee shop ambience for me was ruined by the filth in this location.

This is by far the most amazing cup of joe I have had. It is perfect. Their almond biscotti is amazing however I never had it with raisins cooked in. nonetheless it was delicious. Customer service i great and they service breakfast 24 hours a day

Dropped by, for a quick coffee after looking at few properties in the vicinity. Ordered my normal shot of Iced Latte and I presumed my friend like his too. Tempted to Tea cappucino but wasn't available. People are friendly and services was fast.

it's not easy to get halal food in Spore. Lucky us TCBTF is Sentosa is Halal & the best thing is FREE wifi!!!!

whenever I go to Singapore a visit to Coffee Bean at Forum is a must for me, the personnel even remembers me by Name.
The macchiato is great.

It's a kosher branch so they don't have any meat.
Superfriendly hard working staff. Opens at 7.
HAve eat in and take away (sandwiches comes with a small sallad)

I enjoyed having my breakfast at Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf while in Singapore. I loved the coffee and they had a nice selection of breakfast options. I especially liked the smoked salmon scramble. It was great to have an option other than Starbucks. Recommend!

We stopped here and enjoyed a nice coffee and cake break during a recent trip to Singapore. We quite enjoy Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf franchises and obviously the One Fullerton branch has a superb location right on Marina Bay, offering great views of the area. We usually order the Chai Latte, finding their version to be particularly good. No difference this time around. Our large Chai Latte (SG$6.80) was monstrous in size compared to drink orders in Hong Kong and tasted great. This was actually large enough for two people (rating 4.25 of 5) We also had a slice of carrot cake (SG$6) that was quite nice. Cake was a bit crumply in texture while we prefer soft and smooth. Icing was fine, not too sweet, overall a pretty good carrot cake (3.5 of 5), we'd order again. Overall, another good stop at a Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf branch in Singapore for Chai Latte drinks, one we are sure to repeat in the future

If you enjoy smooth, tasty lattes, you will definitely like The Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf. I have a Nespresso coffee machine at home and here I can get a similar style of coffee. (So if you love your Nespresso, try a cuppa here). Absolutely delicious. I like the Cappuccino best. If you order a latte, be warned, the Large size is huge! Like a pint! I had breakfast here recently and thoroughly enjoyed the scrambled eggs. I also tried a hot meal at the airport outlet of this chain. I wasn't expecting much from the chicken and mushroom pasta but it was surprisingly tasty and generous. On a previous trip, my boyfriend and I shared a slice of cheesecake and it was one of the best we've tried. The free wi-fi is also a big drawcard. Love it. Keep up the good work and I'll be back next time I'm in Singapore

Okay, overall great place. Good coffee and all. But I am most impressed with their Carrot cake, and so much so that feel like I need to review this so other's can see it for the Carrot cake lovers. I love Carrot cake, and had so many from so many place. Absolutely nothing like the one here. Heavenly. Delicious. Worth every dollar! I miss it already! And, this one I had few times at the Bras Basah MRT station location. It's right outside once you come out of the station

This is a cafe chain and we used the branch on Orchard Rd opposite the Orchard Hotel. We had elected to book Room Only knowing the abundance good breakfast options on Orchard Rd and not wanting to be tied to breakfast times or a single venue. The staff are at Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf are a pleasure even first thing in morning, the service is excellent, the cheesecake wonderful and the choice of teas extensive. They were more than happy to provide an additional plate and fork so that we could share the gigantic slices of cake we enjoyed for breakfast. There is complimentary Wifi which was a huge bonus since the hotel did not see fit to provide this so Orchard Hotel lost our breakfast revenue and their loss was Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf's gain. We visited two other branches of CBTL, one in a Mall on Orchard Road**** where I had possibly the worst cup of tea in my life. It was largely my own fault, I ordered iced tea but realised it was about to be made with milk so I intervened and asked for no milk. The lady at the counter then said something about "extra", I didn't actually understand what she said but took it to an extra charge for no milk, I thought it odd but couldn't be troubled to argue so smiled and nodded, she repeated the statement and I smiled and nodded again, no additional charge was requested however. It was only when I sipped the vile beverage that the reality dawned, the liquor for the iced tea was not made from bags but a concentrate expressed from a machine, she had kept asking me if I wanted extra tea concentrate since I was not having milk, the resulting drink was horrible, almost beyond belief, ididnt pursue the matter although i am sure they would have been more than willing to sort out a fresh cup, it was my fault besides which the brew had left me almost unable to speak! So we live and learn. We also had breakfast the CBTL at Changi Airport on our morning of departure. For casual breakfasts, beverages and snacks I thoroughly recommend Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf

If you are looking for a quick breakfast during shopping, stop here. The house coffee is rather weak but if you finish the meal of with a cappuccino, you won't be upset.For me, this is not a high street place. It is more a place to go and chat. Mix a little with the locals.Good place overall
