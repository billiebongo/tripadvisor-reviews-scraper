Great food and great service, had the 4 course meal and everything was really good! We will definitely come back!!!!!!!!
5
Mainly set menus here for lunch and dinner, with a separate wine pairing add-on should you wish to. Food was good, oysters were fresh, service was good as well. An enjoyable experience.
5
Attentive friendly service. Good food recommendations by staff. Had the set dinner which was wonderful. Every dish was good. Highly recommend. Wine choices a little pricey though.
5
It was a fantastic lunch for me and my girlfriend. The staff were attentive and friendly. I surely come back to try other dish.

Good food but no standard for service and disappointment for birthday. Once is enough to experience.
4
relaxed and cosy ambience.
The food is tasty and delicious.
Lastly the price is affordable
The service is relatively good
4
Good place for small groups. Ambience was ok but service was great! Parking can be an issue there and it is not very child or handicapped friendly as the step is too high and restaurant is pretty small.

I had for the set dinner menu. They started new dinner menu when I visited at restaurant. The ambience made me feel to comfortable and there were many new food to choose from. I asked for advice from staff while I was trying to choose the menu. She helped me choose my dinner with kind explanation.Soup made my appetite and I could feel the fresh and deep taste. I felt like a soup that mom made for me when I was young.The entr√©e was a terrine that the chef had made himself, and that flavor made me smile. The most difficult main course to choose. I chose veal and foie gras to feel the texture of various ingredients. As expected, my choice was right and the texture balance was fantastic. Finally with sweet dessert, I could spend my vacation in a pleasant place with kind service and delicious food.Thank you for the all of restaurant staffs

Went to Taratata as I received quite a good review on the food. It was indeed a nice meal (we had steak), but the experience was ordinary. So if you're looking for good food, should give this place a go but perhaps not really recommended for big celebration
2
The kitchen tried to do more than it had the flare or skill for and the result was very mediocre. The only dish that was good was the crab bisque which had an intense flavour. The sauce for the starter and the main course tasted the same, and tinned fruit (clementine) was used in the dish. I took the 4-course menu with wine pairing, but only three drinks were offered, with the "champagne" for the dessert being a very tiny glass. Water is charged extra. The quality of the food and the indifferent service was too low to justify the high price of the menu 70++ SGD, and the 70++ SGD wine pairing is certainly not worth it
5
The ambiance was great. Not too loud. Set meal was value for money for our wedding anniversary. Their beef was really well prepared with well rounded flavour.
5
Best meal of 5 restaurants we dined at during our stay in Singapore. Excellent cuisine--Le Canard Confit the best I've had. Delicious Strawberry Tart. Crusty bread.Professional and attentive service. Refined ambience.
4
Choose the set dinner, and a bottle of wine. Overall the food is enjoyable and nicely done. A bottle of their wine is reasonable.
4
Celebrated my bestie's birthday at this French restaurant. Totally love the soup and the foie gras starters. Absolutely delicious! Dinner set are good value for money, will definitely be back!
5
True fine dining, meaning less noise polution which you don't experience in most fine-dine restaurants in Singapore. The food is of decent portion and taste really good, with reasonable price.
5
Order the 4 course set n u will never go wrong. Service staff lack experience butThey r polite n can see they are trying. Keep it up!
5
Fresh, authentic French cuisineGood service and classy/cosy ambienceTwo suggestions:1. Service staff should explain the dishes (menu description is really quite brief)- helps better understand what we are eating. For that price I think it helps! 2. Use of wine glasses- different glasses for different wine
5
This restaurant is such a discovery for me and my husband. It's perfect in everything- the location (central area), the ambience, the service and definitly the food. Cosy atmosphere in warm lights, sexy music will set your mood for perfect dining experience. I would like to thank Grace and other ladies (unfortunately didn't get their names) for providing us extremely friendly service, that complimented our evening.We had 4 course meal with recommended wine. Every dish is simply a piece of art - amazing taste and beautiful presentation. Went there on Sunday evening, the place wasn't really busy, I would recommend it for romantic dinner.This place is a benchmark.Definitly will come there again
2
I vaguely have rather good impression of this pooplave when i dined here 1.5yrs ago. However, was really disappointed when i came bacck tonight with my gfs. The cod was very very dry, and almost fishy. Despite it was really a tiny piece, none of us took more than a bite. The duck coinfit was dry, suspected it was baked at high temperature and the coq vin was very salty. Spent almost $500 for 4 of us and was quite disappointed. Could think of much better restaurant to go to. Well, at least the complimentary bread was good - crusty on outside and soft inside
4
Taratata Bistrot's located at 35A Keong Saik Road It's a classic French restaurant with an excellent ambience. the food here is descent better than most French restaurants that I have visit, and The prices aren't unreasonable ,and The food that we ordered( escargot ,duck confit ,wagyu steak, cod fish, and onion soup) was well cooked, well-presented and nice portions too. Staff are very professional the service is excellent and very friendly and attentive. Would highly recommend. I love it that much, I will definitely come back
4
Happy with the cosy ambience and great service. The set lunch we had were good. Will definitely come back again.
4
They give a pretty good price for lunch set. With that price, the food were definitely worth the value. The downside is the service was a little bit slow.
5
Great service!! A little too fine dining for me considering it should have been a bistrot... but the food was very good and the service staff were VERY attentive.
5
At $38 per head, this is value for money. Serves in big portion and quality is good. Staffs was very attentive and food was serve pretty fast it was not slow although there was a comments that food was served being slow. Love their ambience too. Will definitely recommend to others and visit again.
4
Had lunch set @$38 which is value for money. Start with foie gras which didn't expect the serving portion was big at the price and the taste was yummy! Ordered duck confit and taste was superb as well- skin is crispy ;).But when come to dessert the trio was not able to compare to the main n starter which is a little disappointed and rather the restaurant just serve ice cream or maybe end with coffee or tea which is good enough!The overall experience was quite pleasant given the restaurant is not crowded at all maybe is lunch and a Sunday.The interior setup is like a bistro at France which is cosy - Nice !
4
At $75 per head, this is wonderful value for the quality and quantity served. The foie gras is definitely one of the best I have tasted. The pairing with the tart pastry and berries went so well. The Wagyu beef was ok. I think it has to do more with the cut and quality then the preparation. It was not as flavorful as others I have eaten. We had a carafe of the Pinot noir and it was just ok. Smooth but lacking in body. Service was attentive but maybe the staff were not experienced. They walked up and down, past our tables but they didn't top up our wine glasses. We had to do it ourselves except for 1 time. But they topped up the other table regularly. So we will pretty puzzled. Will definitely visit again. Tip: pls make a reservation if you are going slightly later (say 8pm). We were there at 7pm and there were ample seats, but they had to turn away and make walk in guest wait after 8pm on a Friday.

Brought my friend there for her birthday lunch treat. Food, ambience and service was lovely. In my chope booking, I mentioned it was my friend's birthday, and they made the effort to put a candle and a "happy birthday" tag on my friend's dessert. That was very kind of them. I definitely think it is great value for the type and quality of food we were served. We felt just a little "rushed" occasionally, though I think that is quite understandable as it is lunch service, and we only went at 1.30pm. So take home lesson is that if you want a nice leisurely lunch, start your lunch earlier :)
4
Good friends. Good food. Good service. Good atmosphere. What else can I ask for? We had the 4 course set dinner. Crab soup was a delight with lots of crab (that's what my friends commented). The foie gras was was a hit with a good portion. The wagyu beef and duck confit were simply delicious. Service and atmosphere faultles
1
Ordered main courses only. Waitress said we should order starters because the mains will take 25min to arrive. I looked at the place it was empty, 3 tables. We declined, she insisted twice, almost forcing us.Then asked still or sparkling water, I asked for tap water. When later the tap water arrived we were told they charge 1$ fee for tap water ! We obviously made a scene and didnt pay.Many better (much better) french bistrots options in Singapore, don't waste your time her
5
We have had many many French meals in Singapore, and this would have to be one of the best.The decoration is very French, and transports you.The attentive staff were professional and did not hover too much.Our food was delectable. I enjoyed the Crab Bisque and my partner the Chatcuterie Platter which was generous in size, for starters.Then I had the Cod and Mussels and my partner the Rabbit. My only gripe would be we were not offered greens with our mains. Could not resist the Rhubarb Crumble with Strawberry ice cream.The courses were well spaced, we were not rushed.The restaurant was full on the night we dined so my advice would be to book to secure a table.Also, the French red was delectabl
5
The waitresses were so attentive, polite and helpful. The food were fresh and of superb quality. Will definitely return for more fresh oysters and rib eye!
3
Service was good and staff took time to speak to customers. Pork rillettes were not bad, but fries tasted burnt and looked overcooked.
4
Great food Great Service. Restaurant was almost full with a few turnovers yet Elizabeth the manager and her Filipino colleague worked diligently. No slack in service at all!! Well done!
4
The restaurant gets busy after 7pm and they are under staff so takes awhile for our request to be attended to. Overall food is superb, service is not too bad and we like the ambience, it feels like Parisian really!
5
Good food and ambience with excellent service from hostess Elizabeth. The wine pairing was great and the dessert were superb which were not overly sweet. The pricing was reasonable and affordable and my family really enjoyed dining at this restaurant.
5
Run by chef owner for 7 years now. Good food, not an average bistrot menu. Onion soup is hearty, a real stuff. Crab salad with fresh tomato and citrus dancing in flavour. Pan seared foie gras on apple tartlette. Rare rump steak with black and green peppercorn rub served with french fries. Braised rabbit leg. Friendly staffs and service
4
we ordered the 5 course seasonal menu. from amuse bouche, appetizer and mains were exceptional. When it came to dessert, restaurant was good enough to plan a candle and happy birthday message on the dessert. However, the sweet medley desserts consist of 4 types of desserts were generally too sweet. each dessert was sweeter and sweeter, which i think could do better.
4
Okay, what can I say...this restaurant is seriously very good but not quite yet superb for reasons which I shall explain below. The foie gras which my wife ordered was probably the best I have had in Singapore. The duck confit was excellent and well delivered. I had the seasonal special rabbit leg which was ..well.. okay. Unlike those I hv had overseas, this rabbit dish did not hv any 'gamey' taste or texture. The spice was quite strong. As a result, I could not tell the rabbit from chicken so the 'exotic-ness' was lost, unfortunately. Dessert portions are huge. For local Singaporeans, its better to share one. We didnt know so we ordered one each. The pear tart that my wife had was beautifully executed. My creme brulee was very good as well.And the pinot noir .... perfect.If not for the slightly disappointing rabbit leg, i wld hv given five stars.But i may well return to try the other classics
5
Fantastic for a traditional, tasty french meals! Menu is offering very wide selection of french specialities and we tried around 25% of it and it's just fabulous! Snails are the best in town and would be difficult to beat it. I always take this as a benchmark, the chef, Bertrand (great person - a baby cinquantenaire :) is cooking to the perfection using very high quality of butter, and the surprising piment d'espelette (IGP)! St Marcelin is a sin, with his truffle hint. Veal kidney is mastered, the mustard sauce with a strong pepper hint is a must for pepper lovers. The coq au vin, my other benchmark is good. Just need some adjustments as the sauce a bit too watery, but not far from perfection. The chef promised me to improve as he agrees that my benchmark from another restaurant is the best. So sad that the other restaurant pull it out from his menu. But thanks to this i discover a better place, Taratata bistrot ! Wine selection is also great, it goes beyond the traditional and known castles and reasonably priced for the region. No really, this place is my favorite French restaurant in Singapore. How come being there 10 years and I missed this home? Taratata will become my reference to introduce French delicacies to all my Asian friends. Thanks a lot to Bertrand and his Singaporean wife Elisa for their professional and friendly attention. Their assistant chefs are well trained and in a very good hands with this chef! Will come back soon to my new home.

Food is amazing. Second time here and we really enjoyed the food. Has an extensive menu with a good variety of beefs; from Angus to Wagyu, tenderloin to flank and tartare - thumbs up for quality. Awesome spread of 15 different farm cheeses. Warm and professional service too. Atmosphere is cosy and authentically French
4
Restaurant is nice ..ambience is very good ,,
food was good ,and service was good ..
wine collection is Really amazing
menu got quite good variety
4
Standard French Bistro food
Reasonable Value For money If You Hey The set meals ($60 for dinner)
Desserts are a let down
3
Food is generous in portion but pricey. My duck confit is average but my family like their selection. Service is good. Set lunch is better value
4
This restaurant serves typical bistrot fare very competently and used a lot of high quality ingredients, many imported. For an informal but thoroughly pleasant evening it is highly recommended.
4
A strange choice perhaps but we love the food and authenticity of the meals. A sample menu made large with the preparation and quality ingredients.
The staff are not French, though the owner is.
Price are on the higher side.
5
Dinner reservations at the recommendation of a friend took us to Chinatown in a quaint French bistro. I was craving a good steak and it turned out to be THE best steak ever. Kudos to the chef.

I really wanted this to be a good experience. A decent wine list, lovely atmosphere and music taking me to France- Such a pity about the uneven food which swung from delightful to disastrous, especially when it is a special seasonal 5-course set menu.The warm fluffy bread was good, and went well with the butter provided. The Provencal crayfish soup, aioli and over-grilled country bread was the first course. It was delicious to the last sip and left me wishing for a bigger portion, hence I reckon it would be delightful if this is offered as an a la carte choice on the main menu. The poached white Touraine asparagus with lemon-scented mousseline sauce was jarring, because the asparagus was sizeable but soft bordering on mushy, indicating the asparagus had been overcooked or came from a can.The third course of pan-fried foie gras in an unoffensive apple-raisin sauce could not be faulted, and was a nicely-sized portion. This dish was decent but not memorable, unless something is altered to make the foie gras and/or the sauce memorable.My companion had the baked pollack fish with sauteed baby squids and morels stewed in a lightly-creamed lobster sauce reduction. The presentation was not appealing. She found the sauce a tad too heavy and rich. I had the black angus beef tenderloin with morels mushroom sauce and mashed potatoes with truffle. The beef was cooked tending to medium rather than medium-rare, and the sauce oddly contained a mild sourness and tartness which did not compliment the meat. Furthermore, the meat was oddly tasteless, which made me question its quality when I know of at least one western stall in a hawker centre here, which could do better with their cuts of meat. After the asparagus being a let-down, this was even worse. The cheese selection is small, the 3 mildest cheeses chosen were unobtrusive, and definitely not worth repeating. My companion had the sweet medley dessert, whereby the lava chocolate cake was too hard, and the rest of the desserts was also mediocre and forgettable. If you're not paying and it was not a special occasion, you might consider returning after such an experience, preferably during lunch for more friendly prices (if this is the quality of cooking expected). If you were paying for this experience, 1 star might be given instead of 2. Given the French restaurants available in Singapore within the same area eg Rhubarb at Duxton, and Nicolas le Restaurant in Teck Lim Road, I might prefer to go to those options instead, or I might stick to my beliefs that to find good traditional and/or innovative French food (which is not easy here) not over-priced in South-east Asia, Hong Kong is a much better option than Singapore

I am a French gourmet and I would say that this restaurant is the best deal in Singapore if you want to eat very good French cuisine in a typical place. You feel like you are in Paris. The week-end dinner set menu is exceptional : 4 courses + dessert for only 70 S$, including foie gras, seared scallops, crab soup etc ... Everything was just perfect, even the seasoning. Apart from the set menu, they also offer a "√† la caete" menu with "boeuf bourguignon", "blanquette de veau" etc ... The only dish that we did not like so far is the "steack tartare". We have been eating there for dinner 4 times and we recommend this restaurant to every people who want to eat French food and do not want to spend 300 S$/person
4
It's a small, authentic French bistro with good food and service.We went with friends (including a French friend) and we all enjoyed the food.Unfortunately some items on the menu were not available, maybe because it was a public holiday. The chef sent us complimentary escargot. The escargot, cod, Atlantic salmon, cote de boeuf were all delicious. The chef came and spoke with us about where he sourced the produce. Wines were also great!A very enjoyable night
4
Had dinner for the first time on Friday and the food was very good! It was a trip to France! The place looks great, the music is good and the waitresses did a great job! I am happy to say that for once it was real bread with the foie gras and it was a delicious bread, which is hard to find in some high class restaurant in Singapore. And the size of the Foie gras was very reasonable! Being French I am very picky when it comes to these 2 items- bread and foie gras!!! hahah
5
We booked our Christmas eve dinner and were pleasantly attended to by the friendly staff. Cosy and romantic ambience. The set menu was delicious. Compliments to the chef. Will definitely be back
3
We had the set lunch and ordered the steakto be cooked to medium. turned out rather tough and my guest ate only half of it.
5
Food selection was great, Chef was friendly, authentic! Cozy place. Service staff were very attentive!
1
This used to be a very good bistro and I have eaten there many times over the years but the food we had there last night was most disappointing. Wagyu was served very well done when we asked for medium rare and the waitress argued that is how it should be served. Duck arrived without its garnish potatoes, which eventually appeared 20 minutes later, once my duck was cold and tough. The cod was disappointing. There was a fly crawling all over the cheese when it was presented to us and it didn't seem to phase out waitress, who was very pleasant but clueless. She insisted we order the desserts before even starting our dinner... Starters were just ok, dessert was quite bad. I was very embarrassed as I had guests there with me. Never shall I return again. There are so many very good French restaurants in singapore. This is one is no longer one of them
5
Was delighted that I found this little treasure. I have been missing French cuisine for some months now. We were a group of four friends catching up over dinner and clearly we were not disappointed; the food throughout the evening was nothing short of excellent. The dishes were very well seasoned and cooked perfectly. The interior is also worth the mention as it is comfortably cosy, warm and captivating. Many beautiful black and white photos of France adorned the walls. The Chef was really friendly too as he stopped by our table briefly to check on the food after our meal
5
If you want to looking for classic French style restaurant, this is the place to go.I was very impressed with the food the first visit this restaurant.The food is done nicely with fresh ingredients, tastes are good balanced and delightfully plated. They have an delicious homemade terrine, cheese platter, wine and desserts.This restaurant mood was beautiful and I've felt like I'm in France.Also, there were friendly service staff and nice French chef.After spend good time with my friend, she said wants to visit here again
2
I judged the food quality of the restaurant by dessert and I must say the creme brulee was beyond words of poor. The only reason of 2 rating is because the french onion soup was the only item worth the price.In melting pot of Singapore, I simply have too many choices that offers way above quality for the price we paid.Food was simply mediocre. Service is considerably polite but not anywhere personable, and it was tough getting help, proper cutleries in my opinion was often not provided or observed. I did put that it was my daughter's birthday but it was not brought up. Non eventful, borderline poor food really made me felt I have painstakingly chose this place for such occasion. Perhaps it's for casual .. so folks.. if you absolutely have nothing else to choose and have alot of money to burn, this is the place
4
We went the with 3 other friends. The decor and atmosphere are those of a brasserie in France. We all took the 50++menu for 3 courses and it way amazing!! Super tasty and French authentic foods, portion are huge and variety is great. A highly recommended restaurant for a gastronomic experience without fuss!
4
When I arrived for lunch during the weekend, there wasn't much people in the restaurant. Seating was slightly cramped for my liking, but the ambience was pretty french no doubt. Wine list was not too extensive for a french restaurant, but was sufficient and of good value. Service was impeccable, and the waitress were very helpful with the menu and also quick with refilling of water, clearing of plates etc. Between courses, the wait wasn't long (unlike in traditional french restaurants) and allowed for time for diner to eat at a comfortable pace. Overall, would rate it amongst the better value french restaurants in Singapore
4
We happened to chance upon this French bistro whilst visiting Keong Seok street.Keong Seok street is a row of pre-WW2 shophouses near Chinatown.We had a light drink on its outdoor seating (limited to 2 tables only). The restaurant sells wine by carafe which makes it very reasonably priced and also allow us to taste different wine in the restaurant. The price ranges from S$50+ for a carafe. The wine list was decent and the wines were unique and price very reasonably.We are told that the restaurant is operated by 2 French chefs who had been worked in hotel chains. The food was fabulously French and was unexpectedly very good for a restaurant or a bistro in a shophouse. Set menu are priced at S$38-47 for a 3 course meal with French onion, foei gras, mussels etc. Dessert cream br√ªl√©e was again outstanding.In all, this was as reasonable priced French food in expensive Singapore.Great experience on a great discovery
4
Had lunch in this warm small cosy outlet, good food & resaonably priced, attentive staff. Had the Duck Confit, Pan Fried Foie Gras
5
Had a fabulous dinner with my colleagues. Food is great, ambience is superb, and of course service attentive and good!
4
In Keong Siak road in the old shophouses nostalgia of Singapore you can enjoy the French ambience that you experience in Montmarte that I did.We had the mixed meat and cheese platters as starter and it really was superb with dark Erdinger.The escargot was abit hard but was oozing with garlic and olive oil.The rich red wine chicken was stewed for hours as you can taste the deep flavour of wine with every bite.The confit was too dry so it was disappointing.Best was the steak well marinated and done medium rare and it was juicy and tender.It was a delightful 21st birthday and the bill amounted to S$256 for 3 pax
3
Came for my birthday lunch. Setting is cosy and service staff were welcoming. But...Onion soup lacked lustre - plenty of onions, nice brown colour but lacked depth of taste for me. I usually don't add salt or pepper to my soups but I had to in this instance. Unfortunately it didn't help much to boost flavour for my palate.The braised pork drumstick took me by surprise - one bite of the salty meat put me off. I found out later it was cured, and I have eaten cured meats before, but it was way too salty for my palate - quite overpowering. I requested a change, which they did willingly. The Chicken simmered in wine was much better ! But the portion was rather small. However it was very flavourful and the meat came off the bone easily. If only the soup had body like that.My friend's duck confit was also rather salty. She enjoyed the crispy skin however. Overall, she left quite a bit of the meat on her plate when they took it away. The lava cake was fine. I had the apple crumble, which they kindly changed the accompanying ice cream to a sorbet for me. The sorbet was nice. But I found the crumble quite hard. Service was good - i felt well looked after by the service staff. But ultimately, we come to eat and hope for delicious food. Sorry, but will not be returning very soon
4
My gal friend brought me to this restaurant for my birthday celebration. It is rather accessible as it is close to the train station and bus stop as well. Ambience of the restaurant is very cosy. The promotion set menu of 1 for 1 is value for money and service was acceptable. I'll still go back to this restaurant again
2
The place has a nice atmosphere but apart from that, everything was rather disappointing. There are only 2 main fish courses on the menu and if you don't want 'moules frites' and the cod was not available. The 'frites' were good, the 'moules' too small and not very tasty. We had asked if they were any good since it's not really the season, but were assured they would be excellent. Not so... We had two glasses of wine, of which the red was good but the chardonnay tasteless. Hugely overpriced as well, at 17 dollars for a small glass. The service was as disappointing as the meal. One clearly a trainee -which is fine but do teach someone!- the other also not very professional, giving us thumbs up at every order. Literally
5
LocationThe restaurant is in Keong Saik Road, very near to the Outram MRT and nearby Chinatown. This street has a lot of character and also still retains its old flavour. I especially like the old buildings around. The bistrot is made to look like one on Parisian streets. The moment you enter the restaurant, there is a strong French feeling to it.FoodTo speak the truth, I do not know why some of the reviewers find the food so so, but I think it is authentic and tasty. I seem to enjoy everything they whip up in this little cosy joint. I love the steak and also the mussels dishes. The dessert is also very good. I love the creme brulee.Price$$ out of 5. I think in terms of ambience, quality, the price they are charging is way happy enough for me
3
We loved the plate glass window and the decor, which added to the Parisien charm. Service was also okay, though the two lady servers kept asking on different occassions if we wanted wine or coffee or tea.We started with mushroom soup. I liked it though my wife thought it was over salted. The mushroom taste was good and it was not too diluted. We both went for Angus beef as our mains, but found the meat to be a little tough. It also seemed to have been flattened quite a bit, and the number of french fries were quite sad. But the brandy sauce was excellent, and left me wishing for more fries to soak it up.Dessert was creme brulee, which I enjoyed. I loved the 'crack' when you first use the spoon to tap on the top - the mark that the dessert is done well.Overall, it was an okay experience, though not as outstanding as I would have expected from reading all the pre ious re iews
2
Service was bad. Had a birthday celebration and arranged for something special at the point of booking and even got a reply that something special would be done to the dessert. However, they had totally forgot about it though once seated, I indicated to them who was the friend celebrating birthday as requested in their email. I had to remind them when only normal desserts had been served without a candle and our friend was then served an ice-cream reluctantly. Birthday celebration experience was not up to expectation as mentioned in SG Tatler. Water was served only once at the start and we had to keep asking for water refill the whole night but only to get it refilled with less than half a glass each time. The lady manager on duty was also unfriendly and not service-oriented when we requested for her service. Recommended food in SG Tatler required acquired taste and not all that tasty, especially the air dried duck. Beef flank was only a small portion and french fries to go with it was not stated on the menu and was not changeable for something that my friend and I could eat. Dining experience was overall unpleasant
4
Delicious food. Yummy. We enjoyed the French dishes. Western food is usually not that great in Singapore (believe it or not). The chef is a French. The ladies who are servicing are very nice and friendly. They are not super professional but they make it up with their prompt service and nice service. Thanks for a nice evening
4
We love this little bistrot close to China Town. Food is good, classic French fair and reasonably priced. Don"t miss their French Onion soup and Escargots. It"s a nice spot for either lunch or dinner.
4
We went for the 1-1 set which was really value for money. However, even without the 1-1, a 4-course set meal (soup, appetiser, main course and dessert) at $68 is very reasonable for a French meal. The onion soup was flavourful without being salty though the lobster soup was nothing to shout about. The beef stew had a really rich wine sauce and for once, we could actually taste the wine ; ) In addition, the beef was tender, which is rare. The other beef dish, the beef flank, was OK - average. The desserts were however on the sweet side and we both have sweet tooth - chocolate lava and baked pear crumble. The other thing I didn't like was that I felt a bit pressurised to order wine. We were asked twice if we wanted wine, and we had to ask twice for water. My husband does not drink alcohol and while I can drink alcohol, it is not exactly my cup of tea. Waitress should not assume that everyone who visits a French restaurant would order wine
4
Nice ambience. Very cosy. Feels like I am in France. Delicious 3 course set lunch at $19. The mushroom soup was creamy but not too thick. Beef Steak was a tad thin but cooked well. Salad was well seasoned and fries were nice and chunky. Creme br√ªl√©e was fantastic! For $19, I feel it's very good deal.
3
Again we were excited to visit Taratata for date night and did so on a Sunday evening. We had reservations and we were quickly shown to our table, however thats when the fun stopped, I think I tried 5-6 different dishes on the menu to be told that they didn't have the dish, that they had run out of produce, one dish I can understand 5-6 is unacceptable for a restaurant that opens even on a Sunday!It will take a lot to persuade me to retur
3
Came here recently for lunch with a friend and we both opted for the 3 course set lunch at $35++. I had the lobster bisque to start with which was a little salty for my taste. The cod for mains was good and the chocolate lava cake for dessert was probably the best of all. Overall it was good but I wouldn't say exceptional. Relatively empty at lunchtime
3
the atmosphere created by its decor gave the place a French feel, including the very tight space between back-to-back seats. you could find the usual French bistro food offerings, like mussels and duck confit. service was slow, only 3 staff running around (including an intern looking girl who was not very competent)
4
If you like to have the experience of French Food in Singapore, you can go there. I cannot categorize it as one of the best restaurants in Singapore, but it is really good. You will have a nice lunch or dinner. However, the courses are done fast, it is not the 3 hours time you normally would need in a French restaurant. The staff is friendly, the restaurant is clean. We can recommend

Being Restaurant Week (19-26 Mar 2016), we decided 2 treat ourselves to yummy French food at affordable prices. The food was good, ambience and staff were great. Specially like the escargot casserole appetiser and the dessert. Kudos to the chefs for a most pleasing food presentation! So delicately and superbly done. We were a tart disappointed with the side French loaf as it came with butter instead of olive oil. Main courses of pan fried tuna was pretty ordinary while the belly pork was on the saltish side. However, overall, we had a good feast and can't really fault their beautiful presentations! Will definitely go back

I visited it during the Restaurant Week campaign and will visit again during a standard day to see if there is a difference and then making another review accordingly.It was a pre-set 3 course dinner options type. I had the escargot casserole as appetizer. Would have preferred the traditional garlic and herb though. Main was steak but a tad too thinly sliced. Presentation could have been more visually appetizing. Dessert was pear tart and my favourite out of the 3 course.Overall, nice cozy bistro ambience type. Service was pretty good with ample servers. As mentioned, not fair to judge them on a once off during a campaign week, so will be back to sample the ala-carte

We were a family of 4 - looking to celebrate a birthday at Taratata Bistrot. The food was average and many things were missing from the menu. The wait staff were supportive and attentive. Over 6 things were missing / out of stock on the menu - considering it's a normal work week. The staff were pleasant and the general service was good. Food was average and the dessert was good
5
Set lunch was very worth it. 3 course set was less than $40. French onion soup was sumptuous and lovely. Flank steak was spot on and cod fish was light. Dessert was a generous portion of home made lava cake with ice cream.

Was looking for a Chinese restaurant around Keong siak street but it was closed so we wondered around. Saw this restaurant amongst others and was not crowded so took a chance to venture to try this French bistro. There were set menus priced reasonably well. And we ordered the 4 dishes. Soup starters and main dishes were ok. The desserts in my opinion were the best. Nothing to shout about at the restaurant and seems like there were not many trained service staff as one was assigned to a larger dinner table that came later and the other was moving round helping with the others who were coming in. Overall was ok.

Taratata has been around for a while, I've been there many times for various occasions and it has never disappointed. Everything is very authentically French, from the decor, to to the specials board, to the cheese cart to the food and wine. Now they have the 3, 4 and 5-course menus at very reasonable prices (3-course for $35 for dinner) which you can't really get much better in Singapore for the quality and quantity of food. You can also order ala-carte. Everything on the menu is very good and you can't really go wrong with anything. The location is also great right in the middle of the hip Keong Saik Road. Highly recommend it

The only good thing about this place is the atmosphere and friendly staff. We had dinner on valentine's day and the food is not worth anywhere close to what it cost. The special valentine's menu sounds appetizing but it really isn't. Cod fish was cooked unevenly with one end tough and the other end decent. Beef wellington has soggy pastry that taste of nothing but tons of pepper. The worst part of this dinner is me waking up to food poisoning the next morning and the doctor suspected that the beef is the problem as i did not have any food that my girlfriend did not have except the beef on the previous day. I paid over 200 bucks for this dinner and what i got is a trip to the doctor and a day of agonizing pain throughout my body

For travelers or residents coming to Singapore from Europe, or lovers of French food, Taratata is a little slice of heaven. We went for Valentine's lunch and chose the special set menu. Every course was served beautifully, prepared flawlessly and tasted delicious. The wine choices were what you would expect in a good French bistro and the service was excellent! If you've ever complained about restaurant service in Singapore, you will welcome the discreet perfection of Taratata's servers. If not for the lion dance going on in the street, we might have been sitting in France. Absolutely perfect and we will be regular customers here.The menu has plenty to choose from and is good for families, business luncheons, romantic dinners or any other reason

This place was recommended to me as good value for money. I would somehow disagree. This is good food but it certainly comes at a price. The pluses: the d√É¬©cor that does remind of Parisian "Brasseries". The menu with two starters, one (very small) main course and a desert is a good choice. The tuna as a starter was particularly good. The bisque was not so good and the magret was very decent. As a main course the cod was good and the duck confit was also tasty. The presentation of the food was very good overall.Minuses: paper napkins do not work for me if I have to pay this price for eating. The wines are simply too expensive. If you drink red it will be over 20 SGD for a glass after taxes! So for the four of us - we had little food (2 deserts for four) and 2 glasses of wine + 2 glasses of beer - we paid 320 SGD -- There was no Bordeaux wine by the glass, and the manager was not flexible about this (I asked twice). The glass of Chinon I tried was really bad. The glass of Pommard was better. I would recommend the managers to use real napkins and to add a Bordeaux by the glass (there are ten Bordeaux by the bottle). Last but not least, adding an affordable red wine on the list would be welcome. I don't think there was one red wine much below 100 SGD a bottle if you include taxes etc

Setting of the place was great - very cozy and authentic, reminded me of my time back in France. We ordered the Lobster Bisque and French Onion Soup to start. The former was a little too creamy for our liking, but it was still delicious (could be just a personal preference thing), and the latter was excellent. We ordered the Pan Seared Cod with creamy vegetables and the Steak with Foie Gras, both were really good as well. Service staff was also attentive and very smiley. Thank you for the great dinner

We booked this restaurant from Australia for our Christmas Dinner and were not disappointed. The fixed Christmas menu was excellent, very French and most enjoyable. There were not many people dining so the atmosphere was quiet but pleasant. The staff were very attentive, helpful and always ready to assist. We really enjoyed our meal and afterwards had a long chat with one of the Chefs. We enjoyed our meal and went back later in the week for Sunday Brunch which was just as good a meal, the gallettes were excellent. We would thoroughly recommend this restaurant for its food and ambience. Well worth a visit

You expect good food from a French chef and it didn't disappoint. A 3-course dinner with several options on the menu was served during the Restaurant Week. A must try is the baked Escargots to start with. For the meat dish both the braised pork cheek and sirloin steak were very well cooked with a perfect texture and flavour, Dessert was quite ordinary though with a standard serving of ice cream and Chocolate Lava Tart. Wine by the glass ($10) was decent.It was a full house and a bit crowded in a small place, but a good overall dining experience with good values at $35++ for the set dinner
3
Went there using a Groupon, $27.50 instead of $45 for the 3 course set. I topped up $15 for the Tenderloin and Foie Gras but the Foie Gras too fatty, and the portions were tiny. Overall a mediocre meal but desserts of Creme Brulee and Pear Crumble was decent.
4
I've long been a fan of Taratata. The lunch sets are such a great value but I was craving their warm goat cheese salad. True to form, the muscles were perfect!
5
There food was very well prepared and was better than expected, enjoyed the whole experience of dining at this place.
5
The ambience is great for a catch up with old friends and food variety is much better now. I love the mushroom soup and escargot.
5
The food is amazing and the service was good. üëçüèªüëçüèªüëçüèª They always try to interact with the guest. Do make a reservation, the restaurant will be packed sometimes.

Wanted to go here many times before, but missed the opportunity. Going here was no disappointment and this place will be on my radar again for a next occasion.Very welcome and attentive service.My tournedos was done excellent. Rare the way it should be. I saw one of the reviewers commenting on the codfish, which may be tastes better when it is not fried. Anyway, my guest had no complaint on that. Choice of plates comprises of traditional french cuisine. Same with the deserts. I will come back
3
The decor and ambience was cosy. Appetisers such as escargo and mussels were fantastic! I ordered the codfish for my main course which was a total disappointment. It was overcooked and tough! The mushroom soup was too salty. As we were there to celebrate a good friend's birthday, the wait staff promised to place a candle on our dessert with 'happy birthday' written on the plate. But they failed to do so. Reason given to us was that the kitchen was too busy. It was such a disappointing experience.
4
This was a great find. I chanced upon this by accident and was impressed with the reviews. Visited their website and they were unpretentious. Prices were put upfront in their menus.When we entered, the host greeted us by name and acknowledged our request that was made during reservations. Wow! The bistrot had lovely French decor and theme too.Everything about the food was delish, from the simple baguette with butter, escargots, to the duck confit and steak that we had for mains. Desserts were mmm...you must try the chocolate (oozing) tart and warm pear crumble.Service was excellent. Thumbs up!! They gave you enough privacy to enjoy your evening, and yet they were attentive and knew when you refill your glasses or clear your tables etc.With reasonable pricing, coupled with great food and amazing service, we'll be back!Just one negative - location, as parking can be a problem even on weekdays. But this is not their fault, just a word of caution to drivers - to be patient :
5
This restaurant is a perfect French Bistrot which is serving really authentic French foods, I have to give them a Excellent with cleanliness, taste and generosity, and as well as the price are really mid range and not to expensive. We have eat in this restaurant many times and the thing is that we always come back here because of its really a French ambience and relax feelings, no pretentious but just authentic of all what it offers, I must agree, two French Chef are better than one!!! Bravo et Merci
5
We decided to have a lunch meeting with my colleagues and we walked in a perfect French ambience, really really good and tasty French foods, we ordered the traditional escargot and lobster bisque for appetizer, and tasted the finest duck confit, it's known as the French cassoulet and my favorite part when the waiter told us that two French chef, who both owner of this restaurant have been working meticulously to serve this authentic bistrot French foods! What awesomeness it is!!! We did not wait long to be serve but instead we finished our lunch meeting with a big treats! Merci beaucoup

The food was truly delicious and quite varied. The meat was well cooked, and the side dishes very tasty.The main problem was that we had to wait nearly two hours from when we arrived for our main dish to finally be served (appetizers had been served about 45 mn after we ordered. The waiting staff is not very efficient (refilling only one out of 4 water glasses, not bringing steak knives on time, not clearing plates). The kitchen is very slow: even though we were one of the first ones to arrive for lunch, we didn't get served until after a few tables who had arrived after us. So again, the food was really good, but it's still not worth it because it takes forever to arrive, and the service is poor. Another thing: the head waiter brought us a new basket of bread (we had finished the first one) without us asking, and never mentioned that the second basket wasn't free, so we had to pay for it at the end. A bit sneaky on their part, to be honest

A great dinner we had.. Escargot taste nice.. One of the staff name Zac have serve us well as he given us taste difference type of cheese... üëçüëçüëç
5
The food is amazing , everything is worth it ! Good service too . They always try to communicate with customers and also get to know them which is good
5
The food is awesome, service is good!
A very classical french bistro with french music!
Sometimes restaurant will be very packed, so make sure you make a reservation before heading down to avoid having to wait!
4
Very cozy restaurant. The food taste is very authentic and yummy with good size of serving . Nice presentation and attentive staff. The good sign is it seems always full, even just for brunch.
5
The Sirloin steak was grilled to perfection, tender and juicy. I also like the Pan Fried Cod Fish with it's white succulent meat that is fresh and springy. I will likely go back back for more. Nice warm french decoration that compliment the dinning experience.
5
Delicious food, nice wine, and friendly staff. And the portion is big. Thanks Chef!We also had different kinds of French cheese, thanks the friendly staff Zac, he is humor and brought lots of fun to us during dinner. I would like to say, we had a great dinning in Taratata last Friday night
3
Went here for lunch, and the place was full. Ordering a 3 course set, an obscene amount of food was served. For starters, the cold cut platter was huge. A serving could easily appease the appetites of 3 or 4 people. followed by the main which is the duck comfit. It was passable. Dessert was good, a molten chocolate cake with ice cream
5
The escargots were L O V E L Y!! It is a must try. The main course of pan fried cod fish was so mouth watering, the quality of food is really good for the price. The dining area has such a warm and cosy feeling.I was there with my partner, really enjoyed the evening there. The waiters were friendly. On the whole, the experience was great and would come back again
3
We had brunch here on a Sunday morning. Only 2 tables were occupied (1 of them by me and my friend). Maybe because there were so few people, service was very good and personal. Constant topping up of tea and water, asking how the food was etc. My friend had the crepe with mushroom and cheese, I had the croque Monsieur. I really wasn't expecting too much for my croque Monsieur (which is really a ham and cheese toastie) but it was better than expected, with lots of cheese and a side of romaine lettuce. My friend however, complained about the tea- for the price charged, they were only serving Lipton. The decor is very French-like and inviting. And although brunch wasn't expensive, it's not a place I'd associate with value. For the price paid, dishes were too simple. And if you want to do simple, it has to be hearty, but I can't really find it here.
5
The bistrot has a classic feel to dining in rustic France. More casual elegant feel to the ambience. Great for date night or dinner with friends when u wanna feel classy. Food was top of the game awesome. The Chacuterie had an excellent selection of cold meats. Snails were awesome. Their beef was just oh so melt in the mouth to die for. Takes us back to Jules Verne. Maitre'D chose an excellent Ros√É¬® for us. Was awesome for $68 bottle. Lasted thoughtout our entire sitting. Waiters were very attentive.. waited for table to finish meal before each course. I would definitely come back to this place!
2
Not one of the better places for food on Keong Saik Road- good backup option if the other restaurants are busy. French food was okay. Better French nearby is Brasserie Gavroche.
2
We visited this establishment in order to have a late night cheese board and wine. We were seated outside and told that they would see to us shortly. 15 minutes of ignorance later we left.
1
The chocolate lava cake says everything. Tough and curdy. The duck confit was hard and over-salty as well. Very disappointing food.
4
Had lunch there during restaurant week. It has become yearly affair. Service and ambiance were excellent as usual. 3-course meal at $25++ and wine by the glass was $10++. Great for friends and family.
4
Tried the 3 course set lunch. Food is nice though a bit salty for Singapore standard. Service is slow for lunch...eating the lunch took more than an hour. Smoke fish plater appetiser is nicely present. Duck confit has very crispy skin. Meat is slightly dry but not hard. Smash potato is smooth. Chocolate lava cake is warm and soft and goes very well with vallina ice cream. Good lunch
5
We (4) visited during restaurant week to take advantage of the special offer. We all had meals that were well cooked and satisfying. The restaurant week choice was a limited selection from the regular menu but everything was first class. The house Sauvignon Blanc was excellent
5
The regular menu and set menu has an extensive choice of starters and mains. I started with a home-made air dried duck breast platter, artfully presented. The duck breast flavour was delicate and sweet. Excellent dish!Next came the baked goat cheese salad, another great dish. For my main course I had the traditional French veal stew, the veal was served with small vegetables and rice on the side. The texture was a perfect balance between soft and al-dente. And finally a chocolate lava cake was the grand finale! Just excellent! The wine list also has an extensive choice with reasonable prices and the service was pleasant and professional.One of the best evenings in SingaporeLeonar
3
the food is quite good. i've had better for cheaper, though... if you go, do have the foie gras-- some very delicious bites there. the duck confit nothing to write home about. if there were a rating between average and very good (like good) i would select that... but i don't feel comfortable marking 'very good'

My wife and I tried out this quaint little French restaurant for our wedding anniversary dinner. It was a great reminder of our enchanting 2-week holiday to Provence a couple of years ago; everything was "so French" - the interior decor, songs and music, service by a French lady who came from Burgundy, and of course, the food. We each ordered a 3-course set ($45); I asked for escargot (of course!), and she had a tuna entre. For mains, I ordered a braised pork knuckle with cabbages; she had a halibut. My apple crumble was sinfully delicious. The wine was an exquisite merlot that's just nice; not too fruity. The ambience and music felt like a scene from the movie "A Good Year"; we enjoyed it thoroughly and would come back again on the right occasion. Definitely one of the better French meals we had in Singapore
3
I chose this place in Chinatown for Friday dinner because it was near my hotel and looked good. Without describing the whole meal in detail, I had the multi-course prix-fixe menu. I found the food very good, in fact good enough that I do recommend it to others. The issue I had that detracted from the otherwise high rating I would give htis place was that until I complained about it, the wait staff seemed almost manic as they buzzed around me whille I was eating, stopping bye and looking like they expected me to be finished and to take my plate every few minutes even though I am a slow eater who had just pretty much just started eating. This really irritated me because I enjoy eating slowly and savoring the experience. When the second course, a baked cheese with truffles arrived after I was only 1/3 of the way through the first course and it had to sit on the table getting cold while I ate the first course, that the maitre 'd (a different much more experienced person than the overly attentive waitress) stopped over to suggest that they keep it warm for me. Not very happy, I told her it would have been better if they had not prepared and served the second course yet at all and added tongue in cheek that if I was not eating quickly enough for them they should let me know and I would speed up. Anyway after my complaining I had plenty of time between courses and the experience improved greatly. I think I may have caused them to go a bit to the other extreme however as at the end of the meal I had to have another patron closer to the side of the restaurant where the waitresses were having a conversation to wave them down to get their attention so I could pay.Anyway in summary, the food at this restaurant was really good. I would definitely have rated the restaurant very good, possibly even excellent, if my experience with the service had not left me feeling rushed and ultimately left me not happy with the experience. I don't the restaurant needed my table, rather I think some of the wait staff just does not have enough experience to know the standard in service that is expected in a restaurant otherwise of quite a high caliber. I don't know if this is a common Singapore phenomenon or is more unique to this otherwise very recommendable restaurant

Everything is just right here.
I went twice and I will go back; it's pricey, but it is worth. Dishes are perfectly cooked, and the Mrs is a wine expert; just follow her advise.
5
We thoroughly enjoyed our dinner at Taratata Bistro. Delicious tasting authentic French cuisine. Good wine selection too. I especially liked the little booth seat we were in, private and cosy. One of the best evenings in Singapore.
4
Our first visit there and loved the atmosphere...
The 3 course set dinner was great and the service staff were friendly too!
Worth the visit and will return again...
5
Here for lunch. Excellent food, good wine list, good cheese selection. Very reasonable prices. Very nice ambience with excellent service. We were in and out within an hour. Just what we needed for lunch. Will be coming back to try their dinner and Sunday brunch.

I just had dinner last night with a girlfriend at taratata. Overall, their service was not up to my expectations. Shortly after we sat down, a big group of 12 came in. The place was full on a Wednesday evening. The set menu was ok but we went ala-carte. I have to admit that services was slow and the wait-staffs was not attentive for their standards. Food was passable, nothing in particular stood out. Our entr√©e did not arrived together and baguette was missing. Our main was late and they kept us waiting for sometime. When it came to desserts, I felt that my souffl√© was missing something. Then I realized it was missing the cream (the next day) so I came here to write a review. I was thinking to feedback to them directly but since I will be heading back to eat with them, I can order souffl√© again
4
Had a good meal at Taratata. Real french bistro style food with very good value for money. The lady that served is was super knowlegeable about the menu and food which was delicious. Good ambience , great for meetings and good value for money. A sure must try......
3
We had the 3 dishes menu and to be fair the starters (goat cheese salad) and the desserts were real good, but a lot could be said about the main... It must have been the smallest salmon fillet ever, and there was only about 3 spoons of mashed potatoes with the the chicken. So the mains were alright food-wise but honestly not that impressive and in too small portions for some of them!Then please chill out on the marketing techniques, not everyone wants to be offered "a bottle of plain or sparkling water ?", "an aperitif or a beer maybe?", finally "maybe you'd like a bottle of wine? No you don't like to drink over food ?"... I don't like having to say 'No' all night long.And finally, I know it's custom in Singapore, but for a FRENCH bistro, charging the bread servings 2$, and not mentioning it... Who charges for bread in France ?The value for money is good but the overall experience not that much
3
Located along Keong Saik Road, Taratata is certainly one place you would need to visit at least once in your lifetime. Especially loved the herb butter escargot, which came in a little dish of 6 morsels all nicely soaked in savoury herb butter. My wife and I both decided to have one dish each. When it comes to really delectable escargot, done in the right way, six is never enough. I was a tad disappointed with the braised pork knuckle on a bed of cabbage though. The taste seems somewhat reminiscent of the classic chinese pork trotter dish, with cabbage that tasted as though it was cooked in hoisin sauce or something close. And my wife was certainly expecting a slighly sizier flank steak, but hey, this is a Frenchy restaurant, isn't it? The saving grace of Taratata was probably their desserts. We had a really good lemon meringue tart with some tangy lemony sorbet and an apple crumble with rum and raisin ice-cream. While both were substantial and tasty, I personally would recommend the apple crumble over the other. The other great part about Taratata is its ambience. On the inside, the decor was truly well thought through to ensure that authentic French food is served with an authentic French feel.So, if you're looking for a to enjoy a lovely romantic dinner or just simply a place to far away from the madding crowd, Taratata can certainly offer you that
3
If you've been looking for the restaurant that serves good quality French cuisine, and set in the older quaint district, with menu prices that are not cheap, but fair for the quality of food, then this is the place for you. Here you can let your kids run wild, screaming and shouting is all part of the management concept of family dining. No need to feel for the couple who were out for a romantic meal about to pop that important question, but can't hear themselves think, no need to worry about those stares from those hosting business dinners who can't hold a conversation above the screaming. For an all round wild and noisy time with your kids this is the place for you. Two thumbs up for family friendly Frenc
4
There are so many options now in the Keong Saik area that trying yet another restaurant for the first time can almost become a chore. Taratata however occupies a very nice place in the burgeoning scene doing simple things very well.The food is honest, well cooked and the portions are good, service is also good and friendly.The wine list could do with a little more depth but overall you'll have a great meal here
3
The food was average but the portions tiny. The best thing served was dessert for the set lunch over Restaurant Week 2014.
3
I was there just for their French Onion Soup, a friend's recommendation. Truely it was an enjoyable dish. The service was average on a contrary. Authentic French Cuisine indeed.
5
Fantastic French bistro food. Not too complicated but tasty. Cold but efficient service. Fabulous price too. Great set dinner menu. Well done!
4
Good french traditional restaurant in Singapore. Food is quite nice and well prepared. just a slight comment as service is attentive but could be faster !
5
We happened upon this place and were not put off by the fairly high prices on the menu....it was our last night in Singapore and we were determined to eat in a real restaurant rather than a food court, no matter what the cost!!! The menu was enticing but our choices increased when we were shown the 3 course $S48 a head menu. Extensive choices for each course. I chose the goat cheese salad for starter and my partner had the pepper-encrusted salmon salad. Both delicious! We both had the sea bass with lemon butter and asparagus followed by the creme br√ªl√©e. Yum! Yum! Yum! Considering the delicious, fresh-baked baguette we demolished before our salads came, it really was a 4 course dinner. Worth every cent....in fact....good value. Service was pleasant, helpful and professional and the wine choices were nice (albeit expensive). A top restaurant and a great way to finish our international sojourn
4
Classic nice French bistro. Attententive service. They were patient and supportive with our request to share one tasting menu starters and dessert. French lady also nicely supported us to select wine for our taste and match with main courses.Highlights:  Baquette - tasty, nice crispy crust Braised rabbit leg - awesome soft nearly creamy with well balanced sauce Chante Coucou 2010 red wine from Elian Da Ros

I would say Taratata has remained under the radar of French restaurants in Singapore. We are spoilt for choice of French restaurants in Singapore, and the standard is generally pretty high, given most are French owned and operated. Taratata has an extensive menu of French classics. We enjoyed the food ‚Äì duck rillette, veal blanquette, coq au vin and chocolate fondant. Honestly, all the food coming out of the kitchen looked good. My only gripes are about the service and d√©cor. The service was slow. Our dishes came out briskly, but it took forever to catch the attention of the waiter. The place isn‚Äôt understaffed, but the servers just seem to run around acting busy and avoiding all eye contact. Another thing which really annoyed me was that the place was too bright. The lighting wasn‚Äôt romantic and didn‚Äôt do any favors to the atmosphere of the place. On a positive note, I did like that the place wasn‚Äôt overly pretentious like many others in Singapore, and that there were even kids dining here. That‚Äôs quite a rare sight in this city. All in all, this place has potential and I would be keen to try it again
2
Been to Taratata a couple of times. Past dining experiences were good. However last night our table of 4 were very very disappointed with the food. The duck confit was over done and dry, the tuna nicoise was under seasoned and bland, my starter which was described on the menu as crab avocado and celeriac was exactly that. Three dips of crab mayonnaise, avocado that was SO tart it was impossible to eat and plain celeriac served with thin toasted bread. Had all but 3 bites of it! The coq au vin was nothing memorable either. Thank goodness for the 3 bottles of wine, good company and cheerful banter.
3
In the past I have recommended and sent friends to this quaint little restaurant. Sadly last night was the third time, and just when we recommended and take friends we are let down on food (referring to entree)Salad nicoise was thrown together. It did not look nice. It did not taste nice. The crab entree was left untouched and sent back to the kitchen. The chef had a heavy lemon hand. Maybe its just the entree chef who is lost? After 4 bottles of the house wine we wanted either a calvados or poire william. A french restaurant should never run out of one - let alone all both!Ambience was good and the French lady hostess was very pleasant as always. No longer on my recommended list

1- we are french, so we are demanding by nature as afar as cuisine is concerned, nevertheless here is an open and straight forward feedback.2- we went there for christmas eve selecting the christmas menu3- to start the pan fried foie gras was great and the association with banana chutney is amazing => kudos to the kitchen and if you take a glass of sauternes it's even fantastic 4- the baked seafood casserole was nice even if the scallop taste was for me a bit hidden by the whole sauce5- my wife took the brill and kept satisfied while i take the quail that was a clear disapointement for me the stuff was not at the level of the rest and cranberry sauce destroy the main course taste fore me6- dessert was only one so if you re not fancy of chocolate you will be out of the taste feast! The service was kind but please review your Deco, the seats are sticky for singapore weather and this is a killing sensation.Take this as a motivation to improve as your art is difficult and critic always easier but that's the rule and in singapore restaurant competition is harsh 
5
Classic black and whites, good service and it feels more like a brasserie rather than a bistro. Thousands of miles better than the so called DB Moderne at Marina Bay Sands and much cheaper too!
Great experience!

Great french food, and great service
we had the lunch set
The french manager is very nice and taking time to discuss with clients.
Though it is not cheap
4
The food was good, and the decor was stylish, but comfortable.
The service started off well, but seem to deteriorate as more diners arrived; better training and communication between staff would make this place memorable!
4
We had an enjoyable dinner at Taratata bistro.The food is certainly more comfort food than haute cuisine but with a set dinner of starter, main and desserts for 35$, it is certainly a good deal.We tried the Egg Coco with Ratatouille which was very pleasantThe goat cheese salad was equally nice.For mains, we tried the Kurobuta Pork with lentils which was most enjoyable and the Crepes with ham and cheese which really is a calorie bomb and an indulgence but so pleasant.Desserts were the apple pie and red fruits sorbets.We left utterly full but happy about the discovery of such a good deal for the evening
5
Turned up very late but the staff agreed to look after us. Great hospitality . The wines were excellent as was the calvados. The food was very good although i thought the sauce a bit strong for the rabbit. I discussed this with the chef- it was duly noted. everything else was greatdidn't leave till after 12 ! staff were greatlooking forward to going bac
5
We never expected to find such a gem at Keong Siak Road! The food and wine is unbelievably good value for money. The chefs and restaurant manager Marie-Agnes is very charming and made us feel really comfortable here. Tried the Rilette de Canard, Cotes de Agneau, the Escargots, and the wine is excellent. The decor of black/white tiles and little curtains remind us of Quartier Latin, Marais and Montmartre. Highly recommended for romantic brunches, crepes and dinners
5
Taratata is a little gem, considering the very highly touted French restaurants in Singapore. It is owned-operated, with the very charming Marie Agnes managing the front of house. I booked from Australia, and was treated royally. The area attracts an eclectic crowd, and seating is either on the street at high stools, or indoors. A fixed price menu is available for S$35.00, and choices such as escargots, filet de port and sorbets are cooked and presented with attention to detail. Highly recommended for lovers of authentic food and a good value night out in pricy Singapore

Taratata was a good discovery in the still-gentrifying district of Keong Saik Rd. The chef is from the old L'Aigle D'Or, which for many was the best French restaurant in Singapore in the 1990s. It is a small, unpretentious restaurant with a fairly authentic French bistro ambience. The food isn't extraordinary but for the S$35 prix fixe menu for dinner, you really can't complain! In fact, it is a great bargain at that price. While the dishes aren't that creative, the traditional dishes are well done. The service was also excellent, without being fussy. The only drawback: the somewhat lackluster wine menu (though I should check if they allow you to bring your own wine for a corkage fee)

Hungry at lunch time and close to our hotel, Taratata was a spur-of-the-moment choice for an excellent lunch. Appetisers so big and filling that they were quite enough to eat for a late lunch. Not expecting much from a French Bistro in Chinatown Singapore, we were pleasantly surprised by the quantity and quality of the food and the friendliness of the staff. The three course set lunch menu may have been better value than our √†-la-carte choice but we were quite satisfied with our selection. So much so that we returned the following evening for dinner. This time we explored the Bistro menu more closely and enjoyed perfectly prepared Bavette de Boeuf √†-l'echalotte and Belgian Moules Frites with delicious Lobster Bisque and P√¢t√© de Foie de Volaille with real cornichons to start. The dessert menu was very tempting but beyond our capacity so we settled for a digestif instead.The Bistro is small yet comfortable and perfect for a long and cosy dinner. The staff were exemplary especially the Maitresse d' and the Korean waiter. Prices are reasonable for Singapore and represent excellent value for perfectly cooked French food. We will make a point of returning there on our next visit to Singapore

My wife and I were staying down the road in a `cosy' hotel called 1929 and had walked past it several times. From the outside it looks very inviting as it does look like your typical French bristro. We read the dining reviews and managed to book a table for dinner via the TimeOut Singapore which were offering 20% off the bill.The menu looked great and the wine looked normal for Singaporean prices ($18 per glass or bottles ranging from $70 and above). We started off with the Charcuterie Platter to share and I had to try out the Australian oysters which I found out were `Pacific oysters'. For the main I went for the `mussels & fries' and my wife opted for the `beef bourguignon'. The starters and mains were packed full of flavours and highly reflected the culinary skills of the French head-chef.One thing to point out that the waiting staff were trying to give it all their best, but at times it was over-intrusive as they were hovering around when we just wanted to enjoy each others company. All you can do is laugh it out and focus on the good food that is served in front of you. One advise to give to the restaurant owner is for the waiting staff to `relax' a little, especially when there was only four tables during a Tuesday night. I would recommend their set-lunch menu as an alternative. NOTE: Do not book the table via TimeOut Singapore as the 20% discount promotion ended last May12, but management did honour it on this occasion

It was a girls night out. Came before 7pm and was delighted to get a car park space right outside the restaurant. Tip for those who come later: take a cab. Service staff do try, but have not had enough training to handle the wine and beers. It's sad to come to a French restaurant and order beer, not as a matter of preference, but by default because the wines did not meet expectations. They would have done better to allow BYO sans corkage to make customers happy. I was not happy to be charged $18 for a glass of housepour, supposedly their "premium" range and it tasted like it had beem opened a little too long ago. This was confirmed wjen we asked and was told it had been opened 2-4 days ago. Food-wise was better. Usual items like duck confit and duck rillettes was well-prepared, if unimaginative. I liked the quail which was flavorful and not dry. I kept eyeing the beef bourgogne in the next table and the mountain-high plate of mussels. They smelt awesome! Dessert was very tasty as well, with plump well-soused raisins in every bite.

Taratata French Bistrot- a great place to have a relatively great value 3 course lunch.Have been there three times, all for lunch as I can walk there easily from my hotel. The food is good and good portion size. I really do not like the tiny tiny servings of food in some french fine diining restaurants, but tis being a Bistrot (written franco-ly correct, with a "T" a the end..a good sign???) the food servings were great for big eatesr like me.My appetiser was a terrine, more liuke a meat loaf of sort, and it was delicious. Highly recommend it. My dining partner had the escargot, and it was great too. And we dunk all the table bread into the garlic oil the escargot was served in, and it was heavenly. My main course of Pork belly with a crispy crackling was to die for.The pork was juicy, flavourful and we fought over the crackling!! I would want that everyday if I had the cholestrol level to handle it.It's worth taking cholestrol lowering pills for this divine porky pig!!!The other main was a grilled halibut and it was good, although I suspect it wasn't a fresh halibut. Frozen, perhaps?? The fish was cooked perfectly, moist and tender. But I thought the pilaf rice was unnecessary... maybe cos I am just not much of a rice person. Dessert was a Chocolate tart and it was a melting, gooey mess of greatness!! So so good..... We both agreed we would come back just for this chocolate tart, if not for any reasons at all....I came back 2 more times, and all 3 times it was satisfyingly good. And I will be back for more....

Went here for date night with husband and loved both the choice and quality of food. We both had Escargot for starters as it's our favorite. You got a dozen (most places offer 6 for starters) so that was a bonus and they were lovely! Then my husband got one of the specials 'aged steak' and I got the 'pork trotter'. Both were well presented and really tasty. The house red wine was lovely too. I wanted dessert but couldn't manage it. Will definitely go back

For more pictures and details visit : http://dairycream.blogspot.sg/2012/12/taratata-bistrot-hearty-unpretentious.htmlFrench Onion SoupThis was done exactly the way I wanted it to be. Cheesy toast which was soaked in the savoury goodness. Once you dig in, there seemed to be endless amount of soft onions Escargots in herbed garlic and butter, Crab and Pomelo SaladThe crab meat hidden by the greens were fresh, sweet and creamy. Reminds me of a dense coleslaw without the vegetables. The pomelo was bitter but matched well with the crab.These 3 dishes were followed shortly by 4 desserts, which were mostly accompanied with a pot of creme anglaise.Prune Clafoutis with Rum and Raisin Ice creamThis was unexpectedly good as this French dessert is usually served at home for in large servings. This individual tart-like Clafoutis had a chewy texture and is very sweet. The prunes as well as the ice cream emit strong hints of rhum. Worth a try since it's not common in local French menus.Creme Brulee This is relatively large but I like generous portions of desserts since it is difficult to be satisfied with morsels of good things.A fairly decent brulee for the price.Grand Marnier SouffleThis mighty souffle rises to a level which is one the highest I have seen so far. The alcohol kick was satisfying but somehow I still miss a chocolate souffle.The sweet cream is really good because one can control the sweetness of the dessert. I recommend pouring everything in as it would taste quite eggy and plain on its own. Warm Chocolate Cake with Lavender Ice CreamThis molten cake is once again larger than the usual ones. The gooey inner filling oozes out as expected but it would be better if the outer cake wall was thinner. Otherwise there would be no more molten lava to go with the dry parts. Nonetheless, the lavender ice cream and creme anglaise did set this dish a little different from the rest.The lavender ice cream was particularly unique pairing and I appreciate it more than a vanilla scoop. The scent of lavender was quite strong which some might not be used to.Overall, the French meal here was a comfortable and cosy one without the pressures of a fine-dining place. Moreover, the menu is not overpriced and has a variety of mains which include rabbit leg! The service staff were approachable and friendly. It was a pleasant surprise that Chef entered the dining section to have a short chat with us

Friends took us here last Saturday evening. Proper French menu with all the dishes one would expect in a French bistro. Really enjoyed the food. Can recommend the chef's platter, escargots and foie gras as starter. And boeuf bourguignon, blanc de veau and catch of the day for main course. Note that the French chefs here dont serve nouvelle cuisine, these are big plates with big portions!Wine menu is very nice as well, not too extensive but some good wines on there for everyone. Food and wine both affordable.Conclusion: menu, setting, pricing, food, wine all according to what one would expect from a good (and truly French) bistro. We will definitely return

They are trying too hard to make money - the ingredients need to be better. Staff are too stressed - management needs to let them relax. Had bizarre incident with the wine with nobody sure how much to charge - but looking very concerned about getting it wrong, even discussing it in my sight and pointing to the table. They want you to pay top book - but they want to 'over control costs'. Really good places 'breathe' this place does not - it tries to impose 'corporate canteen' discipline on a French restaurant. Sorry the whole idea does not work for me

Great French fare. Better even than some of the bistro's we visited in Paris earlier this year. It has all my favorite local French dishes including pate, escargot, rillette, lobster bisque, pickled herring salad and of course the main dishes of rabbit, lamb, beef bourignon, duck and even quail. The food was superb. I would come back and advise friends to check this place out if you want very good French food in Singapore.Side note, it was about $200 for two apps, 2 mains, 3 drinks but well worth it. Honestly, it might not be an every week thing but when I want French food I will fork out the money and come here for sure.Thanks for a great evening Taratata! See you again

Paris is famed for it's 'formule express' or 'quick lunch' so I was delighted to stumble across this very welcoming French bistro in Singapore, conveniently located near Chinatown and the CBD. The restaurant takes its name, 'bistrot,' from the original Parisian incarnation and this is about as authentic as it gets. Furthermore the food didn't disappoint and my menu rapide lived up to it's name - we were in and out in 40 minutes! The mushroom soup to begin was deliciously flavoursome and then we were bowled over by the generous portion of 'steak and frites.' The hanger steak was cooked to perfection and the side portion of salad overflowed from its bowl. The best $22++ I've spent in a while so I'll definitely be coming back although next time I plan to spend a lazy Sunday lunch here with family and friends or perhaps we'll join in their enticing Bastille Day celebrations on 14th July

I was there a for my birthday in March and my friends and I had the foie gras and seafood soup as starters, pork knuckle, duck confit, beef bourguignon and frogs legs as mains and the plum claufoutis, creme brulee and iced nougat for dessert! I loved that I was in the company of friends that could eat because I wanted to have so many things on the menu - and I must say that they were all exceedingly delicious! I loved, especially, the smooth silky texture of the potato mash that was served as a side in the beef and pork dishes, this simplicity must have been complex to achieve since so many other places have done it wrong. I've been back to Taratata Bistrot about 4 or 5 times ever since, it's hearty French bistrot fare that isn't hard on your wallet - especially their lunch menu! I heard that they were now open on Sundays and I look forward to my next trip there for their Sunday specials which are due to change each week
