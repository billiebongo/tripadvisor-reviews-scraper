Having been in Spain many times, I think I can recognise authenic food. The jamón is cut fresh and is very good. The Paella is very tasty.
Favourite restaurant of my wife and myself. Other ‘Spanish’ restaurants in Singapore so far do not compare.

Amazing tapas and even better paella! The view of the river and of MbS is spectacular. The service is exceptional. It’s hard not to like this place!

ate at both branches; bukit timah & boat quay! good food! will return again! kids friendly too but be sure to book before hand

Service was good and fast but food was bit salty for me so you may request for less salt on your order

The tapas Spanish omelette, croquettes and seared Iberico were awesome and flavourful. Highly recommended :)
5
We enjoyed the Paella and Sangria and the service was excellent. Enjoyed the walk along the river before and after.

I have now visited My Little Spanish Place on 3 occasions and every time has been great. The last 2 occasions have been with a large group and the service, food and atmosphere is always to a high standard. The paella is my favourite dish, itâ€™s delicious

My first visit to little Spanish was the coronation outlet but this time , thinking of trying the Boat Quay outlet , realise the service is different as the staff are not so experience and the food do taste slightly not as good as the other outlet

Went to the boat quay's little spanish place to try their food and celebrate a friend's birthday. We booked a table through Chope apps and the staff did give me a call on the day to confirm our reservation. Service was great and attentive. One of the male staff did a good job in recommending dishes and explaining all the different kind of ham to us! We ordered a ham platter at $60, which is a good spread of 4 types of ham to share , some tapas and seafood paella. Unfortunately we found that the paella was lack of seafood taste, it could be improved ! Overall was okay!

We ordered the paella of the day. Great grilled prawns on top but the paella itself was dull. And we ordered manchego cheese: very small portion - would rather pay more for more. The interior of the restaurant is very dark so we sat outside and got hot ... Service was goo

There are some people who have a natural love and affinity for a culture that on the surface, is not thier own. The Chef has deep love and respect for everything Spanish. He has a talent for taking cultural fare and making it in a way that transcends most (if not all) other Spanish restaurants. You should be pointing out that thanks to the Asian Gangster, people from every culture LOVE Spanish food.Dont judge the book by its cover. We love this Restaurant it has good ambiance and the Chefs is so accommodating and very humble. His passion in cooking Spanish food is what me and my husband admire the most. His food is incredibly good and staff are so accommodating and friendly. It feels like we're in a fine dinning restaurant. I ordered a mojito but they mostly serve beers and wine but they made it possible to make me one. I'am so please on the way they accomodate their costumers. Their Paella is the one I love most and they have a lot of menu to choose so better check them out. We highly recommend this place.

I am a frequent diner at MLSP as the food quality is always excellent. My Journey to MLSP Boat Quay came about due to the incredibly frustrating reservation experience at the Bukit Timah Restaurant. I had emailed and also called and left a voice message to reserve a table. Frustratingly the restaurant never replied to either. When I turned p at the restaurant i was asked if i had a reservation, I told them that if they had actually bothered to respond to my requests then perhaps I might have but as they didnt i had no reservation. I was told that they were too busy to respond and that they were fully booked. This is a small restaurant not a mass catering outlet so come on guys as a frequent diner at all of your restaurants i would expect better.Having said that and not to be deterred I ventured down to the Boat Quay restaurant and typically the food was excellent, Friendly staff and great service. despite the earlier hiccup please do not let this deter you from visiting MLSP its definitely my go to place for tapas and spanish food in singapore. I had a beautiful table water side. The Joselita Ham, Meat balls and Prawns in garlic were amazing. No paella last niht but i saw a couple of tables order it and again looked amazing.Poor show on the reservations guys you need to sort that out but 10/10 for the food yet again

We arrived on a saturday evening at 6.45, ordered 4 starters and a paella for main. We left at 8.20 and we never managed to eat dinner as paella never arrived after our 4 average starters..Even after the 1st 30 mins of delay that we complained that our main had not arrived we were told that should be with us in 10 but after another 30 minutes still nothingWe called the manager and asked for the bill which we managed to get after a lot of convincing. We never got an apology for 1 hour and 30 minutes of wait, but all we heard was "no problem we will not charge the main, its okay....".Will not visit again, suggest to avoi

I organized the dinner for 4 of us and pick the place. Overall the experience is good, and the food is good, and we've a wonderful evening, even though it was raining rather heavily and I arrived 15-minutes late (luckily my friend got that there on time). We ordered couple of appetizers, hams, paella also a bottle of cava :-) Last but not least - we also ordered desserts and end the nights well - feeling satisfied and glad to be visit the place for dinner.In terms of food that I like - (1) Paella is good (2) Appetisers are good (3) Desserts are good Wine / Drinks selection is plenty - and we settled for a bottle of Cava - something bubbly and a bit sweet for our relaxing conversation.
4
I've been here a few times now - so I obviously like it or I wouldn't keep returning.The food is always lovely, the venue is great - especially since the area overlooking the water has been refurbished. If you want a quick drink or some tasty little tapas, this is a great choice
5
The whole vibe of the store is very nice. I don't think I've had this type of Spanish cuisine even in Los Angeles. Mix the good food with great view along the river and your day/night will be complete. Thank you Chef Edward for all the recommendation. The oxtail was definitely one of my favorites

Friday night drinks and dinner with the girls. We had a few tapas to share: cheese, prawns, clams, chicken skewers and croquettes. Food is average, wine is ok. Probably adds up to be on the expensive side.The paella looked good although we didn't get to try it this time around. Place does get busy into the evening so bookings recommended. With drinks from $60 per head

Made reservations the day before. On the day itself, received a call from an electronic voice asking me to confirm the reservations.Was warmly welcomed when we arrived at the restaurant. Water was quickly served; free might I add in contrast to a recent experience at another restaurant.We ordered the paella which requires a 40 mins waiting time. While waiting for the paella, we had a few tapas: Tortilla De Patata, Patatas Bravas Con Manchego & Albondigas De La Casa. All of them were good though we had actually ordered Croquetas De Jamon instead of the Tortilla. The paella was worth the 40 mins; we enjoyed it.If you are looking for a quiet place to eat, this is not it. The music was rather loud but it adds to the dining experience.Best to make reservations as the place is quite small

Short & simple review:1. Food - delicious, but slightly costly 2. Service - perfect (waitress introduced & recommended the food variety patiently & professionally)3. Payment service - would recommend them to have a backup plan if their system malfunction, to avoid long queue/wait that might caused inconvenience to most of the customer
4
Pulpo de la casa (grilled Octopus) is highly recommended.! It was so good we reordered and patiently waited for it.Gambas with garlic:recommendedChorizo : highly recommendedThe 5 types of ham: ok, worth trying onceSpanish padron pepper: ok, must be eaten with ChorizoTapa de entrecot (ribeye steak) : highly recommended, tender, juicy, timing just right for medium rare. Secreto iberico (seared iberian pork): recommended.Croquetas: so soClams in Chorizo broth: okSangria was a bit too light to my liking

There are not many good spanish places around, and this is one of the rare ones which happens to be reasonably-priced as well.
5
Every dish ordered was good... not exactly the cheapest Spanish restaurant to dine at but definitely value for the price.
1
food full of MSG.The Paella De la casa was full of MSG and oily. I cant believe that I dine in on a restaurant that use MSG. The head chef must have terrible pallet to use MSG to make the food nice.
Price was ok.
3
Way too slow service. One of the four mains did not arrive on the table after repeated request. And it was not a busy Thursday lunch.
4
Tried some tapas dishes and they were really good, although some dishes were too salty to my liking. Chill ambiance and good service!
4
This is the best spanish tapas i have found in Singapore! Quite reasonably priced just a little let down by the service which was slow.
4
First time and only had time for a quick lunch. Ordered the Secreto Iberico and it was delicious! Very well marinated and smoked using their secret recipe. It was not exactly a large portion and a little pricey. Will be trying other dishes soon. Recommended!
4
The paella was delicious and all the fresh seafood was nice and plump! Definitely good value for money. Will be back!
5
we had outside seating and the food was good and view fantastic. we would go back again. One point was that some of the staff did have a hard time understanding English but we got there in the end :-)

Went for dinner with a friend on a Friday night. Was pretty full but not to the limit. I suggest reservations. Signage is not the best, but easy enough to find by street number (54). Pretty much in the middle of the Boat Quay strip of eating places and bars.Boat Quay is a big tourist draw and there are quite good places to eat and many tourist traps. My Little Spanish Place is a good place to eat and inside was calm and isolated from the hustle and bustle outside.Service was fine. Not the fastest and most attentive but certainly got the job done. We had a selection of tapas and a good bottle of wine. My friend described the food as "bursting with flavor". The portions were good the spices and flavors were well done. I have been to Spain a few times and it tasted authentic enough. Prices were on the higher end, but not unusual for Singapore when there is a lot of imported items being served. Wine prices were not excessive but better wine meant somewhat higher prices. Plus the location must come with higher rent.I enjoyed the grilled pork and the potatoes. Everything was properly cooked and served reasonably while still hot and fully enjoyable.They had a typical display of legs of fine ham. I have never found the high cost worth it whenever I have had it before, but it does taste good

Having read TP we chose to eat at this restaurant with high hopes
I'll keep this brief; so simply get the service levels to match the food quality otherwise you'll lose repeat customers
5
Great Paella and the food is great. I love the Gambas al Ajillo, i think it is a must order.
As authentic as it can get in Singapore.
5
The squid ink paella is so good. Cant go wrong with this place. I love all the sexy legs display. Will be back again
4
Food is good with nice view along the singapore river. We like the sea food rice the most and certainly will come back again.
4
Food was delicious and seafood was fresh. Paella is a must-order, awesome fresh ingredients, very tasty.
4
products are good, tasty and good flavor, meals were OK, good seasoning and nice dressage. Nice decoration in the restaurant, it is simple, good and efficient.

MLSP gets 5 stars from me for the entire experience we had at the restaurant from the food to the service to the ambience! Everything was beyond expectations! The service staff was attentive and prompt to all our requests, as well as giving recommendations. The food was fresh and tasted delicious, i would say one can get good quality spanish food here, and they have quite a spread of tapas to choose from as well! A definite mush try will be their Secreto Iberico! Sangria is also worth a try! and the level of service was best exemplified when the floor manager joined in to sing the birthday song together, she was also friendly in catering to the requests that we had! Ambience wise, it was rather cosy and relaxing inside with the music playing in the background. Well worth a return visit definitely! Mui Bien

She's from Venezuela and quite hospitable. Tapas and jamon/ cheese came at the same time. That's a Singapore habit but the restaurant should know better. Food was overall good, not great. Wine overpriced. Churro too sweet and not crunchy. Had a much better experience 6 months ago at the same restaurant on Bukit Timah
2
The food took a long time to serve when the restaurant was not crowded, it took about 2 hours to serve 4 to 5 dishes. There was a miscommunication between the new chef and the waitress for the Paella we had ordered. The family did not enjoy the lunch
4
Love Spanish food and this restaurant is authentic. Some dishes however came in smaller portions than others who are similar in price range. Was a little astonished. Paella was good but prices are a tad steep too
4
Was there for a farewell dinner with colleagues. Food was amazing. Service was good too. May return in the future.

We had been walking around the river area and by the time we got to Boat Quay we were ready for some lunch but had not made any plans or done any research so we ended up picking this Spanish restaurant as a non-Asian option among the plethora of eateries along the Quay. We were welcomed and found the staff to be friendly and helpful. The air conditioning combined with ceiling fans running at full speed meant that the dining room was quite cool, almost too much so.We selected some Tapas including a small Paella (the last serving left as it turned out but we were eating lunch quite late), Patatas Bravas (perhaps not a clever choice in the local climate but delicious anyway), a salad and a chorizo plate. All were delicious. We washed these down with some Spanish Estrella cervesas.It was a most pleasant lunch, relaxing and enjoyable. Seeing the hams displayed on the bar made the option to sample the jamonâ€™s very tempting and we might return just to try the sample plata. Pricing was quite reasonable. As an accidental find this was a gem

Food was good but restaurant should look into changing the light bulbs used to bulbs that give off less heat. Restaurant ambience would have been better with better ventilation and air conditioning

Had a bit of a hard time looking for the plc cz the sign board was eclipsed by anor!!Svc was good. Some hits n some misses. Overall was a good experience.Wish we tried the Suckling pig. The Iberico was really good..had an enjoyable tim

Affordable prices, good ambience and also good food! My Little Spanish Place offers good Spanish food at very affordable prices ($49 for a small paella which was more than enough for 2 people) and also has a quaint homely ambience that welcomes its customers! the food and drinks are nice and although some dishes require about 30-ish mins of waiting time, it's well worth it.

dinner for 2. Service was efficient, the quality and the presentation of the food was very good. (size of the portion is more than the usual tapas bar in Singapore). Limited choice of wine by glass (can be improved). Reasonably expensive. We will go for sure

...because, to me, My Little Spanish Place certainly scores big on food, service and location. I've heard great things about this restaurant at Boat Quay from a colleague of mine and been wanting to visit for months. Finally came around to it last week, when my friend and I met here for dinner and wine. Food is, without a doubt, a certified winner! The Gambas and Chorizo that we ordered were both exquisite. The cheese platter was also good - especially their manchego. The staff were very warm, efficient and accommodating. The only minus point was that they no longer have the outside seating that's adjacent to the river - because the whole stretch is being renovated, or perhaps turned into something else (not sure). When it comes price, I think the food is okay and over-the-top expensive, even with its location at Boat Quay. The wine, though, is a bit on the high side. But then again, it's Singapore.:

We had lunch there (6ppl). The place is cozy. Food is amazing. Service is good. We ordered lunch set for each and four tapas for sharing. $25 per person including drink. Price is quite decent compared to the quality. We would love to coma back here again :

Lovely tapas in a nice setting and not too expensive :-)Wine selection good too.Will definitely visit again
5
Food was good, as was the wine recommendations and service. They even called to let me know the outdoor seats I requested weren't recommended as there were on going renovations.
