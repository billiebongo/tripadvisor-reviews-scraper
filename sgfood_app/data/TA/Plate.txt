Excellent range of items for breakfast, I'm sure any dietary requirements could be easily met. Loved the fresh fruit.

The service here was good, the staff were mostly very polite. Plates were cleared regularly too. The ambience here was really cosy and relax, the feeling is just like at your own home.

Their lunch buffet spread had local, Japanese and Western dishes.
Although it wasn't a big restaurant, the choice was sufficient. The crabmeat soup was worth it.
Salad station wasn't that big though.
