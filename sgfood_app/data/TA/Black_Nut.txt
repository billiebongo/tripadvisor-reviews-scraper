The Black Nut. A pub in Emerald Hill. Whatâ€™s super interesting is the decor that infuses the local culture of the area, the Peranakan.

Worth the visit, with excellent customer service. The food and drinks are affordable and worth the price. This place has waiters that provide good customer service. As it was my first visit, i was not familiar with the menu and took a longer time for my order. One of the waiter, Patrick, who served me was very patient and polite. He introduce me to some of the most popular picks and it was obvious that he knows the menu and he is familiar with the drinks. It was really a pleasant experience and i would definitely be there again.

The environment here was very good. Patrick was very friendly and made us feel very welcomed. He even advised us on the kind of mixtures we should take and it was real good. Great experience!

Found this place by chance and been back here almost every week since! If you're fed up with the noisy bars with screaming drunks, this is the solution: comfortable couches and stools and armchairs replace traditional stiff barstools and is perfect to chill after a long day with friends and sometimes just listen to music. Their local themed drinks are super Singaporean and tastes good too with a buzz. Chick Norris is the best and go for their mojitos if you have a sweet tooth. The ever friendly and fun staff are also the main reasons why we always come back!

Wonderful night with fantastic service, food and drinks! My friend and I had lots of drinks and a little bit of food (chicken skin is the best thing everrr) and they were all really delicious. My favourite drink for the night was definitely the Blowjob shot - A new for me actually and I'll be back again for more! Ayie made our entire night a whole lot better by interacting with us and checking in on us often. She also cracked jokes and made my us laugh all night. Thank you for a spectacular night Ayie! We'll be back again soon

We originally planned to meet friends next door but the live band there made it impossible to talk. So we moved here for mocktails, beer, luncheon meat fries, and chicken wings. All good. Fantastic ambience
