There is a variety of different cuisines from various countries like from Indonesia, Thai, etc available.It's affordable, fast and tasty food. The place itself has interesting design , and with combined with Fountain of Wealth's scenery during night for dinner makes it perfect.

Just like a big food court anywhere in the world , cash only, lots of workers eat there so that is always a good sign. Take hand sanitizer or baby wipes as you don’t get servette always. Food was made fresh.

We are taking several times a week our business lunch in this place.

Quick and affordable lunch from mini restaurants serving a wide choice of hawker fare in a nice, clean, air conditioned environment. A great option,
5
We popped here for some lunch and were not disappointed. Great service, air con and most importantly the best noodles we had in singapore for next to nothing. Shopping mall version of a hawker centre.

Full of varieties of foods, food republic is one of the best place to eat when in Singapore. Enjoy your meal!

We picked the Hainan Chicken Rice stall and the chicken was 'okay' but definitely nothing to shout about.I think they could do with more 'sauce' options as the standard Soya Sauce or Ginger left the dish pretty lame - could do with some spicier sauces we felt.Cheap Eats in a Canteen style setting - after all, it is a Food Court and this is exactly what you get

a bit expensive compared to regular hawker but reasonable as they have that high-end feel. all cooks are dressed as chefs! interior design is superb with a consistent dominant monochrome with some warmth of timber. i like most of the food. i usually eat the indonesian bbq which is unique compared to most of what i've eaten, grilled salmon / curry salmon/chicken... i like the chicken rice also which serves S,M,L.. drinks are not that expensive also. generally clean food place. usually eat dinner here almost twice a week as can see the fountain which is just infront of the foodcourt

Went here with some local people and really enjoyed it. The food is great with ample choice and variety. Great price-quality also. Only thing is with a group of 4 it takes some time to find a table. I had tandoori chicken that was very nice.

I have tried steamed chicken rice come with hot soup and vegetable while walking around Suntec City and it was super awesome!
จานนี้ขอบอกเลยว่าทีเด็ด เนื้อชิ้นอ้วนๆนุ่มมากกกก เสิร์ฟกับซุปร้อนๆ ผักอีกจาน เซทนี้ประมาณ SGD 7.00 อร่อยฟิน

Dropped into the Food Republic while at Suntec Towers. The range of food offerings was good and we found the pricing to be quite reasonable, especially for such a popular area. Would be very happy to eat there again.
3
Enjoyed a great late lunch with friends quite place plenty of space to relax. Look forward to my next time round. Had the claypot chicken with rice, fresh and good.
5
We arrived at closing time and they gave us a large discount on 3 plates of leftover food. The cous cous was amazing. The guys working at the shop were very friendly and helpful.
5
We usually go to Food republic everytime a friend is in town. Its an amazing place in a central location and the vegetarian stall is superb! Great value for money, pleasant ambiance (if you get a seat by the fountain) and happy tummies!
4
Very crowded. You need to come early for lunch for big group. There is a Li Xin fishball noodle beside the food court are good. They have Indian vegetarian food, prawn noodles and Wu Xiang there too.

Food Republic at Suntec City had around 8-10 stalls in a small area of B2 level. Price was a bit high but service was very slow. We had to wait 15-20 minutes to wait for the food to be prepared while no one was standing in front of us. Staff was not friendly at all. Just visited because we were at Suntec and lazy to go out, otherwise, we would skip Food Republic here

Food republic adjacent to temasek roundabout hosts an array of vendors in the old tradition. Favourite is the Paratha stall which offers a variety of great dishes at street prices in hygienic surrounds. Fresh fruit stall gives access to exotic slices without the entire fruit . "teh tarik " drawn tea, is an art form, where the pot is drawn upwards while pouring, ...the best exponents are living treasures of street food artisanry. Singapore has many local unsung gems beyond the malls. Make your own mosaic for next time
5
This was a regular place for us to eat, especially breakfast and dinner. The food stalls are open by the time we get there around 9:00am. Fresh fruit, fresh juices, noodle soups, etc, etc, etc. It is a very well planned area with coffee shops, restaurants, food stalls and a large fresh food / groceries store
5
I will never get tired eating at Food Republic. With the wide selection of great food at inexpensive prices, one would really have a hard time choosing what to eat. What I would suggest is just to try them all!My favourite dishes are:Kung Pao Chicken from Mini WokSalted Fried Rice from Mini WokPopiahMee GorengChicken Satay with peanut sauceI hope I could come back soon to Singapore and eat these dishes again. By the way, don't forget to partner these dishes with lime juice or water chestnut for your drink :
5
Great location next to the fountain! Had pad thai from Thai Kitchen, made to order, hot, really tasty and chilli on the side to suit your taste! Great for quick food and can takeaway
4
It was just a quick snack at lunch time, as we were on a sightseeing tour bus ,and if we ate to much at all we wouldn't enjoy our dinner at night
5
Can't comment on the entire complex as I only ate at one place and was drawn to it as a vegetarian. Excellent range of Indian vegetarian dishes with very friendly staff. Had a thali and enjoyed every dish,. Great value as well.
3
Not very exciting. May be that is because I do not prefer the kind of food that was available over there.
5
A wide variety of different cuisine to choose from , in a very clean and hygienic surrounding, place is air conditioned so you can avoid the high humidity in Singapore, a little more pricey than the Kopityam. choose from Korean, Vietnamese, thai and Indian cuisine also variety of fresh fruits and beverages
4
So convenient to have Food Republic around. Everyone in the family regardless of their food preference and craving will find something they like in Food Republic. Most restaurant stalls have very reasonable priced food offerings. A good filling meal starts at around SGD7-10 and up. Another SGD3.00 up for drinks. Really value for money
5
One of the best curries I have ever had. The fish head curry was fantastic as was the chicken tikka masala. The food is eaten off banana leaves. It was great to have a Kingfisher beer that came from India. Would definitely recommend this restaurant. We were served by Reji and he was delightful

There are two Food Republic Food Courts, the one we ate at is the one in just off to the side of the Fountain of Wealth. There are many food outlets in Food Republic and we didn't try a stall where the food wasn't good. However, our absolute favorite was "Traditional Soup" (It faces the main passageway and has 5-6 huge vats of fragrant soups on display). We ate there 4 times and tried a different soup each time. Not one of them was greasy. The meaty broths were chock-full of fresh veggies and were served with one side dish of your choice and a bowl of white rice. The friendly woman who serves the soup makes one feel so welcome. I could have eaten here every day - it was so healthy and filling...and a bargain

This food court has the worst Japanese food I have ever tasted! The chicken is over cooked, the fried white fish so oily and dry and the miso soup tasteless!!The ambience is nice, especially if you can get a table at the opposite side of the food court, facing the fountain of wealth.Maybe just come here for a drink next time. None of the food stalls look nice. And the Japanese food stall we tried was a BIG DISAPPOINTMENT

If you're familiar with the Food Republic chain in Singapore, then you know that this is a place that has food stalls offering a variety of food. This particular branch has some 30 stalls and almost everything looks good. It's actually difficult to make a choice.We tried a place that offers rice toppings served on mini-woks and another one that offers Indonesian barbecue (sorry, forgot to note the name of the stalls) - both were very good. Even the drinks are good - you can have your choice of sodas, different blends of iced tea, juices and even desserts.The area is big enough to accommodate the throngs of people every day. The aunties and uncles who clean the tables do their work very quick to ensure that the waiting time for tables is kept to a minimum. The interior is very nice - you get the feeling of dining in an old Singapore street.The prices are reasonable and this place is really what fast food is all about. Quick but does not sacrifice taste and quality.This is a good stop after shopping or touring Sentosa
