Friendly and attentive staff, fresh sandwiches and pies/quiches. Good location. This is a great lunch spot.

Wessex Tavern is a hidden gem. Many don't know of it, tucked away as it is in an unassuming low-slung building on the lusciously green Portsdown Road. I hope it stays—it feels like an anachronism given the megaliths that have appeared on Portsdown Road in recent years. I've been going there for the past five years both with friends or family and when I want to be by myself and read. I've only ever had breakfast—great full-on English breakfast—or coffee—excellent made-to-order-bone-dry-cappucino—there but they serve an array of baked goods, savoury and sweet, and regular food, as well as a variety of alcohol. My happiest times at Wessex Tavern have been sitting outside on the narrow verandah, ceiling fans whirring, looking out at the verdure particularly during a tropical thundershower when the rain on the corrugated tin roof above drowns out other sounds. All conversation needn't be lost during a rainstorm—the inside of the Tavern is equally charmant, lazily whirring fans and all. The service staff are lovely and I always feel welcome and well-accomodated at the Wessex Tavern

The Wessex Tavern sits in an oft forgotten corner Singapore. It's a lovely quiet location and very restful for breakfast. The full English is awesome with real pork sausage and bacon that tastes properly bacon. Nothing deep fried!Be nice if they provided butter with the bread but that's a very small niggle. A must must for a weekend brunc
