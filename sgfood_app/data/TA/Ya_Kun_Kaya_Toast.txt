For toast, egg, and coffee will set you back about $6
I enjoyed it, however the food seemed to easy to cost so much relative to other food you can get with so much more effort, like hawker type food.

To those who love toast, budget breakfast. Love the coffee and toast here. I highly recommend. They open at 7am.

Coffee is traditional in the sense that it's with condensed milk. Not your normal Starbucks.
French toast with kaya was great.

I ordered a hot tea drink. Forgot what it's called but it went great with the cream puff at the adjacent store. 👌🏼

The kaya butter toast and soft boiled eggs are always reliable. And this branch has friendly staff from china, very unusual!

The 1st time I tasted Ah Kun coffee in 2010, I was so amazed by the awesome aroma, I had since purchase the coffee powder by the bags each time I visit Singapore, 2 to 3 times a year. I share the coffee powder with friends and family, and they too have been enchanted by the exceptional aroma of Ah Kun's coffee. I absolutely love it ! I come back to Asia twice a year from the US, I would not drink any other coffee other than Ah Kun's. Give it a try ! Hmmm......

The original stall started off with their speciality kaya toast. However they now have a variety of other dishes as well which are worth trying We were at the Tampines branch, just after visiting the CPF building and had our breakfast there. Ordered the kaya toast as well as the mee siam. First time trying their mee siam and thought it was good! Loved the tangy flavour. There was also alfresco dining which was accompanied by a gentle breeze. Lovely

Great food, quick service, awesome prices!One of the things you remembered about Singapore is when my friend Simon took me here to this place! I love the set menu and the kaya toast. The coffee is awesome and had a nice quick to it.I took my family here and they immediately fell in love with the kaya toast. You can mix it with butter, cheese, peanut butter and so much more. I prefer the kaya butter toast!The lines were long but the service was very fast and efficient. I'll be back again

Kaya toast with butter is the best. Specially with the toasted bread. Not so happy with the toast with cheese. For my standards the cheese was to little. I dont mind paying an extra $1 on its $2.4 sing price. The barley drink was refreshing I should have gotten the large size and its not too swee
