Love the chef, chatted with him quite a bit, love the food and ambience. Try the pork belly and the cocktails
4
For a good night our go to The Study for some good food and then nip next door to The Library and finish off with some great cocktails.
4
exceptional burger, truffle fries, drinks and warm friendly service. lovely atmosphere though loud groups can overpower
2
Portion is too small and not filling at all. So disappointed! I will never return again. Perhaps an offer from them i might consider. I would never recommend this restaurant to other.
4
We had fish and chips and the burger which tasted wonderful! great atmosphere. Ordered drinks as well and the cider was served in a metal mug - interesting!
5
Had dinner at the Study tonight enjoyed every single bite of my Sirloin steak and the exquisite berry bake dessert. I am certainly going again for more!
5
Had an amazing dinner here at The Study. We didn't make resos so we got a seat at the bar and it was perfect! We got a chance to chat with the Chef and he was so informative and an amazing cook. We had the pork belly and my husband had the burger, which was amazing. The cocktails next door at The Library was fun

It was an amazing lunch experience at The Study. From the moment I stepped in, till the moment I left, I was attended to by the most attentive staff, which is really rare in Singapore. The staff were all friendly, warm and authentic. That wasn't all, the food was great too! I deicide to have the three course lunch (At $35++). For The starter Fois Gras Scotch egg was a brilliant, for my main course I had the Wagyu beef with a soft bone crust Served on a bed of greens with some gravy, this was just delicious, for dessert I had a cinnamon donut with salted caramel cream, The generous serving of cream, with its salted caramel flavour, was a perfect balance for the sweet donut. I also was impressed not only by the gorgeous food, also by the staff for been very friendly and attentive efficiency and for the quality of service (very professional). A perfect lunch, and gorgeous food. I truly recommend this place. I will be back really soooooon! Well done
3
The small plates were good, but there was a limitation for people who want to have foods with no pork and beef. The atlantic burger was our target but it was not sold on that day. The music was a little too loud, but its neighbour the library was a good treat! nice place to chill after a long day,but it will be better with a greater variety of food!=) will recommend this place though!
5
Wonderful place to kick back and hang out with friends. We basically ordered every small plate dish on the menu. Each one was well presented and delicious! My fav has to be the mackerel and toast which was perfectly cooked, with all the right flavours. Also the beef large plate dish was tender and melts in your mouth. Last but not least we could not go without the dessert, the doughnut was to die for. Definitely a staple of ours in Singapore from now on!
5
The Study is no longer part of Jason Atherton's global restaurant empire, but Chef Danial Thorlby doing a great job there regardless. Enjoyed an excellent value wine pairing dinner there recently and looking forward to go back to try the a la carte menu.
5
The food was superb especially the wagyu beef burger and gosh the mac and cheese was terrific too! Great service and the library is so cool!
5
My family and I thoroughly enjoyed our experience at The Study. We felt taken care of, quality of food was great (seabass & beef, ice cream too!). They were kind to surprise us with a little something for mom's birthday. Keep up the great level!
5
A very good lunch here with great service and exceptional food. Would highly recommend a business lunch here.
5
So to the left of The Study is the little hidden Library well known for its cocktails. Source yourself the daily password (from The Study's website) walk into what seems to be nothing but a little room and be guided through to one of the best little hidden bars in Singapore. Use the bar staff to help quench your thirst by challenging them to make you a cocktail to tantalize your taste buds. The food and cocktails have always been the main reason to come but the staff are the reason to stay
5
Heard a lot about the popular Iberico scotch eggs on the menu and finally I am here to try it. Love it instantly, given my weakness for runny yolks and the Jamaican-inspired sweet potato on the side was delish in its own marinade. The squid is very crispy, not so oily, and too addictive that I would for a bigger portion!Cocktails are one of their specialties. A must to order something off the list. I had the Nutty Professor that arrived like how its name suggested. It was cute, and I loved the creativity behind it
4
Small and cozy place to bring small group of friends to enjoy a lovely evening.They have several lovely small bites and i would highly recommend their scotch eggs.We ordered their tomahawk steak which was the star highlight of the night. The steak was juicy and flavourful with roasted vegetables and quinoa which was really tasty
4
We did a bar hop night and was at the Study for one of our first stops. We had the salmon to share and a bottle of wine. Both were good but we thought it was a bit pricey, especially the food ;-) nonetheless, we found the place cozy, and it is actually connected to the Library which is a cocktail bar and a different experience. We had a blast!! :-) highly recommended!! (Remember to ask The Study staff for The Library password!!
5
Definitely need to come thru!! Remember to make a reservation! Try their scotch eggs! And if you're up for it, gotta have their tomahawk steak! Which is what we ordered! Extra friendly service staff! The menu changes from time to time. Their desserts are on another level tho,because everything sounded so nice on the menu, I ordered everything!! For reals!! Nothing disappointed! Especially the cinnamon doughnuts with salted caramel chantilly cream and pandan chiffon cake with coconut ice cream! Will defiantly go back and try other stuff on the menu!
5
Had dinner with my close friends and his family the other day. When we stepped in, it was a bit quite so my husband was a little skeptical. But boy, we were wrong. Every dish, from the starter to the dessert were beautifullye executed. I especially enjoyed the tomahawk (and i dont exactly like meat) and the cinnamon doughnut which was so deceivingly simple. Overall, i look forward to go back again!
2
Regretted ordering delivery from The Study. Fish was so soggy and burger wasn't good. My expectations literally dropped the moment I took the first bite. Food was placed in cheap plastic containers just like food that I buy from hawker centers. Very disappointing experience.
5
We were greeted with a cozy setting and friendly waitresses. We ordered the 1.2kg Wagyu beef in medium rare but it was slightly towards rare. Roasted vegetable sides were really good though.
1
very disappointing sadly. Empty at lunch, set menu was unappealing so went a la carte with the recommended dishes - scotch egg and fish and chips. Neither anything special and pricey (S$17 for scotch egg, though it was iberico pork sausage meat)
5
Came here for lunch this week and opted for the 3 course set lunch at $30++. I had the scallops, sea bass and a sorbet for dessert. Food quality was really good and the service was efficient and friendly. I would definitely come back.
4
First of all: staff is great. Fast,friendly, polite.
Atmosphere: 7
Food: nothing special and limited choices.
Overall, good to just walk in and have diner but not for a special evening.
4
Really enjoyed our night out. We walked in off street with no reservation and luckily we got a table. We had heard a lot about the Library and wanted to go, we did not realised the study would transform into the library so it was a great surprise
2
I went to this place with other 6 of friends. Part of my group was arrived earlier. When I arrived this place with other half of group. One of us have to use the restroom badly. Only 1 restroom was available at that time. When asked for alternative solution besides waiting on a huge Q. The male and female staffs not responses very well and kinda making faces on us. So, I left with other part of group and no chance to try out their cocktails which I heard it's good. Oh well.. You're selling drinks at night >>> water in >> water needed to get out too. If more restroom available and staffs better behavied.. I would considering revisit once again!
5
The study is the restaurant portion of the cool cocktail bar, the library. It's not a big place but it was packed! We got the kitchen counter seats - and to me, those are the best seats in the house. We got to witness every prep done by Chef Daniel Syed and team! Totally impressed from the very first minute we sat down. T'was the very time my husband and I tried wine from Uruguay and I have to say I love it! Smooth and not too rich. Just the way we like it.. Feels good on the palette.. We had the mussels with sourdough bread to start. Thumbs up! We are big eaters- the hubb and I. So we got ourselves the fish and the TOMAHAWK!!! 1.2kg of beef! Never thought we'd finish it but believe you me, we ate it clean! The beef was so delicious and very well seasoned! The cocktails were awesome too! I ordered some duck in a bath drink and my "cup" was literally a bathtub with a rubber duckie in it!! For desserts, we had the pandan chiffon cake with jelly!!! I could go on and on... But I'm choosing to go back there soon!!!! One of the better places I've dined at
3
The restautant has charm and the staff were good. Overall experience was good but food was average. We had the 1.5kg steak. It had a few good pieces of meat but a lot of odds and ends which one could not eat ... and buried underneath were some vegetables in desperate need of seasoning. Might come again and give another dish a chance, but not rushing back
4
Good food, friendly staff. Although they forgotten our orders (the waitress said its due to a system glitch), they gave us a glass of white wine each as an apology. I think its a good gesture. Came to check on us to see if everything was okay. Thumbs up
5
Interesting food combos, beautifully presented and excellent service. We continued to the Library for after dinner drinks and were blown away by the quality of the cocktails and passion of bartenders.
5
Very cool place to come to cocktails, one of the best in Singapore. The place has a great vibe and interesting decor. Very nice inside, and a great selection of drinks. Come with a small group of friends.
4
It was a nice place to settled in for brunch. Restaurant is not very crowded. Is not too noisy even though there is some big groups. Service is awesome. Will visit again.

My wife and I went for lunch as we had an Entertainer 2 for 1 voucher for the set 3 course lunch. First impressions were good, Nice funky decor and friendly waiter but he didn't know much about the names of the dishes and what they contained..there was a salted egg chicken and I wanted to know what this was. Anyway, my wife order chicken wings as a starter, cauliflower cheese as a main. I ordered masala burrito as a starter and the salted egg chicken after the manageress explained what it was.My burrito arrived first and was quite nice. My wife's chicken wings arrived as I was finishing the burrito. Her wings were pink inside so sent them back. My main course arrived and was quite tasty. My wife's second order of wings arrived just as i was finishing my main, but were also pink inside so sent them back. Eventually her main of cauliflower chees arrived, it was very watery and no better than she can make at home. The manageress offered us a complimentary glass of wine each as an apology and also brought a complimentary scotch egg main to accompany her cauliflower. we both had doughnut and cream for dessert, the doughnut was delicious but the cream was salted caramel and was inedible as it was way too salty. The manageress also brought a small complimentary dish of peanut butter ice cream which was fantastic.I have to say the manageress was great and about the only thing that stopped us walking out without paying, but she was let down by the kitchen, such a shame as the place has a nice feel. Don't think we will return, despite her effort
5
Brunch with friends with an amazing ambience and quirky decor. Great music. Fantastic coffee and REAL thick cut bacon. Free flow booze is optional and a fantastic price for Singapore.The food is fresh and piping hot. Small menu selection for brunch but something for everyone's taste. Service is outstanding with staff happy and smiling and genuine. I even wanted to know the name of a song playing and they happily found it for me.Will be back for sure
5
We have been to The Study many times and it never disappoints. The service is great and the food delicious. Especially good is the scotch egg and the Atlantic cod (although sadly it was not available last night). I love the cinnamon doughnuts (one portion between two is plenty) and my husband loves the bakewell tart. It's not cheap but you don't have to have 3 courses and it's a great little restaurant.
4
The staff started off a little unattentive, but after we got better acquainted they got really nice and the quality of the food is reaally amazing, the only thing is, I rather would have had dinner in the very lively bar...but a good reason to come back, I would say, because I can recommend it to everybody
4
The atmosphere is great for a group night out though the music is a bit loud for conversations with people further away than to your left, right or in front. The food is delicious. Scotch eggs and Atlantic cod were a hit. The wine menu had reasonably priced wines for Singapore prices. Service was fine. Definitely recommended.
4
Came here with 4 friends on a Tuesday night with no reservations. The restaurant was full but the staff let us sit in the Library next door and order food from the Study. Service was very attentive. The Library was much more chill than usual, probably because it was early in the evening so the atmosphere was quite nice. Food was okay, but nothing that blows your mind. We ordered everything to share: for mains we had the cod, short ribs, pork, cauliflower, chicken wings; for dessert the doughnuts and some kind of cake with ice cream. I only had the cauliflower and cod. Cauliflower looked good and was a big portion for $12 but lacked seasoning (although I'll admit I eat salty :), cod was quite good. Didn't have the short ribs but for $58 I would've expected a bigger portion and based on my taste of the vegetables on the side it also lacked seasoning. Desserts were good but not sure if it's really worth $15-18 each. Overall the experience was good. The Library provided a very nice environment for an intimate and enjoyable dinner. I don't think I'd come back specifically for the food, but it's nice to have the option of a bar snack when having a drink at the library and to have nice and attentive staff.

I was at this restaurant only five minutes ago, and I am now eating a block of stinky cheese to get over how bland the food was. It is really disappointing that for the prices they charge, the quality of the food is low. low. low. This restaurant will go down as the worst of 2016, so far.The kurobuta pork was dry and a sad attempt at making thick-cut ham, the greens were wilted and bland, and the sauce tasted like banana mash. The cauliflower with Manchego is a joke, thick slices of cauliflower with some cheese on top, they should have fried these in fat and added some garlic, or anything to add flavor to the dish, and had it under the broiler for a longer period of time.As a person who cooks and takes good care of his customers, I can't believe no one from the team ever said something about the food they serve. We all need to make money but consumers deserve to have something back, for the price of that meal, I've never felt this shortchanged. I demand my money back
4
Awesome food though limited variety on the weekend. Chef is a gentleman and great at his job. Drinks esp the Yogi Yogi was awesome . Wish they had a pitcher of drinks to share facility
Overall great food ambience and service
1
The menu was very limited. It was a particularly Poor menu for vegetarians. One choice: Mac and cheese. The menu has changed since my last visit in February. Really disappointed.
1
Seriously disappointing visit. The portions were very small and food was not tasty. Beef ribs lacked taste, cod was not fresh. Fries tasted over cooked, baked cauliflower was ordinary. The best part of the restaurant was the decor.
2
food was average, we had the fresh oysters, atlantic cod and kurobuta pork cheek. Pork cheek was lukewarm when they served it to our table. We were unsatisfied after this meal and went next door for more filling nasi padang.
4
Nice ambience with interesting menu for the palate but probably not something you like to have on a daily basis. Good atmosphere for couple time. House red was good. You can take a stroll to Chinatown to check out the shops after dinner
5
I love the food !
I like the open kitchen, you get to see the chefs in action! I highly recommend the fish&chips.
The service is super friendly!
5
My husband and I ate at The Study last night and had a fantastic experience. We've been twice before as well, once for brunch and one for dinner, and were equally impressed with the food and service on all three of our visits. This time we were particularly impressed with our main courses, the pork collar and beef short rib, which were both perfectly prepared, flavourful and extremely tender. The triple cooked chips that we ordered as a side were amazingly crisp and delicious. And desserts, which are always a highlight for me, were equally fantastic, particularly my cherry bakewell tart with smoked almond ice cream that tasted almost like peanut butter and complimented the cherry tart perfectly. They have recently hired a new head chef and its seems from our experiences last night that he's doing a great job living up to the standards set by the previous one. We were equally impressed with the service, especially from the lovely woman I think was the restaurant manager and who was out on the floor helping the servers tend to the diners. She was kind and very accommodating, as well as knowledgable about the restaurant and its food. The servers were great as well, very attentive and friendly. They were always on top of refilling our water and clearing our plates, and checking to make sure our food was up to standard. Overall we've had three great experiences at The Study and look forward to our next visit
5
I had a top experience at the study and I'll tell you why.Firstly, an affordable lunch price was a sure pull-in. I opted for the 3 course menu and I finished licking every plate clean. Even a classic such as the fish and chips was spot on, loved the presentation. To boot, Chef Daniel made time to say hello to every table and that personalized touch was the ice cream on top of the cherry cake. Cheers The Study team. You've got a new fan
3
Went here for dinner. This is a small, cosy restaurant with a good reputation for English food with a Singapore twist. The menu is modest but there is enough choice for most. Whilst the quality was good we all felt that the portion size, especially the main courses bordered on miserly. Service was a bit slow which was recognised by the team and they provided an extra side order and a complimentary glass of wine each. Full marks for that. At ten thirty they close the doors and slide back the wall between The Study and the adjacent bar called the library. At that point the noise levels will rise but eating should have been completed by then. Oh yes, if you want the bathroom you'll be given a card to get into the next door bar. All a bit quirky but fun. Overall however given the prices and the very modest main course ( the scotch egg starter is big than the main course fish portion) it is no better than average
5
Had a great night at this restaurant in Singapore serving British food with an Asian twist. After cocktails on arrival we were informed by our friendly waiter that a new menu was being unveiled that evening. To start I had garden vegetables and my companion had cured sardines, both excellent. The main courses were even better, Atlantic cod and grilled mackerel with a side dish of triple cooked chips, washed down with two glasses of Muscadet, a great wine with fish. The presentation was fantastic and the fish was very fresh, flown in that morning. For dessert we had white chocolate bread and butter pudding and sorbet and ice cream. A nice touch was that the head chef, Danial came to our table to get feedback on the new menu. One disappointment was that we had to remind our waiter that we'd ordered a side dish so it didn't arrive until we were well into our main courses. But this didn't spoil a lovely evening in a great restaurant.
5
Loved the food. They just switched up their menu and it is just as good as their previous one. Try the salted cod or the scotch egg! Also check out the restroom - it's quite a fun surprise.
5
only one word to describe this place - AWESOME!
good food, great service, what more is there to say =D
Many thanks!!
- Jim and Jane

My friend living in Singapore took me there when I visited
What a cool place with fabulous food
Omg the donuts for dessert were delicious
Not touristy which is great
4
Great service and ambience. The Study clubbed with 'the library' was a perfect experience. However wished they had more options in the menu for vegetarians.
4
Portions are smaller than average. Salmon was fresh. Excellent service. Reservations recommended....
4
Had lunch with 4 others, taking the set lunch fare. Starters, mains, dessert. All nicely presented, though one very hungry companion stated the portions were small! There was "Surf & Turf" (lobster claws and steak), the every popular fish and chips, and vegetarian options as well. Taste was good and reasonably well executed, though fish could have been more crispy. The starters varied in size according to the price of the ingredients - the cauliflower in cheese was a large portion, and interestingly done, while the scallops starter was small. Ambience was cosy and not noisy, and service was brisk but friendly. Coffee / tea included in price. Overall, nice for a leisurely lunch
2
We took the lunch menu who seems to be a good value. But it was not.The starter (ceviche) was very good.But the burger... overcooked, dry and you just have a burger in the center of your plate and nothing else. No salad, no chips, no vegetables. You have to pay S$5 for the (very good!) french fries.The wine was ok but terribly expensive for this kind of quality.So not a good value, food is not really good
4
...when no too many are in this cute but also small restaurant. It can be packed at times.When we visited there was almost only us.The staff is really friendly, the food yum (although the prices are very high compared to the size of your plate) and the drinks are cool (as some beer is offered in tin cups or sth like that....you feel like a knight for some reason).Please make sure to use the toilet. Not kidding...I wont tell you why, just do it!!!!
4
Nice food, creative choices, done with passion, very nice staff, great service!One small suggestion, do make it clear that the mains are served as described and sides have to be ordered separately. It's a pity to order it and get the sides 10 minutes after the main course.
5
The wallet hurt, the mouth watered. Incredible scotch egg followed by sea bass. I had serious food envy and thanked my lucky stars that my girlfriend didn't mind sharing her meal. Definitely had to make that back up later! Wine is fairly priced and the chef was great to speak to. Spike with him in the sister-bar next door for a while after
4
Great fun buzzy restaurant. Service and atmosphere very good. Food very good. Like the way the restaurant becomes the bar.
4
Love the atmosphere and the link between the study and the library bar. Both fun venues. The food was enjoyable and I have a feeling this restaurant will go from strength to strength as it finds its niche!
4
Visited for lunch and enjoyed a three course lunch for S$35++. All foods are carefully prepared and decorated neatly. I also like the warm decor, makes you feel like visting friend's home. Value for price. Will visit again.
4
I visited The Study for lunch on a week day, it seemed fairly new and was very quiet. The waiter/manager was very attentive and talked us through the set menu which was all very good.The service was fast and we were not rushed. It was not a cheap meal but compared with some places in Singapore I'd say it was good value. I'd advise this to anyone looking for something away from the touristy places
4
Was there with a couple of friends on a Saturday night. Quaint restaurant with an open kitchen/bar concept. Scotch egg appetiser was yummy.Ask for head chef Danial's special amuse bouche - truffle savoury choux. Delicious. Also the donuts with salted caramel cream were to die for. Had to resist ordering second
4
I had banana french toast and sausages - it tasted wonderful. My friends ordered the pancake and some cinnamon donuts. Didnt manage to try those but they looked a bit dull for the price on the menu.Place is quiet, nice deco and lovely for brunch or a tea break to catch up with friend
2
Not the type of place I want to visit while in Singapore but my colleague suggested it. Was very busy so we sat at the bar. 30 minutes before we could give our order. To start, my colleague had the scallops which he loved yet was worried about food poisoning so not a good start. I ordered the pork and it was so dissatisfying. No imagination at all. Typical dried pork and veg. Mac and cheese was the second main. 2 glasses of OK wine and 2 cocktails. â‚¬170 . Never agai
4
Arrives at 11 plus on a Saturday and they had a limited menu for brunch. Was a little dissapointed as I wanted to try something more substantial. I opted for the honey muesli with truffle milk. The truffle was a little overwhelming at first but it got better with more milk. I saw a layer of truffle oil in the milk container. Perhaps if the truffle is mixed thoroughly with the truffle oil, then what do I know... I'm not a chef :-)Overall a nice place to catch up with friends but I felt that the brunch menu is more for those couples to whisper sweet nothings to each other while enjoying a meal together and not for those who really want to try out the team's culinary creation
3
The place is nice, but when we were there (on a Wednesday) it was only us and another couple. The bill ended at 378 sg dollar. Was it worth it? Not really. I don't think I will be back. It's good, but for that price you're expecting something extra
5
The food is good and special.The seating and place and the staff make an effort to put us in a corner for a little birthday celebration and bothered to arrange a cake for the occasion. The furniture could have been better but made up by the good service.Overall is excellent for the evenin
5
It's beautifully curated menu items that doesn't break your wallet if you want that little bit of fancy. Highly recommend. Every dish was not short of spectacular.
5
The food was great, lunch set is good value and the chef came around to say hi which was very thoughtful and cool.
5
Must try food in The Study from the celebrity chef.
Everything was perfect. Highly recommend to try brocconcini salad and steak with pudding.
2
We ate here on a week night after hearing good things from colleagues. We ordered the squid (good portion but very bland) and the ceviche (again, fairly bland) to start, followed by the sea bass (very tasty but bizarrely small portion for the price) and the salmon (not too bad). Throw in a few glasses of wine and we broke $200. All in all, it felt very expensive for what it was
4
Firstly, the service is commendable which made the dining experience surprisingly pleasant thru out our meal. Next, the menu is away-from-the-usual English fare, lots of thoughts have gone into preparing the dishes... the iberico pork mixed with foie gras scotch egg was not oily and the duck fat (which is not exactly healthy) was not overwhelming, the earl grey poached salmon - this dish turned out too salty - it tasted like smoked salmon - this is when the highly observant manager came by and asked for feedback. She offered to change the dish without us requesting although we were mid way thru the dish. We had the pan-fried seabass instead. We were extremely appreciative. The sirloin steak was prepared - medium to our liking. Lastly, strawberry with yogurt on peppered bread coupled with raspberry sorbet ended the meal nicely. Must say the meal is a little pricey but with such service, food and the accompany of your spouse and family, its worth it. PS: we gave tips on and above the 10%service charge which we rarely do..
5
My friends and I chose this place to have a good meal, and we were impressed with the food quality as well as the ambiance! Their staff was very well-mannered and very mindful of our needs and requests.We ordered 1 starter, 4 mains, two sides and it ended up costing a fair amount, so you get what you paid for-- and it's all good :)Ps: My friends thought the steak was excellent, but I loved the salmon. 10/10
2
Had Breakfast here whilst staying at the Naumi Liora Hotel next door as the hotel doesn't serve breakfast. I was told they served an American Breakfast but in actual fact, there was a very poor selection of self service items and no eggs. The coffee was barely recognisable as coffee and tasted like very watered down instant coffee and the bread for toast was supermarket sliced bread. Very disappointing and certainly not what I expected from what looked like a very nice restaurant especially as the hotel recommended it for it's 'American Breakfast
5
Went again to The Study since this is now my favourite restaurant in Singapore. Service staff were attentive and excellent and best of all, the food is truly good. They have a seasonal menu that changes every few months but they do have a few fan-favourite dishes (like Devil's Eggs and the every delicious cinnamon donut dessert) that is always on the menu. Had the Seabass with truffle gnocchi this time and it was divine. Absolutely loved it!Fan-Tip: Sit at the bar counter so that you can watch the chefs cook ala Hell's Kitchen style although because of the overhanging lamps, it may be warm to sit there. But it's oh-so entertaining
5
Didn't know there was much to English cooking except fish and chips but we had a very ice meal here. Grilled salmon was great but I really liked the beetroot gel. Service was very nice and efficient and they put up with Mr Fussy the 8 yea old happily. He was very positive about the quality of the chips, and he is a chip expert. Not cheap but hey, Singapore is not cheap
5
A hidden gem. Very inviting with superb service. We ate there twice, once for brunch on Saturday morning and once for dinner on a Tuesday. Brunch was simply exquisite. Dinner was superb. All freshly cooked and perfect, beautifully presented. Pleasing to both the eye and the palate. The chef, Seamus, is an undoubtedly talented man and Luke the General Manager is attentive with a fine eye for detail. I commend The Study to you. You won't be disappointed
4
Not too many words, The Study is a nice place where to get good and intetesting food. Great ambience, located in a very popular mall. Service is good as well.
4
Try the salmon and the quid, quality food but not cheap. Do give it a try, get the password from your waiter to get into the bar next door "library"
3
Good food but lousy service and lack of concern when you guys messed up my reservation
Nevertheless the food was decent if not a little pricey but what do you expect in Singapore
3
I really wanted to like The Study a lot. I had been here before when it was a different restaurant, still run by Unlisted/Jason Atherton, and it didn't really work. The space is still awkward and the kitchen is very small so they have tried to go for a sort of modern British fine dining approach, with a small menu and relaxed decor and service. It doesn't quire work. We had no starters, two main courses, two side dishes and shared a pudding. With a bottle of the house white it came to $240. The food was very pleasant but it isn't great value for money in a small, very casual, room. I enjoyed my sea bass with truffled gnocchi and my wife's beef was perfectly medium rare as ordered, but it lacked a punch of flavour. Portions weren't large but were adequate with the side dishes. Triple cooked chips were nice but tasted too much of the deep fat fryer and the kale and pinenuts was a simple dish that would have been improved by the buttered leeks that should have gone with it, but which they were out of. The doughnuts with chantilly cream were very moreish but I don't think they got the texture of the dough quite right. Maybe it is a difficult space to make work but the food isn't quite where it should be
4
Dining here is quite an experience. First of all, its located at the fringes of Chinatown along Keong Saik road. Secondly, its not noticable from the outside so you have to keep your eyes peeled as you walk along the restored shop houses to find this place. Thirdly, when you enter the restaurant, you'll notice that its not very large, so the seating is very intimate but cozy. The staff was extremely helpful and hospitable. It was a busy night so they let us eat at the bar counter which was just next to the kitchen. So we had the opportunity to watch the chef and his assistant prepare our meal.The food was divine. The drinks interesting.Best of all, after dinner, the Study actually had a secret entrance that leads to the bar called the Library. Also, if you have to enter the Library through the main entrance, you have to have a secret password. This you can get if you dine at the Study.Overall, I really enjoyed the dining experience here. it may be $$$ but its worth it
4
Food was one of the best Western we have tasted in Singapore. Service was very friendly and slick. Place is cool although the table was a bit small and the place therefore a tad noisy. Great night out nevertheless

Throughly enjoyed our evening at The Study to celebrate our anniversary. Scallops were divine as was the sea bass. The service was excellent and the atmosphere made for a great evening. We asked for the password to The Library bar next door and finished off the night with some unique cocktails. Well worth the money, we will visit again. Thank you!

This is a small, cozy place with plenty of privacy, yet very attentive and hospitable staff. We loved the theme and decoration, it's very comfortable and romantic. The food and wine are amazing, dishes were proudly served by the chefs themselves. I guess the only downside would be that the (unisex) restroom is in the next building inside a bar

Service was excellent! I made a RSVP via chope for my mum's birthday lunch & was given a great seat with view and after I paid and wanted to leave, they surprised us with a complimentary dessert for my mum's birthday! The gesture from the manager (I believer her name is Kathy) was indeed heart-warming. She even address me by my name :) great service indeed! Food was excellent as well!

We ate breakfast at The Study on three mornings having purchased vouchers from the Naumi Liora Hotel, which is next door, where we were staying, and doesn't serve breakfast.The interior is very dark and has an eclectic mix of books, mirrors, ornaments, etc which is interesting.Breakfast was a limited self-service Continental selection which was adequate although not inspirational.We had little contact with staff who didn't seem to find it necessary to engage with customers
5
If you visit Singapore, you must visit The Study for a meal. Do it. Do it. Do it. Do it. Do it. Do it. Do it.

Excellent food but some will find the portions too small. Personally a starter and main were just about right and the quality of the ingredients and cooking were superb. Knowledgeable service also.
5
This is a great little restaurant with a very accomplished chef,and there's an interesting connected bar next door,the Library.Starters included foie gras scotch egg; brawn terrine.I had Wagyu beef as my main. It was good but,my one criticism,a little chewy at the end; we also had pork collar, and sea bass. Both good.I don't normally do desserts but I was persuaded to. Excellent.Never had Uruguayan red wine before. Even that was very drinkable.And then for drinks next door.............

Food: A brunch freak like me, I go around town to try different brunch on every weekend, by far Study serve the best brunch menu (please go for 3eggs full english breakfast), the food is really fresh and very fulfilling with good value. Drinks: Personally I am not a big fan of their cocktails (from Library) and last time their bartender was sick so didnt try their drinks until this time. Taste as usual, very cough syrup and sweet (may good for the ladies) and their in-house Bloody-Mary mix is just bizzare and the drink taste like coca-cola. Others may like it but just not mine

I had a lunch meeting this past week and decided to give The Study a try as they had a reasonably priced set lunch menu (2 courses - S$30++; 3 courses - S$35++) and it also happens to be a "cousin" of one of my favorite dining spots in Hong Kong, 22 Ships. The food here is top notch. For starters, I started with the Iberico pork and foie gras scotch egg with pickled beetroot whilst my dining companions started off with the heirloom tomato salad with truffle burrata and sherry shallot vinegar. My scotch egg was an excellent combination of ingredients: a bit of saltiness from the pork, a nicely cooked soft boiled egg in the center, with a nice hit of acid from the pickled beetroot. The heirloom tomato salad, I was told, was also excellent although I sadly didn't get to try any!For the mains, both my friends had the beef burger which they said was absolutely excellent and really good quality. I opted for the roasted pumpkin, truffle potato gnocchi with kale and basil pesto. My dish was packed with flavor, although there were a lot of elements on the plate and the dish could have been a bit more cohesive, the flavors were spot on. The real icing on the cake though was dessert (pun intended). Two of us opted for the doughnuts with cinnamon sugar and salted caramel cream which were absolutely DIVINE. Our other friend got the warm vanilla rice pudding with mango sorbet and mango mint dressing which was also sinfully delicious. The service here is top notch and really sets The Study apart in my opinion. They had messed up on making one of the doughnut orders and -without us even asking- gave us a complimentary cheesecake dish on the house to atone for the delay. That to me is a sign of a restaurant that values quality service and a good customer experience vs. someplace that is just there to make a quick buck and turn out dishes to the masses. This is perhaps one of the best set lunch menus I have had in Singapore; you can't really beat the value for three courses of high quality food. In sum, the food, the value and the service here is top notch and I would highly recommend The Study for a meal and look forward to returning again soon

Excellent food and service. Enough choices in the lunch menu, however the portions should be a tiny bit bigger to be perfect
5
Loved this restaurant, the food was delicious, the eraser ice was second to none and the twist with the rest rooms and bar was a really quirky twist, love it, if you go to Singapore you should at least go for a drink here

This is a small restaurant decorated in a quirky English style with a menu that is largely English inspired if you ignore the burger and gnocchi options. We made the mistake of choosing only a main course and dessert. You need all three courses to come out feeling like you've had a good meal. In our group we had the wagyu beef, the lamb and gnocchi. Everyone enjoyed the flavours and presentation. Both meat dishes were cooked beautifully but even with a couple of side dishes of fries we all wanted more. Two of our group are not big eaters, but even they would have liked a bigger plate.We selected four desserts; vanilla and mango rice pudding, a bakewell tart, cheesecake and I chose the chocolate dessert that we were advised takes 15 minutes. My advice is don't bother waiting, the other desserts were delicious whilst my chocolate cake was rather dry and disappointing.Wines by the glass range from $18 to $21 with a small but interesting choice. Service was friendly, professional and prompt.We completed our evening in their "speakeasy" style bar next door. All in all a very pleasant evening even if we did have to have something to eat when we got home

Very cosy little restaurant in Chinatown with a good selection of English styleFood but with a bit of flair. Atmosphere is pretty relaxed as was the service, there seemed to be a few in training but very friendly and so was the restaurant manager. The food is actually very reasonably priced, the music was laid back jazz, we forgot where we were when we walked out into the street

I was staying at the 'Naumi Liora Hotel' in the Keong Saik Road area of Chinatown and this restaurant is right next door and so I decided to give it a try. My first attempt on a Saturday night, walking in with no reservation, was unsuccessful but I did manage to get a reservation for 7:30pm the following night, Sunday 15th March. You really should book as it is a very intimate restaurant with not many tables and a very unique riveted copper counter which gives an industrial-chic vibe. As I was dining solo I opted to sit at the counter and watch the action in the open kitchen. This was a good spot as I got to communicate with the two English Chef's and watching them at work was both an education and entertaining. There are a couple of tables outside but to be honest it is simply too hot and humid in Singapore to eat this kind of food outside on the pavement.The food at 'The Study' is inspired by classic British comfort food all served up with great presentation with attention to detail and the perfect combination of texture and flavour. I choose the 'Scotch Egg' to start which was served on a beetroot and leaf salad and it was absolutely superb. For my main I had the 'Lamb Loin' which was served with a Yorkshire Pudding and a few token carrots and greens, more as decoration than as your 5-a-day. The lamb was very good but I would not stretch to excellent, I think a bit more lamb would have been nice as the amount of meat on the plate was small and at SG$35.00 (about GB£17.50) it could have dome with an extra piece or two. I had a side order of 'Duck Fat Chips' which were very good indeed. To finish I had the 'Bakewell Tart' which again was a superbly executed good old English pudding... Delicious.In short this is a great restaurant with a very unique décor and superb atmospheric ambience, the food was great, the staff were great and I highly recommend it... The only thing that was not great was that in my mind it is just a little over-priced, but hey it is Singapore! Also worth a mention is that there is a 'hidden' bar next door as well called the Library which The Study cooks the bar snacks for... Did not get to try it this trip but want to next visit as that also is meant to be very unique

As a final hurrah before my father left Singapore to go home, we tried The Study as I noticed it when walking around the area the day before. I often rate a restaurant by the people who work there, and honestly they were fantastic. We had a table for five which included my family (Wife and two kids aged 5 and 3), my father and I. There was nothing but smiles from the staff and they often engaged the kids rather than ignore them which made them feel special. There are no kids meals here, but I wouldn't have it any other way, the kids loved the dishes they tried, especially the Scotch Eggs (Must Try), which my daughter called the meat balls (much to the chefs delight), and the fish and chips.We adults all had the lamb, which was very nicely prepared, the fact it had Yorkshire pudding with it was a special treat, although my wife said she would have liked some additional gravy to go with it.The only disappointments for the night was that the restaurant didn't have any beef that night, and they confused my desert order, but these things happen and I wouldn't classify this as a big issue.This is a great restaurant and one which I am happy to say the kids and us really enjoyed

Great setting. Lively buzz. Stunning food equal to any Michelin star food I've eaten. Minor negatives, a bit cramped and an oddball selection of beers

We went to 'the study' to celebrate my birthday after being recommended by a friend and we were not disappointed!! We really enjoyed our food and the menu had a great selection of dishes. The service was faultless and the atmosphere was chilled and trendy. A particular mention must go to my chocolate sponge dessert with spiced pears and hazel nut ice cream, it was delicious!! After paying the bill we then asked for the password for the bar next door 'the libary'. The bar itself is very cool with excellent alternative decor and the cocktail menu was very unique, designed specifically for the bar. Expensive but definitely worth it for the novelty and a great way to end the evening. We are already planning to go back with our friends!!

The Study is a tiny restaurant owned by a British-based Michelin-starred chef, Jason Atherton, and currently run by a young man who trained with Heston Blumenthal at Bray. You come with high expectations, and they are met. We came during Chinese New and the usual British-themed menu had been replaced with a Chinese-inspired set menu, which was excellent - a pork slider of belly pork in a steamed rice bun was terrific. The atmosphere and setting are nicely unstuffy and the service personable. As a bonus, customers get a password to the 'secret' bar next door, The Library

Decided to try this place, being in the top 100 here on tripadvisor. Vaguely remember this was from a celebrity chef and later read that it is jason athertonParking is always going to be a challenge here, so make time for that. They have 2 set lunches and a la carte, and we went for the 3 course business lunch. I started with scotch eggs which i've never had before. Didn't taste or see the foie gras, but overall it was delicious enough. My friend also seemed to like her calamariMy burger main was good,but not outstanding. My friend again her seabass and chips. My dessert of doughnuts was a large serving of 2 giant doughnuts and it was very good. My friend liked her bakewell tart. Even tea and coffee was included in the setOverall for $35, what a delicious and value for money lunch. Is it 3 michelin? Probably not, but I'll be bac

Recommended to me by a dear friend, it ticked all the boxes for a great night out with my partner - fantastic food, healthy and fresh components to each dish, warm and inviting, and whoever wrote the cocktail menu has a sense of humour I enjoyed. If you're into spicy, try the "Mary had a little lamb" cocktail.Highly recommend the beetroot cured salmon entree and sea bass for main. I opted for a gluten free version, and my sea bass came with duck fat cooked thick fries (these taste amazing!). My partner enjoyed his calamari for entree and fancy with an "old fashioned twist" hamburger.Service was excellent and wished we had the time to try The Library (speakeasy inspired bar) next door.Next time..

Work/fun dinner for the Buy Me A Drink App team on a Monday. We sat at the bar, the first thing you notice is the design of the place and a very handsome chef running the show in an open kitchen. We decided to not even look at the menu and let the chef feed us, great idea by the way. But first the drinks! One particular green creation caught out eye. Have you ever tried a Green Pea Cocktail? That's tight it was the first time for us too. You can taste the pea but it is very subtle and the drink is a bit sour which we really like. The rest of the evening was champagne. Good narrow selection of bottles. Food got started with fried calamari and the duck rillette both lovely. One other started really capture our attention, a burratta salad with a hint of truffle. Superb and refreshing great balance for the heavier options on the table. Mains came shortly after we had the beef wagyu and the sea bass. The sides were a bit of an over ordering mishap but we enjoyed them very much. Pumpkin and fries... Fried in duck fat. How can one resist? We left with a parting gift of salty chocolate balls :) we are still debating if that was a South Park reference or a funny coincidence Overall experience was great and service was fantastic.

A regular haunt when in Singapore every month and one that never fails to please; warm, welcoming, fun sense of service with some amazing staff, not to mention one of the nicest bars in Singapore next door ( 'The Study' ) which is also under the same umbrella.Chef Ayo never ceases to deliver, and his food passion shows through on every plate with care, his only sin is the ability to blow away even the most ardent diet plans , normally shattered at the last with a serving of Salt Caramel Creme and fresh doughnuts.Great team , led my Paul Bradley now in the bar, who can deliver awesome cocktails, bar theatre and mood ...The trick is making it through the tailors shop !

Was very much looking forward to going here as I wanted to try a Jason Atherton restaurant while in Singapore and Pollen was too expensive and la Esquina closed Sunday night so this seemed the best option...sadly it was not and as a consequence not sure I'd try another of Jason's places if he's happy to put his name to this one...The waiting staff are not to be faulted...very friendly and efficient service. Was a Sunday night so very quiet - starter came pretty fast, bit of a wait for mains and had to order deserts in advance as kitchen was closing...For starter we had the scotch egg which was good, not remarkable...and we also had the salt and pepper squid which was terrible! Oily and not very tasty at all...more batter than squid...couldn't eat much of it at all. For mains we had the lamb and the wagyu beef and a side of thrice cooked chips. Chips arrived way in advance of mains and again were greasy...would suggest chefs oil not hot enough for deep frying. Mains looked pretty on the plate, but boy were they small! I mean really small! Lamb was just two slices of loin about a cm thick and beef by weight must have been about 50g. If they were dishes on a 7 course degustation menu would be fine, but as a full main course dish really not value for money.Bakewell tart for dessert was best course of the night - rice pudding ok, but again nothing specialSo, we won't be back and wouldn't recommend either. Sorry Jason....I wanted to like it

Been there once before and had a great experience, came on a Sunday this time, limited menu, very slow service, average burger, my friend had the BLT and it looked pathetic, 2 small overcooked pieces of bacon, very disappointing for the price we paid. Sad because I want to support good well cooked English food here in Singapore, as it isn't often done well.I won't be returning I'm sad to say. Shame, as I booked it specially for my friends hoping they would be impressed too. They were not....
5
Beautiful food, cute setting, delightful staff (lovely head chef from the UK came over to personally greet us) and amaxing value!!
5
The always great Study (and connected speakeasy The Library) is always great, but the addition of new Brit head Chef Ayo has taken the food and experience to another level.
4
Took some friends to celebrate my husbands birthday. Restaurant is small but interesting, staff were attentive but not overly so. Starters were very tasty - the 'scotch egg' in particular was excellent. Mains were beautifully presented - everything was eaten. The restaurant gave us a glass of champagne to start on the house and their Bakewell tart as a the birthday cake disappeared off the plate very quickly
5
The best meal I had in Singapore. After a few hits (the hawkers market) and misses (the white rabbit), the Study really really impressed. We booked early on New Year's Eve. Grabbing a couple seats by the bar we had full interaction with Chef Ayo and his staff. Coming early probably helped as we saw all of their early prep and were able to watch through the night the way they prepared as well as watching the chef schooling his crew in some of the finer points of service. Chef regaled us with stories of his background and we had a great discussion about knives and his use of lamb fat! I was impressed as we sat down to some roots manuva blasting away followed by a greatest hits of 90s hip hop. A perfect way to set the Eve tone. We shared the scotch egg and heirloom tomato salad. Both were excellent. Tomatoes in this part of the world are hard to find. These were fine set off by some excellent frisÃ©e and truffled burrata. The scotch egg was as advertised. Held together by a juicy pork exterior. Clearly a signature dish. Next up was the special : turkey with bread sauce. My step mom with her UK heritage waist fascinated by tiebreaks sauce with was tasty bright and set off the sous-vide turkey perfectly. My lamb was excellent - cooked to perfection and seasoned perfectly. The only disappointment was the leek, kale and pine nut side. A bit limp and watery. Finally ended with a very creamy rice pudding and tasty mango sorbet. Excellent unobtrusive service and access to their fun speakeasy next door. Highly recommend. You get a chef's table with no extra cost!!

From the food to the service to the ambience, my dining experience at The Study was a thoroughly enjoyable one. The restaurant staff greeted us with warmth and did everything to make sure our time in the restaurant was a memorable one. We had the confit duck on sourdough toast for starters and the Beef burger and the roasted lambs for mains. Each was delectable, with a lot of attention give to detail
5
We ended up in this restaurant by accident really. Without any reservations they sat us at the bar, which was actually great. We were able to be in close encounter with the kitchen staff and the chef himself. The chef surprised us with some 'pigs in a blanket' and he took the time for some conversation. Definitely worth a visit, whether its for business, with friends, or even a bit of romance

Christmas Season so a good idea to try The Study for a Friday lunch or so we thought.The ambience and style is attractively basic and even rustic in that old school room style that you remember from your youth or at least I did. The service was friendly to a fault and overall very efficient as well as patient as we dithered over the lunch specials. Seeing we were hungry our waiter advised us discretely that if we were truly hungry we should go 'off piste' ie a la carte which we did as we were also told lunch portions were 'modest' but a la carte more substantial. Makes sense right? We all opted for the Iberico pork and foie gras scotch egg, with pickled beetroot which was excellent although perhaps the foie gras was present in spirit only as it was so sparingly included as to be undetectable. Mains were baked sea bass, truffle potato gnocchi, leeks with charred onions again excellent but less so the English ale snapper fish and chips, mushy peas !! The fish was succulent and good but the chips were semi cremated being deep brown in colour and the mushy peas like tasteless baby food in taste and texture. The doughnuts and vanilla rice pudding were OK at best ,the rice pudding especially looking as if it had been standing around a few hours before serving being crusty as in a skin over the top and not the type you wanted.An off day? Maybe. Would I go again ? Probably. However as a 'regular' at the other establishments and therefore expecting the same calibre of food as say Esquina,Pollen or Pollen Street Social this is nowhere near them,nowhere
5
I had visited The Study before and my friends and I visit it again for my birthday. Yet again, The wonderful service staff and chefs at The Study at Keong Saik Road did not disappoint us. The food was excellent, made with love and passion plus the service was attentive.I love the attention to detail that Chef AYO has for the meal including presentation and the taste of the dishes. Hats off to the Chef AYO who was wonderfully hospitable, friendly and charming. Had a wonderful time for my birthday meal with friends at The Study and I will definitely recommend the restaurant to anyone
5
Hats off to Nicholas Quattroville for designing brunch for my guest who is gluten, dairy, egg, and pork free---when the regular menu selection was not working. Appreciate the extra effort and creativity involved--and for then, letting us test a couple of new cocktail ideas
5
Stumbled on to this place while walking around and decided to head back for dinner. Loved everything about the place. Great music, friendly and professional service and some brilliant food. Started with a Beetroot cured Salmon and a Confit Duck Rillettes both amazing. A burger cooked beautifully to med rare and the gnocchi. Finished this off with a serve of donuts. All portions are perfect size and could have skipped dessert but donuts with salted caramel cream were to good to go past. Would go back again for sure and would recomend to anyone looking for a great place to have a meal and some drinks. P.S. Has the best trip to the toilet of any place I have ever been a really nice touch
5
Food and ambience is great. Eaten there for breakfast, lunch and dinner and all occassions have been excellent.

Just came back from brunch at the study and was so impressed! The food is spot on !! Being british I have struggled to find a decent full English breakfast in singapore but the study has got it spot on! We chatted to the chef (from reading not sure on name-sorry I'm bad with names!) he came to introduce himself and got chatting about the perfect sausage for a fry up and how he has gone out of his way to get the best - and he has succeeded! Bakewell tart is excellent- the sort where you are so full up but consider ordering another because so good!Food was really very good and excellent value, service was top rate and chef here just makes you want to come back as so friendly- and we will def be coming back for dinner next time -I hear there are Yorkshire puddings on the menu- book me in !Chilled atmosphere with quirky decoration and great music.Only minor complaint was friends french toast a little wet in middle from bananas- but easily fixed.If you haven't been then I highly recommend it

Managed to get round to eating here today. What a very pleasant surprise! The staff are just wonderful, really chilled out but not too over familiar. Great service is hard to find in Singapore, and these guys were on point. The food. We over ate but it was impossible not to. For our starters we had the pork and foie gras scotch eggs and a bowl of salt and pepper squid with chilli. I have to say squid was on par with what we've eaten in Sicily so we were quite happy; crispy, well seasoned and the chilli added a slight kick. I like my chillies with the seeds and all, but that's specific for different people. The hubby assured me the scotch eggs were tasty ... We hardly spoke while scoffing our starters if I'm honest. I would say that the squid is enough for two people, but then you'd be missing out on something else on the menu. For mains the hubby ordered the British ale snapper and triple cooked duck fat chips while i decided to stick to steak, with a side order of asparagus. I don't know how the chef managed it but the fish was sublime - snapper doesn't tend to taste so meaty and yet it tasted as such. I do have one small gripe, sorry! The duck fat chips. We really did expect these to be crispy on the outside, yes these bordered on chip shop soggy. Now I don't have anything against chip fat chips (love 'em) but we've had triple cooked duck fat chips before and they were crispy and very soft inside. Maybe we've been spoilt or perhaps they are supposed to be like that. The flavour was great, as was the overall presentation. My steak and onion rings were 10/10, no complaints. The onion rings were divine and my medium rare steak was cooked and sliced to perfection. Faultless. Where The Study won our hearts was with pudding. Homemade Bakewell tart and doughnuts. The tart was reminiscent of freshly baked goodness with a dollop of ice cream on the side, while the doughnuts were fresh from the oven, warm and steamy once torn into, with a generous side of Chantilly cream incase we were lacking more wholesome goodness. Really took me back home. We met the chef who popped out to speak to the customers and we spoke for a bit. Really lovely chap and whose name we forget, sorry! Wanted to invite him over to ours for a taste of a proper home cooked British curry but we missed our chance. Thank you for a lovely meal, the exceptional service, fabulous atmosphere and for making us feel at home. We'll be back for another visit and we'll be sure to tell our friends

Day 3 of our Singapore trip dinner restaurant, originally we were going to Burnt Ends but the restaurant was fully booked we can't get a seat until 930pm amazingly mind boggling, we walk across the street the is a tiny restaurant name The Study, we talk a chance on it, and it turns out to be another gems yet to be discover, the dinner was great, service was good, food was great, we have the starters and a bottle of wine to share, we have our own individual mains, and we ordered all the dessert and share, great experience, nice restaurant set up SGD650+ for 4 person. And remember guys, after your dinner, go down the same street go to a place call The Library, show them that you have dine in The Study and you will get a surprise... Don't miss it
4
Celebrated my partner's birthday at the restaurant. They gave us a surprise cake on the house. Made our day! Even I did not expect it.I had the squid and scallop with rice. Amazing flavour and the squid was just nicely grilled. Crunchy light and just so yummy. The scallops were also imecca by done.My partner had the English Ale Fish N Chips. The fries were ok but the fish was a tad bland. But overall I would say this place is worth coming back a second time for the ambience, food quality and impeccably personal top notch service
5
The Study is another addition to cool-chic in Singapore. An excellent meal, with wonderful service in funky surrounds. English cuisine (which I thought didnt exist!) with a shrewd twist. Great experience
5
An utterly enjoyable experience.Four of us booked late and only the counter seats were available; I am quite confident these are the best seats in the house. Cosy enough to speak to your friends but right in the middle of all the action. The chef is very meticiculos about the standard of food and wouldn't let it be served if it wasn't perfect.Plenty of atmosphere and very accommodating staff with a fun bar next door to go afterwards

The Study is another of the hip restaurants in Singapore located along Keong Saik Street right under the Keong Saik Hotel itself serving modern takes on English Food, from Devil's Eggs to Fish & Chips. The restaurant decor and ambience is casual with a modern twist with bronze baskets holding up plates and a bronze countertop overlooking the chef's kitchen area. The restaurant is opened by a Chef/Restauranteur Chef Jason from the UK but for Singapore, Chef Ano is heading the restaurant who hails from Reading, just outside London U.K. We had the appetizers like the Cauliflower soup with cheese toast as well as Devil's Eggs which melts in your mouth. The entre that i had was the special of the day which is Waygu beef with Bone Marrow salad and fries. The fries were soggy though which was a little disappointing but the Waygu beef and the bone marrow were just making my mouth have an orgasm literally. Desserts do not disappoint either. We had the donuts with cinnamon sugar and Bakewell tart with Raspberry jam, both of which are just divine. Prices are reasonable in Singapore's standards. A meal can cost between $20 to $45 range depending on what you order. A bottle of wine costs $80 but compared to prices in restaurants in more expensive locales like CUT by Wolfgang Puck, it is a more affordable place yet still classy for night out with friends or with a date. A Good tip: The Study is one of those amazing restaurants where you can see the chefs cook in front of you if you sit at the bronze counter top. If you like to watch Cooking Reality TV shows, watching Chef Ano at The Study and his sous chef prepare and cook your meal in front of you is better than the TV shows. 2nd Tip: The Library, a fantastic hidden bar is located right next door to the Study and is part of the establishment so you can have drinks at The Library while having food served from The Study. A word of warning: The Mixed cocktail drinks are Potent to say the least. Note: I have just amazing respect for Nick the manager and Chef Ano. While I gave my honest opinion on the fries being soggy not expecting anything in return, Nick did not charge us for one of the dessert as a wonderful thoughtful gesture which I feel is a very high level of customer service that unfortunately is extremely rare in Singapore. I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone who wants to try the wonderful food dreamed up by Chef Ano and his team

The Study is the cool kid on the Keong Saik block. A hip space, with buzzing atmosphere, and just the right number of tables to be cozy yet happening. The menu is tasty classics tweaked up: cauliflower soup with delicious cheese toasties, the special pork belly didn't disappoint, and doughnuts with caramel whipped cream really hit the sweet spot.The best feature is the hidden door that slides open to connect the space with The Library bar later in the evening, allowing you to hog the dinner table all night and into cocktail hour.Come after work for dinner, and drink til close. (Residential area so doors shut before midnight)

Thumbs up for the dining ambience and the good service from the staff. We ordered trout tartare and wagyu onglet to share. Portion is great for 2 ladies. Trout tartare was great, love the springy texture! Wagyu onglet was alright but the bone marrow salad did not suit our taste buds. The drinks (donkey keong and probiotic) were quite a disappointment for the price paid. We were there on a Friday night and wanted to order more food at around 8 plus, but we were told that the kitchen wasn't able to cope due to some issues. Quite a dampening experience because of the kitchen issue.
