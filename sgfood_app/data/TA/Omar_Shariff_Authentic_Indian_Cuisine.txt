Really enjoyed the food. Service was sincere and friendly. Place although old is clean. Was nice that they had a 15% discount on new yearsâ€™ eve. Great for a family meal.

After endless takeaways always cold on arrival, not only was our food piping hot but absolutely delicious .. eventually after 8 yrs we have found a restaurant that delivers good hot food!
Excellent

The venue is OK and the service was good, but I'm afraid the food was disappointing, in particular the meat which was not of a high quality.

if your looking for north indian food fix...like your naans n kebabs n yummy gravies...i highly recommend this place as its tasty, served hot, very true to its flavours of the cuisine.. The portions are more than enough and the rogan josh is very good!!

I visited this restaurant while visiting Singapore and was impressed with the fact that the restaurant seems to draw groups of Indian diners and families. In my experience this is always a good indication of authenticity, cleanliness, and quality. Certainly, my lamb biriani was delicious, and there was tasty, cold beer to go along with it, so I was very pleased with my experience.

My family and I love Omar Shariff and often go there for special occasions. The service is great and fast. Staff do not hover unnecessarily but are always nearby in case you need them. Ambience is lovely and serene. We love their various chicken tikkas for appetizers. Food is fresh and full of flavor. The staff are happy to reduce or increase spice levels depending on your preference. Omar Shariff is also doing online delivery now which is great for days when we dont feel like leaving home

I came across Omar Shariff by chance. Was hungry one evening and saw this place on my way back home. Settled for a meal. Since then I have never been able to find a replacement. After having had over 20 meals at this place, I have set out to write this review.This is a place which serves authentic Indian cuisine in Singapore, at a very reasonable price. The promptness and courtesy in the service makes one feel special. The food, the gestures of the staff and the courtesy of Mr Karu (the owner) made me become a regular at this place. The cleanliness and the environment is awesome.I would recommend that those who yearn for a home like chappati, must visit this place for its soft and piping hot chappatis. The paneer preperations are also very good and savoury. Aloo Jeera and Yellow Daal must not be missed. The extensive menu can spoil one for choices. Highly recommended for party and get togethers
1
We were there with 2 adults and 4 kids for dinner. Relied on the good reviews we had seen online but the food was very disappointing. The murgh malai tikka was undercooked. The malai Kofta was made with potato and not paneer and the dal was at best ordinary.The carpets are worn out and the place has a dingy feel and the paneer tikka was the worst I have ever had
2
Normal indian food - naan a bit underdone, pappardam industrial, very thin on the sauces, good tandoori chicken, weak and dry lamb kebab, very mediocre butter chicken, good kulfi, okay lassi. Served, if one can call it that, by can't-be-bothered, lazy, unmotivated, and indeed downright rude Tamil boys in street clothes. Prices not bad, but this is two levels down from good hawker stalls. Very drafty old aircon; interior very bland, white-tiled 70s style building. No reason to go again
5
This is my usual takeout and dine in place. Everything I've had here is fab but the mixed grilled platter is my favourite. The service is always great and so quick. Highly recommend.
5
This is definitely one of my favourite places to go for Indian. I was there yesterday, after not having gone in a while and it reminded me of how delicious this place is. Really good and friendly service, nice place, wonderful food, 10/10.

This is my very 1st and good experience on authentic north indian cuisine! The restaurant is clean, neat, quiet, comfortable, and even romantic.The food was excellent with an varied menu.

Came on a Sunday for lunch. Was pretty quiet despite being 1pm. Took some time before we were given menus and to our surprise, were told that they had run out of papadums. When we asked if the chef could make some as our son loved them, we were made to feel that it would be a privilege if he agreed. Food was average, nothing very special, some dishes came out lukewarm. Would not return

My family and I come to this place very often and I thought I should write a review for them since we like it a lot. This is a place we come to when we want a good Indian food. There are many choices of Indian food around this area Holland V, Upper Bukit Timah, Serangoon, but we are most comfortable with this one. They serve mostly take out. But there are sitting room on the second floor. It is nicely set up, quiet, clean and bright. Our favorite dishes are fish tikka, chicken takka , tandoori chicken, dal makhani, lamb curry. The foods are tasty and delicious, well balance of spice and very appetising. It is best to go with rice or nan. The standard of the foods have been maintained over the years. We always enjoy a satisfying meal there. It is also reasonably priced.

I've never actually visited Omar Shariff--they always deliver to my apartment. But I've been a huge fan of their Palak Paneer for a couple of years. It's the best ever--creamy, spicy but not too spicy, lovely ginger garnish. It's really special. Their red wine is very good for the price, their daal dishes and naan are wonderful. I no longer eat meat, but their tandoori chicken was always tender and flavorsome. The lamb was also good. Their fish dishes are not my favorite (not bad, but not great), but everything else is wonderful. When they deliver food orders above a certain amount ($50?) they will give you a half tandoori chicken on the house. This is quite generous, but I wish they would ask if the customer eats meat before including a chicken dish with a delivery order. Anyway, the palak paneer is amazing

This is my first ever 'five star' review! This is the nicest meal I've had at an Indian restaurant. Marsala prawns, lamb rogan josh were wonderful (a little too spicy), but what we really enjoyed our night and I must give a big shoutout to Prescin (?), a great worker, very polite and smiling and nothing too much trouble!Good size portions, good value but it was soo nice to enjoy good food with a courteous host
3
Quiet ambience. Attentive staff. Soupy rasam was okay. Naan was so-so. Mushroom soup was okay. Mushroom mutter and dal was good. A must try.
4
This is our family's regular North Indian "go to" place and I brought my office colleagues there and they enjoyed the food very much.- good food at reasonable prices.
5
We had a lovely meal with biriani rice, fish kebab, sweet and sour prawns, and aloo gobi. All the food was tasty and hot but not over spied . The lassi drunk was nice and think too!
4
The food was pricey but delicious, especially the butter chicken! However, the table next to us had 16 pax squeezed into 12 seats n for some reason, did not want to move a few over to the empty tables so they kept spilling over to our side. The staff should have advised them to move some over to the empty tables. Instead, kept looking over to us to see if we were done, probably so that they could take over our table. Made us uncomfy and want to be done with our food fast.

We decided to move our next Curry Club to the suburbs, the food was really good and well priced, unfortunately the restaurant just lacked some atmosphere. However there curry's are very good with good portions and some wonderful tastes with a kingfisher beer you can t go wrong. Maybe go over the weekend for a good authentic atmosphere

I have tasted fish biriyani and chicken pakoras. The food seems to be more Malaysian cuisine rather Indian. The fish biryani is too much oily and pakoras are par cooked. The quality of food is not up to the mark, I could only eat 10% of what been served. It is no way close to Indian cuisine
5
Very neat, tasty and affordable food. I have been there many times and it never disappointed me. The best thing is authentic Birayni. The Nan bread is fresh & warm and you can choose any curry or side from the menu, all are yummy.A must visit for Indian food in Singapore
5
I went to omar shariff for dinner , it was a lovely experience & fabulous food . Tried Special biryani it was good & mango lassi was perfect , waiters were very friendly, nice value for money. they also have parking facility down . cheers team thanks for dinne

We have now used the takeaway service around six time and eaten at the restaurant once. Our experience has been good and the takeaway is especially good. There is always plenty of tasty food and they always throw in one or two free treats! I have eaten Indian food all over the world including India. In the main the dishes are prepared for what I'd call a "Western" pallet but this does not detract from the quality or the taste.We always have a selection of dishes but the Butter Chicken and the Mysore Lamb are our favourites! We always get some free tandoori chicken and this is delicious

Omar Shariff has been around almost 18 years and I being an adrent fan of North Indian cuisine, I always wanted to check out this restaurant and finally I had a chance to dine here last week. The manager dashed to the door and held it open after noticing that my wife is heavily pregnant. They were having their internal meeting downstairs with their staffs so we were ushered upstairs which was totally empty. Menu was promptly presented to us but the laminated sheets looked bit cheap and the typographical errors didn't save any grace. We ordered tomato soups, malai tikka and vegetarian samosas for starters. For the main course we ordered cheese kulcha and butter paneer. The tomato soup was not bad but the home made croutons were too oily suggesting that it was deep fried in oil right before it was garnished. The samosa tasted fresh but a tad bit of salt would have made the dish a lot more tastier. The malai tikka, chicken meat marinated in cream and subtly spiced was fresh and succulent. The cheese kulcha was ok. The butter paneer was outstanding. Rich tomato gravy and right amount of cream and butter. The paneer cubes were fresh too. We ended with a cup of sweet masala tea. Overall, it's a good restaurant that sells delicious North Indian diahes at a reasonable price.

Yummy indian food. The kali mirch mutton was too good. we ordered it 2 days back to back. Delivery time was a bit much though
3
Had dinner with friends after school in the area,and decided on Omar Shariff as we wanted to have Indian for dinner and it was too late to head to Little India.
Strengths: Attentive wait staff,good cleanliness and spiced well.
Weaknesses: Very high prices,small portions.
3
WE love indian food and eat all the time back home in NYC, this place is reasonable quality but expensive. The cutlery was dirty.
5
Reading all the reviews make me think I do not have any clue of good Indian food as I am a westener ;-) Frankly that was one of the best Indian food I ever had ! Amazing mutton topped it all ... Veggie kofta was great too and the butter chicken made my day... Too my opinion highly recommendable
3
We went to this restaurant hoping to find the perfect Indian place in our neighborhood. However, we were disappointed. The food was ho-hum, the service just okay, and the atmosphere was blah. Really have no desire to go back, though some of our friends have said that take out is great
4
Consistent and always good, this is another of our regular spots for it's reliable, good home cooked Indian food and location. King Fishers are always cold and you can count on some traditional Indian background music to add to the ambience. It feels like you could be transported to India when sitting inside with the traditional Indian art work and somewhat dated dÃƒÂ©cor. However, we always leave with a full belly and feeling satisfied
5
Good, authentic Indian food. I think the quality matches the price (one of my main criteria in rating restaurants), so no complaints! Go here for some reliable comfort food. Service is easy-going and friendly. The area is a nice change of pace too, from the overcrowded city area
4
Whilst you need to temper your expectations with somewhere like Omar Shariff, we all had a very good meal there and the service was excellent. The food was excellent with an varied menu, the beers were cold and there were a few wine options in line with a restaurant of this level. A good honest curry house if you fancy a meal out with friends, just don't expect anything too flashy

We went this evening for dinner with our family of 4 using the Groupon voucher and were impressed by the food and service. We ordered a whole tandoori chicken, chicken bryani, kashmiri naans, chicken madras as well as a chicken kebabs and they were good with the exception of the kebabs where my younger son did not particularly liked the taste but it was fine for us. I had a masala tea at the end of the dinner and it was also very good and hot.The service is not perfect but good for a restaurant of that size and price and the portions were in line with what other Northern Indian restaurants would be serving. If you know about Northern Indian food then you have to be patient like the tandoori chicken and kashmirian naans take time to prepare.The whole bill came to our S$ 102 which is very reasonable and we packed some small portions of the food back as we could not finish the tandoori chicken and the bryani.I would recommend this restaurant if you want good food with reasonable prices like around $ 25 to $ 30 a head depending on what you order.We will be back again in the near future

i visited the restaurant with my parents on 11 November 2012, using a Groupon voucher ($50 for $100 of food). the food was good (see the item by item review below). the staff were attentive and friendly. the restaurant allowed us to pack the excess food (a $100 voucher was a bit too much for 3 of us; i estimate that we could have had a decent meal for about $50-60). the only minus point was the out of the way location - it's in bukit timah. we will be happy to return nonetheless.we ordered the following dishes:(1) mutton tikkas - excellent (rating 8/10);(2) salad - i wouldn't order this again; there's nothing wrong with the dish, but it's just slice of onions, tomatoes, cucumber, green chilies & lime, as the name suggests;(3) daal mahkani - decent (rating 6/10)(4) palak paneer - decent (rating 6/10)(5) prawn vindaloo - good (rating 7.5/10)(6) khumber chicken baluchi - good (rating 7.5/10)(7) saffron basmati rice with peas - excellent (rating 8/10

Slightly expensive, but served a great variety of authentic dishes. Nice, friendly environment and the food taste great. Will definitely go there again.

Enjoyed the kasmiri naan, okra and leg of lamb and eggplant

Disappointing

I had chicken tikka masala and my wife had fish tikkas. I ordered the items to go and the packaging held up over the ten minute walk home. The food smelled nice and fresh and was still hot.Unfortunately, I neglected to order rice with my dish as I had assumed (perhaps foolishly) that it came with rice. When I ordered the food, it would have been nice if the employee had asked if I wanted some rice as well, but it wasn't a big deal. I cooked some rice once I got home.I thought the fish tikkas tasted pretty good, but I'm not sure what kind of fish they used. Whatever it was, it had a strong fishy taste that made the dish unpopular with my wife. The chicken tikka masala had a somewhat neutral and bland flavor. If it contained a wide variety of spices, it was difficult to tell. I also ordered some garlic naan, but I can't accurately rate it. By the time I cooked my rice, it had gotten cold and overly spongy. If you're dying for north Indian cuisine, this place will hit the spot. We won't be going back though

As a Singaporean, I am so afraid visitors will think this is the best this food paradise can offer. This restaurant is way over-priced, and the dishes are of very small portions and they are not generous with ingredients. At $5 a cup, the masala tea (signature drink of north indian cuisine) is too small and lacking in flavour. The wait staff were relectant and manager equally rude. Try Chat Masala, 158 Upper East Coast Road, Singapore. It is very good and has far better ratings in various blogs

This is my very 1st and good experience on authentic north indian cuisine! The restaurant is clean, neat, quiet, comfortable, and even romantic~:p I received very good service there! Of course, the food is satisfying and up to standard! There are vast of choices in their menu and make me wanted to try each of them~ :D As for the pricing, it is lower than what I expected. I am sure you will afford it and worth it for the sincerity and effort from the restaurant. I like the rice.:p The rice are longer in shape if compared to our local one and simply so soft and like melted in mouth :PThe nearest MRT to this restaurant is holland village. Can be reached by taking bus 970 at bus stop 2 and 3
