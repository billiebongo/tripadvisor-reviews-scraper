Street food house plastic chairs seems friendly. Cheap meals the only thing I don't like is the hygiene standards. Worth a visit.

Was caught by surprise how delicious duck rice was! Price was reasonable and the portion was quite generous as well. Will definitely head back again when I am in Singapore.

The braised duck is really good, tasty and won't be too salty, it can be serve with porridge, noodle, rice and kueh.
They have have unique homemade chili too, it's very different with any other duck rice store in the island.

Came for the duck rice. The steamed brown rice and duck braised with chinese housin sauce. U can add side dishes of pork, eggs, beancurd derivatives. Price was a bit on the high side as the quantity was small. The taste was on the salty side. Have to admit the duck was tender and braised to perfection

Was sitting atop a double-decker bus when it stopper for red lite at one interesting alley....didn't think twice of alighting as soon as it stopped at the next bus stop. Initially meant to address my caffeine craving...I ended up helping myself to a good fix of duck noodle!! Little did I know that this shop is actually voted as Singapore's No.1 Braised Duck Rice!! Indeed, its living up to its name! Apparently, Yu Kee Duck Rice is one of the biggest braised duck chain in Singapore with more than 15 outlets! With such a huge chain, it definitely tells us that their duck is a must try!! My rating?? Their chilli that goes with the noodle is super!! The herbal soup is awesome!!Their dishes are economical too! A bowl of duck noodle costs only $5!!Yu Kee...You Rock!

Had dinner here after watching a movie nearby. They recommended the set for two for $18.It came with two plates of rice, too few duck slices, a few slices of stewed pork, roast pork with hard and non-crispy skin, an egg, tau pok, some intestines and some braised peanuts. The food was okay, but the sauce was too salty. The chilli was great though, and went well with the food

I had the duck with rice, which also comes with the marinated egg and some other sides that I don't quite remember what. I like the egg, and the rice is flavoured. I think because the rice is flavoured, it makes the duck tasted blend. The portion and price is great. If you want to have a local experience, it is worth a try

Yu Kee Duck Rice restaurant's traditional Singapore breakfast is great. You can enjoy it in a relaxing environment.
5
I have not had anything here besides the traditional breakfast. The toast has sugary butter on it, the eggs are runny and the coffee is good. You sit outside and people watch. Bring your own napkins.

Hard to imagine a place with a name like this having such yummy food. I didn't realise the name until after we had eaten. Definitely popular with the locals this is a what you see is what you get Asian style eating house. The food is low cost very tasty with good size portions.

Randomize for breakfast we choose yu kee braised duck. Looking their menu picture was preety good and we order the duck braised duck rice. Wow the reality food we orderd was smashing down our expectation. Over all for yu kee is good, we love the thin duck slice, it's tender and juicy. The duck sauce was blunt, better to improve the sauce spices

One of the go-to places for braised duck rice in Singapore. The place at Bugis, near the Library, is especially popular on weekdays.You can choose between steamed or yam rice. The slices of duck are full of flavour too. There's a set meal option that also includes beancurd and a braised egg.Yu Kee has outlets at hawker centres and food courts around the island, though quality tends to vary

I used to frequent the stall at yew tee point.the duck noodles is springy and flavourful enough..especially the special chilli home made is marvelous.however the duck rice standard dropped drastically..used to be moist and soft.now it is hard and dry and after eating few spoons i decided to give up.the braised duck is good but too few slices.maybe due to inflation.i sincerely hope they regain the old standard

I have a confession to make, I'm one of those people that will eat peanut butter and chocolate sauce straight from the jar with a spoon. And if the chef has made a really good sauce for a dish, I'll mop up every last drop on the plate with a piece of bread. So when I tell you these guys have great sauces, I'm not kidding! I ordered the duck rice set (sliced duck, rice, 1/2 hard boiled egg,achar & a few boiled peanuts) which comes with slathered with Yu Kee's own secret brown sauce. While every stall has their own "secret" sauce this one is worth driving across town for because in addition to the normal dark soy and five spice aromas and flavors I'm pretty sure they add some non standard ingredients, like black coffee. But wait, there's more for serious sauce lovers! At the self serve counter, you have to try their sambal tumis ( a thick chili, dried mini-prawn, & no idea what else accompaniment). This stuff is so good that I go back for seconds and eat it with just the rice! In addition to the duck dishes they also serve kway chap set meals. The first time I ate kway chap I thought it was calamari (albeit calamari that had been soaking in dirt). My friends laughed and then told me it was thinly sliced, pig intestine. In remembrance of that day I call it "land calamari!" But hey, with enough great tasting sauce I can eat anything!! land calamari counter

There's many really good duck dishes served in the finer restaurants in Singapore like jiangnan court of four season hotel but to say the best duck rice in Singapore coffedsgko setting. It's yu kee. I've eaten this franchise duck rice since I was 12 years old. It first started in yishun, a neighbourhood place in northern Singapore. the recipe was passed down from the father to the sons to their apprentice. The braised duck has a unique herbal taste which have hint of soy sauce, aniseed, cumin, coffee. Their sambal chili is sweet yet spicy with a kick. Best complement to their soy sauce rice. They serve salted vegetable, tofu and braised egg with every duck rice ordered and ttbey also gave duck noodle, mee suan and kueh chap. A thick pieces of noodles in a soy sauce based soup eaten with pig skin, intestine, fermented tofu. A delicacies not many may agree but definitely hot with the locals. It's cheap too especially since bugis area being touristic can be quite expensive. Tip to get yt? money worth of meat us to order a quarter of a duck and ask them not to cut it. It cost about $5.50 for a quarter but a plate of duck rice with few flattened pieces of meat already cost about $4. It's worth a try especially if you are here for visiting and want try authentic siingappre duck rice. Forget the fancy Peking duck. It's Singapore flavour
