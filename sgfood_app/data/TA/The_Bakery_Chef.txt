Our friends brought my wife and I to this dessert haven. Good lord, the dessert we had was to die for. Urgh! Would definitely return for the Nutella and Salted egg yolk lava toast.

As the title goes... We really loved the salted egg toast. We ordered the charcoal toast with salted egg filling and matcha ice cream. Everything was gooooooood. Loved it!

Was brought here by a friend who heard of the Lava Toast and it did not disappoint. A signature dessert indeed.

Just dined in this little cafe in Bukit Merah. Tried the waffles with ice-cream, ham croissant, carrot cake and latte. The latte was average. The croissant wasn't good. The waffles were so-so (it came a bit burnt so was a little bitter). Ice-cream was not bad. But the carrot cake, the carrot cake was simply amazing. The cake was moist, had a generous dose of walnuts and was fantastic! Probably the best carrot cake I've eaten. If it was a little less sweet, it would have been perfect. It's $9.80 per slice but it's a big slice. Well worth the money for the quality. Note that the cafe is small if you're a big group. It has very limited seating (approx 20 pax).Will visit again, but will skip the other food and just go for their cakes

Whenever we need cakes for birthdays or any other occasions, we get it from Bakery Chef. Our favourite is the calamansi surprise. Their rainbow cakes are popular. It's made on the day you order so the sponge is very soft and fresh tasting. It is a small cafe in a bukit merah neighbourhood.

This was my second time visiting this cafe. First time was good, even if I didn't have the chance to get their soft serve ice cream with cotton candy.Purposely came here to try their matcha lava toast. My friends kept bragging about how nice their lava toast, so I tried.Cafe's interior and exterior design were the same. A small cafe but with outstanding lovely staffs; and variety of food, dessert and drinks in the menu.I ordered their Matcha lava toast as I love matcha. I chose the charcoal toast with matcha filling and matcha ice cream.***It was phenomenal! I love how it! It never disappoints me. Kudos to all staffs too. Thank you for the good service***Can't wait to be back and try your salted egg yolk lava toast!

Heard about this place and came by today to try out. Pretty small cafe with limited seat area. We ordered their signature lava toast $12.80 (charcoal bread with salted egg yolk matcha w/matcha ice cream), rainbow slice $5.80. Hmm, the rainbow slice is a disappointment (imo), too sweet and no taste onto each color layer but the sponge is not bad. As for the lava toast, bread is too hard to slice, the filling (salted egg yolk matcha) too sweet, too milky. It doesn't have a tingy bit taste of salted egg yolk.

As we thought and searched for café that is not so common. I saw this café being recommended online. My friend and I went there when they just opened on a Sunday morning (Hell yeah! We are actually excited with the lava toast), apparently what we wanted to order is only served at 12nn bec they need to prepare (This is understandable as they open at 10am) and bake to order.We looked at the menu and guess what?! Would you believe that my coffee+cake+macaron only costs S$10??? YES, IT IS! So, rather than being disappointed bec we didn't get to try the Lava toast, we are happy!We ordered, Chocolate Gravaja + Red Velvet cake + 2 Pistacchio macaron, it was mouth watering!Who would have thought that the nearby café in my place will have such a nice pastries and coffeeé blends. I've been noticing it before but good thing I finally getiing to try it!I will definitely comeback often here

Purposely came to The Bakery Chef cafe as many of my friends keep posting photos of their soft served ice cream in Instagram. I was curious about it and did visit the cafe.The cafe was quite during my visit as it was a Sunday morning. The cafe was small. They maximize the space effectively. From the counter you could see the chef preparing the orders of their customers.I wanted to have the bandung and lychee flavors with cotton candy but they do not have the flavors on that day. They also said that they do not serve the cotton candy anymore. The only available flavors were Earl Grey and Sea Salt.Earl Grey and Sea Salt soft served ice cream (S$4.50): It was nice. The sea salt and earl grey combination was delightfully tasty. I love the sweetness of the combination of the flavors. Definitely a must try!
