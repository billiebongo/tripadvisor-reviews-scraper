First try and love it! Waited 30 mins during dinner peak hour. This small pot for 2 at $12 is overloaded with ingredients. Super yummy. This small is actually good for 3 or even 4 small eaters.

been having this claypot rice since 10 years ago. I love the traditional ingredients such as salted fish, liver sausages and the chili sauce is great with the chicken. don't forget to order a portion of watercress soup too.
