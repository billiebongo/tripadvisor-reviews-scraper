Good choice of foods for everyone!
Especially everyone just pick what they love and shared!
Good ambience, good food, good selection!

Having lived in Switzerland I was expecting this Movenpick like the ones back in Switzerland. Interestingly they have the same quality but a much better range of options as well as a livelier atmosphere.
Recommended!

Love this place. This is the best Movenpick in Singapore (and I’ve been to them all). Salmon Chowder soup, garlic bread, lamb rack, snail sausage, coarse pork sausage, strawberry cake...all for $31 !! Take a look at the pic of the deserts and tell me you’re not tempted!

This particular Marche is still stable in quality. However, my current impression is that it provides very primitive tastes for such high price. Really, if you are getting Caesar salad with salmon for 20 dollars, you have the right to expect something beyond average. But... it is very very usual and average.
5
I really enjoyed this restaurant!It's a nice ambience with a lot of stations where you can find many kinds of food (like the soup station, crepe station, salad station, pasta station...). So you can choose what you want and bring it to your table with you. A great place to meet friends for a pleasant lunch or dinner

This is our second time to Marche having come here a few years ago with friends so we wanted to try it since we were back in Singapore. Marche did not disappoint. We received a friendly welcome and instructions on how to dine at Marche by the front staff. All the food was of the highest quality. No doubt the prices are slightly on the high side, it was worth it as we were getting freshly prepared meals with good customer service. We enjoyed the crepes and waffles. Yum, yum, yum. Looks like it's popular with families and large groups. Will definitely be back to this Marche at Vivo City the next time we are back in Singapore

Marche at Vivocity is a multipurpose multi-sensory culinary experience for us; the setting is great (aim for a window-side tables) with perfect lighting, take in the welcome sounds of people talking/laughing at their tables, and you are right next to your food. You see your food being prepared/cooked/served and ...you have plenty of choices. And above all...the staff, the ever-smiling and courteous staff. We, my teenaged son and I, have spent hours here, we have entertained many of our friends here and they all have loved it. And for us as a family, its a wonderful place to relax and have great conversations over good food.We make it a point to reach Marche by 5ish and are there until 9 or 10 pm. If you manage a table by the window, you catch the evening sky and of course the constant stream of visitors - tourists, shoppers, families, To eat and drink, there is plenty to choose from (a little less for vegetarians), but still, the salads, crepes, pizza, pasta (I had it once and is avoidable), the rosti is heavenly, the veggies good, and then comes the desserts. You have a very wide choice to choose from - pies, pastries, ice creams etc etc. Their lemonades, fresh juices and smoothies, teas and definitely the beer....all wonderful. The pricing is a bit on the higher side when compared to their portion sizes; the 'small' is piddly, medium is small and large is okay. But then you aren't just paying for the food here....you are paying for the whole experience

Place: very comfortable and clean. The AC temp is just right. Staff: friendly and accommodating.Food: Awesome!!! Pizza, crepes, pasta, seafood, rosti, steaks and fabulous deserts.Price: i find the steak and other food reasonable but I dont find the drinks to be at reasonable price. 2 drinks is equivalent to a price of a steak. LolOverall I enjoyed my dining experience
4
Found this to be most unusual way of ordering food as you are given a card about the size of a credit card and you then visit various food station and order and the whole lot is charged centrally.Overall the quality of the food is very good and the system works very well
3
It was a first for me. I thought it was a buffet spread when I came in but the concept was to go to your preferred stations to get your choices and they tap the rfid for every selection that you make.I just had rosti as everyone was raving about it. I chose mushroom ragù to go with it. My friends had pasta, rosti, salad and paella.The rosti serving was quite huge so i had someone to partake it with. I had a few bites of each selection that we they had.Rosti fell below of my expectations. It was close to being called a breakfast frittata.Perhaps the other stations serve good food but i just stuck with settling for the rosti.An hour into the dinner, my tummy was contracting. Imminent of a loose bowel movement which was brought about by the sour cream placed atop the rosti.That was how everything went downhill from there. Not to mention I was gonna catch a red eye flight a few hours after that dinner!My verdict, perhaps it is worth coming back to despite the agonizing lbm i had
5
Courteous staff. Wide range of food options. Fresh and well prepared dishes. Great location. Suitable for vegetarians too.
5
we really enjoyed and love this place wonderful wonderful experience we have memorable for us as well
5
Everything is too good to look forward at... highly recommended
Enjoyed n for sure to go again ....
Swiss concept of move n pick hotels
3
Pizzas, pastas,a quick bite maybe a beer. Average food but okay for a fast lunch if out shopping at Vivo- Pizzas are quite good
4
We had been to this restaurant earlier a couple of years ago and had enjoyed the experience.We went for dinner at this restaurant again last month. This time too we had a wonderful evening. The total spread and variety of food was excellent, Even the vegetarian dishes on offer were very good.The continental dishes were all superb.Highly recommended

We were here to celebrate my son's birthday. The table we were assigned to was by the glass panel and we were perspiring profusely while we ate. I spoke to the waitress and all she could say was that there were previous complaints. Proposed that they should at least put out stand fans for the table affected or close this section of the restaurant. My proposal was met with indifference, much to my dismay. If I had wanted to dine alfresco, I would have gone to a hawker center. My advise to those wanting to have lunch here, flatly refused a table by the glass facade. Why would an establishment be in the f&b business if they do not even care about the comfort of its diners? And let's not even begin to talk about the quality of the food. To Marche, please do not bother about giving standard reply to my review. I write reviews on here for the benefit of others. If you guys are sincere, then let actions speak louder than words. One of my worst dining experiences yet. Not coming back ever
5
My wife and I like to go to 313@marche at orchard there. for this time we try this branch since we went to Sentosa and on the way home. Food is always great. we ordered German platters and of course Rosti. Service was impressed me, fast and one of auntie very helpful even though it was a busy day on international day. definitely return next time
5
We went to outlet in Vivo city with family. The place is very nice with some nice views. Lot of varieties to choose from at different stalls within. I luv the rosti and sausages. Overall the place is great to have a fun filled dinner with family. We tried multiple items and all were good and worth cost.
4
As a family our preferred eating spot is usually Marches. We primarily used to eat at Marches in Somerset and Suntec. We were at Vivo city on Saturday evening and decided to try it out.While our experience with marches in Suntec and Somerset has been very good. Here the quality of the meats and crepes were quite terrible. I had ordered a roast chicken and it was cold and not served hot. My daughters chicken breast had an overload of salt, all four of us tasted it and confirmed that; we left that plate half finished. We also ordered crepe, and it outer layers we burnt.We came to Marches for the Swiss standard of efficiency and good dining; however what we saw in Vivo City were bumbling kitchen staff who were not adequately trained.Hope they improve, it is an outstanding Chain, and should not be ruined by such issue
2
We were there to celebrate a birthday . However , the front desk staff were not very pleasant. Halfway through the dinner my friend had to go to the toilet. When returning they stopped him from coming back in. We were just sitting next to the counter and we don't understand why she had to be so unpleasant
4
I have been to Marche many times. I like the cozy environment and fresh food display. Nice food too and value for money. Rosti is probably the signature dish.
5
Dependable Marche serves swiss german food for years in Singapore but it was only recently that I found out that they have lunch specials that is under S$10.
4
The food is preapred on the spot and that makes all the difference-fresh and nicely presented. A good range of food, with fresh juices and a tempting range of desserts make the restaurant a great place to eat out.
4
Original display cooking, food counter presentations & quality, fresh products. Efficient & organized ordering cum self service system.
Delicious Rotisserie, Rosti, Seafood Paella, Dunkel & Movenpick ice cream!
3
Good variety of food options.The pork knuckle was very good. Though the gravy a little too sweet for my husbands liking. The potato rosti was good too.I ordered a selection of vegetables. Very small plate which was supposed to be large size. Was quite expensive for $12. Very grumpy lady managing this station,Not friendly at all.The pizza was average.Good play area for the kids.The concept of charging everything to a card and paying on leaving was interesting.Very much a mediocre experience for me. Having to order my food at the various food stations was too frustrating.i felt like i was ordering in a cafeteria..but the prices were way too high for what i ate
1
We were just there to celebrate my Niece birthday! While queueing, a waitress came asking & trying to "promote" seating area near the play area. She said if we don't mind the noises at play area, she can give us a round table that can accommodate all of us (6 pax), didn't know what to expect, so we agreed to dine near the play area. She led us in, but no round table is there, and she had to combine 3 tables in such a cramp area instead! So we ended up dining facing the wall/glass, sitting uncomfortably & borne the noises from the kids roaming around the play area! While I understand all F&B players are trying to maximise the space usage, but please do not sacrifice the diners' dining comfort! We don't pay any less than other diners, and we are not there for casual dining but to celebrate a special event! The food there is so average, as such I don't find any good reason to patronise Mâché in the future!

I really want to like Marche, and the concept is wonderful. But there is just something that's making me not love it. Great selection of food, but there's just something missing taste wise in the dishes I've tried. Maybe just an off day? I've tried over the past few years and always enjoyed, but something has possibly changed this year and unfortunately. My friends had a good time and enjoyed their selections of the grilled chicken, calamari and rosti.
4
Great Swiss fare on a relaxed setting. The interior is decorated as a rustic Swiss chalet style, complete with cable cars, ski cabins and farm house. Food is on the pricier side but there is a good variety of European and local dishes, desserts and drinks. Staff is friendly and welcoming. Marche at Vivocity remains one of our favourite restaurant in Singapore
4
Our family went here to celebrate Mother's Day and enjoyed the whole experience. Good selection of different cuisines, drinks and desserts. Kids enjoyed the pastas and rosti with sausages followed by crepes and ice cream.Service was prompt and courteous...we also had nice chat with Kali who was a manager there.I would recommend a visit especially with family and we will surely be back soon
4
A very busy place but the line does move fast. Once inside many stations to choose from, so if group has diverse tastes, it's perfect to satisfy everyone. It's called Marche and has the loud marketplace feel. Had the seafood platter and it was well done with calamari, shrimps, two types of fish and salad. The salad dressing was delicious. Only choice of wine is limited and the Robert Mondavi at 68 seems overpriced but this is singapore. Will go back
4
We had gone to the vivo city outlet. It's great for kids as they have a small play area.
Superb roseti , crepes & waffles. They also seemed to have great pizza, salads, pasta.
It can be packed so plan in advance.
5
A good place for couples and family to eat in , order with the card at the stall inside selling drink ,dessert , salad, spaghetti and many more .good food and good service .
5
Great food! we had such a nice roti dish here! plenty of options and quick serve. We lucky didn't have to wait too long to get a table. Everything was great! highly recommend!
5
So many food choices . Pizza, salads, sausages and meats, ice cream, deserts the list just goes on. Best place to eat in Singapore
3
Nothing spectacular to merit the long queues. Expensive food. Overrated roasted food. Snobby cooks specially the one in the rotisserie section. Lady in the German Beer counter is so nice though.
4
Still good after all these years by prices have went up a few bit over the years. Go for the crepes it filling and nice. Not worth the money to add more ingredients. If you are going with your friends just order 2 different types and share. Deco is really beautiful. Just don't get a table near the kids playing area.
5
This is good value for money, if you do crave more western food then this has it. For dinner, I had mushroom soup, steak, potatoes and vegetables and felt very full afterwardsFor Breakfast, I had Eggs Benedict plus juice and coffee.The staff are very helpful and happy to help and direct yo
1
Ordered the roast chicken whole for delivery. Received it warm which was nice. But that was the end any good experience. The chicken was 70% bones and 30 meat. Terrible. Such a ripoff. I never knew such a chicken existed. Marche chicken cannot compare to the one you can buy from cold storage or Nandos. A stupid me, decided to order delivery of roast chicken again. Hoping previous one was isolated. And guess what. A really lean meat chicken with mostly bones. Ridiculous. I brought this to Marche attention international and local branch but no response. Their arrogance and skinny chicken, puts me off completely from their overpriced self service foods.
2
The first impression of this place is - the theme is catchy and the concept is interesting - like a marketplace for food; the variety and spread is good - rosti, paella, crepes, rotisserie, soups and salads.. in a nutshell, a neat place for Swiss/European cuisine. But it doesn't take long for those notions to get shattered. No one cares about your seating, your food, your orders and pretty much everything else (except the bill) anyway. If you manage to hunt and wait and beg for food and manage to get it (my little daughter got hers after 40 minutes and the order was a single grilled sausage!), the crepes are awesome, the rosti, damn good, the knuckles are pretty good. But hey, what's the big deal? So are dozens of other outlets in Singapore offering buffets, with much better taste, better value for money and the staff having much lesser (or no) snobbish attitude!If you like dining out, you'll probably try this once for the theme and will soon realise yourself that it's not worth the hype anyway. If this is purported European dining (it's not - trust me!), I'm better off trying something else at a lunch buffet at one of the premium hotels - the price I'll be paying there is pretty much the same, but with much better service and food
4
Nice restaurant, distinctly situated on the roof top of vivo city providing ample seating place. For us we really like Rosti and freshly prepared pizza. Nice healthy salad options customized as per your requirement. The look and feel of the place is intriguing with lots of options to choose from. There is a small play area for the kids to keep busy. Overall the staff is good and welcoming
4
Just arrived from Batam by ferry arriving Singapore lunch time. The choices are healthy but limited selected. Thanks to the receptionist. She has been very welcome even the restaurant is full.
4
This is our second visit to this establishment. We chanced upon this restaurant the first time, tried it and simply quite loved it. The restaurant employs a marketplace concept, where there are stalls within the central isle of the restaurant serving mainly Italian and European cuisine. You are issued a card that is used to record all the purchases that you made as you walk around trying to decide what you want to eat. There are confectioneries, salads and soup, pizza and pasta, grill section, paella etc. The station with the longest queue is usually the Swiss Rösti, it may look like an unassuming simple dish, but pair it with a sausage and you have a tasty and satisfying dish.The restaurant’s interior décor makes it look a bit like a market, with a touch of European style to it. It can get quite crowded at times, and the tables and spaced rather intimately, so you do get an environment of being in a market. The food is quite good, the environment is lively, price is errr… medium by Singaporean standards, and you ought to give it a try when you are in Vivocity
2
Staff was friendly at the front counter but due to public holiday food ( roast chicken and red onion pizza) was a 25 min wait.Tables and environment was clean as usual like other branches in singapire. Quality of food:Pizza (roast chicken and red onion)Don't know if I'm lucky or what but most piece of chicken on the pizza was on one side and also extra fattie.Chicken cubes tasted like off cuts. Bit disdapointed. I how the management can follow up because other foods departments looks very nice
3
Went today on Christmas Day around 4pm and it was still full house may he Coz it was raining heavily outside. Food was hot and miss, while Wife's Veggie plate was tasty and healthy but rest were just below average. Rosti was definitely over-rated. Chicken pasta was average and half Roast chicken with mushroom just fine. Apple pie was absolute disaster, you will stop eating it after eating here. Also, brownie chocolate cake was ok, nothing great. Prices are high but you pau for location and it's fine.Staff looked irritating and overworked especially at the counter where we ordered roasted kampong chicken. Absolutely passive.Not worth overall, there are many places in VivoCity
3
for most part I like the roman salad, sausage bbq, pizza, but for me the taste it self are not really that good, probably becoz this is a Swiss restaurant, therefore they cook it the way it is. so I must add seasoning (salt and pepper or even chilly) to make it nicer. price are also a bit expensive, but located in VIVO city, outside you can see Sentosa and Boats
4
Compared to the previous time I visited this place (a month ago), we had a much more pleasant time. Probably due to the fact that we went to Marche at around 4pm when it was almost empty. We also had a better idea of what not to order.For the crepe, this time we ordered the one without all the mushrooms, much better!! The sauce that came with the crepe was REALLY yummy and creamy!The beef was just nice and the soup is really rich. For dessert, we decided to get the mousse and this rich chocolate cake. From our previous visit, the brownie we ordered was really dry, so we went with a more "foolproof" choice. Also, if you get a cup of tea and any cake as a set, it is cheaper than buying them separate
2
Was recommended strongly by few friends of mine. Now I think maybe they were pulling a fast one on me.Food was sad and bland. Lacked any flavour. Was just flat. We ate the rosti which was just potato. No salt or anything. Mushroom soup sort of thing with that was decent. We tried going for a pizza but were told that the pizza doesn't have any sauce. It's just crust, cheese and toppings. Huh.The crepes were the only saving grace of the restaurant.The place was well made. Very Swiss. They give you a swipe card at the start and there are food counters everywhere. You have to order and get your card swiped. At the end you are billed as per what you ate.Wouldn't recommend unless you like bland unseasoned food

My wife and I patronized Marche @ Vivocity on Fri, 14 Oct at about 9pm.As usual, we ordered our all time fav Rosti with Chicken cheese sausage with egg. This is our must-order food whenever we dine at Marche.Unfortunately, the eggs were horribly cooked - 2 eggs were cooked in 1 pan and torn into 2 later. The egg yolks burst and the whole presentation was horrible. Please refer to the attached photos.The person who prepared the food was not even apologetic by the way the eggs were cooked and it's presentation. It was a turn-off for me.I hope to hear from you on how does the food especially the eggs and it's presentation look to you
3
The food is average and very pricey, especially since it is a self-service place. The restaurant is really cramped since the food stalls were so close to each other and the seating areas. The queues were really long too. Beef Bolognese: Nice but not worth it. I rather get the same thing from Holland Village's market for only $4.the Meat Crepe thing: too much mushrooms, really filling though. You might need to share it with someone else (especially if you are planning to try different foods there)chocolate cake: not rich enough, a bit dry too.The ice cream from Movenpick was the only thing I thoroughly enjoyed. If I decide to eat at Marche again, I will probably go to a different branch that is perhaps more spacious. (I used to go to a different branch when I was younger, with my family. This is the first time eating at their Vivo branch
5
This place is amazing!!! The service was excellent, the food was exceptional with flavor that bounced off my tongue. I felt content on the price I spent (less than 50 for a meal). All the food is made from scratch with fresh ingredients... what more could you want
4
Great ambience, swift service, smiling and courteous staff. Very good varieties of pastas, seafood rosti crepe roll, the mushroom soup was very delicious. Also, the drinks were freshly prepared.
I felt a bit pricey for the quality of food, nevertheless will visit once again.
5
different food station feature, juice, Swiss speciality, pasta, wine, seafood etc....with beautiful wooden decor
4
i went there with friends and kids.
it was hard to decide what to eat. many, many choices.
we decided to eat pizza, delicious paella, steak and some more dishes.
in evening time it's better to make a reservation call.
4
You can pick and choose their own taste and have great fun and Memorable night with your friends,family

Marche is a buffet style restaurant where you go up to different booths and have the cooks prepare the meals right in front of you before you take it back to your seat. They have a salad bar, pasta bar, pizza stand, stir-fry area, etc. Sounds like a good concept but it was poorly executed. The restaurant is pretty tight for space and was crazy busy when I was there. There was no crowd control what so ever so everyone was pushing against each other to see the food options. The lines themselves at the different booths were also very long... I had to wait almost 15 minutes just to get a salad. The prices were also too expensive (a pizza was around $20) and I didn't like the fact that you had to go up to the drinks booth and wait in line forever just to get some water. In summary: Skip this place. It was not a relaxing dinning experience
3
Being a fan of Marche at 313 Somerset, I went to this branch in the afternoon of Sunday, 11 September 2016, expecting the same experience. I came with my wife, infant son and two friends. my wife ordered the classic carving. It is some beef steak (rib eye steak, if I am not wrong) served with mashed potatoes and sauteed mushrooms. I opted to have, as usual, the pork knuckle with sauerkraut. As expected, the pork knuckle is crispy and delicious. The classic carving is also very good and the portion is pretty generous. For drink and dessert, we had pineapple lemonade, cafe latte and creme brulee. All are good, but the creme brulee came without some berries as decoration. As far as I can remember, I saw someone ordering creme brulee in Marche at 313 Somerset and it was served with some fruit decoration. Even though the food is delicious, the environment unfortunately fell short of my expectation. The place is quite cramped and, somehow, I feel that it is hot inside. Some staffs at this restaurant also looked pretty stressed and this affected the dining experience. In addition, it seemed to me that the interior arrangement was also not as good as the branch at 313 Somerset. Some raw materials were put at the corner and they were not beautifully arranged. I will come again for the good food, but not for the environment I suppose. As it is located at the rooftop of VivoCity, high room temperature is to be expected especially when it is sunny. I still prefer the Marche at 313 Somerset, but I will still consider coming to this branch, only for dinner, not lunch though
3
Have visited Marche numerous time, since I am stationed oversea and back Singapore for holiday, decided to satisfy my desire for rosti. When you went in, they will issue a card to you and you can use the card to order the food and beverages and thereafter go to the exit counter, hand over the card to make your payment. We went to the branch in VIvo city, have ordered rosti, half chicken and a carborana pasta. The rosti is superb as always, however the chicken tasted normal and especially the carborana is a big disappointment, it is overprice at $16.90 sgd, the portion is small and it is very saltish. My friends have ordered a pizza, which is a disappointment, hoped it will improve its food quality first. This experience really destroy my good impression with Marche, I will still be back to eat the rosti, but other foods I will give it a miss
4
If you want a good Crepe, Pizza or Salad- Drop by. Its healthy, European and lots of choices. If you have picky friends or yourself- come here the options are many and you will be able to satisfy everyone. Its pricy but OK for a once in a while.  They also have good drinks (fruit juices), beer. I went to the Vivo city outlet- It often is very crowded and you may have to eat with lots of people talking and walking amongst you
4
Marche (also know as Marche Marketplace in different countries) is a chain that has a very good selection of different types of foods. You pick how much you would like and have it prepared for you on the spot. Salads and produce are always fresh, as are the pasta, meat, potato and fish dishes that are prepared to order. And, least we forget the WONDERFUL desserts that are usually made in house. There is also a nice selection of German Beer, wines by the glass or bottle, soft drinks and water to quench your thirst. So, its a fun place to take the family or just yourself if you are looking for lunch or dinner and are unsure what you would like to eat!! Enjoy!!
4
I was here with 5 of my friends on 14th August 2016. The ambience was really good and the design of the place ties in really well with the variety of food offered here.Food was delicious. I ordered the Cream of Mushroom Soup and Salmon Fillet. Mushroom Soup was good and came with a big portion. Salmon Fillet was a little dry and the skin was soggy. Despite that, the flavour was quite good. My only issue is the price. It is slightly steep. But, it is good for a treat once in a while.Overall, I would return once in a while with my friends again
4
Very nice place, great selection for European food. From healthy salads to heart stopping food (literally...pork knuckles Delish). Must try just peeps.
5
Hard to find big salad dishes in Singapore. The Movenpick Marché has the best choice we found in the city.
3
It's an ok restaurant, good size servings, fresh fruit shakes made to order, different stations, additional fee to personalize, fast moving, busy.
5
Up to now, this has been the best valuerestaurant we dined in. Also , where many restaurants closeat 10 PM, this one was still open. Excellent Swiss quality food andbig ventilators constantly bring in a fresh breeze.
4
Second location we've tried in Singapore. Vast variety, fair amount of vegetarian options, fresh and made to order. Long wait on a Saturday evening but worth the wait.
5
I love Marche - no two ways about it. Its got everything under the sun. Right from sundaes to pizza. Dont miss out on the crepes - make sure you add the mushrooms
5
We had great fun wandering around this fresh market selecting what delicious morsels we would have for dinner. The decor was Swiss chalet from top to bottom including a gorgeous sleigh from the 1830s. Mostly European foods, all very fresh and hand cooked/made. They give you a swipe card which use hand to each stall when you select a dish. They cook while you wait or give you a buzzer to take back to your table. Either way it isn't long! We queued for about 5 minutes on a Friday night to get in, but it was so worth it! The food was delicious and generous serves
4
I have visited the branch in SunTec center in the morning. My eyes were chasing the pleasure of seeing fresh ingredients being displayed and used to prepare your order. It is a great place to go as a family to enjoy breakfast, lunch, or dinner. We have tried the mushroom flat bread and the breakfast special with two eggs and ham. It is a self service where you order, pay, and collect your tray. The staff were very friendly and were explaining their role and the way the serve food when they noticed us taking pictures. If you are staying near SunTec, I would skip the hotel breakfast and go to them
4
Pros - lots to select from. Pizza, crepe, Swiss roti, fruits, juices, desserts. Good food. Play area for kids, my 3 year old enjoyed a lot. Quick service. Cons - too crowded. Very hot inside as place is all cramped up with many kitchens. Have to wait long if many people ordering same things and no place to stand and wait. Overall good for experience.
4
Food at Marche is always good, amazing amount of thing to tempt your eyes before you decide what you want. We find there is something for everyone. The only reason it doesn't get five stars is that the coffee is terrible - it's way below where it should be. It tastes burnt and the milk is always over heated so you need to wait 10 minutes before the first sip
2
Been today to Marche at vivocity where they served margarita pizza without basil leaves...please avoid eating pizzas here...very disappointing
4
Mad busy place, you get a card when you enter and go around each counter for the food you want! Everything from steak to paella, all made to order. A wee bit pricey.
3
Visited the outlet in Suntec for lunch today. Rosti + a beef and mushroom goulash for around $12 or so. Pretty tasty and plenty of available seats. Reasonable option for a cheap lunch.
3
Was visiting the place after two years.Staff wasn't helpful. Despite having tables near the window, we were given a table at the back.More importantly - food was average. You can get better pasta and pizzas in delis around the place. Juices were excellent and a must to have
3
Marche was a heaven for European food lovers. The key is "was" as it is no longer.We frequented both Marche (303 and Vivocity) in the past years. We are very sad to see the service standard and food quality is on down-trend.Novelty is completely gone. The staffs are weary (give them some break, Management!). They can no longer smile. Worse still, they have difficult time not to yell at customers -- they are commendable as they have yet to yell but they are almost yelling. They are selling Kampong Chicken (Singapore food) and Coconut now. In a few months, we may even have Cocunut Rice (Malaysian food) and Chicken Masala (Indian food). The point is that it is no longer a European food heaven.In addition, sausages taste like they come straight from Giant (the supermarket from level 1 and basement of the same building). Overall, we are very sad to see the downtrend on one of our favoraite resturants. :'
4
I ate here as a couple for lunch, and they had a 3 course meal deal for about $30.It came with soup, a nice healthy grilled salmon, and then a plate of icecream or cake.The service was great, attentive and helpful with menu options. Food was tasty and it filled me up for the rest of the afternoon of shopping that had to be done!Easy access, right on Orchard street. Plenty of options for food, and a good healthy menu with smoothies or shakes a plenty
4
I visited Marche Movenpick at Vivocity earlier this week and had the lunch express with my colleagues. I had Baked Pasta with Pulled Beef and it was really very delicious. I will appreciate if the drink can be choose between soft drink or coffee as i prefer a hot drink. Overall, it was a good lunch experience
3
My family and i decided to have dinner on a Thursday evening as it has been a long time since i ate at Marche and it was my wife's 1st time. The queue time was around 30 minutes before we got a table. We were accorded a table right behind the entrance of the restaurant and it was so distracting and extremely warm for the price we are paying. It was located at the playground area for kids and our baby is only 1 year (she cannot play).We ordered Cream of Mushroom Soup, Kids Meal, Ribeye Steak and Spanish Paella with Pork Sausages. The Kids Meal do not really suits my baby as the spaghetti is too hard.The Baked Potato that i ordered along with the Ribeye Steak was too hard.The Cream of Mushroom was too watery and cold.The Spanish Paella was good but overpriced at $19.90.Overall, this visit back to Marche was a very bad experience...and given the fact that i patronized once every month, it was so disappointing..
3
Was there together with wife, my aunt and uncle. Its a nice place. Just a bit too noisy for my own liking. And the queue can be quite long for certain food. It really does make me feel that Im actually in an upmarket food court which is more expensive yet you need to queue longer before you can enjoy the food which is nothing to be shout about as well.
2
It has been almost 6 years since I have been back to Marche VivoCity. Back then, we were not so spoiled by the many patisserie, pizzeria and fresh pasta choices available. We have to queue almost an hour to get in. It was packed on a public holiday evening. At 8pm, food was running out ! The paella station was closed. The queue for the Rosti took another half an hour. The onions, sour cream and Lemon slices had run out. Prices remain the same though. The Rosti would have tasted better with these condiments. The staff were not very friendly. One has to call them a few times to get their attention as they were quite busy preparing the food behind the counter. I am not too impressed. I would rather go to Ambush to eat the same quality of Rosti, nicer variety and better tasting sausages without the queue and better service at about the same price
5
We used to go there very frequently. The food is good. The ambience is good. The restaurant is situated at a lovely place.
4
Nice place with a wide variety of European foods including the Rosti. Nice concept of seeing your food being cooked in front of you. To choose, not from a menu card, but based on the actual dishes is kind of nice. Good ambience.
3
This was the first time we had used this style of restaurant so was VERY disappointing not to have been asked if we had visited before and not to have had it explained to us. It is a self-service style place where you queue up at the different sections to order your meal & have anything you order added to a credit style card. Initial service was shocking - felt like we were just dumped at the table & when we discovered one of our cards was missing it felt like we were being interrogated for stealing one of their cards!! Once I figured out what you did (wouldn't recommend trying to ask the waiting staff anything as you just looked at as tho' you have spoken double-Dutch!) it wasn't that bad. Kids meal was classed as a "picky kids" which included a meal & drink but tbh I think it could have been a better choice - my eldest had a pizza which was hand & freshly made & was quite tasty, younger son had sausage with a huge rosti. I opted for a chicken ceaser salad which was tasty - but when I asked for cucumber you'd have thought I'd asked for the crown jewels & yes I didn't get any!! Hubby had oxtail soup which was filled with chunky veg & a slab of actual oxtail - he said it was OK but missing something.Word of warning - there are no toilets! You have to leave the restaurant (leaving something valuable behind so you come back), this is a common trait in Singapore so beware.Overall I thought it was OK but my husband hated it so I doubt very much we'll be back
4
Went to MarchÃ¨ for dinner, it was a little late, like 9pm, but the closing was at 11, later than many other places around. The place looks like a fresh market square, with many small shops serving every sort of food and drinks. We had grilled meat and the paella, everything was tasty and fresh. Prices are very convenient for Orchard road and for eating western food. At the end of the service we got offered a buy 1 get 1 free deal on desserts, so we got a fruit cake and a cheesecake. It was all good
5
This one is a specialty restaurant that offers fine Swiss Cuisine. There are different counters for salads, starters, main course, desserts and yes famous Rosti. You have to buy what you like and pay when you exit. It's a completely different concept and you can enjoy food thoroughly.Overall super experience
4
Very nice dining concept! Good ambiance.Freshly cooked food that you need to choose and pick first before preparation. Variety of food from Swiss, Italian, Mexican, Asian, American and German Regions.Fresh Juices , Salads, Tea Bar, Desserts.Everybody gets a "Card" at the entrance, to be used for Swiping at Food Counters at the time of Ordering your meals. Don't loose your card
3
The restaurant functions like antler or food court where you pay for it meal upon checkout at the cashier counters and not at the individual stalls.The place is messy and hard to navigate, there are countless stalls selling what looks like pre-prepared food. The food is not fantastic, my rosti was soggy and filled with butter and the German sausages tasted ordinary.Things can get pricy as you get trapped in the crowded food hall. I found myself scrambling about and over ordering in fear that the lines might get too long.
5
Marche at Vivocity is my all time favorite place. I love this place so much that I have been here a couple of times already.Concept / Service - Just great. You are given cards at the entrance. The entire place is built like a marketplace. Your card is swiped every time your order and you need to pay at the exit for the amount mentioned in your card.PS - Be careful not to loose the card. You need to pay 50 sgd fine if you do.Food - Totally recommend the Swiss Rosti. It is a potato dish served with fresh cream and you can add on chicken, beef etc. over it. Crepes are amazing. Try the banana chocolate crepe. Apple crumble pie is great too. Pasta and pizza are average. Fresh fruit juices are lovely. You can combine 2 juices.Price - It is a bit expensive. Beverages cost around 7sgd. Rosti is for around 8 sgd without the add on, with the add ons it is around 15 sgd. Chicken /seafood are between 15 - 25 sgd. Salad portions are little and at 10 sgd. A meal for 2 would cost around 50 sgd with drinks.Conclusion - I totally recommend this place for food lovers. Must visit for anyone who visits Singapore. Great ambiance and great food
5
Love love love the ambiance, food and service. From the entrance, you have to go down the stairs or thru the elevator. You get this Guest Card that tracks all your orders. Once you get a table, find something you like, order and give your card. There might be a line for their best sellers, like the Paella, but it's worth it. They usually make it fresh so yum! When youre all full, you'll surrender the Guest Card and pay for the meal. Enjoy
5
On the terrace of Vivo mall Marche offers one of the finest confectionary and European food.had pastries there . .The food and ambience is great.vivo mall is above the harbour front station and from the same level you get mono rail for sentosa island. avoid peak times as there is heavy rush.
5
Probably better than the Somerset branch for the ambience and the location.
Love their paella and sirloin steak.
4
IND: Berbagai pilihan makanan western
ENG: Variety choices of western food
IND: Tersedia juga beer.
ENG: There is also beer, Cheers ~
5
Loved the concept. Loved the ambience. Loved the food. Definitely a must try!
And this is where I had an initial taste of a Stracciatella ice cream. Rosti, too!
Be warned: food is a little bit pricey.
5
Love the food
Love the beer
Can't complain anything
Except for the long line but once ur in everything is fast
Would visit again
5
Been here plenty of times love the variety!!! Yummy fresh food! Only downfall is sometimes can be a wait if you go at a busy time due to the popularity
4
Lovely place to go with friends or family. If you come in during the peack lunch / dinner hours you will have to wait because there is almost always a queue. The Rosti has been my favorite and I have been here a couple of times, so I have tried all the varieties of Rostis starting with the original one and then adding on snail sausage and mushroom as well. I also love the desserts here. Crepes are amazing. Not so great for salads because of the portion size / quantity served. The chicken cheese sausage is also something I would personally recommend
2
The chicken cheese sausage and the marinated pork neck steak used to be my staple when I went to Marche but the quality has changed recently and now its not good. I hope they are able to change it back to what it was before as I enjoy the atmosphere here
3
Marche was talk of the town for a while, so we decided to try it. The concept of the restaurant is interesting. They'll give you a card, and when you order something, they'll credit it in your card and after you eat, you surrender your card and pay for your meal.There are different types of food you can choose from, we dine quite late at night and they have already closed the paella station which I was hoping to try, I opted for the potato rosti instead and paired it with sausages. The sausages were good but the rosti isn't to my liking. Their serving is also small, which is quite disappointing for you pay a lot of money for one dish.Maybe, I'll give it another chance, but this time. It didn't live up to the hype.
2
It was our first time eating at MarchÃ© and it was a good and a bad experience. Good in the sense that we love their ambiance and since it was not peak hours me and my husband was able to pick our choice of seating. The bad thing was when we started ordering our food it was presented poorly and the taste wasn't awesome as we expected. We had the highest expectations from them because they had been a recommended restaurant and take note we did came back the following day because Saturday evening was truly jump packed with diners and the waiting time was too long. But for us it was a failing grade for them that Sunday afternoon. The dishes weren't so great ( we had ordered there signature Caesar salad, sweet and savoury crepes, carbonara pasta and a fruit juice) which we paid for a whooping 80dollars which we think does not justify its taste and presentation. And based from this experience we definitely won't come back nor recommend this restaurant especially in their location in Vivo City
4
It has been years since I last patronised Marche, the last of which was at Hereen. The quality and selection of food have kept up to standard though the prices have gone up rather substantially. A family of 4 having Rosti, seafood platter, pizza and pasta cost close to a whopping $100. Hopefully the price can stay competitive to attract loyal customers.
4
Had lunch here on a weekend and it was busy with a waiting queue! The food is good and there is a large variety of things to choose from. They payment system is a no-hassle novel thing
3
Went to Suntec outlet for brunch. Drinks were pretty expensive. Portion of meal like pizza and crepe is big and food for sharing. There's a playground for kids but it gets very noisy due to the limited space.
5
Transports you to Switzerland while in Singapore. A wide variety of food to choose from - salads, seafood, pizzas, rostis etc .
4
Marche@Harbourfront has continued its tradition of serving good food in a casual food-court setting (very much like Medzs and Shokudo), where patrons can freely order what they fancy from the different food stalls and settle payment only before leaving the restaurant.My friend and I chanced upon this outlet yesterday; we were delighted to note that besides ala carte European dishes, there were three items offered under the daily "Express Lunch". Served with a glass of homemade (restaurant-made) soft drink; and no service charge!As the Swiss rosti queue was rather long, both of us instead had the braised lamb leg, served with ratatouille and mashed potatoes: all very scrumptious. The generous portions of lambs served to us were succulent and delicious. Nicely-priced too.The pizza and paella booths appeared to be popular with diners.The lunch-time crowd obviously were having a great time. Helpful staff were around should patrons require any assistance
4
This is one place that can never let me down. I make it a point to take my friends who come visiting, knowing well that this lovely restaurant will leave them impressed. I love the fresh juices, the Swiss Rosti and savoury crepes. They have a good breakfast spread from 10 am-12pm and an express lunch option on weekdays for office goers under $10 SGD.
5
Love it! Everything is fresh...I've got the chance to choose the way I like it. Its like your in a supermarket, choosing your produce and then they cook it! The ambience is exceptional, located in the basement, with circling stairs.. I am so amazed by it
4
Love the food here n the relaxed casual dining experience. My family enjoys the savoury as well as the sweet crepes here and Rosti is our must have. The pizzas freshly baked with quality ingredients are a real treat. Only thing we don't like is the long queue which can't be avoided on week ends as no reservations are allowed
5
I just love the set up. It gives the guests a variety of action stations to select the food from. My favourite is their salmon and mushroom crepes. I've been to Singapore two more times since Jul, and made sure I payed a visit to this place each time to try out my favourite meal.The food is a bit pricey compared to other similar restaurants but worth it
5
we had the lunch special. hungarian goulash g arlic bread plus home made lemonade for just $9.80sd (there was several other choices salad etc very happy would recommend decor is fabulous.please note this was the restuaurant in 313 orchard rd ( not near the harbour)wish we had a Mache in sydneyps excellent rest room facilities ps be carefull its easy to get court up with the numerous items on offer then run up a big bil
4
If you happen to be in Singapore and would like to try Swiss food in a countryside atmosphere then head to Marche Restaurant in Vivo City Mall. Great outing for the family where one can go to the different counters and get the Pizza or Rosti made by selecting the toppings & seasoning. Rosti is a dish made of potatoes and tastes awesome with a dip. The salad counter offers a wide choice. We enjoyed our dessert too 
3
This is a place which truly is for everyone. The dishes are detailed for you to pick your choice. Fresh preparations.
turn on: Vivo city, food for all, self service
turn off: Expensive, crowded
4
This place has lots of good options when it comes to European food, fresh great ingredients, and the price was right.
4
great format, can chose what you want and pay for it via the electronic card... best to avoid peak times as hard to get in and also to get served. Other than that, a different but better experience
3
Great idea because of the variety of European style food. Ordered a Rosti and it was freshly cooked but lacked flavour and had no seasoning. Very bland. My guest ordered Battered Squid Rings. They were dry and tough. We both had drinks and the total bill just short of S$50. Could have better spent the S$50 at a Hawker Stal
2
I had been to the other Marche at 313 an year ago. This time around I wanted to try out the other one. I was totally put off by the terrible attitude of the staff. I asked a supervisor if the pizza is thin and he gave me a lecture that they don't make, thin or think, that I'd to accept however it comes out. Honestly, as a paying customer I found this to be very rude, the way he spoke to me in front of many other customers. Unnecessary and poor attitude. At the end, the seafood pizza was inedible and soggy. I'll never ever recommend this place to anyone.
5
Marche is a great surprise. Excellent place for freshly cooked food done before us! Like in Switzerland, this place is self-service and you can comfortably walk around to pick your favorite choice and ask them to cook it for you. Excellent pasta, sausages, cooked as per your choice.! The guys allowed me taste some beer before I ordered a pint. I Great place indeed..I will be coming back soon 
5
Love Marche especially when you have kids . They have a fantastic play area for kids and they are very busy there . So we typically take the kids option which is 10.30 sgd plus taxes and after they eat their meal they are off to the play area . I have 2 boys 4 and 5.5 so hard to get a peaceful meal when they are at your table :) . Here we make them eat first and then go and grab a rosti , a pizza or a salad which is made fresh . The rates are slightly on the higher side but worth it .
5
On arrival each guest is given a card which they take with them to the various food stations. All the items are detailed and priced and you place your order at the station and the item is added onto the card. There is a good choice of food and should be something to please everyone in the group.You can go backwards and forwards as much as you want and when you have finished just go the checkout desk and your card is downloaded and you are presented with the bill.
4
There are some places where you just expect abundance of choices but mediocre food. But to my surprise, Marche's food was great overall. Especially worth a mention was the pizza and the rosti with mushroom ragout. Amid the bustling atmosphere, families enjoying their wide range of selection, from pizzas to paellas made fresh from scratch! Be prepared to wait a bit as some dishes takes time to prepare. A great meal, we all over ate, that's how good it was
3
We r 7 for lunch and its not a busy day. Food is good with minimum spread options.concept of the restaurant is better thn food. Need more guest service,atleast in the food counters. cant see anyone's face happy to serve us. From the juice counter to billing point. Jus come order your food, wait - once ready pick and move. Anyway gd experience with gd food in swiss market
4
Nice place ! You should go there with your friends ! The concept is perfect. The atmosphere make you feel that you are in Swiss!
5
We had a great time here amazing food and enviorment the pizza is amazing there .must visit resturant on your trip in singapore
5
This is an excellent innovative idea of a food hall offering several dishes ready to cook in a few minutes and eat in or take away. So, we had the sausage and rostie which my husband loved, I had the chicken and salad delicious! Another night we took away the pancakes, one with ham veggies and one with chicken salad, both large and very tasty. The decoration inside is very cosy warm lots of timber, heaps of character Swiss style. They have many tables and chairs for eat in, no alcohol served. The prices were reasonable and I definitely recommend this style of food hall. A great find in a busy shopping mall
5
The staff is friendly and helpful and the food is tasty and made fresh. The breads are also great and you must try the refreshing juices. Great family place and works with little kids also! Highly recommend it as the market like ambience is very different and a great thing to experience
5
A friend introduced me to marche on a recent trip to Singapore and I loved it. The pork knuckle looked really good and I'll have to try that next time I'm in town. To be honest, I wasn't sure what it was when I first saw it! Just looked like an enormous hunk of barbecued meat. I was having a hard time deciding what to get as I walked around all the various food prep areas. I saw some hash brown potatoes that you can get topped with various cheeses, sour cream, etc that looked incredible. But then I saw the savory crepes. I had one filled with ham, cheese, and sauerkraut. Heavenly! You can also customize it with additional toppings for an extra fee; I added mushrooms. It was huge and I was able to eat only a little more than half of it. Highly recommend
4
We went here on a Monday evening and there were still a lot of patrons but without the Long lines. The place felt like a weekend market with fresh produce cooked for you. At the entry area, you will be given a "credit card" that you will use to purchase food items within the restaurant. When you're done with your meal, upon exit, you will pass by a cashier and you'll pay whatever had been swiped on your card.The food was reasonably priced. We tried their best sellers: the rosti and the pork knuckle and the lamb. I loved the lamb the most, it was prepared well and was truly tasty. The rosti was great as well. Pork knuckle was good, I had better but that was in Germany. We also tried the root beer and the white beer. The root beer was awesome that we wanted to have some for take away. The beer was so-so. I hoped that they had more brands like Radler. Overall, it was a nice experience. It felt like a euro trip in my mouth. I don't want to be there on a weekend because for sure it's a riot. Highly recommend
4
Choose and Pick your Foods before preparation. Fresh Food Variety is procured from Swiss, Italian, Mexican, Asian, American and German Regions.Fresh Juices , Salads, Tea Bar, Desserts Counter all make this remarkable Concept very Unique and Different from other Dining options. Everybody gets a Credit Card at the entrance, to be used for Swiping at Food Counters at the time of Ordering your meals. Fresh Food Displayed is quite Interesting in itself.... like a Farmers Market !Worth Trying once 
3
When we lived in Singapore this was a place we went to once every two months or so. The food is of reasonably good quality and not to expensive. Menu is also average at best, but a large group having a quick dinner where everybody gets to order their own meal this might be perfect
4
If you have never been to Marche, you should give it a try. Each customer is given a charge card at the entrance (very much like a credit card) and you just proceed to various booths to order your food. I usually charge all my purchases to one card. Just make sure you keep your card safe as you will be fined if you lost your card. Food is fresh and display are all very interesting
4
Come with my family.The place in the top floor of Harbourfront Mall and just next to the tram exit from Sentosa Island.The place have warm and homey feeling.We ordered crispy pork knuckle and medium rare rib eye steak, great taste but have only one type of sauce.Stir fried vegetables could have a little bit of extra seasoning
5
We had dinner at marche's and the food and deserts are awesome. You get good vegeterian options like pasta, pizza, salads, crepes and waffles. Also the deserts were mouth watering and delicious. Overall the food is delicious and reasonable price like any fine dining restaurant.
5
The place has an excellent vibe. The interior decor is unique and eye-catching. The food is beyond good. A must try for food lovers.
5
It was a unique experience. It was literally like a former's market in a restaurant setting!
All the produce used is 100% organic and the kids have a lovely time going around selecting the food and beverages!
4
We really enjoy our meal in Marche...Fresh meats are there for you to order making your favorite dish, salads, sandwiches, pizzas... large variety.. Good collection of beverages as well.
A bit expansive than the average... Value for money...
4
the food was amazing. the savoury crepes are a must try. ambience is very nice and different . it looks like switzerland
4
I visited this place on June 13,2015. The foods variety was excellent. The choices of drink needed to add more. German beer was a good choice. The foods I ate was nice. This shop seem nicer than the one in 313 for quality of cooked foods.
5
We go our for lunch every Wednesday and even if there are tons of places to eat around Vivo City, it seems like Marche is our default place to go. My husband and I are foodies and devout cooks and so the open kitchen idea appeals to us because we can see how they prepare the food. Also, they use quality ingredients. Check out their rosti, this simple dish never fails to hit the right spot. The soup station is also great, everything taste like homemade. They also do a good job of preparing crepes with fresh veggies of your choice. Of course the salad bar is to die for. You must try this place. You can go to their branch at Vivo or Suntec City
5
The theme is to visit several counters under the Marche roof Starting from Huge Salad bar with innumerable choice of greens & pulses, sea food Bar, Red meat bar, Vegetable bar, fresh fruit juices bar & the most awesome & epic Dessert bar. You can pick whatever dishes you wish & take the table - We chose dish of day - Slow cooked Salmon with tartar sauce & vegetable sidies & fresh watermelon juice foll by divine Coffee soufle & cheese cakes _ Would visit this place each time I am in Singapore for sure. Sl pricey but every bit worth the spend
4
Went here for lunch. It looks small on the outside but inside there are ample seating areas. Lots of food choices. There are high chairs for babies. Ambiance is nice. Looks out partly to universal studios. Ingredients are spread out before you. I think they change menus from time to time. I had vegetable pasta which is really tasty and healthy and had fresh watermelon juice for drinks. Sadly the juice was really bland as I prefer a sweeter one. Service is okay. Staff were accommodating especially the one at the entrance. Cards are accepted as payment. Candies are also sold. There's free taste too which is great as the candies were yummy! This is one of the tasty restos in SG as most restos here serve bland food. Seems like people here are really living a healthy lifestyle. Would come back again if given a chance
3
The ambience and the concept is innovative and quite relaxing, with individual 'shopping' at different food stations. However, the actual food is average at best. Any dessert containing egg tastes quite offputtingly of raw egg, so I would suggest giving those a miss; most of the food is also overwhelmingly oily; and cocktails are lacklustre. That said, it's still worth the price for the ambience and the pizzas, waffles, paella are pretty decent
1
The employee was chewing gum whilst making my caesar salad.
Then he stopped midway to chat with some customers even though it was past 2pm and empty. As for the caesar salad the dressing slipped of it because the leaves were watery.
4
Good Restaurant Italian/european cousine. We weee four people and we spent 110$ eating One main course each. I suggest it.
4
Went for brunch on Saturday with a dear friend, amazing service and the pizza was hot, crispy and fresh. I did not enjoy the crepe as the ham stuffing was quite less. A bit pricey as well.
3
We went for coffee and cake at Marche@ Vivo City today. We found that they have no play area for kids( not kids friendly place). The other Marche@313 is better with nice play area for kids.
5
This is one of my favorite places to have a nice lunch/dinner with my big mug of a nice german beer. I've tried many different options in food here and most have been fantastic till date. Lamb Chops with potato mash and a big mug of beer has been my all time favorite since time unknown. Seafood options are fantastic as well. You can even go for the gourmet pizzas - they are lovely.. I've been to different branches of MarchÃ© but the one at VivoCity is the place to go. Somerset is equally good as well
4
It took placed at Vivo City near waterfront MRT station. Barbeque with any of choices (seafood, chicken, pork), pizza, middle east food, variety of salad, cakes, ice cream...fiuuuh, make you like shrink into the pool of food.No matter you are halal or non halal eater, you just choose the fits one for you.At the end of the eat journey, you will find a complimentary green candy at the door out, hmmm....sweet and sour taste come together as a nice couple.Never feel enough except your stomach said so.......perfect
4
Whenever we are in Singapore we ensure we have at least one or two lunches from Marche. The quality of their premade rolls and pastries is always great as well as their beautiful loaves of bread. Cannot recommend highly enough. We even buy bread to take back to Myanmar
3
Started eating at Marche in Somerset in 2012 and found it simple food at above average prices. Usually ordered foods that need to be cooked up. Initially was okay. Then over last year realized that these are restaurant prices being paid for self service food. Yes you have a huge variety to choose from but it's all average quality foods. Asked for a fish to be cooked. Tasted average but I was happy till few hours later when I got really sick. That was at somerset and never returned there again. But recently was taken to vivo city with friends and service wise it was very poor. They just didn't clear the tables and we were big group and ate lots. It was still average food. As I'm not desperate for the variety (which is perfect for families and those who want quick food) but I would avoid Marche as much as possible.
5
This is a buffet restaurant which has nice atmosphere and decorated in the Alpen style.Service is good, food is very fresh and not bad. It is a bit on the expensive side but you pay for what you get. It is best not to go during the lunch hour or dinner unless you don't mind constantly queueing for the table, then the food and drinks. However, local people don't mind queuing and I suppose they get used to it in the hawker centres and have become their culture. I won't go there for a relaxed meal unless it is not in the busy time
2
Waited in a queue for a table. Shown to one that was dirty from previous customers.You have to go to different stations for your food. So queue for salad, queue for meat or fish to accompant it.Queue for everything!Resulting in everything is cold when you sit down at a different time from the rest of your group. Very far from ideal when you have children in the group.The food is bland, does not look or taste fresh and very much overpriced for small portions.Salad dressing? Condiments? Just gave up looking
4
Love the buffet type of setting but quite expensive. Great selection of wine and their pizza was great. Long queue for getting a table though. expect to spend roughly 30-50 sgd per person.
5
The restaurant from the outside is so appealing and the cow statues at the facade of Marche' makes me and my family more curious that makes us come in and dine. This place is good for vegetarian and health concious people as they serve organic or food that are preservatives free and the ingredients of the food were fresh. We even tried their German drinks (I forgot the brand) which is our first time to have tasted. Though the price if converted to Philippine peso is a bit high but with the quality of ingredients used in the food that were served to us, I can say its value for money. If you wish to buy fresg veggies you can buy from the restaurants too. Nice place, good ambiance
5
We had one of our best meals in this place . The Restaurant is conveniently located on roof top of Vivo City . It has great casual style of sitting and has nearly everything you can expect out of Swiss cuisine.  We were pleasantly surprised to have champagne by Glass and the Pizza's and crepes were just out of the world .We also tried on salad section and it was fresh as garden , very hospitable staff and true value for money .Cheers and keep up the good work 
4
Situated in Suntec City, the restaurant/cafe offers a range of counters with different styles of food. Take a card on entry, the staff enter on the card the food you have purchased, pay on exit.I have eaten in the Marche Movenpick cafes in other cities and the one in Singapore is of a good standard. A good choice of restaurant, particularly if you have children who all want something different
4
I have visited Marche on different occasions at least 5-6 times so far with colleagues, friends & family. Every time i visit, i try to taste a different cuisine. They have variety of cuisines. The place is set up like a Swiss market with different counters for fresh fruit juices, ice cream, salads, crepes, seafood, pizza, hot drinks, cold drinks, soups, meat etc etc. As soon as you enter, each visitor is given a card which you use to make food purchases at different counters & finally make a payment. All the food is prepared freshly in front of your eyes. The place has an authentic feeling to it. During my last visit I had ordered a piazza and was waiting in queue for another crowded place. By the time my pizza was ready & i could not leave the queue where i was standing. After collecting my dish i went to the pizza counter to collect the pizza. I was told that since i did not collect it in time, they three it in the bin & were preparing a fresh one for me. The Swiss Rosti is quite a hit & highly recommended. The different types of crepes are also quite delicious. The prices of most items are slightly on the higher side. E.g. A small bowl of mix salad costs about 7 SGD. The Margarita pizza is around 18 SGD. GIVEN THE FRSHNESS & the quality of ingredients, I wouldn't mind paying this price once in a while. I have not tried the different varieties of tea. On my next visit I intend to try it. The staff is friendly. Just make sure you don't loose the card. There is a penalty for loosing the card. 
2
Price more to local and less taste compare in SwissRosti instead of salt, they put sour creamSteak OkPaela nice. If you lucky, you will get more if your order is last portion :)Salad more to local salad variantCake nicepastry not bad Try to have lunch here, they have lunch promotion. With less than $15 you can get decent meal with swiss decoration. They also provide kids activities. Somerset branch have wooden house and lift for your pra

We went here by chance after looking around for something to eat. We were shown to a nice table and our drinks order was taken. We had full visibility of the open kitchen. The place was quite busy but service was still good. Between us we had lamb, steak and pasta dishes. These were all really tasty and served piping hot. When the bill arrived it was $120 for food and drinks
5
Each customer is given a card when they enter (kids get a separate kiddie meal card). There are various stations such as juice, rosti, pizza etc and you can walk around and pick up what you want at each station. Every time your card is swiped and at the end of the meal the cards are added up for total bill. My daughter thoroughly enjoyed this concept and loved going around to various stations. We had the rosti, a grilled veggie wrap and french onion soup. The meal sizes are huge and can easily serve two. The juices are super fresh. There are so many food options that one visit is not sufficient. Try going as a huge group if you want to sample what Marche has to offer. Great concept, nice ambience, amazing food

I have never heard of this restaurant and was very impressed by the concept. However, I was disappointed when a chef at one station offered chicken to a Swiss Rosti for my daughter. Having not been to one of these restaurants before, I hadn't realised that the chicken was an additional cost. I was never advised and I assumed, the chef was swapping the chicken for the original product. Then there was a charge for cheddar cheese. Meals were nice, but the extras did increase the price. I loved the store at the 'Suntec' Mall. There were a number of stations with a great range to choose from. It was an expensive dinner for the family, but always great to try something new
3
Nice place, nice ambience, very good variety and satisfactory quality. But I really wish more of the people here would smile while dealing with customers. That would make all the difference. Many of them are robotic and expressionless while a few seem quite unhappy to be here. Most unfortunate.
5
Marche is a nice change from the standard restaurant atmosphere. a semi-buffet style restaurant, where each dish has a cost, is excellent for having great food without overeating in a typical buffet.
2
Had breakfast and had to wait for 30minutes as the kitchen had lost the order and the staff had not noriced until we had to remind them.Found them also to be dismissive and unapologetic .
4
Like walking in to a Marche back in Switzerland. Traditional food. Great ambience. A bit pricy but all seems fresh and everything is clean and true to the original recipes.Well living in Switzerland I should not go here. But some times in asia you just get tired of noodles.
5
Actually we visited the newly opened branch at Suntec mall, Singapore. Its always a pleasure to visit this place. small village market type set up & great food. The fresh juices a great start to the evening, then some lovely starter & some bread with olive oil, + spices start off the long evening. A good bottle of wine always a great company with friends to catch up with. Enjoyed a lot
4
We were a group of 5 freinds & family and went for dinner.The resturant was completely full, nevertheless the staff were managing the show very systematically.The food choices available catered to almost all tastes. All the items which we ordered were excellent.Definitely a place to visit again
4
This is the most unusual eating place ,the style of the decor originates from Europe .It looks and feels like a grocers shop in a quaint timber building,the aroma from the food there is awesome we only visited for icecream after our meal at Jpot Restaurant So will eat at Marche next tim
3
These restaurants are made to look like Alpine markets & I find that very interesting. The variety available is very good - soups,juices, fresh fruit, salads, all kinds of seafood, lamb, pork, beef, sides, breads. The prices are definitely high. Everything is fresh & very hygienic. The meat items are completely unseasoned. You must add seasoning after they've cooked it for you. The Rosti is very good. It can be pretty crowded at meal times, especially during dinner. If you go during meal times, be prepared to wait for a table
4
I must admit I have passed this Restaurant few times at Vivo (it's on the roof top) believing it was a kind of Food Republic food court, until I was taken inside for lunch.This has been a real good discovery. The ambience, the large variety of Food, the lay out makes it for me the best choice now if you are having a lunch in Vivo.Art the entrance you are given a card onto which you will be debited whatever food you will choose to have, to be paid at the exit, including drinks. This is a very good system and the whole process is certainly easy. Each stalls inside bear different food from appetizer, salads, meat, fish, to end with an excellent choice of a variety of desserts.Child friendly, it's also a good choice if you just want a brunch or a cup of coffee and a cake.Well done
4
Was their for a small gathering with friends. We each walk around and pick up different dishes which we shared. The pork knuckle were great, but the fried potatoes ones was not well fried. For that range of price, I found it good value for money
5
Just have to say that anyone going to Singapore, must try Marche..at least once if not more.The food and ambience is simply amazing. The concept is so different you won't find it elsewhere. If nothing at all i would say just go and take in the ambience. :
4
I went there for lunch and had a great time selecting from quite an extensive range of food.
Deff a place worth visiting especially if you have children with you too.
4
Go there for the food. Service can be rather contradicting at times.
Love love love the ambiance. =)
5
I have not eaten here yet actually because it's always crowded I do not want to queue. But then. I always take away. Lots of breads and pastries. Theirs are so yummy and tasty
3
I only have good words to say about the food, but I did find the staff a bit too stiff and scary. Usually, when you're at a restaurant, you shouldn't be bound by so many rules. It was a turn-off when my friend told me that if we were to dine at Marché, I am not to do this and this and this. I was even told that they don't like taking photos of stuff when inside the restaurant .. that was so strange especially in this day & age when everyone takes food shots. I hope to have a batter experience next time
5
This is my standard place to eat when i want to be happy in singapore. great fresh food, the Paela is brilliant, the crepes are lovely but the rosti takes the cake. And the sausages are also lovely so is the seafood; the calamari and fish fillets. And fresh fruit juices. Their lunch express makes it value for money else its a bit steep. Lunch express is only on weekdays and gives you a meal combo for lesse

On 25/10/2014, my family and I went to this restaurant for lunch. We had quite a big group which about 16 people, so when I asked the receptionist at the front counter whether they have a table big enough to fit all of us and her reply is so standard like a robot, ïnside got table, please go in, inside got table, please go in, inside got table, please go in"I was expecting that she will lead us to the table but we have to go in and look for the table ourself. When come to ordering food from the grill station, the face of the service person is like he just had a very bad day, no smiles and don't bother to reply if you ask him anything. Worst is my relatives wanted to order some grill chicken and he stood there for like more than 10 min and he just can't be bother to serve. Very poor service and unfriendly staff in relation to the price that we pay for the lunch
5
From the ground floor and their bakery whcih has lovely stuff to the basement which is an amazing place with the most amazing way it is decorated to the way it is laid out and the foodit is reasonably priced for Singapore I might add considering the pizza and salad and beer we had it was worth every penny we spent and the time we ha
5
I loved the way, you can shop your food. The place is beautiful , wooden floors and a feeling that you are in the Alps. The food is always tasty, we have tried the oven baked pizzas and the rosti -and had a gala time there. I love going there again and agai
5
They have something for everyone..... I.e. you can practically get the baseline ingredients & have them make anything for you.Basically you enter the restaurant & they give you a top up card.You then go to any stall order what you want & the then add what you like to it, they have a very help yourself policy to everything.They will service anything you want plain & then you add the bits you want.Perfect for any fussy eating.....i.e. you can’t go wrong! it’s like having your own chef they will make anything you want!Its basically a market under a roof with everything most people could want in food and drink
4
I was with my colleague and we went for "Sweet Temptation" that afternoon. Quite a good deal for a beverage and a cake at S$6.90+.I had the Chocolate Apple Crumble, it was quite a generous serving of a big slice of cake. Taste pretty good with rich chocolate and the chunk of apple inside.I just had a regular coffee....now here's the catch.I was being served by someone who had sore throat that day and he couldn't even speak clearly to us.The Sweet Temptation deal was not displayed clearly for us what are the limited selection we can have......You see, my colleague and I were trying extremely hard to communicate and understand the selection involve in this deal...........i even asked him to seek someone else to talk but he refused......(i hope this is not the strategy of the management.... :)...)So, in the end....i have to settle with just a normal brewed coffee for the day....that's the deal.Overall, I still like the ambient and the food... a little expensive but really a good place to have a chat during meal time..
4
Great variety of European food all under one roof with fresh meat and vegetables on display. Freshly made rosti, pizza, pasta, salads , risotto. Good place to come for a change.
5
i love their pastries so much that i always dropby to bring home takeaways. lately a friend brought me here for a dinner and had me try the one of the crepe dish. it was so yummy i want more!
3
I love all their crepes. I love the way they cook it. Also, i love all their breads. I always see to it that i take away something before leaving the place:)
4
Im not a big fan of bread and pastries but when i tried their products it was really very good. I even brought home a box of sweeties.
1
was at their somerset outlet recently.
overcharged for a fruit cake slice.
fb them my feedback. till now till not received the said response by mail.
4
Wide variety of food options and a wide range of freshly prepared food ranging from pizza, pasta, pork knuckle, seafood, salads to risotto!However, the menu stays the same and does not vary but still good to visit occasionally.Highly recommended for dates, semi-informal business meetings and they even a kids section to keep the young ones busy
3
I enjoyed a very nice serving of Mixed Greens, with vinaigrette and Smoked Salmon. It was a generous serving, with a piece of pizza bread - quite tasty. To accompany this, I got a Bloody Mary cocktail. Very nice, thanks. They don't muck around either, the service is swift and food comes pretty quickly. I'd come here again.
5
This is one of my favorite restaurant in Singapore. Every time when i am visiting Singapore, this is a must go place.I have never tried a single "bad" food since i patronizing this restaurant. Everything is good and freshly cooked. Don't forget their dessert and German draft beer. Very tasty. I would recommend the salmon fillet, steak, rosti, Belgium waffle, apple crumble pie and baked potato
4
I've been to the Marches at Somerset & Vivo City a couple of times. The ambiance and set up is so welcoming - it's colourful, the food looks fresh, and the service is friendly. Since the Rosti came highly recommended, I had that the first time - topped with a fried egg and a side of sour cream. Despite not being a huge fan of potatoes, I absolutely loved it! It was crisp and soft at the same time and went perfectly with the egg.The second time around I had the savoury crepes with the Vegetarian Anti pasti - the crepes were thin and fantastic, the sauce-roasted vegetables-salad-cheese combination filling was amazing. the portion size was perfect and the crepes in themselves were drool-worthy.The Special Juice of the day - Apple, Banana, Raspberry, Mint, Lychee Syrup - was another highlight. It was a tall, fat glass of pure juice - no added water or ice, and it was truly refreshing! I also sampled a friend's dessert crepe (Mascarpone filled topped with bananas and ice cream) and I really wished I'd ordered an entire portion of it - it was delectable.Every time I've visited Marche, I've come back feeling happy - it's never disappointed. The food is terrific
5
Best place to go for people looking for different veg options along with the best combination of taste, variety and ambience. I had a great experience by visiting this restaurant. The internal decor of each counter was attractive, looked so fresh with the presence of green vegs and fruits.We actually entered the place just to see that. Finally ended up with having more than what we wanted to have.Pasta was so delicious, dipped in great sauce and fresh veggies.Had so many options for toppings.Overall this restaurant gives you complete satisfaction of having great food and value for money
4
Try this if you are in the area, a lot of choices and cool place, set lunch menu for those in a hurry
4
The staff are always accommodating and a great way to dine in a market styled atmosphere. Love the Rosti and Paella there
5
The options at just too many here.I have had the best Rosti in my life. I have been to Swiss also but I can assure you that the Rosti here is much better than what one gets in Switzerland.The spread here includes pizzas, greens, roasted veggies, pastas, Rosti with different toppings to name a few ..Its equivalently a vegetarians delight as it is for others. Would visit again for sure if in Singapore by any chanc
4
I believe this is a chain restaurant, but don't let that put you off. Concept is a food market where you can can browse through many different European cuisines, and select freshly prepared meals and side dishes. Your bill is added to a meal card as you "shop" for your meal. Meet up with your group and enjoy your meal and then pay on your way out. The model of Swiss efficiency with many delicious high quality meal options, including coffees and desserts.Great option when you need a break from Asian cuisine for an evening. Also nice for a relaxing lunch with a business group. I understand that this place gets very full for peak dinner times, so plan your timing or you could be waiting a while
5
The Marche Restaurant at Vivo City is a delightful to visit especially for dinner. The service is excellent and the food is outstanding. He best time to is for an early dinner at about 6pm when the sun is about to set and you have great views of the sea, the sun and the nearby resort island of Sentosa. As night falls the views are brilliant with strings of lights stretching as far as the eye can see. All this while you are dining as the restaurant has a unique oval shaped area with a glass wall. As it gets pretty crowded it is wise to book ahead to spend an evening here dining in style. If you have kids they will love the place even more than you 
1
Ambiance is great but there is noWarm accomodation. I guess you have yo help yourself . To get allYour condiments and utensils . The guy at the steak area was not accomodating,He seemed very tired and doesntTalk. But his body language and gestures are in a sarcastic way. Nobody checked on us if we have we needed anything. We have to call someone to ask for condiments . I even took the steak sauce from another table. We ate from the serving plates. Where are plates? Lol! Is that the way it should be?
5
I love the concept of Marche. Visual treat to see fresh produce stacked around and the system of using cards to stack up points and pay is very efficient. I've now been here a couple of times and will definitely go back when in Singapore next
5
Marche is not like anywhere I've ever dined before. You walk down the stairs into a basement that is neatly decorated. You get a dining card that you hand over at each station, and before leaving you stop and pay (no waiting for a bill-love it!)Rosti is amazing. I highly recommend the rosti breakfast special with sausage, bacon and an egg. Very flavorful. Cesar salads with homemade dressing made to order are delightful. Soups are always a great option, and are priced just right. Grab a slice of freshly baked garlic bread for your side. Roast chicken and mashed potatoes are a great choice. Freshly squeezed juices and a wide variety of desserts. Can't go wrong with anything here. Fresh, made to order and flavorful.Marche is one of my favorite spots in Singapore. A must stop
4
Pick meal and have it cooked to your taste. Hand over a card and pay at the end, before leaving. Basically it is buffet with your choice of selection. You pay for you eat. Good options for Vegetarians also. You can do advance booking. Worth a go. A great Idea. Rossti with sour cream was good. Staff must be educated to use different gloves/knives /spoons etc. for Vegetarian
4
A large group of us - 20 in all, went for a celebratory dinner. We had a reservation made 2 weeks in advance. It was really nice of them to put us in a somewhat private corner to create our own ruckus there. We arrived around 6 and the scenic seaview was there to greet us before entering. The greeter was very courteous and gave a very simple dos and don'ts of the place. A couple of guys and I shared a pork knuckle, a salami pizza, rossti with sour cream, a porkloin with baked potato and a sweet crepe at the end. Amazingly we were stuffed! The portion looks a little small but don't underestimate how filling they may be.Firstly, the pork knuckle was about 44 SGD. I must say it was sizable. The skin was crisp and the layer of fat was just glistening and inviting. The flesh was well cooked and juicy. Mind you it wasn't tough at all. The dip could have been a bit thicker into a gravy, but it tasted great nonetheless. The salami pizza was about 19 SGD. The dough was hand stretched before your very eyes... you can take a lesson or two at the counter :) When it's baked and done, they will buzz you on the queue calling system. Eat them piping hot and scald the insides of your mouth with the melted cheese.... oh so worth it....The rossti with sour cream was about 7 SGD. You might want to increase its nutritional value with sausages, otherwise it good just as it is. The potato was fully cooked and nicely crisp brown. It as heavenly. So what if I'm biased, I still love potatoes. The porkloin alone was about 14 SGD and was a little disappointing. It was over cooked and dry. Enough said.The sweet crepe was fabulous and affordable at about 9 SGD. Despite the 3 of us sliding into a food coma, we dug deep into our stomachs to accommodate it. They had a caramel spread on one side and a generous serving of two sliced bananas filling up a quarter. It was then folded into the banana quarter and drizzled with chocolate syrup. I gave myself a generous serving of sliced almonds, white and milk chocolate at the condiments counter.The tables are little small to support our feast but they cleared the tables faster than our mouths did the food. Overall it was a great experience...I would definitely visit Marche again
5
fabulous tenderloin steak....well recommended....! Service really good and great location opposite Raffles Hotel.
5
This is one of the nicest restaurant I have been in singapore. They have nice atmosphere and good food. I really want to go again.
4
I wasn't expecting the experience of Marche. Pick out a meal, have it freshly cooked and hand over a card to have it booked to you for payment as you leave. Basically a comprehensive buffet with food from around the world and all cooked fresh. Juices were great and the paella filling. Reasonably priced and worth a visit.
5
Food: A vegetarian will easily get good number of options. The veggie pizza in particular is very tasty with perfectly cooked toppings.Try the amazing cheese cake for desserts.Location: Can't ask for a better place than Vivo!Ambiance: Amazing decor. The vibrant colors of fresh fruits and veggies adds to the beauty
5
Amazing fruit juice in one of the stall near to the entrance, loved the apple + mango juuce very filling.. had a nice pizza very fresh as the bread is usually made after you place your order, my husband had stake and he said it was very tasty, all the above costed us upto 60 sing $ but I think for the ambience and experience you can visit marche on some imp occasions may be.. its definitely not a place you can randomly go and eat as u will find a lot more stalls in singapore with good food and less than 5$ but ya for a nice juice you can definitely go in just for the juice, they give each person a card in the entrance and when u get food in each coubter they just swipe the card and you gotto pay it all together while u exit marche. I would definitely recommend marche for a nice informal occasion
4
Been to this place 4 times and loving it every single visit. I like the location and the setting of their tables and chairs with ample space to move around (compared to 313 Somerset - Somerset is underground, dark and narrow) as I get a nice view of the food prepared by chefs behind the counter and also a great view of Harbour Front Walk. My favorite is their savoury crepe with lots of cheese and roasted chicken and sauteed mushrooms. Order anything you like and all you need to do is pass them your Marche card and they will do the rest. Ice creams, sweet crepe and waffles are available for the kids. For adults, wine and beers are also available, for those looking to stick to their healthy diet, fresh fruit juices are available! Payment is made when you exit the restaurant. Nice food, nice atmosphere, great location ! (after the meal you can visit Sentosa island, the monorail ride is just 3 mins walk from Marche)I will go back for more great family dining anytime
4
Love this restaurant every time we visit Vivo City. Nice concept of the store with some Swiss backdrop with great choices of food like pasta, vegetables, salad, seafood, meat, sausage, etc. My family love the rosti, calamari, sweet crepe, veggie, pork knuckle, and grilled chicken. A very relaxed atmosphere with a satisfying meal of fresh and healthy food is equals to a perfect meal. Upon entry to the restaurant, you'll be provided with a card then you can roam around to pick any food that suits your palate and use the card to pay. Upon exit, the card will be read to check/verify all that you order. Have a good one coz we always do
4
I have been visiting Marche Movenpick quite often recently. Our family loves their spicy salami pizza, smoked duck breast pizza and carbonara... They also offers complimentary apple and my children love it...on our recent visit, we tried their newly introduced sweet crepe... tried suzette crepe which is drizzled with orange puree and orange skin top with ice cream.. its not bad but not too my liking.. will want to try their other flavoured crepe on my next visit :)currently they also have this promotion for their marche card, top up $50 and get additional $5 in the card, quite a good deal so have been going back to visit their restaurant!One plus point: They have toilet inside the restaurant and its easy for me... especially when i visit with my 2 kids alone... easier than dragging both kids to public toilet whenevr they need to pee or poomore photos and review:http://eatplaycook22.blogspot.sg/2014/06/eat-marche-movenpick-jem.htm

A quaint European eatery market setting that offers a wide variety of food and drinks. You can roam the restaurant and choose what best suits your pallette and place the order at the particular setup. Have a hearty meal whilst traditionally dressed up waitresses come up to you for any help needed with the food and cutlery.
5
Have been going to this restaurant for a while now and it is consistent with its quality and service.If you go with young children there is a play area that they love, so they can eat,play and adults can relax and sit back.The food selection is good with pasta/pizza/prime rib/steaks/pork/sausages/Spanish/fish/deserts/salad bar etc.What you get is a more relaxed atmosphere, its serve yourself with a card system,drinks are a bit pricy(as is alcohol in general in Singapore) you have to walk around and see what the choices are.Don't expect waiters to come to your table to take orders and it gets very busy during noon and early evening times.Its downstairs at the Sommerset MRT station or 313 Orchard Road
4
Great variety of foods, tasty but expect to pay correspondingly to it's worth. Indulgence and you leave happy.
4
Nice restaurant concept. Has this old European market settting where there are different stalls for variety of food that is freshly cooked when ordered. I had the Swiss rosti (similar to hash browns) with sour cream and spicy sausage which were washed down with fresh lemonade. The cook was helpful in suggesting what side dish would go with my rosti. The place also has a lift for wheelchair and baby pram accessibility
5
So many fresh food choices! Food is set up in stations; you mix and match and choose what you want. I've tried just about everything, never had a bad meal at Marche. Very reasonable prices. Great if you are visiting from the West and missing western cuisine. Great choices for kids, too. I wish they had one where I live in the US
5
I have been to Marches in Singapore many times by now, and I am always keen to return. Great variety, fresh and tasty food, I am never disappointed. I like their lunch offers at SGD 8,90, which I find a great value for main course and drink. I also like to pop by for afternoon tea, between 3-6 p.m., for a slice of delicious cake and freshly brewed coffee. Service has always been nice and friendly. I give this place five stars :
4
Right across the street from the world famous Raffles Hotel lies Marche, a cute corner cafe. Stopped for breakfast on one of my marathon walks. Met and welcomed at the entrance, got to select my seat. Order taken right away and served within minutes. I had the egg-white omelette with onions and spicy sausage, served next to a bed of greens. Washed it down with freshly squeezed grapefruit juice. Delicious. Started pouring outside so I ordered a cappuccino and happily nursed it til the rain subsided. I liked the fact that smoking wasn't allowed indoors. Would have liked wifi access, but may have caused me to have my nose in my phone instead of enjoying watching Singapore life pass by.Great little restaurant, great service, tasty breakfast. I'll come again
4
This is a great concept restaurant and lovely place to go with friends or family. They give you a card on the way in which you use to buy your food and then pay on the way out. Self service with a difference.They have a great choice of food and drink and it is generally well prepared, I particularly like the fresh squeezed apple juice and a Swiss rosti (fried potato with an egg on top)
5
An unforgettable experience for healthy indulgences cooked right before your eyes! One can feel, hear, see, smell and taste the food quality and freshness. You can go to several sections (Swiss Rosti, Soup, Wine, Vegetables, Sandwich, Pasta, Fresh Juice, Bakery, Dessert, Rotisserie, etc.) and get the dishes prepared with flexible choice of ingredients. Nice interiors and good ambiance there. Give a break to shopping at Vivo City to have lunch here
5
Delicious Swiss food at affordable prices. All dishes freshly prepared in front of your eyes with best quality of ingredients, spices and finger-licking good food. Steaks, Pizzas, Rosti, Desserts, Kids Combos, Juices - mouth watering options galore. Good hygiene, location and helpful staff. What else can one ask for in any eating joint !! Definitely worth a visit !
5
There is a huge variety of food served over here. There are many stalls with staff preparing fresh food on the spot. You just need to go and take the item which you want. The taste is really good and the ambience is good too. The place can get crowded during the weekends, so it is better to book ahead
4
Been there a couple of time during my stay in singapore and during my visit to singapore. Its more like multiple food counters within, an choose what you want. Typical to the la place restaurants which you come across in europe. Slightly expense however food is scrumptious and fresh. Worth a visit specially for a sunday brunch. However please note the place can get extremely crowded at times
4
We loved the variety of food and the concept. Pasta Dishes and Breads are must try ...
Staff are friendly . Place can get crowded during weekends .
4
liked the decor and concept, most of the staff superb, nice food some reasonably priced some not quite, will definitely visit again next time i'm there..
4
The restaurant is simply great. I tried the one beside Swissotel and found it Super.
they have a good variety of food and I enjoyed their Pizza very much. they have an outside seating area that is also very good.
5
My family ate at the Marche at Asia Square on a Saturday morning. The 2-for-1 pancakes & big breakfast were delicious. Good coffee and pleasant patio dining. Highly recommended!
4
Post Sentosa island visit we have discovered this restaurant. Best fresh food served here with lots of fun and love. Believe me this will definitely increase your hunger level at there entrance only. All fresh food and beverages served, what I liked more is they make food in front of you. The ambiance, decor is nice..like you are sitting in real market, where you get piping hot fresh servings. Would like to visit again definitely...food bit expensive but you will love for sure. Do not forget to visit if you are at or around Sentosa
4
we accidentally discovered that place on the way to Sentosa island. Hostes gave us a quick informative beefing at the entrance and then it was just walking around and picking up "the stuff".All the food looks fresh, it`s well displayed, cooked by service minded staff. I just gave up the line for potatoe rostis - I dont like lines :). Over all - very pleasant experience
4
The restaurant at Vivo is nicely decorated and quite well spaced. I like the concept and relaxed ambience, the food generally looks enticing... Pasta gratin and desserts were delicious. Some prices are alright but some are overpriced.The steak could be better if it comes with some veggies and not just plain steak at that price, needs to be prepared more tender, juicier and tastier. Overall, enjoyed the meals. Will be back again
4
We chanced upon the Marche Restaurant and chose the lunchtime special. The staff were very helpful in explaining the way in which the restaurant operated. It is visually very pleasing and enticing in the way in which the different food choices are displayed. We both chose the pork ribs with potato gratin. The ribs with pepper sauce were tasty and succulent My only concern was that the gratin dish was not hot and slightly undercooked. The choice of drinks was included in the lunchtime special offer and our choice of fresh orange with hibiscus was a good one. We would certainly eat there again
4
the best part about this joint is the consistency. the variety is also great - especially in the dessert section. the rosti is great. so is the mushroom soup. also the crepe. i just love the cheese sausage. the roasts are also quite good and the sauces to go with that especially the varieties of mustard add the right sort of zing. the food is fresh and the staff are nice. the only issue is that the table clutter in terms of trays and used crockery and cutlery is not cleaned up too quickly. no complaints about the food though. the portion sizes are good. the pricing is not that bad relative to the quality and portion size but it is not cheap. looks like they have good options for vegans also. certainly good for a repeat
4
Very affordable but tasty dining. Everything is set out in live stations - the crepes, with chocolate sauce, strawberries and ice cream are great. The pasta and pizza are also fantastic. However, there are lots of different choices like fish, steak, swiss potato rosti etc and its all cooked in front of you. Its quick, fresh and very reasonably priced. Its also very popular with locals. Highly recommend
5
Variety to food items at your disposal ... live cooking and cooking to your taste and choice..
Fish and Seafood variety is awesome and cooked to perfection.
A must visit place for all.
4
Food is good, but the price is probably too high for what you are getting. Great concept, but I still think there are better options available!
4
We found this place in the Somerset mall area. Wanting a change from Asian food, we tried their restaurant (actually like a food court set up) and had the pasta carbonara, sausage pizza and apple pie and vanilla ice cream. Quite good but a scoop of vanilla ice cream will set you back more than S$5
5
Marche, Where did the term came from? This European restaurant is pretty cool both the food and the ambience. It's like you were in a marketplace with fresh variety to choose from and then there are chefs eagerly ready to cook your meal based on your ingredients.Desserts are everywhere, a dime a dozen. And you don't need to queue to pay right pay. Enjoy the food first. mind you, the price is higher than i imagined.
4
The Marche restaurant at Vivo City is known for its pretty interiors, lovely food and unique dining concept. Though a tad expensive as compared to other restaurants, it is an experience in itself and a must visit for its fresh and interesting food. They give each customer a card at the entrance and as you go within, you see that there are different food stations such as Pizza, Pasta, Desserts, Rosti, Drinks etc. These stations are situated in the centre of the restaurant and seating arrangements are all around. There is plenty of space to sit and different seating styles, so it is better for a new comer to first tour the entire place and accordingly then, place their order and choose their seating. My favourite is the last room near the exit which I find nice and cosy. When it comes to food, I completely drool over their Original Swiss Rosti which is served with Sour cream. Simply divine! They have a few home made drinks like Apple Lemonade which is quite average. Last I tried (accompanied by my Rosti, of course!) was their Stir fried veggies, which were available in Small, Medium and Large size bowls. There were 4-5 plates of stir fried veggies on display. I was simply handed over an empty bowl (being the size I had selected) and was asked to fill it up with veggies as per my choice. Now how cool is that!Marche is open till 11 pm, which is good for those coming late from Sentosa and wishing to grab a quick bite or drink. Of course, it is important that the chef at the food station at which you wish to eat is present at that time. Some of the staff can be a bit irritating (mainly in the evening) as they keep coming to you from time to time reminding you of the time until which they would be taking the last orders, asking whether you have made payment or not etc. They seem to be in such a hurry to clear up the dishes, notwithstanding the fact that the restaurant is barely 40% full and you are yet to finish your entire meal. Not to forget the fact that there is still plenty of time for the restaurant to close. If you choose to ignore these silly issues, Marche can be a great dining experience

Visited marche at jem, singapore several times over the last couple of months. I must say the food is generally consistently good.We usually have pepperoni pizza which comes in a huge portion and it's very yummy. The spaghetti carbonara is highly recommended too, very creamy and it comes with this baked garlic bread thingy which is very nice plus it also comes with a portobello mushroom, totally worth it.Also had their chicken wings on one occasion and it's very yummy too. It's marinated well and even my kids love them.Sometimes during weekday they have one for one beer or one for one coffee and it is really good promo.However, not a lot of seats and if does get crowded during meal time...and they only have limited numbers of baby high chair..But other than , everything else is good. They even have toilet inside the restaurant!!
1
Where do I start?Well maybe at the beginning. The welcome was none existent - The staff have the personality of toilet cleaners - Procedural (but not good procedures), un-interested and down right rude. Actually, the restaurant cleanliness was actually worse than a hawker centre."Wait a" translates into English that they "will find you a table and lead you there". Not that they inform you they will be closing at 20:45 and not everything is open during your visit.Now onto the food...Pasta - overcooked and soggy (so bad we had to take it back because it was more like rice porridge)Garlic bread - Yes; it was garlic but not that I could taste it - it was too hard! Solid as a rock. Garlic Brick. New dentures tomorrow.Rosti - "No potatoes Sir" (When there are 2,000 potatoes on display inside the restaurant as themeing in front of the rosti kiosk)Orange Juice - Flies with that sir? Yes, there was a dead fly inside it. "OK" he replied (man of few words). Replaced with new one using exactly the same jug the first one was poured from! hahaThe Senior Team:Roger - the most uncharismatic General Manager I have ever had the misfortune to cross paths with. "We know we have flies; maybe tomorrow they come to fix it?" "I can't inform the guest that things will be closed when they first sit down" [They manage to in other restaurants i've eaten in?! It's not exactly difficult with a team of 20 all in close proximity and radio communication as seen]June - "Not available for a customer complaint; i'm in the washroom"Employee of the month - BLANK! (See attached photo).A memory i'd rather erase. Go elsewhere, please.Credit where credit is due; they were persistent on taking the money for the food at the end!Why are you even open if you know you have a fly problem... I invited Roger to try his food - he refrained. I guess prison food would be nicer but I've not had the pleasure of prison.This is crazy that they can get away with this. It looks a lovely restaurant with great food which is well presented in a casual environment but it's such a shame what it really has become :-

The first time I experienced Marche was in Boston almost 10 years ago as a university student on a tight budget, and i was blown away. The 'Suisse Village' concept with an amazing variety of cuisine and dining options with authentic ingredients was a refreshing experience. Being able to experience that since 2006 in Singapore, has been great as well. The great thing about Marche is the consistency of the food, service and atmosphere. Some might find it a bit expensive, but i think when it comes to really good quality food, especially the kind and type (cuisine-wise) that you have on offer at Marche, it's completely worth it, cause it isn't necessarily a place you might visit every week. A couple of times a month, sure! Yes, you can get better pizza and pasta elsewhere and possibly a salad too. But a few things, like the crepe, Rosti, paella and dessert spread are simply outstanding. You really cannot ask for much more than a tasty, wholesome meal in a great atmosphere and Marche delivers
1
I used to love coming to this Resterant, but it's been a few years which unfortunately has NOT benefit Marches. The once reasonable price is now expensive for what ur getting, the kind and polite staff are now either under trained or over whelmed as they are neither kind or polite. The kitchen staff never smiles and you'll be lucky to find a fork or knife... All in all very dissipating end as this used to be goo
4
Great food, a little expensive, but you won't be disappointed in the quality. A different concept, you get a card for each person, go from station to station, have your card swiped and pay as you leave. They swipe your cards at the register to give you your total check. They have a great carry out bakery and deli also that is reasonably priced
4
Pizza and crepes are our favorites here. Good location for the family. Fresh juice and desserts are quite nice. The potato pancakes are yummy. Easy to charge up a storm though!

This restaurant serves Swiss cuisine. At the point of entry, you will be given a card (credit card size) per person and it will be used for purchase of food. When you leave you present the cards to the cashier and pays the final bill.In my opinion, I find the food average and nothing special. We had a pizza, pork shank, bread and pasta, and drink - it was for 3 adults and a child and the amount was $80. We ordered not a lot and less than the amount for 4 person.Selection can be limited at times. The food was average and I find it overpriced given the quality. Perhaps this is true for eating out in Singapore - it can be expensive in restaurants
5
This place is very novel. They give you a card which you use to pay for the food and drink that you'd like. So, what happens is that you walk around and pick and choose from a huge variety of dishes made in front of you from various parts around the restaurant. You hand them your card and it adds the cost of the dish onto it which of course you pay for at the cashier. As said there is a huge array of foods with Swiss sausage, seafood, salads and much more available. Great for families as well. Loved it!!
4
Marche is an amazing restaurant based on a concept of a Swiss village & market place. That with a unique concept whereby you order & pay for your food through a issued Marche card. Restaurant has various stations serving so many options like soup, salad, meat, pizzas, pasta seafood, rosti, crepe, drinks, dessert, etc
3
We went to this place 2 years ago and thoroughly enjoyed it. This year it was a big disappointment the choice of food was limited. I had pan seared tuna and although I was good I had to wait 15 mins so everyone else was finished
4
-Location: Somerset-Had dinner here with a loved one and a few friends. My friends have actually been there many times before so they have tried many of their dishes already-The restaurant boasts of its wide range of choices from German dishes, to Swedish to Italian to American.-Great place to celebrate a family milestone - bday/graduation/visitor-Family-friendly-Get ready to spend-Buffet-type, where you could visit different stations with different dishses-Uses a small card to register all your purchases from the different stations-Billing out by surrendering your card-Just try everything out !-Come early because there is a long, never-ending queue as this restaurant is very popular-Efficient hostess-Servers are okay-Overall experience was great
4
I love the idea of using marche card for transaction and pay in the end. I went with a large group of people and we would like to pay seperately and it's possible in marche. Good food too but most importantly i love the coffee that came with huge cup and the cakes!!
4
we went there with our guests from philepines. and had a gala time.the advantage of marche is all of us can have our own favorites. pizza, rosti, meat is good. desserts/icecream choices are plenty. freshly squeezed fruit juices are nice. i also liked there hot organic tea
5
Marche was something that happened by accident. Being the foodie that I am, I was with my family at the marche bakery, when I stumbled upon the basement restaurant 2 years back. Since then I must have been here on 25plus occasions.The chicken and cheese sausage with rosti and the ceased salad are my favorites. My wife swears by the wraps and I by the mousse.Excellent portions.stuffing in wrap so and toppings of salads is very very generous. Everything is absolutely fresh , right from grocery to meat.Good secure place for kids to play while you eat in peace.excellent array oft fresh fruit desserts.Must must go if you love food (veg or non veg
4
Cravings for large, yummy & tasteful pizzas??!! Check out MarchÃ© (MRT exit at Cityhall, right opposite Raffles hotel). They've whole or half size of pizzas & we had 2 different pizzas (parma ham with rocket salads & smoked duck pizzas) for 4 person which is a lil too much cos they're seriously huge with lots of fillings! Both are very different but equally good! ;)We also ordered desserts which is much like some yogurt drink in short glasses (SD12 for 3) but was pretty disappointed with this as it was just too watery! So skip the desserts & order another pizza perhaps?! ;
5
This Restaurant is a must try in Singapore if you haven't been there in other countries.. its a totally different experience in F&B,
i like the atmosphere and the food it self is so tasty..
5
I am so regualr at Marche's that my friends call me the ROSTI KING...everything about this joint is good...from the fresh juices to the delicious dishes....if you are a first timer...dont forget to miss out on the ROSTI...
5
Great food in a homy atmostphere. Probably the best place to eat breakfast or lunch. Over all it was simply great.

Been to this particular outlet a couple of times in the past before this review.Marche Restaurants have their own unique style and feel to the restaurants that they have. Dinners are usually not crowded, but overcrowded. There's always a queue at the door, and in my opinion, the queue could be better managed at the entrance as well. The waiting area is right in the way of the door, so getting in and out seems to be an issue when everyone is not really cooperating. Food can be good and well cooked, depending on the time and season that you eat there. Had a couple of weekday dinners where food quality was significantly better than the last dinner I had there which was on a weekend (Saturday).That particular Saturday, the sirloin steak was miscooked. A medium became a mess of well done on top, and completely raw in the middle. Pork steak was a tad hard as well, and under- or un-seasoned. Calamari Rings were unpresentable by any standards, the fried flour covering was over cooked in overly-heated oil. A caucasian had the unfortunate mispleasure of discovering that the cream used in the pasta, is not freshly made as per Marche's signature slogan, but unpacked from packets that you can buy off the grocery store. Crepes were a slight comfort among the mess. The pizza was not topped properly, misaligned. Juices were still alright (if you can't get juices right, you should shut down. That's a comfort). Cutlery is also usually a hidden gem should you find it in the right holder. On that particular Saturday (17th Aug 2013), it seemed the staff were all, and I mean all, in a generally foul mood. Nothing was cooked right, restaurant was overcrowded with people rushing from counter to counter to table, queuing for food.The again, having a bunch of people staining almost the entire restaurant after The Color Run, isn't something great to have in your restaurant is it
4
I have been to Marche couple of times . First impression when you enter the restaurant is quite unique and gives you kind of countryside feel. As inside you will find variety of counters with different speciality. Liked the variety but personally don't find it value for money . Certain counters specially with non veg food were expensive.So overall for a family meal you have to shell out few extra bucks
5
last night,my daughter,son in law and me we went to this fabulous restaurant called MARCHE.It was at 313@Somerset,near Orchard Plaza.the first impression was that as I enterered in a swiss farm and village.we were given a swipe card.we had to go to whichever counter,take a plate,swipe the card.then you pick up the food .the display of the name with the price was very simple but crystal clear.vegetables and ingredients were all staked up in the open.that itself was very inviting.we ordered a spanish paella,a dish of salad(allthat your plate can hold),then a pizza.the fried garlic,green pesto and the cheese were superb .which came along with the pizza.real VFM>Value for MONEY.the decor of the place with a farm house,swiss flags and the animals,the calves,the sheep,the way the cutlery is stored for use was just amazing!missing something if you dont go here
4
This is one restaurant which my kids insist on visiting again & again. They love the rosti & sausages the best, whereas I find myself piling on their Paella. It is also a safe bet to take overseas visitors as there is enough choice for the most pickiest eater. Choosing your own dish rather than mass orders seems a good option when you have a crowd with diverse tastes. Love the decor and overall feel of the place, too.The only reason I have not given an excellent rating is because I feel there is a big margin for improvement in dessert section. Though the desserts are not bad at all, they seem repetitive, relying on rich & heavy factor, which gets boring after a few visits. But even with this minor gripe, Marche would still be our family's most visited restaurant
4
Marche is great for breakfast and dinner and the food is very high quality. The card system is great, as it allows you to buy from various stalls, and pay at the end. The prices are, however, very high, and it is easy to lose track of how much you have bought
4
The concept is very original (European market) and the food delicious and at a reasonable price. The restaurant recreate a mountain-Swiss environment which gives a good atmosphere but it is not well done as the Somerset's. This Marche has less diverse food compare to the Somerset 313 one. This Marche is located in Vivo City so if you go to Sentosa for the day, it's the perfect occasion! Overall I still strongly advise you to go over there to feel like you just spend a day skiing in the Swiss mountains !
5
I'm a sucker for fruits and fresh veggies. It's like going to a marketplace, you pick your choice of ingredients then wait for the chef to make magic with your food! Enjoy a wide variety of European culinary delights. Just one tip though, it's better to come here when you are not that starving. Reserve at least 30mins of your time for queuing.
5
Huge choice of meals they cook in front of you. Very tasty, very cozy. One of the best place to eat European kind of food when you are in Singapore. Nice location on roof top of Vivo City.
5
Love this place. the bakery is so delicious. For dinner try the crepes and for dessert have the waffles and vanilla ice cream :)
4
I had the best chocolate crepe there with fresh cream! It was better than any crepe I had in Europe! The restaurant looked very neat, really nice atmosphere and nice decorations. The food was delicious.
4
i am a potato dish lover....i love their ROSTI>>>> it feels home when I dine there....as I am a farm girl too...
good food shared with great friends.....the experience was one of a kind
3
the paella was good, child friendly, and the choices are vast.. so its a good place to go to, though might be crowdy on a weekend
5
When I visited Singapore, my sis-in-law and brother took me to this restaurant. I was so impressed with the place! There are various of viands to choose from. though the place could use more space coz it felt a little cramp I really enjoyed my experience in this resto. I'll definitely be back on my next trip to Sg
5
On every trip to Singapore, i make it a point to come and have a meal here at Marche, lots of food choices, drinks too, love the salmon salad, pork knuckles and their sausages, actually there is a lot more food that i cant remember eating, a little bit pricey cuz you'll be ordering more food than you can eat, still im going back this december
4
Quite a good selection of food - I had the rÃ¶sti and crepe for dessert. Both were excellent and so was the orange & carrot juice. The atmosphere was fine and the little Swiss area quite quaint but I felt the whole place could be a bit more spacious. The food was not particularly cheap considering there was no table service. Having said that I would most likely return!
4
A friend picked me up last friday night and took me to Marche', what a surprise, right in the middle of Singapore! It was GREAT! I loved how they give you a card and you can go to any station and they put the cost on the card, at the end of the evening you pay for what you ate. The prices are a bit on the high side but they have tons to choose from! I had a caesar salad with chicken, a really yummy roll and apple pie! They have also belgian waffles, gelato, a veggie bar, raclette, a full bar, juice bar, and I could go on. The salad was very good as well as the cheesy/garlic roll. The apple pie I have to say was a bit bland, being a baker and all, I know mine is better as well it was really cold and dry. If it had been a bit warm and had more juice it would have been wonderful. But considering this type of food so different from anything else I've ever had in Singapore it's a warm welcome to the traditional local cuisine, and the american restaurants which have popped up the past few years, i.e. Chili's :/ Anyway, a good time was had by all
4
First when we arrived some local girl wanted to take our order but she didn't understand us well,so she said she would call somebody else.Then a friendly german guy took prompt our order and after a short time our delicious tenderlion appeared at our table.Nice,tender and served with some potato wedges,BBQ sauce and a small ceasar salad.Nice venue for a meal with friends.We stayed just around the corner in Fairmon
4
Pork knuckles and rosti…. Rosti… rosti.. my fav… Soups there are nice and thick too. Pasta and salads are well done. I love the chilled flavored tea as well. I am never tired of going there!
4
Great quick and easy place for dinner. Has everything you would feel like, went with a group of 6 and it had everything any of us wanted. Worth a try.
4
A girlfriend and I went for Sunday lunch here - ducked into nearest restaurant when a typical Singapore downpour started - and we both really enjoyed it. We shared a pizza and a sald which were both huge and very tasty. Would definitely go there again when in the area
2
Me and hubby went on a Sunday for dinner. Place was already packed when we reached at about 7pm. It has been more than 7 years that I last stepped into a Marche so was looking forward to it. However it was pretty disappointing. There was some change to the menu. They are no longer serving fried soft shell crab which was a must eat dish last time. I feel the variety of food was also not much. In the end we ordered fried calamari, crepe wrapped with chicken, mushroom soup and rosti in smoked salmon. The mushroom soup was superb, texture was just nice. Fried calamari was just as tasty as it used to be. I used to order plain rosti so rosti in smoked salmon was a first time try for me. All in all, not bad. But the crepes with chicken couldn't make it. There were so much vege in it that I couldnt taste the chicken at all. There was queues every where and I think the layout of the restaurant was also pretty tight. I think I wouldnt go back again
4
The restaurant is decorated like a festive market in Switzerland, with abundance of selections and varieties, you can have what you wish to fulfill your appetite. We ordered deep fried dory fish, rosti and the famous pork knuckle, yet i felt the pork knuckle was not too cripsy, and not stand out, even the rosti tasted better.Although the price is a little bit high, the place usually packed with tourists and local people everyday..
4
the food was nice there is alot of selection like small little booth where a variaties of food is being prepared. you take the food and scan your card for payment later. downside is the food here can be quite costly. well what do you expect since you are in singapor
4
The most appealling thing about Marche is the ambience... made mostly of wood ( or wood like material ) it has rustic and authentic feel about it. The food options are great if you are a non-vegetarian and I'd say a decent spread for vegetarians too... My favorite would be the desert section. The crepes are a must have!!!
5
Marche is the place for freshly cooked healthy food! It's self serviced n you are free to walk round to pick your choice n watch it being cooked! You not only enjoy eating but also the beautiful scenery outside which one can see through its glass windows. One is spoilt for choice with its wide variety of food offered. Great food n great place to be. It's has now become one of my fave food restaurants n a restaurant with a difference! Eat n be merry guys! You will find yourself coming back for more
5
Ate at Vivo city's outlet. With a friend. Ordered Rosti, Paella, grilled chicken breast and smoked salmon crepe. Rosti was delicious with pork sausage, ordered an extra more! However, Rosti was sadly under seasoned. Added salt and pepper myself. Maybe that's the point? Well it tasted great with sour cream and spring onions so I ordered one more! Grilled chicken breast was delicious! Juicy tender moist in the middle well seasoned with rosemary I suppose! Paella, my favourite dish. Rice was delicious, however tomatoes on top was undercooked. Prawns juicy fresh, mushroom juicy not dry, paella rice was superb! Although I did waited thirty minute for it but it was worth the wait! Smoked salmon crepe was delicious although the sauce for it tasted nothing but butter, no seasoning at all drinks I ordered a malt drink non alcholholic cause it was in the middle of the day. . Taste like beer sweetened and a little disgusting for me. Now on to the design and atmosphere. Overall beautiful and great, feel like I'm not eating in a restaurant but Swiss market! Happy experience there. Staff friendly too! However there was a lack of fork and no one bothered to refill and I had to get it from another stand for fork.Pleasant and great experience, good food and atmosphere, worth the price tag, I also liked the idea of using cards to pay first for food and play at the end of the meal. 100$ for lost of card and is donated to charity of your choice seemed a little to harsh on customer don't you think so? Punishment of $100 is too much for me.
5
The whole place was an experience to have, from the service, food, and ambiance. I went to this restaurant twice the first was last December where I enjoyed the German Ham and the roasts and the 2nd time last February. In both visits, the crepe with ice cream was the one that always stood out. I also enjoyed the salads, the pasta and the paella but it was the crepe that I thought was the best that I had there. I think its even the best crepe Ive ever tasted.
5
Went with friends for fresh home-cooked pizza and delicious salads. The location is directly opposite Raffled and Chimes so perfect for vsiting other places for cocktails and sight-seeing.
4
One of the cuisines i relished, with the abundant variety and beautiful tastiness. Also, the service is quite unique so that, you get to your food in a quick way. Must try restuarant for people wanting to try some swiss cuisine.
5
is perfect when u want to have a quick and yummy bite to eat!
the location is not great, but you literally go, choose your food, seat, and eat! Every choice you will be happy!
4
Not everywhere you can walk off the 30degree, 80% humid street and feel like you are apres skiing in the alps! Great variety of food with interesting 'cash card' concept.
5
Enjoyed my visit with a friend. Nice selections; food was good. You choose for yourself, but laid out much differently than regular buffet
4
This place is set up Buffett style with different serving areas and everything you buy is placed on a card so you pay as you leave. There is a huge variety of freshly made food. I had a vegetable crepe which was huge and could easily feed two people. It was delicious and they have a wide assortment of fresh squeezed juices, which were so refreshing. Great ambiance and great food.
5
I have been a regular at Marche right since i landed in Singapore. The food is indeed very tasty and healthy too ! Some of the 'must try' items:1. Swiss Rosti2. Sea food - they have some really nice dishes3. Hand squeezed fresh juice4. 'Healthy breakfast' - wonderful mix of taste and healt
4
A varied buffet station style restaurant serving very fresh and good quality food cooked in front of your eyes.The food and format was particularly welcome by the Coeliacs in our party because even though the staff disn't understand the concept of intolerances/allergens, food could be chosen that met our needs. Through sign language we managed to get the frying pan used for the rosti cleaned before cooking ours.A pleasent change and most welcome in Singapore
5
Loved the food, the choice and the concept, You are given a card which you then walk around and choose what you are going to eat. You charge it to the card and then pay when you leave. I had a fabulous smoked salmon rosti and fresh carrot juice. Great..
4
A fresh food restaurant chain popular in Europe and Asia with an interesting twist on service and an excellent atmosphere. There is no menu to order from. They hand you a card upon entering the restaurant, you go around a number of preparation stations and select what you want to eat, hard your card to the food preparer and then to the cashier for payment when exiting the restaurant. The majority of the food is freshly prepared in front of you. A great variety of dishes are available. I greatly enjoyed the experience. Not sure if the concept would work in the United States due to the numerous hygiene and food preparation restrictions which seem to exist in every state.There is also a branch of this chain in the mall above Somerset MRT at 313 Orchard Road
4
After a walk at Sentosa we went to have an awesome meal w/ variety of European dishes to choose from at Marché. I like the place as well...
5
Different approach, many different stalls, good salad stall, good pizza and great potato rosti. Prices are a little steep but not too much. Also the german beer is quite good.
4
Marche is a good place to experience a little bit of Swiss Food! Operates with a e-card concept, swipe whatever you eat and order and pay in the end. From my non-veg counterparts, the food is excellent. Has a decent variety of servings for vegetarians - especially the Rosti. Marche is an open kitchen concept, therefore, you know what you are eating. They maintain a good level of hygiene and offer filling servings. Keep enough room for their deserts, i.e if you don't land up too late. They generally run out of it by mid evening
5
If you are a true lover of food then this is the place. Simply fantabullous, awesome, fantastic. We cant stop praising. Loved food, awesome variety for deserts. True place to taste the Swiss flavors. My personal fav "THE ROSTY" ..superb dish. My wife and i also loved all the deserts. This is surely one reason we will visit Singapore again and again. Just one wish now, Please open any outlet in India. just cant resist the taste
4
We have dined a number of times in Marche, both in 313 and VivoCity. The food, freshly prepared, is simply superb. The ambience is extra-ordinary and its really easy to relax and enjoy the easy-going, casual atmosphere inside the restaurant. My favourite dish is the Rosti with Chicken Sausage while my wife loves the Crepes. The staff is efficient and helpful. So for a great family evening, I would definitely recommend Marche
3
As the previous review, it's a nice place to bring overseas guest for a variety of dinner. My son love to dine here not because of the yummy food. But only because he like their tiny play area, which I felt so smelly and not hygienic. I had had a very yucky and watery vegetable pasta in the 313 Somerset branch once. Their food standard was terrible. After complaining to the manager, they only canceled our bill for the pasta. Went there again last weekend and apparently, the kiddy menu for vegetable pasta turned out much better. The pork knuckle was not as nice as it was before though. And the roast chicken? Well.. I have to say it tasted very plain and standard. The waffles? I prefer Gelare's. This place IS, to me, like a hawker centre (kopitiam) food, but with a twist of 'heidi'and 'spicy' price.
4
simple and quick way to host overseas guests with diverse palettevariety of stalls to tuck in for a decent meal over lunch, brunch or dinner. VivoCity outlet is my fav, although other outlets would provide similar spreadAmbience is good for a quick or simply a chill-out are
4
The location (at the 3rd floor) itself is a great place. This floor at the Vivo city itself is a great place. The variety is huge ..from fruits to salads..pizzas to deserts. We liked the Chicken Sausage (best ever) and the Kampong chicken..rissoto too was good. Over all great location..good food (variety) and well behaved and courteous staff
3
First impression counts as they say, and Marche lives up to that expectation. The restaurant is nicely decorated in a cottage-like manner, though cramped but cosy none otherwise. Imagine the place to be like the seven dwarfs' cottage in Snow White & the Seven Dwarves. Furniture are made of solid teak wood. Lots of decorations hang everywhere.Food choice, everyone usually makes a beeline for the Rosti (a Swiss traditional potato food). one can add a sausage to go along with that, plus a dollop of sour cream on the side. There's a pretty good range of salad choices, pasta, risotto dishes, seafood and meat, all cooked to the diners' preferences. Just get the card which look like a credit card, from the waiter at the entrance and one can start ordering the food. Just present the card, which the chef will swipe in order to register your order. At the end of your entire dining experience, proceed with the card in hand to the Cashier area to make payment. It's that easy! Price range for a couple to dine in is estimated to be around SGD$40-$80 (depending on the type of food one order). Note: Outlets can get pretty crowded during weekends. Waiting time about 10-25mins. Another outlet is at Somerset 313

We went to marche @ vivo last friday, 20 of us we made a booking for lunch.Ok, overall, the food is great, atmosphere is great, location.... great, Price hmm.... u decide yourself (not that cheap)The BIG minus thing that we found out that, after you spent of $30.00 for a single receipt you entitled with 1 free drinks after you pay. yes... after you pay, and the notification is just there right in front of the cashier (small notification which is i'm hardy see), yes, maybe we didn't look or we might have a chit chat with our colleague. but let's see, you should at least offer it to us, as we entitled to it.Second BIG thing is when we order menu of the day, which is the meat (steak) with smashed potato. Let me ask you (marche), are there any different portion between us (asian) and white man (european/american), as those people got 3 big slices and us only 2 small slices?.You are really racist if you think those people can have more by paying the same price with us.I keep a look at the guy who serve it, looking at it... i don't want to create a drama there, as it will be a spoil our lunch time.No problem, smaller piece for us asian, but damn you man, you also asian... serving us. we (customer) paying the same price for the same thing.So hope you can do any STANDARDISATION, we eat at the same place, we pay at the same amount but you differentiate us.Wont be bac

Great playground and i really appreciate the kids colouring sets. But the food is very disappointing. Salads, not fresh and pastas and crepes lack authentic flavour.
3
Wa there in October - had the lunch special - Stuffed Chicken breast - dry, cold in the middle and served with a half raw potato thing - unappetizing - won't be going again...

At non-peak times, the atmosphere is great.
Good variety of European cusine.
Prices are high by local standards, but not by much.
4
Marche is one of the best selection of foods.Must go there with empty stomach.You just name it from starters, main course to desserts they cater all.
4
Lots of options and great decor, but always a little too crowded in this place. More vegetarian options would be good also.
5
A restaurant with freshly squeezed juice for the kid's meal? Yes, it does exist! Marche is a great Swiss chain with two locations in Singapore. 313 Somerset is much larger and has a kid's play area. It is an underground dining area decorated to be a swiss chalet, you have to see it to understand. The vivo city outlet is on the rooftop, pretty, but very warm at lunch because of the sun. Much smaller, no play area. And no toilet!! You have to leave a credit card and the door to use the toilet in the mall. No can, lah! I was alone with my two kids and just had to hold it. They have a few vegetarian options, enough to keep me coming back. Nice salads. Good wine and beer. The kid's meals are great and well priced. Adult entrees are expensive, but you are paying to not have MSG and processed food. I feel it is worth it. Service is average
4
The restaurant layout and design is very refreshing. It's feeling like in oversea!Good quality food, freshing and attractive! But the chef could have more patience and friendly when serving the customers. E.g introduce the best food if possible!Overall is good but the service could have more improvement
5
Every person who enters Marche is given a Marche credit card each.You just get it swiped whenever you are ordering something. So, in spite being a self service place, you are required to take out your wallet only once - when you return the card on exit! The place has a whole farmhouse feel with food stations that serves their specialized course( Pizza, Pasta, Crepes, Vegetables,Rosti, Seafood, Desserts etc.) with variations available. Its a great experience to witness your food being cooked fresh in front of your eyes. The food is great and desserts are sumptuous. Pricing is little on the higher side, say around S$25 for a complete meal (beverage, main course and dessert) but the serving portion makes it worth it. Its recommended that you visit here in a big group, so you can try different options. Be ready for a waiting queue during evenings and weekends. Marche at 313 Somerset is way bigger that one at Vivocity just in case you are contemplating where to go
4
Fuss free style of dining - food is prepared at individual stations before your eyes. You get a card to record all your food purchases. No need to fumble for wallet at each food station. You go to a station - order what you want, charge to this card & pay the total amount at the exit after you are done eating. Always crowded. The attentive staff noticed I had shopping bags and brought an extra chair for me to put my bags. That was very nice of her since it was during dinner time & the tables around me were all taken
4
This restaurant has several branches, my son and daughter-in-law took me to the one near the Somerset subway station. The motif is Swiss and I enjoyed the rosti and also the crepes. The variety of international foods available is wonderful...It does get crowded so best to avoid the lunch hour
4
Came there after work time and it very packed. I even got seat near the toilet.
So many choices at Marche will make you confuse which one to chose. Overall, food was nice & I like the ambience at Marche.
5
Great Pizzas-large, so suggest sharing and topping up with one of their salads, the chicken caser salad is great and come sin a very big bowl. So pizza and salad for two is very filling and also very reasonable price
4
Everything is unique about Marche- Concept, Decor, Food, Location!!!
Slightly expensive but good for occassional dining. Food is good but can take a while for your order to be ready.

As we walked out of Vivo city one night during our holiday at Sentosa Island, we literally stumbled across this wonderful restaurant on the waterfront, Marche. We weren't sure what kind of a place it was at first as it looked a bit like a buffet, so we asked to look around first. We were really impressed by the brightness and beautiful look of the produce as well as wide selection of foods on offer. We decided to try it out and were certainly not disappointed.We had ordered a paella which was simply outstanding, a generous portion and plenty of seafood in a subtle sauce with a little kick. More than enough to share for two, which we promptly followed by a sweet crepe with fresh berries and chocolate sauce. Lovely. Could easily have another one of them, but stopped each other to do so in the spirit of "less is more", and after paying only about SD$33.00?!? Walked out satisfied and ready to come back the following night to try something else (and we did!).For those reviewers who thought it was expensive, I'm not sure what they mean, as where we come from, Australia, we could easily pay at least double for dishes of that size and quality. Yes, we shared both dishes, but how much do you need before you gorge yourself? Totally worth it, prepared in front of you from the freshest ingredients, and as tasty as you can expect from an acclaimed restaurant, Marche was a refreshing and a thoroughly enjoyed experience
4
Known for its freshness, Marche Singapore does not disappoint. With a play area for young kids, it is a popular with families. The crepes - both savoury as well as sweet are simply outstanding. Great salads and fresh juices as well. And being swiss, the meat servings are great as well.Nice even though it is slightly pricey.
2
I've been to Marche many times and the quality has decreased over the years while their prices have increased. I've tried their crepes, pork knuckles, pasta, rosti, mushroom soup, etc. It's really expensive now and for the quality that you get, it's not worth it at all. Would not recommend this place and I will not return anymore
5
Marche is somewhere you must try and has something to cater for everyone as you literally pick whatever you would like from a massive range of fresh ingredients and they cook it there and then for you. I went for calamari and it was really delicious!
2
one of my family favourite place. over the years, food quantity of food seems to be getting smaller. servicing staff not as 'friendly' as it used to be and I simply don't like their tone when they take order from you. if is not because of my kids, we won't purposely walk in
3
The food is alright and can get a little pricy for some of the items. The beef stew is a must try, the downside would be that they don't have it all the time ( in fact most of the time) the savory crepes are pretty good.
3
I find the prices here to be on the higher end, compared to their competitor at Orchard Central. It is also cramped - food stalls on your left & tables on your right meant the walkway was narrow & if there were people walking in the other direction with their piping hot food, you had better be careful. I find their dessert selection very little; their competitor has a much more varied menu & a more colourful one at that. However I like their paella as there was a lot of ingredients thrown in, unlike their competitor, so it makes for a very colourful plate of rice. I ordered roasted chicken crepe & I must say it was tasty, though the serving was too large for me. I also ordered their chicken chowder. At $5.90 for a pathetically small bowl, I must say it was a really expensive bowl of soup. At Marche, most of the patrons belong to the upper middle class. One look & you will know. If you don't like rich people, finish your food quickly & go
4
The food village setting was fantastic, as was the variety of food. There were enough healthy options to keep my family satisfied while I indulged in a variety of meat preparations. Good value for money.
4
Great food, reasonable price, accessable location. Experienced the Swiss way dining and food. A lot of selections of food and a variety of drinks, fresh and ready to eat meals are available. Comfortable dining right in the heart of the city district.
4
I guess what's appetizing in Marche are the breads in front of their resto. It always smell fresh and taste fresh. Highly recommended to try.
4
Very nice place for a weekend brunch.
But I must say, they need to come up with new menus, as they haven't changed since I patronized them back in 2004!
4
This was my 7th visit to Singapore and almost 15th visit to Marche @Vivo City. Everything so fresh and tasty. Though a bit expensive but given the value for money I get, It tempts me to visit again and again.Potato crapes are the best selling dish though I like strawberry crumble cake the most. Veg pasta was really good.A must try for every visito
5
I was missing my home food so went down to Marche over the long weekend.I had been to Marche's before so what I was expecting was exactly what I experienced. The formula is consistent and the formula is wonderful. I filled myself with rosti, salmon, rich chocolate dessert and German wine.Left feeling satisfied 
5
This is one of my personal favorite restaurant in Singapore! I come here several times a year, either with family or friends.My kids like the Rosti with sausage and the cream pasta, my husband would go for a savory crepe and I like the Spanish rice, we like the fried calamari tooDon't remember when was the last time we ordered desserts there as we were usually too full to have dessert.Definitely worth a try. Cost is about $25 + tax per person
5
When you want a really good crepe, some wonderful cream of mushroom soups or delicious rosti and sausage this is just the tip of the iceburg at this gourmet buffet style restaurant. We were never disappointed by the food. Drinks are a bit too pricy for me but that's Singapore!
5
The restaurant has a new and refreshing market concept where you get to select your own ingredients out of the fresh stock piled outside each service counter. You pay with a food credit card provided at the entrance.The place looks green and wonderful and the food is prepared in front of you with your chosen ingredients. We tried mushroom soup, pasta in cream sauce, potato rosti and ice cream and everything was delicious. thumbs up for this one!
5
A friend took me to Marche and I was delighted: visually the place looks wonderful, it has a nice buzz, the self service with swipe card I'd never seen before but loved, and the food - OMG the food was fantastic. Between us we had freshly squeezed juices, rosti, grilled salmon, some Swiss sausage, some apple crumble and some chocolate mousse. Definitely recommended
4
Family weekend outing and decide to have dinner.
Long Q and was crowded,but was attended in order.
Atmosphere...just love it.
Professional & Friendly staff.
Wide selections for foods and done just deliciously and varieties of desserts.......
Must try their pastries & salads,
2
This was my 3rd visit to Marche, I was disappointed. service was mediocre, lack of sauces (no tomato sauce for pizza!). I wouldn't go back to this place again.
5
My family goes here 1-2 times per week. A little pricey (>S$180) but we love the atmosphere and the choice and the staff are highly professional and friendly. Only problem is they always seem to be out of vegetables :-(
4
Nice 'different' vegetarian option for the kids. No spice, no new tastes- familiar fried potato cake with a dollop of yummy sour cream!It is also served with sausage for those who are so inclined. But, for the non veggies- soft shell crabs are my recomendation.
4
Good selection and quality. Charges is reasonable.
4
the breads and fruit tarts very nice, choices of bread also varies, price was fair.
4
My aunt raves about this restaurant everytime she comes to SG for a visit. So after a tiring day in Universal Studios, we headed to March at Vivo city.Upon entering the restaurant, each of us were handed a card(kinda like a charge card).The card will be used to purchase the dishes that you like and will be paid upon exit. Marche is made up of several stations, each stall having tis own specialty. Each station appeared to be very attractive which gave me a hard time deciding which dish to order.Salads, Soups, Breads, Pizzas, Pastas, Sausages, Meat dishes, Drinks, cakes and pastries are available to fill our hungry stomachs. The wide variety of food made us want to try everything. In the end we decided to order from each stall and try at least 1 - 2 dishes per stall. We all love the salad! The Sausage and Rosti match perfectly. The freshly baked pizza disappeared fast from out table. We also liked the crepes so we ordered more. We were wondering why there was a line on the Pork knuckle and figured out why when we tried it. so yummy!All of us enjoyed our dinner at Marche though the food can be a bit pricey. Good thing we were able to avail of 10% discount upon presenting the tourist card we got from Vivo city (you can get tourist discount card at the vivo city information)
4
I love this place, both at Sommerset and Vivo, each has its own uniqueness. Just need to be early to avoid long queue... even during weekdays. It is a perfect place to try different things or if you have a group of friends or for family. There is also a small kids corner at Sommerset to keep the kids entertained
4
I dont know what it is about this restaurant but I like it! Food is fresh and well prepared; deliciously prepared steaks, pasta, pizza, crepe..... Love the desserts. Chefs and staff are friendly. I like variety and they have a whole lot of it. No pressure to pay anyone's meal if you're with friends... my kids love to wander around and order on their own (this can get costly), its like a family meal by the time we all come back with our spoils and dig in. Overall, always a wonderful dining experience but check-out and you will find if you're not careful your bill can run up quite high.
4
I like Mache because of the variety and overall the food is good, it can be very pricey if you try everything there.I love the mushroom soup and stir fried vegetables, every time I am getting it. I wanted to try the pork knuckle but waited for long, they still have replenish, so I chose grill chicken. The grill chicken is nothing fantastic, just as the one you can get outside. Tried the pasta, not my kind of liking.sausage and steak not bad, the crepe tasted good too. I like the dessert area, all seems delicious
3
Food is mediocre just above average but pricey. Save money and enjoy your meals elsewhere.
5
I thought Marche is expensive like $50 because of the nice ambience and food. Well, we were wrong! You can have a big meal at around $13 each.
5
The whole experience of this restaurant was amazing...the food was fresh and cooked in front of us.
Truly: Fresh Healty and Fast!
4
Great comfort food, great variety and fresh ingredients. Just delicious. I always go for rosti and sausages.
2
overpriced and lousy food. Bad western. Don't bother...
4
The food is very good, but not great. I still love eating here for the fun atmosphere and desert crepes.
4
i think the food is good and the way you get your food is very european styled.
3
Marche uses to be a family dinner affair where mum would pamper us kids and let us choose whatever we want at the swipe of a receipt. That was about 10-11 years back perhaps, where they were situated in Heeren and Suntec. I used to look forward to our Marche visits.Managed to find a friend to eat at Marche 311@Somerset, I was quite disappointed. The selections of food was much lesser and they no longer serves oysters... Some details on food displays were not clear, made it rather confusing/difficult to order. Utensils were located at various locations but not filled up regularly. I can't find the same 'Marche feeling' again... Which is why I am unlikely to patronize them again.
3
It's fun to take a group to Marche and taste lots of food. This time we went with friends on the way home from church camp in Indonesia. It's set up so you go to different theme centres to order your food which is prepared fresh and delivered to your table. A lot of variety
3
I like the market-place theme of the restaurant and the various stalls with different types of food. When you place your order at the stall of your choice, you can see them prepare the dish in front of you. You get a card at the counter when you enter, and when you order at each stall, you give them your card for them to record. After your meal, pay at the exit. The food is decent for the price, and the atmosphere makes for a fun outing with friends or family
3
The fun thing about visiting Marche is its kitschy European-themed decor and the novelty of buying your food in a market-place setting. The quality of the food is only average and the prices not low either. But it's good fun.
5
I love it! My friend Irish brought me here for snacks. I loved the ambiance, the food, and the concept itself was something different and unique. We will definitely come back! :)
4
It's is really good, whenever me and my family are near Orchard and have no place to go with go to Marche, I love the smoked salmon crepe and the brownie!
5
i so love this restaurant. ambiance is excellent....food is very excellent
4
Just like Marche in Switzerland. Walk in. Be given a card. Select food and drink and have it put on card. At end pay and walk out.
4
When I went to Singapore my colleagues in Singapore took me to this place. The idea is great. I tasted the smoked salmon crepe and the freshly prepared pasta. The food tasted good and there was something for everybody. Would like to come back to this place when I am in Singapore next time

I used to frequent Marche pretty often sometime ago and have always had good dining experiences. Prior to our Halloween tour at Universal Studios Singapore last Oct, my friend and I decided to have our dinner at Marche VivoCity. IT WAS THE WORST DECISION EVER. I remembered vividly that the hostress, Carol, handed me just ONE spending card. She did not give out the card to my friend. I thought perhaps there was a change in the way you guys operate these days and hence, we did not ask for a second card. After our dinner, we proceeded to make payment at the cashier. I handed over the ONE AND ONLY card we have to the cashier and made the payment. Up until this point, everything was pleasant and we were so ready to head for our Halloween night. But after making my payment, the cashier stopped us and asked for the second card. I can't remember how many times I've regurgitated on the FACT that the hostress only gave us ONE card. One of your service staff, whom I've failed to get the name, was tactless enough to question us infront of ALL the guests at the cashier. She then brought us back to the table where we sat on and started checking the area, completely oblivious of the curious guests around. Carol came but all she could say was 'I remember her but not him' and she went away. Just when I thought this was HUMILIATING enough, she had to ask us to check our pockets and bags with the reason being 'maybe you FORGOT about the card or incidently left it in your pockets' or somewhere along that line. This pocket checking was done infront of ALL the guests around, no surprise there. Having had enough of the humiliations, we offered to open up our bags to let her check but she refused. Instead of, she took down our contact details and particulars. Humilitations aside, she had the cheek to tell us that she would do a tally check by the end of day and if there wasn't any loss of cards, she would not call us. I was expecting an apology call at the least, given the many humiliations she had graced upon me and my friend.Is this the way Marche service staff treat their guests? How can any service person be THIS tactless? I sincerely hope that your management would reflect upon this HORRIBLE experience of mine and honestly do something about it

Marche boosts a wide range of food from the health conscious to those with a sweet tooth. The dishes/booths that stand out the most were the Rosti/Sausage and the crepes/waffles. The rosti is fried till a golden crisp and paired with sausage (with extra cost), sauerkraut and sour cream. I specially like the caramel bananas with crepe and ice cream. If you are hanging out with friends but dont want to limit yourselves with the type of food to eat without going to a foodcourt marche is a good place to head to as it can cater to almost all taste buds, from pizza to steak, beer and salads. Just prepare to pay a little more than your average food court
2
I was pretty disappointed with the falling standards of Marche during my last visit. I used to love the Rosti that they would churn out but it was quite disappointing to be served with an almost "pre-prepared" and nowhere as crisp as it used to be Rosti. The sausage that was served with the rosti too seemed a bit past its sell by date which was very surprising to me. Sorry Marche - but you just lot one of your regulars !
2
I haven't been to Marche for a long time (2 years at least). Previously they were at Suntec City - bigger place with better variety and ambience. Now they are in the basement of 313 Somerset - much smaller place with small variety of food, much of it overpriced although they taste OK. 313 Somerset has tons of better places to eat so don't waste your time at Marche.
5
Nothing like it in the U.S., so I love this place. The food is fresh and mostly healthy, with fresh juices, freshly prepared salads, pizzas, crepes, vegetables (including great mashed potatoes), paella and other items.
4
The prices are not cheap, but the quality of the food is great. There is a great variety of food to choose from and the flavor is great. High quality ingredients.
4
You can eat an eat an eat this place has great food.....an man oh man I love the bread
4
Good variety of Euro style food. Good ambinence and service speed. Can be crowded during lunch/dinner times. Great for tea time or late lunch..
4
come every month and the restruant is consistent a good place for an informal quick bite
5
Fantastic food and quality,
Swiss style farm type selling of food,
Cooked right in front of your eyes.
One of a kind restaurant.
Must visit at least once in a lifetime!!
5
I loved the food, the ambiance and the variety of choices given.
3
I used to love dining at marche and thought I would rekindle the memories during our last visit to Singapore but we were a little disappointed at the selections they had. The pork loin chop my husband ordered was juicy and flavorful but their signature rosti fell flat. It was cold in the middle and not as crispy on the outside as it used to be and I realized it was because each portion was already pre prepared and not as fresh as before. The price you pay is actually for the view from the restaurant and not for the food. Wouldn't mind missing this on our next trip
4
What i loved about this place was the colors, all very fresh and fragrant like a make belief farm market. The food here is very good and a large spread to select from. They have large wooden tables where there is place for everything you ordered. I visited this place couple of times and i like their cream of mushroom, baked potatoes with bits of meat and the desserts. You might want to skip it on sunday's when it gets overcrowded. Honestly more than the food i love the idea of looking n while my food is cooked and yes the colors of course !
4
I took a friend to Marche this week and loved the place. The food presentation is fantastic. The staff are efficient (if a little cold). The taste of the food is excellent (I enjoyed my rosti and salmon).One gripe: Marche is listed on Tripadvisor in the $$ category, but it would be impossible to get out of there buying one main, some vegetables or salad and a drink for under $35 including taxes. Marche: please don't misrepresent yourself and put yourself in the $$$ category 
4
A great spread of european food at reasonable prices.
5
Big tables for large groups, wide choice of food and drinks.
4
Its like a coffeeshop, but classier. Wide range of food, and drinks available. Wide range of prices which ensures something for everyone. Relaxed atmosphere makes it a great meet-up place.
3
Everything seems fine at Marche. You will always get a seat, except for Sundays. The food is not extremely delicious, but it is ok. I suppose the draw to the place is the varieties they have to offer and the billing system which could help you to escape footing for the whole bill when out dining with a big group.Good choice of dining venue when you want to go dutch on everything down to a chopstick
4
Had been here many times, the rustic setting made my girlfriend and i missed our time in switzerland.The nicer dishes are the rosti, crepe, cream of mushrooms n desserts.. Oso served one of e best ice lemon tea. The rest are so-so.Hioe they will serve cheese fondue one day,.
4
Based in one of the newer shopping malls this outlet is seldom quiet and has a queueing system akin to a ride at a theme park with even an express lane for groups.If you don't mind then queueing for food and handing over your smart type account card at each selection counter then the food will be rewarding on the palate. Queueing to pay on the way reminds you that this is not a restuarant, however as long as you know that is the concept you should not be dissapointed
5
Its a lovely swiss restaurant with a swiss village ambience.. each person is given a swipe card and the system is that there are several different counters making different foods and u can choose what u feel like eating and ur card is swiped for that food item which is then given to u in a tray and u can go and eat it. they have amazing rostis, pastas, meats, desserts, juices, salads, etc.in fact it wont matter whether u r a veggie or a non veggie, everyone will find something to eat
4
The nice thing about Marche is that you pay what you eat with the buffet like selection of food - which serves well for a family whose members might like to have different food....Kids love coming here because of the selection of the ice cream and desser
4
We went to the Marche Restaurant on Orchard Road for lunch on two occasions. At first sight, it looks like a bakery, rather than a restaurant since various kinds of breads are displayed at the entrance. The restaurant is one level lower, in the basement. Marche is a Swiss Restaurant chain. There is a variety of food on offer. Hand pressed fresh water melon, apple and orange juices are absolutely delightful. We tried one of each!! They have lemonades in different flavours as well. Their hash browns are a must have. The restaurant did not disappoint our vegetarian palates as they had decent vegetarian options for us to pick from. We tried the mushroom soup which was wholesome and delicious along with a selection of breads. The salad counter was a buffet in itself. We could rustle up our own salad in small, medium or large bowls. The vegetarian pizza was really good and the veg pasta ok. The veg and mushroom crepes were tasty as well. The desserts were absolutely amazing. We gorged on the sumptuous Apple Pie which my 12 year old daughter fell for after the very first bite!!The restaurant is always full and buzzing. The tables are closely set and therefore a bit crowded. The waitresses are dressed in Swiss costumes and an old 19th century sledge along with wooden wall finishing is supposed to give it a Swiss feel. Set in the basement, the restaurant has no natural light, so has to be artificially lit all the time.It is a family friendly restaurant, which has something for everyone - adults and children, vegetarians and non vegetarians. I liked the concept of "Pay for what you eat buffet". There is a huge spread, but you only need to pay for what you eat. Try it out once at least, when in Singapore
5
this place is at 313@Somerset at Orchard. Lovely place. Awesome concept of a swiss market place. Definately try their fresh juices and smoothies! The rostee is amazing!! lots of options of vegetarians...their thin crust pizza is yummy! They have a very tempting dessert section. A must try when visiting singapore!!
5
my first ever encounter with an authentic swiss food and what a place to have this..an authentic swiss restaurant !! the ambience was breathtaking , the method of card swiping ...fantastic.. my recommendation : swiss dosti with sour cream !!
5
This is one of my favourite eateries in Singapore. The variety is great with all fresh stuff. Pricey but you pay for the quality
5
I loved Marce' restaurant, the lay out was great! The set up was like a swiss market, loved the food as it was made fresh. Definately worth the money :)
1
i've been to marche numerous times. the place offer inconsistent quality of food, and their staff are terrible. they abide by their 'no food bought from outside must be brought in' so strictly that we were told to leave our grocery outside the restaurant. we couldn't even give the child in the group a piece of chocolate. the food is expensive by standards, and the taste can vary according to chefs. i've since stopped going to the place, unless friends ask me to.
3
Food is good., just normal good. I like the sweet crepe cause I have a sweet tooth. The variety of food is getting lesser. Disappointed,I guess from Heeren to Suntec and now at VIVO City, the place has shrunk so much that you can hardly move around when the resturant is full. But now with one more outlet at Orchard, I think it is slightly better. Still Singapore have space constraint, so we will just have to make do with it then. :
5
Marche is a Swiss style restaurant set on the upper floor of Vivo City. For the uninitiated you are handed a credit card on entry and shown to a table. With the card you then browse the restaurant deciding what you would like to eat, the selection is varied and excellent quality. Fresh baked bread, salad bar, wine/beer bar, Italian pizza's, grilled food, crepes' - you won't go hungry. When you have decided you hand over your card and the server will activate the price of the item. At the end of your meal you pay for everything you have had as itemised on your card. Good value by Singaporean standards, very popular (we had to wait for 10 minutes to be seated) not just by tourists but also by locals for the high quality food. The décor is Alpine Swiss with cable cars, skis and wooden chalets - very bizarre when outside the temperature is 30 degrees +. Great place to eat.
1
I have been going to Marche almost every month for last 2 years, and i like their food. but today, when i asked for a glass of water, tap water, They refused to serve it to me. Now, normally i would have just walked away, but most of the staff know me well, and the person had the audacity to lie, that the tap is broken. I went over, and turned the tap, and water flowed. Then, talking to manager, the manager offered me a glass of tap water, out of all his generousity. I refused to take it, and asked him why they would refuse people a glass a water, when they have spent more than 30 bucks per head for breakfast. He made excuses, saying the employee did not know good english. They would not admit, what they did was wrong, and I am very disappointed at that. I will now continue to bad mouth the place, tell all my friends to avoid it, despite the good food. With Singapore in general, the restaurants do not realise that we, as customers pay their salaries, when we eat in their restaurants. They overcharge, give bad service, and think we need to be grateful for them having served us. Extremely irritating. Never again
3
Poor service at the entrance, very snooty guest relations. Despite the available tables inside, they only insist on getting the information of the people who have actually stepped in the restaurant. Instead of how restaurants like Din Tai Fung or Medzs (a similar styled resto though this time featuring Mediterranean food) manage their queues, their wait staff insist on it their way, which seems pretty arrogant. Upon entering the restaurant (about 30 - 45 minutes after), though, the atmosphere sort of made up for the long wait; it was pretty good, with several trees, well spaced numerous tables, good appropriate lighting, all with several food sections with different specialties whose orders can be swiped into plastic cards issued per person. Theres a section for the ROSTI, a potato dish that looks like shredded potato (hash browns), that's crispy on top and soft underneath, with sour cream on the side and several options for the viand. Various Sausages, mushrooms, etc. Then there's some beef, chicken and pork in another section; and there's seafood, drinks, beer or even pastry in other areas. Tried the ribeye (well cooked despite the tough cartilage in the middle, pork knuckles which were crispy, pizza (margherita) and salad. They were fine though a tad pricey (between 14 to 20 sing dollars). The dessert was banana crepe which was a bit dry and with too huge chunks for bananas. The ambience was great for lengthy chit chat afterwards so that made up for the less than stellar food. I say the place is good if you wanna hang out, but not for dinner per se. If you want similar style resto but better food, go to Medzs at Orchard Paragon basement.
4
Set up like a food court in a theme park (think Swiss chalet), Marché is a pretty good place to stop and fill up while doing that thing you do in Singapore... shopping! Lots of northern European standards (pork knuckle, Rösti, crêpes, sausages etc.), with a Swiss and German leaning. Also more Mediterranean stuff like paella, pastas and grilled meats. We tried the Black Forest Ham Crêpe which was delish and great value. German draught beer (I had a Warsteiner Dunkel) makes it even better.Worth a try

This restaurant on the uppermost storey of a mall just off the Harbour Front has the usual 'artisanal' touch to it, thoiugh the 'farm' objects make it more tacky than authentic. Plastic cows are statiioned outside the restaurant and a goat and lambs at ceiling level move even as guests enjoy thier meal below! Service is quick and efficient. The restaurant has a wide array of cooking stations from which guests can choose the food and drink they prefer and get charged for it on the cards given to each guest. As the food is made right in front of the guests, all of it is fresh and good. The fruit juices are definitely worth trying. As there is a whole range to choose from, visitors with a good appetite alone can likely try more than 3-4 courses among the whole range available Prices are a bit steep as compared to what in on offer, but that may be the premium required to create a yesteryear artisanal marketplace for a restaurant

Not a first time dining here, and the whole ambiance and food are nice and of good quality. Perhaps, the only drawback is, that compared to numerous other places of similar quality food we found Marche bit too expensive.

I loved the location and the atmosphere.(Vivo City) But most of all I loved the food, lots of variety and great taste. I will definitely be back.

This place wasn't very intuitive, there's know 'how-to' and you're expected to know how it works. Each station is separate, each dish is individually priced, you give them the card you receive on entry and they 'charge' what you eat to the card and you pay on exiting the restaurant. Hubby and I tried 3 main dishes, a chicken and pasta gratin, a chicken and red onion pizza and the swiss rosti (a hash brown type dish with sausage). My favourite was the pasta gratin, the pizza had no tomato sauce, just slices of tomato (and I hate tomato!) and the rosti was more mushy than crispy hash brown (plus the sausage we got was dry and tough as leather!!) Not to mention, portion sizes are TINY! We paid S$14.50 for a 'side plate' sized pizza that didn't have much topping on it and the base was pretty soggy. I think next time we'd change our meal choices! What got this place an extra star (I'd have given it 3 otherwise) was the Crepe of the week (banana and chocolate) which we had for dessert - DIVINE!!

Dining at Marche was a welcome reprieve after spending hours in the heat and humidity at Universal Studios. It was the second time I've eaten herem, the first being years ago in Somerset. Most dishes were prepared onsite using fresh ingredients. I particularly enjoyed the Swiss Rosti and the veggies. I didn't quite find the Spanish Paella authentic though but it was nevertheless delicious. Had the Apple was a bit disappointing. Ambiance was cozy and service was casual. Don't forget the sweet and sour candies when you check out

We dined at the Vivo store several times as we were staying on Sentosa Island and were at Vivo regularly. The only other place I have been to like this was Rosenbergers in Vienna. We loved this place. I am gluten intolerant so dining here made it easy for me as things were prepared fresh in front of me and I knew exactly what I was eating. The fresh juice was lovely, we had rosti, which was great! I also had paella which was delicious and a whole selection of fresh vegetables and salad.When it gets busy it's a bit noisy and having no toilet in the restaurant were the only down sides.Great to go to with kids but my husband and I loved it on our own. Also dined at the Orchard store but liked this one better, not as much choice as it's smaller but we liked it

Right from the moment we entered, we knew we had come to the right place. The ambience and the aroma of the food was simply intoxicating. Very imaginatively segregated, the drinks, food and dessert counters were brimming with quality ingredients. Most of them were live and the chefs were producing delightfully tasty dishes on demand. There was something for each of us and we were in the age groups of 20 to 50. We ate to our heart's content and yet the per head cost was only around US 25. To my mind a visit to this place is as important as visiting the Sentosa island and Universal Studios (both of which were not on our itinerary this time any way)!!

Choose your food, get it straight away, lots of fun especially for kids. Everything we ate was fresh and yummy. It was packed and lots of swiss guys running around. It's not Michelin star but really good place to know about. Go outside and paddle in the Vivo City pool thing. Their Christmas tree has to be seen to be believed (Vivo City

Styled with the ambience of a Swiss fresh food market complete with stalls for tons of delish and a very wide selection of food,this is a good place to go to.Must try? everything! I loved the salad bar and the paella, the fresh fruit juice and the soup stations.The concept of swiping a card to keep track of what you consumed is nice too.A definite must go-back to place

Vivo City Branch - I like the concept - lots of small nicely laid out stalls selling a variety of foods so each guest can wander around and select what they like. I tried the pork knuckle and mashed potatoes. They were good, but the crepes were excellent

Amazing Concept... Great food... Extremely fresh... The Restaurant: Marche was suggested to me by my friend since i was looking for vegetarian food in Singapore.. Marche has great variety for vegetarians (like me), which is NOT Indian... The Food: The Food is cooked fresh in front of you so its not re-heated & you know the chef is not spitting in your food :). they have everything from fresh salads to crepes to Rosti to thick soups, handmade pastas, Pizza and rotisserie chicken and meats grilled on applewood-fed flames YUMMMMMMThe Ambiance: the entire restaurant looks like a Swiss market. Its done up really nicely, with cows, sheep & hens all over the place (obviously NOT real).Its a fun place, not a place for your first date but a great place to hang out with your friends.I managed to take a couple of pictures (though not allowed to ;))Average meal for 2 would cost SGD 5

Unlike other Marche, vegetables here are not cooked upon order but pre cooked and self service. Left them cold.

i tried the steak...not really that much to rave for. the slice is a bit thin. but i'm sure there are other nice things to eat in there. like the interiors of the restaurant though. quaint and lots of choices for just about anything.

We loved the old orchard road branch, but the vivocity outlet has much less variety and the chefs seem to not know much about their preparations - my spaghetti chef couldn't answer simple questions about the accompaniments and taste. The pasta didn't taste great either.The crepes are excellent, as usual, but for the price we paid, I don't think we're visiting again
