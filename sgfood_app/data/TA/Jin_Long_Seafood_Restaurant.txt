Jin Long Seafood Restaurant does special food in their wide selection. Good taste though the price is on the high side

This is the 3rd visit and having 8 course dinner. Will said that the course is above average and it was yummy. The only feedback is that the foods are oily due to deep fired. The desert is just average.

Recently had a family dinner here . The food was lovely .
Staff weren't very friendly or helpful though . The fish and prawns were great as was the duck .

Unexpectedly very delicious... The signature specialities are definitely worth trying. Been here twice already in 2 months. Will be sure to come back...

89 year old Dad birthday, 38 pax enjoyed this gathering here.We had a Cantonese Hongkong style Basin of seafood platter as a main.6 other simple dishes to compliment filling up the stomach.Ended up paying S$1,900 for just the 3 tables.The maids table of 7 were separately charged.For being a regular patron to eateries(every bi-weekly we enjoy different type of food at different restaurants except whilst we are outstation), this is an expensive experience

Extremely slow service. We were seated for at least 10 mins and told 3 person to take our order but they kept telling us to wait. We ordered their signature crispy duck, fried egg plant with long beans, tofu, chilli crab and creamy crab, cereal prawn etc.Chilli crab and creamy sauce crab is just normal. Fried egg plant with long beans was nice. Crispy duck is worth order and need to be eaten while it's hot. Price is expensive. Over rated food.

The good at Jin Long was good, hearty and wholesome. The dishes of spare ribs, steamed fish and fried beans & brinjals were good recommendations. The other dishes we had were venison, wasabi prawns and tofu with mushrooms - all enjoyable. Service was a bit slow as the restaurant was crowded but the service staff were attentive and continually filled our glasses of water. It's good value for money and we will return to try their other dishes.

Recommended by a friend I was hesitant to try seafood cuisine apart from my favourites like jumbo, kheng luck, long Beach, red house.. But surprising the sharks find was substantial, pepper Crab was very good, you tiao/Crab meat and especially the orh-nee was perfect (just the way the experts make it). Well done!

7 of us had lunch.The dishes that we ordered were tabled reasonably fast and hot.However, taste-wise, there was nothing exceptional.Most servings lacked panache - drowning in lackadaisical culinary averageness. Flavours lack identity and should have been more robust.The yam paste dessert was short on sweetness. The fish dish lacked character and could have done better with a tad more ginger slices.At the other extreme, the salted egg prawn dish was overwhelmed by the salted egg powder that ensconced the balled shelled prawn.Only the sweet 'n sour pork item and the deep fried egg plant fingers ( with french beans) seem to pass muster.Service is best described as being 'insouciant' - acceptable... but just barely so.Patronage was poor when we dined. The restaurant had many tables empty, inside the airconditioned diner and outside. A showcase of hard liquor suggests that Johnny Walker wisdom... and the like, prevail on the premises.The establishment need to get their culinary act together. "So-so" food is not likely to pull in the crowds
