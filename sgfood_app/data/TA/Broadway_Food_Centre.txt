Huge selection of local and Asian dishes from many hawkers stalls. This is a cheap place to eat but that doesn't mean that it isn't good. Well prepared and tasty dishes make this place a must try if you're in the area.

This was one of my favourite hawker centres. Clean, small, and a great lot of food options. Try the small Vietnamese place in the centre. great flavour and great quality.

The family & I have ate at Broadway Food Centre several times. We have tried many of the stalls such as the chicken rice, Japan food, Indian food and a few other but have not tried the Vietnam stall yet. Seating inside is not that good as with many food courts. There is some outside seating that is better. The drinks stall staff have every time been very rude, very crude, and super crass. The owners / managers of this food court really need to get better people to serve the drinks. They are the biggest downside and while the food stalls are all good and provide decent service. We will go back again and try more types of food there but we just might buy drinks across the street to avoid the nasty drink stall staff

Not only was I denied service by the lady sitting in the beverage stall, but was also misbehaved to. She unnecessarily snapped saying things like " Why are you here? I don't know you. Why are you here?" While people at other stalls were all very cordial and friendly, but it was due to this rude lady's behavior, I decide NEVER to return back to broadway till the rest of my stay. I haven't seen any intolerance toward tourists in Singapore, hence it's all even more baffling as to what made her snap
