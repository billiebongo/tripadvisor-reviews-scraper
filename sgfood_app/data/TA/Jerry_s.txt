Staff and service were great. Food was excellent and definitely true to name of bbq. Ribs were succenlent and pulled pork had the best smokey auroma ever

Food was slightly pricey for the half slab ribs and the quesadilla. Service and ambience was alright but location is quite a distance away from the trains/buses.

We frequent this restaurant whenever we feel like some good old American BBQ fare. Buffalo wings are a must try (level 2 spicy recommended if u are looking for a tinge of spiciness but not overdoing it).

Excellent service although there's only one staff running the bar she did a great job she attentively attend to our needs and request

It was easy to chope Jerry. The staff members at Jerry's were helpful. Enjoyed Jerry's BBQ chicken and beer offer.

Guys, the wings are great. but the star of the show is the succulent and fall-off-the bone ribs! One of the best places that i have tried in regards to BBQ ribs. A MUST try

My first time visiting this place, the food is good and the portion is really huge. Stuff is polite too, love the pudding cake! Definitely must try

Continuing the hunt for great BBQ pork ribs but disappointed again.
Their tasty and tender oxtail saved the day though.
Very pricey items on menu.

Rocked up on a late Emirates flight and staying just around the corner from club street at the Scarlet hotel, wandered out at 11.30 looking for food. Stumbled upon Jerry’s and got a last food order in before they stop taking orders at midnight. The full rack of ribs were awesome and easily enough for two. A couple of cold tiger ‘mugs’ of draft beer and some crunchy nachos and enough was enough. Time for bed! What a rocking street full of people enjoying a Friday night out. Thanks especially to the wonderfully smiley sole member of staff who worked so hard! Well done.

Lamb loins were great. Other than that the food was okay. Potato boats underseasoned, mashed potato sides contained beef in the sauce but there were no warnings whatsoever. Staff sounded unsure about what was in their dishes, which was strange because they were hedging a lot when they could have just gone to check with the kitchen staff if they weren't sure. Not to-die-for, but overall an okay experience

Ordered half ribs, beef burger, fish and chips and buffalo wings. They were all great except for the burger which was just average.

Very convenient location at boat quay. Lots of people drinking after work. Dinner is nice too. Had lamb chop w roasted potatoes and vegetables.

Lovely eatery situated in a lovely place. We loved the chillness of the area. Service provided was excellent and food was great! We ordered the ribs, triple platter and the popular grilled chicken wings. We thoroughly enjoyed ourselves, highly recommended! :)

Food was generally decent, but their ribs were slightly a bit more tough maybe cause it's overcooked. The handburger that we ordered had great seasoning but would suggest that they cooked it to 80% for the petty.

Used to go as a child and it's still as good as I recall. Shows how long it's been around and standard has remained. Wings are definitely a feature and the ribs always tasty.

Restaurant had an incredibly cosy theme- old school country/home style. The menu serves an extensive selection of ribs, steaks and fantastic sides. Tried half slab of ribs and they were superb!
5
Casual American dining , they are famous for their fiery wingsThe wings weren't that spectacular for me but I think their regular fare deserves lots of credit Ribeye steak was very affordable, cooked perfectly n came with generous portions of veg n fries. Impressed with the simple al dente veg - surprisingly one of the best I hv even eaten . Added a portobello side n perfect!Service is charming - they remember names of customers and it's a cozy plac

Dated and antiquated interior and setting and menu. Reserved a table on a Friday night in view of some food promotion. The whole street was packed except for this restaurant with many empty tables. Food was almost subpar. Edible, for sure, but certainly not at that price point when I could get the same dish at 1/3 the price in a food court. Probably the only decent (aka average) was the service. Definitely not returning.

The BBQ baby back ribs were good. The wings as an appetizer were more than plenty but a little heavy on the sauce (my preference is more dry). The cheese sticks felt like they were from a package and not worth mentioning.The service was good and the value was fine also for Singapore.
5
will go to this place once in a while when I have craving for some good american food, and when i am hungry and I know i wouldnt go wrong with this restaurant menu. have tried the quesadilla (both chicken and pulled pork), prime ribs, pulled pork burger, nachos, buffalo chicken wings, salad, apple pie, tiramisu...... to be honest everything is really good there..... if you want me to choose one thing that i really like, its the quesadilla with pulled pork and buffalo chicken wings. food comes fast too and service is good

This legacy restaurant has been around for a long time and with the 50% discount deal I think it was very worth going again.
5
visited the restaurant through Chope reservations promotion one for one ribs.
The ribs is very tender and delicious.
4
Food was good. Enjoyed 1-for-1 signature ribs thanks to booking via chope! The place was nice and quiet. Though not much crowd at all but the food still took awhile to come.
5
A cosy little pub/restaurant with great service! Food portion is rather large and ribs were tasty! Will definitely be back!
2
The food is way below average. Where the nachos were still ok the steak and ribs were not good at all. The only positive point is the friendly waitress. Won't return, there are a lot better places around.
5
The food, service and ambience was excellent! Conveniently located at Club St, in Chinatown area. Will be back if there are promotions. attractive.

Worth a try, ONE TIME.
Super spicy, I felt dizzy and my ears were burning and they even popped. Went with friends and thoroughly enjoyed the experience even though my body's not going to thank me later for it.

2 x half slab ribs & pulled pork; comes with standard blanched veggies & your choice of sides - we had one of each (fries, potato salad, baked beans). The veggies & sides were nothing special; meat was not bad. The reason why we ordered 2 half slabs instead of just 1 full slab is because there is a promotion until 1st June 2017-- make a booking via Chope & use the promotion code 141RIBS to get 1-for-1 ribs. My only gripe is that the waitress said that it is "clearly stated" that only half slabs (not full ones) can be redeemed.What they DID state clearly in the app is that this offer can only be redeemed once per bill. So it's literally 1-for-1, never 2-for-2 or 3-for-3

Great for a group of girlfriends who want to have strong drinks, laugh loudly, and chow down on satisfying grub. Service was decent and venue was unpretentious. A great alternative to the overpacked meat-market that is some of the venues on club street. Granted we were there on a weekday...I expect the place to be packed on weekends. Highly recommend the ribs, and the super spicy wings

Perhaps the most satisfying (in terms of portion) place in Club Street to get a full meal. Nachos are really good but need to be eaten quickly before the chips gets soggy or soften. Spicy buffalo wings are quite nice and you get to choose level of spiciness. Washed them off with Tiger Radler if you like sweet local beer
