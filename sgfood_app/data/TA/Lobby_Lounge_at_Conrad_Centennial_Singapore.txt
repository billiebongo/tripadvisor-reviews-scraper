Need to take a breath and hangout for while, the Lobby lounge is a good place to be. It is quiet and the menu is good.
5
Love the ambience and the service by the staff .... I would recommend this if u don’t like crowded restaurant
5
Great place to chill out at the centre of the town, great Gin and nice ambiance!! Highly recommend for friends gathering!

Nice soothing ambience. Service was wonderful. Food was just nice, not too much variety but enough to fill up and last till end of the day.

The lobby lounge at Conrad needs to improve the variety of food selection for high tea during weekends. The Gin tonic cocktail is a plus! It's a quiet and nice ambience to catch up with friends.

Was at the Conrad Lobby Lounge on New Year's day for their high tea. For New Year Day it was $60++ per pax with free flow of coffee, tea & soft drinks plus a glass of champagne thrown in! Nice decor and a warm and cozy ambiance. The service was very good especially from their manager, Mr Razali. There was not a lot of variety but the food offered were very good especially their fresh and succulent oysters! I also personally liked their turkey, pork belly and their cakes. The coffees was good but the couple of herbal teas that I sipped from my friends' were really very aromatic and nice.Overall a very nice and relaxing place to spend your afternoons with friends and family. Couples would also enjoy the atmosphere there. I would strongly recommend you try and visit.

It was three years since we held our ROM high-tea wedding reception here and it was an honor for us to be back here to celebrate. The festive weekday afternoon tea set comprised of decadent selection of savoury mini sandwiches and delectable desserts.There were changes from the tea serving this time:1. Ronnefeldt teas are still served, as long as you want, but cannot be changed as often as you want unlike they used to. 2. There were no spread of chocolate pralines and cookies unlike before.3. There were no scones, clotted cream, jams, honey and tea sugar served which are essential components in an afternoon tea.Nevertheless, the experience was still subtle and we will never stop from coming back. Weâ€™ll be waiting for the mew offers after the renovation is finished. Great job

My friend and I went down to Conrad Singapore for their Gin Block Party and tried a few of their gin concoctions. The Taste of the Med which they concocted in conjunction with the Gin Jubilee is good and flavourful. I also enjoyed their Ford's Dry Gin with its clean taste. The food was rather good, be sure to try their laksa or char kway tiao if you have the appetite for a heavy local dinner. If not, you can always order their satays (grilled meat on skewers) and meat buns to go with your drinks

I went to the lobby lounge on a Wednesday evening for dinner, and possibly some drinks together with a date. The place was more packed than we expected upon arrival, and we were surprised that the lounge is smaller than we thought. We had Fish and Chips, and Carbonara from the main menu. The food was delicious, although the waiting time was pretty long. The service staff informed us that there would be a pianist performing live from 830 pm onwards, but we did not stay until that late for it. The place was getting more crowded, so we left for another place to have our drinks.Overall, the service team who attended to us were attentive and courteous. We enjoyed the experience and would revisit the place on a less busy day
4
Having stayed at the Conrad in Singapore we had breakfast here and it was very good. Choice is super. Get your eggs cooked anyway you like as you order. Busy, particularly at weekends, less so weekdays.
4
Venue is still good. But they got my reservation mixed up this time. So it was not a seamless experience. The dim sum selection was better the previous time. But still a good experience overall.
4
Very good value for money. Comfortable seating and nicely spaced layout. Small scale afternoon tea buffet which was perfect for us - pleasant and relaxing.
4
Quality of food although choices of food is not much. Seafood is fresh. Also, unlimited selection of tea and coffee. The staff are poilte. Most important, the ambience is good. Will visit again.
5
Greaf Food.. Great Service! Will be back again. Third time there. Never a disappointment. Staff were warm and friendly.
5
perfect way to end the week with the gin and tonic and the satay was good as ever, pls have it on the nomral menu too.
5
If u think only dingy coffee shops sell mouth watering mutton rendang there's an equally tasty but more elegant version being served at conrad.
5
This was a big plus for the Hotel particularly for my Husband and friends with the Gin Bar! This was very novel as you could choose your Gin by make, then choose your mixer, your bitters and garnish. The area is cool and tranquil and is beautifully decorated with Orchids. I was even served a cocktail with an Orchid decoration. The staff were very friendly. The only thing we found slightly annoying was the closing time, but this is not the Lounge's fault, but Singapore laws! We ate there a couple of times and the food was really good and was good value
5
 Not bad at all. The buffet spread included cold prawns, oysters, mussels, roast duck, Laksa, chicken Siew Mai, glutinous rice, vegetarian spring rolls, samosas, Chinese carrot cake, Fish in a cream sauce, fried rice, a selection of four types of sandwiches, three types of cheese, some fresh fruits, four flavors of ice cream etc. etc. You get teas, coffees and a glass of G n T. Good service. Esp by Amylene and Irene from Korea. I'm not sure if I've remembered names correctly. Overall, I really can't complain at all. Surprisingly different from my experience at Oscar's in Dec 2016. It was a birthday celebration. However, THAT buffet dinner was so miserable that i actually went home hungry. Same hotel, but things can be so different. So, we need to do up to date research and choose carefully.
5
If your not worried about cost and want a place to just relax and enjoy a drink or snack than this place has a the right atmosphere and tastes to please most travelers visiting Singapore and need a place to relax and cool down from the heat of Singapore. There are many such places to choose from in this city and this is just one of them
4
Wide selection of tea, 3 tier non refillable food. 2 tiers sweet, 1 tier savoury. The sweet tiers were nice! 3rd time visiting...
5
High tea was amazing with a great variety of Asian, Italian and Seafood to choose from.
The dessert room was fabulous. Definitely value for money. Would definitely be going back again.
4
Lobby lounge had recently introduced 50% gin and tonic nights on fri. The atmosphere is terrific! Nice
5
if the table are bigger will be good
Kiind of stras as we have to take a small plate else squeezy.
Overall the pricing is just nice as
It comes with a glass of Gin& Tonic-something special
4
Conrad lobby lounge is one that my hubby and I frequently visit because of it's good service and option to select food choices from the oscar restaurant's menu. Atmosphere is always good.
4
Wonderful setvice and good rate for weekend High tea.
Good to service Gin and Tonic as a complimentary drink
3
Ambience is nice and quiet on a weekday afternoon.
Service is average. Choice of tea is average.
Nothing special here.
3
Had a relax Sunday weekend high tea with hubby n son.Good ambience with live piano is great.Service generally is alright, however there is room for improvement. Especially male staff need to be more attentive n efficient. Choice of food should be wider. After first round of hot main food, don't know what to eat next. Hope to see more main dishes. Great to have complimentary Gin tonic
4
A specialist gin menu full of tasty exploration. Staff who are happy to advise (I like the sound of this tonic, what gin/bitters/garnish go best?) - but unfortunately a little hard to find at times. Expensive normally, particularly when you have to add tax and service on top, happy hour makes experimenting yummy and cheaper
5
Enjoyed a great Valentine's Day buffet at the Conrad lobby lounge. Great value for money for the spread of food, live entertainment, overall ambiance and wonderful service of the staff and attention by the chef as well as the hotel management. The food quality was excellent and we were seated very comfortably on the big chairs, together with our friends in the lobby lounge, yet almost having the feeling we had full privacy. Everyone got a small little Valentine's Day token as a nice gesture as well. It all made for a great experience and desire to come back soon
4
Service were excellence and ambiance is great. Variety of food can be improve on. Overall experience is good and will visit again.
3
The lobby cafe is a good quiet cozy place for business discussion. Service is good and served good lunch. Great idea and location for an informal discussion.
4
Nice environment for a chatty session with mine families. Most important they provide excellent service and attend to our needs. Hopefully they can increase the variety of food. Will definite come back again
4
there's a wide variety of food to be chosen, eastern or western.
The scramble egg is the best! Just try it!
4
Never expect to make reservation for a restaurant is such a breeze with Chope. Popular eating places normally need few days advance booking but with Chope, confirmation is instant!
3
The food selection is minimal and it is not worth if not for the 1 for 1 price. There was also no oysters as shown on some food blogs.
5
Wide variety of foods, Sushi, Chinese, Asian etc.,
I stayed at Executive floor but I prefer this restaurant than Exec. lounge.
4
Nice, ambience. Food selection quite good with nice oysters, sushi and cheese platters and local food. Tea and coffee selection quite wide range. The only thing us, they forgot to serve the scones until when we were about to leave so no chance to tadte it. Otherwuse goid value for money.
3
Service was excellent. Ambience was great too. In particular we enjoyed the live piano music. Food was generally fine. However for the item roast beef, based on our previous check, roast beef is served on Saturdays, replaced by a fish item on Sundays. As we do not take beef we were disappointed. While we accept that there can be a change without notice, perhaps for certain items it would be better to avoid changes. Changes to for example the types of cakes or sandwiches is fine
4
Our stay at the Conrad included Executive lounge access, however on our last night the loung was full, so we were redirected to the Lobby Lounge. We felt a bit short changed at first, but in fact it turned out to be great! We had a couple of glasses of Chandon sparking cuvee (included in our room price) and some tasty dim sums and satays (also inclusive). The free drinks stopped at 8pm and we decided to have a cocktail to celebrate the end of our stay in Singapore, flying out the next morning. They were the best gin and tonics we have ever had! You might wonder what could make a G and T so special; I suggest you go there are try to find out. Suffice to say there were three variations, and the two we chose were interesting and very tasty. At one level it is just another hotel lobby, but this made it special
4
Went for a night drinks in the lobby with my wife. It was a lovely place with somebody playing the piano and singing.
3
"Old reliable" Conrad food that won't disappoint if too lazy to leave the hotel to get some eats. In a famous foodie place like Singapore, its still best to visit the hawkers.
5
You arę feeling like in the big and modern world ! Made with style and good taste ! And nice cool atmspghere greets from escape from the heat

Ironically, the service crew had a better standard of service in comparison to the Managers. Having well knowledge of the fully-booked buffet sessions, a proper queue system should have been in place. Whilst the atmosphere was cosy and peaceful, it seemed to backfire when the service staff chose to speak loudly about the inability to change seats (beginning of buffet), and their need to clear the tables for the next seating (end of buffet). One would have expected Conrad to better master the art of subtlety to their guests

We were there to celebrate my mother's father but left the restaurant utterly disappointed and a sour taste in our mouths. 1. Poor Service StandardsWhile a number of wait staffs were "approachable" (read: not even friendly), there were a number of them whom I did not once see a smile on their face. I was quite certain I was there for the food but seeing such cold and unfriendly faces sours the mood and appetite. Note that this is not a request for you to fire unfriendly staff, but at least have the Training & Development department remind them to wear a smile on their faces. On the drinks - I had to wait 20 minutes or more for my drink order to be served and the wait staff had to be chased for before coming back with the drink. I felt that they could have also accommodated to our request for iced beverages. Question: What is the difference if I had asked for a cup of ice for me to pour my beverage into? Answer: Self-service. 2. Lack of foodThere were a number of occassions when food was not replenished promptly. Here's a list of them:a. Shave Roast BeefI probably only had one pathetic portion of shaved roast beef served by the chef over the counter and that was it. Other family members either had only 1 portion or none at all. Worse still, my mother (celebrating her birthday) did not get a chance at it. When approached, the chef swiftly rebuffed her that there's none left and pointed her towards the stir-fried beef instead - which has been left cold. We went by the counter much later and found a plate with several slices of sirloin steak. Beggars can't be choosers aye? Yes, I felt like one. b. Salmon sushiI never saw the daylights of it actually until one of family members told me about it. When a chef was approached for it, I was told that it was on request - which was perfectly fine. I replied that I would like to have 4 plates of it (this would be 8 pieces of the sushi by the way). He checked with another chef who came back with 2 plates. When prompted, she replied that it was all that is left. 4 slices of salmon and that was it, which I am very certain made up less than a quarter of a salmon fillet found in the supermarket. Even my typical grocer carries more stockpile of salmon than that! c. Dessert counterThis was just a mish-mash of different desserts that was served at that counter. Some even did not even have food labels attached to it.d. Ice-cream counterWhen it was finally time for desserts, I went straight for the ice-cream. Perhaps it might have been a saving grace for a dismal afternoon at the hotel only to be further disappointed. 3 different selections to choose from, BUT, there was hardly any left. Later on, I was told by one of my family members that the ice cream had ran out!? 3. Poor food quality & varietya. Cold roast beefWhen I did get a portion of the roast beef, it was cold to the touch. Note, this is not room temperature cold but refrigerated cold. My sister's boyfriend also had a similar experience on the day as well. Which begs the question if the establishment is indeed making attempts to control the amount of food being served at a buffet?b. Chocolate fondue, or chocolate lumps??Self-explanatory actually. I took a picture of the disgusting sight. c. Cold cooked prawnsHad a couple of pieces, which I felt was not fresh, at all. d. Food choicesBy far the worst selection of food choices for a buffet. I've been to a number of high-teas and high-tea buffets but have never been met with such scarcity. You should totally skip this, and probably the hotel as well since they would repeat the same service standards. I would have given it 0 starts if I could
3
Just been to this place for high tea.Place is disorderly as there is no enough space to move around .There is no counter at the entrance where u can go and confirm reservation .It is harder to get waitress to check with u whether u made reservation becos they are very busy.There are wide variety of food but space between food stations and patron tables are very narrow. I had to move thru gap of patron seat to and fro.  They should learn from Scot 10 of Grand Hyatt
3
We came here to try the high tea buffet as there is a 1-for-1 credit card promotion.Food was average overall as there were hits (the beef live station and fresh seafood) and misses (the snapper was cold and the pork belly a little tough).Mr Razali was quite charming though
3
I always come here for their Chocolate Royal Hazelnut Crunch. Fudgey mousse choc with a really great crunchy base. Consistently good. Other cakes like green tea, mango, cheesecake are great too. Had a bad experience very recently. Sandwiches are ready-made - perhaps easy for those on-the-go but for those who wanna dine in, they just pick up from the same chiller and mildly heat it up (still cold)......... and serve. Serve in its takeout paperbag. No plate or utensils provided! I had to ask for it. I mean, hello, I'm paying to eat in and this is how u serve?! Cons: Years ago delivery was only $20 (or $25), and then they decided to up to to $50! Ridiculous, isnt it

I visited the Lobby Lounge recently with a colleague and a client to discuss some opportunities over a coffee. The coffee was OK, albeit we all ordered a different type of coffee (flat white, cappuccino and a latte) and they all came out looking pretty much identical. Same cup, same type of foam, same colour. Perhaps the strength was different, but I felt the coffee was served in incorrect cups.Finally, the price...oh the price. Being a hotel-linked cafe, you expect the prices to be higher than an dedicated cafe, but in this case the coffee was SGD 12 each. Each! With tax and tip, I paid SGD 42 for three coffees!!! That represents a 233% markup from a normal, Western-style cafe! Now I know I've become immune to Singapore prices, but this was way over the top.As a result, I'm never coming back based on the pricing alone. Anyone staying in the hotel is advised to walk 15 seconds into Millenia Walk shopping centre and go to one of the (better) cafes there. Shame on you Conrad...

My son and I enjoyed eating here while staying at the hotel. The breakfast buffet is superb. The choices seemingly unlimited. Everything is fresh and of the finest quality. We had the plan included in our room bill and felt that this was such a great deal that also included a lunch and dinner buffet as well as wi-fi.
5
Conducted a business meeting in the lobby. We all enjoyed the espresso and cappuccino. Service was outstanding. During our visit the restaurant was very empty which served us fine. By the way the meeting turned out successful, thank you Conrad!
3
normal range of spread. used to be better.
over priced
used to have more choices.
Not worth your pocket.
5
After a long day, it was nice to be back at the hotel and the lobby lounge was a wonderful place to relax and talk with friends.
4
I was willing to pay the tab when the singer was on, otherwise I'd just as soon go out back for half the price. Very attractive food for a buffet.
5
Just loved the ambiance and relaxed atmosphere, can't wait to go back ! Beautiful hotel very well maintained with excellent service from staff
3
Nice seating place, indoor and outdoor.
Good service from the server.
Acceptable price range.
Cakes and coffee just so average, I didn't feel like it was from five stars hotel chef.
4
Excellent service, good but expensive drinks. Only problem is there are very few people there. No entertainment to draw people in. I know this is an elegant style atmosphere but would be nice to have something to draw people in and have a little fun too.
5
I like the lobby lounge here. It's cosy and comfortable. I have a cappuccino and a club sandwich. The cappuccino is good enough for me though not the best I tried. The club sandwich is actually quite good. The ambience is nice for meeting up with friends and business. They also provide free newspaper. Services is as usual very high standard
5
Directly when you enter the Hotel you are amazed about this lobby with the huge trees and art and staircase. We loved it and the concierge desk is one of the friendliest ever. They take time to advise you. One of the staff even walked with us to the Metro station, to point out the entrance. Bravissimo !!

I was at Millenia Walk for a business meeting and my business contact suggested to meet at Conrad Centennial Hotel’s Lobby Lounge.Conrad’s Lobby Lounge has a small buffet spread, which allow us to have a quick bite while we meet.The main feature of the buffet is curries from around the world. To complement the curries, there’s a choice of fragrant coconut rice (ala Nasi Lemak) or a choice of 3 noodles (Thick white vermicelli/ Kway Teow/ Penne Pasta).There were 4 types of curries available:- Beef Rendang: This is good. The spices blended well together and gave the dish a nice flavour. It complemented the coconut rice extremely well. Must try!- Seafood Curry: This is done laksa style, where prawns and squid are cooked in a coconut curry. This goes well with the noodles. - Bengali Style Fish Curry: Instead of the usual fish head curry that is served, they use the same curry base and offer fish pieces. The fish are boneless, and goes well with the rice.- Vegetable Curry: This was mainly brinjal cooked in a curry sauce.There was also other stations avaiable for the buffet:- Soup and Bread Section: I tried the mushroom soup which was blended with cream. Its nice.- Salads: Two types of salads were available.- Baked item: Oven-baked fish was available.- Desserts: I tried the red velvet cake, orange puff, mini fruit tart, kueh lapis and panna cotta.- Fruits: A selection of fruits – Watermelon, longans, kiwi, promegranate and persimmon were available.- Coffee: I had the black coffee and iced Latte. Iced Latte is worth a mention, refreshing especially on a hot day.They also have a good tea selection (Ronnefeldt), which is aromatic.This is a good place to come for a quick executive lunch, where you can have a quick bite and still engage in a meeting with your business contact.The hotel also has just opened a deli which sells sandwiches (pizza slices at $4, and a ham and cheese croissant with coffee set at $10) and pastries, which I will try next time.Try it
