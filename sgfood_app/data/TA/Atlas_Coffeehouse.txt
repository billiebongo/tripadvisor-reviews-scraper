we ordered a carbonara and spicy wings. while the carbonara was flavourful, it was a challenge to finish because of how creamy the sauce was. The spicy wings were fabulous!
5
Big portion for each meal, that’s pod value for money. Like latter there and the truffle fries so much! But try to make a reservation beforehand as this place is quite popular, especially on weekends.
4
Small and busy cafe. So expect to wait a little even with a reservation. Offers a wide selection of coffee. Love the affogato! Limited brunch food selection as compared to other cafes.
5
A busy little coffee place. Came on a sat and the place was packed. Serves great pancakes and coffee.
4
Very crowded and busy but service is prompt. We liked the toffee but latte, but thought the signature banana butterscotch pancakes was little too dense and tasted more like hot pound cake
4
All-time favourite Atlas Butterscotch Pancake and Creamy Mushrooms on Sourdough topped with scrambled egg! Have never once disappointed in these dishes and always able to satisfy my brunch craving! It's a must to try them!
3
The food was not bad but the whole place was extremely crowded on a weekend. It was rather noisy too, due to the crowd so definitely not a place where you can chill to have conversations with friends. More for groups instead of couples / quiet times
4
When I ordered a ice long black with soy milk added in and the cashier gave me a confused frown saying that they only serve it on the side. No big deal because there's no difference for me so I agreed. We ordered the Breakfast Pita; the portion was just nice. Staff were efficient and helpful. Will probably come back
5
Still one of my favorite places for cafes . Brought 2 of my korean friends who had never been there and they were so impressed by the food and ambience of the cafe . Great mention to their Superbowls, it was so good that we whipped it off in seconds . And of course , to their Atlas Signature Pancake which is a MUST-TRY ,it was so AMAZING. I've never seen a pancake before that looked like a literal cake made in a pan. It was so fluffy and had the right texture and moistness to it, It had a scoop of homemade ice cream as well as crunchy maple syrup cereal bits and bananas. It was so massive that u need to share with at least 2 people . Definitely worth a repeat visit
2
The food was ok and the people are friendly. However, the store is very crowded and the waiters/waitress kept moving around and clearing all your plates to hint to you that you should leave the store soon. Not a good place to chill out with friends as you always have the feeling that they want you to leave soon
4
Good vibes, my go to for coffee and a healthy lunch. Tables are close and it’s so popular that sharing tables is common.
5
i love this place!!! is my to go place for some comfort food and just chill :) i love the pancake which is thick and fluffy which come together with the honeycomb ice cream :)
3
Was surprised that the place was packed even on a weekday afternoon. Food was not bad with many options.
4
We tried the salted caramel waffles and the chocolate croissant. They were pleasant. A bit too heavy on the salted caramel sauce though.
5
I had the creamy mushroom on sourdough toast - love the mushrooms, and how I can customize it by adding on bacon/sausage. My usual order there. Plus the coffee is always strong and creamy which I enjoy.
5
Fave brunch place. Remember to book before hand as it gets crowded.
1. Pancakes
2. Waffle
3. Creamy mushroom
4. Pulled pork
5. Cold brew
4
Great vibes to chill out on a weekend. Reservations recommended to ensure seats upon arrival as it’s always crowded.
4
No doubt the service here is top notch, servers were very friendly and attentive. Food was yummy!! But downside was that it is pretty expensive. And also there were some bones in my salmon which i presume is not supposed to be the case. Because i ordered at an off peak hour, my sunny side up was probably also one of the old ones left in the warming cabinet because it was stale and the yolk was dry. Would also like to see more small platters/snacks for people who visit in the afternoons for a cup of coffee (which is good) and to do some work and chil
5
Some cafes make you feel self-consious when you enter, but from the start of my experience in Atlas, it was relaxed, communal, and the staff frequently smiled. It doesn't hurt that the food was great. Will definitely bring friends back. Also, it's so convenient to get to, just a short 5 minute walk from the Botanics circle line exit (turn left at the exit).
5
Had lunch at Atlas on a weekday and the cafe was packed, this shows how popular they were and how good their food was. Tried their truffle fries, carbonara and mushrooms on toast. The portion was quite big and the food was really good and so was the coffee. Definitely would recommend this place and would definitely return again!
5
My husband loves the coffee here and the food is consistently good! Only annoyance is the lack of parking.
5
I made a reservation, and despite it being very busy, we didn't have to wait for our table. The service was ver good, staff were friendly and accommodating. Food was above par, and I'd definitely come back. A pity parking is limited!
4
always a good time at atlas, very well done pancakes and coffee, have to book in advance for weekends.
5
Honey bacon waffles are a definite must try!!! So is the atlas superbowl which has crunchy kale, juicy cherry tomatoes, deliciously marinated chicken thighs and miso eggplants!:)
5
We love the interior decoration and feel of the restaurant. Food options were interesting, we will return for more! :)
4
Atlas Coffeehouse is always filled with people. you got to have the patience or the time if you will like to dine here.
3
1st time at Atlas Coffeehouse. Ordered Capuccinno, Truffle Fries, Creamy Mushrooms On Sourdough with Scrambled Egg and Butterscotch Banana Pancake. Our favourite was the Butterscotch Banana Pancake. It was warm and moist, perfect for sweet tooth lovers.Truffles Fries would have fare better if it was served more hot. Seat wasn't comfy - not a place for chillax.
5
Me and some friends of mine went there at noon on weekday, and surprisingly almost full house even it was not on the weeken. Suggest to book in advance. And 4 of us almost ordered everything on the menu, we had salmon soba, super bowl, chicken, and banana pancake (MUST TRY!) and Earle grey waffles. None of above were disappointed us!! And we all fully satisfied!! Def will go back again!
4
Worried when I first arrived as they did not have a table available for my booking. After 15 minutes, the rest of my group arrived and we were seated down. Key Lime Pie (around $6.90) and Sea Salt Caramel Carrot Cake (around $8) was great. Very busy in 2017, hope they have less difficulties accommodating to the crowd in 2018
4
We arrived early for our reservation, and waiter was quick to get us a table and accommodate to us for adding one more person. Food came out very quickly and all our requests were attended to promptly, i.e. adding candles to cake, additional orders. Low & Slow Pulled Pork was slightly salty for my friend. I love the Summer Chicken Stew as it was the best dish to have on a stormy afternoon. All in all, nice ambience, very instagrammable place and a pleasant experience. It is a popular place, so we couldn't linger too long after finishing our food to give up the table for the crowd outside.
5
We are regulars to Atlas with the family. Expect to reserve a table as they are always full especially on weekends. The salted caramel ice cream waffles is our all-time favorite and the coffee is consistently good. I call Atlas my perfect coffee-fix joint!
5
Great food and coffee! Service was fast and friendly even though it was packed on Boxing day! Thankfully we made a reservation on Chope!
4
Awesome food! The food taste good and it's definitely instagram worthy! I now understand the long queue...
4
Waffles are very good. Strawberry pancakes - cakevis nice but too much and became dry after a while.
3
Went w family of 6 so tried almost all the mains found taste to be mediocre. Drinks wise coffee was sweet, so were the pancake and waffles.
5
Food is good! Pancakes and scrambled eggs. However, always crowded and recommend to eat very very slowly as they will start to chase us away in a very nice way.
4
Great place to hang out. However, the premises does get a little crowded and noisy during peak hours.
4
We went on a crowded sun for brunch and the cafe was bustling. Food was served promptly, and pancakes were fluffy
3
Friendly staff, but small space, not very convenient to sit long, food and drinks quite standard, nothing really special except the long queue and the staff.
4
The food here is really good, especially the truffles fries which is really worth the price we paid for it. The sourdough bread however was a disappointment as it was tough (almost impossible to bite). But other than that, the scrambled eggs and mushrooms were great.
5
This is like my 3rd time visiting here. Loved the food and service here. Especially the waffles. Staff is also very friendly. Would definitely be back again.
5
All the items we ordered such as Mushroom Cheese on toast or pulled pork on toast were fantastic and the service staff were responsive. I would surely make another trip down for a good brunch!
4
Love the coffee, service is attentive. No service charge apply. Walking distance from botanic gar mrt
5
We are regulars at Atlas. Staff is efficient , polite & attentive. Perennial favourites are the waffles and pancake, both were excellent items.
5
Visited once again for their stellar coffee and priced affordable. Loved their filter coffee and their Super Bowl
2
The ambience was nice and cold brew bottled coffee was good, albeit expensive. The food was presented nicely but was too salty and my salmon had a sour taste which made us wonder if it was abit spoiled/not fresh
3
Food was average, so was the coffee. Ambience and interior were great, however felt that the cafe is overhyped. Many raved about their waffles but was quite disappointed because it was just normal.
3
First off, parking was difficult. Only limited roadside parking nearby. We had a main and coffee each, costs us about $50-60. For the quality of food and atmosphere, I find it too expensive. The kale chips in the Atlas Superbowl and grilled miso eggplant were nice but overall, the combination of the other ingredients could be better. They just don't go together somehow. The "magic" coffee was abit too sour for my liking. Hence, it's kind of a disappointing first visit for us
4
Two words. One hashtag. #trufflefries. Found this cafe on Burpple as a friend and I were deciding where we could meet in between dragging ourselves to Orchard Road for brunch, VS. staying put in Adam Road or Bishan for a kopitiam brunch (nothing wrong with that, but we wanted somewhere quieter to chat). It's a hidden gem amongst the row of shops on Duke's Road and boy were we glad to have chanced upon it.We were here for brunch on Sunday and to nobody's surprise, there was a line of hungry people waiting to be served. There was an iPad just outside the door with the Chope app installed for you to input your mobile number and it will call you once a table is available. Due to it's proximity to the Singapore Botanic Gardens, there were a lot of patrons dressed in their work-out attire and majority of them were in groups (assuming they decided to go for their morning run, then enjoy brunch together).My friend and I ordered our own breakfast meals but was recommended by our waiter to try their truffle fries. No regrets and we loved it! It came in a huge bowl pilled with a heaping of shredded cheese. I am a huge fan of truffle fries and this was perfect. The fries were not greasy and truffle oil not overpowering. Great recommendation by their staff and a must-order when visiting! P.S. Cafe, you have a competitor. Be warned. :
3
There was a slight waiting time outside the cafe, thankfully I made a reservation to visit on a weekday. We ordered the Soba with salmon and the strawberry maple pancakes to share, the pancakes is a must order! It was really good, a lot better than the other pancake places in Singapore. Do eat it when it's warm as it'll harden slightly after. The strawberry pancakes does not come with honeycomb ice cream but it goes really well together, we opted to top up $3.50 for a scoop. If you order the banana pancakes, the honeycomb ice cream is inclusive. *Also noticed the staff having to go around every now and then to ask if they could clear the plates for the customers.
4
I had pancakes here which was amazing and the sauce in it was also amazing and very good also.Service was not good.
3
Visited on a Sunday having had made a reservation, but still had to wait outside for about 15min more before we could be seated. Probably due to the crowd I figure. Cafe menu was interesting but the food didn't taste as wonderful as I hoped.
4
Tasted quite sweet even without maple syrup. Perfect combi of pancake and banana and ice cream. Huge serving meant for sharing. Can try their mushroom sourdough as a salty alternative as well. A little pricey though.
4
butterscotch banana pancakes were amazing, but matcha waffles were disappointing - waffles were a tad too tough and matcha ice cream was meh.
5
The food portions are generous and we'll priced.
one of the must try is the Creamy Mushroom on Sourdough which is amazing!!
For drivers, do note that road side parking might be a challenge, thou you can easily secure a lot at Crown Centre beside
4
Atlas is known for their extremely good food, and they certainly do not disappoint. One tip though, visit during non peak hours to enjoy the right ambience!
5
Very reasonable pricing! Favourite scrambled eggs and mushrooms and sourdough! Always crowded and recommends reservation!
3
We ordered the atlas superbowl and pulled pork. Food was replicable at home, nothing really special and worth the hype. Service was unacceptable as we were brushed off curtly when we notified the waitress that we waited 20mins for the superbowl.
4
I’ve been to Atlas 5-6 times and i must say the food is still as good! However, the coffee can be hotter. Probably didn’t heat the milk well.
3
An enjoyable bowl of Salmon Soba Noodles ($18+). Loved the super moist salmon, though the skin wasn't crispy. I don't give two hoots about fish skin, but I don't think it was meant to be crispy in the first place & I'm just putting it put there.The accompanying house-made yogurt was not necessary as I was quite happy without it. (For the record, it was fine.) The juicy shimeiji mushrooms & crispy fried egg (oozy yolk yay) were great together with the soba noodles & salmon.In all, would've been a great experience if not for the sub-par service. Under no circumstances should you ever clear the glass(es) of your customer(s) without asking - especially if they're midway eating, or if their glass of water isn't even empty. That was a clear sign that our servers (happened more than once) wanted us to get out, probably because there was a long line of people waiting to get in.Needless to say, we left with quite a bad taste in our mouths. Which is a pity because we actually enjoyed the food. Accepts credit cards Air-conditioned seats only Accepts reservations - I used Chope No service charge✔️ GST charge
5
Ordered atlas Super bowl, creamy mushroom sourdough and strawberry pancake. All quite nice. Must book in advance.
5
My 3rd time at Atlas Coffeehouse and got to try the Salmon Soba and Pulled Pork from the breakfast menu. It was fantastic! The food never disappoints!
5
brought my friend from Indonesia who is a coffee drinker....he is very satisfied with the coffee here. the way they brew the coffee is excellent...
5
excellent brunch cafe and good food that worth the wait. the cafe is usually very crowded on weekends and public holiday, be sure you make reservation via chope.
4
We ordered the chef recommended dishes. They are the banana pancake and white wine mushrooms with scrambled eggs. Both are worth to try!
3
It used to be something I really enjoyed, now it’s just alright. The waffle is nice but not fantastic.
4
Place was very packed and aisles were really squeezy but the food was really good. The mushroom toast and banana pancakes are a must try!
5
Advantages:- The food! Had the salted caramel waffles and truffle fries!- The drinks- Great service- They use an amazing app called Chope which allows you to reserve a table and get notified via phone when your table is ready Disadvantages:- the crowd. Be prepared to queue- the space. Combined with the crowd, it can get pretty cramped (we got seated at the very back near the kitchen)- toilet was a little dirty which is surprising for Singapore
4
Nice breakfast and decent coffee. A tip will be to reserve and go especially during the weekend. Gets very crowded. Tried the mushroom with sourdough and it was pretty good. The croissant was pretty good as well. Coffee was not as hot as I'd have liked but I can give that a pass.
4
My friend and I shared the chicken stew and all day breakfast..pretty decent overall tho i felt the chicken stew could have been a bit less watery.Vanilla earl grey cake was mediocre with no taste of earl grey whatsoever.Stick to the mains and coffee
4
Service and atmosphere is good. Due to the small place, we have to share table with others, making it squeezy. Food was good, but makes us thirsty at the end of the day. Overall, cafe is good for gatherings.
4
The Farmers Pasta and Salmon Soba Noodles were delicious. Reservation was easy via the Chope app and service staff were attentive.
5
Finally time to have a brunch! Thanks to a holiday :) The truffle fries and scrambled eggs never disappoints me! Awesome food! Everyone should come here :D
3
The atmosphere was slightly too noisy and a small cafe area. Best to make bookings beforehand. Else weekend waiting time might be slightly long. Cafe menu is limited but dish was of good quality. Slightly on yhe pricier side.
5
Atlas offers delectable cafe food with attentive services. It wasn't hard to get the staff's attention. Make sure you make reservation to avoid waiting in the queue!
4
The food is nice and price is reasonable. The pancakes and waffles are a must try. No service charge.
5
Food was really yummy. Came here a few times and tried a lot of dishes but nothing has disappointed me so far!
5
The creamy mushroom on sourdough was really good. The Truffle fries were lacking the truffle flavours. Signature Atlas Pancake was fluffly and good for sharing.
5
Great place and the atmosphere is good. Food is nice and service is good. The only thing is that it’s Super busy in the Saturday we visited. My friends and I was chatting happily and lose track of time. They’ll hint you to leave by repeatedly asking if they could clear the plate, or take away the half down water bottle. Well, when we leave, apparently there’s a Long queue, so I don’t blame them at all. But it’ll be better if they could tell us upfront that the hour is limited to 2 hours per table or less
4
Read many positive reviews about the cafe, so decided to visit with friend for brunch. It was a weekday late morning & the cafe was almost full house! After trying the Atlas Superbowl & Atlas Butterscotch Banana Pancake, it wasn't hard to know why it's so crowded even on a weekday, despite its out-of-town location. I especially like the pancake for its fluffiness. Highly recommend to visit & try. :
5
Atlas is one of the few cafes in Singapore which makes the travel to Bukit Timah worth it. A reservation in advance is a must especially if you plan to eat here during peak hours and weekends. Candied bacon waffle is my absolute favourite.
4
Atlas dishes are very generous on cheese which is good for cheese-lovers :)
hope it can close later and have a dinner menu
3
Was very crowded and really noisy.The pancake was really nice. However service was lukewarm.would suggest going on off peak periods to really enjoy the food and place.
1
Over crowded over-rated hipster cafe meant only for those who think they are hipster with so-so food.
Food didnt live up to reviews and expectations. The Chope reservation was completely useless and meaningless.
5
Great waffles and coffee. best for breakfast before / after a lovely morning walk in botanic garden.
4
The service was good but the quantity wasn’t v big. The taste was ok and the atmosphere was good! Even tho the table spacings were qt small
5
Our second time here, and the food never disappoints :) Decently priced too! Lovely ambience, a pity they close early (7pm)!
4
Pros:- Nice heavy breakfast options - definitely filling- Pretty good coffee- Nice ambience with good natural sunlight coming in- Service staff are nice- right in front of a bus stop and not that far from Botanic Gardens MRT so very accessible by public transportCons- not exactly cheap- parking is a bit hard- small food menu that doesn't change frequentl
3
So I had heard so much about this place that we came here to try the food. Atmosphere was nice so it looked promising but in the end I was disappointed. They had a great looking breakfast menu and I was really looking forward to the food. Nowadays a lot of hipster cafe make their own food and its original e.g. Own bacon or salmon. This place did not (think the Local). We ordered the soba but my daughter found it too vinegary. I would come here again but if there is a queue etc etc then there are just too many other places like this
4
I enjoyed the chicken stew ($18+) which was surprisingly quite substantial. The Carbonara pasta was also authentic ($19+). Unfortunately the banana pancake took 30 minutes to prepare (despite them quoting 10-15 minutes), and it turned out to be too sweet for consumption.All in all, decent food at decent prices. A pity I did not get to try the coffee, I may come back for a revisit.Note that a additional 7% GST charge is levied on all prices. Payment is made upfront when ordering at the counter, so no additional service charge applies. The server seemed inexperienced and had to swipe my payment card twice, the second time for the taxes
5
Unpretentious. Bloody good coffees. Food is surprisingly good too. Gets quite packed during lunchtime so stroll in after 1.30pm and you'll eacape the buzz.
5
My fav cafe which I frequent at least twice a month, love that they recently introduced more desserts on their menu, I tried all the cakes & tarts and love all of them. Service is consistently good.
4
Great texture and taste, good choices of savoury and sweet dishes, yummy coffee too. Refreshing always
5
This is our second time here and the food is still yummy! Super love their signature butterscotch banana pancake, crisp outside fluffy inside! Just a little pricey. Truffle fries portion is good too! Will be coming back for more!!
4
We ordered the earl grey waffles and salted caramel waffles. Both were good - waffles were crisp outside n soft inside.
Seating was abit cramped though but I will return for the great waffles
5
nice coffee. nice and generous serving of truffle fries. nice and friendly staff. would definitely go back again.
5
Atlas Coffeehouse is very popular for a reason! Serving all day breakfast food, they can satisfy your brunch cravings any time. The restaurant was busy on Sunday morning, and we were glad we made a reservation. You order at the counter and the food comes very quickly, I think they are pushing for fast turnover!We had the breakfast hash and the mixed berries waffles, both were very good. The waffles (which come in some other specialty flavors like earl grey and matcha) were the highlight. True to its name, Atlas also has a selection of fancy coffees, from cold brew to aeropress to espresso. I had one of the aeropress coffees and the quality was excellent!I would highly recommend for anyone looking for a casual, but delicious, breakfast/brunch place. The prices are also very reasonable! The waffles, which were very big, only set me back $13.50.
5
It's pretty crowded on weekends, and regardless of the time you go there's always a crowd.The food though is yummy. I loved their key lime tart in particular! I'd go back once a month to get it even though I stay 20km away because it's THAT GOOD
5
My go-to place for a good cup of coffee and a scrumptious meal if I want to indulge- their candied bacon waffles are absolutely delicious. And their Atlas Super Bowl is the perfect combination of yummy but not too guilty. But the best part for me has got to be their coffee. They do the best Soy Flat Whites in town. Not many places can do a soy coffee well. Their regular flat whites and lattes are superb too. Ps. Key Lime Pie. Also a must have. Right balance of Sweet and Tart. And a crust to die for
3
crowded and party of five with reservation had to share half a table with another party. understand limited seats but sunday brunch with friends should be more relaxed and chilled unlike the kopitiam experience at CBD on a weekday. many probably enjoy people watching there than the food which is mostly pre-cooked and reheated before served. coffee is good though
4
This cafe served really nice and quality coffee. But the location is quite inconvenient. The breakfast looks appetizing but taste abit bland for me.
4
We ordered buttermilk waffles and sourdough with mushrooms - both excellent. Service was very good but be prepared not to move while eating or else you will bump into the people next to you.
5
Everything was great from coffees to truffle fries to the sourdough, enjoyed the sourdough and mushroom white wine sauce alot!
5
Coffee was amazing! So was the salmon soba. Will definitely be back again! The waffles are value for money!
5
this was my 6th time here with friends, and the new favourite is the soba noodles - stumbled on it when they did not have my usual prawn pasta. pretty crowded on weekends so do head down early.
4
This place serves a very good coffee and generous food portions. My friend found it expensive but I felt the prices reflected the current market prices - I don't think they charge more than the other modern brunch places. I had the signature pancakes - nothing out of the ordinary honestly, my friend's eggs and hash were much nicer.
4
Atlas coffeehouse serves quality food. I'm a big fan of their salmon soba noodles. Their pancakes are very good too. One of their setback is parking whereby you can't get shelter and I've changed my lunch location a few times due to bad weather condition. In addition, it would be perfect if they've bigger tables with more space as I'm sure customers with bigger bags will experience the same problem as me.
5
Atlas Coffeehouse is a lovely place, with great exterior design and delicious food. There's a reason why the place is always very crowded and buzzing with commotion :) The truffle fries are really good, one of the must-haves there.I especially loved the Atlas Banana Butterscotch Pancake as well (really fluffy!) Do note that you will probably have to wait 15 to 20 minutes for that because it will be freshly made for you
5
We had Farmer's pasta, ATLAS hash, truffle fries and buttermilk waffles with berries. It was delicious. The portion given is generous and the menu offering is unique. Keen to come back again and try other food.Place is crowded and noisy on a weekend due to its popularity but the service is quick. Will definitely return again.
5
We got a table at 6pm, unaware that the place was closing in 1h. I appreciate the still very top-notch quality of food (order the toast with mushrooms and eggs, summer chicken stew and Earl Grey waffles! The mushroom especially is worth a special mention) and amazing staff who made sure that we still receive service. However it got a bit awkward as they started to clean up around 6.30pm, and we were the only customers left trying to chomp down the food. Still, thumbs up for the food and people, but come early
5
Wonderful and cozy place with good food options! They're really generous with their parmesan cheese and the truffle fries are only $8 for such a big portion. Would definitely return!
5
Food portion was great, the mushroom on sourdough is really good. I'll be back for other food items in future.
4
Better than average casual dining. Small restaurant. Cosy ambience. But you got to be punctual when reserving. They don't hold seats for too Long.
5
Food and drinks are great, and the environment is chill. Maybe a bit pricey for a brunch place. Tip: Make a reservation to secure a seat
4
Atlas is my neighbourhood coffee joint that serves up good pastas and waffles. It can get crowded so a reservation is recommended.
5
I love the pancakes at Atlas Coffeehouse! They are really the best! I will definitely be going back again!
4
Everything was great. Coffee was abit sour and the milk was flat. I get that he was busy and it's okay
5
Good coffee. Good crowd and good service. Just had coffee to waste time and its always good to people watch here.
5
would definitely travel all the way from the east just to eat their waffles again. cake selection was excellent too! mains were surprisingly filling.
4
Past by few times but didn't manage to try it as it's always crowded. Finally got half day off and decided to try it out.. Even though its just noon time, the place is still crowded.I ordered Chicken Stew & waffles.. The chicken was tender and good. Portion was almost good for 2. Staff was friendly and helpful too. Waffles was good. Will definitely be going back again to try their other food
5
Atlas is definitely one of my favourite cafes in Singapore. Queue is pretty long over the weekends, do reserve a table at Chope in advance!
4
Hipster cafe with very nice ambiance. Always back here because they have great coffee and food. However, I had better waffles when they were Assembly(Evans rd). Service crew are awesome!
3
The food we ordered were great, love the truffle fries. Price is slightly on the high side. Service was good. Will recommend to family and friends.
4
Fluffy pancake served at Atlas and portion of the food is generous for the items we ordered. Suitable for sharing in groups.
4
The food we ordered were great! We had earl grey caramel waffles, truffle fries and Atlas superbowl. The down side was my coffee was cleared while I was packing up and there was obviously still coffee in it.
4
The food here is nice and priced reasonably. Overall ambience is good for family or dates or friend outing. Service staff is very friendly and helpful.
4
atlas serves good scrambled eggs and their waffles are one of the most preferred for me. the cafe could get really crowded and noisy at times though!
4
Cosy environment with friendly service crew. Made the orders at the counter, and food was promptly served despite the crowd. Very tasty food and coffee was great. Will definitely recommend friends and return again!
4
Earl grey waffles was refreshing and good, and breakfast set with hash was one of our favourites. Toffee Latte was a tad too sweet for our liking, but overall good food! We live nearby so we'll definitely visit again.
5
Always love coming back here. Always be sure to make a reservation on Chope as if you come at normal brunch timings, you almost definitely will not be able to get a seat. Love the candied bacon waffles, I have tried almost everything on the menu before. However, today the chicken stew was a tad bit too salty. The scrambled eggs here are always perfect though
4
Food and ambience is good. The service staff were attentive to our needs. Will come back again. Hopefully by then, we can try some new menus.
5
Food is really good there, coffee is amazing as well.
One of the best waffles I've eaten so far; crispy outside yet fluffy and soft inside.
4
It was my first visit with my family and we enjoyed the signature sourdough dish and the mushroom carborana ! Yummy!
4
Reservations are a must if you visit on the weekend and want to avoid queueing. The food and coffee here are very decent - expect to spend about $20+ per pax for a main and a coffee.
5
A good place to have brunch with very good ambience. However, it could be a bit crowded. Therefore will recommend to make reservation before heading there.
5
Love the flavours in the salmon soba and hearty summer chicken stew! Am a huge fan of the bottled cold brews as well :) This is one of my go-to spots to chill/read a book.
4
A friend and I visited this cafe for desert after eating a late lunch at a nearby Thai restaurant.Even though it was a Tuesday and it was mid-afternoon, it was still quite crowded, however we were still able to find a table.The staff were friendly and our Salted Caramel Buttermilk Waffle with Vanilla Ice Cream, which we shared ($12.50), arrived quickly. It was absolutely delicious, crispy on the outside and lovely and soft and fluffy on the inside. I could have happily eaten a whole one myself had I not been too full from my Thai meal. The next time I'm in Singapore I'll be making a special trip to Atlas for a waffle all to myself
4
Pancakes were good! However, i felt the other mains didn't meet my expectations, went down after seeing the multiple reviews, hence expected every dish to be great.Coffee was good, noticed they were more family-oriented, lots of kids (baby friendly!).Might revisit the next time i'm in Singapore
5
Started my day with awesome fluffy pancakes. They are lovely, but the place easily packed with people, so try to be there earlier to have a seat, if not you have to wait for a seat.Nice place to have a coffee and small talks, it can get really noisy most of the time
4
We went here for breakfast. The menu is small and a little pricy for the quantity of food. However the quality of food ( I had the Atlas Hash, which is decent). The coffee is excellent and well worth the price. I would recommend the coffee and pastries. The dishes are rather small but good quality.

Food was always so awesome every time we came. Love the strawberry maple/butterscotch banana pancakes, french toast, creamy mushrooms on sourdough, atlas hash, shoe string fries.. Exceptional coffee. Make sure you book in advance or be prepared to wait outside in the hot sun!
5
Awesome waffles and friendly staff made our experience at Atlas a very good one! Child friendly with baby chairs also.
4
they make a very good coffee which i would recommend.
their brunch is awesome.
please make sure you have your reservation or be prepared to wait for 20-30 mins (walk in customer)
4
Super love the customer service at Atlas Coffeehouse! Seeing that a friend and i wanted to take photos, one of the staff took initiative to help us take some at the shopfront.
Environment good for chatting.
Food was good for sharing.
5
Love their candied bacon waffle and hot chocolate. Love the idea of early opening (8am), means dropping kids in school and turn in for a breakfast is a perfect way to start the day. Latte served also nice. Shoe strings fries is another to try.
4
The place is very hip. Lots of happpening in the cafe. Enjoyable experience. Coffee is reasonable and they offer 1 free cup with 6 cups purchased.
3
Decent coffee but food was a little underwhelming. Hash was just a big pile of mush and for the egg, while the crispy bottom was interesting, I still prefer a runny yolk
4
Love the coffee. Ambience wAs really nice. table was reserved. Had a nice afternoon there. Will return.
4
We tried the soba & salmon and superbowl for the mains. The salmon was cooked perfectly and the egg was good too. Taste was delish. Superbowl was good overall altough the aubergine was a tad too salty. We had the earl grey waffles and it was delish too. Crispy on the outside but still soft in the inside. Service staff were friendly even though they were busy
5
Had the flat whites and two mains. Cereal prawn pasta and pulled pork sandwich. Both were extremely tasty and well done! Might be pricey for cafe food at $20 per dish on average, but really fast turnaround on food service. Also had salted caramel waffle, which was fluffy with a generous scoop of ice cream. Strongly recommend to purchase vouchers via chope to save some money!
5
My go to place for good coffee. Generous portions for food and delicious too. Atlas also has a nice variety of cakes and pastries.
4
I would recommend to have the summer chicken stew. It is nice and there's a taste of herb within the stew which I love it. The portion is quite big and I would say is worth the price.
4
First, the aroma of coffee is beautiful once you step in! we had a variety of food from the menu and it was good, value for money as well. Friendly staff as well. Definitely a place you need to make reservations for the weekend!
5
Enjoyed my second visit here and making reservation via Chope was easy. Would definitely visit again.
4
Ambience is not bad, though it can be quite loud during weekends
Food is generally well seasoned, with a decent selection (we had the atlas breakfast plate & atlas bowl). Though crowded, service was still pretty good.
Will revisit again for the dessert!
4
I had brunch here and thought the salmin soba was good. However i felt that thr portion has reduced as compared to my last visit. Nonetheless, food is tasty!
5
Good service, best coffee I have ever tasted in singapore cafes, food portion is just nice and tasty. A bit noisy though.
5
The iced toffee with ice cream is value for money; I had to dilute it with water as I'm not exactly a coffee connoisseur. The mini-chino for kids was hot chocolate with mini marshmallows that delighted my girl. The truffle fries is scrumptious and looked all appetising with the grated cheese which enhanced the taste. Will revisit to try other menu items, provided this place has space... it's a popular coffee place as the food and drinks are real good
4
Would recommend making a reservation, didn't have to wait upon arrival.Great portions for sharing. On my quest for best scrambled eggs, i ordered the creamy mushrooms and scrambled eggs on toast-the mushrooms were flavourful however overwhelmed the eggs a little. Banana pancake with icecream was delicious but can get sick of it after a few bites therefore sharing is always a good idea!
5
Great Coffee. Great atmosphere. Also - some of the staff have great taste in music. Reminds me of some hipster coffee houses in New York. Which I miss. It's a pretty good place to squat and work. Enough distraction to keep things from getting stale. But not too much. And good coffee. Cant recommend coming on weekends if what I describe above sounds pleasant. Atlas turns into a carnival. Sugar blasted carbs and screaming children are flying around the place and there are definitely no seats for you. Atlas closes weirdly early (6:30?). Maybe it's the neighborhood and not many customers come in after 5? But the Starbucks two blocks down is open until pretty late. This doesn't seem right. Atlas has a great location and vibe for late night writing.
4
Decent food. Reasonably priced. The carbonara was delectable. Will drop by again if I am in the area.
5
love the coffee and the fries, most of all the side of scrambled eggs that was sooo smooth and silky!
4
highly recommend the creamy mushroom on sour toast. Flavourful and portions were generous! great for dates
4
Food was great. Service was good and awesome place to chill in the morning for breakfast. Definitely coming back
5
Very good food, but their toffee latte tastes like iced chocolate. Go easy on the chocolate powder please.
5
The food was great and serve at a reasonable price. Friendly service as well. Will definitely go again!
5
Don't forget to make reservations! Walk-in queue will take quite some time (waiting in the humid outdoors is no fun!)
Food is amazing, staff is amazing. Must try the pancakes - so fluffy and light with very exotic flavours!
4
I only like their coffee, the other things like pastries are nothing great as I don;t believe they bake it in-house.
4
We ordered the creamy mushroom on sourdough + scrambled eggs, cereal prawn pasta and the shoestring truffle fries. All of them were pretty good and definitely kept two of us really full for the day. The only thing was that the seats were arranged really close to each other so you can literally hear the conversation of the customer beside you. Would be better if we could have slightly more privacy. The place was really packed too - I went on a Public Holiday
4
I've been to Atlas Coffeehouse twice and after trying several dishes each time, the butterscotch banana pancake still remains a firm favourite. I also enjoyed the creamy mushrooms on sourdough, though I probably wouldn't add scrambled eggs the next time as it did not contribute much to the depth of flavour. The portions were huge - definitely grab a few more friends if you'd like to try more dishes
4
Have been a fan since Assembly Coffee days. The place to go for a reliable cup of coffee and waffles. There are more food offerings now. With the farmers pasta and hot wings as my usual favourites.
5
Good food good coffee. Great place for breakfast. Book ahead to avoid having to wait in queue. There's deliveroo service too.
4
I'm a frequent visitor of ATLAS and I love th for the consistency in their quality of food. However in my event visit, I notice the staffs look rather distressed and the vibe was very unwelcoming. ATLAS butterscotch banana pancake is highly recommended!
4
We went here for breakfast and the menu looked great. We weren't disappointed when the food came out, the Atlas Hash and the Butterscotch&Banana pancakes. It seems to be quite family friendly and staff was fast. Can't complain.
5
We came here for afternoon tea. The truffle fries were excellent and the portion size was perfect for sharing in a party of 4. One of my friends ordered the pasta which was disappointing small and not worth the high price. Overall great experience!
4
Service staff doesn't smile. Suggest to have pictures on food menu. The Summer Chicken in soup is very jce
5
The berries pancake is even better than the banana one as it's not too sweet for me. Mushroom on sourdough is as nice as usual. Love everything. Could be better if aircon isn't so cold.
4
Ordered the low and slow pulled pork and it only comes with a slice of sourdough. Bacon was a little hard and non sweet type, but pulled pork and scrambled egg were nice. It comes with lots of pull pork too. The creamy mushroom in sourdough comes with 2 slices of sourdough and the portion was big! The place was packed at 9.30am to 10.45am while we were there. Reservations required if you want to secure a seat
4
Lucky to be able to book online for reservation as it was very crowded & need to wait for a table. Tables & chairs were placed quite close to each other, abit cramped.Had their banana butterscotch pancake, not too bad tho portion is abit big for 1 pax Pulled Pork was quite salty.
5
We love this salted caramel â›¬ waffle which has a nice full moist aromatic taste. We tried stewed chicken and salmon soba. Both come in generous serving. The restaurant operates from 8 am to 7 pm from Tuesday to Sunday. You need to turn up at 6 pm if you are heading there for dinner so that you don't have to rush through dinner.
5
Went Atlas on a Sunday! Pretty good environment to have an awesome brunch! The truffle fries and Earl grey waffle was the best :D The creamy scrambled eggs with mushroom is also a must to order! ☺️
4
The restaurant has a good ambience and convenient to get there. Service is good and Iced tea is delicious.
5
My Husband loves the coffee here! Consistent quality of food and beverages.
Friendly staff who makes the effort to recognise regular customers.
4
They make great pancakes. Will come back again for the pancakes and waffles. The butterscotch ice cream is yummy too.
5
Being a regular coffee drinker, finding the right cuppa is a gem. I've found one in Atlas.
Don't just read review, try it to believe.
5
Went there with my partner and was pleasantly surprised by the food! We love the mushroom with sourdough and scrambled eggs. Staffs were attentive and polite, and we would definitely come back and try the other mains!
4
The coffee and waffles were good as usual. Even with no reservation, I could see the queue moving very fast outside. Their service was also impeccable!
5
I'd dined at Atlas Coffeehouse with family on a weekend morning in Feb'17. As it was quite early the cafe wasn't that busy yet. Food was great! So I brought my friends back for lunch on 30 Apr 17. The place was busy and there were people waiting outside for seats. So glad I made a Chope reservation! What's worth the mention here was how the service was excellent despite how busy the cafe was. Staff were attentive and so pleasant. We didn't have to wait long for anything. Excellent service and ambience. Food was good, as usual. :)
4
We are pleased with the food especially the bacon for me. As for my friend she loves the whole combo of the pulled pork on sourdough. Table arrangement was good. Glad aren't like some restaurant if we r in 2s we are made to squeezed in between diners over here tables are slightly apart to give that arm length of privacy.
2
The food at the Atlas was good, but at the same time for what you get, it's too expensive! $18.50 for a pancake with a scoop of ice cream and some banana scattered around, or $18 for a 'Super Bowl' salad which is tasty but tiny is just too muchThey are busy, the place has a decent vibe and so they can probably get away with charging above average, but living close by we won't be going back as the value for money isn't there - we'd be happy to spend the money if the portions were larger, service better (long wait for some of our food - we were asked when paying if we'd like it all at once or as it comes - still one dish took 15 mins longer than others) and not such a wait - it used to be walk-in only but has changed so bookings are possible and as a result if you haven't booked there may be a wait outside in the rain/su
5
It was my 2nd time at Atlas Coffeehouse and I would go again in a heartbeat! Service was friendly and great. Reserved seats via Chope and very easy to redeem Chope vouchers. Food was great and arrived swiftly.
5
Had a great brunch at Atlas on a Saturday afternoon. Packed place, be sure to make reservations in advance.
5
Food never fails to please! Creamy mushrooms and scrambled eggs on point! Service could do better as waiters seemed to always be in a hurry to clear your plates.
5
Everything was good at Atlas coffeehouse, food was sumptuous and delicious, price is reasonable too.
3
Rather average place that is extremely cramped and crowded, with overpriced food that is way too sweet. Location is very convenient for me, but around the area, there're much places with much better food at the same price or less.
4
The berry waffle is good as usual. Crispy and the berries are a plenty. But their service level seems to have gone down a bit.
4
We had made reservations beforehand and lucky thing we did as it was quite crowded. We ordered a waffle ($12.50), their signature Creamy Mushrooms on Sourdough ($14) (add-on scrambled eggs $3) and a cup of hot coffee ($5) to share. Not sure if we should have mentioned for the waffles to be served later but the waffles arrived 1 minute before the mushrooms on sourdough. As the ice cream will melt, we ate the waffles first. The waffles was one of the best that I ever had, even better than ice cream parlors waffles. The ice cream was classic at its best. They used good quality vanilla ice cream and you could really taste the difference.I would say we ate the waffle within 7-8 mins? By then, the scrambled eggs were more thoroughly cooked and it did not have the runny consistency. The creamy mushrooms got a little cloying after a while too, so it is a good thing we shared it. All in all, we felt this dish did not live up to the hype and for the price paid ($17 with eggs) it was tad expensive too. I would return for the waffles though, it is really good! There is GST but no service charge.
4
It was my first time visiting this café and it was a birthday celebration for my friend.We ordered the salmon soba noodles and Altas bananas pancake. Both dishes are good. What impress me was the service. I called up the café to inform that I will be arriving 10 mins and I was greeted upon my arrival in my first name and when I left they said my first time and hope to see me soon. In addition, the staff noticed that we are sharing our dishes and they gave us 2 separate plates as well. I will be definitely be back again
4
Visited Atlas on a rainy Saturday afternoon. When I arrived, the cafe was packed, I'm glad that I made a reservation beforehand and was quickly seated.Ordering is straight forward and I got the creamy mushroom and Atlas hash. I particularly liked the creamy mushroom alot and find the Atlas hash average. I like my hashbrown crispy, in this case, because the hashbrown was stacked on by egg, bacon and greens, it became soggy.Overall experience is good and I would visit again for the creamy mushroom
4
This is my 3rd visit already and I have to say that the food doesn't disappoint each and everytime i try a different dish. Will definitely be back for a 4th / 5th time! The service staff can afford to be a little more cheerful though
4
I would actually say that Atlas is one of the better brunch places around - their signature pancakes were pretty awesome!
4
Scrambled eggs was good but could be less watery. Service was good but kept feeling they want to chase us away.
4
The service staff is friendly and helpful. Speed of food being served was surprisingly fast noting that it was full house on a Sunday noon peak period! Food is good especially the aglio olio..we repeated the order!
5
Came here for a coffee from a recommendation. We decided to have a bite to eat too. The food was delicious and freshly cooked. The waffles are also great as is the coffee. Service was very good and friendly. Highly recommended!
5
Always love this place for their excellent coffee and waffles. Their food offerings of pasta and breakfast are good as well. A well rounded place for a relaxing meal.
5
The food was really good, especially the soba salmon and sourdough bread with creamy mushroom. The waffles were awesome as well! Staff were attentive and polite.
4
Good place for people watching and passing time. Prompt service and polite staff is always a plus :)
3
Reserve before coming. Food was decent. Worth a try. Service was good. Price is normal cafe price. Sss
5
I went at 3pm on a work day and I was surprised to see so many customers! 1st sign of a good cafe. We ordered the Farmer's Pasta, Feel Good Blend Herbal Tea, Apple Crumble, Hazelnut Coffee, Spice Mid Wings and Earl Grey Waffles. Everything was fantastic! I really loved the tea and mid-wings. Will be back for more
2
Ordered a long black and a pastry with chocolate and pistachio. SGD 10,20Sounds delicious and it was smiling at me... Then: THEY MICROWAVED IT!!!I complained about my soggy pastry and the waiter told the manager, as I could see. She didn't bother to get of her seat and come to talk to me. After having a bite and leaving the remains with my empty coffee cup, BTW the coffee was decent, the staff who cleared it did not bother to ask me why I left so much behind...Won't come bac
5
Dee-li-cious! With a good cup of coffee that I wish had come together with the waffle. Next time I'll ask.
Aircon a bit too cold for me.
Will definitely go again -waffles were recommended, and I can recommend.
5
had a great experience at Atlas Coffeehouse....great food...should try the salmon soba....and bananan pancake...good ambience...good coffee....
5
Place is very busy so a reservation is definitely recommended. The food was good as was the service.
4
Ordered the dark choc and apple crumble tarts. dark choc tart is good, not too sweet...full of choc taste 👍
4
Went with my 2 young boys and they enjoyed their waffles very much. The service is great! We will definitely come back.
3
What i like about Atlas is its interior design and ambience. A nice cafe to hang out and chat with friends. Food is ok but not worth the price.
5
I like that there's a staff attending to the crowd entering the cafe. We were immediately served as reservations were made. With Chope, it's fuss-free when it comes to getting a table! Everything was great - food were served quite fast as well. Would come back for desserts and coffee next time
5
Visited on a weekend 3pm to find the place filled to the brim. Thankfully I had made a reservation and was promptly seated by the friendly and efficient staff. Order the Atlas Hash, Butterscotch Banana Pancake, and Truffle Fries. In general, the food was pretty good and tasty. I was pleasantly surprised that the truffle fries cost just $8 and came in such a huge bowl. Also one of the few cafes where prices are proportionate to the quality, and quantity â€” a rare find in today's cafe scene. In short, this is one of the few cafes worth a revisit on my list, for a combination of factors listed above.
5
Ordered their earl grey waffles and farmer's pasta. WOW I'm totally speechless. DAMN TASTY. I'm the type whereby I hate veg till the core, and damn.... the pasta just amazing. I didn't know that veg pasta like this can be so tasty. Their pancakes and waffles are the BOMB.
5
Went there a few times and still love it. Small place so if is full house then you might need to wait. Love the candied bacon waffle. That's my usual order with their hot chocolate. Downside - they close too early at 7pm to catch dinner. Sometimes went over at 6:30pm and the staff said last order already
4
Food and service is desirable. Slightly small pasta portions. Hot chocolate was almost too watery. Can be improved.
5
It's a cafe like no other. Tried the chicken stew and pulled pork and both were delicious beyond words! The waffles were mediocre but really, go for every single dish on the menu.
5
I had great experience with my hubby and two kids, though I must say the place is rather cramp and noisy for family. But food and service is good! Worth making the trip down
4
Serves great waffles and truffle fries, good for small gatherings (up to 8 people), great ambiance (think hipster vibes). However, it is a little on the pricier side ($7 for a (small) drink of chocolate)
4
Had the atlas hash and butterscotch pancake. Both were very tasty - the pancake was particularly fluffy too!
4
Had the salmon and soba and never regretted my decision. Soba was not soggy at all but springy. The sauce used really completed the dish well!
5
Best carbonara ever tasted! Blew my mind! On the other hand the scrambled egg which I came for paled in comparison
4
The cafe was walking distance from the MRT station and opened from Tuesday to Sunday 8am to 7pm. While there was no 10% service charge, there was a 7% GST charge in the bill. Pay as you order at the counter. Low & Slow Pulled Pork (S$20+)Braised pulled pork, scrambled eggs , streaky bacon , arugula served on sourdoughThe serving was huge. The pulled pork was topped with curry like sauce, quite tender and savoury but a tab too salty on its own. The bacon was a tab salty too. The scrambled eggs was creamy. The arugula was lightly dressed. The sourdough was soft which I like best.White Cold Brew (S$7+)Recommended to have the drink without ice cubes so that one can taste the chocolatey notes more easily. Although it was non sweeten, it was not bitter in taste.Overall the food was not bad. The crowd started to come in at around 9am, so best came early
5
Atlas provides decent coffee with a large variety of cold brew and expresso. They also have an interesting brunch meal, I would recommend trying the quinoa bowl and pulled pork. Otherwise, the main reason for us to come to Atlas is the dessert. The Key lime tart and Macha Waffles bring us back here almost every other week. Definitely a must-try. Best time to visit is weekday late afternoon as it gets quite crowded on weekends, so a longer waiting time is needed
5
We popped by on a Sunday 3pm to find the place entirely filled up. Randomly ordered 2 mains that turned out generally decent. But what I like about the place is the atmosphere and crowd. Another hipster joint to have a coffee and catch up with friends
4
Nice food and great place for a weekend chill-out. Good location at just a short walk from the Botanic Gardens MRT exit A. The cafe latte can be stronger though.
4
Coffee was great, service was good, food was great! Price is a bit on the high side, but still worth going again
5
Excellence Food and Service was Awesome. Food was Great too. Will definitely recommend to friends and relatives.
5
Really nice place to have brunch with Friend. The creamy mushrooms is excellent and the waffles is totally recommended to everyone.
5
Parking is a hassle since there's hardly any parking nearby. However, the food and atmosphere does compensate that inconvenience.
4
Lovely ambience with quality food! Went there on a weekend so it was bustling with patrons. Note that you will have to make your order and payment at the cashier, and they didnt charge service tax so fair enough :)
4
Had the farmer's pasta but was a little salty. However i would recommend the truffle fries cause it's really good and worth the money!
2
Food was great however service was terrible. Was just putting my last mouthful of scrambled eggs and the waitress ran over wanting to clear my plate immediately but I was clearly not done yet. I was still chewing on my food when I had to answer her. Terrible space as wewere given a table beside the counter tops and waitresses kept squeezing through the little space to and fro making my appetite horrible
4
It was great that the cafe accepts reservation even on a Sunday. Although seats were limited, but we will ushered to our table the moment we arrived. It didn't take long for the food to arrive. Food portions were huge. Although food was pricey, but considering there was no service charge and that we purchased a chop $50 voucher at 10% voucher, it was a good deal! Food was tasty.
5
The place is highly accessible near Botanic Gardens MRT Station. Reservation is highly recommended if you do not want to wait for between 15-30 minutes for a seat on a weekend. The food portion was generous as well. However, the place was quite noisy during my visit (can't be help)
4
The place was nice but on a weekend it was slightly more crowded, a bit too much to have a chat with friends over a coffee. Best to visit on weekdays.
5
Good mushrooms on toast! Waffles were yummy as well. Liked the desserts too! Good catch up with friends :)
3
This place serves homey and wholesome food. But the whole cafe's acoustic is bad. It makes the whole place really noisy and difficult to have a good chat. Friendly and helpful staff.
5
Delicious croissant and warm scrambled eggs, good coffee and an ambience alive with people from all age brackets ! Service was prompt, cheerful (even early in the morning) and helpful. Best of all - free streetside parking !
4
What I liked is that the food did not take too long to come, and all my food arrived almost at the same time. Also, it is a lovely environment to dine and chill in.
4
Food was interesting and served rather quickly despite running on full house. However, the arrangement of tables was too close to each other hence there isn't much space between separate groups of diners. Decor was wonderful too. Overall a splendid experience!
4
I love the ambience of atlas coffeehouse, feels very homely when I stepped into it. The staffs there were friendly as well! Thank you for serving yummy food! Will definitely go back there again
4
Really love the ambience of the cafe, from the minimalistic walls to the welcoming vibe. The service was great as well, with friendly and approachable staff. Prices here are on the steep side, with main courses >$15 on average but fortunately I had a $30 chope voucher that managed to lighten the damage to my wallet. Ordered 2 mains and a waffle for dessert among the 2 of us. The cereal prawn pasta was really good, though a tad oily, the crisp cereal crumbs and wok-hei fragrance was a delight to the palate! The waffles were one of the better ones out there too, a crisp exterior with a soft, fluffy interior coupled with a buttery lingering fragrance of the batter. The matcha waffles that I ordered also came with a scoop of matcha ice-cream and matcha caramel sauce, decent but not for the hardcore matchaholics.
4
Our group enjoyed the overall experience of this coffeehouse, as well as the service and ambience. Things that stood out were the great pancakes and waffles, along with the french fries and pasta dishes. Coffee was also very well done, the latte well crafted, with a lovely latte art design to boot.
4
Came on a Sunday at noon. Place was buzzing!Service was pleasant and prompt.Creamy mushrooms on sourdough - huge portion with creamy scrambled eggs, although tasted quite dull halfway through.Bacon, Beans and Sausage - big portion, tasty. Summer chicken stew - Sauce and veg were good, but chicken dry and tasteless on its own.Cereal prawn pasta - Tasty enough, but portion very small.Waffles - the highlight of the meal! Light and crispy on outside, fluffy on the inside.Key Lime Pie - Just the right amount of sweetness and tartness.Cappuccino was good. I'd visit again just to have the waffles
5
Ordered the Creamy Mushroom and Stew Chicken Leg, portion was big so did not try the other side dishes. Will definitely go back. Thumbs Up Café!
5
Great food. Really liked the truffle fries, coffee, keylime pie and waffles. They even have baby chair in the cafe.
5
Service was fast and attentive! We spilled water and before we could get napkins, they came over quickly and cleaned up for us! Scrambled eggs was quite on point although the sourdough was really hard.
5
Went with family on Christmas Eve. Good service, prompt and efficient... food was great! Love the waffles as always. Left stuffed and happy.
4
We shared the chicken summer stew and the cabonara. The menu has been expanded to include more lunch options. The chicken was very tender. Cabonara was on the creamier side and hence a little too rich.
5
really love their brunch options and ambience of the place. just a slight walking distance from botanic mrt
4
Had the cereal prawn pasta which was a bit too oily for my liking and the mushroom sourdough which was very filling. Portion sizes are quite generous.
4
We were there for brunch n the place was rather packed for a weekday. The fish n kale is delicious n the summer chicken stew is creamy n satisfying.
3
Eggs tasted like rubber tbh and chicken stew was average. In the end the photos looked great but did not reflect the quality of the food
4
This isn't your run of the mill breakfast place. The menu does include regular items like pancake and waffles, but it also serves soba noodles, chicken stew and beef brisket, for your breakfast.Its great for groups who have folks who like sweet and and some who like savoury as there is something for everyone. The portions are large, and very filling. I particularly liked the soba noodles with poached salmon - wonderfully done and fresh. They are famous for their fluffy pancake - which is so fluffy it looks like cake. Its a little too cake like for me, and a tad too sweet but this looks like a popular item in the restaurant. Quality of coffee was good, and waffles were above average too. This is a pretty small place so it gets crowded very quickly and its not a place to linger as the tables are set pretty close together
3
Ordered Creamy Mushroom on Sourdough and Atlas Hash. Atlas Hash was extremely disappointing. Not sure if that is their standard or because it's weekends, hence standard not as per usual. The environment is too noisy and tables were too close for comfort.
4
Coffee was good and the texture of the scrambled eggs was one of the better ones ard. the creamy tomatoes were cooked with tomatoes which makes the dish not too jelat. Would recommend dishes here for sharing instead. Banana pancakes would be a must-try!!
4
Great place and service staff. Excellent coffee and food. A tad too cold. But the food and coffee is great
5
The food at Atlas coffeehouse is really good with a price that is so worthwhile. The chicken stew was the bomb. Everyone should never missed it.
3
We absolutely love the candied bacon waffles and atlas hash breakfast. Flat white is legit too. Only weird thing was the server but nothing fatal. Also not very big if you have stroller or need children's seats.
4
The food is good and portion is big. Worth the time and money.
However, some of the food items when received are cold.
4
Tried this place as recommended by a friend. We had brunch here for 3 pax and booked through Chope. It was a fuss free reservation. The food here is delicious, and pancakes were great!! We had the signature pancakes and we love the thick pancake that they serve. Dont pour the additional honey in as it's sweet on its own already. We had the mains of salmon soba (the skin could be crispier though), farmers pasta (the combination of the flavours were good!), and the pulled pork sourdough(not bad only). Coffee is the usual, not exceptional. The space is quite tall and hollow and can get quite noisy when it's crowded. Otherwise, the service is prompt and friendly. We will return for the pancakes!
4
Do make reservations in advance before visiting! There's no doubt the food were really good! They were served in generous portion and even though there weren't service charge, the staffs were prompt and warm. Only gribe is they are really crowded and place is a little cramp. But I'll revisit anytime again
4
Glad I brought my friend to have breakfast at atlas . It was her first visit and she took an instant liking to both the cosy ambience and the delicious food. Portion was big. Both of us shared the creamy mushroom sourdough (my favourite) and the pulled pork . The meal was complete with latte !
5
There was a wait for this place when I went for Sunday Lunch, there are seats outside and an iPad taking queue numbers. I liked the food here, proper work went into the flavours, and its in a spot not too far from home. Would come back
5
Service staff greeted me with a smile, and when I left also thanked me loudly as i walked out. Very friendly!
5
The food is GREAT and reasonably priced. Most of the staff was friendly. Menu is extensive but the cake selection could be improved.
5
The range of buttermilk waffles was good. The waffles were well done. Crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside!
5
A nice place for catch up, nice fluffy pancake and good coffee. For 2 ladies, the pancake was bog enough for sharing. Had pull pork sandwich and it was good too.
4
Service is very good,the food is nice although I only try the waffle,price for waffle is reasonable.
5
Didn't know what to expect before going but turned out a great experience. Excellent food! Service was not bad considering how busy it was on a Sunday. Will definitely visit again.
4
Tried the chicken stew and shroom :-) it was really creamy but pretty salty to me! The food come in quite big portion so I think it will be good to share! The cold brew was ok, not too bitter. Went on a Saturday after around 1.45pm and it was crowded

Very few places makes a good piccolo and this is one of the gems in Bukit Timah area. Sound insulation is not great when it gets crowded, but coffee is ALWAYS good or they will make it again for you. Eat here a few times work friends and it was always good. Cheery service with great smile. My fav dish was the quinoa was pumpkin spinach and chicken. The pull pork burger was also good. You get guilty treats and healthy options. Great for hanging out and chilling with friends be of weekdays or weekends. Closed on Mon... So don't go there on Mondays!!

Pulled pork was too salty. The scrambled egg saved the dish. 2.5/5Matcha Waffle was good. Crunchy and not too sweet unlike many others. Those biscuit bits were fantastic. 4/5Truffle fries. Fried to perfection. Crispy, generous portion of shaved Parma. Slightly more Truffle oil and I'll give it a 5.Mocha 4/5. Loved the fact dark chocolate was used. However I felt it overpowered the coffee abit too much.Would definitely come back agai

The latest in-place for locals in Bukit Timah to hangout, Atlas' laidback Aussie vibe, coupled with freshly prepared food and efficient service, makes it a cool place to chill out and watch the world go by. Food is a little on the pricey side and not the most innovative - but it's fresh and unpretentious. And the young earnest and efficient staff are an added plus.Highly recommended dish - salmon sob
