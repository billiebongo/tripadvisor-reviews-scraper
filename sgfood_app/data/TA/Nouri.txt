The vibe was good, the atmosphere was warm and each staff took pride in explaining each dishes that was served.
However price to food value ratio, i believe either the ingredients could be improved or perhaps a much better price point.

7 veg soup was good but everything else was average. Mushroom was better than fish. Dessert was interesting (savoury and sweet) but could be disconcerting for some. Note 5 charge for free flow still or sparking ‘in house’ water, they don’t serve iced water

The food in Nouri is prepared very differently that retain the original ingredients. The service is also excellent.

Interesting place. Food was good. Had the fish and it was excellent. Service was good as well. Worth coming back again

Decided on chef's seasonal degustation menu instead of the usual dinner menu. Did not disappoint. Interesting use of ingredients and plating of food was pretty. Loved the burrata, medium rare black pork and salmon dishes. Dessert was unimpressive though. The marshmallow and chocolate on a biscuit was very ordinary. Could not really catch what the soft spoken pastry chef was saying when she was introducing the dishes. But otherwise, service is good.

Visited for lunch. There are three set meals for lunch - a fish, meat and vegetarian. Today we ordered the mushrooms. The mushrooms were meaty with an unusual dandelion sauce. Served with kohlrabi and barley risotto on the side. The mushrooms were delicious as was the risotto. Desert was a sorbet with mandarin. My second visit and the food was as interesting as ever. Definitely a good option for lunch. However do ensure that you get a table rather than the counter.

I visited this cosy restaurant twice in 2 weeks for different occasions and I found them enjoyable. The first occasion was a wedding anniversary celebration and the second one was a friend gathering.The menu was pretty much the same during the two visits, which gave me more opportunity to the experience and understand the thought that was put behind the cuisine. The format of the dinner experience was degustation with the choice of 5 or 8 course.The place has a mix of romanticism and funkiness; it reminded me of a lighter and younger version of Odette. The communal high table and the open kitchen where all food was prepared in the same space of the patrons typified the philosophy of togetherness interaction, and nourishment through the dinning experience.Food was bold, rustic, balanced, and flavoursome that showcased the ingredients. On the second visit I was able to taste the flavour in more details and not be overwhelmed by the wow factors.I found the service was adequate rather than outstanding; I found the enthusiasm was more abundant in our first visit while in the second time as a returning guest I would expect a higher engagement but that was lacking from chef Ivan and staff. Further I found the walk through of each dish in the second round was more concise and missed some of the more interesting background (e.g., the reason behind the choice of ingredients and background of the chef). Otherwise this could be a happier place.Overall this is a refreshing concept and an enjoyable experience

dropped by for lunch one of the days and ordered the set lunch which consists of the grouper fish as a main and it comes with 4 different sides including a vegetable broth made from 7 different vegetables which was one of the best i tried in a long tim

The food is one of the most creative that I have ever had. The staff accommodates your dietary restrictions in a smooth manner. Reservations in advance is mostly a must especially over the weekends. They do fusions in a way that is tough to explain but a pleasure to taste. Must go

Been itching to dine at Nouri for some time given what I have read/heard - The place did not disappoint. Service was of a high quality and so was the food. You can choose between ala carte or set menu - Interestingly they also had a “surprise” set menu wherein there was no menu - Thus the “surprise.” We chose this and paired it with some good wines. Each course was explained in detail and was a fantastic journey!Loved the restaurant itself and the atmosphere - The kitchen is integrated with the dining room and we elected to perch ourselves on the “kitchen bench” that run along one side of the room!One down side - The place is expensive … As a one-off/special occasion it’s worth the stretch but you have been warned

Its been a while that a restaurant delights and surprises and Nouri managed to do so. Good service in an inviting environment (i.e. not those stifling restaurant where one is afraid to even laugh loudly).

These restaurant is one of the best restaurant I experience in Singapore. I have been very impressed in the last 3 days with the quality and the selection of the restaurant and Nouri is one of them

It was good food, well represented and nice service but it is not worth putting your credit card down for a reservation. Plenty of places that serve food this good.I had fish for lunch and it was just average good. Nothing to be raving about.Won’t go back for some time

Attentive service albeit the food was a bit slow to come. Charged $5 per head for tap water which was not made known to us at the point of ordering (was listed in wine menu which we didn’t even open because we didn’t order wine). They did waive the charge after we brought this up (but didn’t tell us they waived it). So...great restaurant ....just brush up on communication skills! (Charging $5 for tap water is a separate issue which I’ll leave alone for now ...!

Nouri-sh me and my guests...and that they did. And very well indeed. We had the more expensive Omakase lunch and it was a pure delight. Every dish was carefully prepared and very refreshing to the taste buds with such original and a creative mix of ingredients. The wine were quite reasonably priced as well. In all a great experience

At Nouri, Chef Ivan Brehm is in his element. The food here is even more interesting than it was in Bacchanalia. The restaurant is thoughtfully designed, with geometric lamps, warm lighting and soothing art of birds. We were given a table in the thick of the action. We felt as if we were in an episode of Chef’s Table. Every item of the 7-course dinner menu came with a story, with the first story being told by the warm and personable Chef Ivan. The idea of Nouri is of food that spans cultures and gives a sense of our common humanity, From the 7-veg broth to the Brazilian curry, the mushrooms, and the steak with buah keluak, every item blended the different with the familiar. Service was very good. Some of the staff were charming and everyone was enthusaufc, Don’t miss the biodynamic wines and sake

Ivan, Matthew and the team have managed to conjure up a one of a kind balance of approachability, ambience, education and truly inspiring food which is almost impossible to come by. Each and every exquisite flavor was explained with passion and a solid knowledge of the provenance of almost every ingredient.The masterful way that flavours where intertwined in unique combinations again truly inspiring..We have eaten around the globe and this evening at Nouri will be with us for many years.Our only criticism would be that the Wine list needs a few offerings that appeal to the more cost conscious.Especially in order to get repeat customers.

This was my second time at Nouri. We went for dinner (last time was at lunch). I wanted to try dinner. We arrived at 1900 on a Saturday evening. Chef Ivan wasn't around that evening. Service during the meal was efficient and good. Great food and ambiance. Great cocktails and the food was exceptional. Wine was also interesting. However they really couldn't sort out the bill at the end - it took ages and we had to remind them to come. Clearly they were busy at the end of the service but the final experience spoilt what should have been a rating of 5 (which was my previous rating) ... sorry

An amazing experience, relatively new in Singapore although Chef Ivan has first class experience in top restaurants. This will be challenging for a place in the world's Top 100.Enjoyed the 3 hat Chefs Table in New York recently and loved this more because of Ivan's interaction and passion for ensuring the diners have a wonderful total experience. He and his team bring the food personally and explain the source and cooking of each course.A wonderful diverse menu with the best produced sourced from many places - beautifully prepared and wonderfully presented.As good a meal as you will ever have and worth every $.Only a small restaurant , perhaps 18 or 20 seats but this enhances the appeal as it gives a touch of intimacy

Given the number of new restaurants in Singapore and the number that fail to make the grade we were very happy with our night out at Nouri.The restaurant was quite small ( I am guessing about 16-20 seats ) and the experience is first rate after taking a seat. And it should be since it is not cheap.I am no food gourmet expert but we all found the food interesting, a bit different , not too much and of course delicious. Each course is explained in detail either by Chef Ivan or one of the enthusiastic team. So much detail in fact that it was difficult to take it all in ! A range of flavours too. From SE Asia to Brazil...The culinary experts among us were picking out the flavours as we ate... so good for conversation over dinner!The wine list was a bit limited and I was told because they source from mainly organic producers. Our first choice was a Hungarian white (Holdvolgy) which I wasn't a huge fan of. It wasn't crisp enough for my taste. For the red we asked for a recommendation and the choice was excellent. An Italian Conus Lagrein Riserva. Highly recommended.The bill was >$1,000 for 4 (inc 2 bottles). So come armed with credit card(s)
