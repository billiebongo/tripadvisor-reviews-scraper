The great food is prepared with lots of effort and the ambience is good for chilling out. The staff are very warm and informative for the dishes served up! It's awesome to know what I'm eating :D
4
We have a great time as the food are very good, the staffs are friendly. the location is convenient as well. they don't open for weekend.
5
Food quality was super amazing, surprised for something that is 'fast food'. Super crowded though at lunches, but they try and sort it by giving you table numbers and sort seating.
Definitely a great place for lunch if you're around the area
4
Tried to reserve a table for lunch but Chope said no availability - I suppose reservations for lunch are not allowed. Place was packed to the gills and you eat cheek by jowl with other diners.However the food was good. I had the hickory smoked salmon with black sticky rice - very good. Didn't intend to finish the rice but I did. Companions's kaisen don (salmon on rice) was also very good - but they had mistakenly packed it in a plastic bowl thinking he wanted it to go (he didn't). This was strange since I, the other diner in the same party, was not having it to go.Snafu aside, would return. At an off peak hour
5
I thoroughly enjoyed my visit to NUDE seafood. Each of their dishes have a creative twist to them and are really value for money! I particularly enjoyed their octopus, ocean trout, and dark chocolate dishes. Job well done! Staff were prompt and cheerful. Pleasant experience and will highly recommend this place

NUtritious & DElicious affordable fine-dining seafood dinner. Started with the Baby Squid / Manila Clams. Main entree were the Golden Pomfret / Ocean Trout. Then enter the Pre-Dessert - Chef's Creation. Pre-Dessert was not enough and too little!! We also had the Main (Vegetarian) Dessert - Polar Bear / Mango, Coconut, & Thai Basil / Chocolate, Blueberry, & Thyme. A 4-course meal which deserves a very empty stomach by skipping lunch. Meals were served fast and orderly. Waitress even briefed us on what we were eating.
3
main were very disappointing esp for the price we paid. only saving grace was the scallop and squid starter. will not revisit
3
we had the $49++ dinner set. the food was ok, the portion were pretty small though. overall, nothing to write home about
5
We ordered the dinner set and each dish was absolutely delicious - with the freshest of ingredients and mix of flavours that complement!One thing to note though, my friends and I thought the Bowl of green tea ramen was actually not needed. Perhaps the restaurant could consider that to be optional instead
5
Excellent value and food. We took a set (4 course) and enjoyed it very much. The food was very innovative with a different intrepretation of a normal dish. We had swordfish cervice, it was served along with cucumber sorbet. Very unique. We also had the hokkaido scalop and enjoyed it very much.Will recommend this place to everyone i kno
5
Selected menu but everything is cooked to perfection. Nude magic - the cold espresso with cream is a really nicely made coffee, latte is great too.
5
Excellent food quality in terms of both taste and presentation. Good value for money too. And service is exemplary
5
NUDE Seafood. Nude Seafood serves delicious and affordable seafood dishes and hearty meals. They offer Barramundi Roasted, Duck Rillettes, Grilled King Prawns and many more. Come and visit them with your friends and family!
5
I wish to invite my business guest to the restaurant. I am confident that it is one of best seafood in bay area!
5
It was my first time to Nude after reading a review online and I'm glad that I've made the choice. The staff was friendly and alert. Food was amazing. The dishes we had were fresh and tasty. I look forward to new selections on the menu
5
Went on a business dinner here during August. I had no expectations before going but was blown away by the experience. I have eaten at some excellent restaurants across Europe and this place would be right up there with the best. Choice, flavour, service, presentation and taste all fantastic. I had the prawns start and red snapper main, both of which were superb. I was with a party of 12 so we pretty much explored the whole menu between us and EVERYBODY was delighted. I even had a mango dessert ( not being a dessert person) and it was superb too. Just go , its excellent
5
This place is the best if you're looking for seafood. The quality of the food has against all odds managed to improve upon what I thought was already perfection since the last I was here. I had the Singapore mullet with tonnarelli and it was divine. The meat was tender, the skin crispy. My friends had the ocean trout and the flower grouper, both of which I tasted. The trout was melt-in-your-mouth delicious and the broth of the grouper was light and refreshing. The service was also excellent and I loved the fact that the waiters explained the dishes to us upon serving them. I'm a seafood lover and I've been to plenty of supposedly good seafood places, like no signboard, mellben seafood, michelin starred/celebrity chef restaurants etc. But this place tops them all in terms of quality and value. My only complaint is that why in the world do they not open on weekends and public holidays????? These are the only times I'm more free to enjoy a good meal TT
4
Ordered 3 dinner sets for sharing. Portions were generous so best to share! Seafood were fresh, excellently prepared, with a modern twist.Would have preferred mere options for dessert for the set, maybe 3 choices instead of current 2? Service was fast, attentive, place has a casual vibe and being centrally located at MBFC (Downtown MRT station), it's just a short stroll to Promontory and Marine Bay Sands, and onward to Gardens by the Bay for night views. Wonderful dinner and evening walk. Will be back
4
This is my second time to Nude. Service is good. Food is great. Hope they will have more different varieties next time round. Otherwise it will be sometime later before I re visit this place again. A good place to catch dinner even for tourist. Skip the usual dinning places near Marina Bay Sands. Place is not open on weekends.
1
Coffee is great but it's the lack of service which would stop us going back. The service is only reserved for a small handful of people. I have never come across such ego and arrogance from staff who I thanked but they never even bothered to look at me or acknowledge me, much less say anything other than to call out the coffee I bought..
5
Neat and tight menu with spot on flavour combination. Warm and satisfying plus works great for group
5
An all seafood restaurant.
Fish is very fresh as it is delivered from the fish wholesaler daily.
Innovative menu and well priced
5
Will definitely go back. A solid 5 star. The food is superb and staff very friendly. If you are looking for a relaxed and casual dining, highly recommend this place.
5
The service staff was very attentive and took the effort to explain every dish that they served and how to eat it. Very immaculate service for every visit that I went. The food just gets better and better.
5
I had the barramundi and swordfish belly and both were fresh and delicious. Love the fish - chipped walls too.
4
Great spot for lunch. Japanese influence. Small portions but delicious.
Quick. Perfect for business lunch.
4
Food good, ordered ocean trout, Think it's good.Ambience okay, a little warm for me, and there is smell of food around, seems to be a nice place for couplesService okay, not bad but not fantasti
5
I decided to give place a shot after reading a couple of reviews online. It seemed to be a nice cozy place to have a meal and boy was I blown away by the food and the service. The food was impeccably prepared and delicious, the plating reminiscent of costlier establishments and the service was excellent, the explanation for each dish. Definitely a place deserving of a returning visit!
5
Amazing for office lunch and they also have vegetarian option. I generally don't like cooked fish but their salmon and cod are amazing, and i often order their barachirashi :) always wanted to go for their dinner as it also looks super delicious
5
We visited after hearing about nude seafood from a friend, and it well exceeded our expectations.The setting was modern and clean, comfortable and relaxed.The seafood was delicious, the wine list and pairings were simple but hit the mark, the service was attentive and quick, and the price was surprisingly low for the location and quality of our experience.We ordered the set menu ($45pp for the courses) and were delighted with every dish.The staff were friendly while remaining respectful.The only negative was that we found the restaurant a little tricky to locate, tucked away at the bottom of the commercial building above
5
Simple elegant food that's fresh and tasty. Friendly staff. A pity that that they don't serve coffee after 5pm. It would gone well with the desserts.
4
Food was great! Although the interior of the place seems abit old fashioned but hey, when the food came it was a total surprise!
5
Been there twice and was never disappointed. The quality of the food is great with great service by the staff. Enjoyed the meal and would definitely visit it again.
5
The food portion was really generous. Service was excellent and the atmosphere was great. Overall I would come back for.
3
I had Uni and Prawn pasta for lunch. It was full of flavour and very tasty but disappointingly small portion. Japanese Influence and very casual atomosphere
5
6 of us Tried all the main course selections. Focus on delivering a selected set of mains means each dish is truly unique and well thought through.
5
I've been lucky to get the opportunity to eat at Nude at least once a week for the past 6 months (when I was working right next door). Nude is the ONLY restaurant in Singapore that I will truly miss, now that I've leaving town for good. Their food is delicious and fresh. They have an outstanding customer service and all their staff are extremely attentive, accommodating and friendly. Of course, their Fantastic atmosphere can't be forgotten. If you're ever around, make sure you get in their and enjoy a meal or two. They have different menus for lunch and dinner. Both are truly exceptional and at affordable prices
5
Nude is located on the ground floor street level next to MOS Burger. I was recommended to try this eatery nearby the office and took an early dinner trip to a relatively light crowd on a weekday with my wife... I'd been during lunch and the system they employed of no table reservations a more evolved one in the city where the lunch crowd is heavy...~during lunch you queue first and someone will ask if you wanna eat in, before you order they show you where a table is reserved with a "Letter" on a card & tell you to remember the "Letter". You order at one of the 2 counters and get a pager, then a table with the exact number of seats you need is found for you to sit and when your pager is buzzed you go collect your food at the counter. No worries many ordering are taking out or collecting to go~lunch ordering is fast and fun... guys really fun crew behind the counter will put you at ease yet move the queue quickly along~during dinner in a more relaxed environment they will provide table wait service and the tableside chat is enjoyable and attentiveLunchBara Chirashi Bowl is SUPER YUMz x3 mix this up for a spoonful of bursting tastinessHickory-Smoked Salmon the grains here is flavorful and I polished them off easily YUMzDinnerHokkaido Scallop Carpaccio oh this is YUMzPan-Roasted Whole Barramundi Fillet isn't very whole but a mite baby small for non Asian tastesChilean Seabass Roulade served with the tomato broth separately does indeed look like a fish fingerIberico de Bellota Pork, Presa de Paleta has a potato foam that isn't foamy but is absolutely delicious YUMzgotta point out that the crew here really have fun working and they rub off on the dinersI was here 3 times 2016Jun NOTE there are no onsite restrooms at the restaurant and you gotta head out to the building locate the Workspace expresso bar diagonally across the foyer, walk into a stairwell and climb up to the mezzanine where they are locate

We had the set dinner for $48 per person and ordered 2 different white wine. The crispy squid was really nice. We also ordered mussels but unfortunately we had a couple of mussels gone bad and it affected the entire bowl, so we had to change it to a duck dish which was good. We had the Miso swordfish belly which was very tasty, but only one piece was a belly and the 2nd piece of fish was not as soft. The sauce of the prawn pasta was distinctly different and unique in taste and I enjoyed that very much. Overall, the entire experience was good
5
First time visit with friends for dinner. The food was perfect, especially the smoke salmon! After the meal, we were served with two bowls of imported fruits! We were so surprised, and we guess it must be because I am the birthday girl~ :))Although just in few quantity, but the fruits were so sweet and juicy!
5
Had to change my reservation a few times but the team kindly accommodated and even advised me to place advance orders as some items on the menu tend to run out. Staff was extremely attentive as well. Great place for a dinner after work!
5
My 2nd time back at this place and it's well worth it. This time for its Winter Feast. Portion is quite overwhelming for the mains. Other than that, everything is wonderful. Will be back again soon!
4
Chefs seem to be very proud of their dishes (and very validly so!). Good service, good food. Interesting fusion flavours. Good value for money.
5
I like how NUDE Seafood always review their menu options often! It makes me want to go back to keep trying out new dishes, and their dishes are always of superb quality! 👍🏻 Keep up the good work!

Have been here a couple of times, with colleagues.I can see why this place gets packed during lunch time, since their delicious one-dish meal enables fast turn around time.The first time , my colleague recommended their Snapper ($23) which was grilled to perfection and accompanied by quinoa with cured duck and vegetables. The second time, I tried their hickory smoked salmon at a decent price of $17. They serve their salmon grilled with purple cabbage, with a side of interesting grains which they term '"forbidden". This was drizzled with ponzu-olive oil.Both times, I was pleasantly surprised how such healthy but quickly prepared 'fast' seafood can actually be delectable.My colleague tried their Inaniwa Udon and unagi ($19) which is grilled eel with udon, cordycep mushroom, as well as mixed vegetable tempura, and enjoyed it too.Another colleague tried their Uni and Prawn pasta ($24) which is prawn paired with squid ink tonnarelli pasta and potato strings, drizzled with sea urchin sauce, and proclaimed it tasty.Dishes were simply, but still pleasingly presented.This was a lunch for which there were no guilty feelings thereafter, since it was light yet adequate.Highly recommended if one is craving for wholesome, yet tasty seafood without feeling any post-lunch slumber, especially for those who work around this area.Come early or late, to avoid the long lunch time queues.HelenSingapor

Recommended by my cousin to come here.Packed for lunch and they dont do reservations for lunch. Logical given the lunch crush on Mon to Friday.Superclean, not fussy.Chill envrionment.More importantly food was clean and not fussy and superbly tasty leveraging on fresh ingredients and good cooking from.the kitchenDoesnt cost an arm and a legWill return for a dinner when less crowded
3
Service is great!The lady at the register noticed I was pregnant, and made sure my needs were met. She asked to if I wanted my fish well done. She asked if I wanted to remove the egg from salad. I didn't have to ask for anything! Unexpected great service!Food is good.The salmon/grain dish I ordered was good, but the portion was fairly small, and dish was one dimensional. Literally just cabbage in the salad/slaw. Felt $17 for just rice/cabbage/small filet of fish was overpriced.Ambience is loud.My husband and I could barely hear each other sitting across a small table from each other. We were talking in each others faces most of the time, and we basically left the conversation until we got out of the restaurant.
5
Had a wonderful dinner experience in my recent visit with 2 other girlfriends for a special occasion. The waiters were very courteous and helpful. Our waiter explained each course served and were attentive without being intrusive. Food we ordered were fresh and delicious. Will recommend it to others. The only drawback is the open kitchen concept, which means the cooking smell may stay on you after dinning.
4
Affordable good quality dining options are rare in the CBD. I had dinner here with a girlfriend and we really enjoyed the great food and the unhurried dining atmosphere - at dinner the restaurant doesn't have the hustle and bustle / din that you encounter at lunchtime.I had the King Prawn pasta with chorizo which was very tasty and something I would order again. I love that they give you a wine pairing option for each dish which makes dining feel a little more special. Kudos to this gem in Marina Bay Financial Center.
5
Simple restaurant with great delicious food for lunch and dinner. Not too pricy. Good service. For lunch, do go early as it tends to get crowded after 12:30. Highly recommend the Hickory Smoked Salmon for lunch, Barramundi for lunch and dinner. Do try some of the desserts as well
5
The visit was pleasant and the services were good. The staffs are professional and knowledgeable. Will visit them again (:
4
The interior is very nice, modern Scandinavian/American design. Food is prepared well and served well. Prices are OK
5
Simple to the eyes but definitely lots of work to come up with healthy delicious meals with seafood platters
5
It is a consistently good place for lunch unless you are looking for something inexpensive and quiet. Make sure you avoid rush hour.
5
Love the prawn uni pasta and salmon for lunch. Also love the pure coconut water. Simply awesome. Just need to queue during lunch otherwise it's fine. My favorite lunch corner.
5
Stumbled across this vibrant restaurant for lunch and were very pleasantly surprised. Great small menu with extremely fresh and well thought-out dishes. Staff were incredibly friendly and helpful. We will certainly return next time we're in Singapore!
5
I've been to Nude a total of 4 times now and the food has been outstanding every time. Even though it's mostly known as a super popular lunch spot, I think their dinner service should be commended as well. Fancy enough for a special event yet casual enough for a regular weeknight dinner, Nude's simple but well thought out menu had something for everyone in our party.I had the cod which was paired with the most amazing tomato broth, and tried the Iberico pork and barramundi off my friends' plates. Everything was tender and perfectly cooked. The fritto misto is my favorite starter (although they're all very good) and the Irish oysters were super sweet. The panna cotta is a great way to end the meal. Nude also offers an affordable range of wines to choose from ($12-$16 per glass). All the friends I've taken there love the food, and I would definitely go back to Nude again
4
Wasn't a very happy start intitally, when the service staff: 1) took our orders then came back to say that there's only one portion of pasta left ( it was like 745pm)2) there wasn't any flexibility to adjust the menu abit to suit to their lack of ingredients ( eg prawns was sold out etc), so we thought perhaps we can have a salmon version etc3) We wanted to order half a doz of oysters, but they said they are only left with 5 oysters (at 745 / 8pm) and we asked how will they charge, they wanted to charge us One single oyster with 2 pair of oyster charge which was pricier than the half doz. End up after we made some noise on the pasta choices and the oysters and they tried to adjust and accomodate to us for the lack of ingredients and offered us an appetitser to make up for it.They remmebered my request to have a dessert for a friend who was celebrating her birthday and it was a very yummy choc dessert. Everyone of us sang praises of it.Overall happy after they tried to salvage the situation and the food is indeed nice. :
5
Booked out the restaurant for a private event recently and the good chefs here came up with an off-the-menu three course meal that really impressed us! I thoroughly enjoyed the meal and the socialising in between courses (and may or may not have had a second helping of desert). While speaking to the co-founders, I learnt that the menu was conceptualised based on the transitioning of the season from summer to autumn. Always interesting to know what inspires new dishes! Food aside, the dinner service team was top-notch - they helped with preparing the champagne toast, were attentive to the guests (small but noticeable things like topping up water, replacing utensils quickly etc), kept a look out for those with dietary restrictions despite them constantly switching seats, and did everything with a smile. These guys are pros.Definitely looking forward to my next meal there (
2
I know I know - what isn't overpriced in Singapore? Taxis perhaps but that's it really. But still we ordered one starter to share and two main courses (as we usually do in restaurants) and despite paying top dollar we left hungry. And I don't mean peckish. We were actually hungry and ended up having another dinner. And we are in no way, ekhm, large-bellied so to speak. The food was tasty and served quickly but we couldn't get over the portion sizes... Staff very nice and friendly
4
This was a pleasant meal and the service staff led by Whey Han made it a memorable affair. The dishes were certainly inventive and we enjoyed each one, lovingly presented. We look forward to returning to try their lunch menu.
5
I haven't had a good carbonara in a while. The mushroom and leek carbonara was full of flavour and had abundance of mushrooms(which i love). I enjoyed it very much.
5
Nude Seafood never cease to amaze me with the excellent service, value for money dining, and innovative menu that they change regularly. Recommended dishes are always spot on. Good mix of fresh seafood : from imported oysters to Chilean seabass done in various fusion styles. And lovely desserts - fusion style as well. The quality of the preparation and the presentation is much akin to fine dining, without paying the cost. Great place to bring friends and family for a treat! The simple but warm ambience, quality of food, friendly and attentive service will always bring me back
4
Small selection but excellent menu selection! We tried fresh oysters and rillets as starters! Main courses - fantastic sea bass and barramundi! Home made fresh pasta with ragout and Iberico ballots pork shoulder that taste like duck! Desserts - camomile panacotta - melt in your mouth! Highly recommend this place - at the ground floor of MBFC tower 3! Fantastic young crew and excellent service tonight!
3
Food is average, service is good. Ok place for a good lunch during working hours... Can try if you are around Marina Bay Financial Centre
5
Stumbled upon this gem while visiting Singapore for work. From the onset, it is evident that much effort has been spent in crafting the menu, which features Japanese inspired dishes and high quality ingredients. I especially like the use of ancient grains in the menu (quinoa anyone?). With the help of the friendly server, I decided to go with the Miso-Walnut Snapper and boy was it delicious! The snapper was fresh and nicely grilled and the walnut gave the moist and tender meat an additional crunch. I also liked the quinoa with cured duck, which was flavourful. I finished my lunch with the Hanjuku cheesecake and the raisin sand, which are highly recommended.Overall, Nude is a great option if you would like something simple, affordable and healthy. However, the portion size can be a little bigger though. Will definitely be back again when I am down in Singapore the next time
4
First time here and it was a good experience. Was here for dinner on a Monday and it was fairly full (probably 2 or 3 empty tables). It is a nice and cosy place. The staff were attentive and polite. Ordered the live oysters and pan-roasted barramundi filet. They were both EXCELLENT! The oysters were huge (and luckily I managed to stuff them into my mouth at one go!) Will definitely visit again and try out the other dishes
5
I went with 3 friends and we ordered almost everything on their regular dinner menu to share and nothing disappointed.The highlights for us were the Hokkaido Scallop Carpaccio starter which was refreshing (savour it with the Nori chip they paired it with), the mouthwatering Fritto Misto japanese herring and calamari starter, the housemade pastas that were made to perfection, Iberico De Bellota Pork main which had a very interesting texture and a super kickass potato foam side, Chamomile Panna Cotta dessert and Ginga Kogen beer!Attentive, friendly service staff and well thought out dishes. Will definitely be back again! :
5
Love Nude's new dinner! Big change from their casual lunch, it's now an elegant, cosy place serving live oysters, Hokkaido scallops, Chilean bass, and iberico de bellota pork for dinner. Prices still remain very reasonable, from $14 for starters and $20 for mains. These guys obviously love what they do, and do it with flair
5
Was jam packed at lunch so decided to try the place out for dinner. Excellent gourmet food for not so expensive prices. The scallop started was excellent as well as the baramudi! Will be bac
4
This was a very different food experience for me. The food was surprising and surprisingly tasty. I also want to draw attention to the great staff - they have a particularly effective way of getting you a table at lunch time.
5
5 dollars for a superb coffee
Full breakfast is expensive but good quality
Lunch is a similar experience
4
Simple fare of healthy carbs and nicely grilled fish. Portions are slightly small, but the food is tasty and light, so you will be sure to finish every bit of it.
5
Healthy combination of seafood - western with an Asian twist. The coffee here is strong and good! The service is also great - all people have a smile and definitely my fav. joint in Singapore near my office.
5
Love everything about this place, the people & food!
Interior looks fresh, music selection is awesome!
Look forward to coming back again.
Well done!
4
The good people at NUDE has got the recipe correct right down every detail. A warm and cosy interior for a good meal and bolstered by a good selection of drinks to complement a meal. Attentive service staff listen and anticipate the needs of the diner. As for the food, I had the privilege to try out about 5 to 6 of their dishes which is constantly refreshed by the chefs. Fresh ingredients, with a lot of thought put in on creative flavoring that makes you want to come back for more to experience it again. Would definitely recommend others to check it out
5
I have been here for dinner 4 times (salmon, prawn, cod in miso, barramundi) and each meal was cooked to perfection. I loved the Cod cooked in Miso (not the exact name and not in their menu anymore) where the softness and taste of the fish melts in your mouth. The Barramundi on the other hand has just the right amount of crunchiness outside and softness in the inside. They really know how to cook their seafood well! Kudos to the team. I just want to add that their service and coffee are great too! I miss their brownies though, they should bring them back :)
5
This unassuming spot in the business area was an total delight. While we did not have a reservation, we were given a table quickly and from the fusion fruit drinks to the Chilean Sea Bass and short ribs, we were treated to an unforgettable cross between nouveau cuisine and an upmarket sushi bar. The ambiance was clean and simple without a lot of crowd noise, and we soon forgot that we were in a restaurant on the ground floor of a large business complex. The prices were just as delightful as the food leaving us room in the budget for some tasty desserts as well. At the end of dinner, the co-founder, Mr. Tan Whey Han, gave us his personal welcome and we will most definitively be back for more on our next trip to Singapore
5
I have been to this place numerous times as it is very near where I work. Although the price of food is above your average cost of lunch, to me it was value for money for the quality of food served. The running of the place is also very efficient as the turnover of tables is usually quick and prompt. You never have to wait too long for a table. Most of the time you will have your table ready for you after you are done making your order and paying. I love the freshness of the food and the great taste. Thus I keep coming back. I usually bring colleagues here for farewell lunches or work friends that I have not met for a long time. I wish they would open more outlets in a non cbd area. I love the "art" on the wall which are sharks or big fish if you look closer. Excellent place. Definitely recommend.
2
Great healthy option but don't ask them for anything slightly off menu like just grilling the fish without any sides. You get the 'no' without any reason given. Lazy rule following.
