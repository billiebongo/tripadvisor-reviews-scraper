Came here for a department Chinese New Year dinner, food was pretty good, private venue on the second floor was big enough to sit 200.

Delectable fresh seafood dishes with top-grade service. Restaurant interior is clean and not overly decorated. Dishes took a little while to be served, but the presentation and taste made up for it. Try the bamboo clam and lobster noodles for a delicious and filling treat!

Stumbled onto this restaurant by chance, as the more well known Tung Lok Restaurant, also in Orchard Parade Hotel was fullThe food was good. Besides the Dim Sum, standout dishes included Braised Duck, Fried Mee Sua, & Spinach with century eggsService was attentive, prices reasonable, & place not overly crowded or noisyRecommended

Restaurant decor is simple and rather bare. Pretty quiet when we went for dinner on a Wednesday night. The fish skin, mock goose and steamed soon hock fish were standouts. Other dishes - steamed prawns, bamboo clams, bitter gourd, sliced beef with kai lan - were of decent standard. Reasonable cost at around SGD60 per person.

This is an unpretentious restaurant (ie good service and very good food without the attitude and price of certain "fine dining" Chinese restaurants). Wait staff and management are friendly and knowledgeable.Portions are decent. We ordered several dishes and the following stood out: vegetarian goose (8 delectable finely chopped vegetable medley rolls each wrapped with a crispy Beancurd skin), wasabi prawns (fresh crunchy prawns lightly coated with wasabi mayo - one of the best i've had in town), and giant dumpling steamed in lotus leaf (serves four - fine balance of salted egg york, meat and other ingredients underscored by the light scent of the lotus leaf). The fried chicken was also delectable, with the skin so delicately crispy.Planning to be back soon to savour the rest of the menu

I brought 2 Teochew friends and both did not know this to be a Teochew restaurant. Dim sum of Teochew dumpling and Pork Buns were good. The Soo Chye ( Teochew steamed vegetable) was Rudi art. The Lor Ark ( braised Duck) and the desert Orh Nee( yam paste) are highly recommended. My friends were reasonably happy with the food and service

In the happening district with shipping and many varieties of food, this restaurant was rated higher than it should have been. The food came out slowly and was like warm. The portions were small and there is a charge for everything. But the worst part is that it didn't taste any better than a Panda Express you could find on the street corner. Use your money elsewhere

Our first lunch during our 6-day program held at Orchard Parade was at Kam Boat and it was enjoyable for the most part. Their appetizers were great: salted egg prawn balls, kailan topped with pork, seasoned seaweed and their version of vegetarian spring rolls. By the time our main course arrived, we were half-full. The service extended was quick, efficient and couteous for the most part. The place is ideal for big groups as the servings are good for sharing.

We are in on Singapore for two days. We wanted to try a traditional dish, the chili crab. It was tasty! However my area at the table looked like an explosion of sauce. Somebody needs to write a how too guide not to get messy.Very traditional with set dish menus, so go with friends/family

For the family This was a restaurant that my family had chosen for my beloved aunt n uncle 22nd yrs wedding anniversary dinner, and we had the ala carte dinner with 10 different dishes for the night. The chef was very generous with the ingredients thus its tasted very homely. Reservation in advance is a must esp. during festive seasons. Therefore, a table of 13x persons had been reserved for us by the time we arrived. Ambience, traditional Chinese banquet/ restaurant decor. Overall good service but food portion is smaller as compared to last time. It's overpriced given the portion of food. Taste wise still maintain the standard. Except the chicken was too soft but the prawns was excellent n very fresh. *Average spend $900 or mote12x 1x + 1x(vegetarian)All in all a very satisfying and memorable experience. Service speed average. Perhaps due to CNY's.

We had lunch in Kam Boat. This is just below the hotel we were staying. They had an offering of a lauriat served for a minimum of 2. The food was authentic. I love the soup the most... Buddha jump over the fence.
3
The food isn't bad-bad. But there are quite a number of Chinese restaurants (even within the vicinity) that offer better service and quality food for the same price. That sums up my thoughts on my first and last visit here.

Ten days back I was in Singapore. I went to this restaurant. The food was wonderful. Australian Abalone, Scallop, Zhao xin Jiu all very good. Should definitely try these things. The service was also superb.

We stayed at the hotel and this restaurant was convenient after an enjoyable drink at the hotel bar. The food was authentic Chinese, and while it was not as cheap as outside the hotel, the atmophere was relaxed and the food very good.

We weren't very hungry and quite tired having travelled for 20 something hours. The Maitre D seated us and hovered over us waiting for us to order. We asked for more time as we weren't very hungry and that we were looking to share a couple of dishes. She asked if we wanted water to high I replied no. It came anyway, hot! After she had taken our order she showed it one at a time to several other wait staff who sniggered and laughed at our expense. When the food arrived she stood over us as as if we were going to steal the cutlery. Had w not been so tired we would have walked. When I asked for the bill there was a charge for the water which I questioned. The Maitre D seemed to lose her capacity to understand English and was extremely unhappy that I wanted it charged to our room. We visit Singapore regularly.they won't get our custom again

6 of us lunched on 15/Aug/2015. We had the SG50 Celebration Menu. Food was 'ok' for the package they offered. Supervisor Ivy attended to us well.There is, howeve, a bevy of elderly waitresses that needs a drastic paradigm change. They stood around our table, seemingly attentively anticipating our needs. However, even when I topped up my fellow diners' cup with tea, they stood their ground. I would expect that they would have taken over the pouring task from me.And, when I started to use my handphone to snap images of the the SG50 menu (there were 2 offerings, and only in text... not photos of dishes) for future reference with the intention of considering a repeat visit, one of the elderly waitress practically snatched it from my table and ran off with it.I trust your CCTV would have captured what transpired. You can verify my feedback then

Kam Boat Teochew Restaurant is located on ground floor of Orchard Parade Hotel building. Within the air-con interior are round tables and chairs laid out dinner setting for 10 people, but can be adjusted according to the number of persons eating.Teochew foods are different from other chinese foods like Cantonese, or Peking fare.My favourite dishes are: the steamed crab that is served cold Teochew-style, steamed Soon Hock fish served whole and in warm marinade sauce, and other seafood - prawn and lobsters - selected from the aquarium inside the restaurant, if one is prepared to pay for these fresh and live specimens. I also like their meat dishes - stewed in herbs and spices, also the rice, noodles, vegetables, and soup offerings. Recommend to go eat there if in a group, for social eating, rather than go eat alone

If one is driving there, you can park at Tanglin Shopping centre and walk over. It only a 5-10min walk.Dim sum is delicious and tasty. Quite a variety to choose from and close to Cantonese taste. Dried fish skin is a specialty there. It taste especially good and crispy when dipped into the soup. There is also bun with sesame mixed with custard. Food is not oily and suitable for the elderly

Been to this restaurant a few times and even before they shifted to their current location. I would say that this restaurant never fails to deliver, in terms of quality, taste and service. Good selection of dishes and so far, have no complaints to any of the dishes that I've had. Recommended items are their dim sum, cold crab, fried soon hock, lotus leaf rice and of course their soups! One of the veru few places in Singapore that makes excellent chinese soup

I went to Kam Boat on trip to Singapore in February with a group of friends. It's always good to go with a group of friends as you can order. Decent selection of dishes.With of us, we were able to order quite a range of dishes. The cold crab was good, the steamed fish from the tank was good but a but outrageously priced, bean curd hotpot was good too and the spinach with century and salted egg was excellent. Other dishes were pretty run of the mill.Service was reasonable overall. I suppose the way I judge a restaurant is how keen I am to go back and if we look at it from a scale of 1 being never, 5 being ambivalent and 10 being I wish it was tomorrow, Kam Boat would be a 5

we found a fly in our claypot yam teochew rice! NEVER going back there again. They offered a replacement not for free. what was worse was the server when alerted to the fly as she dished it out into bowls covered it with a spoonful of rice and pointed to another part of the surface area. Convinced we saw it we looked underneath and found it ourselves. Dishonesty was the waitress. Ridiculous cheats

Kam Boat is one of those traditional Hong Kong style Cantonese restaurant found in Orchard vicinity. Its not a known place like the Imperial Treasure and Crystal Jade chains but you know what, they serve up good quality cantonese cuisine that reminds me of Hong Kong. Its one of our favourite places to dine when we feel like Cantonese or using one of their private rooms for big family dinners

I stopped going to this restaurant in the old location at Shaw Centre.I was forced to go for yet another reunion dinner. Family persuaded me that food and service had improved and they were right.In spite of the two seatings on the busiest night of the year, service was prompt and efficient, Dishes were served at a good pace, staf paid attention to requests for chilli padi, hot water to drink etc. And the food was good. 8 courses in 2 hours flat on Lunar New Year's Eve is an achievement.My relatives are regulars and managed to snag a table in the restaurant itself, rather than the function room upstairs. At the appointed time, the table was ready. But upstairs looked chaotic!Everything was good, from the fish tossed salad to steamed fish to fish maw soup. Sea cucumber was tender, scallops were good....lost count of the other dishes!The menu came at "auspicious price of $688, but this is to be expected nowadays

We went to this restuarant on Oct 18. Food there tastes so-so. Please be mindful that manager was only keen to push lobster, crab, fish etc. After we paid the bill, I realized that we were charged for warm water at S$1.60++ (S$1.88) per glass, we had 2 glasses, so they charged S$3.77 for that. I clarified with the restaurant manager Ivy, since we were not informed on such a charge, I was given a very firm confirmation by her that,'oh, yes, we charge water like that..' I was speechless.. So, if you are willing to pay S$1.60++ for a small glass of warm water, please visit there

After checking into the Orchard Parade Hotel, we went to the restaurant passed 10 pm for dinner.As it was late, we didn't want to burden our stomach, so we ordered 1 cold crab and a plate of deep fried quails and a pot of chrysanthemum tea.The cold crab came, I tried the pincer first, the meat came rolling down in bits, dried and had an urine smell. I stopped and told the waitress about it. Without further questions, she gave her explanations and had it replaced. The next one looked fresh and I told my husband, it looked good.Again, I started on the the pincer, yes it was fresh, sweet and tasty. The body was cut into 4 pieces and the yellow roe was chunky, very sweet, fragrant and melts in my mouth! The crab weighed about 500g and for $34 ++ , we thought it was really worth it. At least 3 staff came to apologize to us and enquire after the replacement.On the other hand, the quails were not as good, they were salty. We will not order them again the next time.We will definitely visit the restaurant again for the cold crabs, besides the service is good and the staff were friendly

I had peking duck, duck noodles, tofu and spinach, almond tea and taro paste. Nothing really fantastic - just normal. We spent about $30+ per person. The service was attentive. The waiteress subsequently realised she had forgotten our order of sprite, she was very apologetic. The only real let down was the server 'dropped' a piece of our peking duck skin. She acted like she was going to wrap it anyway but realised i was watching.

We arrived in Singapore almost lunch time and it took time for us to check-in. The hotel staff recommended Kam Boat being located within the hotel where we were staying for excellent Cantonese fare. Late already for lunch we hastened and no longer looked for other choices to partake our lunch. We decided to go to Kam Boat.The place looks the same with the fine Chinese restaurants in Manila, Philippines for special occasions. The food was excellent from the mini appetizer to the (2) sets of teas, the tender beef and other dish. They were quick to act on our request for cutlery. However the servings are small and I learned that they charge everything from the (2) sets of tea which (1) could have been normally be a house tea served for free here in Manila and the moist towelettes too.After our meal we unanimously decided not to take any of our other meals at Kam Boat

It was 1 pm when we checked-in at Orchard Parade Hotel and wanted to have some Chinese food for lunch. Since Kam Boat was just located at the ground floor of the hotel, we decided to try this resto. Our family of four did not order anything fancy, just four cups of rice, half order of roasted chicken and medium order of sliced beef with vegetables. When asked what sort of drinks we wanted, we simply asked for tea and warm water. The drinks came promptly together with a small saucer of peanuts. Food was delicious but to our surprise...the entire meal was expensive. It turned out that they billed us for everything that they placed on the table, including the Chinese tea and the warm water. In our country, all of these are complimentary when you dine in our fine Chinese restaurants. It must have been our fault because we did not bother to ask if they observed the same practice at Kam Boat. I grudgingly paid the total bill of $69.75 and simply stayed away from the resto for the duration of our stay

I went to this restaurant with my mom and my husband for dinner on Sunday (17 Mar). The usual manageress was not there, so my mom ordered the food with another waitress. To be frank, the quality of food maintained, though the quality of the service has became poor. My mom asked for knife and fork when our dish of Peking style spare ribs came. However, the waitress only managed to bring 1 set of knife and fork. When the waitress came, I gave her a hand signal to say to put the cutlery on the table, but she misread it as took the cutlery away. My mom then told her that my husband and I would still like our set of cutlery. The waitress went away and came back more than 20 minutes later, and my mom and I were just about to get impatient of the wait for the cutlery

We asked a taxi driver to recommend a Chinese restaurant for us. Our usual choice, the Ah Hoi in Traders Hotel was very busy so our driver took us (the long way round) to one nearby. The Cantonese Kam Boat Teochew Restaurant is in a small mall (Singapore style) below the Orchard Hotel in Tanglin Road. It's nothing special to look at, just a Chinese restaurant but the staff were friendly and very helpful. The menu was a bit difficult to follow being a mix of Chinese and glossy pics but with some help we arrived at a dinner for two! A mixed plate of starters went down well, mixed BBQ meats but the main courses were even better! An exquisitely presented Razor Clam dish for my wife (Goodness knows why anyone would want to eat one), Singapore Noodles, King prawns and ginger sauce and the best beef dish I've had in a long time - a smoky peppery flavour. Not sure what it was called, the manageress listened to what we liked and sent dishes she thought would suit! We had some light hearted exchanges with the staff and enjoyed a very good evening.No hurry, no pressure, no problems. Price was UK levels
