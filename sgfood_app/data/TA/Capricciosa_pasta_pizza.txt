This is a very good restaurant that serves good food, nice atmosphere and the prices are reasonable. Awesome music and very friendly chefs and waiters too! Best place to go if you want to have a VERY good meal of italian cuisine!

Not only did I have amazing Italian food, but also a lot of fun talking with the friendly waiters. There is a nice selection of wines and the music was very enjoyable, adding up to a great atmosphere altogether. A definite go-to place if you are craving Italian food in Singapore

My husband has a bunch of vouchers for this restaurant that instantly gave a 50% discount and 1 free salad or soup for every purchase. So we went to J Cube in Jurong East to use the said vouchers.Our orders came very promptly after 5 minutes of our order. My comments on the food.The Mushroom soup was served lukewarm. We would have appreciated it if it was served hot. The Salad with tuna and squid was OK but lettuce was not so crisp. The order of shrimp barbecue on a stick with garlic butter rice was OK. The rice in particular was very tasty. My husbands order of beef and shrimp combo with vegetables was huge and was also tasty.Since we had a 50% discount on the food we saved a lot since we also got our soup and salad dish for free.When we paid our bill we even got another $10 voucher which we would probably use when we come back to dine here

Been there at least 10 times cause we stay near the area. I figure the quality of food has gone down ever since it opened. The pizzas are not authentic Italian. We travelled and stayed several months in Italy and know what their pizzas and pastas are like. The soups were too salty for our liking but some of the pastas are ok. The entrees are quite good such as the mussels and calamari but the deserts like the tiramisu was poor. Service wise was generally good. What I found disappointing was when they started charging for water at 50cents! Maybe that is why they make their soups so salty...
