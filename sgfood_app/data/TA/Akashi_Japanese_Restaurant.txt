Dine here once a week and have never been disappointed by the quality of their sashimi and noodles. I know one can get top notch sashimi else where, but hey, for the price here, its well worth it.
Impeccable service.

Worth a visit on the way to Sentosa, located in the Vivocity wall. You can order perfect Sushi via an iPad strapped to your table.

My family is a big fan of Japanese Food.
Also go to dine at Akashi, this location is extremely hot.
Food is okay but need to improve the ACMV.

this had to be my kids favourite mean in Singapore. Reasonably prices, the set meal sushi comes in a bento box which is always a crowd pleaser.

We wanted sushi and decided to give it a try. To start they bring us some appetisers that we haven't ordered. We decided to try it anyway. One was a tofu with century egg. We hated it and worst came when we found out it costs 4$ each!!!! a cheat, for such a small badly tasting starter... Our bad, should have refused it at first.We got our sushi order and we had to ask for more wasabi and for ginger every time.... they do not give free flow on the table, every time we had to ask and they bring a small bit. We love ginger and wasabi and we wanted more. The soy sauce for some reason was very salty too, so I asked for a light soy sauce. They brought only a small plate with it.The worst was when we were eating our sashimi, the staff came to say they gave us the wrong sashimi, instead of the normal one it was the belly salmon, and she asked if she could charge us for the more expensive one, and we said no, since it was not our mistake, we don't want to pay more for it. So she came back and took it from our table, the last piece of sashimi that was left. She did not replace it with another piece of what we've ordered instead. I wonder if she served that piece of sashimi for another client. She was rude and this was unnecessary. In short, the food is good and affordable. The service is normal, but their overpriced unwanted starter is unfair, and the attitude of the staff on the dispute about the wrong sashimi was rude and not a good practice in a decent restaurant. We will never go back there again. Not worth the hassle of feeling disrespected. So many good sushi places in Singapore, just avoid this on

Treated my old Friend to this restaurant for lunch today. The braised pork belly rice bowl set is yummy. My Friend ordered the pork belly with noodle and Ma Cha ice cream. Overall the service is good and it is more worth it if you order the set meals.

This place is not as crowded as Ichiban boshin ,another Japanese restaurant across its unit. The sushi here is of good quality and the price is reasonable . however for the other items such as the fried chicken , chawamushi, they are on the expensive side

Touch pad ordering system, swift service and reasonable food. What more do you want. I was desperate for a Japanese fix and this hit the spot.I had sashimi and two handrolls. The quality of the fish was good, and the handrolls crunchy and fresh. I would eat here again

The place is in the lower floor of the shopping mall Vivocity. It's a great place for a quick sushi-based lunch or dinner. The price for value is very good and you the menu card (you do the order yourself by using the ipads which on your table) offers a lot of sushis and sashimis next to other typical japanese dishes. Very friendly and efficient service

My husband and I ordered salmon sushi, flying fish roe sushi, tamago sushi, ebi tempura maki, soft shell crab maki, yaki ramen, yasai tempura. And a glass of green tea for each of us. It costs us $40. I won't say it's very expensive, but it wasn't cheap too.The food quality was just average, nothing to shout about. But we're disappointed with the salmon sushi. First of all, they were not very fresh. Second of all, the cut of salmon was wrong. Very wrong. This was not how it should be done. Please view the photos. The restaurant is rather small, so families with strollers have to leave the stroller out at the entrance of the shop. Not something I will complain but perhaps the parents should know about it
