Friendly and surpasses the norm! The food was unique, we had the green curry crab and my personal favourite, salted egg yolk crab!

Almost like a private dining experience, this place offers the classic Singapore chilli crab in never tasted before flavours. Try it!

It was a delightful meal at this cosy place around Bugis. Portions were adequate and food was absolutely delicious!

Menu is rather limited with few veggie options. The crab meat is not firm enough. They don't accept Chope voucher. Nice staff.

First time dining at HolyCrab. The restaurant is conveniently located for people who drive and commute via public transport. The crabs were fresh and delicious, their service staff was attentive, and restaurant felt cosy enough to enjoy our meal in comfort.

Never though Crab w Balsamic, simply amazing! Mini Squirters was also fantastic, come early or the crab will be gone!

Worth a visit. If you feel like upscaling your Singapore crab for still a fair price, this is definitely the place. The crab was cooked perfectly - we had the green chilli version (can also be recommended) served with cute steamed buns and Pak choy - great value and really nice service. Can be good for both friends, families and couples.

We rocked up at 930pm but the hours on the door say closed at 930pm but they were very nice and let us sit in for dinner.We had Singapore crab in Australia before but were still excited to try it for the first time in Singapore. We were not disappointed at all. The flavour was so rich and the bread that so soft but crispy. It was nothing like back at home. Love every bit of it. Would definitely go back for dinner again

For crab lovers like myself, this place offers truly unique flavors for juicy crab - the balsamic crab was surprisingly VERY GOOD. Their Holy Cow is also just as fantastic! Even though the 1.2kg (bone-in) AU wagyu came up to $260+, it was very reasonable if you consider the price for 100g serving. The sous-vide'd meat is sooo tender and juicy and it was nicely caramelized on the outside. Their seasonal veg has a very good wok hei tooDefinitely worth a re-visit...sometime soon!!

We wee there for business dinner. 2 Crabs + 4 buns + 2 beers costs us SGD214 which is relatively VERY EXPENSIVE even for Singapore and specially for a crab dinner. At least the food was very tasty and different from other crab stiles you can get in usual places. Since the place is small, a reservation is recommended
