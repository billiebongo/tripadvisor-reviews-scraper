Went for lunch to try their "special dashi sauce pork bowl" from their spring menu. Food was delicious, definitely exceeded expectations, restaurant was nice too.

One of the best Japanese hot pot (shabu shabu) . We love the clear, tasty dashi and the tender Japanese wagyu beef. All the appetizers (seasonal)are fresh and beautifully plated. Very limited seats in the restaurant. Booking is recommended.

My friend and I ordered 2 sets: Wagyu Beef Mabushi Don and Hokkaido Kaisen Don (Sashimi Rice-bowl), both similarly priced at $35. Each set included pickles, garnishes, dashi and rice. The assortment of condiments were placed on each table.The "staff" took pains to elaborate on the 3-step idea of partaking of the former as well as the philosophy of his restaurant in de-limiting the type of set-meals.We kind of enjoyed the small food portions as we made effort to chew slowly and consciously, to appreciate the ingredients. We were struck by the dark-hued and sombre interior and basic decor of the premises, definitely most unlike the posh, cozy ambience of its prestigious Michelin parent aka "serene hills" in Tokyo. Some diners might also mistake the restaurant's proud concept as condescension

A very light yet flavorful dashi brought out the best of all their top grade ingredients used in the restaurant. Balanced flavors throughout all their dishes regardless of whether you are eating their nabe (hotpot) or their entrees. Great personable and patient service as well. While I do wish for a little more generosity in the quantity of food given the price of the dinner, you do get what you paid for with the top grade meats that you get.

When we walked in there was no staff around. We waited for awhile and one of the staff walked up to us and soon disappeared saying he has to clean a table. We waited till he was done and seeing he is alone asked " Could you please let us know how long it would take for the first course to be served?" His response was "We are not McDonalds! We are a two star restaurant! If you want MCDonald speed, go to McDonald's!" Now, our question was fair and we expected an estimation of waiting time. Unfortunately, we were given a rude and ridiculous answer by untrained staff. The sign says the branch in Tokyo has 2 Michelin stars. Clearly the Singapore branch is a farce

We arrived 5 mins early, and they didn't have a reservation we placed through chope. They looked disorganised as there was a card showing they have one table left but they were full.

Soup was flavourful and ingredients fresh. We ordered the basic set (doesn't come with meat) with additional order of beef and pork. Both meats were good but we prefered the beef to pork. Sake selection was limited but quality was good. Overall, satisfying meal but price reflects that. Note: we didn't realise there's another menu in additional to the 'sets' if you want something to lighter.

This was my second time here!! I ordered the kaisendon again and it did not disappoint me. The ingredients were very fresh and you can taste the sweetness and freshness of the uni (sea urchin). Given the small portion of the kaisen don, some people may feel it is pricey if you compare to other places. However, I think It is worth the price due to the freshness of the ingredients. Can visit the place once in a while when you want to treat yourself something good

I love japanese food so once I heard there was a japan town at wisma I immediately decided to give it a try. We took the wagyu set and the pork set. From the start to the end, the service was just amazing be it by whom. We started the meal with a platter brought to us and a demonstration on how to cook the items and what the soups and condiments were. The dashi and shoyu in our bowl and the dashi leek stock in the pot were both clear, healthy, light but packed with flavour. The meat was tender and the sweetness of the vegetables made the soup even better. It was later used to make a zousui with egg and rice. I could eat it everyday.The appetizer was spinach with hints of shiso and mixed with japanese yam which gave the light refreshing crunch and the shoyu jelly was not the typical salty shoyu you get out of bottles but a very light not fishy one. It ended with a Japanese cream dessert with fresh pear and wine jelly. I'm usually not a fan of cream based stuff but this was just wow. It was creamy but the slight acidity and sweetness from the wine and pear cuts down the heaviness. Opened by a 2 michelin star restaurant indeed.
