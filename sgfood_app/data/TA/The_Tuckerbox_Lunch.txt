I had the Chicken Terriyaki Bento today but was very disappointed as my chicken was cold and hard. Rice was only warm. Everything on the plate was cold except for the warm rice.

Nice little place in the CBD for great, non-pricey lunch and dinner. Great for take-aways.
Friendly staff too.
Try the healthy, cold-pressed juices next door at Live Juice Bar (under the same management) at the same time!

Stayed at the hotel upstairs of this little shop. Noticed the lunch crowd queuing for their food and decided to give it a try.Turned out to be one of the best lunches we've had so far in Singapore. My chirashi was cheap $9.8 with good amount of fresh salmon and condiments on top of perfectly sushi rice.My wife's chicken bento box was filled to the rim with many delicious side dishes.Free soup and iced Japanese tea were included in the lunch prices!!! My wife and I came back the next day and was again impressed by their authentic and delicious food

I had the most delicious teriyaki chicken don on my lunch break today i felt compelled to write about it. The chef informed me that the chicken is first poached and then grilled in its sauce! They even grate shishio pepper which gave it an amazing taste! Topped on good quality japanese rice this place is the amazing for cheap but good quality jap food and the chef knows exactly what hes doing

This is the best find i have come across in Singapore, it has the best freshed chirashi ive ever had. It had generous amounts of fresh salmon with avocado and cucumbers and fish roe. And my wife had the Chicken Teriyaki Bento, and the teriyaki sauce was awsome. I later found out that this little restraunt home makes all their sauces, i will definetly come back again
