My family was definitely impressed by the nice ambience environment..quiet and peaceful. An air conditioning restaurant which is next to club swimming pool.Food was delicious especially the chicken nuggets and fish and chips. For the price of $14, you have a plate full of fresh n juicy fish, salads plus the potatoes wedges dipped in thousand island. The sausages and wine was awesome.

Went for dinner with my boyfriend and turned out really good! Their fish and chips are so big you can actually share with your friends. Its good for 2! Ordered the fried chix, tasted so finger licking good! So tender and juicy! Yums. Plus, they are a franchise from fuhua(副华). The in charge explained about the herbs they put into the unhealthy food to make is more healthy. Such a great idea and creativity! Worth a visit if you're around the vacinity!
