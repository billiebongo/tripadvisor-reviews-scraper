Service was without fail, as usual, excellent. And food is always yummy! This is my 3rd visit and quality is still very good.

The lobster bisque is highly recommended. The foei gras was abit blanded. Couldnt bring the flavor out. Pasta is good and dessert well done.

San Bistro offers a 2 course or 3 course fixed price menu below$40 per head or a la carte, all at very good prices.Service was attentive, and food was well presented and tasted good.I had pasta, which turned out to be quite substantial, and would have sufficed for someone who only ate a main course.The softshell crab appetizer tasted a little fishy, but came accompanied by a very tasty and creative salad. Dessert of lychee foam and honeycomb was slightly too sweet for my palate, but combined interesting tastes and textures.Itâ€™s a place you can impress, but not spend too much
5
We had the 3 course meal @29 dollars per pax with additional top up of $5 for the White Orb dessert. The food from their winter menu is excellent, especially the mentaiko spaghettini which was the highlight of our meal. The server were very attentive with the refills, recommendations and explanations of the dishes. It is overall a very good dinner combined with the quaint, quiet environment which makes it a perfect dating location.

Although we stay quite close to this place, we haven't been there before as it didn't look so tempting... finally we tried and what a surprise. The food is absolutely delicious. Service is great. We had lunch there and I think that they should do some improvement in terms of deco. The place should be more cosy especially compared to the food which is high class. Will come again for sure

Had a very gd lunch here. Good food n gd svc. Plc is abit sml but it wasnt crowded. So it was alright. Plating is beautiful..like wat u w get fr fine fining but a neighbourhood cafe price! Good selection of wine altho we din order any.Only negative comment was the seats..too bulky to be comfy.
5
This was my second visit here, and the only reason we came back was because we all loved the food. Service was also excellent. They were very attentive. Pricing may be a little on the high side for a neighbourhood resto so the rating really is for just the food. Great resto in a neighbourhood.

We came to know of San Bistro from a Chope promotional email and decided to give it a try, even though it was far for us Yishun dwellers, as the menu looked appetising and the set price rather reasonable. So we made a reservation for lunch to celebrate my mother's 84th birthday and we are glad for it. The decor of the restaurant was modern with Renaissance black and white tiled flooring and pretty dining chairs with prints of the Eiffel Tower, butterflies, stag, budgerigar and also of Audrey Hepburn. For starters, my mum had the Duck and Soil Salad, I had the Summer Asparagus and my husband had the Pumpkin Salad, all of which were very good and interesting. Ben the assistant manager explained the ingredients in each dish as they were brought out. Karen was also very attentive and served us well. For mains, mum and hubby had Barramundi which came with broccoli puree. My husband ate the skin which was a bit unusual as it was only recently that he started enjoying salmon skin when I cooked it till real crispy. Ben then told us that the skin was seasoned and so had a good flavour to it. I had the Confit Duck Leg that came with Risoni Pasta, Braised Red Wine Shallot & Carrot Butter Emulsion. The melange of flavours was excellent and I was very impressed. For dessert we had Yoghurt Panna Cotta, Dark Chocolate Mousse and Coconut Pavlova. All were delicious and unique. The 3 course set cost $28 which, for the quality of the food was very worthwhile. I will definitely return again, hopefully with a few French colleagues who will have to travel all the way from Jurong

When San Bistro first started, it was a $$$ restaurant in Bedok neighborhood. However when it started to offer value 2 or 3 course meal at affordable prices, it became popular. The food was good (the duck with the small pasta - unique and the peach cheese dessert was of fine dinning standard), service was excellent, plating and cutlery was like a $$$ restaurant. Definitely a must try east side resident for the good things above and also ample cheap parking space opposite. I wld like to suggest to round off the good value value meal for the restaurant to offer wine at around $50 plus. Excellent will be visiting more often for a neighborhood good value meal

Had lunch here today, food excellent and moderately priced. This Restaurant hasn’t been discovered yet, but I am sure word of mouth of this Restaurant will make it a must eat establishment. Well done!

Great food. The steak and frites dish was awesome!
New service crew... value for money. Nice decoration. Shall re-visit.
5
Easy parking, delicious food, relaxing environment, humble chef, 6 star food with menu that changes regularly and stellar service. A rare gem of a place!
5
It's probably my third visit here and as always, it never disappoints. The service staff are attentive and their lunch sets are reasonably priced. Love it!

I used to rate this restaurant five stars for food quality, price and service. Food and service quality remain five-star, but the higher prices of set meals? No!
5
Please help to keep San Bistro at Eastwood Centre alive by patronising! Good food and very reasonably priced. 3 courses for $28++ but I paid supplement for better dishes below.Chef Josh Chua used to work at Michelin starred Guy Savoy
5
Food is definitely value for money, with their 2-course and 3-course menu in which there is a good selection for each course. Staff were very attentive and took the trouble to explain what was in each dish. Nice quiet setting for chitchat, good for solo, couple & family
5
It was by chance as I was googling for a place for lunch that I came to know of this restaurant. Not expecting much from this quiet part of Singapore, we were pleasantly surprised and pleased that we finally found a venue near our home that we could indulge in quality french fare.So far ,we tried different combinations of their set lunch menus which were all delicious. Eating there reminded us fondly of our trip to France. So, yes, we will definitely be back 
5
The food is very much cater to our asian taste bud. I ordered the Chicken Coq Au Vin for appetiser and Braised Angus Beef for lunch. I enjoyed the appetiser very much as it tasted similar our Har Chong Kei and yet in fusion style. The beef is very yummy too. It is so well braised that it actually melts in your mouth.

A Friend highly recommended this place if you have budget to looking for a "fine dining" restaurant, nice ambience, worthy and delicious meal. Yes, this is the right place you should go. First time been here for lunch and had a very good impressions to patronize this restaurant again, especially for dinner. This restaurant in the evening were well-patronized, therefore must make a reservation before you go. They have 2 courses set S$23 (Appetite and Dessert) or 3 courses S$28 (Appetite, Entree- MainCourse and Dessert). Some items included in the set but need to top up money which stated clearly in their menu. Their friendly staff explained clearly every dishes before you have it. Sure we will go back again

It was a nice and nice ambience. Quiet and food was good. It was good value for the all day set menu.
We ordered additional desert from the A la carter menu and it was good though a big on high price.
5
Did not knew it was there although i frequent that area.
the price was really reasonable and the food was really good.
Not forgetting the services and ambiance was good too.
5
Great ambience and service staff was good and very detailed, polite and well trained. Food was excellent. Making San bistro a regular family hang out place!
5
Good food, affordable price.set menu is value for money. Duck confit was creatively done. Staff was attentive
4
Great food at reasonable prices, good service by Ben and his team. Looking forward to next change of set menus
5
My family and I keep coming back to San Bistro for the amazing food and service, so I'm pretty sure we can count ourselves amongst the regulars now. We love how San Bistro regularly updates its menu offerings, and we can't recommend enough everything on the menu (yes, we've pretty much tried them all at this point)!The place can be a bit quiet at times, which is not a fair reflection of how great it is.
5
Lovely dÃ©cor in a spacious and comfortable setting. Set Lunch menu has a good range of beautiful creative offerings. All items are delicious but the risoni pasta should be a little less salty. Attentive service. The chef has provided the service staff with excellent descriptive verbiage on the dishes but the service staff should articulate them with more confidence and clarity. When moving the vase to another table, it would be nice if staff utters "May I remove the vase?" Overall, San Bistro adds a very welcoming elegant touch to the neighbourhood

Went to San Bistro on a Saturday for lunch and was surprised to find that they do set lunch at a reasonable price even for weekends - $18 for 2 course & $23 for 3 course meal. The food was awesome and nicely presented. Good service and knowledgeable staff and I will definitely go there again
5
San Bistro is a nicely decorated restaurant situated in the east. The service was prompt and the crew were friendly and knowledgeable of their menu. The food was nice and reasonably priced. Comes with and all day 2 or 3 course set. It is quiet and cosy but expect it to get busy when more people are aware of the place. Overall, a highly recommended restaurant
5
I was surprised to find such a nice restaurant in this location.They have set menu for 2 or 3 course at very reasonable price $23 (3 courses).The food is fantastic as well. We had Cauliflower soup and Escargot for Appetizer - presentation was beautifully done and taste really good!Main course was Sandwich and Prawn linguini - Nothing left on the plate! What does it mean to you? We ate it all !!!Dessert is Mango Sorbet even my 7yr old son loves it and finished it all. The services staffs were very attentive and explained every dish to us and I thought that was really impressive service! Well done and great job for service excellent !!!I am sure I will be back
5
A great find, fab food at incredible value! Had our first New Year lunch here today, totally enjoyed it. Will be back❤️

Perhaps with the new staff in the rest it might increase to the level it could be. Its more proffesionel and gives the feeling of fine dining. The kitchen follows i hope. Dont miss it when in singapore. A little bit "pricy" .

Dinner for four at San Bistro. In an unlikely setting (small shop/apartment complex), but good for those of us who live in the far east. Once through the glass-fronted doors, you are greeted by a calm modern setting. Service was unfussy and unpretentious by the young serving crew, and uniformly attentive. You could choose either a set dinner or a la carte, and we took a mixture. Without prompting, the service crew assumed that the single starter was to share, and set the table accordingly. Food was uniformly good to excellent, with a smattering of unusual but excellent combinations. The cost was about expected in Singapore. We enjoyed our visit here, hope to drop around again
5
First visit - food was excellent and service unsurpassed. Very friendly and attentive staff. They explained each dish that was served and eager to answer any questions. Service with a smile always even when our baby keeps throwing his toys on the floor, they were there to pick it up before we could...now that's superb attentive service. There's a set lunch menu, every course was excellent and the cost is reasonable. Will definitely recommend to anyone who wants a good meal with excellent service
5
it was an afternoon to remember with the quality of food & service. Ben our wait-staff was such a star. We took the 3 course Set-lunch with choices made on Caesar Salad / Smoke Salmon Salad / Butterhead salad , with mains of Brunch Brekkie, Duck ragout & Prawn Linguine & ended with desserts- gonna leave this unmentioned as I believe you have to go down to try it for yourself. Great work guys!- dont get complacent :

San Bistro is a favourite dining place for my husband and myself. We enjoy an afternoon serendipity over lunch and tea ever so often. What makes this place so delightful? It is in the high quality food, presented ever so beautifully in their carefully selected tableware. And the service is par excellent. They are attentive and yet not pushy. They offer you water the moment you are seated without the question of "sparkling" or "still" that is prevalent in other European restaurants.Their menu is carefully crafted, and I have yet to be disappointed even though I have ordered basically the same dishes. You taste the careful cooking and efforts that go into each bite, so lovingly and consistently presented.It is definitely a great place to entertain your guests. You can't go wrong with San Bistro. I have brought many friends there and they have been wowed. Always

A hidden gem in The East Coast. Opened less than a year ago. The flavour of the food is unique and tasty. The presentation of every plate is well put together, and there are many different condiments. Price is reasonable for French fine dining. Highly recommend the good value set menus for both lunch and dinner. Service is very good with personalised service. Excellent and highly recommended.
5
Went for the set dinner. Very pleased with how everything was well thought out with great flavor pairings. Modern take on classic French cuisine.Sweet sour granny smith apples with shaved iced ham...Fennels done 3 ways with well seasoned crispy sea bream... Lightly curried cauliflower soup with fresh shaved truffle...there's a lot to like. The panacotta dessert was superb. Highly recommended

Food was real good. The service was v good where they bother to explain the ingredients n how the dishes were cooked. The location is abit out of the place though but will surely go back again. Worth recommending friends and relatives to dine at the restaurant. Thumb up
