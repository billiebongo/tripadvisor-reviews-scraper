Food is really fresh, pricing a little higher than most small restaurant of this size.Service slow, just two service staff, but that's ok, as we waited for food to steamGood for small groups of two, four or six - but don't book for table of 10 (which wedid) ....... only have ONE BIG ROUND TABLE FOR TEN PERSONS.But this isn't the issue with me, as can plan and book early.The issue I have with this Big Round Table is that .. it is just NEXT TO THE TOILET!!

Visited this restaurant with my family as everyone in the family is always keen on seafood. Was skeptical at first but was awed by the way the wide variety of seafood was ‘steamed to perfection’ in a special precise timer steamer pot machine and one can literally taste the freshness of the sea! The family literally polished the pot of congee that round’s up the meal because it was simply so delicious as the essence of all seafood u had steamed earlier are all inside that good stuff! Expensive it is but an awesome dining experience indeed, definitely worth checking it out

First time I've been to a steaming seafood restaurant. Just Steam prepared variety of fresh seafood sets and a-la-carté! The favourite has got to be big fresh oysters from Australia with its shell fish meat the size of my palm! The fresh scallop served free due to its social media campaign promotion was equally sweet! There are some shellfish (not oysters/scallops) which were not opened after steaming (meaning they are not fresh), they changed it for free! Even their steamed fish was freshly prepared! I would not hesitate to visit again if I want fresh natural seafood

Was turned away, together with my elderly parents, despite having a confirmed reservation. The reason given is that I cannot be contacted through a phone.Whether that is a valid reason to not honor a reservation I doubted, as it is Mother's Day, the one day establishment would want to squeeze every penny out of The mass, but the appalling attitude of 'I just cancelled your table and you can't do anything about it and I have no table for you please go away' is of one I have never encountered in any Singaporean restaurant.This is not the only restaurant of similar theme and idea, I'm sure it's the only one that treat customer like peasants

Three of us ordered a set A (seafood) for two at S$99 . The interesting part is the way all the items are cooked. Started with uncooked rice at the bottom of the pot , added water and some dried prawns. On top cover with a grill plate to steam the food. A transparent big round cover to keep steam with a timer set by the staff to monitor the right timing for the steaming. We started with 2 oysters and 2 scallops. After steaming , she lift up the cover and served us. Followed by 4 prawns and some mussels. Then the crabs with glutinous rice.This followed by the half side of a fish, and finally the vegetables and mushrooms. Last part is where the grill is taken off and an egg is added to the well cooked porridge. We do have a heavy meal especially when it is finished off with porridge. While eating , we notice that there are sauces available at the table next to the cashier. Overall the price is above average but understand from the cashier that there is a promotion with a groupon vouchers which we are unaware of . Would recommend if you have the time to enjoy the process of steaming sea food.

A first experience, watching the actual steaming of the dishes we were to eat. For sure, the seafood must be fresh as it was just kind of pressurized steaming. Each dish, depending on the seafood takes from 4-5 minutes to steam. As soon as we had our take of the contents, the waiter would put the next load for steaming. Kind of great to rest between eating and chatting with friends. We took a course and so had crabs, prawns, clams, oysters, fish, cuttlefish and a plate of stirfried Bee Hoon (Vermicelli) freshly cooked from the kitchen. They have a facebook page from which you could message to make reservations. They open in the evenings with some nights stretching right into the wee hours
