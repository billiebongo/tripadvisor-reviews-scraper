This Japanese owned Izakaya is a hidden gem tucked away in the basement of an old shopping mall. Not where you'd expect to find top quality food and sake/shochu to pair.Food and drinks are very reasonably priced but it's so good paired with sake that you can't help drinking more, then drinking more, then eating more... it adds up pretty fast and sake packs a punch so be careful not to get tipsy.This is a very small place so expect to get in close contact and the boss/customers are all very friendly after a few drinks even if you can't speak Japanese so don't be afraid to go in alone and sit at the counter.P.S. Ordering alcohol is compulsory... probably doesn't make much from selling food this good at such low prices
