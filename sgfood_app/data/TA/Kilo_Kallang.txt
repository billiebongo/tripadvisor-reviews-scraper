Extremely friendly service in a special atmosphere. The fusion kitchen offers a wide range of dishes. The soft shell crabs are amazing!

Such a great place, staff was great - amazing wines and food! Try the beef shortrib tortilla and the tuna tartare! Wauw!

Close to 5 stars. Kilo as a venue is not what one expects of a restaurant in Singapore. It is not located in a commercial area for a start. That’s because it’s housed in an old HDB (government built high density housing block) on the first floor (F2). It’s somewhat bladerunneresque with exposed concrete and services. Like an abandoned warehouse taken over by Malay cyberpunks. The big news is, however, that these cyberpunks have excellent culinary abilities. Food was great. Especially wasabi tuna sashimi, gnocchi and charred octopus. It’s Asian fusion but strong Japanese slant. Good cocktails- especially ‘A Sure Thing’. Waitresses are great and very helpful. Prices are not cheap but worth it. Strict timing and 2hr dinning slots indicate how popular this place is but we were not rushed out. A casual bar attracting a young ex-pat crowd has developed outside on the ground floor. Drinks not cheap - buzzy dystopian atmosphere but not same standard as the restaurant.

Setting was unusual for Singapore so was excited by meal to come, the word fusion is always a worry we had most of the dishes available and can not really say I would hurry to order any again, trying to be to clever !! Crispy soft shell crab was very tasty but served in chunks of watermelon which made the tempura batter cold and soggy.Maybe I am being a tad harsh, but expensive and would not return
5
I've been a big fan of Kilo since I first dined in at the Orchard Central outlet when they first opened, unfortunately it has closed. But that has not stopped me from trying their other outlets. From the one in Bali to the one in Kallang, I've never been disappointed. Keep up the great work!

Atmosphere pretty hip, industrial, no fuzz but cosy. Good service but nothing note worthy to say. Great food, wonderful flavors and nice presentation. Good combinations of different influences and nicely balanced. We had the daily specials, some beef with "taco's" and pork with chinese pancakes.My cocktail was a daily special as well, with an interesting combination of ingredients but a bit too "complicated" for my taste. I like them a bit more simplistic and pure.Overall I would definitely recommend the place, but more for a dinner with friends than for a romantic get together. The music was too loud for that and the decor just too minimalistic
2
We were 8 people for lunch today.Overall - ok food excepted desserts and patates bravas.The worst point of this place is the service!Our waitress brought spicy food when we highlighted “no spicy sauce”, didn’t know anything about the food menu when we asked questions, was not able to bring spoon together with dessert, and finished by doing mistakes in the bill payment..Anyway, out of the 8 friends we were, we don’t think we will come back

While we are living in Singapore for almost 4 years, quality of the food and atmosphere is still great. The tables and chairs need replacement, table unstable and not right hight and chairs are uncomfortable, all in all sitting position is not good. For the rest great food and staff, just a point of attention after 4 years

Visited on the market day, and enjoyed lots of stalls. BBQ style food was delicious. Sides were amazing. Staff moved our table out from the cover, when it stopped raining, then it poured. Staff should spend less time moving furniture around and more time clearing plates and bottles

Camp Kilo was good for kiddos. The kids' menu wasn't too big but was sufficient. There were also other finger food available. Worth mentioning were the tostones or "patacones" as known in some parts of South America (though I think they could be made a little thinner). Overall food quality was good, relaxing ambience with latino/ carribean music. Price was quite alright. Kids were busy with activities such as bracelet making using flowers, treasure hunt etc. Also frequented by expatriates.

This is review is actually for Kilo Kitchen, which is right above Camp Kilo but it is a pain to get TripAdvisor to list a new venue ... btw, the location is on the Kallang River with beautiful dusk views.We showed up early at 6pm for the early bird special: $75 for 5 dishes to be shared by two. We ordered another dish (above $20) for our daughter. The Italian / Japanese fusion food is quite impressive. It has been around for five years. So a hidden gem indeed

Camp Kilo is steeped in its own little charm and rocks out some amazing BBQ. Staff are cool and the setting is retro; good place to chill with friends. Recently attended their July 4th evening, co-hosted by Decker BBQ; it was a great night and really enjoyed the atmosphere. Decker in my view outplays everyone on the BBQ front, but 'Kilo' has a buzzing vibe that nicely breaks you into your weekend!!

I went there for an event. The first thing I noticed upon approaching that place is the really loud music. When I settled down with my group, the music gets more and more annoying. The volume is too high. The sound system is not great. That place does not have good acoustics. And the music they placed - latino - is only great if you want to dance with a partner. Otherwise the repetition just drives you mad. I was told by my group that they had requested for the volume to be tuned down but the request was flatly rejected. With the super loud music, we had to shout all night to talk. We had to make a brief announcement within our group and had to move to one corner of the premise and stand around that area to do it. The food was average and could be brought out in a timely and smooth manner. Many of us had to wait a while and a big batch came out towards the end.I asked the server for a Coke and was told I need to go to the counter to order it. I went to the counter and placed my order. The staff, who seemed to be a senior staff, held a cup of ice and a can of coke and was about to give to me and collect the money when he interrupted by a junior staff asking for advice. He left me standing there 2-3 minutes until he finished his coaching before fulfilling my order. I told him he should have completed my order before talking to his staff and letting me wait, and he 'rolled' his eyes at me. I could see on his face the message: Don't tell me what to do

Excellent experience. Food is exceptional and combinations of flavors are wonderful. we tried and shared various dishes and all were simply define. Ask the waiter for the best sellers and you get the best. The setting itself is pretty cool too. At first the place itself was a bit difficult to find
1
Arrived about 7.30pm. No crispy pork belly for an hour, ours is the last order of most meat before they run out. Order alternatives (not easy). Wait 40mins. The. Find out all our food has been delivered to another table! No option but to get a refund and leave. They should really implement a better system rather than shouting a table number over loud music. How about take a number? It's no so hard. Found the table that got our food... knee deep in empty containers. So angry. Never again.

Came on a Saturday night and it was really happening - surprising for an industrial building. Get reservations otherwise one may not be able to get a seat. The vibe was just great. We had a lot of small plates and most of the food was good. However my partner got a stomach upset and he suspects it's from the uni starter. My stomach was a little less upset: we didn't eat anything else that evening except at Kilo.
4
We went on a Monday evening for my Wife's birthday, the place seemed about 85/90% full.Staff in general were prompt, but lacked basic service skills e.g. serving ladies first, waiting for a lady to be finished eating before trying to clear plates, serving wine without showing your back or reaching over unnecessarily - (walk around the table instead). Most discouraging of all, one waiter kept looking at his watch even whilst in conversation with customer, if it wasn't an age or lack of training I would have assumed he was hinting HURRY UP (it was before 10pm thru to 10.30pm).Menu font size was about 7pt, way too small, and off black/blue text on brown paper, so in dim lighting was very hard to read. The fit out designer needs to check themselves, the mini-halogens on track lighting were very hot to sit under, and I'm sure would be killing Kilo's electricity bill (but do make great for photos of dishes). But I also see this as we were just unlucky as we were in the only corner not covered by a fan. However most of the place is very well ventilated, and best of all there was good distance between tables, so you are not packed in like sardines and rubbing elbows with neighboring tables as you would in a downtown or city location.The food was very good, we started with: Korean Beef Tartare, Truffled Tai Yuzu Roll, Beetroot Salad and Seared Scallops. All these dishes are definitely worth eating and ticked all the boxes in ways of flavour and texture. Very happy palates :)For Mains I had the White Snapper Milanese and my Wife had the Squid Ink Rice, in my opinion the Snapper won hands down, as the squid ink rice is quite heavy on the palate, so it needed either an additional slice of lime or be sure to have a wine with hints of acidity to complement the dish.For Desert the Restaurant wrote happy birthday on the plate for my wife - and did a great job with correct spelling (most places misspell), she had the chocolate lava cake with hazelnut ice cream - I had Churros. Both desserts were awesome.We went as a couple, but I think next time we would make sure to go in a group so to be able to sample more of the menu.8.5/1

I've eaten here before but this time reminded me of how good it is. Food was excellent. Every dish was good. Service was really good, which is rare. And price was good for what you get. Best meal all year.

My friend and I came here for dinner and the food was delicious!It is definitely hard to find nice vegetarian food in Singapore so I was very happy to have come there for dinner!The vibes are amazing - it was quite warm when we went, we stayed outside and enjoyed being brought together with lots of other people from different nationalities!I highly recommend if you are in the area!!!https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d2095250-r483286232-Kilo-Singapore.html

visited them during lunch time on a Saturday. There's only a few people. We ordered ribs, chicken, crispy pork belly, pickles, brussels and carrot. forgot what they call them, but what's good is we enjoyed them. the ribs were juicy awesome great. definitely will order again. the chicken was tasty and juicy. the pork belly was ok. i think the quantity is quite less for the amount. the brussels were the best i tried. a must buy!the carrots were cooked well. the pickles.... the flavor is too strong for my taste. overall, we'll definitely comeback! excited to try their lechon. i wish they served rice..

Don't be daunted as the taxi takes you down a poorly lit street to a building with no spectacular entrance.Take the rustic elevator to the first floor and it opens into the bare cantina style feel of the restaurant.The food is Asian fusion and was great, the ceviche, scallops and ribs being particularly great. The wine list was short but the wines we tried were good. The ambience was casual but allowed group chats amongst the party of 8 along with bawdy laughter without disturbing anyone.If you drive there is a car park at the end of the street.Would def go bac

Happened to pop by the restaurant on Friday night with work colleagues. Being a vegetarian, I reviewed their menu prior and knew it lacked vegetarian options. When I reached there, I politely suggested that they should look into improving their vegetarian options and the staff retorted "What can we say, we love our meats". Who in the world says that to a vegetarian customer. I was made to feel unwelcomed and unwanted in this restaurant. And was made to dine with such an experience. No one should be made to feel like that in any restaurant. And then be expected to pay. Appalled. The least I expected was to have the chef tailor make a main dish for me (or other vegetarians) and at least make me feel welcome. But then again, we are talking about people who treat with disrespect
5
If you want to have a stylish yummy evening with friends and with kids try out Kilo lounge or the BBQ on their entrance terrace. And if you stay longer you might shake your bootie in the top floor, where the club is located. The Ceviche is a must, so are the tacos. Salads are rich and wine selection fabulous.

the food here is pretty good, service was very friendly and prompt, nice view of the river, overall and nice ambience and experienc

I went to Kilo for my birthday celebrations with some girlfriends. Arriving at this old HDB (Housing Development Board), it was a bit of an adventure just figuring out if there was an elevator up to the restaurant! There was and it's just in the 2nd level. The service was very good for the night. (In my opinion - this is pretty rare in Singapore!). The atmosphere was great- the restaurant was full which was surprising to me for a Tuesday night but the space between the tables was greater than most restaurants which lent to a sense of space and privacy. And clearly they had well trained staff and w ouch wait staff to cater for all the tables. We selected some starters from the raw and small sections to share and we each ordered a main course. The tuna tartar was the winner. Although the restaurant is categorised as a Japanese restaurant - this is more apparent in the raw and small dishes rather than the mains. I was surprised (and disappointed) to see white snapper "Milanese" - why ruin a fish with breadcrumbs?! The steak looked very good ans 3 of my group all reported it was very good. I had the lamb shank - a dish I normally wouldn't choose but it seemed the 'cleanest' of the choices. And it was delicious - it fell off the bone and with the clear broth and fresh coriander it was truly delicious. Cocktails, prosecutors and red wine matched our meal - before, during and after - the drinks menu was pretty good. I would definitely recommend a visit to this pretty unique restaurant if you get a chance. Tip*** try booking a table near a window.

Delicious dishes and an original menu. Totally recommended for those a bit foodies. The restaurant is in the middle of an industrial area , which makes it even a more special experience. They have a drinks bar downstairs , so you can start or end the night in there

Went to this highly rated cafe style restaurant with my family for dinner. Service was very good and so was the quality of dishes served. Pricing of wines was good. However, we felt the over prices quite steep
4
The food was good. Vibe was great. This Sunday they had family activities and the kids had a good time. Check their site in advance. But the wait time for the food and the line was long - at least 45 min to 1hr. Enjoyed it overall but wait was long
4
Had Ceviche with a very tasty sauce, Grilled Octopus also very tasty and the Ravioli! Everything is super good in terms of food, just for this price, I would expect bigger portions. Music a bit too loud, lowering it would be nice I think. To try
5
I have been to this restaurant a couple of times. Since the last time, it has enclosed and air conditioned its main dining area. The plates vary in size but they tend to be small so one would want to order a few for a meal. Everything that I tried has been excellent, though some dishes have been more memorable than others. I loved the ribs and the steak. If you go around 6pm, they have an early bird special which is an excellent deal (they also have 2 for 1 beers before 7pm). Highly recommended

Went for Sunday lunch with Wife and 2 daughters . Great spot in a sort of unusual location. Thank god for GPS. The chipotle corn was great with two thumbs up from my 12 year old. Pomelo salad not authentic Thai but very refreshing with lots of mint. Pork belly and whole snapper with garlic butter were great. Chicken a bit light on flavour. Lechon tasty and pretty oily. Enjoyed the lunch
4
Far from the shopping malls and all the same restaurants, Kilo has a strong identity ! Located in a HDB, the design is really original and not common. The food is a real discovery, a fusion cooking between the eastern and the western one, flavored, tasty and really original. The only bad point is the noise. Depending on where you are seated, it might be noisy and difficult to follow a conversation. Kilo is one of my favorite restaurants in Singapore, sure 
5
In a city full of great food Kilo takes it to the next level. Everything we ordered was delicious but two standouts were the grilled octopus and the blood orange clams. Will definitely be going back.

We were there on a Friday night. Got our reservation mixed up and showed up a day early. Fortunately, they were able to accommodate us with a "vacate-by" time.The venue, on the second floor is pleasant. Sealed concrete floor, bare walls, a couple of pieces of modern art on the wall, somewhat of a view for a few tables. Music a tad loud, because we were sitting right under a speaker, I suppose.Interesting selection of cocktails. I tried the chili margarita. Very good. Caution, the bar tender has a very generous pour!Kilo's menu is really eclectic and I asked for a tasting menu. They only offer this from 6-7pm mon-thu, so Friday is a la carte. Don't get the logic, but ...Since we were two couples, we ordered a bunch of appetizers, hot and cold and a main or two, to share. Caution, the servings are rather large, we were full before we got to the mains.We had three different raw fish dishes: ceviche, poke and tartare. All uniquely presented, from different parts of the world, LatAm, Hawaii and Europe respectively. However, they all tasted essentially the same.The tongue tacos were very tasty,The softshell crab was good.The most interesting dish was a Japanese Caprese, where the bufalo was replaced by tofu. Unfortunately, the tomatoes were not Japanese, but the local tasteless kind.The charred octopus was not so charred, nonetheless very tasty, served over a bed of mashed potatoes.Too full for dessert
5
Four of us shared a variety of dishes here for dinner last night. From smaller plates to mains they are all suitable for sharing. We absolutely enjoyed each dish. The duck salad was a standout. The only one that maybe was not value for money was the scallop dish, a bit too expensive for just 4. Great atmosphere with a table overlooking the river. All in all a wonderful place to visit with really tasty food
5
Every dish we ordered was an explosion of surprising but exquisite flavours. The kitchen team are doing an amazing job creating beautiful and delicious dishes. The service was brilliant - our waitress took extra care to keep us informed of ingredients in all our dishes after she learnt one of us had a fish allergy. And the drinks are not overpriced (for Singapore!) We had a really lovely evening here and thoroughly recommend it.

We went here with our friends for NYE 2016. Read so many good reviews so I was ready for the best food ever. We arrived and were seated promptly. Good start. Nice vibe to the restaurant (upstairs). We had the 9 course set menu. While the food was "okay", the service was missing. Timing off, our waitress kept trying to rush us, food wasn't delivered to everyone (party of 6) at even nearly the same time, no one explained the menu or what was being served. I wasn't wowed by any of the food at all. Maybe things were off due to NYE but not sure I'm going to go back
5
We go as a small group - get one appetizer and one main each- then share. It works the best. Not a big wine list but what is there is all very good. I love to take friends from out of town here. The restaurant is walking distance from the Lavender MRT for those who might be put off by the location. Don't miss the soft shelled crabs in curry

On a recent trip to Singapore, my wife and I visited Kilo Kitchen in Kallang. This restaurant is near the Rochor River and so it feels "off the beaten track" and has an obviously different vibe than you'll find at one of Singapore's many food hawker centres or restaurant locations within the city's many shopping malls. The Kallang location is wonderful and unique and perfect for couples. Kilo's concept is a sharing menu where you and your dining partner try several small bites (raw or cooked, I recommend you try a bit of both). As I mentioned, it is the perfect place for couples and the sharing menu is the perfect setup for this. Our choices were: spiced salmon sashimi, chicken bulgogi, seared scallop, and black and white prawn ravioli. We finished off our meal with some churros a dish which comes complete with a cooked marshmallow, covered with spiced chocolate and the churros are sprinkled with a match sugar. All of these dishes were delicious.It is not the cheapest place to dine in Singapore, but it is amongst one of the best! The small bit dishes are unique and well done; you'll want to try them all
5
One of our friends brought us to this restaurant saying it was one the best he experienced in Singapore.I have to say he was right ! We decided to take different dishes to share and one of the most amazing are the scallops (see picture) and the tuna tartare. The atmosphere is also very casual and nice considering the cuisine. This restaurant is just a bit hard to find. It looks like it is a residential area. Thanks for the nice moment we had there 
5
Excellent, surprising meal for dinner. Great service. Very happy to have had this experience. Easy uber ride from town
5
Great place for grill and BBQ food. The spareribs and Snapper were perfect with the added spices. But also the Side dishes were very tastefull (patatas bravas & grilled carrots). We were told it was always really busy, but I guess we were lucky as there were more than enough tables available; it was a sunday evening after all. I think they have a changing menu, but I have attached a photo of the menu.
5
Wonderful dinner at Kilo. Appertizers were gorgeous and looked really pretty. The beef tongue taco's were my favourite of the evening, but the scallops and octopus were great too. Definitely a place to go agai
5
An unusual setting, but one we liked. The food is quite unusual in style too, but original and largely excellent. Tuna tartar, scallops, fusion type food- some more successful than others perhaps. We had the Early Bird, and it is really very good value indeed, but I guess it could add up outside of Early Bird. It made for a most enjoyable experience
3
Went there Saturday after with my wife and I and two daughters. We had 1 bottle of wine and enough food for 4 and somehow the total came to nearly $300. The ribs were very mediocre being a bit tough and soggy while the it took two portions of the pork belly to add up to a enough for one person and even then it was, well... mostly fat. The little salad thing was ok but i couldn't finish it, the plantains were nice, the eggplant was inedible and the cornbread was pretty poor at $5 per piece. The potatoes were also forgettable (i almost forgot we had them). ALSO, the beer selection is ridiculous! I would much rather have had one good IPA (or similar) vs the bottle of white wine but all they had was Sopporo and I just can't bring myself to drink that %^$%^$#. Furthermore, this venue is BEGGING for a decent beer selection!  So, while the venue is a perfect laid back outside location where you feel a million miles from Singapore, the whole dining experience needs a total revamp or this place will be dead in a year. I certainly won't be going back
3
We had a great night at Kilo on Thursday; we enjoyed the food and wine very much. Staff was attentive. We were seated close to open kitchen, which was actually not best location. Bit noisy. Only downside was that there was just 1 toilet available; restaurant was packed so we had to queue.....not very convenient during business dinner.
3
Was let down by this place of which I had heard so much.You see a picture of a pig being roasted but even after reaching before 6 pm,its already cut in pieces.Service is pretty slow and you have to do with Sapporo,like it or not;carry your bottle opener.You have to stand in front of a board to know the menu and then stand in a q to order.The food is good-had pork ribs,pork belly and roast pork with red snapper
5
it's a small place with amazing food. the food was in big portion, so you could share it with your partner or friends. the music was nice and the ambiance is perfect. it would be great to go here for a nice dinner or maybe an anniversary celebration with your partner
4
Kilo is really two places. Ground level is an open air BBQ casual restaurant which last Saturday night was really hopping. We will definitely come back and try it.We actually ate upstairs in a converted old factory. Low ceiling and industrial fittings didn't make the place great looking, but the food was worth it. Very different and somewhat experimental. Not every dish worked but the ones that did were pretty amazing. The cocktails were also quite different and worth trying. Overall, a very welcome addition to the restaurant scene albeit a bit pricey and out of the wa
5
Staff were very informative and friendly. Food was excellent. Loved the combinations. Our group of three shared everything as we didn't want to miss out. We enjoyed discovering new flavour combinations. The desserts were divine, perfectly balanced in terms of textures
4
Dropped in for a quick lunch during a bike ride around the bays. We sat outside as it was a great day for outdoor dining. The ribs were by far some of the most tender and tastiest I have ever had. The sauce was perfect, not too sweet. One of us also had the Pomelo salad which was quite spicy (too much for them) but delicious. Lunch is a pretty casual affair with food and drinks ordered from the bar. The food overall was very good
5
Excellent food in a very cozy and intimate environment with amazing service and drinks. What more do you need? A must for fusion Asian food
4
Came here wth 15 friends . Turned out to be more of a drinks evening but a great place and very friendly staff. Outdoors are just wonderful in the evenings. Loved it.
5
Really delicious food and friendly service. Came here with a group of hungry teens and adults and everyone enjoyed it and polished off their food.Only criticism was wine was rather ropey so best stick to beer
2
Waited for 45 minutes after ordering in what seemed like a manageable friday evening. Only 1 out of 3 main dish finally came. 0 out of 3 sides were served. When we clarified with the waitress, she said that the kitchen claimed all the food had been served already! We couldnt wait anymore having waited so long, so we left having only had the fish...and lots of water to satisfy our rumbling stomachs. The management did give a full refund, to their credit, and even admitted it wasnt a busy night for them. Thanks, but no thanks. A pity since we live nearby and would have loved to make this a regular haunt.
5
These guys are certainly creative and great at what they do. I have been to Kilo for the bar atmosphere on a Friday, but until recently, had never dined in. It was a very cool experience.'Kilo under pressure' is when a normal person steps up to the challenge of preparing/cooking a meal for the entire restaurant over a few courses. While you can't expect 5-star creations, the Kilo kitchen crew who obviously keeps the bar high, ensures the meals are pretty darn close.Will be back for the next one - and to dine in general. I believe the owner is very conscious of buying ethically reared meats and supports the 'conscious consumers' Eco-system, which I value.
4
This is the weekend, outdoor manifestation of the Kilo experience. The BBQ is phenomenal. Try everything. The (whole) fish, the roast pork, the ribs.... The roasted veggie sides, the corn bread, even the dreaded Brussel sprouts is so shiok you'll die from food orgasm. It's not cheap... The meats (per 100 grams) and fish ($20) are worth it, but the size to price ratio of the veggies make it expensive. Taste wise, I'd say you HAVE to order it though, so you're kind stuck there. If nothing else, just have 2 full slabs of ribs and beers with the mates - that's all you really need. They even sell super cheap bottles of alcohol - 100 bucks - but be warned... They whack u on the mixers. The frozen margaritas are wickedly delicious and strong. Super time for a weekend brunch. Don't go too early on a Saturday though... They advertise 11am opening, but they're usually not ready for service until 12, so do keep that in mind when planning. Maybe management might consider changing the published time to 1130 instead? Also, reservations are online, only for 10 Pax and above, and take a few days to secure....So keep that in mind when booking.I've been here three weekends in a row.... I wonder why! ;

A Friend suggested this restaurant, superb service, food and drinks including a clever and well priced wine list for Singapore with interesting varietals across the white and red spectrum, probably only six or seven of each but chosen extremely well. The food's for sharing and all the better as you want to talk about it! I won't single out any dishes because they were all fabulous however you simply must keep room for the molten choc cake and raspberry sorbet, again a sharing treat. With huge glass windows, leafy views, the venue is riverside at Kallang so it's not really somewhere to walk to unless you live nearby. Oh and ask about their cocktails, yummy.
5
Really impressed by this restaurant , the char grilled broccoli with yogurt and feta was delicious, as was the beetroot with arugula. I also tried the gnocchi which were very good.
5
Yesterday I and my family ate dinner at kilo's restaurant. It was a great experience, the food was excellent with very original and creative combinations of flavors. The service was very kind and friendly. They get to know you and recommend things according to your tastes. It is one of the best places to eat if you want to experience new flavors and make some friends. breath taking
5
I had heard so much about this hidden joint, and an opportunity came up for dinner with a friends so I jumped at it, and I wasn't disappointed. It was a busy night, and its a large space so the noise resonated through the space, however it created a great vibe, and lots of buzz and ambience. Some places can be dwarfed by all the noise but the vibe and energy really made this place a great dining venue. The food was absolutely delicious, with a selection of shared plates including dish of the night a slow cooked Lamb with Parsnip Puree and Masala dressing. So Yum! We will definitely be back

Spent a very fun Saturday eve at Cam Kilo Charcoal Club! Samw place as original kilo restuarant but the "BBQ/picnic" version! Walked in to what seemed like a bbq at an unknown friends place! Veeeery casual dining - really dont even dress up! Seating outside but loads of fans provide a breeze! People all around and you start feeling extremely hungry as soon as you see the first rack of ribs being served! Oh my soul! We had a feast of Ribs, chicken, fish, deliciously creamy potatoes, burnt yummy carrots, crispy brussel sprouts, creamy buttery corn! My favs were deffo the ribs and carrots! Let down was the corn bread! I felt it was very affordable for a great bbq feast out with friends! Come dressed casually and ready to eat! Nothing posh abt it but what a treat! Will be going again this weekend!

We really enjoyed our recent evening at Camp Kilo. A different location from the usual Sinagpore restaurants and a fun relaxing vibe, with a nice breeze from the riverside location. Very popular with families so if you want to avoid the anklebiters go a little bit later. Simple menu, great quality meat. The ribs were our favourite. Go with a group for a casual noisy evening
4
I rated 4 my dinner experience because of the quality of food proposed, however the level of noise is a real nuisance.First, food - delicious ! we went for sharing option and we tried: tuna wasabi, seared scallops, ceviche, beetroot salad (okela), squid ink rice (my favourite) and lamb. Honestly, all dishes were really good.Only mistake was the desert - we chose the churros, and it was a bad choice - actually the grilled marshamalow which is served with the churros is far better.Secondly, noise - a real problem. We were a table of 4, sitting along the window / riverside, and could hardly ear each other. This will clearly prevent me from going back.Lastly, smoke coming from kitchen and smell. I generally really like the principle of open kitchen, but it was unfortunate that some smoke came from kitchen 2 or 3 times during the dinner. As a result we were really smelling like Korean barbecue when we came out - so don't plan to go on partying after dining at Kilo, unless it's in open area !
1
We had the worse diner in Singapore within 4 years. The restaurant invited a guest chef. Big mistake. We have been to Kilo's at least 4 times and always we had a great night. It started with a fried dish. It tasted like it was fried, left aside for half an hour and the served. Salad after was nice, Main dish fish with beetroot pasta was bad too. We had to share a piece of fish 5 x 5 cm with 3 people. The fish was to sour and there was to much pasta. Dessert was the worse panna cotta ever. Tasteless and the red bean and other ingredients did not have any taste. Guys get your own chef in charge again, do something about noise reduction (we couldn't hear each other talking) and train your staff. Your guy put the food on the table.

Kilo keeps getting it right! I've been going there to eat for the last 6 years on special evenings out and they never disappoint! Such a great venue and the food is always good! From tables of 2 to tables of 8, food can be shared or eaten alone! Now I hear they have BBQ on the roof! I'm sure it will be good! Go now! :)

Loved the atmosphere of the new restaurant at the base of where the other Kilo restaurant is. Outdoor, al fresco dining with a DJ playing music. The smell of the barbecues was great as you approached the space. We went on one of the opening nights so they didn't have their liquor licence which meant it was BYO drinks - but looks like there is a cool bar area for when they are licensed. Food was delicious, and just on all round good atmosphere to get together with friends

small area but super chilled! love the food and service were great! def gonna come back again! love the beef tounge tacos

Located a little awkwardly on the 2nd floor of a stand-alone, former industrial building at Kallang Basin, this place is cool with a capital "C". They also manage the informal eatery and bar on the ground floor and the lounge on the 7th (top) floor. The restaurant is not air conditioned but they make up for it with their food, service and oh-so-cool industrial decor. Food here is for sharing (but portions are a little small for that) and the type of cuisine is fusion- both in terms of cooking methods and ingredients. Surprisingly, it's all very subtle and balanced and nothing overshadows a dish. May be a little pricey for the portions so I'm giving 4 stars out of 5.

Had dinner at Kilo recently and was really impressed by their food, and their initial (before the restaurant started to fill up) service.FoodTheir $75 tasting menu for two (order one dish from each menu section, top up S$12 for the beef or lamb) was really good. Ceviche, broccolini salad, beef tongue tacos (a little small), fish (portion was big), and molton chocolate lava cake (oozy goodness). Many drinks are 1-for-1 but instead of giving you 1 cocktail for another, 1 wine for another, they charge you for the two most expensive and give you the cheapest two free. Was stuffed.SerivceTheir tasting menu is from 6 to 7 p.m. and during that time, we had good service. We arrived at 6:30 p.m. When we'd made the reservation, we were told they needed the table back by 8:15 and we were fine with that. But at 8 p.m., one of the staff told us, in a very curt 'get out of here' way that they needed the table back - now. We were ready to go and were just waiting for the bill so they didn't have to be so rude, especially when their kitchen took their time in preparing our dessert.All in all good. I'd go back. I don't expect much in terms of service quality in Singapore anyway

We had dinner here on Tuesday night with our family of four and a friend. We were looking for a special place to dine out as we were on holidays.Read about Kilo and decided to come here and it didn't disappoint. Food was amazing and delicious, we shared a couple of entrees and ordered a few dishes to share for mains. Menu was interesting , we drank a lovely Italian Rose. The service was friendly and efficient . Would highly recommend this restauran

My partner lured me to this place for a dinner date we both much needed. It was raining cats and dogs, but it soon stopped. The place was no air con, so try to get into the nature/ fresh air dining mood :p We ordered a bottle of white wine to share. Wine was not bad, i can't quite remember what was it we ordered though. For starters, we had 2 dishes. 1. WASABI TUNA TARTARE - so so so good. It came with avocado, and the flavors were blended nicely together. The 2 of us were literally fighting for it.2. CHARCUTERIE PLANK - not bad flavors on the plate. There were a few variety to eat from (PROSCIUTTO, CHORIZO IBERICO, SAUCISSON & IBERICO LOIN WITH ACAR PICKLES, WHIPPED RICOTTA & BAGUETTE). Went well with the wine3. HAND CUT FRESH PAPPARDELLE (CREAMY EBIKO, CHARGRILLED PRAWNS) - I love this dish!!!! Prawns were fresh, pasta was well cooked. The creamy sauce did not made me sick, in fact it was so good i could have a second serving. 4. PAN ROASTED BEEF RIBEYE (ONION RINGS, HERBS, SHITAKE SALAD) - we asked for medium raw and it was cooked perfectly. Tender and juicy, nicely sliced onto the plate. 5. CHOCOLATE LAVA CAKE for desserts - this one was average. had better ones. But good to round up the lovely dinner and night! Music was good, puts me into a hip jazz mood. The place was packed with workign adults so do make a reservation before you go
5
I recently ate at Kilo with a small group and that meant we could order a selection of dishes and try them all. We tried the Wasabi tuna tartare, the truffled tai yuzu roll, chicken bulgogi and the prawn ravioli, spicy duck and pomelo salad and the broccolini, the goats cheese gnocchi and the bbq pork ribs. For dessert we had the churros and the chocolate lava cake. We especially loved the duck salad, the gnocchi and the ribs and the desserts were incredible. What was even better was that we had the early bird menu which included drinks at 2 for the price of 1. It represented incredible value given the quality of the ingredients. The room was very cool, we loved the atmosphere of the restaurant and would go back if we find ourselves in Singapore
5
We would like to thank the team for a wonderful job well done. Special thank you to Fiona for being so kind and showing us that she loves what she does. It was a great night. Food was lovely too.Cocktails could be improved. Also more choices on the food menu would have been great. Overall 2 thumbs up
5
I can't sing the praises of Kilo highly enough. The food is utterly delicious - truly breathtaking. The staff are brilliant - they really make an effort to make the evening as amazing as possible for you. A particular mention needs to go to Chris the bar man who took the time to talk us through the menu and set the tone for a truly wonderful evening. Believe the hype - this place is fantastic and is absolutely not to be missed !

Back in Singapore after not being here for years. We heard about this restaurant and we checked it out.... Unusual space, an old industrial building, which they kept in tact. Exciting new style of cuisine. Very friendly staff. We liked it a lot! (Only a minor thing: food was served very quick, we were finished within an hour...)Can really recommend if you wish a different night out dining
4
Located in a dilapidated building, we were really impressed from the Kilo. On the second floor but completely open, we really enjoyed a lazy evening with good food and excellent cocktails
5
We lived a 5 minute walk from kilo so ate dinner here several times - always need to book ahead and if you want a table for a Saturday night, aim to book 2 weeks in advance. When you taste the food, you'll understand why it's so popular - amazing flavours and beautifully presented. We'd particularly recommend the fish ceviche, fig and blue cheese salad, and the fabulous naughty pork and beans which is served with a soft poached egg to stir into the spicy sauce
5
Went here with a group of friends, and the food is absolutely amazing! We ordered a variety of dishes and shared, family style. Not a single dish was less than great, and the service was attentive and super friendly
5
We have been meaning to visit Kilo for some time and when we finally made it we weren't disappointed. The restaurant is in a great space, the food is excellent, the service was very attentive and we thought it was good value for money by Singapore standards. Try the tuna tartar and the pork cheek with spicy beans, delicious. Thoroughly recommend a visit
5
Recipes are original and bursting with flavours - unlike any other place in Singapore! Cool ambience as well and is a great dinner destination along the river and lush trees with friends or with a special date ! We often go back and will continue to do so
5
This place is so different in all respects it just needs to be added to my favourite places in Singapore! Set in Kallang/Bugis on the 6th floor of an old warehouse (no signs, and yes, it looks like the building is about to come down soon..!) , it is so worth a detour. A concept menu made for sharing dishes, knowledgable waiters, a good selection of wines, excellent food quality. We had five different dishes to share between our party of three and it was plenty and delicious. Very young and trendy atmosphere with raw concrete walls and open "windows" . Packed on a Wednesday night in late November so wise to reserve well in advance. Enjoy!
5
Unsuspecting place off the busy roads and what looks like an apartment building. The lounge on the 5th floor had delicious cocktails and our table was right on time. I have to say this place had some of the best food and they had the timing perfect for a table of 5. Great place to share the delicious food. Loved: tuna tartar, warm octopus salad, the BBQ ribs and well everything we are! Topped off with churros and chocolate lava cake! A must go if in Singapore and you love great food!!
4
The Kilo is around for almost 8 years. Here you have a different feeling of Singapore. the food menue is great and has unique choices. However not all of them are to our taste. but overal there aremany good choices. The staffs are attentive and nice. The lamb racks were tender and delicious, the fish Milanese as well.
4
The food is original and quality is very good . This is combined with an interesting affordable wine list ! The service is friendly and efficient . The thing is that the place has a nice buzz
4
The restaurant was pretty great, fusion food, fun to eat, a great place to hang out with friends. Interesting location
5
The food is excellent and the chef behind the cuisine must be commended. Here is a fusion that brings new dimensions to Japanese and Western cuisine. Great presentations and aromas and tastes.The location is a bit off the beaten track but this is the intention,I would assume. It's airy and not glaring. You can relax with friends and family. And you feel good about it all when you after finished meal leave Kilo
4
He heard a lot about this place, so there is always an expectation that it could be a let down. Happy to say that it lives up to the hype and reputation. Great food, excellent service and a cool layout. Nothing singularly stands out, and everything we had was flavoursome and enjoyable. The lounge upstairs is homely and has some nice comfy couches. Certainly going back
5
We had a wonderful dinner at Kilo The setting ,riverside in an old warehouse, concrete floors, windows open to the river breeze. The food modern, fresh and delicious plus a diverse cocktail list . We felt that the $75 per couple deal ( commencing dining between 5 pm and 7 pm ) was excellent value. We started with spicy duck and pomelo salad, and the fig salad, then charcuterie plank and scallops, with mains of pork rib lets and lamb. Dessert of chocolate lava cake and churros . The staff were friendly and professional, highly recommended
1
Had read great reviews on Tripadvisor - my trusty travel companion. A long way to venture for what was ultimately an uninspiring menu and ordinary food that was well matched to ordinary service. We were left wondering how it could have rated so well.
5
This is a fun find tho, the setting is quite unique with being an open space with plenty of air. Due to all the fans around its not even that hot as i thought. The stuff is pretty attentive and the food is well prepared. Combined with a few after-work drinks at the lounge i definitely would recommend the place for a decent evenin
5
The food was delicious. Have yet to try their raw food but I bet it's gonna be good. The place can get a little warm (no aircon) and the table was a little too low but that doesn't stop me for wanting to visit this place again
5
I took a party of just over ten here for a work Xmas dinner and it certainly didn't disappoint.Starting with what's most important, the food is not only of a very high standard but it is also slightly quirky and interesting. Dishes aren't served exactly as you'd expect them and it is all put together in an innovative and playful way. For larger groups, as our was, the dishes are served buffet style which at first I didn't think would be great but they made it work really well - it also complimented the nature of the dishes nicely and gave us a good opportunity to try them all!One of the most striking things about Kilo is its location. Based in an old apartment block a little bit out on its own, you'd be forgiven for not noticing that there is even a restaurant there. They use this edge well, and have styled the interiors in such a way that it has a slight feel of urban decay whilst still being very smart and tidy. Whilst the restaurant is on the second floor, Kilo also have a lounge/bar (which turns into a club later) on the eighth floor which continues this theme and also offers nice views across the river.Finally, the service rounds things off nicely. All of the staff were friendly, helpful and attentive without getting in the way of our party. I would highly recommend a visit and fully intend to go back myself in the not too distant future
5
Even if the words innovative, modern or fusion put you off, you should still try this restaurant if you are foodie because the food is excellent. It can be hard to get a reservation but it's worth the effort. If you walk in but can't get a table at the restaurant on level 2, they now have a lounge bar with finger food and views on level 8 where you can get interesting cocktails or wine by glass
5
I've been a fan of the restaurateurs of Kilo since their first restaurant in Bukit Timah, Raw Kitchen. At first, I was disappointed with its closing and wondered why they chose to redo their menu. Well, they've proven my concerns irrelevant and unfounded. Everything on the menu is unbelievable. The Beef Tongue tacos are a revelation. Your best option is to just order everything from their raw and small menus and just share it with your friends. Pair it with their spicy margarita (which has jalapeños and is actually spicy!), and you can't go wrong. One of my top restaurants in Singapore
5
It's a Very interesting experience. It's located in an old building. It's a mix of Berlin atmosphere and Asia. Some local friend bring me there. I'd will never find this location. It's out from the center. They also have a bar at the top. Food was Asian fusion. Interesting flavour. Quality expat crowd
3
Very friendly staff, I must admit. Really helpful, nothing to be said about that. We had appetizers, main course and dessert. We remembered from the last time that desserts were sublime... this time around the dishes were OK, but not spectacular. Less than we had expected. We found that some of the descriptions on the menu do not really reflect what you get on your plate. They will get this remark more often if they keep it like it is. I for one was really surprised to see what was in my plate. And remember, I wrote a spendid review after our last visit, so I'm a fan. Or at least, I was a fan. Dessert was also a bit less than last time but all in all the place looks good, feels good and we were OK with the experience. Then some time later that same evening I had diarrhea. Definitely from eating there, knowing very well how my stomach works. I'm not sure what it was from, but it was bad. And although I love(d) this place, if you end up with diarrhea afterwards, then this is inexcusable. Still I give three points out of five for all the rest, but this obviously means we'll wait (a long time) before we go back there
5
Great place to spend an evening with friends or for a date. Great food, great cocktails, great vibe, and friendly service staff. What else to wish for.
5
I went here for a business dinner and the food was out of this world. The preparations are very creative and the ingredients very fresh. The service is fabulous and the staff are very attentive. Good selection of wine and some yummy cocktails. Dessert was out of this world and I caved and had the chocolate with a liquid center.. Must visi
2
Certifiably the rudest manager/host we've ever come across. We've been around the world and have never been treated so rudely nor spoken to like a child.Kilo's saving grace is the food and decent service staff. Thing is the food is good but not great enough for us to tolerate an extremely rude hostess who happens to be the manager of the Kilo Kitchen! Unbelievable
5
Delicious, great service, and a warm and friendly welcome.Not the typical place that tourists will look for but residents will like it
5
A failsafe for me in terms of quality and one of the best restaurants in singapore. Incredible dishes, unique combinations of flavours, and a rather special setting in kallang. Highly recommend
5
Been here a few times now and never been disappointed. Lots of creativity in blending flavors and textures. The chef is not scared to push boundaries and depart from the "safe" dishes.The service is excellent and we really like the industrial look for the place.Still make the top of the favorites list even though prices have notched up a bit over the years. Never been to Michelin star restaurant but this is how I imagine one to be
5
Located in what looks like a run down abandon commercial building is Kilo. The chefs plays with a lot of local and Asian Flavours in order to create a wonderful dining experience. Great staff makes it even more enjoyable. Dining hall is not air conditioned so dress down or dine later in the night
5
This place caught me by surprise. You jump out of the cab and are faced with a desolate looking building. I thought I was in the wrong place! Go to the 2nd floor and wow - an open dining hall with a menu that screams eat me. Our waitress was brilliant - ran is through all the options, mentioned her favourites and the let us get on with it - we took a couple of her favourites - tuna, salmon and the ribs, but added some of our own - snapper and soft steel crab. All meals looked fantastic and tasted that little bit better. The service was as good as I have experienced in Singapore. Great restaurant - no white tablecloths, but a whole lot more....
5
In a weird place, we thought the taxi had got it wrong as looks like a small apartment block. Decor is basic, concrete floors and walls but don't be put off. Food was delicious, a cross between Mediterranean and Japanese. Staff were very friendly and helpful. Drinks reasonable re Singapore standards. For 4 we had 4 starters, 4 mains, 3 desserts, bottle of white, 2 beers, 1 cocktail, 1 Coke, came to 420 sing dollars. Would definitely recommend as food was delightful.
4
We had dinner their this week and it was a very pleasant experience. the place is very unlike most places in Singapore and reminded me of Amsterdam where we come from. The restaurant is situated in an old social wellfare building and the interior is a combination of industrial and 70's furniture. food is a fusion of many cuisines brought in a tapas style manner. Good service, decently priced and great venue
5
Had a great time here with good friends. The dishes are great for sharing. Unusual but always good combinations. Nice wines too! Thank you Alan and Alicia (sorry if I spell your name wring) for making our evening out a real treat
5
Been meaning to try Kilo for some time now and finally got the opportunity and well worth it. It is now famous for being out of the way in what can only be described as a cleaned out floor of an HDB in the back streets off Kallang Rd - perfect for the concept.As you get out of one of the slowest lifts I been in for sometime you are graciously greeted and seated. The decor can only be described as minimalist, with an open kitchen.The staff are excellent, friendly and helpful ... a pleasant change from some other notable high end restaurants in the more famous areas of Singapore.The food, an innovative fusion of European and Asian flavours was excellent. Try the softshell crab, scallops and salmon, my favourite was the tuna tartare. All were prepared well and the flavours did not over power each other - ingredients were well selected to compliment in each dish. Wine list is reasonable in selection and pricing.A definite for foodies, we'll be going back to try the rest of the menu
5
Great fusion food and superb Sake Sangria Cocktail - high end done to perfection in a cool 'warehouse style' setting with a relaxed feel.
3
Went there a few weeks ago, environment is really nice, service was ok in spite of the fact that the restaurant was quite full.We loved the food, kinda fusion, but a bit upset when the bill came.. We heard a lot of good things about the place, in the end we didnt have to complain, but can do better
5
This place is not easy to find but once you get there, it has a brilliant chill atmosphere with well trained staff and creative good food
5
This remains one of the BMaD team's favourite restaurants.Buy undeniably we love to party and Kilo Lounge. Drinks are great some of the really out of the box and above all the music in this lounge has to be the best in town. The DJ lineup is always surprising and engaging and the place gets packed The only problem is that if you get there late there is a line at the elevator... Because we don't like waiting we usually order our drinks while we wait and by the time we get to the 8th floor is waiting for us at the Buy Me A Drink App pick up spot. The only lounge in Singapore that never gets old :)
5
Excellent food and ambience. Not very easy to find if you are riding a taxi. Would recommend going on a Friday or Saturday night to enjoy a good crowd + great food. Tuna tartar, pork belly and spicy chicken wrap are delicious. Has a bar on the 8th floor that's worth the visit when the haze is not around (November-July)
5
My friend in Singapore showed me this place and it became the best meal ever in my Singapore trip!!! All dishes were incredible. I went with 6 friends and we ordered 12 dishes to share. They have quite big menu, so all dishes we ordered were recommended by the manager there. Kilo's food is very creative and such a nice fusion food. My belly was very happy that night. Here is my review for each dish.Wasabi Tuna Tartare and Spicy Salmon Sashimi - both of them had very good flavours. I prefer Spicy Salmon one though, tasty and a bit spicyWarm Octopus Salad - the sauce was very yummy and good mixed with peanut brittleGrilled Broccolini - fantastic dish!! I highly recommended. Very delicious and good mix between perfect grilled of broccolini and sesame past and Stracciatella cream. Sushi - surprise fish by chef, it was good.Squid Ink Rice - Very yummy and it's one of my favourite dish at Kilo.Spicy Korean Chicken - not sure the name on the menu but so delicious. It taste like Spicy Kimchi sautÃ©ed with chicken, it served with fresh green lettuce and veggie Pork Belly - After my belly was nearly full, this dish has arrived. It taste good but still can't compare with other dishes I had earlier.Baby Mussel - Highly recommended. very tasty and yummyMixed Salad with Beetroot - very healthy and fresh. Gnocchi - another yummy dish, wish I could eat gnocchi more but my stomach was nearly exploded :PBBQ pork Ribs-let - good BBQ flavour.I strongly recommended to go to this bar and restaurant. They have more than 20 dishes here. Not only Kilo serves fantastic food, but also great place to hang out and drinks. In this building, the restaurant is on the 2nd floor and bar is on the 3rd floor. have some nice vine and cocktails. Good food, good drinks, good company, good decor and atmosphere, what else do you want :) I will definitely go back to Kilo Kallang again for my next visit in Singapore
5
They have so many fully deserved excellent reviews that I was tempted to pass but I learnt by the grapevine that sadly the old stand alone building hosting Kilo will not be there for ever... So that prompted me to write how much I loved the restaurant (do not expect air conditioning indoors, it is open on each side for the breeze to cool the place), the friendly and faultless service, the surprising and delicious dishes (I suppose "fusion" but eclectic) and spicy cocktails!From there, it is easy to move upstairs to the lounge that turns into a nice little dance spot and you avoid the queue of good music connoisseurs that invariably forms to get in.Someone wrote that Singapore needs more places like Kilo and I agree 100%
5
A good place for Lunch/Dinner and even better over the weekend, when they hold somewhat Singapore Style Underground parties. Great Crowd, Reasonably Priced Drinks and even Better Music playing.Would recommend it to everyone
5
Been to Kilo about 3 x's now, and every time I leave tremendously pleased. It doesn't take much to make me happy, but when you dish out 5/5 platters that make my taste bud explode, good music, awesome staff, and a gorgeous and cool restaurant, then I am yours. Singapore needs to have more places like this
4
This review was for Kilo Lounge which was two floors above the restaurant in an industrial building in Kampong Bugis. There was a great view from the windows and the DJs mixed up a heady musical cocktails. Drinks were ok but I was more taken by the atmosphere upstairs. Would definitely come back for drinks with friends
5
This was by far the best food we had in the week we spent at Singapore. We had dinner, then went up to have cocktails.
Javier and his team are world class, in every respect.
Kudos!!
5
I had the luck of being invited to Kilo by some friends. Wao, what an experience. The service, the presentation but most of all, the food was just spectacular!
4
Visited this restaurant a couple of months ago, food is fantastic and yummy. Service staff very attentive, after each course, staff will come by the table and check if we have enjoyed the dish.
Totally will recommend to check this place out
5
I booked Kilo for my girlfriends birthday last Saturday. I have to say, the food was incredible. I don't think there was anything that I didn't like. The staff were excellent and extremely helpful. In particular an Indian (I think) gentleman who went above and beyond good service.One negative is that we had a vegetarian with us who was not served her second dish until the meat eaters were on our 4th or 5th. Still, serves her right for now eating animals :POutstanding dishes for me were the salmon sashimi dish with what tasted like tequila sauce, but not sure. Anyway it was excellent. The chocolate lava cake with strawberry ice cream was literally the nicest dessert I ever had
5
The setting, the atmosphere, the service, the wine... But above all the fabulous food. What a treat!! All flavours an combinations were an absolute hit. Will return without a doubt!
5
Amazing food, the ravioli and scallops were divine. Good Sauvignon Blanc as well. Good atmosphere and all windows open, no airconditioning that's the way we love it. Friendly staff and the dessert we had with the fortune cookie is absolutely a must, no kidding. Only minus points are the location and once you get there, you have to ask around where the place is if you go there for the first time. We didn't see any sign at all. You have to take a small elevator on the right hand side. Once you know it, it's easy. Overall a place you can go to with friends and something you can recommend
5
Food, Drink, Service, Space all were outstanding. well its a place to relax and have a chat. food was delicious and simply amazing. really cool and soft music around the corner with natural breeze blow from Kalang river side. My wife being loved KILO and me as well
5
Really funky, chilled atmosphere. A perfect blend of relaxed and hipster. Food just melts in your mouth. Really flavoursome, thoughtful taste combinations. Staff were really friendly, attentive but not hovering, which was great. We will be back for sure.
4
Wow, down a lane, no bright lights and glam. Up a lift and door opens, 3 weeks to book this concrete floor expanse.Great food, staff and ambience, not dislike Port Douglas old Sass's restaurant.Well done we will be bac
5
Our experience at kilo was spectacular. Food was excellent: from the tartare, salads, to the ribs and steak. Everything we ordered was prepared and cooked to perfection.The ambiance is great as well. Located in a older looking building, on a floor with a great view to the river and plenty of breeze as there are no windows.Once you are done with dinner, head upstairs to the Kilo Lounge for some drinks and dancing.Highly recommende
5
was introuced to kilo by a friend, this place is a true hidden secret food fantastic, atmosphere brilliant, can't wait to go back
4
It's a little hard to find but well worth the adventure. A small lift takes you up to the 2nd floor were you'll be treated by an open kitchen and rows of tables. The service is first class- the food was amazingly good and the atmosphere was terrific. The squid ink rice was the standout dish for us. Well worth the price and we'll be back no doubt
4
It's not difficult to find, and when you do, it's an amazing discovery. It's a bit like falling in love with Singapore again, what with the river and greenery all round you, but then you're still in familiar territory, with Hdb-like features surrounding you such as the concrete floor, funky lift, corridor railings and window fixtures. The lack of a/c is made up with the fans and breeze from the river, coupled with a constant stream of ice water.The food takes a while to arrive, and they're really sharing portions, despite the price (about 20-30bucks each). Order the same number of dishes as people with you, plus 2. So get 5 for 3 people and you've got yourself a good-sized meal. The wasabi tuna tartare is good, but not as spicy as I'd have imagined. The pork and ribs are great. The black squid ink rice is really tasty. Desserts are brilliant. Yuzu and the lava cake were top notch.Visit at least thrice in your lifetime. That should get you through the menu. But be sure to book early
5
When our cab pulled up, we weren't sure we were at the right place; in front of us stood a small warehouse with no signage. But this was it! When the lift opened on the second floor, we were welcomed by the open kitchen, co-owner and friendly staff; we were seated at a tucked away table for two facing the river. The minimal space is open on both sides to let the breezes through. We shared a delicious bottle of Tin Pot Hut Pinot Gris (NZ) and made out way through what I consider to be my favourite food experience in S'pore. We started with the beetroot salad (nicely balanced sweet dressing with peppery rocket) and the tuna tartare (recommended by our server, who did not lead us wrong), followed by the homemade goat cheese and ricotta gnocchi (comfort food at its best) and the BBQ pork rib-lets (melt in your mouth). We finished the meal off with the pistachio cake and fortune cookie (both yummy). We would go here again and again and never tire of the ambiance and food, and kudos to the staff who were always pleasant and attentive. Purely enjoyable
4
Food and wine were excellent, location a little bit "hidden", service good, I really liked the place, with open walls and lot of air (no evening under the AC !! Thanks !!!).Minus point: the location is a bit remote, you should go by taxi... this add to the bill. Not cheap but food was really excellent, it has been a long time I did not eat that well. Thanks Kilo! See you soon
5
The restaurant is relatively hard to find but boy is it worth it! The place looks great, candle lights, half open air space, great music. The staff was helpful and super friendly.But nothing compared to how great the food was! We had a sushi roll with truffle oil, perfectly seared scallops, melt in your mouth pork belly and creamy pasta. The sharing concept allows you to try more which is a big plus.Head upstairs to their cocktail lounge after your meal for a nightcap, same ambiance and great cocktails.The place isn't cheap, but I wouldn't call it very expensive either and for the quality of the food, it's well worth it
4
A unique restaurant with really good (but not cheap) food. The open-air converted industrial space reminds me of restaurants in Berlin. Nice to have such diversity in Singapore. Their "Kilo After Dark" parties have awesome DJs that spin Berlin-style beats
5
Have not been for a while and pleased to see the quality has been maintained. The dishes are best shared so we had a number of entries, including spicy salmon, rolls, beetroot salad. All of it tasted better than the description, and that rarely happens in Singapore these days! Ordered some squid and rice dishes along with a couple of cocktails and wine. Not super cheap but we were well fed in a great environment. And later there is a pretty cool bar upstairs to continue on
4
Another reviewer called it a hidden gem, and the location is certainly unusual. The decor is best described as concrete, but none of this detracts from the food, which is well presented and tasty
5
This is authentic in ambiance and interestingly tasty food with interesting twists and nice cocktails. Very local feeling
3
A great place for a breezy night as the restaurant is located beside the Kallang Riverside. Ambience was lovely. Very basic and down-to-earth interior yet spacious and airy. Crispy chicken skin in the salmon sushi added a nice crunch to the rice roll. Wasabi tuna tartare was a little disappointing, as there was no 'kick' or punch from the wasabi - too mild or plain, lacking character. Cheesy potato wedges had generous portions of bacon strips. We didn't think the crispy baby squid or prawns did justice to the squid ink rice as the tastes of these didn't integrate. (Maybe shredded crab meat might blend better into the rice?) Pork belly was sinfully tender but nothing memorable about the taste. The greyish brown chocolate lava was not the most appealing but chocolate was oozing out. Didn't expect the Bourbon to be so subtle. BUT service was fantastic and staff were really attentiv

My second time at Kilo in as many weeks. Food good to great but service dire. Same waitress same problem. Service recovery on a wine glass with lipstick stains was not good. One unisex toilet for so many diners also needs to be addressed. I get the understated decor and I love the sharing menu. The Singapore split was markedly different from the first time. The proprietors need to try harder to make this a hit.

We had a fantastic and mouthwatering lunch. Was salmon and tuna sushimi was amazing. The service was great and its nice being tucked around the corner in the cool
5
One of my favorite places in Singapore. chilled, hip, excellent food. + a lovely breeze from the river.finally something different
4
Definitely one of Singapore's most hipsterish eateries, but doesn't fall prey to style over substance. The food is inventive and of good quality, although a little on the pricey side. Decor is more Kreuzberg than Kallang: all exposed concrete and dim lighting, and the semi open-air dining room has nice views over the river - views that few tourists ever get to see given how far Kampong Bugis is from the regular tourist trails. Best of all, the bar upstairs opens late and plays host to some of Singapore's best DJs. The owners clearly know their house music, and have built up a loyal following with a series of lively parties. If you're looking for a good night out off the beaten track, I would definitely recommend Kilo

This place is a great find. The food is high quality and flavors.Great selection of wine. The place turns into a bar post 11:00.Worth the effort to get there
2
Went there last Saturday night with two other couples. It was below average. I had been told by friends the food was excellent. I had the scallops they were over cooked and drowned in sauce. Won't be back and will not recommend to friends.Overpriced for the quality of the food
4
I love this restaurant, I think the food is great and I look forward to going back again to eat my favourite dishes! My only complaint is that they sometimes struggle with big tables/a busy restaurant, but they have always made up for issues when they arise, so I can forgive...
4
A bit off the beaten track this restaurant and the other bars in the building are a great place to hand out with friends and have great food. It reminds me of alternative venues in Europe and is very different from the normal Singapore mainstream restaurants that have a fabric softened design. This place is authentic and raw. It has edges but it is very creative.The food we had was great, beetroot salad, tuna tatar and ceviche. The main was the wagyu beef that had an interesting spicy interpretation. The desert was to die for, Singapore Split.Great place, but remember you need to reserve way in advance
5
Inventive and Fresh!Want a sophisticated menu with delicate fusion of European and Asian? Off the road from Lavender SMTR on the Rochor River you will find a meal that delivers fresh and flavoursome cuisine in a laid back minimalist interior supported by friendly and capable wait staff with a first class kitchen. A highlight for of the trip for my wife and I. We enjoyed; the beetroot salad, chilli prawn flatbread, scallops, ink squid chilli squid, and a desert of corn bread and strawberry. We will be back
5
Awesome food! Not the usual kind of food you'll get in Bali. Very creative and delicious! Friendly staff, good ambience and nice music-good to chill at the bar before dining. Will definately come back again! Thanks for all amazing experience! :)
5
Highly recommended! I love this place,the food and vibe are amazing, friendly staff, creative delicious fusion like dishes, you can feel the passion the food is prepared with! Amazing spot! Kilo Restaurant rocks! Yum yum yum!
4
there is no a/c-but that's ok because it is next to the river there is always a breeze-sometimes the elevator does not work-so you sometimes have to walk up couple of flights of stairs, so!the bathroom has a thumb bolt for a lock, so i have seen worse in the U.S.they have a corkage fee, but they have a very good wine list-they have an excellent selection of cocktails, very reasonably priced-we only had the appetizers which were ALL very good-the service very good
5
Don't be put off by the location (slightly off the beaten track, down a badly lit street....take a cab)...this is a 5* dining experience. No frills, cement floors, stylish and simple interior letting the food speak for itself. We had great service and would go back again
1
How do I start? I was invited to somewhere I had not been before and there were a number of good starting points. The bar upstairs was funky and fun, but the service was slow. The lift was broken and I note this is a chronic problem from others.Then dinner downstairs was very good sharing food, except the service was extremely slow..............But then the rude awaking came! After eating what I thought tasted very good I went to the toilet. There was only one, unisex sit down toilet with a bit of a rickety door and primitive lock. It was right next to a table of two diners and very near to others, and I do not know how they enjoyed the queue stretching past their tables and the noises for most of the evening. But that was not my problem. But standing outside the toilet for a while I had a chance to see the adjacent kitchen only a couple of feet away,. A chef was making little pasties or burgers of some sort and after squeezing each one into shape with his bare hands, wiped his hands on the back of his trousers. I was horrified. Then it was my turn and I found the toilet awash with a few centimetres of fluid, the type of which I feared to contemplate. Fortunately I could stand to go but felt for any female who had to pass the test. It was filthy. To say this put me off the food I had just tasted was to put it mildly and I feared for the results, but survived the night relatively pain free.So in summary, a place that is trendy, has some funkiness, that certainly was well attended, but my impression of the hygiene, having worked in the medical field all my life, left everything to be desired. Singapore street stalls are cleaner and so even are the primitive places I have eaten in Afghanistan and other strhage places... Only eat here if you have a cast iron stomach and excellent health and life insurance...

premise - design is way beyond cool! loved the decor 100%. We went to the resto and also the Bar @ Lvl 8 (this has the awesome view from the angle hardly seen by many) rendezvous encouraging resto due to off beat location. :)location - in this old building that looks normal from the outside but the inside?! thumbs up!! carpark can be a pain however.staff - well mannered and all smilescrowd - many expats here, seemed like every table had 1. some mid sized groups 6-8pax. food - portion was fair enough for the amount of money paid. drinks were on the high side though.verdict - come once a month if you must. bring a lady to impress. bring friends who will be louder than the expats cos the latter are loud. the Kilo Bar @ Lvl 8 was nice and quiet when we were there and the view was great as well. and oh, you may want to increase your credit card credit limit should you go for drinks. :

This place is fashionable among the Anglo Saxons customers. Situated along Rochor River besides a green park, an unconventional and interesting location. The resturant is on the second floor. We have to walk up the unkept stairway and entered the resturant from the back door, greeted by a group of smoking and chatting crew having their pre-dinner break, as the elevator was out of order. What a bad first impression for the diners! The restaurant has a contemporary setting, no air-condition, concrete floor and Bristol furnitures. We brought a bottle of wine, and was told that their corkage is S$60!! So we end up ordering wine from their limited selection. The taste of their food is acceptable and the presentation is interesting. After ++ Average price for starter $23, main range from $37, Dessert $10 (a slice of mass-produced lemon tart cost $12) , Coffee/Tea $7. This below average experience cost more than $80 per head. I might return when they have improved their service and food, as the location is unique
5
This restaurant is simple in its decor, its food offering, its wine list but everything is done so well that for me it is one of the best that Singapore has to offer if you like to eat in a lively environment. All of their sharing plates are very good and for Singapore the prices are reasonable. I highly recommend this place if out with a group of friends and you are looking for a night of good drinks and food that you can share

Kilo was a genuine treat. We walked 15 minutes from the MRT and, although it's not well signposted, all was forgiven as we settled in with a beautiful Sake sangria while we waited for friends. The renovated former factory makes for a large and uncluttered room, simply furnished and decorated with a small bar and nice tunes. The food was impressive throughout the three and a half hours we spent there, from moreish stuffed figs or baby squid for starters, through to the very well-executed steaks, pastas and lamb for the mains. The sides, including a number of really good salads, also shone. We rounded things off with a cracking lemon tart, an on-the-money chocolate fondant and a really unusual but delicious basil ice cream. Service was attentive but unobtrusive. Definitely somewhere to revisit next time we're back in the Lion City
4
We too saw the Anthony Bourdain video and everything look soooo good. So this was a night to splurge however it was still a bit more than expected especially for the dÃ©cor....very simple, but a nice river view. We shared the scallop appy, would like to see the price adjusted for 6 not 5. I think most people are here in couples. I had the salmon that was amazing! One of the best ever...and I get the fresh caught Canadian wild salmon often. My friend had the beef ribs which were fine, but don't expect big bones of beef. We shared a dessert and enjoyed the one big night for just under $200 with a bottle of wine. Luckily cabs are cheap in Singapore so this out of the way place did not cost too much to get to, you just don't realize you are there when the cab stops at a gate and apartment looking building with no sign. Just go through and take the elevator up a floor
4
Second visit in 14 months, nice addition with a balcony section looking over the river.Had a table for two on the balcony, the view was tranquil.More importantly the food and service was what I rembered 14 months ago.Started with raw Tuna rolls, main of 24hr cooked Pork and purple mash finnished with chocolate lava cake.Service was top notch and obliging.If we lived in Singapore it would be a regular
5
We have lived in Singapore for 7 years and Kilo is one of our favorite restaurants anywhere. The menu selection focuses on many Asian-fusion dishes including delicious tartars and ceviches. Ingredients are fresh and dishes innovative. One of the owners is always on site to meet and greet, and the atmosphere is elegantly laid back, pared with great service. We highly recommend Kilo for any occasion, and have been greatly satisfied as regular patrons of this establishment
5
This restaurant was featured on one of Anthony Bourdain's shows and my husband and I decided to check it out. Firstly, book days in advance if you want a reservation on the weekend because it fills up fast! We visited on a Friday and sat at the bar bc they were fully booked. After talking to the bartender we realized that he was actually the owner. He was very nice and welcoming. The staff was so friendly and the food was spectacular. We really enjoyed the pork rib-lets, zucchini pancakes and the stuffed figs. One our best dining experiences in Singapore. We will definitely be back
5
I had a fairly large birthday gathering on the weekend at Kilo and the staff were amazing. They were very accommodating and food and drinks kept flowing. We ordered a set menu of a range of items and they were all delicious. Especially the BBQ Pork Riblets that were cooked to perfection and the Blue Corn Crusted Crab cakes. The atmosphere was very relaxed and it was so nice to find a venue off the beaten track, that was central Singapore but felt like we could be anywhere. The upstairs bar was a great surprise (which I never knew existed). It had a great vibe and was so convenient for us to continue celebrations. Will definitely go here again
5
We shared the blue corn crusted crab cakes with basil vinaigrette, and roasted red pepper relish; and the salt and pepper crispy baby squid with chipotle mayo and lemon ginger aioli. Yum!Then came the grilled lamb rack, marsala wine reduction, rosemary baby potatoes, and honey glazed roasted carrots; and the 24 hour pork belly with purple potato mash, sour cream, and pork crackling. Yum!Finally the chocolate lava cake with walnuts, ice-cream and strawberries. Speechless!Great ambience, a combination of rustic and cutting edge with concrete floors and windows open along the full length of the room allowing in the gentle breezes off the Singapore river.It's in Kampong Bugis and off the well-worn retail or tourist track, so take a taxi there and back
5
This restaurant is a bit away from the Centre city but two stops on the mrt and a short stroll along the river were worth it. It's in the only large building in the area so easy to find but there are no signs . Even the lift just had K on the button.The restaurant is eclectic. Concrete floors, a mix of glass and wooden tables, paper napkins, chopsticks and knives and forks in a wooden box. We had table overlooking the river where the breeze drifted through the hanging plants. The atmosphere was relaxed and buzzy. We could watch the chefs in the kitchen.The food was very good. We opted to share a fig and quinoa salad, salt and pepper squid, ravioli and pork ribs. The salad was a lovely mix of flavors and textures. The pomegranate seeds exploded in your mouth. Squid was crisp and flavourful with two interesting sauces the pasta was a mix of plain and inked with a well flavored filling and the ribs fell off the bones. All were well executed dishes.The service was friendly and highly efficient. Wait staff were continually checking water/wine/clearing empty plates without being intrusive.my only negative is the limited choice of wine by the glass, only 2 red and 2 white.an excellent evening out, $S 120 for 2 with 2 wines. Not cheap but very good value. Highly recommended as a night of good food away from the bustle of the city.If you are visiting be aware that the bridge over the river next to the restaurant is closed for repair until late 2014. We walked from lavender mrt, crossed Crawford road and then along the side of the river on which kilo is located. Maybe 10 mins slow walk, well lit at night and a nice stroll after dinner
5
Absolutely loved dinner at Kilo. From our seared ahi tuna and salmon sushi to short ribs and spicy tuna the serves we're plentiful and extremely tasty. Wine list was respectable and well priced. We went with the babich sav blanc from NZ for $58.Dessert was epic, chocolate lava cake with vanilla I've cream was amazing!
5
We tried Kilo restaurant thanks to our friend from Singapore. Was hard to find but really worth it! The restaurant itself is cozy and different from what you can find in Singapore. Open air and by the river. Cool ambiance. Food is just awesome. We tried several dishes to share. Tuna tartar is a must try, the quinoa salad was also really tasty and well balanced.We had duck , beef and pork for mains. They were all cooked at perfection! . We ended with the chocolate lava cake... to die for.The wine selection is really good. Thank you KILO for this wonderful dining experience
4
Loved the place..... a little pricey but the quality of food made up for it.I was just disappointed with the washroom- it was dark and dirty.. toilet paper strewn all over.It was a bit of a put-off.Being a vegetarian, there were just 3 dishes for us.It would be great if a few more options would be made available
3
Kilo is just a great place to chill out with friends and has fusion cuisine which is amazing. I usually go during the week: good atmosphere, fab service and food of a super high quality. However went for the first time on a week end: the place was too loud, service not as good and the food was way less tasty than usual :( My recommendation: go on week days!
5
hands down one of the best restaurants in singapore: no mall setting but in a kind of HDB, no business people, a nice mix of hipsters and professionals, and GREAT FOOD.The crabcakes are probably some of the best i have ever had. The squid rice, as well as the porkbelly are awesome. We had some mojitos to accompany the food
4
Nice, simple menu with very tasty and creative options. It was somewhat difficult to find if you've never been there, but once you take the elevator to the second floor of an unassuming building on the water, you are met with a cool, little place with a hipster vibe and some very good fusion options.The only downside to this place was the noise level. The restaurant looks like a refurbished room in a warehouse, so there is a lot of exposed concrete. When the place fills up, the lack of sound absorbing material creates quite a cacophony. However, the atmosphere and food make up for it. It's a good place for friends, a date, or a business dinner
4
A cool restaurant with plenty of buzz. The food was good, not fine dining but certainly above average. The location is a little out of the way, so be sure to have good instructions as to how to get there at night. Easy to get taxi's to and from the restaurant. This location adds to the atmosphere - an old building, and the restaurant is high enough up to get some views over the small river and there is good air flow with open windows, potted plants etc. the music is not too loud, and the staff are friendly and professional. Good to eat here if you are searching for something a little more 'real' than some of the bigger Singapore eateries
4
We were alerted to this place via another restaurant's maitre d'. and we were not disappointed. The location, in the park, is spacious but also feels secluded. The menu was interesting and the service was prompt and knowledgeable. My partner and I will definitely be back soon
5
Its such a treat to go to a restaurant in Singapore where the food is great, and the service lives up to the same standard. I was very impressed. Firstly the venue is an unexpected tucked away place which makes it feel like a hidden treasure. The menu was so good that our group decided to go for the sharing platters so that we could try a little of a lot of things.(Try the Zucchini pancakes with iberico ham - my favourite).Xavier, the owner walkerd around greeting guests and making sure everyone was having a good time. I haven't seen that happen terribly often in my 3 years in Singapore. Will definitely go back. Alos - look out he is openeing a very cool lounge on the 8th floor in the next few weeks. Will definitely become a very popular venue
5
Our friends that lives here in Singapore invited us to "Kilo". Amazing place! It is located in the middle of "nowhere" if you can say that in Singapore. Make sure you have the address and phone number to the restaurant available for the taxi driver as there is no signs on the house where the restaurant is. Upon arriving, its located on the second floor in a residential / office building.The food is outstanding and we shared only cold and warm starters among us. Make sure to try the scallops, pork ribs and tuna tartar. We can strongly recommend
4
Avoid all of the central Singapore hassle and go to Katong Bugis for some great fayre. Kilo has a great menu with delicious fusion food. We normally just have half a dozen starters to share rather than mains as there are so many great things to try
5
Excellent fusion cuisine mixed between asian and western.To be highly recommended and don't befraid if taxi isvaskung twice if it'sth right wayPlace is not that show off but kitchen's talent is making the hit !For sure il will be back with my friends to mae them discover this talentec chef 
5
We went there for my Bday and the experience was excellent. From the time of the booking until the Bday cake and even the shake of hands with the manager at the hand, everything was flawless! Not to mention the food is REALLY tasty and unique. Highly recommended!
3
Was at kilo with 3 other friends. The food was really average only except for the wasabi tuna tartare Service was Ok. Appetizers are mostly vegetables and fruits with all kind of mixtures nothing special. Just taste weird when you have a bunch of mixed taste all at once in a mouthful. Maybe I am not a person who likes too much fusion on my food. Food wise I feel is overrated. Wines list was good so we ordered a bottle of wine to enjoy the nice ambience.
4
Kilo is a really nice place. Food is simple and delicious. Staff is really nice. The sharing concept is really well done. I recommend it for a couple dinner!
5
We went here for after work team dinner and I loved the setting. absolutely loved it. It was an open air setting and had a rustic feel to it. And It was quite comfortable even in the singapore heat in September. I wrote to their reservations team and they were very prompt at getting back and helped me pick and choose a menu for the group as well. Dave is the person I communicated with and he was awesome! Here's what we had and everything WAS OMG AWESOME!To BeginSeared Scallops in Mushroom Sauce with Cherry TomatoesFig-walnut Quinoa with Rocket, Goat’s Cheese & Pomegranate VinaigretteParmesan & Mozzarella Portabello Mushroom with BaconBBQ Riblets & Roasted Parmesan PotatoesMains12-hour Pork Belly with Purple Mash & CracklingLemongrass-Ginger Baked Salmon & Fragrant Basil RiceAngel Hair with Cream of Ebiko & PrawnsFresh Veggie Salad with roasted Asparagas, Zucchini, Capsicum and PortobelloDessertLemon Tart with CreamChocolate Lava Cake with Vanilla Ice creamThe staff was really helpful as well and made sure we had a good time. They also have a great selection of wines. The only downside is that it's quite deep inside from the main road and getting a taxi on your way back from there can be troublesome

I always have doubts about the food from any shop that is based on the concept of food and fashion retail. However, Kilo@Pact is an exception case because the food, especially those from the brunch menu are truly delicious. That said Though it was meant to be a brunch gathering, we ended having more ala carte items then brunch items. 1st reason was because brunch service is only available after 12.30pm although the restaurant opens at 11.30am. 2nd, the brunch menu had only 5 items.For full post, visit http://dairycream.blogspot.jp/2013/09/kilopact-brunch-or-lunch.htmlThe following two dishes were quite normal and did not excite me. The Ahi Mango Poke with Deep fried Wanton skin$16 is raw tuna mixed with cucumber, shallots and mangoes to be self-filled into the wanton shells. The Salmon Avocado Sushiro ($15) is rolled up sushi served with Niigata rice served with plain-tasting soy flaxseed chips. I would skip this dish because it fell short of flavours.But the highlight of the day to me was the dish that I had picked with another dessert fan-The Banana Bites ($12). This was not your average French toast as it is so moist with cotton-like softness. Bananas have been mixed into the batter, which was already sweet enough so the maple syrup was rather unnecessary. At the same time, I really liked the Portobello Benedict ($21) because the black giant fungi worked amazingly well with the piquant buttermilk-mozzarella sauce that was smeared on toasted English muffin. I did not know what “secret ingredient” the chef put inside but the taste was interesting, especially when you have everything in a one mouthful......Full post on http://dairycream.blogspot.jp/2013/09/kilopact-brunch-or-lunch.htm

It's one of these rare finds you hesitate to rave about for fear that you will not be able to secure a table the next time you wish to dine there. We've been fans of this diner since their initial debut at Upper Bukit Timah - Raw Kitchen. Their prices are reasonable and provide good value for money. Dishes that we must have are their tuna tartare, zucchini pancake, seared scallops, chili-lime spicy pork salad, salt & pepper squid and Lambrack. The proprietors, Javier and Sharon and very friendly and accommodating - Kudos to them. Dining at this location is a treat and I look forward to each visit. Tip: Do make a reservation to avoid disappointment as their tables get booked up every evening

Kilo is great. It was recommended by a client who used to live in Singapore and did not disappoint. It's located on level 2 of a nondescript building a bit removed from the main streets (look for the discrete K signboard). Our taxi driver was adamant that we had the wrong address and made us call to confirm. We were 30 mins early but were welcomed in. The place felt like an oasis - clean minimalist decor, open balcony to the river. Wine list was diverse and reasonable. Food was brilliant - UFO gyoza, tuna mango poke, scallops, ceviche, pork riblets. All interesting and delicious. Dave at front of house is super friendly and helpful. You will need to book a few days in advance.
5
I have been several times to Kilo now, mostly taking guests who are visiting, and everyone I have taken has loved it. The wine is not too pricey, their prosecco (which is decent) is $55++ - a far cry from many restaurants in the CBD which are at least 1/3 more expensive. The staff are really friendly and are very attentive with keeping glasses topped up etc.The tuna tartare with wasabi, avocado and sesame, the chilli and prawn pizza (spicy!) and the BBQ pork riblets are all excellent. I've not had any of the main courses because it's so much fun sharing the starters amongst the table. Both the desserts are delicious. The lava cake really does work with the basil ice cream - who knew?! Lemon tart is equally as good. It's a pretty casual and chilled out place, which is a nice change, bear in mind that without air con it can get pretty warm so you're maybe better to wear something loose/cool. With a decent amount of food (say, two starters per pax, dessert and wine), the bill is around $70-80pp

For pics and an in depth review, please visit my blog here: http://www.treatsandmeats.com/blog/2013/7/17/kiloI've heard such amazing things about Kilo from colleagues, friends, magazines, reviews (everywhere, really!), and was absolutely dying to try it. Unfortunately, I was completely disappointed and didn't think it lived up to the hype at all. We were served by a waitress who seemed completely blase and disinterested in answering any of our questions. The food was decent, but definitely not mind blowing. Our favourite dish of the night was the avocado wasabi tuna tartare, which was incredibly fresh and perfectly balanced by the creamy avocado. The crispy squid, on the other hand, had way too much batter on it causing it to become soggy really fast. Lastly, their 12 hour roasted pork belly wasn't as succulent as we'd hoped and the pork cracklings which accompanied it were too big and chewy to bite into!The decor was incredibly raw and minimalistic, which was quite refreshing but not really my cup of tea. To find out more of my thoughts on their dishes as well as what interesting concoction arrived when we ordered the gyoza, please visit my blog above
4
The food is interesting and tasty. Great to share several "starter" plates with friends over a bottle of wine or two. Unfortunately they don't serve cocktails, as a pre dinner mojioto would have been perfect. We also found the prices acceptable. Although we shared about 7 dishes, there are still other dishes that I would like to try and will keep ordering. Their zucchini pancakes with goat cheese and rocket are delicious as well as their baked figs stuffed with blue cheese! I'd skip the shrimp giant gyoza next time though. (PS Getting to the venue on Friday in peak hour traffic is a bit challenging, unless you come from East Coast - so allow extra time

My family & I went to Kilo to celebrate my brother’s birthday. The reservation was made a day ahead via email since the place only opens at 6pm. However, they were quick to respond even I had to increase the number of guests to 8. This was my second visit & based on experience, reservation is a must if you are really keen to dine here. The crowd started streaming in after 7. We saw a group of about 6-8 people coming without reservations & they had to leave disappointed. For starters to share we had the salmon sushi which was stuffed with crispy chicken skin & RAW’s seafood ceviche. We were licking off the dressing for the ceviche. Both were so appetizing that we were wishing the portions were bigger. The chilli-line spicy pork salad was indeed spicy. Chilli padi was used in the mix. There was more pork than rockets. It was another yummy starter.For the mains, some of us had starters. There was no beef shortribs that day. However, we were recommended to try the riblets instead. Despite it being listed as a starter, it was suitable for a main dish. The tender meat literally fell off the bone. Some of us also had seared scallops in mushroom sauce. It was served in a cream white wine sauce that was slightly sweet on its own. The sweetness was balanced out by the natural flavours of the scallops & mushrooms. The 12 hour pork belly was a generous portion by my standards & I shared mine. The meat was tender & juicy. Instead of a mash, there were purple wedges. It went deliciously well with the sour cream. The tenderloin was moist & pink. The quinoa was slightly sweet on its own. But it was served with roasted pumpkin & goat’s cheese. The cheese helped unsweetened the quinoa. The pizza was perfectly thin crusted & could be easily shared between 2-3 people.We tried the lava cake with red apple & carrot ice cream. The ice cream was orangey & was more carroty than expected. However, mix that with some of the molten chocolate, perfect. The staff volunteered to put a candle on the cake since there was a birthday being celebrated.The place had a very chill out vibe. Not too many tables to over crowd the place. But because of all the concrete, it can get a little noisy. On the whole we enjoyed dinner. We spent about S$360 altogether. I definitely recommend this place for the food
5
The starters were for sharing, there were 4 of us so we tried most, all were excellent. We then shared 3 mains, the duck was my favourite , the pork belly coming in a close second. Managed to fit in Lemon Lime Tarts 2 per serve , this too excellent. Restaurant also BYO wine
5
Take a taxi or you may not find it. it's worth the detour. We ended up having only their appetizers - they were SO good! And we enjoyed the open setting without the usual chilly a/c found everywhere in Singapore.
4
Cosy and relax ambience - breezy despite not having aircon. Food is awesome - tasty & unique. We have the tuna tartare, day & night braised pork and chocolate lave for dessert. One of my friends is vegetarian, the chef made a vegetarian pasta for her and it is heavenly....the staff are very friendly and helpfu

Kilo is tucked away in an old area of Singapore, inside a very old, standalone building that has been refurbished inside while retaining the old rustic charm on the exterior. Kilo is on the second floor and once the lift opened, we saw a very well spaced and cosy restaurant. There is no air-conditioning but it is very open and ceiling fans keep the place very well ventilated. We both liked the restaurant very much.We had called ahead to reserve a table and was seated quickly. Although their squid ink rice and 12-hour pork are the famous main courses to go for, we decided to go for lighter fare. We had the ceviche, tuna tartare, seared scallops and roasted vegetables pizza. We highly recommend all of them
5
We came across this restaurant by a recommendation, it is not a restaurant you would find by just walking by. It's located in a slightly "remote" location for Singapore, in a standalone building where there is not much else. It can be a challenge for taxi drivers to find this place if they don't know about it, make sure you have a map or the name of some nearby streets. The food is excellent, highly recommend the tuna tartare. The atmosphere is lovely, and it's a quite small place, make sure you book in advance! Will definitely be visiting again on our next visit to Singapor
4
Food: we took raw seafood options like the cerviche and the tuna tartare. Fresh and good. Always a good sign when restaurants take their fresh ingredients like these (and salads) seriously! Ambience: lovely industrial deco. For once i was not freezing an indoor air conditioning space. the air and energy flow was perfect as the wide windows on both sides of the resto are fully opened up, letting natural evening breeze and ceiling fans do their work Value: Not to exorbitant for the good food served! Service: just ok. looks like there are more than enough staff walking around but they don't seem to be too attentive. not a deal breaker tho
5
We went there for a birthday and the service was great, from booking to the end. The food was amazing and flavors were "au rendez vous" . The lounge music was a bonus and the atmosphere was relaxed and unusual. Go for it, you wont be disappointed
5
Located in an unusual building block but it's a hidden gem well worth seeking out. The food is superb, service fantastic, they even allow BYO wine. The food is great for sharing. The place is small and get's booked far in advance. They also host cool parties if you follow them on Facebook. The setting is industrial urban chic. Don't miss this absolute gem
4
This is an out-of-the-way place, on the second floor of a building with an open, airy feel. It has fans, not air-con and so is relatively casual, though there was a mix of fashion the night we were there. The menu is reasonably extensive, the wine list less so. Service was friendly, though I have to deduct a mark or two for making use reuse our cutlery - not really on given the prices; plus a glass of red wine came straight from the fridge - if its house-pour it should be at room temperature, or slightly chilled at most. The food, however, was delicious, with good portions and some inventive pairings. A very interesting find and worth a return visit, perhaps with friends, so that more of the shared plates can be sampled

What a great little hidden gem, I thought I was eating in a multi storie car park when I arrived, not easy to find but if you like great food at a reasonable cost then find this place, even the taxi drivers have problems finding it.We shared a lot of different dishes and the flavours were superb, I just love the way they use flavours you would never think to mix, and the outcome is delicious. Make a point of booking a table don't just turn up as they are very busy

Kilo is a restaurant on the second floor of a commercial building that stands by itself near the Lavender stop on the EW (Green) MRT line. There is no sign when you arrive at 66 Kampong Bugis, but you can see diners eating on the second floor, and hear the din of the restaurant. We too the clunky elevator up a flight (we couldn't find the stairs) and emerged into a room that is open to the breeze on both long ends. This was delightlful on a cool Singapore evening. We arrived on a Wednesday without a reservation and were told that not only were they all booked that night they were booked the next, but had seats at the bar two nights later. We took the seats. The clientele were mostly young Singporeans. When we arrived two days later they actually found us a table. The food is Japanese-French fusion, with very interesting combinations - we had a duck salad and a tartare as starters, fish and beef as mains, but the desserts were too eclectic to be appealing. The food was surprisingly good. The wine list was interesting but we opted for an excellent sake.

I just went to this restaurant with my house-mates this evening. Very interesting place with good service & great food. The starters were great too!
Thoroughly enjoyed myself.
5
Loved the atmosphere and quirkiness of the place. Ordered the ribs and they were to die for. Also recommended was the crackling pork belly, and the tuna tartar. Nice drinks and wine list also good.

The location is not so intuitive but the restaurant is great. If you are sharing different startes or ordering a main - all dishes are excellent. As mentioned before, its a French - Japanese combination but you can also just dine in one country style only. The atmosphere is really nice. Yes the service can still improve (very friendly but sometimes the wait is long) but I mean come one... this is Singapore. I dont think there are many really excellent restaurants around that want you to go back over and over again but this is definitely one of them. Try it it - hard to describe

I have tried for weeks to get a table at this restaurant and finally went there on Saturday. The raw food (we ordered three types of raw fish dishes) is very good and so is the basil pizza. We had many different starters to share and skipped the mains. The beef rib was also good. Seats are a bit uncomfortable and the table felt very low but it had a good laid back atmosphere

Didn't expect to find such a lovely restaurant at a "deserted" area. I am pleasantly surprised. The cab driver had difficulty searching for the place. Thank goodness my girl friend is pretty familiar with the area, so, she led the cab driver to the location of the restaurant. The place is quiet, not elaborately decorated, the service staff are friendly & accommodating and the food is surprisingly very good. Reservation is a must because this restaurant is always fully booked. My friends & I were there at 6.30pm for dinner & that's a good time because you can have the place to your own as the crowd will start to come in around 8pm. Be prepared to spend approx $50/person (without alcohol) for 3 appetizers & 3 main courses

I planned a trip to Singapore to celebrate a major birthday with old friends, one of whom arranged for me a dinner for 12 at Kilo. I have to admit I was a bit dubious when she said she'd arranged share plates for starters and desserts, and could we choose our mains in advance, but it couldn't have worked out better! (NOTE: this was just because of the size of the party)We got to try tons of dishes, all I had were fabulous and the only complaint I heard all evening was that the lemon tart was a bit sweet for some (I didn't try it, I was a total pig and ate a whole chocolate lava cake to myself so I really couldn't manage another bite).Food is only part of a dining experience and I'm pleased to report the service was also great - not always a given in Singapore (where I lived for some years). The waiter certainly looked after us all, made sure my glass was always topped up, and put up with me moving seats all the time to catch up with everyone :) It's very well-priced for the quality too.The venue is really funky - I'm a sucker for a polished concrete floor. It's definitely off the beaten track but not at all far from the city, although I would recommend making sure the taxi uncle knows it's along Kallang Rd, and you turn in next to the temple just after Crawford St. (It's a sort of light industrial area near the river.) I'm no longer used to the humidity and I'd read there is no aircon but it is very open so didn't cause a problem at all.I wish there were more places like Kilo when I lived there - great food and service in a relaxed atmosphere without stuffiness and top dollar prices

Am on a mission to give credibility to TA food reviews for Singapore. For such a foodie country to have as its top rated resto a place I have never heard of let alone visited is just bizarro. Anyway Kilo Kitchen deserves its good reviews. Lovely cute and quirky Jap-fusion menu in an interesting setting. It's out of the way. If driving in the direction of the city, turn at the big Hindu temple. Resto is in a white building on the 2nd floor. Try the squid ink pasta if on the menu. Steak was superb (and good value for expensive Singapore). Bartender/ sommelier recommended a Portuguese wine which we loved. I wish they opened for brunch!Ps dress cool, place is open and fan only, no air-con

Visited recently with friends and it was a delightful evening. The location is interesting - wasn't sure what to expect when the cab took us away from the hustle and bustle and drove us along a road that wound through some overgrown looking small fields to a dilapidated looking building...once the lift opened I was in for a pleasant surprise! what a cool space! Minimal, quirky and well thought out. Staff were friendly and attentive and the food was excellent. We opted to share a selection of small plates. Loved the pairing of Italian and Japanese flavours! Sight disappointment at desert as they were out of the basil icecream which had come highly recommended but other than that it was an amazing meal. I will definitely return when next I visit Singapore

Had been meaning to go forever, but finally made it to Kilo for a friends bday dinner. We ordered a ton of the starters as well as a few mains to share. Generally everything was good, no major misses. We loved: tuna tartare, ceviche, fresh figs, short ribs, prawn gyoza, lamb chops. The squid ink rice, salt and pepper prawns, tenderloin, spicy pork salad also were good. Good and reasonable wine selection, simple but good cocktails. Great vibe -- dark, second floor of old building (maybe an old HDB block), minimalist, a bit hip warehouse feel to it. Also a bar w four chairs. Would definitely return with date, friends, etc who want to get out of the usual spots.

Before finally trying Kilo, I had heard from many people about how great it was. And luckily, it lived up to the hype. Tucked in away on the second floor of a building that my taxi uncle kept swearing to me was empty and abandoned, Kilo is a surprisingly great setting. The menu is a unique fusion of Japanese and Italian inspired dishes. I suggest dinning with at least 4 people, so that you can justify ordering more and more dishes to share. We ordered almost everything on the menu, and loved everything. Restaurant books up, so book early

Loved the food. Just wish all the food came at the same time. Would have been nice to eat WITH my wife.

Tucked away in Kampong Bugis is a small restaurant. It is a relatively recent addition to the plethora of food options in Singapore. The day we were there for dinner the place was buzzing. It has a good vibe and food that is innovative and unique. The young chefs are trying to do something creative and different. They still have some way to go but the seeds of greatness are being sown and nurtured. The menu is predominantly non vegetarian so vegetarians have limited choices. The music is good, the setting is simple but charming. Service is very good and they stock some decent wines
5
Kilo's design sets it apart from other restaurants in Singapore. Nested in an old building, open air, with no AC, and with uber cool design, Kilo is the perfect choice to show that you know Singapore's alternative culinary offerings. The location next to the river and surrounded by trees gives it a special vibe. The fusion menu (japanese+European influence) is amazing, the only weakness being the lack of veggie choices. Make sure you book in advance, the seating is limited and you might have to wait for an hour to get a table.

We had read such glowing reviews of Kilo and were disappointed with our overall experience. The service was poor and one of the persons working there was most unfriendly as we had arrived early for our reservation. He did not want us waiting at the restaurant and we had to leave and come back again to be seated. Even at the time of our reservation when we had returned, customers for the first seating were not informed that customers for the second seating had arrived. We had to stand around and wait for an additional 20 minutes and were not offered any drinks or appetizers or a hint of an apology. The food itself was mediocre (we had the sushi, salmon and pork), portions were small. It was also swelteringly hot as there was no airconditioning and sadly no cross wind that night. The famous stewed pork dish was tasty, however our parents remarked that it reminded them greatly of the canned 'Ma Ling Pork' which they ate during their childhood.I'm not sure why this restaurant has garnered such amazing reviews but we are definitely not inclined to go back again to find out

Kilo is located just out of the city, in a very very quiet location. I almost missed it although that was the only building there. Food was great, we had the scallops, tuna tartare, ebiko angel hair pasta and the pork belly. No complains there.Ambience wise, the chairs could use a change, really uncomfortable, doesn't allow you to sit for long, and it's not air conditioned... Remember to dress light....Worth the 1 week wait list... But I'm pretty sure you can get a table if you go at abt 9pm.

Back when the restaurant was known as Raw Kitchen Bar, we were already in love with the food. I was heartbroken when they moved & no idea to where. After months of searching, I found out it's now known as Kilo @ Kampong Bugis which is 10 min drive from my workplace! The location of the restaurant is quite out of the way so do google the place before heading there. It will save you a lot of time. It located at the 2nd floor. No air-con but they do have super strong fans that will mess up your hair. Back to the food. The food is amazing!! The combination of Italian & Japanese food is creative and I am not sure if I can get it anywhere else. I love the Balsamic Duck Leg. Do note that they take a while to serve the food. So you might not be eating at the same time. Best is the share.Also do make a reservation

After tasting the food serve, u can feel the passion the cook has for the food to be carefully cook, plated and nicely presented. The atmosphere is simple but with care given to the customer. Customer focus seems to be the restaurant strategy. The place is a bit difficult to find and there is also a restaurant at level 1. If not sure of the place, best to go with a sat nav if driving
4
This is a little out of town, but worth the trip.There is a very happening bar downstairs crammed with expats (European, Brits and Americans) a live DJ and a little BBQ, the music was still very loud upstairs but we enjoyed the atmosphere.Around 9 covers it pays to book in advance or be prepared to go at either end of the service (we were there for 6.45)A super simple menu for both F&B but what we had was delicious and well presented, it comes out when it's ready, so it's rather eclectic dining experience. I guess the menu changes frequently so little point to share what we had, but seafood was excellent and coming from Dubai we always gravitate towards anything porky; also great
5
Also there on April 29th there was very loud music from the ground floor but we were a big table of 13 and didn't notice so much. The food was fantastic and whlst there are other places in Singapore that offer the same quality, they do cost three to four times as much. We shared every starter and most of the main courses and the flavour and tastes coming through were really delicious. I will definitely be back

Granted we went on a Monday night (although it was a holiday the following day), so perhaps it wasn't the normal staff. The service was disappointing although attentive enough (unlike most Singapore restaurants), however it just missed - eg they kept us waiting for an hour to serve the mains because one of our party had chosen an appetiser to have as a main - a fact we told them 3 times but still, they didn't serve the mains until after she had finished.The food was great - but again, a slight miss with 3 of the mains selections not available. But the food they did have was beautifully cooked with great ingredients, complimented by a good winelist (which again, had some items not available).We will try it again, and hope they have their A game on next tim

We reserved a table one month in advance for a going away party with 8 people. When we arrived, there was a loud party on the first floor blasting music the whole night. That wasn't the fault of the restaurant and they were accommodating by moving our table. However, once we tried to order it was hard to find a server. We waved and flagged someone down, then the drinks arrived but no food for a long time. Finally the food came, one plate at a time over the course of 2 hours! It was ridiculous and laughable at the same time. We complained, but the kitchen just couldn't get themselves together. The wait staff were waiting for the food with us. When the food came, it was disappointing, all of the appetizers were in the same salad with the same dressing. The portions were significantly smaller than our last visit 2 months ago. The quality just wasn't as good as the last time we visited even though the menu had not changed. I will never go back and can only hope for the restaurant that this was a bad night in the kitchen because if they won't be open long if they want to give that quality and service at such a high price.Kilo is now on my list of the "caro y malo" (expensive and bad) restaurants in Singapore

You'd have to know about Kilo from friends to go there - well off the beaten trac, take a taxi - but oh so we'll worth it when you arrive! Not what you expect, an open room on the 2nd floor of what looks like a 20 year old industrial building, but don't let that put you off! Food is to die for, and staff really friendly and helpful. A totally different dining experience among all the bling of Singapore

Chose kilo from Tripadvisor reviews which sometimes is tricky. This one hit bullseye - the ratings are comments are spot on. Food is excellent, creative dishes, nicely matched flavors and the service is spot on. Atmosphere is relaxed industrial, something we prefer over the starchy formality in high end food temples. Prices are very acceptable for the quality although the portions may be a bit on the small side for someone who's not had lunch. 2 Glasses of wine, one shared appetizer, 2 mains and a shared desert added up to $125 incl. tax and service charge. Well worth it, we'll be back

Belated review. Came here with my partner and some friends, one of whom knows the (very friendly) female co-owner. Bit of a trek from the nearest bus-stop (mid-week evening peak hour decided us against a taxi) but google maps made navigation a breeze.Located in an ex-industrial/ old HDB complex beside an overgrown field exuding slightly rustic, run-down charm. Completely safe, of course, being in Singapore.Restaurant nestled within cocoon of design ateliers and off-beat studios. The evening was soft and coolly breezy, candles bathed everyone in a fuzzy glow (helped by the excellent wines recommended by the male owner), the other tables were contentedly occupied by a mixed, relaxed crowd (designer types, after-work professionals, deliberately-scruffy, carefully-underdressed fund kids with their still-hip, worldly parents, and, happy, everyday folk), and the food comprised high-quality ingredients thrown together in extremely competent, and in some cases spectacular ways.Definitely worth the hike.

Next to Kallang River, this is a spartan restaurant for those who are looking for good food to hang out with friends in a laid back atmosphere. The 3 of us shared 3 appetizers, 3 entrees and the same Basil ice cream dessert. Our verdict? the food is very good, but not nearly so outstanding that it is worth making a special effort to ferret it out. Among the appetizers, the tuna tartare with light crackers was hands-down the best dish. The fish is fresh, the flavors subtle and the juxtaposition of tuna with light, airy, crispy crackers sublime. The rest of the food were very good - they are all 'oh so soft' that the meats glide off the bones. The braised duck leg was a good example.. Salmon wrapped with Nori was the weakspot. "Nothing special to write home about". Service was neighborhood friendly and the bill very reasonable. On a Monday night, half the tables were filled. We know that the place is normally packed during weekends. So call ahead unless you can go on a Monday night

I love the open setting on the second floor with the tiny lift. Casual seating and a party atmosphere - I can see why there was a wedding there the first time we tried to go. Some exotic spirits make for great cocktails and there is an excellent wine list. Friendly staff help to make this feel very welcoming. The food is magnificent and we booked to come back before we left. I dream about the house we want to build having an open covered area like this. Looking forward to our next trip there

As residents in Singapore, we are always interested in finding great restaurants that don't bust the bank - and Kilo is one of these rare places. A smallish, spartan space with only nine tables in an old housing block (now all funked up), Kilo does not impress at first sight - however the place is buzzing and the food was exceptional. We shared the bacon wrapped figs, zucchini and goats cheese pancake, and a beef shortrib. All were outstanding, but the portion of shortrib was short indeed - just 6 skinny little slivers that would make a sashimi chef blush. The lamb rack and tenderloin mains were great - generous portions perfectly seasoned and cooked. Pure class. My only other gripe apart from the measly shortrib portion is the service...our fig starter was placed first, and then we didn't see the shortrib for another 20 minutes, and same story with the mains - my wife's lamb landed on the table a good 10 minutes before my steak. This was annoying. Nevertheless, this was a refreshingly different night out in a cool venue with great food - oh and the corkage charge for bringing your own wine is only $20, which made it even better...We still like P.S cafe, but Kilo is probably going to be our new weekend treat. We're going back in two weeks for the buzz, the breeze, and more bang for my bucks..

We meet some friends who are living around the area and we knew the owner from their previous engagement as "Row Kitchen Bar". And I am glad they made it again.The concept of the restaurant is excellent and very Singaporean - in the middle of an HDB. I think that has great style.A lot of dishes are taken over from the old menu but they are as good as they where. I still love the black-ink risotto the most, but can recommend all other dishes as well.Make a reservation - it is backed most of the time

My husband loved Raw Kitchen when it was open a couple years ago. Once we discovered Kilo, it turns out it's owned by the same restauranteur and is equally as awesome according to my husband. I did not go to Raw, but I've been to Kilo I think 5 times, so that's a pretty strong case that I love it. We were just there on Friday night, so let me rattle off a few things that are TDF: 1. Ahi Mango Moke2. Wasabi tuna tartare3. Stuffed mushroom with bacon4. Zuccini pancake 5. Their sushi roll 6. The quinoa that accompanies the steak7. Their NZ Pinot Noir8. The slow roasted porkCall far in advance for reservations. The restaurant does not have many tables, so if you don't have a reservation, you'll have to sit at the bar if there's room. Bring a hair tie if you have long hair--it's lovely, but it's an open air restaurant and can get a little breezy in a good way. Occasionally the restaurant might be out of things, but it happens when it's a small restaurant that doesn't order stock by the truckload. Just roll with it and enjoy the restaurant

after being away from Singapore for several years the F&B scene has changed for the better and all grown up! Kilo can happily sit amongst the cool and hip restaurants of the world. I only met Sharon but with her and her partner at the helm it can only get better! Well done for selecting such a fabulous space too. Just a shame I didn't have time to make my way through the menu. I hope there will be a next time
