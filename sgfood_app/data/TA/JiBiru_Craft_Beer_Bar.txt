5
Stopping by for just one beer before heading towards sleep.
6 beers on tap: local Singapore and other Asian
Huge selections of beer from bottles, but I prefer the tap
5
We had a mixed platter and it was all delicious, beer was good too. Service was efficient and speedy. Not too noisy and it was great to sit out in the warmth, instead of freezing air conditioning.
5
Amazing place for real.beer check out happy hour.. 4 beers 20sgd bargin grateful atmosphere servers are 10-10

Great spot to enjoy a huge variety of Japanese craft beers and relax while people watching. The service is superb!! Friendly and attentive without the pushy or hurry attitude you see in other places.

I came here as I was walking around. I ordered my food to a bit very welcoming staff. After waiting for an hour that same staff came over asking me if I was ok. I said well I’m waiting for my food. He went to check and told me it was in the way. I called the staff again and he told me it would be in few mins a he forgot to key in my meal. I had to wait an hour and a half for my food. DISGRACE!!! Not even an apology.

Great selection of Beer choices, you can find many beer you probably didn't know.Some beer are dry and bitter though.The Sapporo Beer somewhat tasted a bit dryer than usual.Outside along the passage of 313, but is a small place and most often lack of attention.The food are so-so only but what spoilt the night was it take 30mins to deliver the food we ordered! Just some skewers and not complicated stuff.Would not return..
4
We grabbed a couple of Japanese craft beers and four orders of yakitori plus edamame for the two of us for a light dinner, and it was the perfect combination. This is a lively spot, and sometimes the service was a bit indifferent, but we enjoyed the combination of flavors: We had the special pork belly, mushroom, beef cheeks, and savored it all. Not particularly expensive for Orchard Road, either. A fun spot to try things out
5
Visited on end of January 2017. Totally loved the place. Located outside on the street the place is hard to miss due to the stylish design and attractive beer pipes view. Had a couple of Japanese beers - extremely tasty and unusual. The staff is great and was ready to provide me with additional information, even though everything was written in the menu. Totally worth visiting!
5
If I would still be living here this would probably become my favorite beer/waterhole for a Saturday afternoon with a great selection of Japanese beers and isakaja style snacks. I was here twice during my holiday, one time service was horribly slow, the second time it couldn't have been faster. So good luck and cheers
5
Stopped for a few beers, great service and a good variety of interesting craft beers.
Happy hour prices were good too.
4
A great place to hang out with your friends for snacks and beers. Try out some of the beer like Echigo Stout and Hitachino Red too.
3
The Japanese beer list is pretty impressive, though they were out of many when I visited. Like many mall-located places in Singapore, it can be crowded and feels somewhat shoved along the walkway, but it is a nice respite from the mall itself.
3
On advice of a friend, had a post-business meeting here to try their Japanese craft beer. An excellent variety providing varying flavours and experiences. This was well complimented by decent yakitori options. A pleasant, relaxed environment.
4
After a month of local lagers it was great to sit down and have a selection of beer with a variety of flavours.
Enjoyed a tasting tray of Japanese beers plus a bottle.
Not the cheapest but very pleasant.
5
Often patronize this place to chill out with my besties. They have nice craft beer and food. The service staffs are also very friendly. It's definitely worth bringing more friends to chill in near future.
4
Out and about in Singapore we found this at the main door of the massive shopping centre at Somerset, what a fantastic selection of beer and you get a little taste of Japan into the bargain. Excellent menu for beers and drink and you get a happy hour as well, not the cheapest but you pay for what you get?Another recommendation from me, fantastic selection
4
Here's a little of Japan craft beers in Singapore at Singapore dollar prices (read expensive as it can be).Excellent quality beer menu and Japanese bbq located at the door of a busy trendy-ish mall.If you want to spend some time enjoying good beer with an outdoor feeling while snacking on well served bbq bites, this is your place.Service is excellent.I'll be back
3
Saw this on google and walked there on our first night in Singapore. Just went for a beer so didn't try the food. The beer was ok but they hike up the prices a lot as the evening goes on, so at nearly S$20 a pint it's not worth it for what is, after all, just keg beer. Go before 6pm if you want to try it
4
Came here cos we missing our Japanese beer, found some interesting delights here, this is our breakdown:Ambience: 4/5Cleanliness: 5/5Customer Service: 3.5/5Quality of Food: 4/5Value for Money: 4/5Our Orders:Yakitori Set Lunch: 4.5/5Sampling Beer Set: 4/5The Good: Nice ambience, Jap food turned out quite nice, beers were alright. It's alright to spend the afternoon here.The Bad: We thought the sampling set would offer more interesting beers, personally I preferred the Sapporo beers from Japan more compared to their sampling set. Yebiru was also not available. Bottom Line: We would come here again to try out the other drinks, however perhaps in the afternoons instead of the evenings. Recommend for beer hunters who wanna try something more exquisite from Japan here!
3
Came here for lunch. The set lunches here are pretty reasonably priced. However the taste was average. The Don Katsu was a bit too salty. Service was decent though.
4
Its a really nice place to just sit and enjoy some Japanese beer. Tried a few glasses of craft beer and I enjoyed it very much. Staff was friendly. Premise was clean and not too crowded. I would definitely revisit the place. Cheers!
2
Looked like a cool bar, They have great selection of beer, but the food is aweful! Old fish And no flavor to the BBQ food we got. Totally not worth the money! Don't even bother with so many other choices in Singapore
4
Popped in here for a quick beer tonight after work. Good selection of craft beer and reasonable prices before 8pm. Decent atmosphere also. Worth another visit.
4
It is a nice to see a place selling excellent craft beer in Singapore. We were not disappointed by the beer and enjoyed watching the stream of humanity passing by, however it turned about to be expensive after the 10% service charge and 7% GST were added. 32.70 Singapore Dollars for 2 beers seemed a bit expensive to us but I guess it is unusual to find such good Japanese craft beer
5
Located at the open parking lot of "313 Somerset". If you are coming via taxi then can get off at the "Orchard Central taxi stand" and take the glass door right infront of the taxi stand (once you get up), keep walking strait and come out of the last glass door to reach this place. Its not in the aircon area so can have a open air dining experience and that is how you actually enjoy a ice cold beer. A great place to handout with friends or family. If you are beer lover try the Hitachino White Ale and combine with chicken karaage, a must have
4
Just saw how some clients having a tasting of Japan Beer in small chilled 125 ml glasses (x 4) plate and decided to have a trial while waiting for my family from shopping... Had a starter and really enjoyed it. When my family arrived we all had lunch and really were happy for it. Excellent food, service and selection of beers
5
Nice break from shopping in Somerset. Next to a number of other bars and restaurants. Good for some Japanese snacks and a few beers. They have Sapporro on tap (their cheap housepour) then a great selection of Japanese craft beers. They will give you advice on what may suit your taste buds.
5
Had a really nice cider here on my first night in Singapore. Paws attracted by the convenience of the location and the vibe of the place. My companion had a curry which she rated quite high. I didn't really look at what I ordered and ended up with these whole fishes on sticks. You could see thier little faces through the tempura. They didn't look happy, in fact they looked fairly angry. I ate them anyway.Both my companion and I enjoyed a nice cider. It's a nice spot for taking your ease and people watching. The staff were nice. I recommend it. Maybe skip the poor fishes with the sticks up thier butts though
4
There service was excellent which is rare in Singapore. The beer was tasty and the food was very good and cheap. We both had the lunch special and the sauce on the salad and main was worth coming back for. Great location too with a good atmosphere with a lot of foot traffic
5
I went here every day with my girlfriend during our days spent in Singapore. Great atmosphere, selection of beers and very good quality of food. If you want a break drinking an iced Japanese beer, this is the place!
3
Stopped by one evening, after walking for a bit. Seating is quite limited, and not very ideal on very hot days. Decent selection of Japanese beers and snacks.
5
Nice place to relax to have beer while waiting for your Wife or Girlfriend shopping. Many Japanese craft beers to selection from and little bite to go along with the beers.
4
Extensive array of craft beers paired with yakitori classics. Love the concept. Good sticks overall, but imho I thought the tsukune was average. A fun spot to chill out while the better half shops.
4
Prompt service from the staff. Good selection of Japanese craft beers. Overall, a good place to chill-out for a couple of drinks.
4
Good Yakitori. Good beer. Good service. Good location. Just steps from Somerset MRT. So what is the problem? Menu items are limited. Not enough choices. I would have liked to have some Ochazuke or onigiri to finish off the meal. Hope they will expand their menu with more selections of food
4
Walking down Orchard Road late evening, we came across this a nice small bar tucked away next to 313@Somerset near Orchard Road. Its an outdoor seating bar with low wooden tables & benches. The menu had fairly decent options of Japanese street food & a wide selection of Japanese craft beers.We ordered for some veg tempura, yakitori, curry and rice along with some beers. The food was quick to arrive and was tasty. The staff are friendly and service is reasonably fast. We enjoyed the relaxed atmosphere of the place which had some really good music as well. It is a nice place to visit after a long day at work or after shopping at Orchard Road
3
Stopped in here for a drink and a snack and a bit of people watching while we cooled down. They have a lot of expensive stuff which is nice. But do not get fooled by the Happy Hour sign it does not mean 2 for 1 it only means a modest discount. The Yakatori we ordered was over cooked especially the chicken liver. Paul's Restaurant Rating Rating 1 - 51. Disaster will never go again2. Poor, likely will not eat again3. Average, nothing exceptional4. Good, will come back5. Excellent, love this restaurant. Ambience ⭐️⭐️⭐️Menu Selection ⭐️⭐️⭐️Service ⭐️⭐️⭐️Food Quality ⭐️⭐️⭐️Portion Size ⭐️⭐️⭐️Value for Money ⭐️⭐️Average Rating: 2.8

I and my wife love Japanese food. We found this place after an afternoon walking around Orchard to take photos with Christmas trees. It is amazing. You can find good selection for Japanese craft beers. The staff are friendly and fast service. One lady helped us with nice photo with the warmest smile
4
I havent' found so far any other place in Singapore specialized in Japanese Craft beer.They good a nice selection, some well knows abroad, such as the Hitachino options, and some more local.The food, while not bad, was not that tasty or special. Stick to the beers, those are the main attraction
4
Quite happy with the food and beer. Wasabi tako is appetizing, boneless chicken karaage is not the usual small portion n is well seasoned w a tint of ginger, all the skewered items tried are delicious. Will come again!
5
The highlight is the selection of beers. Will be coming back to try different ones. It might be better to come after 5 as it can get very hot and there's no indoor seating.
1
DO NOT order the beef yakitori - tough and tasteless. The pork katsu curry was basically slopped onto the plate as if the cook couldn't give a hoot. The bill for one beer, two diet cokes, a crap plate of pork katsu curry, two sticks of overcooked beef yakitori and a lame chicken salad came up to about $65. Not worth the beer, food or ambience
5
Great place with a wide variety of Japanese Craft brews that I never had the chance to win experience in my home-country. One beer in particular stood out - the Kagua Rouge. Simply great. The Yakitori was great and so were all of appetizers. Service very nice but a bit spotty. Nice location in 313@Somerset
4
Went there for an after work event drink with about 10 friends. We tried about 20 beers on the menu and most of ten were good. I don't know Japanese craft beers all that well but I do know US craft beers. I have to say that like whiskey the Japanese are coming up with some fine product. I personally liked most the IPA's I tried and for something interesting try the Apple Hop.The food was also well received by the crew I was with. We mostly stuck to yakitori so our point is fairly one sided.If you are looking for some good beer and task snacks give this place a shot.Finally, the service was great, which is often a rarity in Singapore
4
We ordered a few tempura, a few yakitori, 2 set of 8 tasting and a few of hibiki 12 yrs old single malt. Total bill was 611 SGD including GSt and service charge. About 200$ each was not too bad. The services was attentive. The ambiance was nice.
4
I stopped in here for a quick Karaage Chicken curry which consisted of a goodly portion of crispy, well flavoured chicken, rice and decent curry sauce. Staff were super friendly and quickly offered me the wifi password as soon as I got my phone out. When I stopped here I was very tired after long flight, feeling a little less inclined to eat alone in a strange city than normal, and so was being less adventurous than I might generally be, food wise. I was quite comfortable eating here alone, drinking my tap beer and people watching. Can't say fairer for what I needed at the time.
3
I moved from Osaka to Singapore where I got some good exposure to the fast growing craft beer scene. Therefore, I was pleasantly surprised to see a restaurant dedicated to serving Japanese craft beer. I've been there twice now. The selection is OK. I think it's missing some great brewers, but I'm sure that's has more to do with the limitations of who is exporting. The bottle options are much better then the draft options. The food is your standard Japanese Izakaiya fair. I would recommend the Yakitori. Prices are on par for craft beer in Singapore. Minimum $12 for a beer. Unfortunately, I don't think I'll be going out of my way to make future visits. While a cool concept, I think there are better craft beer places in Singapore with a wider selection of better beers
4
Gee! I never realised there were so many different flavours (flavours, not types, or brands) of beer in Japan until I came to JiBiru. Almost (bit not quite) as many as in Belgium! Sometimes they run out of a particular kind, but there are still plenty to choose from. The food is OK, just to keep you from getting tipsy, but we've all had better and more varied Japanese bar food elsewhere (be it yakitori or tempura, etc)
4
We stopped by here later one evening, and enjoyed good food and beer. We had gyoza to start and katsu curry for main. The staff were friendly and amusing and the food was quick to arrive but very tasty. We also tried some Japanese beer and really enjoyed the relaxed atmosphere of the place
5
Located within a nice and shady thoroughfare off Orchard Rd this place has great customer service and a good variety of beers. There's free wifi too, just ask for the password.
5
Good selection of Japanese Craft Beer . Quick response time and a good experience.
It is not a place you go if you are hungry, more like a "beer and snacks" kind of place.
If you like different kind of beer I would definitely recommend!
5
This Japanese bar is a nice break when wandering up and down Orchard Road. Hitachino Nest beers are served together with small and tasty dishes. Highly recommended!
4
We give 4 stars for the great collection of Japanese beers. Cheaper price before 6pm.
We ordered Yakitori, Karaage Curry, Chicken Wings. They all alright, decent enough to accompany great conversation with friends :).
3
Good chill out place with friends. They provide outdoor seating area. Most of them come here for craft beer with small snack. They do provide proper lunch.
4
We tried the rice beer from the tap. It was refreshing and a bit strong at the same time, very nice. We accompanied the beer with tempura (crispy, served with a delicious sweetish sauce) and edamame (fresh and salty). Everything was quite satisfying. One single disappointment. When I asked for the best beer from the tap the waiter suggested the Sapporo, one of the most common canned Japanese beer, even though it is supposed to be a place with special and particular beers.
4
Amidst the busy Orchard Road this bar/restaurant provides a welcome break.They specialise in Japanese food and Japanese craft beers. The selection of beers is impressive, both on tap or bottled.I had two beers, miso soup and pork yakitori for $36, including service an taxes. The food was delicious and the beers nice an cold.Service was prompt, friendly and efficient
3
This was a welcome place to stop amid the frenzy of Orchard Road. It is in the entrance to Somerset MRT and has a sort of indoors/outdoors feel. The menu has a nice selection of Japanese food and a good beer selection including a tasting option. The staff were pleasant enough but despite it being very quiet we struggled several times to gain their attention
3
Been here a few times. Wide range of beers, excellent Japanese range. Food is slightly above average, the payload on is very good though. Service is decent, staff respond quickly and orders are served rapidly. Hospitality is poor though, was refused an order for a 12-3pm lunch set at 2:55pm. If your business is closing, that'd be too bad but understandable.. this is just being crass to earn a quick buck (lunch set is good value) and ensuring a customer won't return again. Worked in this case
1
Next to the adorable looking tables there is a gigantic poster which reads "HAPPY HOUR FROM 6 TO 8". We sat down to enjoy a plate of 12 skewers (which were not bad, but not mouth watering either). I had my 2 "happy hour" half pints and my husband had 2 "happy hour" pints. I specifically asked the waiter if those were happy hour ones and she agreed. When the bill came, it turned out that "happy hour" meant 20% less. Excuse me? Where in the world does that apply? I complained to the waiter and looked without saying a word and went away. Yes, my friends, we paid 99,93 SD . I will never come back and advise you to do the same
4
We found a Japanese craft beer place called Jibiru in 313 Somerset. Japanese food and the beer was very good and very interesting, definitely worth a visit.
4
Good selection of interesting craft beer, matched with a good menu of yakatori and other small portion delicacies. Service is great and reasturant is well worth a visit
3
But food is very average attempt at Yakitori and pretty expensive too. The pork was basically pure fat, the beef well cooked but too much pepper ruined the flavour. Go for the beers only
3
I stumbled across JiBiru while walking through this area and decided to come back for a late dinner and a beer. I'm not sure if they have indoor seating, but I sat outside at low key wood tables with benches.As the name would suggest, the main point of the bar is the wide selection of Japanese craft beer. Whilst they get top marks for diversity, I was a bit disappointed that they were unable to recommend anything beyond "this is what we have on special". I would have hoped for better enthusiasm for the headline attraction!Food was OK: I had a mixed selection of yakitori and a salad. Everything tasted nice, but it didn't blow me away. However, given JiBiru seems to be more of a bar first, restaurant second, this is forgivable.Finally, I was a bit disappointed by the service, as I alluded to above. Based on other TripAdvisor comments, service got good marks, however I found service to be very utilitarian and not overly helpful.Nonetheless, the novelty of JiBiru and the wide selection of beers on offer means that I will be making a return visit at some point
4
Did the beer sampler and enjoyed a couple more of their beers. Good, solid, tasty. It can be tough getting a pkace to sit but dont be shy and join someone at a table if its not full. Had an ap which was good but thats as far as I went with food. The beer is the real attraction here
5
Found by accident and tried before reading reviews the beer (I had the ginger flavoured and the pilsner) was excellent, smooth and flavoursome. Service was good and allowed me to control rather tha hovering. Snacks, skewers were just right.I recommend happy hour fir drinks and people watching.
5
I stopped by here the other day and was really pleasantly surprised.First I got their Japanese draft beer. I am a total beer snob and dont call a beer great unless it really is. This was a great beer. In fact maybe I should go back just for the beer before I leave.Anyway on to the foodThe rice is supposedly brought in from Japan - I dont want to say it was that special, but it was good...maybe even better than normal rice. Maybe it was just really perfectly cooked.I got a greens salad which was nothing special but also not bad.I got some of the premium pork belly and onion sticks. These were crazy good. If you dont like fatty cuts of meat you may not like it as much, but I believe fat adds the flavor, and these fatty pork cuts were bursting with flavor. Highly recommend
4
spent a pleasant hour sampling some of the craft japanese beers on offer. Good choice although many draught beers were unavailable on our visit. Prices will come as a shock to anyone not used to drinking in Singapore especially as prices are shown as net. As previous reviews have mentioned bar staff can seem a little aloof
4
Great range of really good beers makes this one of the best places for a beer in Singapore. Not a fan of orchard rd but we come here for the beer. Food is really good but too small and being Singapore very expensive for what you get. Some of the young male staff need to lose the attitude and take a course in customer service and explain what beers are available before customers order. Despite that we will keep coming time and time again there is always something new to try. The chocolate draft is very special.
5
Jibiru is one of the place that I have to visit in Singapore. Sited in Sommerset shopping center, this place is a heaven for beer connoisseur. You can have local beer and local craft beers of Singapore and wide range of imported beers. One of my favorite is Dead Guy Ale. Yum!! Mercy, the waitress is very friendly and love to chat with customers
