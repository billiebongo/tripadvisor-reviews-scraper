We had a family dinner here and ordered a number of their favorites.The ambiance of the place- is nothing flash. A simple restaurant, packed full of tables/chairs. Parking is at least free!My brother did all the ordering, so we just ate!The Peking Duck was good, as it is their signature dish - although the Lychee wood was lost on me. The fish steamed in claypot, was good, not great. A bit expensive I thought, but I'm told that's the normal price of fish in Singapore (I live overseas now).Homemade bean curd was also quite average. We had a few more dishes, which after just 4 days, I don't remember them at all. Average at best. Completely unmemorable. The dish my brother raves about - is the Rice Vermicelli with pork knuckles. The presentation was interesting, served in massive leaf. Again, it tasted ok, but really nothing very special. I had a piece of the pork, which was without fat, and tasted dry/hard. The place was also really packed, and service slow. Seems under-staffed, as the waitresses kept running around (poor girls). But I had to continuously bring my teapot to the kitchen to be filled, and there were long breaks between dishes. Averaging about $50 per pax, I'd expected better food. It was ok. Definitely can get better value elsewhere

We were in the Upper Bukit Timah area and looking to bring some out of town relatives for a good dinner. I searched online and thought this restaurant with "home" in its name would be a cosy place to savour home style dishes. As it turned out, it was a proper restaurant with a nice setting offering innovative Cantonese style cuisine.This restaurant specialises in duck and a unique steam fish dish. We tried the Roast Duck roasted with Lychee Wood. It was the best I have ever tasted in Singapore. The meat was tender while the skin was crispy. Very good indeed.Next we had the pumpkin puree soup that had lobster and asparagus. Simple with natural flavours. For the next specialty I opted for the Soon Hock steamed in claypot. Again very good. What piqued my interest was that the sauce used is not just soy sauce but infused with lemongrass. So it was really good with a bowl of rice.We also had pork rib with mango sauce which has a subtle taste. Tender and tasty.The broccoli with crabmeat was also different from our past experience in that there was substantially more crab roe that gave it its orange hue.For dessert we had Or Nee or mashed yam paste with pumpkin and gingko nuts, and almond cream. The dessert was ordinary and not as creamy as elsewhere.Overall the meal was very good although the taste may be a tad too bland for some.I spoke to the staff at the end of the meal and she revealed that the chef does not use MSG and avoid excessive seasoning and oil. But the guest could request for stronger flavours in the sauces if desired. The Or Nee was not being not as smooth as it should be was a result of the chef not using oil to smoothen it. So it was a healthier alternative.Our family liked it and will sure be back again soon. We are eyeing the Peking duck next

I visited HOME about a month ago. I had an enjoyable meal with my family. Good food and fast service. The waitresses were friendly and the waiters were absolutely charming. Ambience was cosy. The only flaw was the striking red walls. Would recommend this place to anyone

was truly disappointed with the S$59.80+ ala carte buffet at restaurant home on 25.6.2014. probably had to do with wrong expectations, as the award winning chef tan yong hua has so many accolades, not least the first singaporean chef to win against iron Chef Thailand. also the price of S$59.80+pax would be quite ok if the dishes were good & not just mediocre.#1 the mini buddha-jump-over-the-wall(bjotw) had a light decent soup base (not intense & maybe that was intended), a good flower mushroom, a quite small abalone which was ok & lots of chicken plus a cheap fish maw (not 花胶). i supposed average ingredients were quite ok if the soup was really tasty. it was not a bad soup. 1 of us commented any lie tong (例汤) soup of the day by tunglok or imperial treasure would beat this, so there was nothing much to say.#2 the bite/texture & flavour of the 8-head abalone & also the flower mushroom were quite good. the spinach was just average, and perhaps it was more the method of preparation, but any brown sauce braised chinese abalones (ah yat, tunglok, xin restaurant etc) would be a better overall taste experience than this (not a better abalone). i guess this dish would be above average to good whereas the mini bjotw was just average.#3 the salmon & maguro (tuna) sashimi were ok, the lobster was buried in mayo. a wasabi or salted egg prawn would be better. the dish was ok but nondescript.#4 the prawns were big & fresh & quite tasty. i guess it was about as good as a herbal prawn could be. it was not a dish i would much fancy though, unlike the wow factor with the golden prawns at mikuni.#5 the deep-fried red garoupa was competent, good even. but as 1 diner commented, it was no better than ah yat though the garoupa tasted better than soon hock. i also thought it was not much better than peach garden miramar, not counting ban heng’s deep-fried soon hock which was very average.#6 the roast duck was to me about the best dish for the evening (& it was not among the chef selected dishes above limited to 1 serving). skin was crispy, meat was tender, moist not overcooked & very flavourful.#7 the crabmeat broccoli was another better dish, looked good, tasted great, more like the standards of tunglok or imperial treasure.#8 the sichuan spicy fish fillet (i forgot to take a photo) was ok edible not good but as 水煮鱼 it was a disaster! even the NUS canteen foodgle hub just above average S$6 水煮鱼 was better than this.#9 the sichuan spicy beef with rice crackers was worse than the fish! beef was bad by any standard, the sinewy quite tasteless like rubber type. even the artificial tenderised beef at coffeeshop zi char stalls were better! not sure the thai type rice crackers qualified as 锅巴. if it were any zi char stall, i guess one could argue that’s just a choice of words.#10 the osmanthus jelly was pretty good, i guess not so far off timhowan which was better, but it’s just jelly.#11 the rosella jelly was ok for a jelly but really a poor dessert c/w any of tunglok, xin, imperial treasure, i guess better than having red beans & green beans at ah yat.#12 3 of us ordered the almond jelly (no photos). this was good restaurant standard.i had earlier booked en japanese dining @ alocasia to try their S$56++pax queen crab wagyu ala carte buffet, but had canceled that to try this new restaurant. it was a manifestly wrong decision to take this ala carte buffet. it was not near as good as peach garden miramar’s (S$30.80++pax 3 paying 1 free) which was 1/2 the price. this 4pax dinner cost S$264nett. my recent fabulous 4pax dinner at mikuni cost only S$195nett. there was totally no comparison at all regards the food! :-(1 Facebook friend who dined there recently commented that the ala carte orders – lychee wood smoked peking duck, claypot steamed fish, tofu egg, braised pork knuckles vermicelli in oba leaf – were pretty good. i guess a sound opinion & i am not totally ruling out trying ala carte here if there are takers among my friends(but i think not likely), but the ala carte buffet is totally out for me! & i think really the organisation is still not in groove to put up this below par level of cuisine for a S$59.80 ala carte buffet.

It was a celebration for a friend's 10 yr anniversary triumph against cancer.I chose this restaurant based on the good review in the newspapers & that the owner is a renowned chef.But we were disappointed by the standard of the food.We ordered the restaurant specialty - Peking duck smoked with lychee wood, spinach, fried brown rice. The left over duck meat was stir fried with onion and ginger. The duck was served both ways- with sugar and the standard way with hoisin sauce and the pancakes. The 1st way didn't left much impression on us. The second way was worse as the pancakes was way too thick. The duck skin was crisp but nothing spectacular. The fried brown rice was cooked to a perfection. But we had issue with the low grade of rice used. It was the Thai cargo red rice. The pomelo tea we ordered was actually Korean citron tea- the type you scoop a teaspoon and mixed with hot water. I don't need to be a food connoisseur to know that pomelo is different from citron tea. Before we left, we saw Chef Tan talking to some guests that he knew. If he seriously care about his food and walked over to us, I would have given him my feedback. But none in the restaurant asked for our opinion. We left the restaurant with much disappointment..Many Cantonese restaurants serve better Peking duck than his

Peking duck is a must at this homely restaurant. You know how serious the chef is about his Peking duck when he customises his own oven..which is what Chef Tan Yong Hua does. He is also the chef who regularly appears on television programmes as a judge, and lately, he is also known as the chef who went to Bangkok and beat the Iron Chef Thailand!The Peking duck is classic Beijing style, only with less fats, but served with traditional pancake and condiments.Some other hidden gems are the lesser-seen heritage dishes. One of the signatures is the fish (you get to choose which kind of fish), cooked in claypot in a very interesting, complex sauce made from a mix of lemongrass, blue ginger, spring onion etc. Another must-have is also the lobster noodles.....this chef cooks his Chinese noodles until al dente, and he has really given the usual Chinese noodle dish a luxe (not to mention delicious!) makeover
