This cocktail bar is at the back of the new Intercontinental hotel. Very modern and trendy with lots of great drink choices, particularly cocktails
Serving bar snacks and with excellent customer service
Not cheap but worth a visit

The word awesome is an understatement for this joint, good looking bartenders with great personality and are very well versed with their own products. I must say if you could put a small DJ booth, good DJ spinning deep house this could be the next IN THING in ROBERTSON QUAY. Kudos to the designers
