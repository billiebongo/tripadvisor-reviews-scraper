My all time favourite!!!! I like to compliment staff Chai Ling, she specially asked chef to tailor make a cake for my mumâ€™s 80th birthday. V v impressive, tasty, & value for money. Delivery was very punctual too.

Ordered salted Carmel ice cream today. completely disappointed. Luckily had ordered a single scoop, had to throw it after few spoons, absolutely tasteless.

They have quite a selection of unusual ice cream. You will be spoilt for choice, which is great but was disappointed for the taste. I had the Belgian chocolate and felt that the taste of the chocolate was a bit lacking in richness.

Was looking for dessert in the area & decided to walk in. Looking at the rather small place, we were not expecting much. But when the waffle with ice-cream came, I was delighted that it was good. The ice-cream is handmade (like many places today). The server at the counter was friendly and helpful

We were passing and thought - yes, ice cream. Roadside parking was quite easy - we had coffees and shared two scoops of ice cream. Followed by two more scoops of ice cream. Followed by...!This was a great place. Prices are reasonable. Service was OK. It deserves to be busier to give it more atmosphere. Try it!!

I often visit the outlet at Eastwood. I hv patronized now for few years. Standard is as good as ever. I love the ice cream - all flavours, fresh & really enjoyed them all the time. Our favourite is cuppucino, rum n raisin n coconut. The ice cream cakes are delicious n value for money. Love the promotions esp buy 2 tubs get 1 free. I like to compliment chai ling for being v flexible & spontaneous in replying to my orders for cakes. I will only buy ice cream from Bing Bing! Real best quality!!!

As a chocolate lover, I'm so very dismayed by the poor quality of their chocolate selection. However, the Lychee and Soursop flavours are must trys! Even I cannot resist buying a pint to take home, especially for the former. Especially when they have the buy 2 get 1 free promotion on!My wife absolutely adores the Mao Shan Wang Durian flavour, while it is probably one of the best in Singapore, still will not taste as good as when durians are in season. (For the main ingredient, durian, they probably purchase refrigerated durians that had been stored from the previous harvest months ago).I do have to point out how great the staff are, almost none of the ice cream shops I've visited would give you empty cups and even an ice cream scoop to consume a pint in store (because purchasing single and double scoops would almost definitely provide a better profit margin). Just look at the photos I've uploaded of how nice the staff were

If it is all about the Ice Cream then Bing Bing Ice Cream Gallery is pretty nice, they have some great specials and tasty flavours at reasonable prices... which keeps us going back. If its service, or a friendly smile your after Bing Bing Ice Cream is not the place to go honestly (and its about my fourth visit), I have never known staff to be so miserable serving ice cream, we are lucky if we get a hello

There is just something about this charming little ice cream shop that has us coming back again and again. Plenty of ice cream choices, comfortable seating and atmosphere, and smiling staff behind the counter. We always try a taste of a new flavor but end up choosing among our favorites: cranky caramel crunch or sea salt caramel. Both are amazing. Daily specials also offer additional variety. You'll have fun choosing! Enjoy

I came here with my 3yo daughter after visiting the doctor. The sorbet was quite nice, and the shop was very quiet. I think only one other person came in while we were there. The prices per scoop are also very cheap compared to other ice cream stores
