Just moved to Bishan and found this nice place serving healthy and vegetarian food. Really worth it. Prices are ok and food is delicious. Service is friendly.
Closed till end of May 2017 though so better wait till June to go :)

As the only healthy hawker in Bishan, The Wholefood Kitchen also happens to be amazing. There is a menu with four fillings (lemongrass tofu & cashew, lentil patty, mojo chicken & avocado, and salmon & egg) and four ways to eat them (salad, bagel, wrap & rice). I went once and loved it so much, I've been back many times. I keep ordering the lemongrass tofu & cashew salad because it's so good, and the special patty (chickpea maybe) on onion bagel. I want to try the other items too, but the ones I've gotten are so good that I have a hard time straying. The prices are about $9 per entree. It's $9 well spent- you feel satisfied in a healthy-full way afterward and enjoy every bite! The owner is the only person running the hawker so it is closed Sunday and Monday and after 8:00. I hope that one day she is able to hire employees and stay open more often because living in Bishan, this place is essential.

Healthy and wholesome. You need to try it to believe it. Enjoyed every bite. This is a hidden gem above Bishan Bus Interchange. Lady boss is a nice lady. Tried the 3 boat tacos and lady boss even recommended the order we should have it in. Too bad they arent open on sundays and close by 8 pm on weekdays.

Craving innovative healthy well-priced meals and raw desserts, on a budget? You might enjoy this clean little nook on the second floor of Bishan Cafeteria (after walking up a flight of stairs, turn right and head for it next to the drinks stall) above the bus interchange, which is a pioneering gem in Singapore and a place with food I enjoy. Owner-chef Sanye who runs the stall by herself is earnest and careful about nutrition, puts love into her food, speaks English and Mandarin and dialects, and can explain healthy flexitarian eating to any heartlanders and foreigners who do not understand English but speak Mandarin and/or dialects. Meals are based on a balance of good carbohydrates and plants, with options of adding animal protein. Choose a base (purely salad or brown rice or a bagel or a wrap) which usually comes with extra greens and/or nuts already included in the price, followed by a non-carbohydrate filling which changes from time to time (lemongrass-marinated tofu or sweet potato chickpea patty or smoked salmon or Cuban Mojo chicken), and the total comes to SGD 8 or SGD 9, unless you add extras or up-size. Not needing to pay rent at an air-conditioned space translates into lower expenses for the same good-quality ingredients found at upmarket health cafes, which is reflected in the prices of her food. All sauces and dressings are homemade. Himalayan pink salt is used, and so is liquid aminos, food is preservative-free, and no red meat is used. Her choices and preparations of various vegetables as combinations for salads showcases her thoughtfulness to how they taste together. Being aware of food allergies and/or religious preferences, the regular options on the main menu do not have garlic and onion, and characteristics such as gluten-free (GF) or vegan (V) are clearly indicated. If you are allergic to nuts or have other questions, inform her before ordering, and she will be glad to assist in her suggestions. Similarly, she is friendly and open to feedback about her food. Vegan bi-weekly specials allow her to practise her penchant for balancing experimentation and fusion. The current special (as of 18 October 2016) is Pumpkin Oatmeal pancakes with black sesame ricotta and orange-ginger yoghurt. In case you wonder if these vegan specials can replace or surpass meat in terms of taste, a previous bi-weekly vegan special was jicama and pomelo with Baiye Tofu salad in a konbu ponzu dressing, and this scrumptious item in its final combined form tasted vividly similar to the duck salad at the chinese restaurant Beng Thin Hoon Kee. She sometimes produces vegan baked goodies in the form of muffins and loaves, and her ever-changing selection of raw cakes can be ordered in advance eg lemon pistachio, rosewater strawberry, pina colada. Fruit juices from Frobishers not usually found in hawker centres can be purchased to go with the food here, and there are many surrounding seats available in the communal space of Bishan Cafeteria. Regardless of whether you are vegan or non-vegan and/or you want to try a form of healthy eating which practises fusion and/or you have friends who have different eating preferences or dietary restrictions but everybody wants to have a meal to share which is healthy eating yet different? This is a place worth trying, and learning how interesting healthy eating can be, as I have been experiencing for myself :
