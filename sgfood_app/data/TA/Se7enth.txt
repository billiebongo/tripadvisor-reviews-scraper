Had a nice dinner on Sunday evening. Excellent service, food quality is fabulous and nice ambience. We were served by Regins and Kathi, who are polite and thoughtful. We will want to return for another occasion.

My group of about 24 colleagues ate at this restaurant today. As usual, we are a rowdy crowd and we took a long time to decide what we would like to eat. Mr Kathir was very patient in getting our orders and was extremely attentive to our needs. The food was great, and his service made the dining experience all the more better. Thanks Mr Kathir for your fantastic customer service!

Our lunch at the restaurant was marked with great service and food. The food recommendations by Mastroianni were spot on and we left the place content with the variety of food and flavors to make it a place we will return to in the near future

With deals that they offer, how can one say no to food and service experience in its class? Going at less than $30(TBA) for a 4 course lunch of soup, FREE FLOW salad, mains and dessert or tea/coffee, it is definitely worth the buck for the experience of wonderfully prepared meals and great service. Undeniably a must try from me

A little heads up for this restaurant is to make sure you allow yourself time to get lost especially if you have made a reservation. It wasn't easy to find until we asked a person who was working in the connecting building.Once we reached, there was nobody to show us to our seats sadly although the restaurant was rather empty. We had to wait for about 5 minutes before somebody came up to us. Food was delicious though and served promptly with very friendly service.It would be better if we didn't had any trouble getting their attention, given that only 2 other tables were occupied. I cannot imagine how it'll be if it was crowded.Overall, amazing food and friendly service albeit slow... And the atmosphere was awesome too. A nice quiet place

Was using the entertainer app so it was definitely value for money. However they do have the executive set lunch at $24 per pax with free flow of salad bar/soups, mains and tea/coffee which seems quite good too. We ordered the fish and chips and seafood pasta which was amazing. The mussels were huge and fresh. Dessert was a little disappointing though. Had the chocolate ice cream with berries compote and the berries were really sour.

Was celebrating our boss' birthday with 3 other colleagues. 4 of us ordered fish while my boss had chicken. Those of us that had fish thought it wasn't quite fresh as it emitted a slight fishy smell when it was served at the table, but it was edible. Portions were small. We didn't bring this up to the staff as it was a birthday celebration and we were the ones who suggested the venue. Didn't want to look bad.. My boss said the chicken was good though. The soup and salad spread was average when compared to other restaurants in the vicinity. May go back to try the ala carte menu.

They advertised for a lunch set meal on 5th Oct - Thursday which they no longer honoured on 9th Oct- Monday. 3 course meal which had a salad bar which looked like a canteen and coffee from a nepresso capsule at 24 ++ is a rip off
