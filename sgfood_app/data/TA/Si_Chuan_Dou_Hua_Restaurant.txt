The food is quality is very good. It has a nice relaxed atmosphere. And the service staff are friendly too.

Although the food was good, it wasn't exceptional. The price is high though, and nothing justifies it. However the service is good.

The service is excellent and the Chef is very talented. My family enjoyed it very much. Keep up the good job!!!

It was almost closing time when I entered, but the staff were polite and suggested me some of their regular menu and it was served quite fast.

Celebrated my parents wedding anniversary with the family. The items on the menu are slightly on the high side but the food and service is good!
Our favorite dish has to be the Peking duck. The dim sum here is pretty good too.

My wife and I are in Singapore for the past week and we had dinner here on 4 occasions so far. We repeated our visits so often in such a short time because we are happy with the food, service and value for money. What is more, Yenny could provide us a table in a trice despite the crowded evenings with many patrons already celebrating the Chinese New Year. Pangwei took time to explain all ingredients in each dish due to our dietary preferences. We got fresh seafood cooked to our choice and taste. We intend visiting again before we leave Singapore later in February
5
Thanks to the staff (Wing, Pangwei, May, Yenny & Emily) who provided top notch service! They were polite, courteous, willing to answer our questions and gave really good recommendations. Our second time at the restaurant and still find the food yummy with excellent variety and value for money. Will come back again

We brought our Japanese friends to savor Szechuan cuisine. Main also the tea pouring skill using long spout.Decided to try the a la carte buffet of 60 dishes. We only managed to try all their popular dishes. The szechuan cuisine is a bit too spicy for our guest even though we tell them to lower the spicy level. There are 4 dishes we can only order once. Overall food is up to par. Serving is big for 6 pax. So much so, we told them to cook for 4 pax, as we only want to try varieties.Service is prompt the staff are rather attentive. (Maybe there are only a few tables full, as the restaurant is rather empty).As for the tea, there were already tea leaf in the cups when we arrived. It's green tea. The tea is rather bland. It's very different from the roasted Japanese Green tea I used to drink.The restaurant is on the 3rd level of Park Royal Kitchener Road, just opposite Farrer Park MRT. Very accessible
5
The food here was super good, the best my family and I had in a while! Both servers May Ng and Pang Wei were very professional and patient with all our requests. Our favourite dishes were the some kind of truffle pasta dish (very unique and delectable), double boiled chicken and crab claw soup, peking duck and tofu with douhua. This is a place I will definitely come back to.

Dinner for my parents 40th wedding anniversary. One of the best si chuan cuisine we ever have. Specially enjoy the Peking duck. The service is excellent. Thank you Wing and May for the wonderful evening.

Had a scrumptious dinner at Si Chuan Dou Hua at Kitchener Road. Ordered Suckling pig, Mushroom Wasabi, Tofu, Kailan with salted vegetable and Glutinous Greentea balls with salted eggyolk. Service was efficient. An enjoyable get together.

We had recently held our wedding solemnisation cum dinner at this venue. We were impressed by the fast response and excellent service provided by the restaurant team with special mention of one of their staff, Pang Wei who was attentive and patient with our changing demands. Our guests were able to dine comfortably even though our 6 tables wedding dinner were served in open area. Food is valued for money and tasty and the location is accessible. Thank u for making our BIG day a memorable one.

This is my first visit to the Kitchener road outlet. I enjoy their dim sum at UOB plaza, I find this buffet dim sum spread decent, but quality for certain dish is below par.After the last order (around 12:45pm, one hour after we are seated), a male staff passed us the bill, he was impatient with my questions. He explained that we should leave by 1pm. While waiting for my credit card slip, he came back to clear the table and told us it s a busy day and they need to be ready for the next round of customers. Well, it took him about 3 minutes to clear my table of 4 diners. And making a customer feels unwelcome? He accomplished it within 30sec

I has wanted to book the Beach Road branch of Sichuan Dou Hua but since its under renovation, i ended up booking the Kitchener Road branch instead. After seeing rave reviews of its sichuan food and especially the famous bean curd dessert, i was looking forward to the meal.My husband and I arrived on a Sat evening for dinner at 7pm. The restaurant was not at its full capacity then, but it was probably due to a few big tables that the waiters appeared to be very hassled and busy and we were being ignored for a while until someone eventually came to lead us to a table. It took a while to get someone's attention to order the food and to be honest, the waiters were not as professional as one would expect from a hotel's restaurant.My husband and I ordered the La Zi Ji (spicy fried chicken), Shui Zu Yu (spicy fish in soup), Mala Dou Fu (mala toufu) and wasabi mushroom. The chicken and fish were pretty good, but the mala tofu was lacklustre in terms of both taste and spice level. The wasabi mushroom was worse, barely a hint of wasabi was detected and the dish was further spoiled by an unappetising hue of apple green paste and diced fruits.That aside, we had to order the famous beancurd dessert with wolfberries as everyone waxed lyrical about it. Unfortunately, the beancurd was neither soft as silk nor sweet as claimed. In fact, it had a sourish tinge to it and the texture was weird- slightly rubbery and not smooth as silk.For the price you pay, i would rather spend a bit more and head to Shisen Hanten where you get impeccable service and better food
4
Szechuan classics like 'saliva chicken' and 'water boiled fish' were done well and the daily soup was surprisingly good (passable as Cantonese double boiled). Wide selections of dishes, note portions are large. Ordered medium size for all dishes (party of 6) and that was too much
4
Had a great dinner, food is delicious, the noodles are divine! They are on a bit on the salty side, was thirsty after meal, not MSG thirsty, more of a salty thirsty. Customer service from Wing Toh/SCDH team is simply attentive and friendly. Bless all of you and we will definitely be back here again and again
5
Excellent service and food with good vegetarian options! Many compliments to the team of waiters and waitresses (eg. Pang Wei) who provided excellent service.

Had a pleasant Set lunch at SiChuan DouHua at Park Royal Kitchener Rd, very quiet and serence environment with delicious and fresh set lunch for family of four...
3
The food was average only for the price we paid. The ambient was okay, there is a partition between our table and the next table so have some privacy to ourselves. The service was not so good and one of the waitress was quite rude.
5
Celebrated 80th Bday party with extended family of ~48pax in May'17. Food was Good, Ambience was Excellent, Service was tip-top under the supervision of Restaurant Manger (Ms. Wing TEO). Everybody enjoyed the occasion. Kudos to Wing & Team...

We booked a private room for 20pax for a family member's birthday. We order the 北京鸭. It's not as nice, crispy as Imperial Peaking Duck Restaurant. However, the rest of the food is good. Serving is huge, we could hardly finished, but to pack the balance. The food is not too salty. Though it is a Si Chuan restaurant, they do serve non spicy food, as we have children & adults who cannot take chili. The price after discount is cheap. There is a 30% discount for using UOB Infinity Card, which comes up to $700+ for the whole course of 8 dishes + 2 desserts. We had Peaking duck, scallop w celery, roasted pork, oat prawns, toufu, claypot fish (beware, quite a lot of small bones), sea cucumber w mushroom, noodles. For dessert,

Revisited the restaurant on a packed Saturday night with full house booking, glad that we made a reservation few days earlier. Quality of Food & Service seldom fail under the tight management of Restaurant Manager (Ms. Wing TEO). The restaurant's aircon system continue to disappoint despite repeated feedback, all 6 of us were sweating throughout the dinner especially with a packed crowd tonight. I urge the restaurant to work out alternative solutions quickly before it impacts the business. Pleasant dining experience is important to encourage repeat patrons...
5
Surprise surprise, they actually have a vegetarian menu here. Food is nice and I heard is the best among the different outlets. Wasabi fried mushrooms is highly recommended here. Service wise is prompt and courteous. Will come back here again. Thanks Pang Wei and others for serving us. :

I had a business lunch at the Si Chuan Dou Hua Restaurant at the Parkroyal on Kitchener Road yesterday. The restaurant serves authentic Sichuan and Cantonese food. We had Kampong Chicken herbal soup, Peking Duck, Sautéed vegetable in oyster sauce, braised Seafood noodles and a mixed dessert platter of fruits and Guilinggao. The food was excellent and the restaurant is well appointed restaurant. Staff were attentive but unobtrusive, leaving us to comfortably talk business. ideal location for a family gathering or business lunch. Suggest you make reservations to be on the safe side

Had several delicious dim sum lunch a few years ago so I decided to bring my family to enjoy the ala carte buffet dinner this time. Menu was disappointing, food standards so so, quite a few misses. Food were either too salty, too bland, or too oily, and several dishes came in the same style of chilli oil cooking and tasted simular. 7 pax amounted to almost $390 sgd after a 3 free 1 discount, $55 per pax. Felt that i can go other restaurant for way better food for this price. Also, location was right next to Mustafa and it was a horrible experience entering and exiting the car park as it was chock full of people loitering on the roads and blocking the traffic in the narrow one way lane.

The parking is easy and convenience, decoration is humonious, ambience is quite and elegant with claim and soft Chinese music, tables are well spread out. Service is attentive and professional. Food is authentic and delicious and reasonably fast. We enjoyed their 60 dishes buffet where you could order any dishes from the menu a la minute, at $43++ per head, you must have minimum 4 persons to enjoy this offer. On top of that UOB credit cards get an additional 10% discount. Six of us had 6 dishes, plus noodles, soup and dessert for $48 per head net. It is real great value for money. Just beware that Chinese tea is $5 per cup

Servers were very attentive. The food was authentic and delicious, particularly the pork with Chilli oil as well as the vermicelli with crab meat and egg white. Recommended.
4
Excellent service ！Dim Sum was good but the vinegared pork trotters was disappointing as the taste was not strong。Either overnight and mixed with water。And not much meat，all fats。
3
The food is ok duration of the serving of the food is quite slow as when we were there , there is not much customers . Food portion also quite a lot . But as for the desserts corner refill very slow .
5
We went for the set lunch promotion. Food was great and delicious. The xiao long bao was awesome. Overall is good.
3
Pretty good décor. The food is pretty good, but one full notch below the branch at OUB Centre. Friendly service, even if not terribly pro-active.
5
The day I went for a lunch with my family, the Chef seems to be on a good mood. I think his name is Alvin, he started walking around surveying the quality of the food and gave us recommendations too! Really nice! Very happy that F&B establishments like this constantly gather feedbacks to improve on their food taste. Other than the meat I loved the wasabi fusion dish
4
Always have enjoyed having a meal at Si Chua Dou Hua. Despite my first visit to this outlet as I usually go to the one at Beach Road, the quality is maintained. Also the efficient service provided by the staff make it more wonderful. Do try the signature dish, Dong Po Rou in Pumpkin
4
Overall the experience is good. Restaurant is not too crowded during lunch time. Food may take around 15mins to serve but you can help yourself to some of the desserts that are available.There is one guy who will top up your hot water for your tea via a long neck metal flash which is pretty cool.Do collect your free parking coupon if you are driving there.

We had the set for 10 persons and topped up for 2 more soup and dessert for our table of 12. Birthday buns came on a dish decorated with ginger and strawberries. Soup was double boiled chicken with sea cucumber which we found too salty. Great suckling pig which you eat the skin with flour pancakes, cucumber and spring onion. They try the pork remnants crispy as a second dish and combine pork with noodles pink and white as a 3 rd dish. Noodles was a bit bland but crispy pork was delicious. Also delicious was the salted egg fried prawns and the tofu dish. Tea is poured with great skill from a Long spout Teapot. Would definitely return for the food value. Parking exit was hard as the machine did not accept the cashcard after inserting the complimentary coupon. Warning: as this location is in Little India, expect crowds on a Sunday along Serangoon road and when you exit from the car park which is located next to Mustaf

Best: Boiled sliced fish in Sichuan pepper sauce. Dim sum was served warm and good surprise to see Beancurd for desserts. The staff were friendly and prompt in their services. Did not take too many photos as busy eating. About $39 per pax for 5 pax as we had 1-for-1 and spilt the cost. Starts from 1.30pm.

This monday, I go to si chuan dou hua restaurant with my friends,the food is very good especially the si chuan food,and the soup,we have a good time at this restaurant.

We had enjoyed the sister restaurant at Parkroyal Hotel at Beach Road and so decided to visit this branch at Kitchener Road. Food was similar. I particularly liked the oriental fried rice and the pork ribs that was served with vegetable buns. However, the ambience was no where compared to Beach Road. Service was also slow.
4
This is your non traditional dim sum. The double boil cartilage soup was good. Roast meat is limited to one serving just like the soup. Would highly recommend hakka steamed dumpling, fried char siew bun with taro, chicken feet, prawn dumpling, stir fried long bean and xiao long bao. Remember to order the pig trotter vinegar with quail eggs and baby abalone siew mai. Though we went for 2 pax $50 promotion, there's additional $5/pax for pickles & tea. Same charges applicable for kids. Total price for 5 adults 1 kid is $211

We had staff lunch together. The anchovies corn egg drop soup was solid, delicious and served hot. We also hadBraised Doufu, jelly n roasted duck, chicken with Kong Pao Chilli, vegetables, fried rice n desserts. Just enough for a light lunch. Nice to try. Place was quiet, strains of Chinese oldies played in the background
5
Been here many times, the food is fabulous. Must eat the suckling pig, pre order, same day possible. Other food you should try is their claypot rice, dong po meat in pumpkin. Claypot sliced fish. The fish are expensive, those live ones. Taking a taxi after dinner can be bad, uber or grab taxi would be good.

I took up the 2 for $50 dim sum buffet offer offered by the restaurant. Did not have high expectations but was surprised by the quality of dim sum and of coz their signature beancurd! The dim sum tasted quite good too!! Definitely value for money
4
I was searching for good Dim Sum, and I chanced upon the 2 for $50 nett deal offered by Si Chuan Dou Hua Restaurant. However, there is a minimum of 4 pax to enjoy this offer. As I had read good reviews about the restaurant, I went ahead with just 3 persons, paying for 4.There was a total of about 40 types of food to choose from, dim sum and little dishes. The waitress gave us several recommendations and most of them tasted delicious. There was also a variety of desserts available. We have yet to finish trying all on the menu and would love to go back again. However, I hope that the restaurant could remove the restriction of a minimum of 4 pax to enjoy this buffet

Have not visited this outlet for about a year and forgotten the taste of all the food there.It was really a good impromptu decision that we made although we had the initial fear of expecting a large crowd and service could be lacking due to it being a Sunday lunch.. All fears were dispelled upon arrival and we were able to eat in comfort without having any large crowd or waiting time.Firstly, noticed the Menu has changed a little with several new dishes being offered. Captain Ms Wing is ever courteous and helpful with her knowlegable recommendations and one is able to taste Chef Leung's passion in his cooking. Several dishes with egg white and beancurd in it which makes a light and refreshing change. A must try for all 1st timer. Wowww, I do love the claypot rice which took slightly over half an hour to be ready. Please place order for that item first if one is keen to have a taste of that. A small pot is enough for 3-4 person if having other dishes.Needless to mention, the steamed dim sum and desserts are highly recommended. Not those typical Cantonese ones you get but it has interesting Hakka style ones as well.Special Tea is a must for those tea lovers. Service staff are always polite and friendly. Cosy private set up in the restaurant. Easy,ample parking lots for all motorists and complimentary 3 hours parking given for diners

I feel compelled to leave a review here on trip advisor after having one the singularly worst restaurant experiences ever. Our starter the dim sum was very passable, however we waited for 15 minutes for our Singapore slingsâ€¦Our main course which we decided to share arrived 20 minutes later , however it was preceded a minute earlier by what can only be described as the rice volcanoes in hell erupting through the bowels of Singapore! It arrived on our table with its awful stench, the lovely waitress explained that she needed to apply some soy sauce to loosen the crispy rice, !!!!! The laval rice flow had hardened to a black crust at the bottom of the steaming dish tarnishing everything including the gristled bones formally described as succulent ribs with its sooty sulphurous twang. I payed and left, the manager nowhere to be seen

An authentic Chinese restaurant hidden in a modern hotel located in a cultural district of Singapore. This Chinese restaurant is a great choice for locals and tourists who enjoy good food and oriental ambience. Personally, I enjoyed the Dim Sum there. They have a good selection of both traditional and innovative dim sum and the quality is definitely value for money. Items like yam bun with salted egg filling and roast pork are some of the items to try for. If you like, you can also get their friendly staff to offer recommendations. Oh! And they serve very good quality Chinese tea too
5
The sichuan food cuisine served here is just excellent, the DAN DAN noodles is nice. Do try the prawns in cashew dish, its just awesome. The portions are large and one is enough for 2 people.

Finally I managed to successfully reserve a table for the weekend dim sum buffet at this restaurant! There is a promotion for UOB cards one dines free with 3 paying adults. I went with my parents and 2 aunts and we only paid $208 (5 adults). Our tea was served by a Sze chuan gongfu tea master holding a metallic tea pot with a long spout and the hot water practically flushed our green tea leaves around our teacups in a spectacular whirl. The best dishes were the shrimp dumpling with chives and siew mai with baby abalone. They used fresh shrimp meat with tender, minced pork and made sure that there were 5 pieces (one per person), which was thoughtful (because our table had 5 people). We also liked the preserved mustard green steamed buns (梅菜包) The other savoury dishes were quite tasty too. The service staff were friendly and prompt. Our meal ended on a sweet note with osmanthus cake and almond jelly with pumpkin sauce. Considering that we ordered about 30 different dishes in total, it was a good bargain and the standard is not too far from Fairmont Hotel's Szechuan Court or Marriott Hotel's Wan Hao restaurant (both of which served dim sum buffets).
5
We were blown away by the good service when we first visited the restaurant as unassuming customers. We were considering having our wedding there and was impressed that the service staff all knew about the protocols for weddings and could brief us adequately about the wedding package and services even though their restaurant manager was away. They also mentioned that they have done many weddings at the venue. We were impressed because that meant that they would know what to do at a wedding, and won't be like some helpless part-timers waiting for their managers to give instructions. We were also very impressed with their food. They even gave us complimentary dou hua (beancurds) as part of our dinner. We held our wedding there and was equally impressed with their service on the actual day. They set up the rooms beforehand and the manager even took a photo to ask me if the arrangement was okay! I am very impressed with their service quality and would highly recommend them
4
Just what I was looking for! And the little touches made a huge difference, like the pouring of the tea! Very charming place and the food was very tasty!
5
Went there a few times with friends, the food is delicious and the staffs are all very friendly, and provided good service too. ElLyn, the restaurant manager always recommend me the best dishes in the restaurant, and the staffs, wing, pangwei, yenny, may and jack, all very friendly and give professional service. Definitely will go there many times more and will recommend to more people too
5
We had an excellent 8 course Chinese meal which was quite spicy as this restaurant specialises in Sichuan food. Service was excellent, the staff were very attentive. I will definitely come back for more good food

The food is simply delicious. The ambience is especially quiet during Sunday, which is a great thing for me and my friends cause what's better than spending a quiet Sunday eating Dim Sum for lunch and catching up on the days past. I will just talk about 2 of my favourites here. The Osmanthus & Wolfberry Cake is simply the best I can find in Singapore (yes, even better than Tim Ho Wan). I have tried a few in Singapore and most of them tasted really artificial. But the ones here is really aromatic, and when I put the cake into my mouth, the Osmanthus fragrance simply fills up the space inside and flows out through my nose. Best! As for my review title, the world tiniest abalone is really cute, you can see it and taste it when you order a "long' of Siew Mai. It sits peacefully on top of Siew Mai mountain waiting to jump into your mouth. Definitely worth going when you fill like having good chinese food and dim sum
5
Went there with friends on a week night.The Captain (she said her name is Win) recommended a six or seven dishes including, shark cartilage soup, prawns fried with a variety of puffed rice, almonds slices, dried prawns, etc, and a dish of about 10 different vegetable in a pumpkin. These 3 dishes were memorable. Although the restaurant was reasonably well patronised and all the private rooms taken it was quiet,and the staff went about their service quietly, discreetly and efficiently. My friends all wanted to come back to this place - another day, another time soon.
3
Had dinner with 2 other friends last nite.Food is good but nothing to rave about, in fact a bid disappointed with the Pork dish. The steam "Soon Hock" was fresh and good. Service was good, there were only 5 tables seated that evening.OK for a meal and for entertaining business guest but for personal dining there are better choices for a better price
4
The thought of a decent nice Chinese restaurant situated in Little India will not likely come up in many people mind initially, but after being a loyal customer for the past 4 years, i think this restaurant deserve a little review from me.excellent service - personal yet non-intrusive. Serves excellent sichuan cuisines such as spicy chicken in dried chilli, stewed pork in pumpkin (my boy's fav), stirred fried scallop with chilli etc. Finish the meal off with a home made Soy Bean Curd.use your UOB cc for 15% discount on weekdays. Enjoy complimentary car parking too. What's more can you ask for?
