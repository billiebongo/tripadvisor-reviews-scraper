This restaurant is rather average. Portion sizes were large, however, it is overpriced for the quality and service could be described as brusque. Turnover is highest priority. Would not recommend.
4
Good selection of food and not only seafood. Crowded, typical, lots of atmosphere. The dishes are very tasty.

We were visiting Chinatown and as it was lunchtime we looked for a place to eat and chose Chinatown Seafood Restaurant. We were quickly seated and our order taken. We ordered Chicken Satay and Steamed Pork Buns both which came in good time and were very nice. We found that this restaurant was a good place to have an inexpensive lunch
3
We had visited Chinatown Heritage Centre, and this restaurant is just opposite. At 11 30am the restaurant was not busy and we were given a table close to the street. We ordered two soft drinks and two plates of dim sum. Both arrived fairly quickly and were perfectly fine, if nothing special.By the time we had finished our lunch the restaurant was much busier and the serving staff were kept busy, so we had to wait longer than we would have wished for our bill which came to around S$30 for two.Clean and Convenient, but if we had taken more time to explore, we could have found a hawker court where the choice of food would have been more interesting and better value
5
We ate here last time we visited Singapore and without hesitation we made a stop here for a couple of cold Tigers and a meal. The large bottles of Tiger are a bargain given the location of this restaurant and its an ideal place to sit and people watch, not forgetting to enjoy a good meal. The level of service is good and the toilets must be the cleanest in Singapore which reflects on the overall cleanliness of this establishment. Give it a try
3
The food is average but you expect this when staff are trying to fill all tables with as many people as possible. Service is affected by the amount of people it needs to serve. Food portions are very large and they push the bigger bottles of beer due to price
2
We ate here tonight and ordered Tiger beers from the menu. The only price showing was 5.90SD. We didn’t think to check the size, so when 3 big beers arrived we were quite happy. Then when the bill arrived we’d been charged 7.95SG each. We checked the menu, and there was no price for large beer, it said ‘prevailing price’, whatever that means. We were really annoyed as it was clearly a deliberate deception. We argued the toss, saying we hadn’t been asked which we wanted but the young Chinese guy got really aggressive so we paid up and left. A shame, it spoiled a nice evening, plenty of other places to go to. The food was OK but one dish we’d given up on arrived so long after everything else we’d finished
5
We had gone round Chinatown and we craved for good noodle soup. Luckily it was close to the MRT station on our way home. It was pretty full and the set up make it airy. They have large menus so it helps if you have a general idea of what you want others you'll order too much lol!So we ordered the Tom Yam seafood noodle soup each with chicken satay. We were tempted to order the prawns too but I'm glad we didn't because we had to take away the satay.The soup was so refreshing and flavourful and noodles delicious and prawns, fish, mushrooms...and the perfect amount of chilli. I'd recommend this dish.We drugged yourself to the MRT before collapsing in our hotel room for a nap.
1
This place is crap!!! After we sat down they told us off in a very bad tone that if we are not eating but just have a drink we can’t take their table have to go elsewhere!! What sort of attitude is this!!! Money generated business only obviously!
5
Really great experience. We ordered so much as we couldn't decide what to choose and the poor lady was looking so insecure at us, but we managed to eat everything :) Seriously, the service was great, food was so tasty and amazing, this is a place to pop in. We were just walking in Chinatown and around dinner time we were looking for a place to catch our eye. I don't regret at all, the best choice. We try many restaurants everywhere, from top-middle-low costs because we like food and trying new places, so this was one of the easy places we enjoyed most in Singapore.Just go for it
4
Very busy here in the evening, good food, but not very warm. Great for people watching, wide selection of Chinese food.
4
The ginger and brown sugar tea is powerful magic. I'd come back just for this brew. Very quick service, catering for the westies. Big place, easy to get a seat
5
Big beautiful red chilli crabs, buckets of ice cold tiger beer! Friendly, quick service! What more can u ask for??? An amazing time sharing with friends and family! And very inexpensive! Just brilliant!!!
4
This place knows how to look after groups. Orders are taken efficiently, suggestions made, and you are able to have separate bills.
The food is awesome for sharing, but you don’t have to ..... Tiger beer, nice and cold and cheap.
4
As a Singapore tourist China Town is a must do. Perhaps the most difficult to decide when visiting is where to eat as the choice is overwhelming. As of course we weren’t able to try them all but had a real nice experience visiting Chinatown seafood.
1
Beware of this place. Generally unfriendly staff that display an unbecoming attitude towards customers, regardless whether tourists or locals. Suggest you do your research first. There are tons of alternatives that serve the same food quality at half their price. What a shame to have such a crappy place at this great location.
2
We visited for a drink while in Chinatown in Singapore. I can’t comment on the quality of the food. The service in this place was very abrupt. Not at all like anywhere else we have visited in Singapore, where the service has been excellent. We sat inside the restaurant and were given our bill before asking for it, as if they wanted us to leave. At the time we were going to stay for some more drinks. We wouldn’t return
5
Having been to Chinatown a few years back we wanted to try another restaurant and chose this one, basically because it started to rain and we needed cover! So glad we did. Chose 4 items from the menu which were all delicious and freshly prepared. I liked the fact that the dishes didn’t all turn up at once so you had a chance to pace yourself. Usually after a meal we decide which was our favourite dish, but this time we couldn’t decide as they were all excellent. A few days later on the MRT we debated on where to have lunch and found ourselves heading back to the restaurant and got the same great standard of food. Both times the service was prompt. It’s not a place to have long conversations with the staff......come here for the food!
1
We ate there today for dinner and it was highly unsatisfactory. They included beer on our bill which we did not order. Maybe an honest mistake but the next table beside us also got extra chicken in their bill which they did not ordered. Recommended to double check the receipt!!! The XLB is cold and not fresh. Not really a good place to go as a tourist.
1
We arrived at the restaurant and could not get anyone to even say hello, let alone help us get a seat, in the end we just sat at a empty table and then got a shouted at for sitting down, the lady that served us was rude and wanted us to order immediately so she could go. Ended up arguing with the lady whilst attempting to choose my crab and after all that not sure if we ended up getting the one we choose as the crab flesh was rock hard when they bought it out and cold as well. Stay clear if you ca
5
Great location, price as all the turistic places but with a great taste and quality. Beer tiger 600ml 7sgd....
I travel a lot and can say this is one of the places to visit averytime you visit Chinatown .
1
The staff was very unfriendly and you dont feel very welcome. Beer is pretty cheap, but thats the only good reason to go to this place..
4
Nice location to sit down and enjoy a beer. The menu has familiar chinese menu items, but we just sat down for some quick eats and a few beers. They had a great beer selection with quite a few local craft brews.
2
Location is handy and food is decent, fresh seafood many options. Service was very rude and rushed, didn't feel welcomed.
5
We visit Chinatown Seafood for a meal (or 2)every visit to Singapore and we tell anyone who is visiting Singapore to eat here! The Singapore Chilli Crab was fantastic as always. We also ate Beef Ho Fun and Chicken Satay sticks. The beer is always cold and the service is always friendly. See you next visit to Singapore
4
Yes it does more than just seafood, vegetarian and meat dishes too. We were a tiny bit sceptical about it but thought let's just give it a go, yes it is busy and the service is not so much rushed as it's a very busy restaurant with an equally busy location, so the staff are juggling many different things at the same time. However you will not be dissapointed with the food, all five of my party were suitably impressed with everything we had. If you are unsure then rest assured the food is great
1
We like the food here but the service is terrible. I really wonder if the service crew are trained properly. We are paying for food and can expect some standard of service. We have been here a few times and witnessed bad service but today we were on the receiving end of it. We like the food but please do better with the service. Today we left and had steamed fish elsewhere
2
Never got the chance to try their food. The lady that was trying to get people into the restaurant showed us to a table in the corner. Was shown the menu and drink menu. I noticed that the beer on tap was craft beer which I was not familiar with. I asked the lady if she could help me as I only knew the bottled beer-- Tiger, Heineken etc.She just was not interested in helping so I said to my wife ' lets go '. With that she said ' Yes you go ' and snatched the menus out of my hand and walked away. It was all a little embarrassing really. The only aggressive and rude person we met in Singapore
5
This was a great place to eat, right in the very heart of Chinatown with a constant hub hub of activity streaming by. I was sceptical that the place looked a little like a fast food café but glad to report that the food was first class, beautifully cooked and the waitresses were topping up your drinks for you as they passed. Very reasonable on price, the quality of the food far outstrips the size of the bill in my experience
4
A few reviews said this was a tourist trap - that suggests somewhere that provides poor food or value for tourists. I would say this provides good food at reasonable prices and is a good place to cut your teeth on before going to somewhere more intimidating. We ate here twice - particularly good were the Singapore noodles and the sweet and sour prawns. It was busy but service was good and the food hot and freshly prepared
4
Could do with a cleaner environment but food w yummy. We ordered chicken rice, chili crab, spicy clams, crab fried rice, seafood laksa and satay chicken sticks all which was delicious and flavorful
4
The restaurant is very crowded due to fact that it is located directly in Chinatown. But the food is good even it’s quite expensive. I can recommend it
3
They recently expanded to 2 sides of the road. Large menu that includes the famous chilli or pepper crab. Ask for estimated price before committing as they go by weight, so you won't shocked by the price
4
This was my first dinner in Singapore, and I was not disappointed. I love spicy food, so I got the Szechuan deep-fried chicken, and it was excellent. On top of that, the price was quite reasonable, and the service was quick.
1
Me and my partner ordered Xiao long bao and dumplings in chilli oil for our light meal for the night seeing as we weren't that hungry. There seams to be two types of waiters, one who does drinks and the other that does food. We ordered our drinks and the lady hurrily rushed off before we could ask to order our food. Sitting there 8 mins later when my drink came they realised that we haven't ordered and put our order through. Xiao long bao was terrible, the bao breaks and soup inside just falls out, The meat inside was very bland and had no flavour and also it was so flimsy that the meat just popped out as we picked it up. The dumpling in chili oil did not look the photo nor did it have much chili oil in it. We had to ask for more chili oil as well as soy sauce seeing we had nothing on the table. All in all the seafood maybe good here but stay away from dumplings and its terrible service
4
This restaurant is perfectly located taking up two corners in the heart of china town. The prefect place to have a cold beer while it rain and the perfect place for the world famous Singapore Crab. The Singapore Crab was $68 sgd for 1 kilo and with about 12 of the little bread rolls it was perfect for two people who are big eaters. More sweet than spicy this was a great experience and one that should not be missed. relax, take your time, put on the bib and get to cracking
3
Very busy but table cleared quickly for us to sit with no waiting time. Order was taken quickly but food was slow to come out and not all food served together. Mid range pricing (for restaurant style) with ordinary size serves. Busy, loud, uncomfortable seats but okay for a quick lunch stop. Beer was ice cold which was a bonu
5
Visited this very popular restaurant, also known as Ba Dao Guan, twice in the last week. Enjoyed the food very much. The Veggies Fried Noodles, Schezwan Beans, Gong Bao Chicken and Pork Dumplings were very delicious and all of them had a lot of zing.The service is quite decent and the restaurant is very popular, specially amongst tourists. Prices are very reasonable. Nice place to go to when one is hungry and wants delicious food with value for money
5
Get out of the Clark Quay over-priced nonsense and head to Chinatown for authentic food that tastes great and is more reasonably priced. The atmosphere is crazy and fun and the beer is 1/2 cost of other parts of town. Enjoy!!! Best place we ate in all of Singapore
3
Having been tramping through the sights of Chinatown with a visitor I was delighted to find this roadside cafeteria. Selling hawker style foods - settled for fried wanton and ice cacha for dessert !! Great choice - upped my energy levels. Amused to see a sign "No PDA" - haha - I must be in Singapore - no public displays of affection. So if you get the urge, restrain yourself. No asking the waitress for a quickly - cos that will land you in trouble for outrage of modesty. No PDA - are we really in the 21st century?Foods good - but behave!! No smoking , no outside food - of course, understood.
4
I went here for dinner. With respect to other restaurants in the Chinatown area, this one was pretty good, waiters were fast and of course, prices were really low. They also accepted credit card payment. In the overall my experience was positive!!
4
Our first meal in Singapore had to be a Vermicella and it exceeded our expectations. Very high quality and a very large portion. Alcohol is expensive though and the service charge/tax was very high in comparison to other restaurants nearby.
4
Stopped by here for a feed of Dim Sum - prices were good - beer prices reasonable too. Food cooked fresh to order and delivered hot to table. Seems popular with the locals and that's always a good sign
5
Went here with family members and absolutely loved it. Decent prices, large portions, and succulent seafood. It has everything you could ever want from a seafood restaurant, plenty of choice for even the fussiest of seafood eaters. All that while soaking up the bustling atmosphere of Singaporeâ€™s own Chinatown. I highly recommend this place! :
3
I really like this place for the vibe, its very basic sitting outside seating with plastic chairs. Food is OK, not good or bad. The staff are pretty rude to be honest, pushy with up selling. One of the waiters left our beer bottles on the bottle which asked to remove as they were empty she was very angry and put them on the floor next to me instead, think they wanted them as some kind of tiger advertisement. I would go for the atmosphere but don't expect more than that
3
We arrived at 5.30pm today 2/12 and can easily get a table. We ordered 2 pieces of Chili Crab, sambal kangkung and salted egg prawn.The cilli crab came - the chilli crab sauce was just warm and not hot but the crab was steaming. Somehow the chili crab sauce was missing the oomph. We had ordered the fried bun (man tau) but it came again slightly warm (which seems to indicate that it was pre cooked earlier). The crab was ok but without the right chili sauce the taste was just average.The sambal kangkung does not taste like sambal at all. Not sure what exactly it taste like.Dont recommend this place for chili crab. Food is so so onl
4
The hostess/waitress kept rushing me to see what I wanted to order while I was still trying to browse the separate food and drink menus. The busboy took my plates and chopsticks while I had the last piece of fish dumpling in my mouth. I kinda wanted to pit half of my dumpling back onto my plate instead of having to finishing it with my fingers and my food half hovering in the air.... service I would rank at 3 stars but the fish dumplings were ok. It is a convient place to eat at with free WiFi as long as you give them your phone to type their password. Not super impressed. Maybe they had a bad day.
4
This is a mid range food outlet with reasonable service and average food quality. Where it wins in the ratings stakes is its location. Situated, as it is, right on the main thoroughfare through Chinatown, you couldn't choose a better place to sit back, have a cold beer and a pretty good meal - at slightly above average prices. Watching the pedestrians/tourists is an entertainment fest in itself. The food is average and the prices are slightly above average - but the location makes up for the difference. I won't be in a hurry to go back there for a meal - but for a quiet beer while I watch the foot traffic - I don't think I could find a better place
2
The food in this place was very much below our expectations. The service was absolutely atrocious. Waitress was incredibly rude to us because we turned up at 5 mins to the lunch opening time. The food was fast but served in a very haphazard way and did not taste very nice. We had the Chilly crab a delicacy in Singapore which was very expensive but not worth it at all. I wouldn't recommend it
4
This restaurant seems to be always packed. It's because the food is cheap, fresh and delicious. Of course we ordered too much but the cost was extremely reasonable for Singapore (which can be very expensive). Beer was cheap, ordered grilled garlic prawns, fried rice, a noodle dish and some pork and prawn fried balls, like mini dimsims (which were absolutely delicious). when they came to the table there was about 12, we ate them all. Very good value for money
3
Service is quick, but not friendly at all (mass processing). Food was good - standard. A typical, very busy place in Chinatown to watch people.
4
Simply put, go here! We did not get to spend enough time in Singapore Chinatown but this was Great authentic food on the pavement with rapid pleasant service.
4
Unsure of the other places around the area, but I always find the Chinatown Restaurant friendly and the food good. Prices a relatively low for Singapore, which makes it more enjoyable. i'll be back. really enjoy people watching on the corner.
5
Simple place, very busy and not at all fancy, just amazing food at very good prices. I would certainly go back and have the chilli crab again!
4
The food that we ordered was very good and the restaurant was packed, which was why we chose it. But don't be put off by your surroundings OR the staff, who are abrupt at best, but we're actually really rude to some other customers. There is a wide selection of dishes, although perhaps a little over priced
1
The staff were ridiculously rude, the food was not fresh and it cost 3 times as much as an ordinary hawker stall. I only went in to shelter from the rain. In my 20 minutes there, I saw the staff be rude to three separate groups of people without good reason. If you’re hungry, go to the nearby Chinatown Complex for great, authentic and cheap food. This place is only good for shelter and maybe a beer
4
This is one of my favorite chinese restaurants in Singapore. Why? Because of the nice food which is not too hot and very tasty at the same time. Had chily crab tonight and loved it. A bit more expensive than restaurants around the corner but worth it. Beer is a bit too pricey though. You get tiger beer around the corner for one or two dollars less per bottle. And the location is perfect. Why not 5 stars? Probably because of the waiters. They are not attentive. You have to wave and call. Not everybody's style. Still a great place to go. I go there for years
5
In the middle of Chinatown on a thriving corner with the bustle of this vibrant area all around you. Service with a smile, drinks most reasonable found in the city and the food tasty, plentiful and a good selection to choose from. Have a Chinese meal maybe twice a year at home in UK, twice in 2 days - need we say more
4
Food was good, not awesome but good. Big variety and selections to choose from something for all.Customer service was slow and my food came out about 10 minutes apart. Entree first, then starter after about 10 min, then after about 20 min my rice.If you aren’t in a hurry, not bad but be cautious. Good place to people watch
5
This restaurant is in a lively, colourful area of China Town which we found it much more interesting than the advertised "Food Street" . Here you get the chance to 'people watch' and enjoy the beer and food at the same time - what's not to like? A range of beers on pump - not just bottled . You have to try the chilli crab - messy but delicious!!
4
Located opposite the Heritage centre, which is also well worth a visit, whilst not cheap, the food was of good quality and tasted great. Pleasant staff, who made you feel welcome.
4
This was a great stop for dinner. Wide variety of foods with their dumplings being the best. Very good and quick service, with great open atmosphere. 👍😬 Additional options of beers to choose from was refreshing.
5
Love this place for lunch and dinner or just an icy cold beer. The staff are super friendly, the food is well priced and delicious and the beer is always really really cold.
3
The food I was served here was fine; tasty, simple dishes. Service ok, if a little perfunctory. Getting a bill at the end of the meal was more of a challenge. Went to go back a couple of days later as in the area again, but didn't bother as the waitress was so rude and unwelcoming. I got up and left as plenty of competition around
4
In the middle of what seems the busiest street in Chinatown a great place to stop for lunch. Yes, lots of tourists but still great food, friendly and fast service. We tried several dishes and liked everyone of them. So give it a try. And do try the Chili Crab and YES you will need the apron!!
5
The Resturant is located in middle of the ChinaTown markets. Easily located if you have taken the MRT subway. Get of at Chinatown station and exit using exit A. This brings you right into the street, walk about 100m and your there. Red tables and yellow seats tells you, you have arrived at your destination. Food and drink are very reasonable prices and service is quick. After your fill its time to walk it of around the markets. Remember to banter for a better price on anything you wish to purchase
1
We visited this restaurant on a Saturday mid afternoon. The restaurant had a number of tables free however the aggressive server forced us to sit where she decided (near the hot kitchen). Having ordered our food we were continually scowled at by our server who then abused some other dinners for deciding to eat else where. The food was mediocre and definitely not worth being treated in such a disgraceful manner! We did complain to the manager which was responded to with a shrug
5
We always try to fit in a dinner here in Chinatown when we are in Singapore. Love the food, the atmosphere and the people watching. Have taken my Husband, children and Mum on different occasions and they all agree that it is worth the visit. Fresh food and reasonably priced drinks
2
Don’t understand “The certificate of excellence” unless you’re referring to the Tiger beer...sour faced discourteous staff, over priced food compared with other hawker stalls and the complete lack of service ( having to remove the dishes ourselves after having staff walk past and ignore us) so compared with other places .. maybe a C minus
5
This is a great spot in Chinatown for a people watch, a cold beer and good food. We always come here the first night in Singapore because it states our holiday. The noodles are great and the service is speedy. Prices are good and the beer, Tiger of course, is always cold
5
Had some lovely dim sum and craft beer. Well worth stopping when walking through Chinatown.
It's opposite the heritage centre which offers free wifi.
Seemed popular with westerners and menu had pictures making it easy to order.
5
A really nice place among various chinese shops and very good food!!! We ordered the best dumplings and a really good crab rice. Dont miss the large bottle if Tiger beer that is really good and also have some shwan rice if you like to add some spice to your meal
5
One of the pleasures of going to Singapore is dining outside. This restaurant is right in the middle of Chinatown. We are somewhat unusual as we enjoy just sitting and watching the people go by while having dinner and few beers. Most diners have a quick drink or meal and carry on with their sightseeing or shopping. We just sit! The owner is a charming lady with a great team of staff who do a great job. The Tiger girls keep the beer glasses full and cold. We eat here every time we come to Singapore and the food has improved markedly in the past couple of years. Some great spicy dishes and local favourite chilli crab. We will be bac
4
Had lunch with about 10 friends while at F1.Busy little corner restaurant which has expended recently, so must be doing something right. Food was of a good standard, drinks , beer and mixed drinks.It is close to Chinatown Station,5 minutes away. Food was typical of street type food ,satays, prawns and sweet and sour pork were for us.The girl serving us was good because of our size group and people changing their orders, some drinking more than eating. She kind of paired people who were together and did 5 separate bills which made it easy to pay at the end instead of messy calculations on who had what. Would stop here again if shopping in the area
2
Been here 4 times over the past few years. Loved it the first time, gone downhill now and won't go back. Judging by the fact few locals are seen eating here is a guide its overpriced, underwhelming food for tourists. Last two times by chicken dish has been overwhelmed by dried chilli - last night we reckon almost a cup worth in a small dish (the photo below is half of how much there was). Almost an inedible meal with dry chewy chicken. It was busy but staff disinterested. Main came and sat there 5 mins before someone noted and gave us plates and rice.
3
As it is covered it is a good place to sit the rain out opposite the Heritage Centre. I had seafood rice but I would not recommend it as it was very bland and with no soy sauce provided I could not "cheer it up". As it was busy I could not get attention either to ask for some.I thought actually for Singapore it tasted a bit average and nondescript whch surprised me after the generally good reviews on here. However, an atmospheric and popular spot which was enjoyable but not the cheapest available in the area I suspect
4
The advantage of this restaurant over the many other restaurants in China town is its perfect location in a nice street with a big terrace. A large selection of good sea food. The crab with egg was a bit on the fatty side. A very good beverage selection and good service.
5
Had the pleasure of eating at Lee's place again this trip. You can always be sure that the quality of the meals is consistent with every visit. Lee and her staff are always eager to please. The location of the restaurant allows you to sit,eat and drink and watch the world go by
5
Nice seafood restaurant in the middle of Chinatown. Can sit on both side of the street They serve fresh and delicious seafood and also chicken and Peking duck The chicken sate was a bit dry, but the fresh and delicious seafood is one of the best in town And they have big bottle of ice cold tiger !
5
Very efficient quick service by the staff. All the food we had was tasty and hot we started with delicious dumplings then a prawn dish and sweet & sour pork really good and reasonably priced , the beer is nice and cold two of my family had milk shakes the best they have had any where i was told Well worth a tr
4
Good location at the corner of the street. Good food but bit expansive. The meals are fresh and have a good flavor and texture. Big portion of food. Many dishes on the menu card.
5
Definitely come here for a meal to get the full vibe of Chinatown, beer cheap, food cheap & lots of friendly people around. Just sit and absorb the atmosphere while eating lovely food
3
Food didn't taste that good, though it looked like a popular place. Bad service. Perhaps they get all hassled when it's a full house.
4
Welcome place to sit and enjoy a drink and meal in busy market !! After your shopping or taking a break ! Good sea food and drinks at reasonable prices. Surpringly found Assam Fish head curry from North Eaast India !! Noodles , Black crab and Assam fish Head curry made a sumptuous lunch for two !Chilled beer was available .Service was good and food was tasty and reasobly priced
4
Situated on a street corner with ceiling fans and an open air setting, this certainly felt like restaurants of years ago. Nothing flash here but the service was efficient and the me most enjoyable. We had spring roll dumplings and buns which were all most enjoyable
5
My boyfriend and I visited Chinatown Seafood Restaurant twice while we were staying in Singapore and loved it both times. The food was delicious and authentic and it was nice to have quick and no-nonsense service. The fresh orange juice was the best I've had in south east Asia. We really enjoyed the Singapore Vermicelli and trying crocodile for the first time.
5
Having eaten on Clarke quay, boat quay etc, we thought we would go away from the river to avoid the high prices. First night here had selection of dumplings, prawns, Veg and rice .... all fresh, tasty and authentic. Despite other reviews, service was quick and friendly so maybe just a good night ? . Our children liked it so much we went back next night and had a different selection of dumplings, satay, Kung Po chicken and some vegetables. All just as good if not better than the first night and service just as quick and friendly . The xiao long bao had sold out by 8.30pm which was the only downside to the second visit. If you want those go early. Great value as wel
3
Looked like an interesting place walking by but the food we had was distinctly average and the service was really poor. Slow and dishes were mostly "dropped" onto the table by surely staff. We left wondering what we had done to upset them. Plenty of tourists so maybe they don't see the need to make an effort
3
We were having a fun time browsing the various stalls and shops along Pagoda Street during the early evening and decided that it was time to have a quick snack. This cafe had an open dining area located right next to the pedestrian mall and we decided to sit at a table there and enjoy a small meal and some cool drinks.Our orders were taken by a pleasant and friendly lady who appeared to be the manageress. Our shared fried rice dish and soft drinks were served by a waitress who was neither friendly nor pleasant. Perhaps she was having a bad day! The fried rice dish was large but proved to be rather ordinary. The soft drinks were served in glasses filled with ice and were cold and refreshing.It was nice to take the weight off our feet and sit there relaxing and watching "the world go by". Prices charged were reasonable without being cheap. It was just a shame that the food was ordinary and that the service was not great
4
Had a deliciously tasty meal here during a family visit to Singapore's Chinatown. Cold beer on a hot day was perfect to wash away a bit of humidity. Paired with prawn dumplings, garlic prawns, a stick of chicken satay and a laksa laden with chilli, this made for a memorable visit.
4
Ate two nights in succession.
Good food and decent value.
Great position in busy area
Would recommend
2
This place is for budget travelers who want to try local food.
No ambience to talk about.
Quality of food is from below average to average.
Prices are very low.
4
If you some Chinese food at a good price for Singapore this rest is the place to go. Try the Archipelo Bewery beer from Singapore. Well worth to try!
5
We tried a couple of appetizers our first night and were impressed enough we went back for dinner the next two nights - seafood selections are varied and delicious. Try the fried rice with greens and egg as a side.
5
Called in for a couple of beers and ended up eating - had beef fried rice and partner had veggie noodles - the best I've eaten, fresh and extremely tasty - due to heavy rain storm ended up having a few more beers than expected, great service and friendly bar owner - loved i
1
Visited this restaurant as on the main Pagoda Street drag. The waitress was so rude, miserable and vile when we sat on a table she clearly did not want to service. Food was greasy and tasteless! If you go to the next street parallel, you will find "Food Street". Much better, undercover and most importantly, some resemblance of customer service. We will not be back to China Town Seafood ever!
1
I had been recommended by a friend to go to this place for the Chilli Crab. He had visited 3 years earlier. Got to say it took a while to arrive and it looked as though the top of the crab came from another crab as it didnt fit etc. and as everything sold on weight 'crabs start at least S$55 is that ok but could be more ..' said the waitress. You are issued with an apron and a small box of tissues and boy do you need them as it will take you all that time to get what little meat there is out of the crab! The surly waitresses just want to take your money and get you out asap. Rudest people I had seen in 6 days I had been in Singapore. The crab cost over Â£40 too. Definitely not worth it!

Me and my family were there for dinner.Food took a long time to be ready and one of the dishes were never prepared even after a long 1h wait. The bill also took a long time to be ready.Very poor service from staff. They avoid customers all the time.At least the beer was cold
4
We stayed on Clarke Quay for 4 days which is extremely expensive to eat out. Good food can be found in nearby Chinatown, 5-10 min walk away. 4 x pints of beer and two mains were $66. You will struggle to get better in Singapore. This restaurant was great.
4
Good Chinese food, reasonably priced but not cheap like the food halls in shopping malls. Good atmosphere as you are in the heart of the markets. We ate here twice so second visit wasn't as good but that would come down to our good choices and trying a few different things. Overall worth eating at.
4
Recommended so we tried it. Was a very good meal. All dishes were traditional, plentiful & tasty. Drinks & food were a bit expensive compared to "food street" around the corner but pleased we ate there.
3
A great location if your wanting to sit in the middle of the hustle and bustle of Chinatown, this place delivers food and drinks that will satisfy your palate and at a price isn't as inflated as I expected.Staff were friendly and food came out quick.Not a place the locals would choose but good enough for us
5
We ate here a few times on our visit and were not disappointed. Found the chilli crab to be one of the best flavours in Singapore and a very good price comparing to others. Were not disappointed with any of the dishes we tried and it is on a corner where you can sit for ages and just people watch. Service is good and it is usually crowded at lunch and dinner
3
They are in the middle of Chinatown and on a corner, so if you have a table on the edge outside you have a nice view over the are area and people. Interior is basic, but that says nothing about the roof I experienced myself. In this case we ordered a set of satay, spring rolls, fried rice and sweet and sour pork. The food was ok but average...the service of some of the waiters is absolutely beyond acceptable level! Do something about it! Pricing is average but above the provided quality and service
5
My experience is summarized below:** Pros:- Really good food. It served one of the best chilli crabs I've ever tasted. Other dishes are good, too.- Open space. You can choose the table outside, enjoy the food and watch people walking around under the light of the lanterns. It's a true 'China Town' experience.- Price is reasonable- Staff're quite friendly. One of them can speak Vietnamese - convenient for Vietnamese tourists** Cons:- The service is not really good. The waitresses serve too quickly and almost pay no attention to their guests until they call.I highly recommend this restaurant for guys who want to try chilli crab & have an experience of street food
3
Me and my friends like the food and the hostess . The service is generally very short fused ! I've worked in plenty of restaurants where we have been slammmed but never have treated anyone the way we were treated ! Barked at by female wait staff and who refused to put my prawns back on the wok for 1 min extra ! It was a 19.00$ dish !
3
We stopped here for a light snack and had the chicken satay skewers. The chicken was of average quality and the taste was OK. If I were to order again I would try the pork or the beef.We had a street side table, and it was nice to have a little snack, drink some beer, and watch the people go by during a light rain
3
Looked busy and saw the TripAdvisor award, But to be honest the food was very average and we'll overpriced. Don't forget they add tax to the menu price's.Our meat had a lot of in bit s you simply couldn't chew on! Fair to say we won't be back.
5
A very extensive photo menu, too much to choose from! The food was fresh and delicious, with the best satay skewers in Singapore eaten here. Also ordered a seafood satay which was a little on the sweet side, but of course this was a matter of personal taste. The flat rice noodle dish with prawns was exceptional and our lime juice drinks were extremely flavoursome and refreshing.Overhead fans provide relief from the humidity in the open air restaurant. Service was fast, and the restaurant was very clean as well. Would have loved to return for another meal but we were too time limited! Make sure you bring an empty stomach :) this place comes highly recommended. Next time I will be sure to order the chilli crab. Prices were quite reasonable
4
In the middle of Chinatown, this busy restaurant serves up some delicious dishes. Prices are much higher in the tourist areas and it is possible to eat at a fraction of the price at hawker stalls, but though the prices are quite high here, the quality of the food we found to be well above average. The crab is, well, crab, expensive and overrated in my books, but all the wok food we tried here was very good, and the Szechuan snake beans were one of our favourite Singapore dishes. Cheap beer, pricy food, and a really pleasant Chinatown ambienc
3
Dropped into China town to check the area out. The food was good. Singapore noodle delicious and the chicken curry spicey. This place is about volume rather service but just raise your hand and someone is there in seconds. Give it a go
5
Good deal on Beer and freindly staff $6.95 for a large bottle of Tiger. Nice area and plenty of fans too cool down. Does seem to have a great menu but wee did not eat hear
4
This restaurant has a prime position on a corner in the heart of Chinatown, and being open-sided means that most tables provide a good and interesting vantage point for people watching. It has a mixed clientele of local inhabitants, locally domiciled ex-pats and tourists. Although it’s predominantly a restaurant, you can sit with a beer or two without eating (but note that although a prominent notice advertises a large Tiger beer at the attractive price of $6.95, and several earlier reviews comment on this cheap price, this price does not include a 10% service charge or the 7% GST tax so the price you pay is over $8 – still cheaper than many places but not quite as cheap as the notice, or previous reviews, might lead you to believe).We usually make a point of using this restaurant whenever we visit Singapore, and have generally been very happy with the experience. However, this time we went four times – twice on a visit in April and another twice on a visit in May – and although still happy (otherwise we wouldn’t have kept returning) we felt that it had gone downhill a bit (both in food and service) since our previous visits – the last one being 2 years ago. Maybe this perceived deterioration is due to their success as they have expanded into the building opposite (which used to be shops) so have more customers to cater for from the same kitchens (and presumably the same staff).One of my usual dishes (a dry dish of cereal coated prawns - $18.80) was delicious as it’s always been, but some other dishes, while OK, were not as good as we recalled. However, the chilli crab was very good and if you’ve never had it before it's a memorable dining experience and should be sampled, but do bear in mind that it’s fiddly and messy (but they give you a bib). Like most restaurants the crab is not cheap (minimum $55 for 800 gram or $68 for 1 kg crab, but although the smaller one might be sufficient, it’s worth getting the bigger size for the extra as it’s not something you have every day).Enjoyable for location, lively atmosphere with acceptable prices and although we didn’t think it as good as it used to be it’s still very good and doubtless we’ll return when next in Singapore

First of all if you like Tiger beer this is a must,a large bottle for$6.95 has to be great value. Not really to my taste but when in Singapore you should give the local beer a go.The restaurant is used by locals and tourists as the menu is extensive. Service was good but it is a big restaurant catering for a lot of people so be patient. Enjoy the buzz of Chinatown whilst you wait for the food. I had been told so much about the chilli crab that I had to try it, you can order 2 sizes but I can assure you that the smaller size is fine. It was everything that I had been told,the crab and the sauce were wonderful the 6 buns were just perfect to mop up the remaining sauce. You will not need anything else.My Wife had a more traditional dish which she greatly appreciated. Total cost including 2 Tiger beers $100 which I thought was fair. This is not fine dining but good food in a very relaxed setting
4
I had the opportunity to eat about 4 times at the Chinatown Seafood Restaurant during my first visit to Singapore. Each meals were good, well prepared and the service was nice in general. The menu had many options to offer and the staff was friendly and knowledgable. The tiger beer is a good solution to wipe off your thirst of course. Prices didn't seem to be that different from what we would pay at the Sydney Fish Market though and there are other options that are cheaper around of course. But I was quiet happy with this place since I went there 4 times.I would go back there on my next visit to Chinatown
3
The staff was pretty rude like they don't care if we wanted to order or not . The food was "ok" but 50$ for rice and noodles (just 2 plates) and two drinks is like too much . I'd preffer to find other place instead of this one .
2
A street food stall/restaurant with a 10% compulsory service charge? The food was passable - but then the competition around them is fabulous, so they do not win on that score. But the Gin Sling had no gin. As in, NONE. The price of $50 for satays and pork buns was appalling value. There are others bette
4
This is a great place to eat Chilli Crab washed down with a large ice cold Tiger at a great price. The only downside are the staff who have been rude every time we go. We can put up with the staff because the food is yummy
4
We are here for a company night out. Service was very good from the start with drinks orders taken promptly and brought. Crabs were shown to us before being cooked and would highly recommend chilli crab and also just the ordinary crab cooked to perfection perfect to share in a large group as we were were.Rice dishes all very good as was pork and dim sun and food was all brought out in a timely manner. The only reason for. Or giving it a five not a fan of plastic chairs in a restaurant for the price they are charging .Overall good evening and would recommend eating here if you are in Chinatown
5
We always make a point of eating here when we are in Singapore as we can be guaranteed a good meal with cheap beer. If you enjoy the hustle and bustle of the Chinatown markets whilst eating delicious food this is the place to be. Service is quick and usually with a smile. The steamed prawn dumplings are amazing and the honeyed pork,chicken satay and young chow rice hit the spot ! Good value all round
3
We ordered honey pork and fried rice with egg & vegetable. Very tasty but small helping and very overpriced for what you got. Service was ok but not very welcoming.
3
Went here with high expectations but was slightly disappointed might have ordered the wrong food but the hainanese chicken was really poor with really slimy nasty chicken went for more food afterwards as we were still hungry!
1
The waitress who served us was totally uninterested in being there, order mixed up, chareged for water, forgot the drinks. Meal served on plastic plates yet bill was $100 for 4 basic meals with rice.
5
If you want to enjoy street food with good taste and quality, try chinatown seafood restaurant. As its a open restaurant I would prefer Night.
3
Tasty food and good cold beer at reasonable prices for location. Hit and miss with serving staff on two visits, very chatty getting you in, it's a shame they seem far less friendly once you've sat down, though this is not uncommon in the city.
5
Great,popular restaurant.We ordered satay and a whole chili crab.They tie a bib around you,give you nut crackers and away you go - it was delicious but we needed a bath afterwards!.Satay and egg fried rice were also very good.
2
The maitredee was lovely and welcoming, the food was reasonable, however the waitress we had was the rudest waitress I have ever encounted anywhere in the world. Wrong order, lack of interest in serving us food, literally threw our plates of food on the table. Maitredee was apologetic when we complained and clearly saw there was an issue, did not offer to waive the compulsory tip however. The service really left is with a sour taste of the restaurant with what could have been a nice meal
5
They open for lunch at noon exactly and sadly I was on a tight schedule to checkout of the hotel at 2pm. I ordered the Thai Spicy Crab (not the chilli crab this time) and it arrived at 12.30pm. My wife ordered the Thai Beef with lemongrass - simply sensational with super thin strips of beef. Fortunately, she finished her meal before mine arrived and left for the hotel, because I devoured it like a neanderthal. This is the food of kings, cooked to perfection...........and served by a waitress with the personality of a female version of Basil Fawlty. I would go back for more even if she had insulted me....it was that good, and $55SGD was very good value
4
Basic street venue. Excellent for people watching. Very close to chinatown mrt station. We walked all around and this seemed the best. We did also eat in chinatown food street but this was better. Not the cheapest place but by no means expensive. We had 2 large bottles of Tiger, fried prawns, satay and shrimp dumplings for $62 but good quantity and quality
4
Ate here twice during our stay in Singapore. Their food was really good. Authentic Chinese. Tried their sweet and sour pork and fried prawn balls. Loved them. Perfect if paired with their yang chow rice. The staff we're also really nice and accommodating. Some of them knew we were from the Philippines and spoke some phrases from our language. Nice touch! A must try if you are craving for some good Chinese food
1
Overpriced and underwhelming food. Only landed up here because of the location. We ordered chilly crab, chicken rice and sweet and sour pork. The beer was the only thing we enjoyed
4
Found this restaurant whilst hiding from the rain - very good service. Food good - portion sizes large! One portion of rice too much for 3 of us!! Great atmosphere even with tropical downpours 😀
5
My sister and I have ordered 1 normal chili crab, they after that bring us a very big one that we cannot even finish it with a very reasonable price. We will definitely come back to enjoy!
3
We went here for dinner at about 8:30 pm and it was still quite busy. I have eaten here a number of times before and enjoyed theboisterous atmosphere. But the quality of the food seems to have gone down and more effort is being put into hawking customers from passersby. Our waitress had to be recalled twice from the street to deliver us our food. This is not fine dining but I would say that it is authentic Chinese street food. There is no telling when the food will come-some dishes show up immediately and some come when the other dishes have been finished. See the attached photos
3
One of the good places to chill out and bring visiting friends. They have authentic local food and cheap beers. Waiting time for food can be longer during busy periods. Most of the staff are friendly but most of them does not speak English so you have to do sign language or point on the pictures on the menu. Aside from the humidity, which is very normal in Singapore, overall experience is good. I recommend this place. Will definitey come back and bring more people.
4
A perfect dinner at this lovely sidewalk restaurant in Pagoda St at the heart of Chinatown. Although its called a seafood restaurant, there are plenty of other dishes on offer.We ordered fairly standard fare but it was delicious, fresh and piping hot. Portions were enormous; we couldn't finish everything, and the beer was really well chilled. It was very busy, but the staff were attentive and friendly, and we didn't wait very long for any dish.Well worth trying out
5
Have visited this restaurant several times over the past few years. It has a consistent high quality of food, a varied (seafood based) menu and quick service. It is often quite busy which is a good reflection of its standards. Portion sizes are very generous. Drinks selection is also quite good. Price wise I'd say it is edging towards the high side but overall it is worth it
5
Very hard to write a thorough and comprehensive review when you have only tried 2 dishes. The first was prawn dumplings with an excellent dipping sauce but the highlight was Singapore chilli crab, served with a light bread type dumpling for mopping up the delicious sauce. We were also provided with protective bibs
4
Good food,good price and right next to the MRT. Went back a few times to this place during a weeks stay in Singapore. After a long day walking around in the heat , this was ideal for sitting for a bit to recover, people watch and get some good food. Very quick service even when it was very busy. Not just for the sea food, they have plenty of other options. Recommende
4
We had a meal here after a day at the River Safari . We got the MRT and got off at Chinatown and took the Pagoda street exit. The Restaurant is about 100 mts from the Exit . We had a table right on Pagoda st which gave us a great view of the world going past . We had a couple of Pints of Tiger Beer and we ordered some Roast Duck breast . some beef & fried rice and a steam rice & vegetable , The steam rice was a little gluggy but overall the meal was delicious , and the Beer went down a treat. Very enjoyable 
4
A great stop off for lunch with nice asian menu plus cold beers. Very efficient and obliging. Try the many different dumplings and santons, great value and taste good.
4
This is not a 5 star restaurant and a doesn't pretend to be, it is honest hawker type food in the heart of Chinatown. As long as you adjust your expectations, you won't be disappointed.
4
Swissotel bar man recommended this instead of Jumbo Seafood and he was correct. The chilli crab was really good and for much less than Jumbo would have been. 68SGD for 1 kg. Speedy and friendly service. If I return I would go again.
4
Ate there on a couple of occasions during a recent visit to Singapore. Great service and very good food. Happy with the price. What more does one need!

CSR was recommended by a friend's husband who lives in Singapore.We had lunch on a recent visit to Chinatown. Food was cooked properly and tasty. They have ceiling fans under the roof to keep the air circulating as it was very humid and hot as you would expect in Singapore. My husband ordered the lunch so it wasn't quite what I would have ordered, but still good. He likes different things to me, more to the fried style me more noodles or steamed so I would rate the lunch average only because of that reason.However the real stand-out star of the lunch was in fact a strawberry milkshake my son ordered. It was probably the best milkshake I have ever had. If the lunch was rated just on the milkshake it would have been a rating of 5 bullet marks. It was so cold, even as we finished our lunch. My son had not finished the milkshake and said he was too full for anymore as he's a young kid still. I thought I would taste a bit to see if it was okay as he had been drinking it for a while and it was milk on a hot steamy day. I kind of expected it to be a little bit warm as a reasonable expectation in the heat. What I tasted was something absolutely icy cold still and tastiest milkshake in an old style milkbar cup: the large metal silver ones. All the flavouring or strawberry they used was mixed in properly and it was thick enough. It wasn't sickening as strawberry milkshakes can be if too much flavouring is used. I put it up there as probably the best one I've ever tasted / drunk.If I ever return I will be having one of those strawberry milkshakes, ice ice cold baby to keep myself cool in the Singapore heat
5
We had lunch here recently and were immediately welcomed by two lovely waitresses. Both girls provided great service and shared a good laugh with us throughout our stay. The menu was extensive and the prices were reasonable, particularly considering a number of other chinese seafood restaurants across Singapore. The food was well presented in good servings and was absolutely delicious and the beer was colds. The location was also great for people watching as it was on one of the main corners that provided a thoroughfare between one area of Chinatown towards the parallel chinese food street. Definitely worth a visit
5
I have been to the Chinatown seafood restaurant a number of times now. The beer is always ice cold and if you order 3 large they will put it in a bucket of ice. The restaurant sits on a busy street and the people watching is grand. Numerous fans keep a good breeze going for the out door seating. I have ha a number of food dishes here also. The laksa is one of my favorites. The baby honeyed squid is crunchy and makes a great bar snack. The string ray and crocodile are also very good.
4
Called here for a meal and a drink on a couple of accasions on my trip to Singapore. The service is quick and the menu choice i extensive. The Tiger Beer is cold and very welcome on a hot day. The Hunan Chicken rice and Fried Honey Baby Squid are particularly good. A pleasant experience
5
We passed this place by walking around in Chinatown. The lady out front did her best to get us to stop, but we smiled and kept going. But we walked around a few more blocks and didn't see anything that appealed to us, so we went back. She treated us like royalty for returning, and the food was fantastic. We had a couple of different kinds of dim sum that were delicious. The place looks a little touristy--right on a busy corner in Chinatown--but the food really is great and you can't beat the people-watching. When we return to Singapore, we will seek this place out
4
Recently visited Singapore with my husband and ate at the Chinatown Seafood Restaurant on two occasions - sweet and sour pork was a little overcooked but the vegetarian fried rice was excellent. On the second occasion we had the Singapore Chilli crab was was very mild in flavour although the crab was huge! We felt the flavour was mild to suit European palates as a visit to Gluttons Market later in our trip exposed us to a really spicy chilli crab which was more to our taste. Service is efficient and the $6.50 tiger beers were an excellent accompaniment. The restaurant appears to mainly cater to visitors
5
Very good Chinese food we visited twice on our trip to Singapore. The restaurant is in the middle of the hustle and bustle of china town and it is fun sitting there with a beer people watching.
5
Excellent authentic food in an outdoor covered space on a busy corner in the heart of the hustle and bustle. Delicious food, cold beer and helpful service. Order the laksa!
2
As I have a lot of experience in Chinese food, I will say the food in this restaurant is really not up to standard. We ordered crabs, steamed fish, steamed shrimp, clams, bamboo clam, dim sum and vegetable. Almost all of them are disappointing. If you tried in the past and felt that the food was good, I will say that you can find much better food in other place
5
We were hot, sweaty, weary travellers going througg Chinatown when right in the middle we came across this bustling little street side restaurant. The clientele was a mix of both locals and tourists and as we contemplated getting a table a lady dining there told advised us we should go in the beer is cold and the spring rolls amazing. So we grabbed a table and we weren't disappointed. The beer was cheap and cold. The spring rolls, crispy prawn balls, chicken satays and the wontons were all amazing. Great place to break up a day of walking around Singapore
4
We came here twice on our visit to Singapore, it was so good. The second time we had fried rice with beef, chicken buns, honey rib beef and chicken gong bau. I was beautiful. Such a great place in the middle of Chinatown to sit and people watch and then shop!
4
I have eaten here many times over the years.The food is always a good quality and because it's right in the heart of Chinatown it's fun to sit and watch the world go by.The service can sometimes be a bit slow when it gets busy, but the food is good quality. A good place also just to grab a bucket of cold beers and snack with some friends
4
Hot, busy, chaotic, hungry? Here is a safe and convenient choice for lunch. They offer a wide selection of Chinese food rather than just seafood and a full range of fruit juices, beer, etc. We wanted a light lunch so we shared pot stickers and steamed BBQ pork buns. This was perfect prep for our visit to the Buddha Tooth Temple. We heard others comment later that they were regulars t this restaurant when in the area. There may be more interesting or otherwise 'better' places around, but this place was just fine
3
Maybe that was not right t'me for them/ The night where we celebrate Chinese new year = Roster =/ It was too much crowded service was terrible/ the taste was ordinary/ But it was very cheap. My family did not like overall. Through the street there are better ones. The only advantage is bill. The restaurant is valid for low budged travelers.
5
Food and drinks are quite reasonably priced but the food was awesome. A great bite from normal to spicy depending on what you want. Fast service in the middle of Chinatown. We actually walked back here for another meal it was so good. You won't be disappointed
4
This is a great place to eat! Chinatown is always a must see, so while you are there be sure to stop here to eat!It's a very large restaurants with lots of staff so not a lot of waiting! The food is very good and so is the serviceGreat for a walk in and eat kind of meal
5
Though this is not really the best to eat Laksa, I really appreciate how delicious it was. They accept credit card payment with minimum spend of SGD20. too bad didnt other dishes as I was only passing by and urging to eat laksa.
4
This corner restaurant just up from the MRT station is very busy, excellent food and service. As usual a wide range of food to choose from. Good value too.
2
My husband and I saw how busy the restaurant was and assumed that this was a reflection of the quality of the food. Nope. Rude staff, terrible atmosphere and bland food. Won't be back and wouldn't recommend.
5
We ate here almost evry day on our recent trip to Singapore. The staff are very friendly and the choice of food is never ending. Prices are very reasonable for Singapore. This is the place to sit and watch the world go by, a people watchers paradise
5
this restaurant blends great local seafood, good service, at a reasonable price, with the high energy level in the heart of Chinatown. The crab is as good as any on the East Coast seafood restaurants, at half the price, and you can have it many different ways: Chile, pepper, egg yolk, and more... Their salted egg yolk prawns and spicy green beans are our favorites. Add a couple bottles of Tiger beer -- also reasonably priced -- and you have a great experience of food, culture, history, and interesting people. Not to mention that Singapore's Chinatown is one of best anywhere
4
Looked up the internet to find restaurants serving good chili crab but not as pricey, and it brought us here. The chili crab price here follows the market price, so ask before entering the place. We ordered the 800gram chili crab (minimum size) and shared it for two people. Chili crabs tastes great although it is very messy.The place is jam packed with people, and you can see the waitresses running around here and there. Just remind them when your order takes a while to come out, since it is super full
4
Our first visit here was mainly for drinks but we also enjoyed some mixed satay - which was really good. The beer is a good price S$ 6.95++ for a large bottle of Tiger beer.I think we were seated in a smoking area because other guests near us were smoking whilst other table were eatingWe came back on another night and requested a none smoking table. This visit was for dinner and we ordered a selection of dishes. Beef with lemongrass, chicken curry, spicy fried rice and Singapore vermicelli. All really good. There was too much for the 2 of us to eat. 3 dishes would have been enough for us.The waitress was friendly and gave us some advice when we were ordering and steered us away from a hot and sour dish. Great place to watch the world go by in Chinatown
4
Review is really extreme here in TripAdvisor. But anyway, I had a good dinner / supper in here. Me and my bf ordered a lala cooked with onion and garlic (excellent) , samba stingray (normal), tomyam seafood soup (potion too small but taste not bad) and two rice and one beer. Pricing is consider average in Singapore dollar but is definitely not affordable for Malaysia ringgit.
4
If you're in the China town area, it's well worth visiting this restaurant. Prices are very reasonable, the food is good & plentiful, and the place is extremely popular. Extensive menu with some unusual dishes, and polite & efficient service. Some tables are a bit cramped, but the staff will do their best to seat you where you wish. Recommended
1
We were very hungry looking for good food in Chinatown. Since this place was packed with people we were under the impression that the food served here must be good - but we were soo wrong... The dish that we ordered was served and we tried to eat it but gave up after 5 minutes... No taste, very dry, not able to actually identify what it was that was prepared... we paid and left to Clark Quay to look for something eatable
1
Food is not great, completely overpriced and the service is so bad, people are rude!
We waited almost 1 hour for our chicken rise! Will NEVER go back!
4
came across this restaurant at chinatown. staff was ready to welcome you even at 11 pm when most of the restaurants around close.food is great,tried the black pepper crabs,sichuan prawns,seafood fried rice,huge portions yummy food!
5
Amazing food! Great prices and menu! We couldn't find yum cha and we lucked out in the biggest way to find this gem! Thank you to everyone here!
4
Service was a bit slow to start with, but the food was excellent. Even though it's a seafood restaurant I saw two tables with S&S Pork as I walked in, so I followed their lead. It was excellent and very tasty. Nice spot to just sit and watch Chinatown and it people do their thin
3
It seems it is the place for people watching, food tastes average. Service average and attitude mercenary.Large bottle of beer is close to SGD10. Cost of dishes per plate you would expecting at SGD12 or more depending on the type of food. Seafood fried rice, about SGD 12, Fried mixed vegetables about SGD14. Basically you would not find this place worth dinning in
4
This is a very good restaurant in Chinatown,the girls are quick and efficient,the food was excellent and the beer ice cold,very nice place to sit and watch the hectic market scene,We ordered a large tiger beer and 2 cold glasses because the heat in Chinatown makes the beer go warm quickly.My wife had sliced beef in ginger steamed rice,I had Tom Yam seafood soup followed by breast of duck and rice.all the food was delicious and sat with another couple of Tigers and soaked in the atmosphere well worth a visit
4
Visited here as we were after some Chinese Seafood and the name suggested we'd get what we were looking for. The food here is good and the prices are extremely reasonable. We had no issue with the service and we enjoyed it. The restaurant is basic but that's what we were after. If passing you can eat here with confidence.
4
We where with 5. We took a chilli crab with steam buns..... and 8 other dishes of the menu.All was to our satisfaction, especially the chilli crab :)Its a very busy place in china town. Nice to sit doen have a meal, a drink and watch people go by
2
When I review a place, it has to tick all the boxes for me to give a good review, good service, good food, good prices, the full package, unfortunately this is not the case with this restaurant, They try so hard to get you in, but when your there, they just forget about you, so the beers are more expensive then the rest, charging $9.40 for a Tiger, whereas the night before $8, OK so a Dollar fourty, not a big deal, any way we ordered our meal, and waited, and waited and then my fiancÃ© food came out, mine 15 mins later and then had to ask for the plain rice we ordered because we had waited another 10mins by this time, and I didn't want to just eat plain white rice by itself, also ordered another beer, that never come, wouldn't of minded but we was sat in front of the fridge, oh and then they had the cheek to charge us for it, "I don't think so" a little annoyed at this point we paid and left with a bad taste in our mouths. A good tip for this establishment, take away half your tables that way, the waiters can focus on what customers they have, not running around like headless chickens! Such a shame!!!!

We stopped for lunch during a busy day shopping in Chinatown. Chinatown Seafood seems to have a large following with most tables full and lots of people.m coming and going.We took a table nearest the street so we could watch everything going on. You really feel like you are part of the action.We ordered a Tiger straight away and left it to the waitress to bring us the food. It was all fresh and exactly what we needed. We started with fresh steamed prawns in chilli along with salt and pepper squid. Fantastic.For mains we had two small crabs, one with black pepper and the other Singapore chilli. Make sure you also request the sweet rolls for the chilli sauce. Awesome.We finished with a few more Tigers's and some fresh fruit to finish off.While it is in the centre of Chinatown and aimed at the tourists, the food was fresh and reasonably priced. Will go again and worth the visit

A typical tourist trap next to the MRT - Food is okay, nothing to get excited about but its great to shelter from the rain and enjoy watching people go by!!
5
We have used the restaurant on numerous occasions with team building from work and the service is great as is the food
3
Clean Plastic table & chairs. Food fresh & tasty. Beers and wine on the drink list. The waitresses were serious and borderline grumpy. Reasonable food.
4
I ordered Singapore Chilli Crab. Not cheap, but it tastes great. Could be very crowded, esp when its rain.
4
Stopped here for lunch. We have been here before for chilli crab which is fabulous but this time went for duck and dumplings. Just what was needed after a long walk and especially with a nice tiger beer.
5
An open air restaurant with very large choice on menu. We had the whole crab in ginger and spices and it was really very good. We also had Singapore noodles with bean sprouts and various vegetables...it was delicious. We would strongly recommend this restaurant. The service was excellent and prices very reasonable.
3
We went here lured by the cheap (for Singapore) tiger beer. We ordered a variety of dishes non of which overwhelmed us for the price. The service felt fast and furious and we felt quite rebellious ordering extra beer after we had finished eating but 'hey' we were on our holidays. If It was a great place to people watch but I'm sure there are better places to eat in China Town.

This restaurant is in the heart of Pagoda Street - it's noisy, busy and has tasty dishes...typical of high turnover establishments in Chinatown.Went here for a meal around 8.30pm tonight (New Years Eve) - thoroughly enjoyed a dish of Pork dumpling noodle soup plus a starter of crispy anchovies - that was a really good - slightly sweet; it was delicious.The menu is extensive, the dining area is open and mainly undercover - staff are efficient and work with a really good sense of urgency.It is a quick turnover restaurant - just right for a break from shopping in Chinatown

It was raining heavily, we would like to just have an afternoon tea rest in the restaurant. It looked like the usual coffee shop so we thought we could grab the "teh Tarik" ( the famous drink in most of coffee shop in Singapore). We decided to sit down, and looked at the menu that was given to us. Suddenly my boy was very busty and wanted to go toilet. Knowing that the place (so called restaurant) had a toilet , i decided to bring my boy to the toilet while my husband was looking through the menu. After coming back from toilet, looked through the menu and couldn't find the drink we wanted. We decided to leave the place and wanted to head for other place to take our afternoon tea, (which we did go to nanyang coffee nearby after that) since all the drinks there are soft drinks and our family don't drink soft drinks apparently.One of lady staff with Chinese Mainland accent, telling us off rudely and nastily scolded us for using their toilet freely without eating any food. She scolded us that we wanted to run away after using their toilet. We were just trying to explain gently but she was LOUD and scolded us vulgarity in chinese too( and my husband (who can speak Chinese)was really angry and answered back to her. They almost got into fight but I pulled my husband away and walked out from the place. There was another lady staff who was standing in the entrance who humbly apologised for her colleague's action and rude words. I hope that the restaurant would have a better customer service as there are so many tourists in Chinatown. Isn't Singapore customer service standard is a world class? We were truly disappointed and never visited there again. I have spread the words around my friends here too of this incident
2
this has good food but as for the service "what service" non existent sat at a table for 15 minutes waiting 2 waitresses stood in a corner having a chat and ignoring everyone when I got up and approached them for some service I thought I had asked them to do the impossible at long last I got the beer when the food arrived it was thrown on the tablenot a pleasant experianc
4
Every time we are in Singapore this is the place you can relax and enjoy a whole chilli crab with six small rolls and a local beer.
3
The food was good when it came, but the waitress only put in half of our order so we had quite a long wait. But it was a nice place to sit and watch the world go by.
5
Eating at this place for the 5th time at least and love it. Prices are ok and it just tastes great. Beer is nice and cold, staff friendly and the location gives it an nice touch. Strongly recommend this place!
4
There are many kinds of dishes but very hard to choose one of them. I prefered to eat Singapore Char Kway Teow and liked it very much. Tiger beer was also tasted good. I suggest everyone to eat there.
5
Singaporean Chilli Crab!! 💕 so much love for this restaurant! they serve the best chilli crab in Singapore! It's really worth the price 😍
4
Great food with speedy service. Given Singapore prices this restaurant offers great value for money. Excellent place to people watch too.
4
Had dinner at the Chinatown Seafood Restaurant, very busy place and definitely a tourist destination and locals as well. Had the generic Chinese food with then trying to sell the tourist options to us of sweet and sour pork and fried rice. Had very delicious Szechuan style for in a great fish soup and beans with chilli, fresh made dim sum was really great too. Worst calamansi juice I had tasted on my trip. The service was ok staff where very short with you but I expect that from a high turnover street corner restaurant. The restaurant is quite expensive for what you get but food was very delicious. Would definitely return someday
4
Although this is a rather touristy spot, the food is good and fresh and the staff cheerful and efficient.There is a good mix of Cantonese and other local specialities such as Chilli crab , and the beer is cold and cheap.Situated on Pagoda Street, about half way down, it makes for good people viewing alongside the food
2
When we arrived we were checking the menu and after a couple of seconds a waitress arrived to offer help! However when I asked about the different dishes she was rude and not welcoming! My sister was hungry and she really want to eat something so we decided to go in! Again, when we were ordered the waitress was again very rude and serve us with no manners! Unbelievable! I asked if there was something wrong and just said no! At least the food was ok but the service...
4
The thirst thing (lol) - if the beer aint served cold it aint worth eating there. So luckily it ticked that box. Seriously though, great place to eat in the heart of the mall. Mid range prices, efficient service. Worth a look - but then again there are soooooo many places to eat this place just one of many that would garner a similar review Im sure. Across the road (MRT entrance end and where to over passes link the other shopping precinct) there is far better food market type food with heaps of selection. In particular the bakeries! Yummy savour stuff for a quick snack.
3
The service is pushy, and they try and get you in and feed you very quickly, and get you are. The food was dry and the after effects of the chili were not pleasant. Very average.
5
Try the pork dumplings they were awesome!! They ladies were very helpful and efficient. Organised chaos, love it.
4
Big menu with lots of choices and sidewalk tables so you can order a bite and drink a super cold beer.
I had the soup dumplings. They were good and the service was fast, polite and attentive.
3
We decided to dine there instead of other interesting looking restaurants, for the "TripAdvisor" advert. We were very disappointed by the services, and the high prices for some dishes we went for, say crabs. Will not go there again
4
We were pretty happy with this place. The prawns were fantastic, and not badly priced. The local beer was well priced for Singapore. A few people have complained about the service here but we found it to be fairly appropriate for the type of place; a hustle and bustle street side market restaurant with efficient, no-frills service. We'll head back there for sure; we'd rather that than pay $200 for a fake smile :
1
When to check out the place as about to patronize the place while family member still shopping next door. Ask for some direction and experience bad service provided by a Chinese lady- waitress , speak rude and not welcoming guest.A Thai look alike waitress step in the conversation later and make thing worst.Speak very rude and not welcoming guest.Immediate I cancel my plan and walk off the place.There after I when in to the web and look into review by others about the place and realized I am not the first one to complaint and I was lucky to change my mind
4
We were staying at marina bay so wanted to get out and check out china town. Stopped here for dinner which was great, nothing fancy but great food and service and for a good price! We had the wontons spring rolls, satay chicken sticks and pork dumpling soup with wine and beers for under $70.00! Also a good place to eat and watch everyone walk by
5
Love everything about this place. Always busy but service good and staff continually keep the tables clean and cleared. Toilet also kept fresh and cleanGreat food with generous portions. Chilled large bottles of tiger beer whilst people watching kept my husband entertained whilst I enjoyed a shopping spree in the marketSituated beside Singapore Heritage Centre which is worth a visi
5
We re-visited after our last trip to Singapore last year and the food is still great and the cold beer still $S6.50 for a 650ml Tiger. This is a busy cafe so the food may come out in stages and it is a bit chaotic but watch the sights and have another cold beer, the portions are large and the menu huge to suit all tastes, it's all freshly made hence the wait, but the staff are friendly despite being rushed off their feet, worth the trip to Chinatown just for this place
1
Do not buy your seafood meal on the Bayfront. I told waitress we were new in town and wanted to try the chilli crab, she advised us on crab type and size required for the two of us. Expensive is not the word, s$590 (Â£350) we could have had a three course fine dinning experience, rather than 1 dish, 4 bread rolls and a jug of beer. I refused to pay service charge as we took advice from a waitress that clearly ripped us off.
4
Nov 2016. After wandering china town for souvenirs. Stop and got a table with tiger beers for less than 7 local dollars and wontons. Service quick and atmosphere relaxing people watching on a Thursday evening.
4
Dishes is good but I was impressed by active and interesting staff. She was humorous and quite quick.
5
Great athmosphere while enjoyng good food and cold beer. A lot of life around the restaurant which is well protected against heavy rain although it´s located near the bazars. Money value, excellent.
3
The staff were welcoming and were very patient answering to our queries regarding the menu. We ordered the cereal prawns and the yang tzou fried rice. There are other food choices such as the chilli crabs, duck breast and other fried rice varieties. The food was served quickly. The cereal prawns is a must-try
4
Get off the MTA at Cinatown and less than a minute from the exit you are sitting in this large place, watching the massive crowds laugh at you as you struggle with the very tasty chilli crab. A terrific place to eat Sinaporean signature dishes if you are time poor (as I was just before leaving for airport) and want to eat, get back and clean up and leave. Might not be the best but is pretty good
4
Good variety of local food . Lively atmosphere . A bit expensive but then Singapore is. Food was fresh and delicious . We chose a variety of dishes and shared and it was a feast ! Be careful not to choose too much as the portions are big
5
Honest to god the best chocolate milkshake we have ever had in the whole world!! We stopped here for an ice tea (fantastic) and my husband decided on the choco shake, great decision, I don't like chocolate milkshakes but this was out of this world. The lady behind the bar that does the drinks is an awesome friendly lady and was so nice to us. We decided to have tea here that evening and were very impressed with the food, the pork and beef fried rice are delicious, we ended up having tea here almost every night of our stay because the staff were so friendly, made us feel very comfortable and always put us at a table under a fan. We didn't wait long even though most times we went in they were crazy busy, it is smack bang in the middle of Chinatown and just a few steps away from the MRT they have people coming and going all over the place so we were impressed with the service, we were also really impressed with how they always made sure we were good for drinks and empty glasses and plates were taken away pretty much as soon as we finished. If you are wanting a nice, filling, reasonably priced meal, nice smiley staff and topped off with an out of this world chocolate shake then this is the place to visit
4
A rather interesting restauratant. Thew waiters are luring on customers to come in their restaurant, which is fine. The seats are plastic, which is not common for a restaurant. The waiters spoke a foreign language to me when ordering my food, even though they spoke English to me when I wanted a seat. The food is okay, but the tables and chairs are rather dirty. I am not too sure if i would recommend the restaurant to anyone due to it is not awful, but not amazing either
1
Just been out for a meal with my husband to this "restaurant" we ordered Singapore sling (small glass tasted of very little!), a coke. Starters were Spring rolls (all batter hardly any filling), shrimp won ton (again all fried no filling), fried prawn and chicken rolls (dripping with grease and no taste). Ten minutes before our starters came out 1 main of schezuan deep fried chicken was thrown on the table in front of us we didn't even see who put it there! We asked what it was and she said it was ours. It consisted of dried fried batter bits with no meaty chicken pieces at all in, and peanuts and dried red chillies pieces not fresh . The whole dish was dry and unappealing . Chicken curry consisted of smallest bowl of curry tasted ok but had 5 small chunks of chicken with skin on dark meat. Small bowl of rice was OK. This meal was $95.80 . When we complained and said we had eaten only bits of starters. The won tons and fried prawn rolls were greasy and horrible but hardly touched the schezuan chicken so could they knock it off the bill they refused.. all in all they were rude did not listen to us... I know we are in a foreign country but thought they would be apologetic.. nothing.I am not a fussy eater and rarely complain but this was truly awful...... DO NOT EAT HERE YOU WILL BE DISAPPOINTED AND RIPPED OF
1
Went here with a group for a meal only to be served what looked like a pile of dried breadcrumbs and chillies . After complaining to the owner was told thank you for your feedback but we are still charging you for all the food you sent back . Wouldn't recommend to my worst enemy
4
Best place in Chinatown to people watch. Very friendly service and very efficient too.
Does have some vegetarian options which was good. All in all a very decent dining option in Chinatown.
4
A flavoursome meal from a very extensive menu. Quick service and pleasant surroundings, enabling diners to watch the happenings of Chinatown.
5
While walking in China Town, I saw TripAdvisor recomendation and went in. All delicious sea food plates, good service and very modeste prices. You get more than you expect from a street restaurant. If you are around dont try other places, just trust TripAdvisor
5
The food quality is always excellent. Ambiance is great. Very 'happening'. We've been here many times and have enjoyed every evening immensely. Really good value for money. Typically Singapore.
1
We wait very long. Then they forgot the rice and the personal was always very unfriendly. I will never go here again.
5
Went here twice during a four day stop at Singapore. Both occasions were for lunch. Gets very busy from 1130 through till 3. So many choices and all excellent value. Easy menu to understand and the staff are very enthusiastic, understanding and will tell you about every dish. If you like beef in black pepper get the number 42. Outstanding. Will be back.
5
We went to Chinatown seafood based on the recommendation of some friends who had eaten there before, the restaurant is well position within Chinatown and less that 100 metres from the Chinatown MRT exit.We ordered four dishes in total, Black pepper beef, fried prawn balls, shrimp dumplings and fried chilli chicken. The food was amazing and well priced, the meals were all incredibly tasty. We were there early and the crowds got quite large as we sat and enjoyed the meal. With the number of people seated eating it was obvious to anyone passing by that the food was well worth trying. I sat and watched as the meals arrived fresh and hot from the kitchen, there were so many option to choose from and they all looked delicious. Be sure to wash it all down with a tiger!We would definitely eat there again
4
Every time when in Singapore come to this place. Food is excellent. Service is good and fast. Plastic chairs and tables. They've got separate smoking tables. Prices are good, neither the cheapest nor expensive place. Some disadvantages - sometimes there is too hot, fans on celling are not enough. When very busy waiters can forgot to bring something from your order, but it can even help when you ordered too much. We've been there one time on Chinese NY too, it was very crowded everywhere, but we were lucky to get table there without pre-booking. Good place to have lunch, dinner during China town familirization / visit
5
Right in the heart of China Town this place serves a large range of great food reasonably priced, and with good, quick service. All the dishes that you could want - from dim sung to chillied crab. Sit here, drink iced Tiger Beer, eat great food and watch the world go by (or the football on the TV depending on your taste). All for a really decent price. Highly recommended
5
Now a tradition that we spend one night at the seafood restaurant every time we are in Singapore. A "must do"Sit and watch the crowds pass by , while enjoying the best Seafood in townChilli crab, fresh cooked and served with a bib - very messy, however the taste is fantastic !!
5
This large busy restaurant is on a corner in the market. Plastic chairs, plastic plates and glasses but the food is fantastic! Large portions so you could share one main course between two adults. Also a great spot for people watching,
1
So popular and busy, so you may like it. We didn't, and I don't see any reason for liking it other than the cold beer (not that cheaper than other places after all), given the great choice of better options around
4
Rude chinese families
But food is super great and fast service ㅋㅋㅋㅋ too bad it's really crowded
Oh well
3
Nice corner restaurant right in Chinatown, very popular place and gets very busy, food is ok and prices reasonable
1
Used to be a good place with great, generous portions of food and beer. Not anymore, food has decreased in quality and prices are no longer competitive.
5
Came here by chance 4 years ago, was so good we came 2 nights in a row.
This time we returned for lunch and the cheap tiger beer!
Still good, seafood especially. If we ever come back to Singapore then we will be back.
4
Normally use this place while in Chinatown for a Tiger beer or two but have also eaten here this trip and the food was not bad, it was fresh and well cooked and tasty, staff are friendly and there was not too long a wait even though the place was packed. Would eat there agai
4
This is a little touristy, but a great spot to watch the passing foot traffic in Chinatown.On Pagoda Street, it is easy to find by bus, MRT or foot, and everything on the menu is of a consistently high standard.Personally I don't think it is the best Chilli crab, but it is good, and the staples of Kung Po chicken, sweet and sour dishes and pot stickers are excellent, as are the veggie plates - kale and spicy green beans are superb.The beer is some of the cheapest in Singapore, and the staff are efficient and friendly.If you want a "safe" and good Chinese, then this is the place to be
5
I was just checking out the foods and prices, but then ended up eating here 'cause the lady was so friendly! She recommended Laksa to me, and I took it; so delicious and I didn't even ate all, because there was so much food. Ordered also a Kiwi Smoothie! Yammii!
5
The promise of a "cold Tiger" is hard to resist, particularly when combined with delicious satay sticks and prawn fritters. Couldn't find a better place to relax and watch the Chinatown hustle and bustle. The food is very good and reasonably priced, and the service is friendly - we went back a number of times and were never disappointed
5
Great place to people watch and enjoy some chilli crab! the food is delicious, prices reasonable, although crowded at times worth the enjoyment
3
Located on a busy corner in Chinatown with open air seating. Large menu. Dined on chicken rice, which was not much to brag about but acceptable. Service was prompt.
5
Loved by locals and western oriënted People.
Lot of different dishes.
Icecold Tigerbeer ;)
Loved the Meehoon Singapore!
3
Chinatown Seafood is an open sided restaurant in Chinatown' Pagoda Street, offering a wide range of seafood - crab, squid, clams, prawns, lobsters, and fish - and other Chinese food.It's specialty is large mud crabs, which can be done with chili, black pepper, ginger, or black bean sauce. Prices are seasonal.The only complaint I have about this restaurant is that our waitress seemed more interested in playing with her cell phone than looking after us
4
We spent a very enjoyable hour here, right opposite the Chinatown Heritage Centre, having lunch today, people watching along the busy Pagoda road. Prompt and friendly service, large bottles of Tiger beer at reasonable prices, and the food.....we had chicken Satays - 10 - a huge portion of sweet & sour pork with all the trimmings, and seafood fried rice, plus a couple of beers and some water. All for under $60. Best value meal so far here. Fast food but good food. Recommended
5
I took my parents here as a matter of convenience. The prices were slightly high, the menu items for the most part generic, and the diners almost exclusively foreigners. The restaurant is good at what it does - providing pseudo-local dishes geared for the western palate. The servings are good sized. Everyone at my table was happy at the meal's end.I was slightly worried that ordering crocodile meat would result in redressed chicken (every Singaporean knows deer meat = pork), but it tasted like it had been sliced and packed at the nearby crocodile farm. Very pleasant.
5
It was our first choice in Singapore and not disappointed at all. The sweet and sour pork with pineapple was incredible tasty and fresh. The food is coming so fast and so fresh that you cannot stop to eating at all. The ice-cold Tiger beer was one of the best beer in town.We so loved it that we got back again the third night.I will recommend to everyone who visit Chinatown in Singapore.Best value for cheap and fast service
5
In the middle of china townGoood food and good portionsPrices are reasonableVery nice staffAlittle bit crowded which made the staff forget the appetizer which came after we finished eating but the owner is a very nice woman , i just enjoyed that nigh
5
This restaurant serves lots of accessible dishes and has an English menu and very helpful staff who can advise and prevented us from over ordering as the portion sizes are generous.It is situated right in the heart of Chinatown and also makes a great place to have a cool beer whilst "people watching"
5
Delicious chilli crab!! juicy and meaty, it's good that hey offer different sized crabs to suit people's appetite. I got the 1.5kg, shared between 2. It was definitely enough once we had ordered a heap of other food!!!The gong bao chicken was also a table favourite, along with the deep-fried prawn balls! YUM - our dinner kind of turned out into half yum-cha, half proper dinner. Definitely recommend hitting this place up if you're craving delicious crab! I know it's one of my go to's when I'm in town
5
This is a great place to stop for an icy cold beer when the heat catches up with you. Staff friendly and not pushy. Comfy spot to stop in the middle of all that shopping.
4
The place is noisy and hot because it is open but the food was good, chili crab and chicken rice is highly recommended....
3
My family together with friends went to Chinatown Seafood Restaurant for lunch because it is the closest to the hostel we were staying. I ordered chilli crab since it is one of the famous food in Singapore. I was disappointed that the inside of the crab shell has been scraped clean. I was expecting to open the crab myself but unfortunately it was already open. The food here was average in my own standards, the drinks were not cold enough to quench my thirst. At the end of the meal, my wife paid almost an equivalent of Â£150. The crab alone was very expensive. I think it's better to go to Chinatown street food for better choices. It started raining while we were there and we waited for the rain to stop before leaving but we were told to vacate the table
5
We ate at this restaurant tonight and it was one of the best Chinatown meals we have ever had! If you are travelling to Chinatown on the MRT, exit for Pagoda St and the restaurant is a few metres ahead on your right. The chairs and tables may be plastic, but the food is fresh and delicious and the service is superb. The lovely lady owner gives you little tips, like which chilled on your dish are not too spicy to eat and I would absolutely recommend going there to eat. The prices are also very good, including the beverages. Top notch
4
In the heart of Chinatown, this restaurant offers great food and very cold beer.Their seafood fried rice is full of mixed seafood and also their satays are excellent.Whenever we visit Singapore, this restaurant is a must as we know we will obtain good food and service. Well worth a visit
4
This is busy restaurant there are lots of tables so you can usually get a seat. The food is really good and served quickly and it is not expensive nor is the beer (for Singapore - which is one of the most expensive cities I have ever visited). A good restaurant choice and not just frequented by tourists as there were many locals there as well
4
An open air street corner diner with plastic tables and chairs and passing pedestrians within arm's reach.But, an extensive (illustrated Asia-style) menu with a wide range of fresh seafood (some still swimming in tanks) beautifully cooked and very tasty. We didn't even look at desserts, and paid under $50 for a great introduction to a few days in Singapore. The fact that it was packed with locals speaks for itself
1
Being in the heart of Chinatown, we decided to try this restaurant and ordered the restaurant's signature dish Chili Crab. We ordered a 1kg big crab and asked to see the live crab before cooking. The waitress showed us a nice big crab and we were happy until we saw what we got on the plate. Instead of the 1kg crab we were shown, we got a very small 600g crab with very little crab meat. We didn't bother to complain as the waitress was very rude. It's a real pity that this restaurant with such good location has to cheat its customers. Obviously they don't seem to care about returning customers
3
This place is definitely worth a visit if your looking to try the famous Singapore Chilli Crab. After researching trying to source the best experience for the chilli crab feast, this place stood out. I wanted to go somewhere that not only provided delicious food but also had a great atmosphere. We were seated out the front of the restaurant so we could people watch as the bustling chinatown streets come alive around us. Staff were a bit pushy and very much just wanted to get customers in the door, so if you expect that on your visit you won't be disappointed. The food however was utterly delicious, the juicy chilli crab had just enough heat so it wasn't to spicy, especially if you can't handle your heat that well. There were pieces of crab meat all throughout the generous sauce and the crab itself was very tasty. The minimum price for the crab was approximately $55 SD which I thought was fair. Make sure to order the fried buns with the crab as this is an amazing accompaniment. The Seafood fried rice was also very tasty. Definitely would recommend to anyone.
1
We asked for a 1 Kg crab and got a crab weighting 600 g including the sauce and the take-away plastic container. The waitress was very unfriendly and tried to cheat us. She promised us several times that the crab was 1 kg. Finally we could weight it and it was 600 g. Restaurants like this should be closed
5
Fantastic restraunt in the heart of China town. Friendly staff serving delicious chicken rice and beautiful dumplings, with a very cool and lively atmosphere
5
Great food, friendly service (although the couple next to me were kept waiting for a long time), cheap beer. What more can you ask for. Good to see no shark fin based ingredients too.
4
A great place to enjoy good quality food, ice cold Tiger Beer while taking in the atmosphere of Chinatown. We loved the duck, beans and chilli with rice. Our second time here and would definitely return again
5
lovely people and fantastic food
everything we ate was delicious
we went 5 times and hope to go back soon
beef/ chicken and fish dishes fantastic
5
Ate at this restaurant twice in our 3 night stay in Singapore.Service from staff was excellent and food and drink was promptly delivered.Good choice of meals available.
5
Fantastic food, great service, and lovely people working in the restaurant. We were made to feel welcome every time we came here. We can not wait to come back. Thank you China seafood!
4
After spending some time shopping in Chinatown we came across this restaurant. The food was amazing and the cold beers were welcome. The staff were happy and service fast. It was like an oasis during our hot expedition.
1
Very rude and unreliable service staff. Will not come back. There's a reason only foreigners eat there, and no Singaporeans.
2
The only thing good with this place is the location. You can sit and have a beer and watch the tourists in Chinatown. Unfortunately the staff can be quite rude and in your face. During my last visit the waitress very rudely point-blank refused to supply an ice bucket when we ordered two large bottles of Tiger beer on a really hot day. That was enough for me to get up and go to another stall. The clientele is reflective of the service - this place mostly has one-off tourists dining there who probably have little probability of returning for a second tim
4
We had lunch there today. The meal was really good. The only complaints were it was really hot and because they serve crab, they should give wet wipes after the meal. They gave tissues which stuck to everything. Seems like a top spot for tourists. Would definitely return here but this time with my wet wipes
4
Lovely food and a very chill atmosphere. In the middle of China town with decent prices :) chairs are plastic but it's still worth visiting :)
4
Quick service, good food and a nice terrace at this walking streetside restaurant makes it very enjoyable at night. A perfect place to watch people pass by in the heart of Chinatown.
2
But, If yiu decide to take only beer instead of food, you will get extra charge...sad, but life is life...actualy very good location and atmosphere!
3
Food was good, reasonable price. Busy restaurant, waiters are busy and stressed. Dont have time to chat or smile.
Yellow palstic chairs are funny.
Good place but nothing extra.
4
If you want delicious food, then this is the place for you! Yes, it's quite touristy. Yes, it's close to the main areas and so, costs a little more. But darn it, it was delicious!!! The Kung Pao Chicken was one of the bets I've had. The service was friendly, and the atmosphere was chilled and relaxed - great place to hang out and kill an evening!
4
Nice place.. Its right outside the exit of chinatown MRT. The location is right in the midst of the Chinatown hussle bussle. The Chilli crab we ate was small size as per menu,but good enough for both of us. Had also ordered fried rice buns along with it which go well together, overall fantastic chilli crab at $60 or so.Tip: The seating is open air, so get your seat near a fan will be helpful in the hot n humid singapore weather
4
We visited the chinatown seafood restaurant to eat some vegetable springrolls and some plain rice with soy sauce. Both dishes were very good and we only payed 12 SGD (without beverages). But the service could have been friendlier, that's why we would give only 4 points
4
Visited with family including kids. Wide variety of food (including vegetarian) & drinks. Reasonably priced/ very good food but average service - try their variety of steam dumplings if u r calorie conscious.Very busy place though.... seems not enough staff - all the staff seem to be in a rush; they seem more interested in getting more patrons in to the restaurant from the street. Overall, relatively cheap & good food if u can ignore the service
5
We love this restaurant and always end up here when in Singapore. Lots of tasty choices, so you can always have something different every night. It also serves a lot more than just seafood. Beer is cheap and they also mix cocktails. For us we love particularly one waitress who always looks after us and is a lot of fun. Great food, great location and the atmosphere of central Chinatown

This restaurant looks pretty ordinary, has plastic tables and chairs, open air cooled by fans. But it has the best food we have ever had in Singapore, reasonable prices, fast service ( sometimes very fast !) Highly recommend the Peeled Prawns in Cereal. We come here every time we are in Singapor
1
Perfect Location for a tourist trap. Everything overpriced. Quality notbetter than "OK". Go a bit further to the food Street or Hawker Center for much better options.
4
He location is unbeatable if your in china town shopping or sightseeing. The food was fresh and authentic. The beer was cold and reasonable. I highly recommend.
4
Have been walking pass this restaurant for couple of years now and often thought 'why is this place always so busy.' I now know why, the food is superb and surprisingly well priced. Rest assured I'll be back upon my next visit.
4
I had the baby lobsters. The sauce was nice and chilli hot. Service is average. Negative is only one toilet, so during peak times is always busy. Slightly expensive priced. Also had the singapore noodles. Was nice but just average.
5
Nice place to chillin in hot day of singapore.. Great beer and they allow us to smoke.. I really enjoy the ambiance and the food
5
The wait staff are all up beat and happy to welcome you to this great restaurant in a great location. Get off the train at Chinatown station and follow the signs to new bridge road and when you leave the station a few short steps and you're there. The beer is ice cold and wonderful in the heat. We ordered the dim sum selections and they were all wonderful. The owner stopped by for a chat and made us feel very welcome. The food and drinks are well priced and plentifu
1
Beware!!! Hecklers on the street lure you in with the offer of 800g crab for $8. What they charge you is $8 per 100g. Total rip off, many places near by selling the same dish (chilly crab) for a third the price. Food was mediocre and service was under par. Avoid
5
Have eaten here many times. It's so central in Chinatown and the food is great. Try the cereal prawns and the sambal stingray! The green beans with chilli are delicious as a side and there is a generous helping of scallops in the broccoli. Have eaten many of the chicken and pork dishes as well.....it's all good. Everything is served in typically Asian style. Meaning each dish arrives as soon as it's cooked, not all at once. It's placed in the centre for sharing.
3
It's a run down cafe with plastic tables and chairs arranged openly by the street. Good place to sit and people watch, but I've always found the food to only be average despite the massive portions. They do an amazing strawberry milkshake though. Old Chengdu, which is just up the road, is miles better for food.
5
We went there because it closed to our hotel. i was a perfect dinner that we ever had in SG the owner Ms.Lee and her staff Ms.Cheng they are the perfect team ever. We try two difference style of crab "Zesuan" and "Black Pepper" for my opinion they do the better than another restaurant in SG reasonable price best service.We really want to recommend and very easy to get there by mrt China Town St. Gate A and then you will see the restaurant opposite the China Heritage Center.Perfect dinner ever in SG...!!!
5
We stopped here for some Singapore Chili Crab which was magnificent. They also sell cheap beer which is a nice way to wash down the Crab and watch the people go by.
5
Decided to eat here while exploring Chinatown, and what a great decision that was.Got sweet and sour pork with white rice, and I could have happily shared with my wife (who was not there that night) portion sizes are definitely big enough for 2, but I probably would have ordered spring rolls too for two people.Taste was delicious, everything was cooked well, definitely better than I have had in a lot of other Chinese restaurants. Would go back again
4
Myself and five others stumbled across this restaurant while looking for somewhere to have dinner through Chinatown. What a find! Fun, friendly staff cold beer (just what you want on a hot humid night) and the most delicious food. Chilli Crab was so good, along with the chicken curry. Another must try is the French beans with chilli (not sure what they're called). Relaxed vibe with our table on the street. Can't wait to go back :)
5
Well a must do when in Singapore Right in the heart of Chinatown markets is this great eat the chilli mud crab and be bought in three weight sized and then cooked. The crab sauce and other dishes were excellent the tiger beer was kept in ancient key and your glass was never empty with friendly staff always topping it up. Busy little place so good ate different dishes there another night.
4
Located right in Chinatown, great place with sitting inside and outside: pick outside if like people-watch.Pepper crab awesome, other dishes great, all seems good quality and well prepared. Some of the cheapest beer in town in big bottles. We ordered 3 dishes to share: pepper crab, fried beans and a plate of dumplings with 2 big bottles of beer, which came to about 110sgd, which is very good for this. Why not 5 stars? Service was good but was a bit hard to get a hold of waitresses. Otherwise super
3
I had visited this place previously in 2011. We came here to eat simple Chinese food and have couple of Tiger beers. Here the pros and cons.The pros-Singapore fried vermicelli (noodles) were very tasty (10,8 dollars)-Spicy beef with some chilli and lemongrass was also good (16,8 dollars)-Shrimp dumpling were great (10,8 dollars)-Tiger beer prices are good (1 big bottle is below 6 dollars)-Many dishes cost only around 11 dollarsThe cons-Some seafood is quite pricey-Restaurant service is bit hit and miss-Some customers used this as a bar (inexpensive beer attracts price conscious drinkers)Anyway, we got what we wanted. Many dishes are standard Chinese food. 2 persons can eat here for 70 to 90 dollars. And much more if start eating their seafood
4
Had dinner here recently. The position of the restaurant on the corner of a busy intersection means you get to watch a busy, exciting world go past as you dine on some good portioned, flavoursome food. The staff were not overly pushy, service was good and the price reasonable. I'd have no problem recommending this restaurant
4
I went to this restaurant twice when I was in Singapore - definitely for the good food but mainly because of the cheap beer (alcohol is ridiculously expensive in Singapore). The atmosphere is great as it is right in the middle of the markets so lots to see. The service is also good and quick. Definitely recommend checking it out
5
Have been here several times either passing through or staying in Singapore. Great selection of food and a quick turnover keeping things freshly cooked. Excellent Chilli crab. A welcome cold Tiger beer at a very reasonable price of SGD €7.95 for a big bottle. Great place for people watching!
4
1st of cheap beers cheap for Singapore which great really friendly service quick and the chilli crab was so good expensive but not going to send you into debit great location easy to get to buy MRT fun to walk around the area also top of my to go back to list
5
A heap of variety and great food to choose from here. All meals are reasonably priced and portions are ample. Cold, cold Tiger beer washes it all down really well.
4
Stumbled across this while we walking around and glad we did foo was great service prompt nice cold beer and reasonable prices for Singapore.
3
I visit Chinatown just for these dumplings. Try their best Xioa long bao for 6SGD and it's really tasty. Try also the barley drink to refresh your thirst. The place is quite untidy and the tables are not enough for the visitors.
4
I read the reviews and went to try the food. It was nice rich with shrimps and meat, but that's it, nothing special. It was more expensive than the other restaurants in the area. Next time I will try another place.
2
Average food, poor service - payment took more than half an hour. Waiter seized the credit card and I barely managed to get it back.
2
Went with my gf last week. It seems to be a popular place in Singapore's Chinatown. We ordered fried rice with prawns, and sweet and sour pork. The pork was fine, but the rice came with literally 5 prawns for $15 the plate. We ended up spending $53 with only one small beer and a mango smoothie. Just look for other places in Chinatown food street (a couple of blocks away) they are much cheaper and offer the same quality of food.
4
Picked this place because it was busy. Usually a good sign. And the two ladies touting for business did so in a fun and welcoming way - unlike many other touts in the area. Ordered the crispy anchovies, schezuan beans, pork satay sticks, nanya chicken curry and veg spring rolls and rice - for two (was actually enough for three).The anchovies were a good starter, crunchy and flavoursome, not salty as I expected, more like whitebait. The beans were very tasty but the amount of chilli with them would suit only the bravest chilli eater. The curry was the pick for me.Not the cheapest place in Chinatown but a good spot to watch the passing crowd
3
It's all about numbers here and the staff are keen to drag you in and fill one of their many tables.Blatantly for the tourists but the food is surprisingly good considering the volume of customers. Prices are on the high side but you are paying for the location in the centre of Chinatown with its lively atmosphere which you won't find elsewhere. Maybe try it once and then move to a quieter street for something more authentic.
5
My husband was looking for Chili crab and we found it at Chinatown seafood. I had the best fried shrimp I've ever tasted. The atmosphere is casual but clean.We had quick service and loved watching all the action around us. We met the wonderful owner Lee. We will definitely be back to this great restaurant on our next visit to Singapore! Thank you
4
this place is situated on a corner In the heart of china town. they offer great food and good deals on large bottles of tiger beer . very relaxing place to kill a few hours just watching the world go by .service is very fast and I must say have enjoyed quality food there on every occasion, We are regulars in Singapore for the F1 and always end up joining tables with other people from around the world who are also in town for the F1 . there are so many places to enjoy local cuisine as in hawkers and restaurants wich we do but this place offers an exciting atmosphere for the short term tourist
4
In General you have a lot of good food in Singapore one of the Please is this place that give you good food for not high prices and you can eat almost all.
5
Do yourself a favour.
It is obvious why this place is always busy.
Get in there and fill your boots. You won't be sorry.
A great meal and wonderful perch for people-spotting too.
5
I enjoyed my meal of Cereal Prawns and a cold lemon tea. Place was busy but service kept pace. Lots of choices & everything I observed on other diners' plates looked great.
5
Had the best Chilli Crab here. No finesse dining here only finesse cooking. Very warm night, however the cold Tiger Beer definitely helped.
4
Singapore chilli crab was very tasty.
Good service. Busy place. Crab was $60/kg. Ours was $48. I would go back
2
We ordered the chilli crab, shezuan chicken and seafood fried rice, our bill was over $100! The chilli crab was nice but not worth it whilst the other two dishes were very average. The service was very poor as well.
4
Set in the middle of the chinatown tourist market area, this place is great for people watching and the Tiger beer at around $10 for a large bottle is reasonable. the service is friendly and the food is pretty good too.
3
I did order Chilli crab after the review and the taste is so good even it quite hard to eat. The Crab fried rice & Roast duck are taste alright but not special. I also ordered sambal kangkong which taste very plain not recommended. Be aware of the price shown on the menu there are not inc. 10% service & 7% GST.
4
Have been coming to this restaurant for years - every time we come to Singapore we pop in for icy cold bintangs and great people watching. The black and pepper crab here is great but the prices are certainly higher than they were on my first visit (14 years ago) so pop in here for beer and then head to the hawker markets for cheap foo
1
My partner and I went into the restaurant planning to order lunch. It was very hot and humid so we requested a table where we would have some breeze from the fans to cool down a bit, The waitress sat us at a table in the middle of the restaurant where there was no airflow from the fans and when we requested another table she refused us and told us if we didn't want that table then we should leave - so we did. There were hardly any other customers and plenty of other tables available at the time. The waitress was very rude when talking to us, Maybe she had a bad day but I certainly won't be going back
1
Not only was it a long wait for the 2 Singapore Sling Cocktails, they forgot to bring the glass of wine we ordered. They were apologetic. I don't understand why the service was slow, the place was not crowded
5
We chose this place because it was busy and I'm glad we did. The meal was unreal and so was the service. The waiters were great and it was not expensive.
5
We've been twice to this restaurant. It's very reasonable and in a good location in Chinatown. Don't miss a visit to the nearby Buddha Tooth Relic Temple.
1
Stopped here for 2 Singapore slings and a glass of wine. We received the slings about 20 min after ordering. Never got the wine! Piss poor service. Skip it. Many other places to visit. The only way they would bring the bill is when I stood with my purse on my shoulder. Oh that made em come over to us real quick.....they wanted their money. Dummie
4
Don't expect service with a smile, but do expect good food. The waitresses were quite dismissive, plonked plates on tables without even looking a bad barked 'what you want?!' However the food was hot, delicious and reasonably priced. Don't forget that tax and service needs to be added to the advertised price in Singapore.
5
We ate here several times during our 2 weeks in Singapore. Good food, fun place. Our waitress ran around like crazy and kept us laughing all night. The only down side was when we came back and were only 2, they pretty much ignored us. Totally different then when we were here as a group. But the food was always good
3
We had lunch here and although the food was yummy and the prices really inexpensive, the staff was really not paying attention or providing a good service. I doubt they even spoke english. We asked twice for the restaurant WiFi password just to be ignored. They even forgot to return my credit card when I paid
5
Situated halfway along Pagoda Street this is a great place to eat or just have a beer and watch the world go by. We particularly like the Crocodile tail with ginger and spring onions and the Honey glazed pork. Whenever we come to Singapore this is always our first stop
5
I visited this place many times for social and business gatherings and have never been disappointed, the menu choice is good (meat, fish and rice dishes) the prices are good (but not as cheap as a hawker), the beer is well priced (at hawker price of $7.95 per large Tiger), but the location, smack bang in the middle of China town us the best. Good for social or business dinner.
5
Taken here by a friend and resident of Singapore during a recent visit. He wanted me to experience the real feeling of Singapore and of a busy day in Chinatown. I read a little about this restaurant and was looking forward to the food. Looks are deceiving. If you're into Michelin 3 star bistros and glamour this is not the place for you. It is authentic and awesome food that makes no pretense about being fancy. Also, it is always busy. If you need constant attention likely best to stay away. Go because you want some awesome Chinese seafood. The chilli crab is spectacular. Shrimp and all fish are wonderful. Soups are great. Beer is cold and the coffee is good. Go to eat. Enjoy the surroundings.
4
Had lunch here. All the bustle of a street restaurant with good food, cold beer and wine at reasonable prices. Well worth visiting if you are in Chinatown.
5
This restaurant is great! We had the most amazing chilli crab served to us. The price was good, the drinks were chilled, and the service was good.
It's a must visit when you are in Chinatown!!!
5
Everytime we are in Singapore we always head here for eats and drinks. Best place. Always busy. Great service. Cold beer. Yummy food. Fantastic place to relax and just chill out and people watch.
1
The worst lobster I have ever tried like made of rubber. The spicy chicken was not the best either. However they had a good cold beer. I will not visit them again.
5
Had a great meal, at really good price. Good for young travellers wanting a nice experience. Drinks are good prices $8 630ml tiger beers as of today. Good place for a easy dinner.
4
The large bottles of Tiger Beer (633ml) are the only drink you need here, add some Honey Pork, sit back and enjoy the heat. Just watch the world go by.
4
We had the Chilli Crab on advice from someone else who has had it previously. It was fun, although messy, and tasted great. The market price of crabs around Singapore is fairly high so that was a drawback. The restaurant forgot about one of our meals but delivered it later without us having to inquire about it. Understandable in such a busy place! A good experience overall.
5
Tried crab dishes in the USA, Russia, Mauritius and Hong Kong but here a huge mud chili crab is the best for those who don't mind using hands to eat it. For me usual mess just means washing my hands afterwards but after 2 bottles of beer visiting a bathroom is mandatory, I believe
4
After almost 3 days in singapore and having no such luck in finding anything nice to eat, me and my boyfriend finaly stumbled into this place while in chinatown looking for dinner. And damn its good. Finished all of it without a single complaint (which is very hard for me when it comes to food)
4
Great place to people watch since it's right on the corner of Pagoda St and Trengganu St right after you exit the Chinatown MRT station. We were looking for unusual food, and found it here. What's even better, they had nice cold bottles of Tiger beer! My husband had to try the chicken feet, and he said they were a lot like buffalo wings back in the States... but they weren't deep fried. Great respite from the heat and rain while shopping amongst the Chinese New Year crowds
5
Sit with an ice cold beer and watch the world pass by, great atmosphere great food brilliant staff , we have been 14 years in a row to Singapore and it would not be the same without 3-4 nights here
5
If you want to have the deal in flavour you need to try this restaurant in Chinatown. Good service, good servings and great flavours. Good selection of food and drinks. Reasonable price.
4
The staff were attentive, have been a number of times whilst in singapore, lovely food and good prices!
5
We went to this restaurant 2 times on our stay in Singapore. This is a very busy restaurant with a very large menu. Although it says seafood restaurant there are many other non seafood food options to choose from. Large Tiger Beers around SGD.8 is a very good deal. The food is prepared fresh and comes to the table piping hot. On the first night for some reason the pork dish never got to us until we finished the meal after reminding them several times. We decided not to take it on arrival, no fuss, just lots of apologies. My partner wanted to go back on the second night and they were so happy to see us. Both ladies fussed over us and looked after us and told us they thought we would never go back after the previous night. For such a busy restaurant to remember and care is wonderful. We will certainly go back on our next trip to Singapore
4
My friends suggested a dinner in Chinatown and they selected this really fun spot that also had great food. The Chili Crab are great along with the pork or crab dumplings. With the crowded street with shoppers and the Saturday evening fireworks that precedng Chinese New Year made for an interesting and enjoyable evenin
5
Hot day in china town with boys who were nervous about eating anywhere Chinese. Tiger beers really good price at $SG 8, we had a few and relaxed. Toilets very clean !!!. We had spring rolls, kebabs and sweet and sour pork and fried rice all very good. Watch the world go by here
4
The dumplings with hot chili oil will change your plans for the rest of the day. The menu is extensive and its open late, a great place to snack and people watch. Also, they have the Tiger beer girls on staff, who's sole job is to make sure your ice cold tiger beer is topped off
4
We have done Singapore a number of times. Had to pick a venue for last day lunch with friends. I used trip advisor. Mostly good reviews so gave it a go. Fantastic!!!! Right in the heart of it. We had lunch. Hot day but fans in open restaurant. Food fantastic. Every dish. Chilli crab fantastic. Prawns, rice, spring rolls, etc. we had about 10 dishes all up. All fantastic. Drinks including wine list rest and reasonable prices. We have eaten at all types of restaurants in Singapore. High end and local. This is a great choice. Do it.
3
The food was great no doubt a must try is the Singaporian crab in chilli sauce. It was indeed a tantalising experience. However, the downfall was the poor and slow service and sometimes out of stock on certain food items even though they know its peak season was disappointing. I found some staff members to be slightly racist towards us and attended to customers that were seated to after us
4
Chanced upon this restaurant waling through Chinatown. Aimed to attract the tourist dollar and doesn't disappoint. Big serves, cold beer, efficient service and very effective all round experience. I am sure there are plenty of tourist experiences in Singapore but this is one of my best
5
Excellent Food and beer for a very good price. Very clean place. The staff was very friendly. Everything we ate was so good Dumplings spring rolls and The veggies
5
We love to just sit here - drink a big Tiger Beer, eat some great food & people watch in Chinatown. Our favourite Chinatown place to eat.
4
Been here a number of times and the food is still the best priced local food around in a tourist zone. The staff are attentive, although working a large number of tables, still attentive. The coldest of beers and great people watching!
1
Very poor impersonal service. Have to ask 5 + times to get service. Food not worth half of what's paid.
3
Like many others we stopped to look at the menu and were quickly chatted up by the hostess. She was such a personality we decided not to bother looking for other dinner options.As recommended by the hostess we sat at the front under cover in case of rain, and under a fan.Dim sum took quite a long time to arrive but were reasonable. Beer and sprite were cold and a great accompaniment to watching people (mostly tourists but a few locals) stroll by and the hostess efficiently fill the restaurant by 7.30pm Reasonable prices.Recommended for a relaxing meal
1
My wife and I stopped here for lunch whilst visiting Chinatown. We paid SGD61 for 3 dishes, a beer and a water, which is massively overpriced for food in a market. The meal sizes were OK, but the flavour was basic and seemed westernised rather than taking on anything that resembled Chinese flavours. To make things worse, each dish was served about 10-15 mins apart, which meant that we could not eat our meals together (my wife is allergic to wheat and could not eat the Szechuan chicken) nor combine the different plates. Service was average at best...took me 3 or 4 attempts to grab the attention of the service staff to order food. I would not return here, nor recommend it to anyone else.
5
This is an amazing place.The food and service are incredible. The flavours are everything you want and would except from a menu like this.There is nothing fancy about the place, but you will not find a better place for a meal in Signapore. The chilli crab is great, and you should wear the apron This is not fine dining but is definitely exceptional dining My friends took me here and boosted for ages about it and was well impressed would go back every night
3
We wanted to try the Chilli crab, Singapore's national dish and didn't know what to expect. We shared a medium crab and chilli beans. The meal was extremely messy to eat, you pay extra for the wet wipe towels. The dish was tasty but for the amount of money you pay you get a minimal amount of crab meat. We had two mango smoothies each with our shared meal with rice and it came to $93 SING. We are glad to have tried it but wouldn't bother again. Good service, we noticed other restaurants provided a plastic glove to eat the chilli crab with which looked like a good idea.
5
First off this place does way more than just seafood. It was that good we visited twice in the same day. Superb from start to finish both times. We had an early evening dinner with a few tigers before shopping, and before we headed back to the MRT we had another snack with more tigers!!!!! Heaven!
2
Although the food was great the service was slow and the waitress bought out or vegetable dish first then the rice was 10 mins later and then our prawn dish came out last when we were almost finished our entire meal. Plus we almost got charged for extra beer which we had never ordered . I would be careful eating here agai
4
Great setting in the centre of old Chinatown,switched on staff know when you need another beer almost before you do. Good food ,just a fantastic place to eat , drink and people watch, reasonable prices
4
There's so many places to choose from in Chinatown but this is worth a stop. As an added bonus - its easy to find - just walk straight out of entrance A of Chinatown MRT and its on the first corner you come to.
5
They really know what they're doing at this place! Attentive service, tasty food, ice cold beer. Good move advertising the trip advisor certificate of excellence, it's the reason we ate here.
5
Walking through China town in Singapore can be very long and exhausting, so a stop at the china town seafood restaurant is a must! The food is served quick and is really nice, beer is cheap and cold, what else do you need?
4
Great place to discover Singapore's local chili crab. Fair price, good situation and nice staff. The beers are good price too.
2
Over visiting our daughter and had been here numerous times previously.I had no problems before as service,food and drink were excellent.However,3 days ago two young Indian lads (Christians) sat beside me...could not have been more mannerable but yet were berated by a waitress(so disappointing and a shock for me).I gave place a body swerve for couple of days and today went again to meet my wife,daughter and grandson.Good service and friendly and we we met a young couple with a lovely son ,nearly two years old.We had a nice time and near the end of our stay(between two couples we spent $200...not that it matters) the young boy splashed water from the ice bucket on to the table(minimal).The attitude of the waitress then was awful and over the top.I complained and was ignored.We walked away but one thing sure ,tomorrow when it opens,I will let them know how disappointing it was
4
Ate here a couple of times during our stay Dim sum is excellent for a lunchtime snack large beers only $6.95 and wonderfully cold!Staff are very friendly and nothing is too much trouble Fans help cool you down and you can just and watch the world go by!!
1
I was with my friend strolling around in Chinatown. We decided to have a break and some beer at this eatery amid Chinatown. We were offered a table and we sat down and ordered beer. A waitress subsequently came and asked if we would like to order some food, but we declined because we have had our dinner. She then told us that we had to shift to another table because we did not order any food, so can't occupy the table which was offered to us. Now, we are Singaporeans and this is my first time being asked to vacate from a table because we had ordered beer but not food?!! If they can do his to a Singaporean, I can't imagine how they would do likewise to tourists. The way they are doing this business is totally unprofessional and would tarnish the image of Singapore. I would not want to go back there again.
5
While strolling through Chinatown and keeping an eye open for a good authentic Chinese restaurant with my wife, we came upon this great little place. We noticed the tripadvisor certificate of excellence out front and just had to try it out. We were 1st greeted by a nice, friendly lady who showed us to our table and another server came and asked if we'd like some beer. We ordered a Tiger beer each and it was nice and cold. We ordered some shrimp and rice,,,,it was quickly served up to us and the taste was delicious! Just spicey enough to give it the right amount of kick but not over done and the rice was not the sticky kind which was really nice. Great service, extra tasty food and cold beer, we were very pleased
1
Had the dish with beef and additional rice. Recieved a bowl with more bone then meat. When it wasn't bone, it was the fat of the meat. Chewing on rubber. My friends dish, dumpling soup, had no taste at all. Just a bowl of hot water with a slight taste of bouilion with a few lost dumplings.When asked for the bill, we had to wait more then 10 min. for the change. Wouldn't tip even 0,01 Ringgit
3
Local Chinese restaurant located at the middle of Chinatown. They serve a verity of Chinese food. We had a quick meal of dim sum that were fresh and delicious with a local beer.
Good and pleasant service. Quite cheap
Recommend (!)
4
Enjoyed our lunch here while visiting Chinatown. Staff attentive, food very good and well priced though there is a service charge. Nice place to sit and people watch.
4
Delicious food and verr good professional, quick service. The only yhing I didn't like that the crab wasn't "opened" so I gad to do it and that made me less joyfull... and the prawns tgey prepare unpealed so that wasn't enjoyable at all.
4
We are having great food, clearly fresh products and the staff is entertaining our son, so we can eat in peace. They are so kind to him (1.5 yrs), like nurses, amazing, haha! Entertaing for parents as well.
1
Wouldn't recommend the place.
Choose one of the many other restaurants i Chinatown instead.
This place is a tourist trap.
4
This is the place to eat if you want tasty produce and friendly staff in a genuine place. Tasty prawns, fish, crabs. Good "Tiger beer". And at a decent price
5
Great location in Chinatown, great people watching while eating! Friendly staff! I ordered the Chilli Crab and loved it! Amazing taste and so messy! You are given and apron to wear. Recommend a visit.
4
We stumbled across this place a few years ago but visit on return visits to Singapore. Beers are cold, food is great and reasonable price as it is right in the middle of tourists. Atmosphere is great as always busy....
5
Best chilicrab i have tried in Singapore so far. Always going back Prices are reasonable and staff are friendly. They even offer you a apron to avoid the messy crab falling on your cloths. Not recommended for anyone looking for a grate ambiance as the place looks more like a hawker center in middle of the crowded china town. But the food is heavenly!!!!
4
I travelled to Singapore specifically wanting some famous Singaporean Chilli Crab! I had my first tasting of it here at Chinatown Seafood Restaurant as we didn't want to travel too far from our hotel and hassle with any bookings.The staff here to me were friendly and attentive to us and the surround tables around us. It was a busy joint, most tables were occupied with tourists from all around. The food, some of the dishes were a hit or miss. But this was definitely on the few places that did a well priced Chilli Crab compared to other restaurants around Singapore. The crocodile dish wasn't very good the meat was dry and tough, I've had better crocodile. The Chilli Crab was good! Order a side of steamed buns so you can dip them into the chilli crab sauce!! YUM. I'll be back for more next time i'm in Chinatown in Singapore :
1
Had a meal which was unappetizing and quite tasteless, I asked for a refund and the server became agitated and aggressive,eventually paid for uneaten meal.
4
Great place to eat in Chinatown in Singapore, busy location on the corner just outside the Chinatown underground stop. Good menu and food, good service and food prices, easy to recommend
5
I had prawn migoreng and it was bloody lovely. Our group of 11 had loads of other thing and everyone loved it.
Highly recommended
5
A good spot to rest the feet, sit under a fan and enjoy a cold beer. When they say it is cold they mean cold. Also enjoyed some spring rolls and satay as a snack which both were good.
3
The restaurant is ok and serves good food. Of course it is located in a very touristic area of Singapore, so prepare to seat mostly next to tourists...
3
Quite a good selection of food and drinks. Prices reasonable for Chinatown. Quick service and clean amenities. Food sizes as depicted on the menu and what you actually get are two different things. Okay for lunch or dinner.
5
Great food lovely staff always look after use when we visit for food and drink keep up the good work micheal james @ mark faghy
4
Great for snacks and cold beer. Very convenient location. Great for lunch light bites or full dinner. Fried rice dishes are superb. Recommended.

I like everything I've had here, but my favorite is the Egg Yolk Shrimp. They are delectable. Many people rave about the Chili Crab too. The Fried Rice is also excellent. I recommend eating here.

The food is nothing like the picture card that you have to choose from. I was brought the wrong food at first. When the correct order came it was dreadful, it was supposed to be prawn and pork balls but tasted of nothing. Little surprise that they serve it sweet chilli sauce they have to inject flavour somewhere. When I told the waitress it was awful she became very aggressive, told me that I had eaten most of it (I had tried two and a half balls out of 12 balls). We also saw an argument with another customer and although we could not understand what was being said the waitress recorded it on her mobile. If I could give this place a zero I would

Nice food but not super amazing.....the cold beer was a welcome drink!!!
Wasn't that cheap for what it was!!!
4
We come to this restaurant regularly because it is in the middle of Chinatown and therefore very convenient. The food is good, the beer cheap and you can watch the people walk by as you relax from all of your shopping.
5
Friendly smiling staff, clean and quick service. Cold beers and excellent food. We had the best meal of our stay at this lovely walk in hawker style street restaurant in China Town.
4
Wanr to eat Chili Crab with a affordable price? Then don't go to Jumbo Seafood or No Signboard, go to Chinatown Seafood Restaurant. Only 6$ per 100g, and no need to queue to be served
5
We tried both the national dish, chilli crab, and the salted egg yolk crab. Both were delicious and full of meat. The lemon tea was nice to finish it off. Thumbs up.Ps. The price exclude service charge, gst and wet towel fee so be aware
5
We ate here when we last travelled to singapore 2 years ago and had to go back this trip. Restaurant is not much to look at as you walk by but the food is delicious. We ordered 3 dishes and were happy with the portion sizes and the drink selection. Would recommend this restauran
2
We usually eat here a couple of times when we visit Singapore, on this occasion our meal was very disappointing. The food was tasteless, the service was OK the price seemed higher for the type of establishment which is one up from the hawker centres such as Maxwells. They push the bottled beer and top you up to make you order more quickly. Don't honk it will get a second visit from us on his holiday.

An oasis in the middle of the busy Chinatown tourist strip. What better than a young pretty waitress suggesting a nice cold Tiger Beer and a seat at this well positioned restaurant, especially on a hot and balmy day. Why not, and why not try the cuisene at the same time. Had the honey satay chicken, yum yum. The mango smoothie was delicious and the beer was indeed cold and welcoming. Had a great time people watching and relaxing and good to get out of the stream of the many tourists walking past. Worth every cent (not that it was expensive). Will certainly come back for the chilli crab next time. Thanks girls

My partner and I visited Chinatown Seafood Restaurant after reading the glowing reviews on Tripadvisor. We had heard about all of the most popular seafood restaurants for chilli crab (Jumbo, no-signboard etc), but did not want to pay too much. Also this was very close to our hotel, so a great, easily accessible location. We had the chilli crab here (with a side of fried mantou) and it was amazing!! It cost around $80 for everything (800g crab + spring rolls + two drinks + mantou + service charge + gst + wet napkins lol). They also give you a bib if you order crab so you do not get sauce all over yourself (and definitely use if when they give it to you - everyone else does so don't worry about looking stupid lol! We got sauce all over the bib... Oops haha)The service was quite friendly and very prompt! They did not try to sell you extra things or complain if you did not order as much as the table next to you. They also served with a smile! I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone who wants to try many of the famous Singaporean seafood dishes, especially chilli crab (black pepper crab, and salted egg-yolk crab)
5
This on the street restaurant stall off of pagoda Street reminds me of a Kowloon night market, but don't let the Chinatown atmosphere fool you. If you are looking for a fantastically tasty, sweet and spicy, just enough to make you wonder if the sweat on your brow was from the food or the humidity, this is it. Large crabs, loads of crab in the sauce so order the buns for mop up duty, you won't want to leave a drop. Industrial bibs provided. Jumbo crabs without the "Jumbo" price. Then you can walk it and the couple of beers that mysteriously kept appearing off by buying trinkets, "authentic" souvenirs in a traditional Chinese street market.Lots of other great crab and seafood offerings, but I'm partial to the Chilli Crab.Go have a nice walk on Clarke Wuay, work up an appetite and then save about 30% and eat at Chinatown Seafood Restauran
4
We went here twice, it's fast, efficient, and fun. The beer is cold and food is great. Prices are a little more than the hawker food stalls, but the food is excellent. Try the ginger clams and chilli crab.
4
Very good location with corner outside seating,quickly service,very focused to tourist of course,but really very good variety of meals!
3
A wide variety of food on the menu, but it is expensive compared with most eateries in Chinatown. Especially compared with Smith St. Their prices seem to have doubled in the past 2 years since they took over the adjacent restaurant.
4
Surprisingly the restaurant has managed to offer really good seafood in a busy tourist area. The Chilli Crabs were fantastic and so was the spicy fried kangkong.
The beers were cold and it's a good stop in the middle of shopping in Chinatown.
5
This is my MUST DO with every visit to SIngapore. Bamboo Clams, Chilli or Black Pepper Crab, deep Fried Baby Squid (best with the Ice Cold Tiger Beer served here) and Kangkong Sambal Belachan (Water Spinach cooked in a blend of Chilli & shrimp paste).MMMMMMMM....YUMMMMMM!People watching - - best accompanimen
5
A trip to Singapore would not be complete without a visit.My wife had the Chili Crab (we shared) and my favourite; the Hong Kong style steamed fresh bass steamed in ginger and soy sauce.Service was great, a couple of large Tiger beers to wash it down. A singapore crab could easily feed two , add other dishes for a feast.A word of caution if you have old dental work... watch the crab shells ! The provision of a special bib is a must.. ENJOY this place it is tailored for a tourist experience and never every dissapoints
5
Singaporean Chilly or Pepper Crab can be found at various locations from Clarke Quay to East Coast and even at Newton Circus but none to beat the value you get here at the China Town Seafood Restaurant.The only downside here is non AC and the Singapore weather can get to you.
4
We had noodles, rice and vegetables. All were well cooked and the price is fairly good as well. The service was just OK and they kind of threw the food down when it was ready but that is normal in places like this, and you are really just here for good food anyway. Would come back again
4
I think I have stopped and had a beer here (large bottle of Tiger approx SGD 7) every time I go to Chinatown. Typically it rains when I go to Chinatown, so sitting under the canopy with a beer and watching people go by (they brought umbrellas) is a nice way to wait out the weather.The food is good. If we go there to eat, usually we get sweet & sour pork and black pepper crab. The crab is expensive; not as expensive as in Clarke Quay, of course, but much more expensive than in Little Thailand
4
This place is easy to find - look for the yellow chairs! Reasonably priced Chinese right in the heart of China Town. The food was great, and the beer was icy cold (even had it's own ice bucket). The beer waitresses were very attentive and never let our glasses empty
4
Food was great, good choice and well prepared. Good service, but watch out for the drinks - I'm sure that's where they make their profits!
5
We ate chilli crab and panko prawns both were excellent dishes.Would definitely recommend this restaurant.
4
Have dined here on multiple occasions & the service is always fast, friendly with delicious food & cold beer!
3
overrated. This is a restaurant that goes for the tourists. The portiosn are huge, but not very tasty.They are fast, but too expensive and service and tax is still addes afterwards. You can do better elsewhere.
5
Seeing all the locals eat there gave it away... it had to be good. More like fantastic. Very fast and friendly service. food was delicious. Not to mention a great price for a Singapore eatery. Worth going to if seafood is your passion. Highly recommend.
4
Nice food and fair prices, have tiger beer! Great noodles and ample selection of seafood.
Nice stop for a mid day trip to chinatown.
5
Enjoyed 3 meals here whilst in Singapore. Try the Beef with chilli and Lemon grass and all the seafood is excellent. Order steamed rice at only $1 which is not on the menu rather than fried.
5
Everything we had here was EXCELLENT. Enormous crab available and salted egg yolk crab was phenomenal. ZERO wait on the eve of one of Singapore's biggest holidays; save yourself 4 hour's waiting for other restaurants and walk into Chinatown. Beer and wine prices the best in town
5
Each time we walked past this place was full - but we eventually got a table on a Saturday night- I had been hanging for the Singapore chilli crab so decided to eat one- They could not believe that it was just for me - and my wife would order her own meal - they tried to talk us out of some of the dishes as they said it would be too much - there expertise was greatly appreciated.The chilli crab was how I remembered it last time I was in Singapore - tasty , succulent, and very messy - Good job they gave me a Bib -! I also ordered Singapore noodles with it as well as spring rolls whilst my wife ordered Beef in Ginger and garlic and Egg fried rice and spring rolls .With several large Tiger beers - this was a most enjoyable meal- eating and watching the world go by and this place has got a real buzz about it - terrific atmosphere- Staff were really friendly , service was good and prices are what you expect to pay for seafood - market price - Always ask first though - In fact we looked at three other restaurants who wanted to charge between $60 and $75 for the crab - My crab was S$48 for 800 gsm - and it was a great meal- If the prices put you off- Ask yourself - when will you be back in SIngapore again? Splash out and spend and have a memorable evening 
5
I visited this place two times due to their tasty food and I would vouch for it. The portions are huge and so one order will easily serve two people. First day I ordered spicy fried rice and some chicken with 1 lobster. Second day I ordered crocodile meat and fried rice and one crab. Of course Tiger beer was there. The lady who served us on both the days was very helpful and courteous. All you need to do is select the item on the menu and tell them the number. Once again one portion could be easily served for two person. The food is so tasty that you would really remember it. This is one place i would recommend to anyone who would visit China Tow
5
Great satay and noodles in a clean and comfortable environment. They happily made us some non spicy food for the kids. Cheers.
4
Amazing seafood! restaurant basic but super clean and food is delicious. Waitress was a little unfriendly (by singapore standards - we found everyone to be super helpful and friendly in general in Singapore) non the less we had a great meal!
5
The food was very good, excellent taste, temperature and service. The place is kinda crowded, but we got our meal really fast.
4
Looking for somewhere in Chinatown where wine by glass wasn't a rip off - found this place with wine at SGD7 which was much better than between SGD11 - 14 a glass! Beer prices also very good with iced mugs and cold beer, quick service apart from wine which seemed to take forever to come. Meals were good with generous tasty serves.Overall would recommend
5
This is officially my favourite thing to do in Singapore. This restaurant is no frills excellence. Whenever we come to Singapore, we come here for chili crab and bear, and I am not even a beer drinker!A great place to sit, eat and people watch
3
We had a fun a messy Singapore Chilly Crab experience. This is a basic street food venue with plastic chairs and tables. Service is basic and smiles not apparent. Chilly Crab was very good and extremely messy. Good place to come for cold beer, crab and atmosphere of Chinatown
4
We were having a wander round Chinatown and every time we passsed this place, it was very busy,with locals and tourists alike.The hostess kept asking us to go in but in a good-humoured, not pushy, way. We eventually got a bit peckish so decided to have something to eat and headed back to this place. The hostess remembered us and was so happy that she could find us a table! We opted for sticky-honey spareribs to share and then both picked a main course with pineapple fried rice as an accompaniment.The waitress started waving her hands about and said "Too much, too much!" so we just picked a sort of Malaysian beef dish to share between us with the rice. She was right though, as we saw when the food arrived, and we were very grateful to her for warning us as in many places they wouldn't have bothered. The food was delicious and we loved it. Costwise, it probably wasn't much cheaper than we're used to paying at home but of course, I had a cocktail to drink with my meal (just felt likeit!!) and my husband had a large beer. It was extremely busy all the time we were there but service was friendly and efficient. Would definitely go back
5
Just arrived in Singapore. We tried this restaurant and we loved it. They're chili crab is amazing. The 800gr plus two other side dishes was enough for us. I didn't expect, but even the other dishes (some rice and spicy vegetables) were really good. We'll come back one of these days, after trying other restaurants in town.
2
We ordered three different dishes. It was beef, pork with sweet and sour sauce and chicken sezuan sauce. The pork was ok. The rest of the food on this pricy place was not good at all. But the waiters was still smiling and the beer was cheap
4
We left the tube station and walked for a couple of steps and reached the restaurant. We saw the Tripadvisor's badge in the restaurant and decided to try out the food. A friendly staff recommended a few popular local dishes for us. We were going to try the curried crabs but the portion was way too much for two to share so we did not order it. We had the Hainanese chicken and rice plus meat broth of ribs which were lovely.We did enjoy the food and the friendly service too!For drinks we ordered some cold drinks: lime and lemon which were kind of refreshing
5
The place mainly caters to tourists. The pepper crab was awesome. It was piping hot and cooked right with the right amount of spices.
4
The Chili Crab was on par with Jumbo Seafood in my opinion and the cold tall Tiger beers were very reasonable.
4
Don't pay an arm and a leg for chilli crab in Singapore. Chinatown Seafood Restaurant does this local delicacy justice and staff are attentive, cheerful and helpful.
4
Just down the alley from the Chinatown MRT station, or, as we did, an easy walk from the downtown area.The service is friendly and speedy, the food very tasty, the Tiger beer cold, the setting relaxed.In our case, the four of us enjoyed a couple of beers and some yummy food, our partners went off shopping, and we sat and watched the world go by.I last visited this place a couple of years back, and it's not changed. A good thing
4
Good location in the middle of Chinatown. Excellent service - the waitstaff are on the ball here. The menu is extensive. We had some very nice king prawn fritters with chilli sauce. We normally don't go for anything "fritters" but saw our table neighbours receive some. so we decided to try. They were beautiful. This restaurant is also a very nice waterhole - cheap beer after a long walk - watch the crowd walk by. We'll be back.Cheers Niels & Mary, Humpty Doo, NT, Australia, Down Unde
4
Eat before or after but whenever you must stop and have a meal at this well know restaurant in Chinatown. I also wonder if it is the place you people watch from. I think putting it in simply terms it is not fancy but typical Chinese. Very tasty and finger licking goo
3
You pay for a dedicated table, a waitress and the ceiling fans. The food is nice but fairly mild. The basic noodle and rice dishes are 2-3 times the price of the carts around the corner in eat street. If you don't mind the table search and the wait at each cart for your meal, you can get high quality food in Eat Street for much less outlay
5
My family have dined here many times... It's not fancy but it's delicious! Battered prawns, fried rice, sweet & sour pork, chilli crab - fantastic! The beer was cold, the ceiling fans kept us cool and the staff are super friendly. The restaurant provided a high chair for our baby. A great meal in the middle of the markets
5
I was a bit concerned that there were no locals here, however the food was brilliant, all very fresh. then i realized why there's no locals its fairly pricey for the standards there. Theres a hauker market (loads of food stalls in a confined area) very close by that has similar food but the atmosphere and location here is great. So if you pass it i would suggest just grabbing a table
2
....when a shop has a majority of white tourists, it's screaming tourists trap! I mean no disrespect to white folks absolutely, because unethical businesses do target you... Ended up arguing with my English friend who insisted on eating here... Fine, I gave in... let's see the menu... Excuse me... S$11.80 for a simple fried noodle?! We pay about S$5.00.... and WHAT?! S$4.80 for a lousy iced coffee? Hello, $2.00 is already a rip off... Wait, did I just see cocktails?? What cocktails?! We absolutely DO NOT do cocktails in a Kopitiam (coffeeshop)! Unless you enjoy being rip off, and still get an inauthentic Kopitiam experience... Doesn't seem right to me no matter which way you slice it... Really... it's so bad that I consider it a disgrace to be caught eating here by local friends... can almost hear them saying, "Hey you stupid or what?!" at me... Seriously, go somewhere else. Most Kopitiams have an English menu and staff who can speak basic English anyway..
1
was asked to shift table 3 times while having meals with hungry children, and waitress refuse to check if the remaining were ready to be served
no more visit to this restaurant!
5
We ordered clams and lobsters with chilly, they were so fresh, delicious and spicy! The portion was also generous/big.
4
The Fried rice variants were very tasty and some nice and spicey. Beers especially Tiger very reasonable at S$6.95 per large bottle.
5
Reasonable priced seafood. If You do not need a fancy decoration, air condition and table cloths this is the right place to enjoy good seafood and watch people passing by.
5
Great choice of food and good prices. Staff are prompt in serving but a little officious. We have eaten there several times and always have a great experience ... It is always extremely busy, but you are in and out fairly quickly
5
We were recommended to this restaurant for the best chilli crab and tiger beer mmmmmm delicious.
This was the first time I had tried it and it was beautiful. My husband doesn't like seafood so he had a big serve of spring rolls.
4
Thought he idea of it being in the middle of China town is appealing, service is also fast, but food was not very good. Tables were full, and as is in any street restaurant, they are very near to each other. We wanted to have authentic Singaporean Chilly crab, but it was a little too sweet. Starters were good, not very good.
4
This is not a high-end establishment, but the food is great and the service fast and efficient. It's so big that you get the impression of a canteen, and choose your seat carefully if you don't want to see the lobsters and other creatures being hauled out of their tanks to grace your plate
5
After great (and i do mean great) souvenir shipping in Chinatown, we stopped at Chinatown Seafood and OMG, it was AWESOME!!! Very reasonable prices, great food, nice people watcher spot and the Chilli Crab was to die for!!!Do yourself a flavor...go to Chinatown Seafood when in Singapore!!
4
This restaurant has a prime position on a corner in the heart of Chinatown, and being open-sided means that most tables provide a good and interesting vantage point for watching the people wander by and poke about in the shops opposite. It has a mixed clientele of local Chinese, locally domiciled ex-pats and tourists. Although it’s predominantly a restaurant you can happily sit with a beer or two without eating. I should take up the point of the beer prices as I see that several earlier reviews have commented on the cheap beer and even quoted a price of S$6.50 for a large Tiger beer. This is not quite accurate. A prominent notice does advertise a large Tiger beer at the very attractive price of S$6.95, but this price does not include a 10% service charge or the 7% GST tax. Therefore the total cost is over $8 – still cheaper than most places but not quite as cheap as some reviews imply (you can get a similarly large cold bottle of Tiger for S$8 at the end of nearby Smith Street). While on the subject of beer, if you order two (or more) bottles they are served in a bucket of ice which keeps them refreshingly cold.We found the food to be invariably good (the prawns in oatmeal are delicious), so together with the ambience, reasonably priced cold beer, the enjoyment of people-watching, and general vibrant atmosphere of the area this restaurant is a must each time we visit Singapore
4
Street dining or hawker food can be somewhat adventurous for Europeans. But we really enjoyed our evening meal here. Food was fine. Beer cheap and cold. Staff friendly and very attentive. Prices very reasonable. Great fun watching the world go by on busy Pagoda Street.
2
I've eaten here twice and both times I wasn't blown away. There's cheap beer but the food was pretty average and tasteless. I tried noodles, rice and even sweet and sour pork which was just lumps of fat in batter.
5
Stopped by here on a whim. Had the Chili Crab and it was DELICIOUS! Particularly good buns to go with it. The beer was cold, the crab was hot... All round a great meal!
5
Great food experience, but in very rustic surroundings. The true flavour of Chinatown. Try the Chilli Crab!
4
This place is something of a godsend in sticky, touristy Chinatown. Not only does it serve pretty decent seafood and the food and drinks are affordable, but it's a fabulous place for people-watching. There are even smokers' tables which - Singapore being th realm of anti-smoking - are taken by storm. Definitely not a place for fine dining, but also definitely not to be missed
5
Some friends staying at Marina Sands were moaning about the sticker shock of having a few beers near/in hotel. I had seen a sign for $6.50 beer for Tiger large bottles walking by the night before so we gave it a try. Sure enough 1/3 the price they were paying in their area. Great to stay in Chinatown! Sat on our plastic chairs and people watched for a few hours. Iced Lemon Tea great too. I don't actually drink beer so enjoyed a few iced teas as the table filled with beer bottles at a reasonable price. Worth a visit
4
My wife and I reserve every Friday evening for "end of week date night" and de-stresser. The beer is cold, the food is quite good and the people watching is some of the best anywhere we've seen in the world. Sevice can be spotty at times but the Tiger Beer Girls keep the beer coming and the service can be great at time as well. All in all, a great little slice of Singapore as the buildings (especially looking at the second floor structures) can, with a little imagination, transport you back to an earlier time
4
First off, it's a street cafe/restaurant but don't let that put you off, the food is out of this world! It's a loud, vibey, busy restaurant in the heart of a favourite tourist attraction, the staffare loud but very friendly and efficient, service is fast and the food, oh the food, it's out of this world! GOT to have the Chilli Crab, just can't get enough of it!If you're in Singapore, get yourself to Chinatown and get to this restaurant! Added bonus - it's really cheap too!
4
I was initially dubious of the place as I dont usually trust cafe/restaurants located in the middle of a tourist attraction. Plus the place was primarily filled with western tourists - another reason to avoid it! But we had to wait 15 mins for a calligraphy scroll and needed a break from the shops. We started with ordering drinks - the fresh mango juice was full of fruit (almost like a smoothie/sorbet), lime juice refreshing. We decided to order some dishes - chicken satay (okay) and belacan kangkong. The kangkong was so good we ordered another serve! Pleasantly surpirsed with the food we had. Convenient pitsstop in the heart of chinatown
4
Large beer bottles served in a bucket of ice. Cheapest beers we saw in Singapore. Service from the Tiger girls is very good. Came for a few beers everyday. Tried a few meals here all tasty, but nothing absolutely out of this world. Fantastic place to watch the world go by. Well worth a visit even if it's just for a few beers
5
Eat prawns , drink beer , fresh vegetables , watch foot ball live and enjoy thus simple but great food stop on the corner of two busy streets in china town .
5
Great quality food, decent sized portions in a street cafe right in middle of Chinatown. Very large bottles of ber (670ml) al at modest cost. A great find for a lunch venue while people watching. Would go back again .
4
Always nice to visit this place in Singapore.
Fantastic black pepper crab, the best in Singapore?
This is the place as we so far has visit each time in Singapore, 2011, 2014 and 2015.
5
We decided to go to Chinatown for our meal in the evening it really is a very vibrant area. We came across this restaurant and thought we would give it a go as it was full. We where not disappointed as the food was excellent and the cheapest tiger beer in town with a very large bottle costing $8.95 when we had paid as much as $17 for a pint elsewhere. The waitress was also very good and said a portion between us would be enough and it was.
1
Cabs very expensive 10 min (4.3 km) from Havelock Road to Garden by the bay charge SGD7 after 9pm double up the price. Don't go to Clarke Quay Singapore Chinatown Seafood Restaurant, we ordered 3 dishes only one crab SGD84(1.8kg), one taofu SGD24(medium size), one oyster fried egg SGD24(medium size), two rice SGD10, Wet tissue SGD10, beer SGD15 and tax SGD6 total cost SGD173 (for two adult and one kid) food portion are very small, not nice and super costly..
5
I have been revisiting this place since 2010 till present. I love the size of Sri Lanka crab here. My main dishes 1+ kilograms chili crab and bamboo clam. If eating with friends then will needed at least 2-3 crabs.. All stir fried veggie are good too. The Service kinda so so.. They hire less staff than it supposedly. This place is open during Chinese new year 2015 (I went on Feb 19) amazingly surprised and extremely happy :
4
Came here a day or two before Chinese new year and china town was thronging. I think this place strikes a good balance between having nicely prepared tasty dishes whilst being reasonably priced (but not as cheap as others). The only thing missing would ideally have been a greater choice of bee
2
Stopped here while wandering around the market. Noticed the food to be a bit more expensive than a lot of others around the market so I thought it may be the pick of the bunch, however we were wrong. The staff are very rude and seem very disappointed in you if you don't order heaps of beer. They are very pushy and seem in a rush to get you out of the restaurant if you are just simply chatting after your meal. The food was ok just basic food you can expect from anywhere really. I wouldn't recommend stopping here during the markets.
4
This restaurant is located very close to the Chinatown MRT station.The seating is plastic chairs and is not air-conditioned (but has fans) which adds to the experience. They sell 630ml bottles of Tiger beer for just over $8 (including tax and service fee). A real godsend on a humid Singapore day.I tried the Singapore Chilli Crab which was $56 (including tax and service fee). It came complete with all the equipment needed to break the crab from the shell. I was not an expert but the dish was tasty, messy and a tad expensive in my view.Service was friendly, fast and efficient
5
Really like this place. Beer is cold and reasonably priced. It's a basic place with plastic chairs and tables but the food is great. We snacked on a series of starters. Excellent! The restaurant is in a good location on the corner and really close to the Chinatown MRT station
5
A must visit restaurant when in Singapore.
Food was excellent - Duck recommended/tiger beer great....
Will go when back.
5
We have been to this restaurant before and enjoyed it. The tiger beer is extremely cold, food is great, it may not be the cheapest but it is very good and clean. Stunning location to people watch. Tables and chairs are plastic but this all adds to the experience. All the food is fresh and made to order.
4
Strategically located at the middle of Chinatown.Offers varities of seafood including famous SG Chilli Crab. a must try in SG. The Hainanese Chicken rice is good too! Price is abit expensive and also taste is okay. nothing too bad nor too good. For certain food items, there is minimum weight for the food. so please check carefully.
4
I came in the evening at this restaurant with my wife and two children. When ordering food, I ordered the Chili Crab with mantau, Orange Juice and white rice. But I saw, less friendly waiter and of his face looks like underestimate me and the family, as deemed unable to pay me the order.Likewise, when they wanted to pay, the waiter came up to me with a little lazy and submit the Bill. And I am waiting for my change was also quite long.Fortunately, we enjoy the taste of the food is quite entertaining ...Please fix the quality of service .... Thank you
5
Great food; great atmosphere; friendly helpful & efficient staff. Well priced food & drinks - good Singapore Sling!! Sit in plastic chairs; soak up the atmosphere; enjoy the food - chili crab a speciality......wonderful!! All of China Town is a free WiFi hub too.....& the MRT station is close by......
4
We have been to this restaurant before and enjoy it immensely. The tiger beer is extremely cold, and available in tallies. Food is great, it may not be the cheapest but it is very good, the waitresses are great and like to be very helpful and always smiling. Great location, you can have a nice cold drink and people watch if you want. Fried rice was very nice and honey pork also. Didn't try chilli crab but maybe next time. Tables are round plastic and plastic chairs but this all adds to the experience. All the food is fresh and made to order
4
An unbeatable combination to be had in the heart of the Chinatown market, on the corner of Pagoda Street. The scenery was always shifting with tourists from all corners of the earth browsing on the market stalls; the Tiger beer was cold and the spring rolls were freshly made. Add the prompt service and the efficient operation of the fans, and a pleasant sit-down was guaranteed. To be recommended
1
I know 1 out of 5 sounds tough but with so many good alternatives in the area, a Chinatown place needs to be good. We have been here a couple of times with visiting family but we are calling it quits from here. Food is acceptable, service is dreadful, location is excellent and value for money is poor. Walk a little further to around temple street for friendly and cheerful hawkers in the closed off street with good food for a quarter the price. If you go here, skip the food and get the icy cold cheap beer only. Staff will treat you terribly if you don't spend enough on food but ignore them and enjoy the refreshingly cold mugs of suds and the colorful view
3
I went here because of the Trip Advisor recommended posters all over the place. Did they really earn something?! I was a pretty disappointing visit! Over priced, pretty ordinary food with mediocre service. I actually got sprayed with water from a fish tank when one of the kitchen staff was doing something with the tank - that was the most refreshing part about my visit. The lady at the next table didn't enjoy it so much and her complaint wasn't handled very well at all. It is such a pity as I didn't spend many days in Singapore and I felt like I really wasted an opportunity for a better meal elsewhere. A similar restaurant in Hong Kong would have been incredible. Never again
2
The restaurant is located in a very convenient location within Chinatown, but the business seems have taken advantage of this location to serve overpriced, mediocre food to tourists who assume that is the best place in the area to eat. First of all, for a restaurant with a "Certificate of Excellence", their service was simply appalling. The staff were not friendly or welcoming at all and did not seem to be interested in serving us. Compared to other establishments around the area, the restaurant offered similar food at an inflated price, which deterred us from ordering many items. The food we were served was satisfactory, but the portion sizes were small and as mentioned was not worth the price. I suggest exploring more of Chinatown and taking a look at other restaurants or food stalls to find better food, service and value

Despite the plastic chairs and tables we thorughly enjoyed our visit to the Seafood restaurant. We choose typical chinese dishes and were not disappointed with the food served. The large Tiger beer is one of the cheapest served in Singapore , almost at supermarket price.

Ate here a third time within 4 days. 2 times for dinner and a lunch time also. The food is amazing, the staff are very friendly and yes there are so many places not far away which would charge a lot less but when you are on holiday you can't complain when the food is great and the staff are friendly. I have had much worse experiences for twice the price. Like I said, my wife and I ate lunch once and dinner twice, plus Tiger beers, Jamesons coffee and tea and in all we spent a little over $S150 which may be a lot compared to some places may seem like a lot but the food is great (sure I have already said that) and when you think that the tax on alcohol is high compared to UK this is well worth it. First time I had the Crocodile stir fry in black bean sauce (when I saw crocodile I just had to try it) which was nice but the mutton curry was fantastic and the beef fried rice was great also.

This is an informal eatery in the middle of Chinatown. It is very busy and the diners are about equal numbers of locals and tourists.Sit on plastic chairs at round plastic tables. No frills or fancy service. But, it is clean and comfortable.We ordered the chilli crab. Whilst waiting for our meal, we ordered large bottles of beer - simply because we noticed on the menu that it only cost a dollar more for the large bottles.Incidentally, the beers are less than half the price of beers in air-conditioned restaurants in this city. And of course, less than half the price of the airport bars.Incidentally, a tip: if you just want to top up with a quick beer at Changi airport, you can buy a cheap beer in the 7/11, convenience stores there.The menu is quite extensive and the prices are very favourable compared to restaurant charges. The arrival of the big platter of crab with lots of sauce, had us raising eyebrows! The crab had two legs missing! Huh? Then, we remembered that it was $48 for 800 grams. I guess they did not want to serve an over-size crab? But, what would they do with two legs?A highlight was the large red plastic aprons they provided, to avoid splashes/mess from the crab. We souvenired the aprons for memory lane. We have eaten crabs in many places in various parts of the world and sometimes had large table napkins to tuck into the collar? The aprons here was a first for us. It was an instant conversation piece.We thoroughly enjoyed our meal and would go again. And why not? The extra incentive is the voucher given to me by the friendly and efficient waitress, for "$10 off food bill > $50."I am sure you will not get chilli crab for less money. in fact, it is double that at East Coast. And so are the drinks.Excellent value for money here for freshly cooked food and quick service too.The food is very tasty and looking around at other tables, there was not much left on the plates, so I guess they enjoyed it as much as we did. In Asian restaurants, there is sometimes a few morsels leftover?I shall be back, if only to redeem the $10, offered

This restaurant is in a fantastic location, however the restaurant has used this advantage to rip off tourist. We saw their proud display in regards to their high trip advisor rating so we ate there. Their Chilli Crab is $48 for 800g, however wait for it, there are hidden cost, there is also a 10% service charge and also a 7% GST charge. We ordered the Chilli Crab, however the waitress did not weigh the crab, it was just brought out and we soon knew why. The crab was not fresh, it was pre prepared earlier, the shell was empty which suggest that they reuse their shell. The meat in the crab was reasonable, however it was not tasty. We also ordered prawns and other dishes which has been displayed.Overall I was really disaapointed, the food I had at Hawker stands were much nicer and 80% of their asking price. Stay away from this restaurant

Disappointed... Don't get me wrong, the food is good but it's WAY overpriced for what you get.. I got the honey chicken(I think that's what it was called) and I enjoyed it but the prices are hiked up because it s in the middle of the touristy Chinatown... If you go to the other side(next to the MRT), you can find the same dish for $5 instead of $16. It's a nice little place but I'd rather be surrounded by locals, eating food off of a menu I can't read and paying the local price.Oh and service wasn't good. 2 of the waitresses got in an argument in front of all of us. And they just want you in and out as fast as possible.

Perfect location to enjoy China town. Super ambience and I will definitely consider a beer there again. However food was extremely over priced, same with the Tiger beers. Had to chase down my waiter as she happily assumed that me paying with bills allowed her not to give me any change..... Really not ideal. I would actually have tipped her but her just taking without even asking is just rude. Hope it is the one waiter and not the whole staff.Not a no go from my side as an establishment but be aware of the service or lack of, and pay with equal money. :

I came here last year and found the food really good. Came back to Singapore for one day en route to New Zealand and went straight back here and got another good quality meal, served speedily ,,,,contrary to other reviews staff were polite even though they were busy. The fried rice was best cooked fried rice I've ever had
3
I enjoyed the black pepper crabs, but they were admittedly a tad expensive. So too is the price of the beer. Which is I think why I did not see many locals at this restaurants but lots of westerners/foreigners. But if you can overlook the pricing, the Chinatown atmosphere compliments the food
5
We passed this restaurant in Chinatown and it looked busy, with a mix of western and eastern customers. The food looked delicious. Although we planned to visit a smarter restaurant, but decided to give this a try and we were not disappointed. The serve was efficient and friendly, and I tried a few unusual dishes, one being a crispy sesame calamari which was fabulous. I would recommend this restaurant as it isn't at all expensive, is clean, the food superb and the service is friendly
4
A great spot for a cold reasonably priced beer at lunch or whilst friends are shopping. It is located in the heart of Chinatown and near the MRT. The food is also good and the staff friendly and attentive. Impossible to miss as it occupies a large frontage on the corner of Trengganu & temple St.
2
70 Sing dollars fot the black peppar crab which weighed 1,2 kilo, yummi thought I. I got the meat 2 crab claws, not worth it.
5
Lived in Chinatown, so we usually came for brunch or supper. The seafood are awesome, the beer is very cheap here. We came for the black pepper crab for 2 times, taste very good, but do not request staffs were very friendly.
4
Had lunch at this restaurant found it to be very pleasing the meal was very tasty , service very good prices good and a great place for people watching would recommend this place
5
Middle of Chinatown open plan and always busy..from the owner always in yellow charming always to the staff always busy always efficent. ..food is good tiger beer always cold and it's highly recommended a look in will show you the people enjoying the food
5
We have eaten here three or four times over the last couple of years the food is always great and is good value for money. The Chilli Crab was enough for the two of us to share at $48 we thought was excellent.(try it with the crab fried rice) The Service is good however you have to attract the attention of the very busy staff as they are happy to leave you to sit and people watch
4
The listing of seafood on the menu was quite reasonable for a restaurant of this size but the total cost was well above what you can get in Singapore if you know where to go. Service was good but the meals were more of a fast food quality than restaurant standard. The reason that we tried this place was due to the very large signage stating how they won a tripadvisor award for 4 star quality. I would have put it at 3.5 stars but not 4. Compared with many other open market eating houses in and about Chinatown it was more upmarket than most but we experienced better tasting food elsewhere at about a quarter of the cost. If you have the time shop about some of the places where the locals eat, I had one of the best Green Thai curry I have tasted in a long time at one of the nearby food market for $4.50 as an example
4
Love to sit here, sipping on a cold beer, and people watch. There is so much activity in Chinatown, it's just fun to look around. I always get satay and some Thai rice, which is yummy. Remember to ring the little bell on the table for service, and for the check, otherwise you will be sitting there for a long time
5
We stumbled across this place for a feed & rest from our shopping around the area.The service from the staff was excellent, the food was great & the Tiger beer was cold and cheap.The owner of the place was even serving us, she was a lovely lady and nothing was a problem.We will be going back again.Highly recommend
4
Sure this place is basic but what if lacks in furnishings it more than makes up for in the quality of food and value of drinks. Black Pepper Crab, Seafood Rice and Prawns were all good value and tasty. Beer slightly more than half the price for double the volume of most other restaurants in Singapore. Have seen some comments re the staff but can say that we experienced no problems with them, all were good natured and polite, if a little rushed. Will certainly come back when next in Singapore
4
Been to this place 3 times. Brilliant location in the middle of buisy Chinatown, tasty and large portions, cheap beer and drinks. Staff are strict so they can seem unfriendly but they are just being efficient. Never had any issue with this place. Would not hesitate to come back
1
Nothing good to write about this place. Had 3 different dishes and all 3 were average, staff were rude and pushy.
Would not recommend and will not be returning.
1
This place has either gone down in standard or has been reviewed by people who don't know what they're meant to be eating.The staff are rude, slow and from what I seen with other customers downright cheeky. The food is bland and westernised so much so that there is no flavour present bar from the chewy dried chilli that quite frankly is not fit for human consumption. Do not stop here like we foolishly did after getting off the metro. Continue over a few streets to the food market street.
3
We stopped here to try the chilli crab due to the trip advisor sign being displayed out the front. The first young male waiter that was serving us was great and really friendly he brought us cold icy beers almost immediately. We ordered the chilli crab with sweet buns which was delicious. The only down side was when we requested more drinks or napkins othe female waitresses we very rude and replied with a "what do you want". In summary food was delicious but the service by female waiters was very poor especially because we were paying $80 for a meal.
3
This restaurant is situated right in the heart of the pedestrianised bit of Chinatown. It does good food. Fresh and interesting. And a wide range. It has Formica tables and the staff aren't trying to make you linger after you've eaten. But you could do far worse. And the beers, for Singapore, aren't too expensive! My score of average is just in the harsh side - but I didn't want to say it was very good! it's good. Good enough for me to go back from time to time but it is what it is. A reasonably good seafood restaurant with tables spilling onto the road!
4
Great place to come and refresh after a morning in Chinatown! Great prices, didn't eat but food looked ok! $6.95 for a cold Tiger....can't go to far wrong with that! Sports on the TV for those who wanted it...free wifi from 'Chinatown' think I might be heading back in a couple of hours after hitting the market again!
1
We were greeted "Want beer???" as all others that stopped to take a look on their menu. Unfortunately we let the Excellence Certificate scam us to eat there, probably the worst dishes so far. The waiter was ignoring us completely when she realised we weren't there for the beer and went away to hunt people from the street. Second waiter seemed more promising, she actually picked out order and showed a sad face - no alcohol??? We started to think that the girls are gaining comission by selling the drinks.We end up paying 4 times more than in other restaurants, waiting for ages (to order, for drinks, the bill...) because the ladies were too busy to gossip, food was regular and the service rude
4
OK it is not gourmet, but it does not claim to be. As others have said this is good value street food, with an outstanding offer on Tiger beerThe result is that it is very busy. The service is therefore a bit hit and miss, but you are not paying for waiters in dinner jackets.But the food is good. My prawns cooked with oatmeal we jumbo sized, and fresh, and well cooked. My wife's sweet and sour pork was excellent. The beer was cold, as well as cheap.The restaurant is situated on a busy corner. I don't think they were racist in not wanting a previous Indian reviewer to sit on an outside table to drink just a cup of tea, that is a pragmatic approach to business, you put the better spending clients thereIf you go to Chinatown, then I recommend this restaurant as a good place to stop. We ate here two years ago, and returne
4
As most women love to shop and there is plenty of that in Chinatown shopping, I was tired of following my wife and sat down here. The service staff asked what I wanted to order and the first thing I saw was a cold large Tiger beer for $6.95 - which is great value by Singapore standards. What presided was many more hours and beers into the early night, and the atmosphere in this busy commuter intersection was glowing. The kids had several thick shakes which truly made the word "thick" a reality. Upon looking at the menu prices and the food that was being ordered around us, it all looked pretty good
2
I have visited this restaurant on 25 th evening when I was shopping at Chinatown.. When I had asked for Tea the attending lady was quiet disappointed looking at us. they ask us to change the table as many Europeans were there. Then came the tea. when I asked the lady if I can sit on another empty table outside , in front of us she had kept sign of reserved table on that one. Quite disgusting .. ! Is racism and colonial system still there even after Singapore got independence 
4
We saw this place whilst wandering around the markets in Chinatown. We came back for dinner and was not disappointed. The chilli crab was excellent (although I felt it was not the 800 grams we paid for), the rice also very good and the prawn and pork balls we had for entree also delicious. Also an ice bucket to keep the beer cold. The staff were a bit "hit or miss" but the food definitely was worth the visit
5
We went back to this place multiple times during our short stay in Singapore. The service was simply excellent, the food was superb (although some items were pricey) and the location is perfect to people watch!
4
Stumbled upon this place by chance. Really relaxed atmosphere on the street near to the train station for China Town. Plastic chairs to sit on so it's not a fancy place but the food was really good. Only critisism is that our meals came out seperately and then we waited ages for rice after that. Beer was so cheap in comparision to every where else in Singapore. It was S$6.50 approx £3.25 for a large tiger beer. I would defo reccomend this place.
4
Located in the main market street this bustling little cafe sells large bottles of icy cold Tiger beer for $6.95 along with traditional Singaporean food, noodles, won tons, spring rolls, rice dishes etc. plenty of tourists eating/drinking in here which is what attracted us. Great range of drinks at good prices including mocktails, cocktails and a range of juices/soft drinks. Will eat here again before we go.
4
Decided to eat here after arriving late into Singapore on a 3 day trip as my hotel (Bliss Hotel) was just around the corner.I choose the 'Crispy Prawn Balls' to start followed with the 'Szechwan Chicken Fillet'... Both were very nice but I thought the Chicken would have a sauce but it was dry (fried) with peanuts, a few spring onions and lots of dried red chilli. It was very nice (I love spicy food) just not 100% what I was expecting. It did not come with any rice at all, not that I needed it as I had plenty to eat.I washed it down with a couple of large bottled Tiger Beer's which were nice and cold. Total cost of the two dishes and two large beers was SG$45.35 (about GB£22.00)... Beers were SG$6.95 each (~GB£3.35) and they were over a Pint each, so good value. Service was friendly and fast.The Restaurant (Café) is situated on the corner of Pagoda Street in the heart of Chinatown and it is popular with tourists and locals alike (a good sign). I ate here pretty late, like 10:30pm, and they were still quite busy, although time I had finished at about 11:15 they were shutting up it seemed. A great spot to watch the world go by and soak up the ambience of Singapore's lively Chinatown district with some good local beer and some authentic Chinese food
4
One of many streetside places in Chinatown - but this one always seems to be busy with locals and tourists alike when we visit unlike many of the others which is always a good sign. Food is good - between us we had chilli crab, a couple of prawn dishes and sides all of which were very good and served quickly. Tiger beer is cheap too, service OK (it is a street restaurant after all) and represents great value for money in Singapore. To be recommende
3
Very casual restaurant in Chinatown Packed with customers. Staff are obviously very busy but service very average and waiters/ waitresses not very friendly. Ordered prawns in oatmeal crust. Prawns were plump and large, very well cooked but oatmeal sickly sweet. Nice blend of chillies and green curry leaves but not even that could neutralise the sweet oatmeal. Ordered a tequila sunrise but waitress said it's not available?? you must take the Singapore sling, which was far too sweet
3
I found beer(Tiger) here cheapest amongst restaurants in Singapore. Downside was the rude waitresses. Its a very casual joint nothing fancy about it.Still it was filled with tourists(I guess cheap beer :)If you are looking for vegetarian food then skip this place as they have only spring roll and fried noodles to offer you.Location: Opposite to heritage centre, 2 mins walk from Chinatown MR
1
I went to this restaurant because of trip advisors review. This is completely misleading. The service was very poor, waitresses were not friendly, food was crap. We had chilli crab, completely overrated, black pepper beef, very blend, the only good thing was the fried rice. When served the crab, we had to call the waitress as we were only given one paper towel and nothing to crack the shell or clean our hands. Eventually, she provided us with two nut crackers and another paper towel. She also provided us with two plastic aprons. The beer was ok. The end price was $105.00. This was extremely expensive, for what we got which was 1 x chilly crab, 2 x beers, 1 x black pepper beef and 1 x fried rice. You will find better food and service at one of the other little restaurants around the corner. I will not not be mislead by trip advisers review again
5
Restaurant in the middle of Chinatown. Go with a lot of people and order a lot. Everything is great. Try the spicy chili crab and order bread to soak up the sauce. Tiger beer on ice closes the deal. Don't miss it. Not fancy from the street but great for people watching
5
After walking and shopping and more shopping i could see himself fading fast, so we came upon this resturant which we were glad we found it. The lady outside asked if we wanted smoking or non smoking we got the nearest table as we were very hungry. We ordered firstly 2 large Tiger beers which were in a ice bucket to keep them extra cold, we got the menu which covered everything including meat fish and veg dishes, We decided to order a selection of different dishes so we could pick and mix, they had the live crab, lobster and different fish to choose from, Chilli crab is a must mm mm mm mm, himself was always himin and hawin about satay sauce at home so he tried it here and he was reborn, The meal was lovely, the beers were cold and we finished off with espressos,There seemed to be locals and tourists which was a reason why we ate there aswel
4
This place was pumping every time we walked past. Food was not so cheap, but the Tiger beers were. Chilli crab is a popular Singaporean dish also served here. Satay was also nice
5
Have tried different things as the Roasted Duck with Curry which was delicious.. If you pass through the Pagoda Street, after having enjoyed the market, stop here for lunch or dinner! Local, relaxing, traditional and tasty.
4
Been coming here for many many years. Love this place! Cheap quarts of beer and good good food. Great for people watching. We call it yellow chairs. All my fiends come here too.
5
Myself and my friend visited here tonight (17th August 2014) and had a brilliant meal. Service was quick, helpful and polite. Food was amazing and very cheap with a good vegetarian selection for my friend. Would definitely return when I am next in Singapore.
5
Must order Singaporean Chilli Crab here. Absolutely beautiful dish. 1kg is $60sgd which is one of the best prices around the Chinatown area. Couple it with fried bread, and a very large ice cold Tiger beer,will finish of any night.Service is absolutely great, constant top ups of beers, friendly and efficient, even though it was a very busy night.Highly recommende
5
This restaurant was always our "go to" place for great food and nice cold Tiger beer. Just the place to sit and chill in between the hectic pace of shopping and general sightseeing. easy to get to via the MRT, station right in the heart of Chinatown. Friendly, attentative staff
4
This place was recommended to us by a friend and it was well worth the trip!Large, well priced menu with something for everyone. Food was amazing! Service was great and food arrived very quickly even though the place was packed! Would definitely recommend.Look out for the big red tables with the yellow chairs
5
Saw the menu outside with the Chili Crab, and we just had to have one. The service was fast and the food was gorgeous, so the next night we went back and just had to try the Black Pepper Crab, just as good. The following night they served us Garlic Prawns, delicious again. These meals were accompanied with Tiger beer or two, of course. Highly recommended
4
Gorgeous Girlfriend and I stumbled on this great eatery while wandering around Chinatown, Singapore. We slaked our thirst with a Singapore Sling and waited for our meal: roast duck curry, crocodile with ginger and spring onion and a super fried rice. What a treat. Sitting in the open air, watching the world go by, and soaking up the atmosphere. Well worth a visit
4
Stumbled across this place whilst walking around Chinatown and most pleased this was the place I decided to stop for a nice cold refreshment. Initially only stopping for a beer and then tempted by the fine looking food being served decided to see in more detail what they had to offer. Went for the beef in black bean spicy source with a chilli egg fried rice that were both superb, all of which washed down with a ice cold bottle of tiger beer and at $9 for a big bottle something of a treat in Singapore! Overall this little gem is in a great location to watch the world go by and sample some great food and cold beer and all done with a smile. This gem is defiantly on my agenda during my next Singapore visit.
5
This is a perfect place to watch locals and tourists shopping around Chinatown! Very friendly staff, cool beer at an excellent price and fresh seafood! Fantastic spicey squid - really tender - excellent taste and yes, my husband enjoyed the singapore crab very much!
5
Called in at lunch and had the pork belly, pepper beef and fried rice and we really enjoyed our meal. Washed it down with a couple of Tiger beers too. Staff were okay but run off their feet.
5
At the price, and eating in the heart of China Town - at plastic tables and chairs - this is a place worth trying. A special heart for Tiger beers, served chilled in a ice bucked by a nice "beer waitress"....
4
Had the black pepper beef steamed rice and a cold beer. The price was excellent and portion was massive . The beer was ice cold and cheaper than most . Well worth it very impressed .
5
Me and my husband had eaten here on our last visit to Singapore and were looking forward to going back! It didn't disappoint the service is good and friendly! The food is tasty and fresh, the tiger beers go down well with the spicy food! Great for relaxing and watching world go by! Don't get me wrong the plates are plastic the tables and chairs too not a top dining experience! But I rate it highly for value for money and overall experience!

We have visited this restaurant on many occasions over the years and always make a point of taking our visitors. It is in a great location for you to soak in the atmosphere and watch the hustle and bustle as tourists and locals alike shopping in the many outlets.All the staff are good and with little effort from yourself you can end up having a good laugh with the waiters, waitresses and beer girls.This place is great for seafood and in particular chilli and black pepper crabs but my favourite is the chilli stingray which on this occasion was as tough as old boots and if the mama San had been on duty we would have said something. That said we will not let one bad dish spoil our memories of the many good visits.No doubt that there are cheaper places around but this is Chinatown and as a great vibe.We will be bac

This restaurant is located right in the middle of Chinatown caters for a tourist crowd and does it well the food is tourist Chinese the beers cold and cheap staff are friendlyiit's the only tourist restaurant I eat in anywhere love the passing crowd love the atmosphere and people seem to enjoy the experience ther
1
Seriously, how many locals? Damn even the servers (beer girls etc) are foreigners. Food quality is so-so. It's a good taste test for tourists, but the fact that locals shy away from this restaurant... I think that summarises the popularity. At least amongst locals.We, the Singaporeans of Singapore, we know where to go for crabs, and all other things in the sea. Perhaps not terribly much cheaper, but surely tastier than this corner restaurant.Oh yes, and this is not the only establishment selling cold Tiger beers. Unless you're a tourist in one of the hostels/boutique hotels nearby, with very little time to explore, or without a local friend to bring you around... then I guess you have no choice but to eat at this place
5
Had been highly recommended and was rightly so. Don't let the plastic chairs and tables deter you from eating here. The beer is cheap and icy coldService is excellentAnd the chilli crab was awesome. Staff firstly fit you with a plastic bib which is required for the crab feast to come. Then it is all in fingers and all. Sweet buns and rice a must to accompany the crab.Great place to people watch and the wait staff scurrying around this very busy restaurantWe found for once in Singapore that the prices were not extreme and you got a great meal for what you pay
1
We stayed in Singapore Chinatown for 3 days. We ate almost everywhere there was to eat, most very delicious and a good price.For our last meal we went to Chinatown Seafood, we ordered 3 plates of different seafood and 1 plate chicken.It looked good, but after trying some of each, it was awful.Disgusting food, we could only eat a small portion off each plate and gave up.We asked for the bill and got another shock at the price charged for garbage.Avoid this place at all costs
4
Nice place to get out of the heat! Beer an food is cheap for Singapore standards and there is a smoking area too which is very rare in Singapore. Only minus is the look of the restaurant and area, but you can't have everything:)
5
It has great tasting food at really good prices. And it has super colourful surroundings and is smack dab in the middle of Chinatown - great for people watching. It's huge so it always has space - smoking and non-smoking.
5
Several friends have recommended we stop for a beer and a meal here and we weren't disappointed. Great spot for a relaxing break in the middle of exciting Chinatown.
4
we have been going to this restaurant on our last three trips to Singapore and the food and service has always been 1st class. This is far better than the East Coast offerings at 1/2 the priceApart from the usual Chinese offerings, which are always good their best is the Chilli and Black Bean Crabs along with the lobsters also don't forget the garlic prawns.Prices are good, expect to pay under a 1/3 of what you would pay in Australia.They also have the coldest Tiger beers in Singapore at reasonable prices.When you get to Chinatown take the Pagoda St exit from the MRT and its 50 metres straight ahead on the right hand side. All you have to do is eat delicious food drink cold beer and watch the world go by, a great afternoon and or evening out. Don't miss it
4
Catch the MRT to Chinatown exit the Pagoda street exit, plastic chairs and big round tables don't spoil the atmosphere as you can watch the market trade passing as you sip a cold beer.The Duck was delicious and the chicken with Szechuan stir fry was also good. Prices are reasonable for Singapore (actually quite cheap) and you can stroll around the markets afterwards we went twice and after the first visit were given a $10 off Voucher for our next visit 
4
Excellent location in the heart of Chinatown, with some of the cheapest beer in Singapore.This restaurant has lots of tables so getting a seat is not usually a problem except maybe Chinese New Year.The service is ok, but the dishes are never served at the same time and the servers need to work on their table manners, also the food menu is quite pricey compared to some org he street food available nearby.That said we have been too many times to count and the food is always very tasty and the outside tables allow a good view of the hustle and bustle of 2 of the main streets in Chinatown.Great place to spend time with friends
4
Visited for the second time recently - and deliberately went back as we enjoyed it so much the first time. Enjoyed the location, the prompt and friendly service and the food. Had Sichuan chicken (again) and a couple of rice dishes, of course with some Tiger beer. Fairly "basic" but very good tastes. Overall seems suited to its busy location and we will go there again
2
This would have got 1 star from me had it not been for the very cheap beer (tiger). the crab is very expensive and average. the meals were adequet at best. if looking for a good feed try the heritage centre restaurant opposite for $40 crab- far better idea. also service here is terrible. wait staff are rude and pushy
2
A favourite hangout of mine for a cold Tiger at $6.95. Love the location and simplicity but food average. In fact the two seafood dishes we ordered were very poor. Prawns were rubbery and virtually inedible. The Beef dish with lemongrass was however very good. Not sure I would eat here again though as can do much better
4
Excellent food! You certainly won't regret the food here. Never mind the service without a smile, and ignore the prices as well....just follow your eyes and stomach! opposite of the restaurant is 'The Singapore Heritage Restaurant' with a board written 'Recommended by: tripadvisor'....i feel like running over the other side and nick the board to place it in front of here instead, as they are empty compared to here! the good thing is competition....but competition for taste is the most important! Well done 'Chinatown Seafood'. Do keep it up, and do find ways to improve as well.
3
Gains its street cred from the popular popsition, great for watching the ever busy Pagoda St. Food only average, service fairly indifferent but a good pause for a tiger beer and a sit down. Better for a light lunch than dinner
4
Tried this place for the Chilli Crab seemed nice, except for the hundreds of bits of broken shell, unsure if it is meant to be like that or just poor execution of the dish. Tasted good.
2
Had dinner here our first night in Singapore, we'd been before many years ago. Very busy bustling corner with outdoor seating, but really nothing else good about it. Surly staff. Tiny tasteless meals. My son and I ordered the $18 duck to share - must have weighed 100g. Since we only had 2 nights in Singapore, I was really disappointed to have squandered one meal on this restaurant. Our meal cost us $70 SGD for 2 fried rice, 1 small bowel of steamed rice and 1 duck with 4 beers and a coke
4
This place is located on the busiest corner in Chinatown and offers an exciting people watching experience. The food was good, but nothing special (we had a couple of noodle and fired rice dishes). The prices are great compared to other places around Singapore. The service was poor since we had to ask for utensils after our food arrived and the waitress looked like we were bothering her anytime we asked for something, but this isn't a place you go for good service
5
Great chili crab washed away with some tiger beer. Crab was of great flavour and quality plenty of meat. Beers where nice and cold. Service excellent. They even put the bibs on for us when it looked like we were messing ourselves up. We came back some days later to try some different things as well. Excellent will go back if in singapor
2
We’ve been here before a few years ago, loved it and wanted to return. I’m not sure if our expectations were too high but we left disappointed in the food and will go elsewhere next time.The location is the best in Chinatown and makes for a great atmosphere. The service is what you’d expect from a packed, fast moving restaurant – prompt, rushed but friendly and cheerful. Dishes arrive at different times which is fine but the quality wasn’t great. We had garlic prawns which were quite tasteless and then were delivered the wrong main course which could have been an ordering issue but I don’t think so.Prices seem a lot more than 2 years ago too so not one we’ll visit again unfortunately.

Don't go here solo. Had been here a couple times because the tiger beers were cheap, but my last night there I splurged for the chili crab. It was as I would say acceptable but definitely not worth 50 dollars. I've had better in Singapore. They are mostly worried about filling seats and it doesn't matter what your service was like. I'll pay more for tigers somewhere else

Chinatown Seafood Restaurant is on the corner of Pagoda and Japanese Streets - in one of the busiest areas of Chinatown. We visited the restaurant twice during our Lunar New Year trip to Singapore and were very pleased on both occasions. The food is excellent and extremely reasonably priced, plus the cold Tiger is a great asset in a hot and humid chinatown! Staff are very attentive and food delivery is rapid, but perhaps the best thing is the location. You get all of the sights and smells (unfortunately Durian at this time of year(!)), whilst sitting in comfort with a cold beer!Highly recommended

Went here with a group of 8 which quickly morphed into 10. They were able to accommodate us easily with a big round table. We sat towards the edge of the restaurant which is basically all outdoor seating. We ordered chili crab, black pepper crab, noodles, veggies, rice, and chicken (and washed it down with some beers). Everything was fresh and tasty, and reasonably priced. The staff was super - friendly, speedy, helpful, with a good sense of humor. All in all, no complaints - a solid meal in Chinatown with some classic Singaporean cuisine
4
We had to queue at the resturant for about 15-20 mins but well worth it. It was Chinese New Year though and very busy. Food was great (Squid and lemon chickens wings plus crab rice). Its a terrific place for sitting with some good food and a cold beer to watch the world go by. Very close to the Chinatown MRT station in Pagoda. If in the area give it a go. You wont be disappointe
5
We ate in the Seafood Chinatown Restaurant two days in a row. I could not leave Singapore without tastng the huge CHILE CRABS. It so delicious and the best crabs I have eaten for a long time.
4
Visited here many times during our stay in Singapore either for lunch time drink or meal. Staff always welcoming, smiling and attentive ice cold Tiger and very good tasty food quickly and well prepared with good portion sizes. Prices very reasonable especially the Tiger.
5
This is the best spot for people watching whilst quaffing icy mugs of Tiger beer at probably the best price i town of 6.75 a bottle and eating tasty food. I haven't had everything on the menu yet but it has all been excellent so far on the many times I have eaten there. The staff always keeps your mug full and the cold Tigers coming and now they take creditcards so no worries about spending all your cash on Tiger and noodles and chili crab and satay and .... and not having any left to get souvenirs for the peeps back home
4
This spot combines great people watching with good seafood.. We visited a couple of weeks before Lunar New Year and the area was almost overwhelmed with shoppers and strollers. Service was prompt and the food was quite good. For a party of six, we had spring rolls, steamed dumplings, four types of prawns, lobster, and a beef dish. All were flavorful and hot. The Tiger Beer was excellent for washing this down. The restaurant staff were efficient without making one feel rushed. The whole scene was quite exciting
5
We just had our first trip to Singapore and one our musts was Chilli crab. Found this restaurant whilst wondering through the markets, we picked here because it looked right! Big tanks with fish swimming around, fresh lobster and fresh mud crabs. We were not disappointed, the staff were great and very helpful, device was quick and the chilli crab...Awesome!!We had a table right on the edge of the restaurant. Fantastic place to watch the people go by and some wonderful old Singapore architecture to look at. In our opinion this place is a must!
3
Make sure to go hungry. We ordered 2 orange chicken meals which we could have gotten away with one. If it's your first time in Singapore be sure to order a "tiger beer". The restaurant lies right in the heart of some amazing shops and markets
4
Not fancy, but nice food and with very cold beer. The restaurant is in the heart of Chinatown so it was very busy. They serve a good variety of Chinese food. The food arrived quickly and was very tasty. Service was very good as well. It's all simple, but worth the stop
4
I guess I've been coming here for close on 20 years and it never fails to please. Singapore used to be full of corner restaurants with plastic tables. This is one of the few remaining - certainly this close to CBD. And if you want to gaze at some traditional street architecture over your Tiger Beer this is probably the only place.The Chilli Crab is fresh and to die for. You'll love it, and so will your Bank Manager. Tiger Beer at under 7 dollars; it's 12.50 dollars a pint on Boat Quay. I've just got back from another great evening. And City won 3-0 on the telly. Lots of smiles from me....and all the girls. I think even the Crab had a grin
3
We went here 3 times as the food was good and reasonably priced but every time the female staff wore faces that would turn the milk sour. The males were fine in there but the females are letting this place down big style. Shame, just a few manners and a friendly smile would change the place dramatically
2
The location is good but that's just about all this place has going for it! The service was fairly slow and quite unfriendly. The beer was good - it comes in a bottle so hard to go wrong there - but overpriced. The food was okay but not great and again, way too expensive by Singapore standards. On top of the already expensive meal, they added on GST AND a "service charge" - I wouldn't mind paying for the service if it was good, but it wasn't! This place appears to me to be a tourist trap and is best avoided. There are plenty of other eateries nearby which aren't nearly as exorbitantly priced - eat there instead
5
Very delicious meals, great location, Prawn Fritters is fantastic, don't miss it. During our touristic visit to Singapore, we had dinner in this restaurant one night, we liked it so much and we ate there once again in the next day.
2
Also known as Ba Dao Guan, which is what the (hefty) bill says. This place trades on its great location much like the Boat Quay places. Food and beer are expensive here with a Tiger $7.95, the most I have seen it on the street.
4
I think this is a really good budget restaurant. Compared with other establishments in Singapore! The beer and glasses are really cold. Excellent wontons and spring rolls. The place is usually packed. That has to be a good sign. I'd certainly return.
3
Two of us order meal. We get it in relays with 5 minute intervals. The crabmeat fried rice had very little crabmeat. Deep fried battered chicken could have been anything.
Only thing good is the cold beer and the location for people watching.
5
While exploring Chinatown being typical tourists I developed a thirst and the rain started. Thankfully we were right next to Chinatown Seafood Restaurant which is on a corner and with its plastic furniture doesnt look so appealing. Dont let that fool you.I noticed they were doing 1 litre bottles of Tiger beer for around Â£4, by far the cheapest beers I had found in Singapore. The staff are frantic though its controlled and they are lightning fast with orders, service and bills.We didnt eat but the whole place is covered in fish tanks with all manner of fresh seafood on show. A real testament to any restaurant is the amount of locals eating in it and Chinatown Seafood restaurant was full of locals tucking into the food
4
We ordered a deep fried sea bass, sambal stingray, and char kway taeo with live prawns. All were delicious. Full of flavour. Great sauces. The fish had a fantastic sweet soy, garlic, and ginger sauce. The fish was perfectly cooked and well presented, butterfly flayed to hold the sauce like a boat. The sambal stingray had a great sambal sauce coating. I'd never eaten stingray before, and it was an experience, with its edible cartiledge bone and rich flake-like flesh. Worth trying at least once. It had a medium spice level. The char kway taeo was very rich in flavour without being spicy. Prawns were flavoursome , but be aware that there are only 4 medium prawns. Messy when removing the heads but the shell was soft enough to be edible. Nice strong Baron's Strong Beer (8.8%) to wash it down. Fast and attentive but not over-bearing service. A shady, fan cooled setting, with a nice view of the passers by. S$88 total. Recommended.
4
Been here several times over different times. But still keep coming back. Great place to cool off with a beer and do some serious people watching. Chili crab is sold by weight, we find a small one to share is always enough. Though last time, it was pretty hot, needed extra rice.
5
We found this place whilst shopping in the surrounding markets, great location on the corner for you to sit, have an icy cold tiger beer, eat some nice food and people watch with a great vibe about the place. Menu also offers a wide range of selection, other than just seafood. Try the steam pork dumplings, beef stir fry, spring rolls. We loved it so much, we went back again to try their Chilli Mud Crab - WOW !!! Service was quick, beers came with an ice bucket and they consistently replaced your glasses with new icy cold glasses. Beats the overpriced restaurants around Clarke Quay
5
What a great experience. Perfectly positioned on the corner of two busy streets, just steps away from the China town MRT station. You can sit here for hours watching the hustle and bustle going on around you. The Tigers are brought to you in a ice bucket, with frozen glasses. Delicious. The food is fabulous too, its not cheap for street food, a meal for two of us with beers was around $80, so you could probably eat elsewhere more cheaply, but this is a spot where the entertainment all around you is worth the extra few dollars. Its always very busy too, the Heritage restaurant opposite almost always empty, that should say a lot
2
We stopped here for a bite and a drink while visiting Chinatown. Good tea and iced coffee, though the prawns were below par and the dumpling soup was dull and old (read: re-heated several times). The dumplings were almost raw and the pork filling was hard and cheap. Also, we paid 45 dollars for the above! Not recommended, go elsewhere.
4
This restaurant is located on a busy corner in Chinatown. Its a great place to just kick back relax and enjoy a meal or just something small and don't forget to cool off with a big bottle of Tiger beer!
4
Just had a quick dinner here yesterday with my wife and was a wonderful one..
Location wise, i think this place has the best spot compare to others.. Food is great and price was decent..
Wouldnt mind coming back here every visit to chinatown
5
We eat here every time we are in Singapore and always for the sublime black pepper crab. It beats chilli crab hands down as the best crab in Singapore. We had a lot of other dishes also and all have been delicious - haven't had a dud yet and the service is pretty good. Great spot for icy cold beers, great food and people watching. You can't go wrong.
4
We live in Singapore and eat here all the time. We've never ordered anything that we didnt like. The food is consistently good. The beer is always ice cold and refreshing. Plus, we always get good service which is next to unheard of in Singapore. Not to mention it's a good place to just sit back, relax and watch the shoppers go by
5
A hive of activity. Great location outside Chinatown MRT. Full if people taking a break from shopping the busy street vendors outside. It is open air so not a good place if you need ac. A good value I paid about S$10 for a plate of Hong Kong Style Fried Noodles. Many seafood choices on the menu. I think it is a must stop when visiting Chinatown
4
Stopped here for some food on a Fri evening. Place was a hive of activity with people eating, have a beer or two and generally watchong ghe world go by. Open air eating on the corner right by Chinatown MRT, so great location. Shelled prawns with curry was delicious and spicey!! Beers well priced too. Definitely recommend for an easy evenings eating. Enjoy.
5
Spent several meals at this restaurant. It's so busy (rightly so). Staff are amazing - remembering your order and bringing the most delicious things to you.For my husbands 40th we spent about 4-5 hours here, people watching ordering recommended things, trying new things and reordering our favourites.So reasonably priced for gorgeous food - I just loved it here and it was my favourite place to go
4
Hate to tell you all, but the beer has gone up to over $7 for a big bottle, but still fantastic value. Food very tasty. They don't seem to have any concept of bringing the food out together. Two of us ordered different main courses and there was 5 to 10 minutes between them arriving. However, we have been here 4 or 5 times and will go bac
5
Every time we come to Singapore this is the restaurant we eat at. Situated right on a corner, it is a great spot for people watching. The service is efficient and the food is delicious and well priced. The tiger beer at $5.90 for a large bottle is excellent value. We have tried many of the dishes and have never been disappointed
3
Great location, we ordered a rice dish and thought we would try the chilli crab. The rice dish came out 15 minutes before the crab so was cold by the time the crab came. The rice dish was good, the crab meat was moist but the chilli sauce tasted like there was tin tomatoes in it so very average for a meal that cost $48 and that was the cost of the crab only. Rice dish was $9.60. We had to ask for a bowl and serviettes to clean up with as of course crab is very messy. They did bring it out with paper serviettes. When we went to pay they had added $2.00 per person for the clean up bowls which blew us away. We could be forgiving for the meal in itself as it was our choice but pretty cheeky that they added more money onto an already expensive meal, I might add that we were not given any serviettes at all. I'm sure the other food would be good but don't recommend the chilli crab. Please note I have put the value as poor as the dish did not taste nice for the cost, the rice however did
4
Food was generally good and service was fast and the waitresses are nice. The big bottles of beer were cheap and cold. At 5.95 its a deal!
5
A real gem. Served by Benson who was informative, pleasant and most helpful. Loved the atmosphere and the food was amazing and fantastic value.
4
This is one of the best on our quest for good local food. Some of the other spot have been a bit light on for their desire to wipe off tables. This spot is aware of the tourist but not milking the fact. Very good food well priced (we were traveling with 4 teenagers and at least 2 ate like hungry adults). And nice cold Tiger beer. We are going back - close to the subway entrace to Chinatown.
4
Four of us ate here last week..... Lots of beers and a bottle of wine( expensive in Singapore) plus shared entree and four dishes plus rice ....... $80.00 per couple. Great atmosphere in the middle of market area.... Great for people watching.... Good service.... Would definitely go back again.. Much cheaper than eating along the riverfront
4
Had dinner here on our last night in Singapore. Nice way to end our visit. Excellent place to "people watch" while enjoying a nice meal and drinking the nice inexpensive beer (which can be hard to find in Singapore). Staff were very friendly. Boys, let the ladies do the shopping while you can sit back and enjoy a few cold ones
4
This is a great place for Chilli Crab and a Tiger Beer or two (or three?). Local friends also recommend squid and satays. On our experience, it's hard to see the crab being easily bettered. Note that the service can be a bit on the slow side; very slow when the place was humming. Service aside it's a beaut place to watch the world go by, and only a hop step and jump away from the MRT. On the day we visited we sat through a massive downpour completely unaffected.Will go again next time in Singapore
4
I second Dizzle's comment. Every time I come to Chia Town, I head straight this place with the wrap around corner outside seating. We've eaten here many times and enjoy the satays and chicken rice. The hit for me though is downing the 633ml Tiger Beers and people watching while my bride shops. Pure nirvana
3
This is my favourite place in Singapore, my wife and I seek it out every time we're here. The food is amazing, if a little pricier than surrounding places, and the beer is the coldest you'll find. Sadly the service lets it down, I'd give this place 5 stars otherwise. You'll have a waitress looming over you the second you sit down with a militant "hurry up and order" attitude, then an hour later when you want another beer or the bill you can wave like you're landing a Boeing 747 and the waitress will look everywhere but in your direction. It's like customers are just a massive inconvenience for the staff here. Like I said, a real shame because apart from that this place really is good
4
This is a favourite in china town. A great place to sit on the corner with a beer and some food and watch the world go by... It had been a couple of years since we were last here an the prices seem to have gone up - a meal is no longer cheap here. But the food is still fresh and excellent. The sea food is all live in tanks and their crab remains top draw. My favourite is the sesame baby squid which is to die for and the perfect accompaniment to a cold tiger beer..
4
The first time we went to Chinatown Seafood was way back in 1992 and they were very popular then.  We have been back many times over the years and it is always busy here. Chinatown Seafood is on the corner of Pagoda and Trengganu streets in Chinatown.  The food is also very good and we had had many dishes but the one I really enjoyed was a 1.3 kilo chili mud crab, a bit pricey at S$78 but delicious. They also have cheap bottles of beer, $5.90 for a large bottle!  Chinatown Seafood is perfect for a drink break and a good spot for people watching
4
Had lunch with friends. Black pepper crab. Very fast and efficient. Kinda rushed atmosphere, which was further aggrevated by shoppers using the restaurant as a short cut. You would need to pick a quite corner.
The black pepper crab was great & decently priced.
4
We bought cigars in the private cigar room and then had lunch for this restaurant which is downstairs and owned by the same people.
4
If you are a non-vegetarian and a foodie then this is the place for you, the open air food market has best to offer
2
Second time I have been here and it will be the last time. The restaurant must survive on it's location and cheap beer because the service was awful and the food that we received was average at best. We ended up leaving before all our food had been brought out, after getting our first dish 20 minutes later we still didn't have the rest of our food. No apologize for the awful service just excuses.
5
The place sells great food, service is normally speedy, but getting your change back takes a little longer than necessary. However, I like going here every time I walk through China Town. Great place to meet travelers from around the world and share experiences and culture
5
Almost sure this was the place we all gathered,if it is tasty food and good beer local to all of China town which we absolutely loved,head down this way if your here you will not be disappointed,very safe place i found to be in even thiugh extremely busy
5
My sister and I spent 12 days in Singapre visiting our parents. We ended up here at this restaurant a few times. For one thing, you can get a Tiger Beer for $5 and watch the world go by. This restaurant is right across from the Chinese Heritage Museum, a must see. We loved the spicy green beans and the prawn dish. The servers are really friendly. So much fun in a super casual atmosphere
4
Not bad Chinese food. We have had better in Singapore. It was a little expensive for what else is on offer at other establishments. It was nice to sit, eat and drink and watch the world go by. Don't think we would return. Once was enough. Worth a try though.
3
Located on the corner of Pagoda and Trengganu Streets, this is a great location to eat and watch the world go by. Quite nice food - I had Shrimp Sambal, Vegetables with Oyster Sauce with some rice. Tasty and quick service for the starving (as I was!)
5
This is great restaurant, resonably priced and absolutely delicious.Located in the heart of Chinatown and only around 50M from the MRT station. A huge selection on the menu, with all the Singaporean favorites, including the Chili Crab and Pepper Crab.We tried the Chicken Satay with spicy stir-fried beef, crab fried rice and prawn fritters dipped in egg. All of it was superb and a large Tiger beer was only $5.90, being a tourist, that seems like a bargain.Very happy and very satisfied, the food was superb
4
eat here a couple of times. hige beers only 6ss . good quality and cheap food, meat and seafood. Plus you can people watch from every table.
5
the lowest price for tiger beer and they serve the best chilli crab... don't forget to order some buns with it....
once u are done eating shopping is hardly on any distance :-)
3
5.9$ only. It is good place to have a beer, or two (five). And if this is not 50 characters, then nothing
4
most of the dishes is good as well as chilli crab and black pepper. the restaurant is right on pagoda street as it is busy all day so it would be easy to find. the crab is soooo good but the meat dish is good as well. good choice in Chinatow
4
This is frequented by travellers and you will see many foreigners here. However, saying that, there are locals with them. The food is cheap, I had spicy clams. They weren't really spicy but they surely were tasty. I had them with basil with peanut sauce and chilli. The iced lemon tea as good. You csan people watch as well as people are going through the markets shopping at night
4
We enjoyed Chinatown and found ourselves coming back again & again, so Chinatown Seafood Restaurant became a regular stop! The food was lovely, beer/softdrink icey cold and the service friendly....and of course it's a nice cool place to sit and watch the people go by! Food is reasonably priced as are drinks. Large beer was $5.90 AUD and from memory satay sticks x10 or a serve of wontons $8 for example
5
The Chinatown Seafood Restaurant is a great place for really good seafood at very reasonable prices. We have enjoyed the chilli crab and black pepper crab there a number of times (about S$48 for an 800 gram crab). This time we enjoyed superb razor clams and a fresh lobster, which was brought live to the table for inspection (on special at S$60!) together with a great mixed mushroom starter. With two large bottles of Tiger beer the bill totalled S$120 which was not hard to take.You can shop in the Chinatown emporium and surrounding food stalls and cross over Temple station for terrific massage in the Chinese emoprium building; it really is great part of town. Highly recommended
1
It took them one hour to bring our food! People from other table who came after us were eating already. And we are pissed off because we came first from these people. Food servers are very rude! It ruined our day! We regret eating here. They are too slow and foods are no longer hot when served! HIGHLY NOT RECOMMENDED!!

Ive been to many places in Singapore just to taste their Chili Crabs. Ive visited the famous ones in swanky places and Ive also tried the ones sold at hawkers centers. The Chili Crabs here at Chinatown Seafood Restaurant is so far the best deal Ive had. The taste was great, I think even better than the very popular ones although there is one taste of Chili Crab that really stands out, it the one at Imperial Palace but that will be for a different review. I would not say this is the best tasting in Singapore, because you see its like Kung Fu where every master, student, school would say my kung fu is better than your kung fu and its really hard to say for a fact. So the taste here I think is at the level of great, but what I really really like about this place is the size of the crabs. I have been duped by all, I mean all the other restaurants that I have tried in Singapore served me their 1kg size or 1.2Kg or 1,5kg when I know for a fact its not even 1kg. Maybe if they included the sauce and all it would weigh a kilo. Im a fanatic when it comes to Chili Crabs and I know just by looking at the crab how heavy that would have been before it was cooked. So I was really very happy when I saw this humongous claws and big carapace served on a platter that I was getting the real 1.2 kg crab. The value for money does not stop there. This is the only place where I experienced eating crabs that are so fat, I mean full of the fatty goodness embedded inside the shell. Ive never experienced that in other restaurants in Singapore so when I saw those red-orange chunks of cooked crab fat I knew I was in for a great feast. The sauce was good, the buns were hot and overall I think I have no complaints what so ever about the quality and the size of the chili crab served. I was smiling from ear to ear after eating. The dining area is big, it has the same set-up as a food hawker center but I think it might be hot and humid during the day as they have a lot of electric fans placed around the dining area. We ate there at night and it was raining so the temperature was ok. The service was fast, you can ask how the chili crab could be cooked - you want it extra spicy or just mildly spicy and they will adjust the chili factor. They also serve other dishes from fish to prawns and I think also chicken. The place was packed but it seems that people really go there just to eat and leave after the meal and wander around Chinatown for other bargain treats, so you can wait for a short time to get a table

I've been eating on this corner since 2003, every time I've stopped over in Singapore. I used to look forward to the cheap but good quality meals served here, but not so now. The Chinatown Seafood Restaurant has gradually pushed the previous restaurant out (Wan Tang Eating House), first pushing it next door before totally taking over. In the process, the food quality is now poor and the service is not any better. Yes, the beer is cold and ok.We went here twice on the 25th March 2012 and on the way home on the 5th April 2012. Both times, crab shells in our rice, dry/cheap ingredients and the food is now expensive. On the last occasion, they totally forgot the main course we ordered.Unfortunately this location is not a good one for quality meals. The street vendors have more to offer. If you're looking for a rough and ready place to watch the football from and just have a beer, it's ok as you have three big screens
