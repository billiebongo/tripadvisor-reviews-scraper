Go there for cocktails as they have a wide range of the staple cocktails plus also a lot of Asian cocktails. Nothing beats sipping a cocktail on the waterfront

Our group of four enjoyed a super meal overlooking the river at Clarke Quay. The street food based menu was great and the atmosphere superb. The staff were professional, helpful and friendly.
4
We sat in the outside section adjacent to the Singapore River but seating is also available inside with air conditioned comfort. We had the prawn entrees and Pork Belly main course which were all delicious. Would certainly visit again.
5
We had a very tasty meal here. Nice views of river. Service was very attentive. Better than many other places. Prices were Ok.
3
Slow service from uninterested staff, the tables were put so close together with chairs so big you got wedged into your seat by the table behind you. Not a great experience
2
We decide to give this restaurant a try but was a bad choice. We are from India so my review is more relevant for people with taste buds from my country.We order a chicken dish which was average. We also order fresh spring rolls which were very close to inedible. The rice also tasted stale. I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone
5
Nice well located Vietnamese restaurant in Clarke Quay. When we sat down I was surprised to find it was Vietnamese. (I put that down to jet lag not age). Food was very good apart from crispy squid. and portion size and price such that a couple could order a variety of dishes comfortably and not pay too much. Drinks seemed surprisingly cheap by Singapore standards. Clarke quay feels busier than boat quay with more bars bands and tourists but still a good spot. Service good and friendly
4
Sat outside with a river view. Ate deep fried squid, whitebait, chicken and prawn salad, Chicken and Prawn spring rolls and Vietnamese fried rice with a beer and a glass of wine. Came to $84 incl 10% service charge and 7% tax. The whole meal was very tasty and we probably ordered too much as we were full at the end. I dropped a Knife on the floor and it was replaced instantly. Great view from the table of river life but get there early or it will be full
4
So I visited here with some friends, one of whom was Vietnamese, and wanted to introduce us to good Vietnamese food.While I am no expert on the authenticity (he was a tad bit disappointed on that account), I can definitely say, that the food was really good !I went for a duck breast dish - that was really tender and juicy ! The serving portions are also ok ; The ambiance adds to the charm of the place, and i found the place comforting :-). A note though - if you plan a weekend visit, do try to get in early (7-ish) or it would be a challenge getting a table ! Happy Dining 
4
Sitting by the river on a Friday evening enjoying the happy hour cocktails at Little Saigon is wonderful! The food was very good too, and I think going for a platter is the best idea if you're looking for nibbles to off-set the (very) alcoholic cocktails
5
Great view and excellent food. Ordered the baby squid fried was really good. Service was quick and overall a great spot for Vietnamese food
1
Very overpriced for what they serve you. My Food came out cold and than had to wait another 20 mins for my wifeâ€™s food to arrive. Would not recommend.
1
Don't try half dozen tray of drinks. You' ll get expensive juice. No taste of alcohol. Lovely taste of lemon Juice, nothing else.
4
Good location good food good drinks good service. In an area where you are spoilt for choice we were not disappointed. Go early and get get half price cocktails and food
3
First al fresco dinner at Clarke Quay and first visit to Little Saigon. Amazing view of Singapore river at night and good atmosphere. However food is average. We tried most of the Chef's recommendations but only impressed with dishes Pan Fried Snapper and Vietnamese drip coffee.
5
Clarke Quay is a nighttime entertainment hub in Singapore - a must visit whether just to stroll or to eat. We spent five days in Singapore and ate at both ends of the scale - some good, some shockers. Little Saigon was a standout. The service, the ambiance, the food and the menu - excellent. We really enjoyed our meal there.Ozdreame
5
Not just the food are good, the atmosphere and the customer services are excellent! The place is totally suitable for chill outs with friends, together with a couple of cold beer. Alcohol is very affordable! It's a must to go! A pity there's a charge of premium water, no tap water for sale
4
I just ordered take away but will definitely come back for a full meal. I needed something to eat fast but had to be tasty. Being tired of Clarke Quay's same same, this restaurant is an amazing surprise. I ordered the prawn & pork fresh spring rolls and a beef & starfruit salad. They were both fresh, very well seasoned and delicious. Staff very friendly and the order took less than 10 minutes to be ready. Not cheap but doesn't break the bank. Totally worth it
1
We knew that dining in a touristy area like Clarke Quay was going to be risky, and as such researched where to go and found several recommendations to try this place. It started well enough, we were given a lovely table with water views and were told it was happy hour on alcoholic drinks. We indulged in a cocktail, and treated the kids to a mocktail (incidentally, this ended up costing more without the alcohol!). We ordered a selection of plates - satay sticks, duck, fish and some prawn thing. We were firstly disappointed at the serving size - 3 satay sticks for $14, 3 prawns for about the same. After tasting the plates, there was some relief that there was not more to eat. It was the worst food we had ever eaten in a restaurant. And the most expensive, for what it was. The duck was rubbery, prawns inedible and the fried rice bland. The noodle salad was probably the only thing that wasn't too bad. We had ordered a baguette for our 3 year old who doesn't like spicy food. We had to remind the waitperson that this hadn't come out, and I wish we hadn't as it had been nuked to an inch of it's life. Once we had our food there was no service, and the waitperson avoided eye contact as we went up to pay. No exchange of words was given, and both us and the lady knew why. No water view is worth this experience. The food halls and hawkers markets are far superior in quality and experience than this place
3
One of several bars that serve food and drink along the river at Claire's Quay. Drink offerings a bit limited and come at a premium because of where you are. There are promotions and happy hours to lessen the hit. Food looks ok although I only stopped for drinks. It's as good as anywhere else if you want a drink at Clarke Quay but there are better places to entertain yourself in Singapor
2
Not sure how this made the top 10. Food was very average and service rubbish. Really disappointed after going out of our way to find it after the so called great reviews. You can do a lot better elsewhere.
5
Well done guys words cannot express. Just the most wonderful Friday night ever. Wonderful staff great food extensive selection of beverage. Brilliant band tackling some of the greatest hits ever played like the pro's. Small but rocking. Keep it up guys and all the best.
5
Great little restaurant overlooking the river Happy hour great cocktails best place to watch the river boats lovely staff End of a long day visiting Singapore it's well worth a visit
3
Clark quay is a food haven and little Saigon is a decent Vietnamese option. They try and create a good local cuisine in Singapore and have a good options in menu.
Good to visit
3
the beer is cheap here but the service is distinctly average . food is ok but there are much better Vietnamese restaurants in Singapore
4
Walking looking for some where to eat & found Little Saigon had many people seated so thought this must be good & it was, food was tasty Vietnamese, price mid range with good drink prices & we were moved to a table near the river which was a delight
5
This was undoubtedly the best all round restaurant we visited in Singapore. The location on the riverside, ambience, awesome, Vietnamese food and half price cocktails till 9pm. One of the best long island tea and Maithai tasted. Do yourself a favor and try it...tip...get there around 7pm for a good seat and ample time for those great value cocktails (about $8.50 sing @ happy hour
1
Went to little Saigon, looked good but after 2 drinks, over a hour we still didn't have our food but other tables that came in after and ordered the same food had theirs!. When. We asked about our meal we received a complementary serve of spring rolls but after another 20. Min left without our meal.This place is second rate and not worth a visit
2
After being gone for three years, I returned to Clark Quay for business and the office suggested this place for dinner and drinks. Cold erdinger on tap and great outdoor seating made for a great happy hour with appetizers. They took our memos and we had to ask for them back to order dinner. The servers must have changed because the service turned poor and they started messing up. It took 30 minutes for 4 drinks so I had to go to the bar. Not sure he looks come bac
2
We came here because HubgryGoWhere recommended this place as TOP 5 Vietnamese place to go.We have ordered a bahn mi and three other dishes.The bahn me certainly was not as nice as we used to in Vietnam. Certainly does not taste authentic to me. The other three dishes came out cold from the kitchen. They've tasted ok.They don't serve ice water....in singaporean terms this is certainly also unacceptable.
3
Has a very nice view on the river, that was the best part. Otherwise I found the food quite ordinary, especially for the price. Also the waitress messed up my order. I guess it's to be expected in such a touristy area.
5
Drinks were cheap and good during happy hour. Waitress service was good. Food was awesome too if you liked Vietnam food. Great place to hang out with friends.
3
Little Saigon serves almost-Vietnamese food, meaning it's not quite so. Actually, the food is average plus. Rather spend your dimes on the cocktails which are actuallu quite good!
4
On Clarke Quay within earshot of 3, possibly more, excellent acoustic sets in this totally brilliant area of Singapore. Can't help but regret that London's not being allowed to live in such a beautiful way right now though. We will again!Food in Little Saigon was delicious and good portions to boot. Happy hour where drinks were 50% off rather than 241 was very good - waitress came round each table before it ended to ask if more drinks were required, which I thought was a nice touch. Ambiance tremendous, even when dining solo - which makes a pleasant change. Good experience and one you must try if you're on the patch.
1
Had dinner here last night with friends and ordered beef rice paper rolls which were very chewy. I have made better ones myself. The sauce that came with if had an overwhelming fish taste which made me gag. My friends ordered papaya salad and asked for the peanuts on the side due to her allergy and put the dressing on the side instead.. therefore we returned the dish. The salad itself was very bland and nor fresh. We live our Vietnamese food but this was probably the worst I've ever tasted
5
Inside seating area is little as its name but it targets to different types of customer. If you love the music (those classic or trendy pop songs), you should not miss one of those nights when the band is on. The vocal male lead has beautiful voice that some guy on the performance bar "Le Noir" nearby cannot beat. They are attentive and patient to your requests. So prepare your own list and get them sing along for you. Cocktails were fine, typical prices ($$) for food and beverage along the Clarke Quay. If you don't feel like squeezing yourself in one of the inside tables chilling with the music, they have an open seating space overlooking the river. Some people complained their service was poor, but I would say depending on where you are seated. Outside seating area has great dinning atmosphere with fast service and friendly staff. After get yourself stuffed, come in for a few more drinks and enjoy the band. I guess that's the ideas of the owner but some people just don't get it. After all, we just fell in love with the decor of this little bar, the music and the band's friendliness. Look forward to be back <
1
After we sat down different staff came back every minute to check if we are ready to order. We felt it too pushy. When they took the order, they didn't write it down. No wonder they messed up the order and bring something else. We also ordered 4 spring rolls (so two sets of two) but they brought only 1 set. The pho is quite big but there are much more authentic ones in town for half the price.
4
Stopping by the bar we first thought it was unoccupied but soon found that once the local band started playing the restaurant filled to capacity. The food was very good and nicely not too Western with a good selection of cocktails.The band was excellent and really was the highlight. Great rapport with the patrons and not too loud they really had the patrons singing out loud.Overall a very worthwhile visit
4
After wandering around a few places at Clarke Quay, we ended up at Little Saigon as the place was almost empty. We heard a band playing a nice tune from Ed Sheeran and the ambience was romantic. The band plays songs that are easy to the ears with good melody. The place serve Vietnamese food and there is an outdoor seats with riverfront view. A good place to unwind after the long exhausting week
5
Excellent location in s very buzzing area. Super cocktails, we had, lime daiquiri and a moijto . Super food of steamed prawns and pork roll and stir fried prawns in a wonderful sauce. We then had grilled prawns with rice with chilli crab sauce and mixed veg, all delicious p, service was very friendly and efficient a rareity I have found in Singapore. Average price for Singapore. Would definitely return
5
Went here with my boyfriend during happy hour. Ended up staying long after it ended. Had really nice food, cocktails and beer. Beautiful views over the river from the deck seating area. Would definitely return, and recommend anyone visiting Singapore to visits this little place!
3
Had a late lunch here after a lovely Sunday in Singapore,the staff were friendly ,and a nice place by the river, the food was ok ,but drinks are expensive, overall would go back again
3
This is situated in a nice area down Clark Quay. Has both indoor and outdoor restaurant area.The food was very tasty. We ordered platters which are very economical. The staff was not good. They were not friendly ,they dont help wiith menus either . They are rude.Average food cost per person is around SGD5
4
Located right on the Quayside (with good night time views of the Laser show from the Marina Bay Sands if your facing the right direction). Great food and service, price wise it is inline with others in clarke quay. Would go early as seemed to get busy but did not feel rushed to vacate table
1
During night time, dont try to came into his reataurant, as the servers, assistants and the whole team was juat dont bother whethe tourists want to having there or take it away. Unpleasant and bad attitude. Its just like we eat freely in the restaurant without paying anything. Better try other restaurant around the area which have more pleasant crew and servers than this reataurant! Food also not top good and standard taste. Not worthy at all
3
6 of us ate here and we found the food to have small portions, very expensive drinks and the food quite tasteless. Whilst the restaurant is located on the river in Clarke Quay, in a wonderful setting, the restaurant was a real let down. Having just finished a tour in Vietnam, the food wasn't authentic in the slightest.I did expect to pay high prices for food in this area, but what they charged for the amount of food and drinks was very disappointing
4
I had gone out with a friend for dinner. The food was nice and the drinks were also great. We had the platter and mango mojito. Sitting close to the river made the evening more pleasant. I would recommend this place to hang out in the evening. Do try to go in early and take a table closest tot he river. Their happy hours are great so make the most of it...enjoy some of their delicious cocktails
4
Come early for dinner or reserve the tables closest to the river. Besides good food, they serve delicious cocktail drinks for half the price during happy hours. Suggestion: Try the Singapore Sling or Mango margheritta Or get the lunch special during Sun-thurs. It's really woth it
1
Food was below average. they had a dip which was sweeter then dessert. Duck was chewy, chicken was stale. I would avoid going there again. Prices are not very low for this kind of food. Ok to have drink but they served glasses with one of them having lipstick marks on it !
4
Stopped off for a late lunch on our way back to our hotel after having a day out in Singapore, and popped into Little Saigon, we only wanted a quick and easy lunch so we had beers and sandwiches, (clubs), they came with loads of meat and salad in them and were really filling, we would had tried this place for dinner had we not been on our last day in Singapore
3
First the positives: the staff were friendly, and the location is great. The best dish were the spring rolls
now the negatives: the stuffed squid had little taste, and strange texture. The whitebait was overdone
If you want authentic vietnamese food, this is not it
3
Good service. Poor imitation of Vietnamese food. Expensive however the location is very good. Would not go back.
2
Dropped by at random and was not a great experience. Food was very average, particularly for the price - sugarcane pawns were rubbery, pho was bland and fried spring rolls were not crispy.
Service was good and location is great, right on the quay.
5
With a nice outside terrace on the border of the water . You enjoy delicious food ,well presented while drinking lovely cocktails . Before 9.00 pm it's happy hour !!!!. Prime location to enjoy the lights on Clark quay .
5
The live band plays very good music.It has a very good outdoor sitting by the water. Drinks can be a little bit more expensive.
5
So good I went here two nights in a row. The duck is to DIE for! If you get the lemon grass mocktaill, maybe get it without brown sugar as it's really sweet. The second night I got it without and it was heaven! Also, the price isn't bad for what you get and the location cannot be beat.
5
My husband and I visited Little Saigon a few times during our stay in Singapore. We enjoyed some very nice Vietnamese cuisine and loved the Happy hour!The setting is lovely by the rive in Clarke Quay and this is definitely one of our favourite spots
4
We dropped in as we were passing for dinner. Service was friendly and efficient. Food was delicious, half price cocktails, beers and house wine before 9pm. Would recommend sitting out by the river- was raining hard but we were kept fully dry so could enjoy the atmosphere.
2
Not a place to entertain if looking for a decent vietnamese restaurant. its too noisy and the menu is not legible in the dim lighting. the food is basic fare but with a beer or two can be expensive. having said all that if you are young and looking for a few drinks and something to soak the alcohol with accompanied by the music from surrounding venues, then this is likely to fit the bill
4
Quaint little place along Clarke Quay facing the river, it offers nice food, with a standard spread of drinks. What makes it attractive is the small cozy space it is tucked in and the tiny stage that allows the live band to be very close and intimate with the audience
3
Restaurant served flat soft drink, poor product knowledge and lack of positive attitude. Require more training to win repeat businesses.
4
Vietnamese restaurant right by the river, the setting is really nice, service was good and food was ok, live music playing so pretty lively and a nice place for dinner
5
Small inside area but food is excellent and staff is friendly. Good live music and nice selection after band is finished
4
First night in Singapore, got there late & went walking to find out as much as we could.Couldn't make a decision & walked into Little Saigon at Clarke Quay. Many bars & restaurants to choose from. Friendly happy staff, with good service & very good food.The prawn entrÃ©e was fantastic & the rest was pretty good too.Went back a couple of nights later.Long happy hour for cocktails
4
Went on a busy Friday night but didn't have to wait for a table, prices are reasonable considering the location. We managed to hit happy hour also which helped with the price of drinks. Polite and attentive staff. Food was out quick and it was very tasty. We had a noodle dish and a rice dish along with some fresh rice paper rolls. We were not disappointed. It is very limited up there, as lots going on around but that didn't spoil anything
3
My overall rating is average because food in Singapore is so good in so many places I have become a little picky. I had spring rolls as well as the chili prawns. Good taste, good service and location. I had a mango mojito that was EXCELLENT. For sure this is nice place to drink, socialize, and people watch. Most of the menu is sandwiches and street food. I can easily recommend this place
3
We tried Little Saigon because they appeared to be ready for lunch. The drinks and food were served quickly. I wanted one last Singapore Sling but it was rather sweet so the drink were not noteworthy. However the salads were very tasty and plentiful. (We typically went with lighter meals at lunchtime if we were eating outside.) We also ordered the sauteed prawns which were very tasty
3
We ate dinner and enjoyed sitting outside, watching the crowds pass by and eat Vietnamese food ( we had spring rolls and rice dish )The service personnel is friendly and fast.The food tasted good. Prices are mid-range, just like most restaurants in the area
4
After a Singapore River cruise I wandered into Little Saigon restaurant on the boardwalk beside the river.I dined at an outside table by the river - the gentle breeze was cool and welcome after a warm day touring around.Enjoyed fried pork rolls,,,,very thin skins - for entrÃ©e and the starfruit beef salad with a tiger beer, ending the meal with a traditional Vietnamese coffee and banana sticky rice.A nice meal - worth a visit
3
Location: The restaurant is located by the river â€“ there is both an internal and external part to the restaurant. The external part is a lot larger and overlooks where the water taxis turn around. The external part does have some fans but they are poorly distributed and pretty ineffective. There are also some lanterns which are positioned so you keep hitting your head on them at certain tables.Food: The food was okay: the spring rolls were a bit bland; the prawns and chicken wings were okay, the duck and fried rice were good.Other: The restaurant itself has no toilets and you have to rely on the public toilets which are air conditioned but not very clean
4
Nice little place on the water. We saw part of the laser show from our table. We enjoy watching the boats on the water. The food was good and the service was very good.
2
Nice location but full of tourists and very busy. Service is about as good as the food, the 'fresh' spring rolls were small and soggy.
It was an unpleasant experience.
5
We enjoyed Happy Hour drinks here three nights during our stay and found them to be value-for-money, including my Pina Colada. We also enjoyed snacks here, all the while watching the action on the river and people-watching the passers by on the Quay.
4
we sat outside on a busy Friday evening. not all tables have fans facing them, so that was a downer, as the weather was humid as always.We had veg fried rice with omlette which was pretty good . Vermicelli salad was good as well. Fried pho noodles were okayish. All in all, a decent Thai option in Clarke Quay. worth a visit
2
The restaurant is well positioned on the water at Clarke Quay however thats the best part of this restaurant. Staff were not exactly rude but certainly not friendly. Food was distinctly average tasting and very rushed with our main courses arriving just as we finished our starters. Overall quiet expensive for the experience I certainly wouldn't go back or recommend it
3
I went there with my wife and 9 year old daughter.The half price beer was good, but that is the same in all the restaurants along Clarke Quay.My wife and daughter had Pho which they said was good.I had the Bahn Mi (Vietnamese baguette) with roast chicken.The baguette was stale and the whole thing was drowned in Mayonnaise (which is very un-Vietnamese). All I could taste was stale bread and mayo. the rest could have been anything at all.I sent it back and they refunded the cost.They did also offer to make me another, but I was not convinced it would be any better (especially if the bread was all stale) so I declined
4
We made this our first stop to eat after arriving from an 7 hour flight .It has a very scenic view of the river and buildings , which is even more pleasant after dark with the multi coloured lights all around .We ordered the fried rice noodles and seafood and weren't disappointed with the flavour or serving size .The dish was possibly a little spicy for the average vacationer , but very tasty none the less .The half price cocktails were a bargain as well 
5
We enjoyed our cocktails, and they surprised us when we got the bill, it's happy hour! So, we paid only 50% by then! Whoa what a great value for money! And also the view was great, it's beside the river. The temperatur there was quite hot, but yeah this is Singapore! :
5
myself as a tourist who had visited most of the country in Asia but this live bad was the best band ever (The E.N.T), but please sing more classic song next time when i visit there ya. restaurant seat are limited make sure you go early to reserve better seat for ya. nice food and cheap beer as well. Thanks to the management. T
5
We enjoyed strolling along Clarke Quay and ended up at Little Saigon for dinner. It was a lovely setting on the deck overlooking the river. The food was reasonably priced for the area and we all enjoyed our meals. A good variety to choose from which catered to everyone in our group. We all enjoyed our food and would eat here again. Happy hour went to 9.00pm so drinks were reasonable
2
I went to there for a dinner.
Got a duck with rise that probably was prepared earlier and heated in microwave for me.
Was very disappointing.
I've got a creme brulee for desert, this one was good.
5
Enjoyed a superb meal at Little Saigon, service was good and attentive without being overbearing.
Can highly recommend the following - Grilled Prawns with chilli crab sauce, chicken wings and the Vietnamese minced beef.
4
As a.lone traveller I had a nice meal and enjoyed the atmosphere of the Clarke Quay area. Staff were friendly and attentive. Food had a bit of something for everyone, drinks, snacks or meals. Lots of choice in the.area and this.one is worth choosing.
4
As part of our anniversary trip we came here for drinks, great cocktails, friendly staff awesome band (Friday night)
1
Small servings
Worst pho ga I ever had (e.g.it had eggs which was not indicated on the menu)
Tiger beer from the keg tasted very old too.
Overall paid a lot of money for crappy food.
1
Stopped at Little Saigon for early dinner. Young sour faced waitress with attitude treated my wife with arrogance and contempt while taking the order. After she moved to the reception she started laughing with the senior staff and making faces directed at my wife. My wife understandably got angry. The senior lady tried to say that they were not laughing at her . As we walked out the senior person started laughing. I have never experienced such disrespect and rudeness in Singapore in 20 years of trave
2
This place has been geared towards western Vietnamese, the menu is less traditional and has a variety of fried options. Most probably the most expensive meal we had in our whole time in Singapore and certainly not the best. What it does have going for it is the location at Clarke Quay and you can watch the boats come and go during your time eating and the laser show from the Marina Bay Sands. Overall disappointed and was attracted by the 50% off cocktail
1
We looked at the top 10 restaurant to eat in Singapore and Little Saigon was rated number 1 , so we went and ordered 2 beers and spring rolls ( that suppose to be their signature). Spring rolls stunk and the shrimps tastes rotten we almost throw up. We called the manager and its like nothing happened so we paid the beers and left. No apology, No waving the beer cost, no nothing
3
We were served by this man whose well versed with the menu and is helpful to recommend to us. He even shared with us about his gf and that she's into skincare business. The mango mojito is delicious but overall, the food is just average. The fresh spring rolls is quite a disappointment & the beef soup is too peppery and have lots of ajinomoto (we kept on drinking water). I must say the platter is the best out of all the dishes served. Would I come again? Probably no
5
we called in to Little Saigon at Clarke Quay to take a break from the heat and have a cold drink and both these requests were fulfilled at Little Saigon. The beer is served in huge, tall glasses and is icy cold. My fruit juice was freshly squeezed and delicious. We bumped into fellow Aussies and enjoyed drinks and a friendly chat. What more could anyone want
4
Nice cold Tiger beers at happy hour prices, free Wi-fi, good food and very friendly non pushy service, perfect view of river.
3
Great presentation of food and it taste equally good but the indoor seats are all high chairs and the outdoor area is lacking ventilation. Would return only on a cold windy night.
5
Fine Dining at this Clarke Quay Restaurant. Indoor and outdoor dining on the banks of Clarke Quay. Good food and value for money. Comprehensive menu.
3
The view next to river is lovely and the happy hour for cocktails and beers is quite convenient! However, the food was quite disappointing, probably one of the worst vietnamese meal we had in Singapore.
2
Went for happy hour drinks. Very average. Gave us the menus and watched over us until we ordered. Cocktails tasted pretty watery, not very strong and flavourful. Paid the bill and 15 minutes later had to ask as the change hadn't come back.
4
Had a lovely meal hear, noodles were spot on, music coming from next door helped..
Very reasonably priced and staff seemed polite and courteous..
5
Fantastic little restaurant small and quaint - whenever I head to Singapore I go here, great food, reasonable drinks (for Singapore) and the resident band are usually up on stage performing - great sound and love to take requests.
3
Nothing special but not bad.
Right on the water so nice but food is average
I would have expected a better quality food but no negative points.
Staff was very friendly
4
The food is good, had an excellent veggie banh mi with fried tofu.The drinks deals, especially on a Saturday night when there are few places with deals, is great 241 before 9pm. The Bull Frog will be a great starter to any night! Cheap, strong and fairly tasty!I would recommend Little Saigo
3
Be prepared to pay for water. You can find much better in Singapore. We thought we ordered a beef noodle soup and a tiny soup arrived without noodle. After waiting for another 20min we received the beef noodle soup. Fried rice is also not the typical fried rice but more like chicken rice.
4
Good location with outside seating on the river. Long happy hour with all drinks half price. Friendly and helpful. Good vibe. Did not eat so cannot comment but menu more light meals.
5
This place is great if you want to have some drinks and listen to live music. The band was good and asked us to suggest songs.
5
Loved this place so much we went two days in a row! The chips with curry mayonnaise are the best I've ever eaten in my life, the platter to share was fantastic too! Great location, great atmosphere. Will definitely go back! Also great happy hour!
4
Great place to come if you like Vietnamese food, Great service and live music. Reasonable price and good portions. We had so much fun here .
5
Possibly the best combination of flavours I've ever eaten! Have never left a restaurant feeling so wowed by food! And such a beautiful location!
4
If taking light menus, very good price-quality. The beef-sandwich was very tender. The duck too. Drinks bit expensive. But the sticky banana dessert is delicious. I did read comments on staff being bit rude. Not at all. Quite friendly. It's a matter to be friendly at them too. It's busy place, so they're busy. But we had nice little conversation. Place to recommend.
3
Went for dinner at around 730pm, and decided to have a table inside the restaurant. Initially, the staff wanted the 4 of us to share a table that is barely big enough for 2. After some convincing, we managed to get the staff to join 2 tables together for us. The food was decent however their drinks menu is on the pricier side. Asked for tap water but they only serve bottled water. Their live band was good. Worth a visit but have your drinks somewhere else
5
Thought I would be condemned to European style steak in Singapore to eat gf safely. Then OH happened to check the menu while we were drinking a Singapore Sling half price in happy hour. The waitress gets it and has a list under the counter of safe food. Prawns and ginger. Delicious. Google had suggested was tricky for me to eat here. Cried with joy. And got upgraded at a riverside table
3
The place has very nice atmosphere. They have an amazing offer here when you come early with discounted drinks. The staff here however is quite rude and they don't repeat the order of the customer, and also the food take extremely long time to arrive. On top of that, there's nothing else to complain about
3
Had dinner in the outside terrace. Staff was not so nice, no smiles, a bit rude. One waiter while serving dropped a chili sauce over my phone and some documents I had on the table and I had to insist to have him clean up the mess. Nice Food at fair price, but beer prices are too high, 30 % over the average of Clarke Quay.

To be honest, I have never eaten here before, I have only had late night drinks here. The live band that plays here is amazing! Drinks although slightly pricey taste good and I have nothing to complain about!

Located on the riverside in Clarke Quay, this Vietnamese restaurant has a nice atmosphere and tasty cuisine. The prices's are in line with most restaurants along the Quay. The staff were friendly and attentive enough.
4
Located adjacent to the waterside we enjoyed the outlook and the food and staff were good too. Recommeded

This restaurant is right on the river at Clarke Quay. The food was very good, but it only had a limited menu. I would have liked more choice. Also we asked for a glass of water and were told we could only buy it by the bottle. Make sure you go early to take advantage of the happy hour deal. Otherwise even a glass of house wine will be $1

Went there on our last night in Singapore for dinner. We were seating just near the river : beautiful view!The staff who took our drinks order was a bit rude being really abrupt and not smiling but other than that the food was great!Good value for money : from 4pm to 9pm they have 50% drinks
1
The staff is very rude and very confrontational. We were drinking with friends and because a couple didn't order a beer we were told to leave when more people arrived. I guess they don't want business? In this day and age you have to understand that some people are not drinking alcohol... And in a party of 10 people they had plenty of business. If you can skip this place for common decency of asking for friendly and understanding service that don't put their hands in your face if they have an issue with you relaxing with friends please do

Little Saigon is one of the restaurants in Clarke Quay which has a sitting out area over the Singapore River and we took a table for four on that space and thoroughly enjoyed the evening. Two of us being vegetarians we found ourselves ordering 3 of the 4 suitable things on the whole menu which seemed a bit light in terms of choice but in fairness each was lovely so that was a good thing
3
Nice place to have a drink and some Asian food. The terras is next to the river with a light wind on a warm night this is the place to be. The service staff is friendly. The food it self tastes good but is little overpriced
4
Ate here yesterday afternoon - wanted to eat late afternoon before heading off the the Night Safari and found most other paces closed.Happy hour was a bonus and we made the most of the half price cocktails with our meal.Fantastic chicken wings. Spring rolls really good. Noodles and fried rice also enjoyable.Not a wide variety of Vietnamese food on the menu but a really enjoyable meal none the less
1
My husband and I ate here last night. I don't believe these people know what Vietnamese food is supposed to look or taste like. We ordered fried spring rolls, which were soggy and only partially cooked, and sugar cane prawns, which were unrecognizable as prawn meat. They were hard, tough and tasteless. Our next dish was lemongrass tenderloin beef, which was a plate of grey, almost tasteless meat with no sauce, and a mound of rice. Happy hour is a joke unless you're drinking beer. I ordered a cocktail which had little or no alcohol in it. Overall a very expensive and unappetising dinner. We have eaten these foods all over Vietnam and in Melbourne and have never eaten anything so disgusting
4
Great atmosphere (Saturday night). Happy hour cocktails followed by excellent food right in the heart of Clarke Quay - would definitely recommend.
4
Within close walking proximity of the Park Regis in Singapore! A great restaurant with good views of the casino and the river, as well as awesome cost effective food!
Very enjoyable and recommended!
4
We had a great afternoon at Little Saigon. We tried their signature Pho Bo and we absolutely loved it. The restaurant is located in Clark Quay so basically, they have one of the nicest places to hangout.
5
As soon as i arrive in Singapore i go searching for noodles and none do it better than Little Siagon Asia at Clarke Quay... not to mention great cocktails during happy hour... the staff are great and all the guests are relaxed... i keep coming back time and agai
5
Happy hour is the big draw in Clark Quay and for us as non beer drinkers we were looking for options. Little Saigon has nearly their full list of cocktails for half price, which are also reasonably priced (for Singapore...) in the first place and delicious. Food is also excellent we ate several appetizers over a couple of visits
4
We went here on the recommendation of our son. Went during happy hour which always makes for a nice time. Located on the river and sat next to it with views down the river to the business district. Food was extremely nice, well cooked and well presented.Service was impeccable and we were not rushed at all. In all a great place to eat in a great location with authentic food
4
The food at Little Saigon is very tasty and portion sizes are fair. For some reason the prices of soft drinks and beer are extremely high. The evening atmosphere is great, overlooking the river and with live music. Service is friendly but could be more efficient as regards serving all main dishes at the same time. After all, a pleasant evening.
5
I've been eating here for about 6 out of 14 days in Singapore and keep coming back for more . I've tried almost all the menu and everything is delicious.My one and only complaint is the Pho Bo soup. I felt it could of used a little more flavor as it was a little bland. I'm sure it could of been an off night .Food serving is appropriate for Singapore and price about matches most other places.Be sure to come at happy hour as beer prices in Singapore tend to be expensive.Overall a great experience and would recommend
4
Little Saigon is in two parts, there indoors where they have a bar, tables and the band and outdoors where you can sit on the banks of the river. Personally I like indoors because they music is usually very good but itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s still nice to sit outside and dine on some tasty Vietnamese food (or if you want there are some western dishes too) and watch the world go by. The staff are friendly and service is good. However the place is a bit pricey but then again so is the entire Clarke Quay areas when Little Saigon is situated
1
Well three of us where here and surrounding was nice. Was very crowded and humid.The server said - "we dont serve water we sell water" harshly!! Mind it water is free to drink everywhere for free in singapore.Then we got three cocktails. Those were more water than alcohols and i am sorry to say i might be visiting here again.The live band was excellent though
4
Touristy location on the river but service was prompt, polite and efficient. Food was tasty and value for money. Drinks are very expensive but half price during a 5 hour happy hour period, still pricy though.
5
Here's our menu: Frogs Legs $14, Pork Ribs $20, Sugar Cane Prawns $14, washed down with two pints of Tiger Beer. Total cost of $75, including taxes. All prices in Singapore dollars. If you're not happy with that, you can.....go forth and multiply.
2
Arrived at about 8.45pm on a Saturday night, and waitress was prompt to inform us of the ending of Happy Hour for drinks. We ordered cocktails but the alcohol content was very low compared to cocktails at other bars and restaurants.The food took extremely long to arrive. We were told that waiting time would be 30 minutes but ended up waiting for almost an hour.We ordered the party platter, costing $45, but none of the items were any good. The spring rolls were soggy, calamari was overcooked and rubbery and prawns were cold.We also ordered individual portions of meat, none of which were particular impressive. These dishes cost about $20 each. Overall the food is very expensive and standard is poor.The only positive thing was the live music, which all my friends enjoyed thoroughly
2
Not really impressed. Have the menu was not available and the cocktails were expensive but served in normal cold drink glasses. Our waiter was great but was not supported well from management. Disappointed.

I was invited to the 3rd anniversary of Little Saigon at Clarke Quay. There is a high turnover of restaurants and F&B outlets at Clarke Quay, and this is commendable. The party was in full swing when we arrived. We managed to find a table to sit. Lucky usÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ The food were spread out across two stations and there were also roving servers to serve light bites to the guests. For the food, we had the following:- Tahu Goreng: Fried bean curd. This was topped with fried shallots and cut spring onions and onions. Served with a tangy Vietnamese Chilli dip. Not bad.- Mini-sliders: Sliced beef (normally used in Pho) were cooked and placed between crispy mini mantou. with lettuce and mini tomato. Its good! - Meat Ball: This came with a tomato based sauce. The meatballs were tasty. - Fish Cutlets with mayonnaise: The fish were coated with batter and fried. Its served with a dollop of flavoured mayonnaise which complemented the fish well. Its good! - Vietnamese Rice Rolls: Lettuce, vermicelli, cucumber slices and prawns wrapped in a rice paper. Nice. - Prawns on sugarcane stick: Freshly grilled and served with a nice dip. Good. - Noodles with grilled chicken: Thick vermicelli with bean sprouts served dry and I topped it up with grilled chicken slices, peanuts, coriander and mint leaves. This filled me up nicely. Drinks-wise, juices, red and white wines, Heineken Beer and cocktails were available. I especially like the sparkling wine cocktail, which was nice and refreshing. Several live bands performed for the evening and guests had a great time. I did too. Congrats, Little Saigon on your third anniversary
5
Unfortunately we didn't eat in this place, only stayed for few drinks and listened to the amazing live band ENT. We only meant to stay for a quick drink, but it was the band that kept us there - they play every day of the week and if you're in Singapore go and check them out before they are discovered by a talent scout. Great drinks, great atmosphere, great place
1
We dined here this evening on our 1st night in Singapore. The food lacked flavour and I hardly ate any of my Saigon Chicken... The sticky rice was tasteless. For the price I would expect a lot better. We had to go and eat somewhere else afterwards as we were not satisfied and still hungry. Furthermore, the service was terrible, no one cleared our plates up and the waiters were more interested in cleaning empty tables. No one asked if the food was ok and then when the bill came there was a 10% service charge! What service?! I would not recommend or ever return
1
$70 for a Pho Bo and a second dish is not cheap. The food was not freshly cooked.Service is good, and the locational on the river bank is interesting.A bit disappointing
3
Opted for this nice little restaurant with many recommendation at Clarke Quay. Nice located by the river. I know its a tourist area, yet Singapore can have its true sensations just at the heart of it! This was just a food experience at average level. Nothing to be super excited about, nice presentation of the food, buy I make better fresh spring rolls myself. Went for a been salad with star fruit, nice presentation and good taste. Wanted that extra little Saigon experience, but not from the dishes we chose. Drinks OK, but mostly sweet options among the specialities
1
Went for dinner today with friends who were visiting from out of town. Totally 8 people. Ordered drinks (for 6) and starters. Good setting and great location. Then asked for a glass of tap water and the evening went downhill quickly from there. Hostile looks. Caustic comments "we are here to do business and not serve free water". This after we had ordered food and drinks for over $180. Wonder where the renowned Singaporean, Vietnamese and Asian hospitality had disappeared. When asked to speak to the Manager, we were coldly told that they could not serve tap water. Totally unexpected and unacceptable in a country where the tap water is perfectly safe. It was a matter of principle for our friend who does not drink bottled water given the huge waste with plastic/glass bottles/transportation, etc. We were rushed through our dinner and the staff were glad to see us leave. Never going back there.
4
We had dinner here and, despite how busy everywhere was, we got lucky with a table by the river. Really quite romantic and fun watching the bumboats coming and going. Our meal was delicious - lovely fresh spring rolls followed by great noodles.
4
Nice spot with both terrasse in front of the river and room with a live band starting around 10PM.
Good food, with classic asian stuffs.

Little Saigon Restaurant & Bar provides a pleasant and laid-back dining experience amidst the hustle and bustle of Clarke Quay, offering an extensive selection of modern interpretations of Vietnamese bites, exotic cocktails and live music from resident band Acoustic Bounce, Which is a pleasant change to usual restaurant cuisines that we usually go to. Highlights of our meal was Saigon Party Platter which contained, Fried spring rolls, sugarcane prawns, and pork meatballs, fried seasoned calamari and prawn crackers. I especially like the pork meatballs which were coated in sesame and deep fried. The sugar cane prawns were also unique and nice. Fresh Spring Rolls Vietnamese rice roll with shredded chicken, prawns, herbs and vermicelli were also delicious. Frog Legs, The frog legs were deep fried, then sautÃ©ed with onions and butter sauce. Loved this. It came with a slice of lime and flavored salt on the side. Absolute Must-try! Shaking Tenderloin Steak with Fries Stir-fried beef slices with bell peppers, tomatoes and onions, Good to share among a group. Pho BO a traditional beef noodle soup, with rice noodles, beef slices, beef brisket in broth, The broth is unlike the light broth you find elsewhere and itâ€™s darker and flavorful. For Dessert Caphe CrÃ¨me BrÃ»lÃ©e the CrÃ¨me Brule has a unique flavour, as it has been infused with Vietnamese coffee. The coffee hint is mild Coconut Surprise Served in a fresh whole coconut, with lemongrass jelly and diced fresh mango. The restaurant has an extensive drink list and variety of cocktails, including traditional, champagne-based, Asian cocktails and Martinis. We managed to try several and the interesting ones were, Coffee Martini I loved this, It looks like black coffee, but it has a dash of Kahlua in it. Lemon Basil Martini This was refreshing, Ingredients were Gin, basil leaf, Sweet and Sour & simple syrup. And finally Exotic Star Made with Vodka, pineapple juice, mint leaf, sugar & bitters. It had a slice of star fruit on the glass, which gave the cocktail its name. Itâ€™s nice and easy to drink. I recommend the alfresco area, and if possible, next to the railings, where you can enjoy the view of Singapore River and the boats cruising along, while you enjoy your meal here. Lovely food, atmosphere and service. Highly recommend it

This is in a busy clubby nightspot. The focus is on party time, so don't expect a restaurant experience.So having got that out of the way.The food was not bad at all and the portions were large. We sat overlooking the quay. Price was very reasonable - for the location.Service was friendly but inefficient.So if you want a reasonable meal at a reasonable price in a bouncy nightspot it's fine.Don't go expect a Vietnamese culinary experience
4
overloaded with Thai, Singaporean and Chinese food decided to take a crack at this place serving cuisine from Vietnam.Had the chilli crab and a beef and lemon dish and really enjoyed it. Service was a bit erratic as they forgot about our drinks but other than that it was a good first experience
3
We ordered drinks, spring rolls and the beef noodle. They forgot about the spring rolls, and when we asked for them they arrived after the main. They were very oily and not very nice.We arrived in Singapore from Vietnam, where we'd loved Beef Noodle. This dish was not great quality either.Very expensive for what we got - back it was a lovely spot to sit and watch the world go by.
3
Our first meal in Singapore was in this place. We simply wanted to try something new and unique. For us, this was not a really good choice and this could also be because of our food palette. Food ordered is as follows Grilled duck breast : The portion was fine but the dish was too dry for us. We could barely manage to finish this. Also this is served with sticky rice. Till the time you do not add a lot of sauce to this, it became difficult for us to have Lemon grass beef tenderloin : This was a nice dish. But I would have liked the beef to have some more juice in it. The location of this place is nice and if you can handle traditional vietnamese food, this could be your choice
2
Singapore these days is not cheap and Clarke Key reflects this, but then you should expect quality. Hoped for a romantic evening before our sail out of Singapore. The setting on the river is fine, and romantic, so all looked good. My 'prawn' starter was 'minced' prawn; a gloopy, soggy mess with no taste whatsoever !!. I should have known, but went on the have fish which was just Ok. My wifes chicken dish was undercooked, and the rice cold. We complained, but after paying a fortune for two beers left deeply disappointed. We got refunded for one course, but this place is busy, so perhaps they are taking their eye off the quality. A romantic evening ruined, unfortunately our worse meal while in Singapor
4
Located right at CQ, overlooking the river and an outdoor seating, this is one of the many restaurants which is good for a typical CQ dinner experience. Though I was alone, I had the opportunity to find out that Little Saigon was the only restaurant in CQ which serves frog legs (i guess) Good and quick service by the restaurant guys and a mid-range pricing menu with good quality food has earned brownie points. You may try the fried spring roll too (for vegetarians) 17% tax on total billing !!

My colleagues and I were at Clarke Quay looking for a place to dine and chill, and we spotted this restaurant. We decided to give it a try, as it offered Vietnamese food, which is a pleasant change to usual restaurant cuisines that we usually go to. We came by around 6.30pm, just as the sun was setting and the night lights were coming alive. We were given a choice of indoor or alfresco seating, and I promptly chose the seat along the riverâ€™s edge, which afforded nice views of the river while we dined.We perused the menu and ordered. Here are the highlights of my meal:Appetisers:- Saigon Party Platter: $45. Fried spring rolls, sugarcane prawns, pork meatballs, fried seasoned calamari and prawn crackers. This could feed 5 people, if you are ordering other food items. I especially like the pork meatballs which were coated in sesame and deep fried. The sugar cane prawns were also unique and nice. - Prawns & Pineapple Rolls: $12. This was a fried roll with a creamy prawns and pineapple filling. The cream was a surprise, as Asian cooking doesnâ€™t have cream in them. - Fresh Spring Rolls: $12. Vietnamese rice roll with shredded chicken, prawns, herbs and vermicelli. Easy appetiser and I like the chilli dip that goes with it.- SautÃ©ed Morning Glory with Garlic: $8.50. Stir-fried kang kong vegetables with sliced garlic. Taste alright. - Frog Legs: $14. The frog legs were deep fried, then sautÃ©ed with onions and butter sauce. Loved this. It came with a slice of lime and flavoured salt on the side. Absolute Must-try!Mains:- "Shaking" Tenderloin Steak with Fries: $24. Stir-fried beef slices with bell peppers, tomatoes and onions. It came with French fries. Good to share amongst a group. - Pho Bo: $20. A traditional beef noodle soup, with rice noodles, beef slices, beef brisket in broth. The broth is unlike the light broth you find elsewhere and its darker and flavourful. I would prefer the beef to be thinner and poached slightly. It comes with the herbs and chilli on the side for individual garbishing.Dessert- Caphe Creme BrÃ»lÃ©e: $10. The Creme brÃ»lÃ©e has a unique flavor, as it has been infused with Vietnamese coffee. The coffee hint is mild, - Coconut Surprise: $12. Served in a fresh whole coconut, with lemongrass jelly and diced fresh mango.DrinksThe restaurant has an extensive drink list and what caught my eye were their variety of cocktails, including traditional, champagne-based, Asian cocktails and Martinis. I managed to try several and the interesting ones were:- Coffee Martini: $16.50 I loved this! It looks like black coffee in a a martini glass. But it has a dash of Kahlua in it, making me wonder where did the cream went. Main ingredient is Vietnamese coffee, along with vodka & simple syrup. Good!- Lemon Basil Martini: $16.50. This was refreshing. Ingredients were Gin, basil leaf, Sweet and Sour & simple syrup. Its nice!- Exotic Star: $15.50. Made with Vodka, pineapple juice, mint leaf, sugar & bitters. It had a slice of star fruit on the glass, which gave the cocktail its name. Its nice and easy to drink.- Viet's Mystery: $15.50. Vodka, creme de casis, Sweet and Sour & ginger ale. A fizzy cocktail, which I drank quite fast, as it was easy to drink . Not bad.I recommend the alfresco area, and if possible, next to the railings, where you can enjoy the view of Singapore River and the boats cruising along, while you enjoy your meal here. The restaurant also has a live band that plays from 9.30pm. A nice place to chill. Recommended

We ate the spring rolls, fried noodles with veg and a delicious morning glory with ginger. Freshly cooked and delicious flavours. Great spot on the river with live music.
5
There is a lot of live music in Clarke but the band here take a lot of requests and all round are awesome. For 2 single guys this bar was very friendly and were always able to meet people.
5
Me and my friend have enjoyed ourself in Singapore for a few days and, had a perfect 'small bar experience' at Little Saigon. Great live band and a good mix of young and old singles and pars make it an enjoyable night!
4
We ordered spring rolls, calamari, pinapple and shrimp rolls and stir fried beef nodles. Everything to be served at the same time. If you enjoy pinapple in food I really reccomend the pinapple and shrimp rolls. Yummy.The calamari were also tasty and crispy. A little under seasoned thoug but by asking for soya on the side they turned out great! The only thing that we didn't enjoy were thR noodels a little too soggy and lacking taste for us.My favourite was the dessert though. The mud pie. That according to myself had nothing to do with mud pie but was absolutely delicious. It had a thin chokolate cake bottom (the mud cake?) then a thick layer of vanilla ice cream and on top a layer of bayleys ice cream. Sooo good
2
Great location, yes. No argument. Service, okay-good. No argument. Prices. Expensive for the quality!!! And this includes the beers which are 2x the price of anywhere else in Singapore. But I guess, that's what it's like if you want to dine at Clarke Quay ..... And I live here so plenty of options but for guests, we compromise. And I suppose expecting good Vietnamese cuisine in this area was a little too optimistic. Nowhere close. Fried Vietnamese spring rolls in rancid oil. Poor quality (fatty) meat in the meatballs. More batter on the calamari than the calamari itself. A sweet chilli crab dip that came with nothing to dip with - extra for the very ordinary and insufficient 4 small dipping bread buns! A very poor example of some of the fine cuisine we have to offer in Singapore and, what's even more scary is that for those on weekend stopovers, this may be the first or only area they frequent ie Clarke Quay. Not sure that this (or some of the other restaurants on this strip) is showcasing our true colors....Never again. A walk or expensive drink, yes. But dining, never again.
5
We went to Little Siagon for dinner because if the great reviews on TripAdvisor and weren't disappointed. The service was excellent and food and drinks were just as good. We had a seat right on the river's edge and were close to the colourful and vibrant action of Clarke Quay through out evening. We would definitely return on our next visit to Singapor
3
I use to live in Vietnam and when I seen this place I just had to try. It's right on the river and I was seated in the best spot. Service was really friendly and very attentive, but I have to be honest and say the food was average and tasted nothing like Vietnamese food. I had the pork spring rolls fried as I couldn't have them in the fresh kind, and it was just like eating oil, very greasy, I also ordered the po beef noodle soup and again tasteless and they gave me sauces they came from a bottle and were sweet, this is not the Vietnamese food I know. The beef was one big chunk of steak just thrown in, not sliced, and the broth was just like hot water no flavour. Menu also no variety, it's a pity cause the service was really good.
4
Had dinner with my family here last night, started with the Fresh Spring Rolls and Dumplings with Chilli Crab Dipping Sauce then followed up with mains of Lemongrass Beef and Grilled Duck Breast, all of the food was very good but the Beef Tenderloin was cooked to perfection.Best of all was the great pricing of our drinks during happy hour
5
Spending 2 days in Singapore on a stop over we visited twice! Staff were really friendly and welcoming, all reasonably priced. Nice atmosphere and a great little spot to have a few drinks and watch Singapore go by... If you have a free hour I would highly recommend going for a drink - the cocktail menu was lovely!
4
A bit pricey by Singapore standards, but awesome views as it is by the riverside at Clark Quey. The service is slightly on the slower side and the staff might come across as a little too straight - but they do make an awesome Vietnamese coffee (both hot and cold
5
This bar is loads of fun to visit. The band is unreal, and the cocktails ate unreal too. Definately worth the visit
3
Walked all over Clarke Quay before stopping here for dinner. After 4 trips to Vietnam I guess we were curious to see what Singapore style Vietnamese food was like. Given the touristy location we were not surprised that the food was pricey but disappointed that it lacked flavor.Small plate of duck $22 , pub-style calamari $16 , sparkling water $10. Beer and wine priced about the same as the other venues.While we were in Singapore, we experienced a full range of culinary adventures, from a big night out with friends at KuDeTa to street food down a lane in Little India . Both of these we loved for different reasons but unfortunately our visit to Little Saigon left us feeling unimpressed.On the plus side though, the location is vibrant and colourful and worth a look at
5
Came here last weekend with my relatives for a few drinks. The bar is not that big but it is packed of peoples and I would say it is one of the happening bar in Clarke Quay. The live band was good and played a very good music. Most of the peoples are happy and dancing whole night. Fast service. Will come back if I have a Singapore in the future
1
After taking the cruise around the river suggested by the Hop on, Hop off bus we walked along the quay and chose this Restaurant. Service was terrible but food seemed OK, to start with. Had a good view sitting along the river, and the food arrived quickly.Unfortunately 2 of the dinners we were with ended up with food poisoning and we're up all night. The worst part was they were still sick for our flight home and ended up in Quarantine at the airport and unable to fly home for 3 days!
4
There are many restaurants along this strip... we were pleased with our choice to dine here. The food was flavorful and served hot! We had the chili crab dip, prawn/pineapple rolls, and tradition beef and noodles. The service was average- nothing special but nothing bad either. The prices are comparable to other restaurants in the area. Try it
2
It was really poor value for money. The portions were starter size at $12 ea. If you are looking for a drink and something to nibble and you have to have vietnamese in Clarke Quay, then you may as well go here. I had the chilli crab and the crab was an unrecognizable shredded soup that tasted more like sweet chilli sauce than anything crab related. There is a lovely view of the river (which you can get anywhere else in Clarke Quay). I advised anyone I saw looking at the menu to avoid eating there. There is so much variety at Clarke Quay and no reason to waste your money at Little Saigon
4
The restaurants along the Singapore River, at Clarke Quay, make up the more raucous part of Singapore - everything is relative. Little Saigon is one in that string, with a nice waterside terrace close enough to the pier where the tourist boats leave to enjoy the on-going hustle and bustle. The menus is not big, but all items look promising - focus is on meats (chicken, porc, beef), vegetarians have a bit of a challenge. Based on two experiences, food quality is consistent. The Pho Bo is well presented and tasty. So are fried noodles with seafood, and the porkribs. The starter of mixed snacks was a bit to greasy to our taste. As crowds build up along the quay, service becomes slightly erratic, and the live music coming from the establishment can be a bit of a conversation killer. But the overall experience is good, good food in a festive environment
2
The rice paper rolls were very nice, though expensive at SGD$14.00 a serve, and only 3 rice paper rolls cut into thirds were provided. Any changes to the menu like adding chicken to mixed vegetables was certainly not accepted. The vegetables I ordered tasted as if they had been steamed and then stir field in butter or oil with black pepper; they had no flavour. The food experience at Little Saigon certainly tainted my idea of Asian restaurants in an Asian country as a must visit - until of course, I ate at more authentic hawker cooking kitchens.Ambience though was wonderful on Clarke Quay but you would do better from a food perspective at hawker cooking kitchens, albeit the ambience
4
We had a fabulous time at Little Saigon and thoroughly enjoyed our meal, drinks and the atmosphere. The food was well cooked and relatively inexpensive compared to other places we ate whist in Singapore.Come here for the lively atmosphere and the great food; you won't regret it
4
The friendly staff and attractive asian menu hooked us off the riverside walk and we weren't disappointed , the staff were attentive and helpful, the food very appetizing and well presented, the prawns with kiwi dip were delicious as was the Vietnamese fried rice. Overlooking the Singapore river and near to the river cruise terminal
4
the best part of this place is the great live band which turns out amazing numbers the ambiance while sitting also the riverside having a drink and yes the food is also quite good making it a great place to enjoy an evening out
4
Great location right next to the river and middle of busy nightlife. Friendly service and large enough menu to choose from and food was tasty. Popular Place, so hard to get table sometimes
5
Great bands great music. One of my favorites. the best to sit down drink and listen to their live band n service is good too. Must visit
3
We really enjoyed the food and the atmosphere. The view on the river is why 1l bottle of water costs 10S$ (!!!). The prices are similar to other restaurants nearby.
5
On a Saturday evening, April this year, my friend and I (we both are not Singaporeans) luckily got the table by the riverbank where we spent great time chit-chatting accompanied with flows of wine while enjoying the traffic of tourist boats navigating the famous Singapore River and the colourful lights of the malls across the river. Minutes by minutes, the restaurant got fuller and fuller so that any of its crew had to work swiftly (without being less attentiveness or it should have hired more crew to anticipate weekend). Our orders were finally served Ã¢â‚¬Â¦.. each was in big portion! Hardly could I finish my beef pho. No space left for desert. The fried spring rolls, beef salad with sliced starfruit (belimbing), and beef pho were marvelous. The salad is my fave. However, its beef wrapped in leaf + steamed rice (sorry, I forgot the name) was not delectable. Above all, we did enjoy our weekend dinner there
3
Just yesterday i spent my christmas eve in little saigon, drink 2 glasess of Heineken, the price is $36. Too expensive but you never want to spend your christmas sitting on river side only. You can enjoy the night without buying some food, just a beer and you can enjoy clark quay better
5
The location is grat, near the river. Service was good, the food was very nice. I liked the atmosphere, feels more like a place to go drinking and chilling then eating. The food was very reasonably priced, the drinks are indeed a bit expensive, but that's the same situation in all the restaurants and bars around Clark Quay
3
We arrived a bit later in the evening, with no reservation. And were given immediately a table by the river, which was a nice thing and perhaps a bit lucky, considering the place was almost full.Service was OK. The waitress didn't write our order and nothing was forgotten. That's something that always impresses me, when a waiter can memorize and remember everything in an order.We ordered a bottle of wine and, except for the first glass, we had to top up our glasses by ourselves. Not so good!Other than that, it was OK. Average food quality and honest prices. Nothing to complain about. But, also nothing to write home about
5
We discovered Little Saigon in Clarke Quay while exploring Singapore on foot. Those who have done this will know how hot and humid Singapore gets, especially while walking. Therefore we were so grateful to find Little Saigon right next to the Singapore River. After taking our seat at a table overlooking the river we realised they have a "Happy Hour" until 8pm every day, where you get 50% discount on beer, wine and house spirits. A draught of Tiger beer was $8 and a cocktail was $7.50. Needless to say we visited them more than once
4
Stayed at SG for four days. and ofcourse as they say, you need to experience the best party zone which is Clark Quay. I went to this bar called Little Saigon, For me it is a best chilling spot where you can enjoy a glass of beer with a live acoustic band in the background. A lot of tourist are going here that's why no wonder costs of service is kinda expensive. I ordered 2 glasses of beer which cost me a total of S$36. That's equivalent to P1124.00! Whoah..! very expensive..! But its ok, its really worth it because of the experience as well as the great view of the river while enjoying your drinks..
