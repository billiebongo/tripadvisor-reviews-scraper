Did a consultation at renhai downstairs and had lunch here. The place is so nice to have a very hearty lunch, the music is just so calming. Food are excellent, pure taste of good ingredients without any strong flavour such as msg. Very recommended

Visited Herbal Oasis with my wife for a weekday lunch, and found this to be a pleasantly surprising quiet sanctuary. Simple menu comprising traditional chinese herbal soups, and rice mixes (such as pumpkin rice, sweet potato brown rice). They also have a decent chinese tea selection. A set that includes a soup, rice and tea goes for $16- a decent price considering it is located in the heart of the CBD. Soups and rice were both tasty. Would also be an excellent location for a quiet business meeting, or just a simple meal to have on your own. Take note that they only have a daily limited menu, eg only 4 soups and 2 rice types were available when I visited. The full menu is more than double the actual selection available. Will definitely come back again. Opening hours are currently 11am-3pm.

I come here frequently for lunch, and its truly a respite away from all the hustle and bustle of the CBD. The ambience is relaxing and peaceful, and the service is prompt and homely. The food on their menu changes daily, but is consistently good - particularly their soups. An express meal consisting of rice (different types daily too!) and a soup costs only SGD$9.90. Truly value for money and good for you

The restaurant/cafe serves food cooked in Chinese herbs, with an emphasis on herbal broths. They also have a few a la carte dishes apart from the broths as well as some light desserts. And surprisingly, for a Chinese restaurant, they also have muffins! I had the bitter gourd soup, which was excellent! Bitter gourds came stuffed with minced pork, carrots, vermicelli and other ingredients. My soup was accompanied by walnut and brown rice, which was also very good! I was surprised to find the rice lightly salted, which balanced raisins in the rice, topped off by crunchy walnuts. We also ordered fish cooked in Chinese herbs, it was excellent! Fresh fish in shallow herbal broth. For dessert, we had flavored jellos which were not too sweet. We also tried the black sesame and lemon muffin which sounds strange but actually tasted good. Unfortunately, the muffin was small. Prices here are reasonable, would definitely consider coming back
