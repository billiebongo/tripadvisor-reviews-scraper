I went to the one in Parkway Parade. My favorites are jongkong (which isn't always available), getuk-getuk, pulut panggang and the pandan chiffon cake. The kuih is expensive, most probably due to the rental. Noticed that the stall in Takashimaya has moved out.

I am totally addicted to this place....it is the first place I go to when I arrive.
It has such yummy treats.
Though the negative is the treats don't arrive until 11-12noon each day! lol

This is a chain that sells Peranakan kueh kueh and cakes.We like the kueh kosui, as well as kaya, which is good for breakfast. They also sell breads, as well as cookies such as pineapple tarts. They have several options for cakes, including the kueh lapis (striped spiced Indonesian cake), as well as walnut cake, which is delicious with its walnut bits. Prices start from around $1 upwards
