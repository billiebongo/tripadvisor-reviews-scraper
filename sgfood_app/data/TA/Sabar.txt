I personally have a weakness for mackerel done Japanese-style, and Sabar at Wisma Atria's 5/F Japan Food Town did not disappoint. First, we had the saba sashimi presented in 5 styles: soyu-marinated, tataki (seared), vinegar-marinated, fresh as-is, and smoked - at 2-pieces each style, a little pricey at $28, but quality & freshness were there - very good! Next came the complimentary saba sushi (flash their barcode & post) - it was so typically Kansai-style sushi which I thoroughly enjoyed. Finally, their teishoku (set) grilled toro-saba - lightly crispy on the skin, oily and moist flesh beneath - well-complimented with either of a lime or slice of lemon - it was easily one of the best grilled saba I've had - a substantial meal in itself at $25. Kudos to owner, Okada-san from Osaka, for bringing Sabar to Singapore - will be my go-to place for all things mackerel :-) BTW, service was fast, informative and most welcoming
