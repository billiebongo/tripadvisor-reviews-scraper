Taste is good, value for money. Go with friends, but not with family because of the location and ambience. Service is worse.
5
Fresh, Value for money and authentic tandoori, naan and butter chicken curry, the lamb curry was also perfectly balanced.

I'm a lone white female and risked standing out like a sore thumb at this place, but it was a great experience and really interesting! Sit down, get handed your banana leaf with potato curry, cabbage, poppadom and pickle, and just wait for a myriad of other servers to bring you the rice, the dahl, or other topping of your choice. Really refreshing to have such a high vegetable content after a lot of other Asian cuisine based just on meats, soy sauces and rice. It felt healthy and refreshing. I stuck with vegetarian options and a hot chai, with the meal coming to an incredible $5.70 only - amazing given that I was served and checked on by around 6 different servers. I was even joined by a local at my table (the place started to get busier after 3pm before the 4pm closing) and we chatted and shared a curry, which was so nice. Would definitely recommend, and Little India is nice for exploring - the mosques, art wall, colourful painted buildings and Tekka centre for shopping are well worth a visit fuelled by Gandhi's cuisine. I'll be back

What a great experience. First you wash your hands (most of the patrons eat with their hands, but they do have silverware if you want it). You look at the menu on the wall and then when the waiter comes tell him or her what you want. The food comes served on a banana leaf.The chai is sweet and excellent. The vegetable sides were very good, and the cheese prata to scoop up the yogurt sauce was our favorite. The chicken masala was just ok but every thing else we really liked. We had a lot of food-4 orders of prata, 3 chais, 2 chicken dishes, biryani rice, yogurt, dahl and it was still less than 30 dollars. Would definitely return

If you are not fussy about the almost spartan setting, Ghandi is a worthwhile restaurant to bring friends for a taste of authentic South Indian food. You can tell from the constant queues forming at the takeaway counter that Gandhi has an impressive following. I'd recommend the mutton, fried fish, fish cutlets as my favourites. And don't forget to order a glass of Moor, a diluted version of Yoghurt served with green onion and mild spices!A word of advice: Avoid going on Sundays from 12 to 2pm. It's always super crowded!!

I visited this restaurant on my own whilst visiting Singapore, because I was recommended it. It opens at 6pm in the evening and becomes very busy. I felt a little out of place, as the only European, but a local man adopted me and it was a fun, cheap and authentic banana leaf meal
4
Great food at reasonable prices. But the secret is out so you will have to deal with the queues. The staff are polite. This restaurant gives you the impression that it is a family run business. The chicken fried with opinions and curry leaf is to die for. Go early, it's sold out fast. After 5.30, Varde will be freshly made.
5
The taste is equivalent to home cooked south Indian food. Usually crowded after 12:30 pm. Serve lunch till 4pm. Pricing is very economical, as I wonder how they can afford with free flow of rice, vegetables and pickles. Hope they expand their business to other parts of Singapore.

Gandhi Restaurant, from the exterior may look old and run down but do not be deceived. Their food is authentic Southern Indian banana leaf food, tasty, and value for money. The other banana leaf restaurants in the vicinity are pale in comparison with Gandhi's.If you are going there for lunch, you will be greeted by a long queue. These are people who are ordering their packed lunches. Go straight into their dining area and find a seat if you can. It is normally crowded between 12.30pm and 1:30pm.Once you have found a seat, someone will drop a banana leaf on your table with rice and vegetables. Another person will bring a tray of fish and meat to choose from. When you are almost done, yet another person will bring you the bill. They a system that seems to work! Pay at the counter as you leave.Some of the dishes this restaurant offers that others do not are boiled egg curry, boiled quail's egg curry, and dry shark stir fry. Also worth trying are their fish cutlets but they are only available after 1:30pm.Worth the vist, value for me, good experience
5
The food eaten here feels like homecooked food. Everything is so tasty. I would recommend coming here early if you are planning to have lunch as it tends to get crowded during lunch hour.I would have lunch here more often if it wasnt so crowded all the time.Must try the food here if you are in the area!
5
a must try in little india. Spices are sensational. prices are very friendly. might be chaotic during lunch and dinner.
4
Enjoyed the delicious Indian food served in banana leaf. The place is often crowded during lunch and dinner time.
And love the chicken masala and the fish balls.
4
I like the south Indian meals here which will be served on banana leaf. Also like pepper chicken and chilly chicken.
4
Its great quality for the money. Staff was great and spoke enough english. You can take out or dine in.

Jostle with the crowd for the real banana leaf experience. From locals to foreigners, from budget diners to tourists. In the beginning (years ago), there were mostly Indians. Blue-collar Indians and adventurous Singaporeans in need of authenticity. Then, the tourists arrive. Nowadays, you can see a mish mash of locals, tourists and Indians all dining happily, elbow-to-elbow, banana-leaf-to-banana-leaf. Basic meal consists of a humongous dollop of rice (prepare to stop the waiter if you don't want to overdose on carbohydrates), 1 piece of papadum and 2 servings of vegetables served on a fresh piece of banana leaf. On top of that, the waiters will bring dishes of various meat and accompaniment -- chicken, mutton, fish, etc. Order what you want. The final bill won't make you faint. Surprisingly, it is faster to dine in than to order out because the queue for ordering is long and the speed with which they pack is rather slow

Ghandi is an institution. Traditional banana leave rice complete with all the fixings. The waiters come around with containers bearing rice, vegetables, pickles, papadum and curries of your choice. All of these are free flow and can be refilled at any time. Delicious. Now come the adds; mutton, mutton ribs, mutton tripe, fried fish, chicken, quails' eggs, all heavenly prepared. Choose what you will, just be aware that there will be far more food than you can possibly eat - the servings appear small, but coupled with the rice and condiments, they're real gut busters. I would especially recommend the mutton curry and the turmeric fried fish. Really good value for money for this quality. Try eating using your hand for an experience. Be aware that the place does get very crowded and there is no such thing as a reservation. It's first come, first served.

A banana leaf meal is a must when visiting Gandhi. Amazingly tasty curries. They have a set selection of vegies that they provide free with the banana leaf meal. It is air conditioned so very comfortable. Always packed so you might have to share a table with others, but worth it

We arrived for lunch and found a long queue of customers at the takeaway counter. We were presented with banana leaves upon sitting at the table with two serves of vegetables and rice. We were offered a choice of vegetable lentil curry or a fish or meat curry. We also ordered chicken, mutton, crab and egg curry. The mutton was slightly tough and the other curries were just average in taste. None of the curries packed a punch in terms of spiciness which I would expect in a South Indian restaurant. The service was practically non existent. We found it almost impossible to get an extra serve of vegetables and/or pappadum. When we finally got the attention of the staff we were told they were not taking orders for hot drinks because they didn't have sufficient staff. The bill was reasonable at $35 for four adults but overall the food was pretty average and the service was bad so I don't think we will be back anytime soon
5
Wow. Wow and wow.Simply loved it. The food was amazing. I was taken their by a local I met in couch surfing and he was not wrong by saying this was the best Indian in town. Highly, highly recommend this. If I'm ever break in Singapore, that's where I'll be going religiously. I can't remember what I ordered but the menu is limited. This isn't fancy cooking, it's straightforward, in your face, pure delish. If you like eating with your hands, come here to never forget
4
The restauran is located a stone throw from in the heart of Little India. The restaurant serves veg and non veg food and very good Bru Coffee. The service is good for a restaurant like this as it sees a large turn around of customers.I will recommend all the dishes that you can stomach. I love them all as i had fish cutlet, fish puttu, fried fish, mutton, veg rice and coffee. Simply Awesome
3
Overall just Average South Indian food. The menu is quite common and you can find many of these in the Little India area.
5
Very genuine Indian restaurant. Nice south Indian cuisine.
Good and fast service.
Not a luxury restaurant, very basic.
5
South Indians this place is a must visit in Singapore.
Great food and the cost will be the least you ever paid for!
Both vegetarian and non-veg is great!
The sweets are also fantastic.!
4
The curry gravy with rice is delightful. I simply love the fish cutlets. A simple meal and so satifying.
5
Wonderful food. Staff serves the food fast despite the crowd. They have a huge clarity of food to choose from. Will definitely come again.
5
Enjoyed the food here, loved the mutton and fried onion chicken, air-conditioned but crowded during lunch time the take-away queue is long too much easier to get a seat though, would come back, really affordable no fills kind of place.
5
very very good for people who can really eat their hearts out and to tell you the pricing is a bit more but still okay to all.
5
Best Indian food in town. Affordable and delicious.A bit crowded during lunch hour and have to share table with other.Food was amazingly delicious.Variety of dishes are available.My favorite is chicken Marsala and Dhal curry complement with Lassam drink :)
4
This South Indian restaurant serving cheap meals to blue and white collars alike take the pride of place with me. It's curry is delightful and the chicken and mutton servings are just wonderful comparing to other Indian eateries serving lunch and dinner . It's crowded must of the time and the service is still pleasing. You will definitely appreciate the food and come back for more

Definitely recommended visit for banana leaf meal.Nestled just behind Serangoon Road (Little India), the restaurant offers a real experience of Indian banana leaf meal in Singapore.Staff - friendly and prompt.Ambiance - good, air conditioned area offered.Food - top class banana leaf meal, curries and condiments are out of this World.Price - very good value.Dr.Ruben KumarMalaysi

We had been recommended this restaurant by a local in Singaporean.Traditional and authentic . We had to wait for around 20 minutes to get a table. The meal was superb, served on a banana leaf with wonderful chutneys and a spicey lamb curry.
4
the food was so tasty and authentic, very popular among the local Indians. when you sit down they bring out a plate covered in a leaf with sauces and a papadum and then scoop some rice on to your plate. you choose what meat you want and they bring it out to you (you can ask for no spice). they them have different types of sauces to put on the rice. the best part is that you eat with your hands!! only thing i can fault is that they could be a bit friendlier with their service however it is not stopping me from taking my sister there tomorrow so she can try it out. would definitely recommend
5
Great local place. Crowded at Lunch where you could sit next to the locals. The set meal of several condiments and curries and rice is only SG$4. a bargain. YOu can add meat, such as chicken marsala or chicken 65. Our entire meal including lime juices was $15. A steal. Loved the fact that the meal was served on a banana leaves. the service is not fancy and decently attentive. for a foreigner this place was a gem. If you expect expert service you will be dissappointe

This restaurant is my husband's favorite place for Indian meal. I used to doubt why he likes this place so much, until I was brought to this place to dine in with him. Without nice renovation, this place although old, is a nice and down to earth place for enjoying an authentic Indian cuisine.The place is always crowded, packed with not only Indians but also many people of other races. The staffs were always busy, but their service are very fast and good. They tried to answer to your request as soon as possible when you approached them. Specially mentioned one lady(suppose is the lady boss) who is helping in the dining area, she is courteous and helpful. My husband always bought the food home for me, but the feeling is so much different from dining in the restaurant, where you get hot and fragrance rice, especially the biryani rice with those delicious side dishes. Is best that you complete your meal with a glass of Lassi. Price of the food is reasonable, with the free flow of rice, side dishes and crackers you get, and most importantly, the taste of their food is great!Overall, my few trips to this restaurant were great. If you ask me about Indian food, this restaurant will be my first choice
4
Although the restaurant is small and quaint it was packed to the brim of people! It's the kind of place you sit where there is a seat, which might mean on a table with 10 random people. The food was great, for the price you pay you get well fed. The service was prompt and friendly. Don't be disheartened by curry dished from a bucket, it is amazing!

There is a lot of focus on the service in the reviews. For me, I went not reading any previous reviews, but knowing that I shouldn’t expect a lot from the place. It just had that look and feel of a family-run hole-in-the-wall that focuses on cheap good food, but lacks professional customer service. With that mind, I wasn’t really disappointed in the service quality. Don’t get me wrong, it wasn’t good. The menu is small and tapped to a pillar. No one came to our table when we sat down. We tried waving a few people down, but they just told us to wait. Eventually someone did come and we ordered. The guy didn’t speak great English and so it was difficult to make a decision. The guy seemed like a good person and wanted to be helpful. He just didn’t really know how to help properly. After we ordered, the food came quickly. We ordered the set menu with Chicken Masala. Everything was good, but wasn’t good enough for us to go out of our way to go back. I suggest if you’re in Little India that you stop by first to have a look and make a decision yourself
4
Whilst I say downmarket, the place appears reasonably clean and organised, and the vegetarian food is good. The meat alternatives take a little more effort, as the meat to bone ratio is a little lower than at the more westernised restaurants. Service is a bit hit and miss, but you get there eventually.Definitely worth a try for that more "authentic" Indian eating experience. No need for the dinner jacket here.DO try the lhassi, this was one of the best I have had outside of India

I ate at Gandhi's - South Indian non veg food. Despite at the other reviews - the locals are lined up to eat at this restaurant, that i why I went. Forget about Race Course Road - this is the business, delicious. The staff were practical, friendly and fast. They offer you rice (plain or biriyani), a gravy of your choice (the fish gravy was divine) and curries- I had masala chicken, chappati. I comes on the banana leaf with vegetables and a divine homemade pickle. I also had a fish and the mutton masala on later visits, simply divine. On visits I enjoyed kesari and Mysore Pak - which was simply melt in the mouth heavenly. The masala tea was the best I had on my latest trip to Singapore, with that subtle, sweet chai masala scent and taste. In short - please go to the place - the locals do. I paid $10.20 SGD for an absolute stuffing of excellent food, and I won't be going back to race course road for a long time

On 6 August 2014 at about 1700hrs, I patronised Gandhi Restaurant situated at 31, Chander Road, Singapore 219538 together with my wife. At that time the restaurant was empty and I was the second person in the queue. After serving the customer infront of me it was my turn for my order to be taken. The waiter chose to ignore me and proceeded to serve another customer who had just walked into the restaurant. The customer did not queue, it is obvious that the customer is of the same country man of the waiter or could even be his friend as they were both comfortable conversing with each other. The waiter chose to ignore me and proceeded to take orders from the customer who had cut queue. When I questioned the waiter about his behaviour, he claimed that he did not see me which is a blatant lie and was very rude with his words. He was very daring to challenge me with his rude and provacative words and gangsterly body language by telling me "what I want now and what can I do".  His behaviour is very appalling and unacceptable. I reported the matter to the cashier (a lady) and it seems that the matter will be swept under the carpet. Hence, I am writing to you believing that the management of Gandhi Restaurant can be made known that their staff needs to be trained in customer service and not to only serve customers of their own flock.  I have patronized Gandhi Restaurant for the past 16 years and this is the first time such an incident had happened to me. The reason I amwriting to highlight this incident is because Gandhi Restaurant is situated within the tourist belt in Little india and with many tourist patronizing little India this sort of behaviour will tarnish the image of Little India and Singapore

This no-frills place is really packed during meal times. My Taxi driver told me about it and he was spot on.You dine from banana leaves and the service is prompt and efficient. The curries are superb but the setting is basic and reminded me of previous meals i had years ago in Malayasia. I enjoyed the food very much and it is very cheap given the quality and taste of the food. if you want to try eating with your hands, enjoy your curry and can balance very good value with a basic clean setting you will leave the place feeling satisfied

One of the Restaurants which I visit frequently in Singapore. The waiters are kind and serve patiently. Food is very cheap and tasty also food worth more than paying.
1
I was surprised to read the reviews that said that this was a place where the locals go. It isn't. It really serves the foreign workers primarily. You will see that as soon as you walk in. The food is served in a very unappetising manner. The hygiene standard is rather low. All you have to do is to check out the washroom at the back to see what I mean. Non-existent customer service as well. So, yes - go to it if you want to experience an adventure. But you can get similiar food in more hygenic setting where there is more customer service. Having said that, I must admit that the place is always crowded with workers and is very affordable - plus it is an adventure I guess for the brave
4
Ghandi Restaurant is very close Hotel Grand Chancellor and the food quality is very good at a very good price.You must try out non-veg delicacies along with Dosa.. esp. Mutton masala and Chicken curry with Dosa. They are simply irresistible.Enjoy your meal also. for 4 people it costed us about 15 sing dollars.
2
Thought i would put my head into here give it a try after reading the reviews . Well its deffanatly basic and a locals place to eat. You go in and when you sit yourself down along will come a banana leaf with a few starters and a popadom . Then as you eat with your hands they will ask you what main u would like ( i went with curried lamb ) they then plonk it on your leaf . Over view not worth going out of ur way for and sorry do not know how people gave this a goos scor

Have been regularly eating at Ghandi restaurant, get a chicken and veg meal packed to eat at home. Portions are good, great food. We love their quail eggs and chicken masala.It looks like a canteen, but then it is the food that matters so we get it packed to enjoy at home as it is always crowded. Definitely recommended if one wishes to try the south indian flavours in Singapor
4
A real place for good home cooked food. Really delicious and large portions. Very reasonably priced. No Hype, just simple good food that you can eat daily. Only thing is sometimes dishes are a little too spicy, so chose carefully. Dont worry about the ambience, concentrate on the food alone. Staying at Grand Chancellor consider this to be the hotel restaurant!!

During my exploring of Little India I was fortunate to have a local friend of mine who is a Singaporean resident for some 50 years. He took my by the Gandhi restaurant and told me it was his favorite place to eat. He informed me that the owner is the only one that cooks…if he is sick or on holiday the restaurant closes down.So taking his recommendation I decided to go there for lunch a few days later. The food was served on a banana leaf, rice is severed out of a large silver container…and then you have a choice of sauces to go over the rice. I ordered the curry lamb, curry chicken, and roasted fish. These are all small portions severed on the side. The food was wonderful. Full of flavor especially the curry lamb! I recommend this dish as a must have…simply wonderful! I do have to admit it takes some getting use to getting with your fingers…but no worries; a fork and spoon are available at the table for the ones that simply can’ put aside the western table manners.The price is great for the quality of food and the portion is generous as well. If you really want to experience authentic Indian cuisine then stop by the Gandhi restaurant

This was a great find with yummy food, cheap prices, local Indians and tourists queueing and then chowing down on great spicy curries and delicious accompaniments, washed down with sweet, hot chai. The serving sizes are decent, the turnover of customers is pretty fast as the service is efficient. Food is served on lush green banana leaves with all you can eat rice (if you opt for the rice option). The chicken curry was a bit spicy for me but I still ate it all up and sweated it out. 2 meals with 2 drinks came to S$15. We took away Indian desserts which each cost S$1 (but I wasn't a fan). Indian food while in Singapore is a must try for tourists, cos of the demographics of the population, and this is a pretty good place to have it
5
I loved everything I had, it was all delicious. I had mutton curry, daal, a variety of chutneys, rice, and bread. Food was served on banana leaves, forks and spoons provided, although most of the other diners were using their hands. The service was quick and efficient, although the water was a man of very few words, mostly just grunted. The atmosphere is a bit bleak, but dont let that deter you. Next time i'm in Singapore, I will definitely go there again. It was a great experience
5
This no-frills place is really packed during meal times. Got to wait for a table. It is interesting to watch how the indian workers queue up patiently for takeaways and the food variety is extensive. They give big servings too, I observed.We dined from banana leaves and the service is prompt and efficient. The curries are superb but rather spicy. Enjoyed the food very much and it is very cheap given the quality and taste of the food. Very good value for money. You will leave the place feeling satisfied
