Authentic Indian cuisines which tastes very good. I consider their specialty to be Kerala cuisines
I visit here for lunch once a week since last 10 months

Good food and reasonably priced by Singapore standards. Dishes taste authentic, and the flavours are clean and crisp, with freshly ground spices. The Ceylon Cyclone was a hit!

Wasn't great. We ordered a Dal Malkani, Chicken Tikka Masala and a Lamb Curry... All three curries had the same sauce and there was hardly any difference in flavour. The lamb chop starter was nice, but maybe not cooked enough. The servers were nice enough, but English was really lacking. Not the best Indian on the east cost.
4
Hospitality......Warm welcome given by the manager and served burning hot vegetarian food.Taste.......one word " pure and simple". Although not so many varieties to choose in vegetarian section but the one available really suits the taste buds.Damages......one of the reasonably priced place in Singapore, situated in a heritage market place. 50-55 Singapore dollars for family of four.Ambience......is simple and effective, drinks are served, people from all walks of life come to enjoy the food there.Suggestions..... although far from the main place, but travellers staying in Gaylang or katong could easily manage to come.

We recently visited the Mango Tree Indian restaurant.Pros:- The location is nice- The food is greatCons:-Waiting times are extremely long : we had to wait for over 45 minutes for a table of 4 on a saturday. During our long wait we saw half a dozen of Food Panda, Deliveroo and Uber Eat drivers come into the restaurant to pickup food. It seems that the kitchen crew is completely overloaded by internet orders and prioritize them over orders in the restaurant to avoid poor ratings and complains... The table next to ours also ended up complaining. We would most probably have waited longer by ordering the food through Deliveroo and eating at home since they usually show delivery of 25-35 minutes ...- Service : I would not say that the service was bad. They did their best to accommodate our requests (less spicy) but the overall service was certainly not very warm. No one greated us when we left and worse I didn't hear a single thank you after paying my bill ...- Price / Value : at 121 SGD for casual Indian food for 4 pax (including 2 your chidren) we will most probably not return. The food is nice and tasteful but the overall experience, waiting time and average service does not justify the cost

Solid Indian restaurant. All the favourites well executed. Veggie dishes like Palak Paneer and Kadai Sem were tasty and made us wish we’d ordered double. We also enjoyed the Chicken Makhani (butter chicken), the tandoori chicken, and the Kerala fish curry. The naan was fresh and hot and the paratha were flaky. Highly recommended if you’re in Katong.
5
I'm not fan of Indian Food but ai can definitely recommend this restaurant to everyone. The place looks decent, clean and doesn't smell. The food was great and made me want to come back for 2nd time to bring my family. It's their first time too! I would recommend the buttered chicken sooo yummy
5
First time at the new premises after the relocation from 112 Katong where we used to have the lunch buffet. The a la carte dishes are far superior, freshly cooked as we had to wait quite a while for our meal, but well worth the half hour or so wait as most tables downstairs were occupied and we saw Food Panda deliverers collecting too.Our waiter was most helpful and patient, informing us which dishes had milk or butter as one in our party of four is lactose-intolerant. We then ordered the Kerala mutton, tender and fragrant with spices and gravy, fish in banana leaf, also fresh and delectable, aloo gobi, and yellow dhal served in a cute copper bucket, all without dairy . The crisp garlic naan with some butter in the preparation came hot and heavenly from the oven. The two servings of fluffy basmati rice were the perfect base for this delicious meal.Complimentary pappadam, especially the spicy one, with their 3 dips of mint, coconut and chutney flavors were excellent starters.Fresh lime juice, with or without sugar is an ideal accompaniment to a spicy meal.Very impressed with the serene and tasteful decor, copper cutlery and general air of unhurried finesse, but please be prepared to wait on busy weekends

We had a late dinner at the Mango Tree when in Katong recently, which was nearby our hotel. Quite a lot of the local restaurants had closed by the time we were looking for dinner, so we were lucky they let us have the last orders just before 10pm. The restaurant is nicely decoarted and very clean, with good friendly service. We enjoyed their complimentary poppadoms and dips, before having the very tasty Mutton curry and Chicken sagani with rice, naan and cold beers. A very good local Indian restaurant and we'd happy return if in the area again
5
I wanted to eat vegetarian in the neighbourhood, but since the other restaurant only took cash, I came here and don't regret. This is a bit more elegant than some other restaurants here at Roxy square but prices are good. The service was discreet and quick, but still giving you the feeling that the food is being prepared fresh for you (which I believe). I had the paneer in tomato sauce and plain naan and it was yummie. Plus a Kingfisher beer - right temperature. Nice setting. Would definitely come here again.
4
We went there on Sunday evening with all family we enjoyed the dinner the ambience was good particularly from first floor there was one zinga special ordered by my granddaughter enjoyed the food
5
The new venue is crisp and bright, the staff are attentive and knowledgeable and food is very good with flashes of exceptional. The quality of the dahl is a personal test for Indian restaurants and the yellow dahl is great.
5
We had a wonderful dinner last week. The food tastes amazing and is very well priced. But the best part is such lovely staff - thank you for an amazing evening!

This place is an absolute charm with its excellent interiors and the warm and cozy environment. Please don't ignore this sublime place for not so alluring entry, and do give it a try for its succulent dishes, if you are, or not, bored with nearby Zaffron and the likes. We, a group of six, sat upstairs and enjoyed our meal downright. Unfortunately, four of us were vegetarians, so at least I had to let go the amazing non-veg options the restaurant offers. We ordered a couple of paneer varieties, yellow dal, almost all sorts of naan, some parathas(kulcha), and some appetizers. Everything was great, tasty, and was served decently. Huzza! for the 'Mango Naan' for it was not sweet, as I was expecting, but had just a hint of mango. The only small downside was that the staff was not five star. Nevertheless, I was also not excepting any unparallel service, but one of them had trouble understanding what we were trying to convey regarding the cake, which we had given to staff beforehand to celebrate one of the friend's special event. That being said, overall, staff were good and were in high spirits
4
In my three day tour to Singapore this was my 3rd Butter Chicken. We loved butter chicken and butter nan here. Complimentary papad was awesome. Best Indian Food restaurant from whatever we have tried in Katong Area. Prices are slightly on the higher side. So give it a try.
4
I have been to this place several times. This is one of the best go to the restaurant along with my friends and family. Certain dishes are good and they will make you come back. namely: appam, egg appam, Kerala parotta, mango mapas, jhinga lahsuni, any prawn dish, mutton(well done - please mention it). The ambiance is good and service is nice
5
We walked into Mango Tree by chance as the restaurant we were going to go to didn't really appeal to us when we arrived. The Mango Tree is obviously a new fit out ane very beautifully done with a lovely feeling and decor. We ordered a range of currys and starters and each of them were superb and I couldn't pick a winner. We had tandoori chicken and pakora entree followed by spinach aloo, prawn & chicken dishes. Everything was so well priced for the quality and the service from very staff member was fats and friendly. If I lived in Singapore this would become one of my favourite places to eat. Thank yo
5
We were worried for no reason when we heard the restaurant was moving. They have set up in a lovely shophouse near the old address and I'm sure business will boom as this restaurant was a hidden gem where it was in Katong I12. We recommend the mint tandoori fish, the baked garlic prawns, dosa, creamy raita, aloo gobi, the fresh naan. A really good choice if you have vegetarian requirements as we did.

We used to visit The Mango Tree at it's old location in the East Coast. Since we were in the Katong area, we decided to drop into their new (for us) location at 112 Katong.We went for the lunch buffet and therefore were able to try out some of their dishes.The Chicken Tikka was ok and a bit spicy. The tomato soup stood out with it's flavor. The rice pulao and paalak were pretty good. My wife tried the fish curry and found the fish to be a bit stale. The green beans dish was also fairly ok.We tried the gulab jamun and kheer for dessert and both were fairly good. The service was good and prompt
3
It was our wedding anniversary and we decided to have some Indian food. The food was alright. The service was good enough and we loved the ambience. It was a weekday so parking was no issue. Well back to the food. Loved the green mango curry and the "avial", a coconut milk infused mixed vegetable dish. Meat and fish dishes aplenty. Everything depends on your preference of cooking styles and level of spice as well as chilli.We ordered a meat dish, a fish dish, a prawn appetiser, 2 vegetable dishes, a vegetable curry, rice for one, naan for one, spring-hoppers, appam and a bottle of wine. Total bill for three was S$171 or thereabouts, inclusive of GST. A good place to try out
4
Excellent value for the lunch buffet. Good selection for veg and non-veg alike. Also nice and quiet which is always welcome on a weekend
5
I have recommended this to friends. great service. Nice seating area. I sat outdoors for cocktails. They make a great singapore sling.
4
We use to visit this this restaurant when it was located on the on the east coast some years ago and the food was really good.The comprehensive menu is impressive but every body was taking the buffet, so went and followed them. The cost S$ 25 is very good value for money. There was about ten dishes to chose from. It is odd that the waiter has to explain details of each dish as there are no cards describing the dishes. Nonetheless,everything we had was very good, no complaints. The house red wine is fine and wallet friendly.They have a private dinning room for 8 which looks very comfortable and a balcony if you enjoy eating outing outdoors. My wife really enjoyed the food so we will be returning

The Mango Tree Coastal Restaurant at Katong I12 is a peaceful oasis in a busy city. Located in a mall off a busy street, it provides a conducive location for mindfulness dining and conversation. The food is a bit pricier than other Northern Indian restaurants, but the quality and authenticity takes some beating, and the atmosphere is great
4
This restaurant has been around for well over a decade, which is a testimony to the quality of the food. Dishes are very tasted and service is prompt. We have tried virtually the entire menu over time, and haven't been disappointed so far. Try the dal makhani, jinga lasooni, and their in-house creation, the mango naan.
3
The costal food of southern India is one of the best the country has to offer but Mango Tree does not do justice to the cuisine of the region.When it started it was a great place but look like they have lost the way. We were there for a buffet lunch and it was disappointing specially for the price they charge.There are better options in Singapore. Not a fan of this place.
4
You are at once greeted by the warm and friendly team member as you step in. We were given a choice of indoor and outdoor seats. The decor struck me as authentic with Indian masks and a quilt hung up on the walls. The entire restaurant is tastefully done up. For the evening, candles were placed on every table. The ceiling lights could do with a little dimming down though, for that romantic feel.Dinner was the Aloo Palak (potato spinach curry), Chicken Chapora (chicken pieces simmered in kottayam masala), Lemon Basmati Rice and for starters, the chicken tikka. All 4 dishes were beautifully cooked and tasted wonderful. We were delighted with our choice of dishes. The meal ended with the obligatory Gulab Jamu and fresh cut mango slices, both served in copper cups.What a perfect way to end the weekend
3
Pros :1. Good ambience . Traditional cutlery 2. Convenient location - katong mall 3. Indoor and outdoor seatingCons 1. The food isn't very authentic . I have grown up eating malayalee cuisine and the food here doesn't even come close . It's not bad , but nothing to rave about . The flavor component is definitely missing .
4
There are so many restaurants to choose from in this area.We decided on Indian. Very enjoyable. Mixed tandoori entree and butter chicken for main between the two if us. Butter chicken was excellent with a lovely flavor. Garlic naan needed a bit more cooking and less garlic but with the butter chicken sauce was delicious.Indeed the restaurant was empty except us and one guy who ordered takeaway.A tad expensive at $80 but hey this is Singapore. We would certainly return
3
A cosy restaurant on the east coast road is known for coastal cuisine of India along with north Indian cuisine with limited veg options. The pakoras were too oily though the naan breads were soft and also the paneer tikka. They give baskets of papads along with coriander chutneys and pickle which were goo
5
This exceptional enterprise is sincerely sublime!
The bill of fare is wide ranging and caters to all.
From our canapés to our entrées we were thoroughly appeased. A must for all to endeavour!
1
By far the worst indian meal I ever had. The star above is for the complimentary icewater. The bread and the naan however were okay.
4
We have chosen some dishes, mutton, gamba's, chicken and fish combined with some rice and naan. Very taste and well spiced. If you like Indian, this is a must try on level 1 of I12 Katong mall.
4
This place serves some excellent Kerala cuisines along with egg and mushroom varieties. The appam, fish curry, garlic mushroom were excellent.
1
We wanted to try but it was a big mistake. This restaurant serves stale food and is very expensive. All I got was bad stomach. The restaurant was empty and probably the reason why it serves stale food. We ordered 3 lassies, two side dishes and two rotis and one starter. The price was S$87. Ok if the food was good. The coconut based Kerala food could tempt you but the food is stale and spoiled coconut could lead trouble

$29nett/pax for Sunday lunch buffet, came in a group of 5 friends.Free flow of fruit punch drink that tasted sweet, slightly carbonated that I was thinking if they may have added Sprite in it. The drink was refreshing. We loved it.There was tomato soup that we all loved it too, tangy and peppery.4 non-veg dishes: Tandoori chicken, chicken curry, fish curry, mutton curry4 veg dishes: aloo Gobi, palak paneer, yellow dal, and another I can't remember.2 types of naan only though, with white rice and biryani rice.Gulab jamun, mango pudding, fruits, some other cold small dishes.For $29nett/pax, the quality of the food was higher than expected. As listed above, the spread was not extensive and as dishes were served in small tin/silver pots instead of the larger ones we usually see in buffets, they look less. But the restaurant staff and Chef replenish the dishes quite quickly. Interior was bright with wide and tall glass windows and let in plenty of sunlight in. As shown in some of the pictures other reviewers have posted, there is also an alfresco setting and one or two private room. Ambience was generally decent and comfortable. Nothing much to complain about.Only slight down experience was when I went earlier than my reservation timing to ask the staff of I could pay first, before I asked the question the staff assumed I was going to request for something difficult and I could see his face went immediately impatient on me. I was a little bit taken aback but when he heard I wanted to pay first, he immediately treated me much nicer to compensate his rudeness. Just this bit got me thinking 'man, this guy is so not nice! Either that or he must have had such a bad day before me'. Other than that, the staffs were generally nice to us. They also agreed to keep my frozen yogurt birthday cake till after the lunch which I appreciate it very much. They also served up plates and cutting knife for the cake which I thought was out of the buffet service and they gladly were thoughtful for us. There was a good lady staff who also offered to take pictures for us, she was very nice.For the chicken curry, fruit punch, tomato soup, affordable price and comfy ambience, I will certainly come back again
4
We went with friends for dinner and had a cozy private alcove to ourselves.The staff are very efficient and welcoming,and we soon had our drinks the menus and some poppadums and dips.We ordered a selection of dishes including chicken,fish,meat,a paneer,some rich and creamy dhal,raita and a mango curry.plus some hoppers and the most light and tasty garlic naan I have had in a while.I do find the food quite rich but is is very flavoursome.It is definately worth a visit
4
I went there with colleagues and the food and the service were excellent . We tried more items on the menu this time and the restaurant went out of its way to make sure that small dietary requirements were attended to Masala soda is definitely worth trying - though the mango Kulfi can be passed
4
I visited mango tree after a while for dinner ... But the taste has not changed and the menu remains the same. Service was good and prices overall for the quality and ambience were reasonable. Masala soda (non alcoholic beverage) was something new I tried and is recommended
4
This is one of our often frequented restaurants in this area. The food is great with idiyappam and appam very good. Their combination with Dal Makhani may sound strange but is out of the world! We can keep going back to this place just for this!We tried their paneer dish and were disappointed. What seemed like Paneer cubes were actually Tofu
5
The food quality is great - they try their best in terms of meeting the best standards of service. The Kerala paratha, ishtu and appam are very good and brings me back to this restaurant when I am around this area
5
This was a surprise find in 112 Katong shopping centre. Loved that you had the opportunity to sit on the balcony overlooking the passers by or inside in the cool and peaceful decorative surrounds. The customer service was great. Very attentive waiters. Food was amazing, especially the crab, and the mango naan.
4
Had lunch at this cost restaurant recently. One of the better Indian restaurants I have been. The food was tasty, with just enough spice, and not too salty like most Indian food can be. Liked the prawns which were fresh and crunchy, and the fish wrapped in banana leaf
4
I met with friends at Mango Tree over their lunch buffet. The restaurant is opened by a Chinese couple and offers Indian coastal food. Albeit limited, I loved their variety in food from Mumbai cuisine to Goan curries and Kerala dishes. The staff are friendly and the food is delicious. The balcony area is especially nice after a slight drizzle
4
The food is awesome in this place and the taste is not because it is greasy (my yardstick for Indian food). Went for a business buffet lunch. Price was reasonable, a great plus in ever expensive Singapore. The variety was nice and taste subtle. The only bugbear would be location - maybe they should have been more central
5
Now I am not local, but wow what an amazing meal. It was a little quiet, but the service was slick, the food was simply amazing authentically Southern Indian. I am a great lover of Indian food and this is up there as the best I have ever had. Try for yourselves, you won't be disappointed
5
I am a frequent visitor to Mango Tree. I am living in Singapore for last 7 yrs now and being a foodie I have tried almost all indian restaurants in Singapore. This is certainly amongst one of the best in them. Value for money, great ambience, nice cocktails, very good taste and qaulity of food
5
We love to come here when staying in the Joo Chiat area. Not only for the wonderful food, but also for the lovely balcony seating available. The service is friendly and attentive and the dishes different from what you find in most of the other Indian restaurants. Everything here is a bit more refine
2
This probably was the best South Indian food we have had in Singapore! And was definitely the worst in service!Everything was slow and delayed.The fact that the food was awesome did reduce the pain and thus the 2 stars in review Training is definitely needed to make the staff capable of handling the slightly busy period on a weekend
4
We had lunch here during our last Singapore vacation and enjoyed the food very much indeed!There is a good soup as starter and a number of dishes from tandoory chicken to beef curry, vegetarian curries, tofu, spinach, etc... and for dessert there is a fresh fruit salad.The staff is mainly friendly and helpful even though some do not appear too cheerful.Senior citizens get a preferential price. Surely a place to visit for all those who enjoy South Indian food
3
Avoid if you can find a better one instead.
Lunch Buffet is 24++
A lot of things from tables, buffay utensils, servings can be improved. the looks that it gives from outside is different from what we had it in.
4
Really good food with a nice ambience and reasonable price. Loved it!
I am forced to write at least 100 characters.
5
The best Indian restaurant in Singapore in my opinion. The coastal twist is fresh but not overpowering. The service is great and the outside seating is quite nice.
5
If you like Indian food, you'll love this place!I had a lunch buffet here and the food was certainly one of the best north Indian foods I've had in Singapore. They had a variety of dishes - both veg & non-veg (as you would expect in a buffet). Unlike other buffet menus, each preparation had its own distinct flavour and it shows that the chef really knows about the cuisine :) The gulab jamun, pineapple salad & dal makhani are a must try.The ambience and service too is very good and I would like to give an additional star in my review just for the copper/brass traditional themed cutlery!I wish they had more branches, since this location seemed a bit remote and hidden
4
We discovered MangoTree quite by chance since it is hidden away at the Katong Mall. Must say was plesantly surprised by the decor, the on-time and polite service and the finger licking food. Everything from the start to the finish was a perfect South Indian delight. I wish it was more visible and we had discovered the place earlier. Looking forward to more meals here :
5
So if someone ask me whats the best Indian food in Singapore, I have no doubt its @ 'Mango Tree Coastal Restaurant'.We have been regularly visiting this "Gem" in singapore for authentic food in a fine dine ambiance.Manager Vinod always give warm welcome and he even recommend which is the good comination of Dishes. They serve nice mocktails as well.Kerala food (South of India) is my favorite. Loved their Appams with Aleppery Fish Curry (not very spicy). Used to order Meen pollichathu and Mutton Fry which are so tempting.They make excellent Naans which I often take with Murgh Makhani(Chicken)Masala Chaya (Tea) is very traditional and healthy.Waiting for my next dinner there with my wife who also loves the food there
4
My husband and I i ate here and really enjoyed our meal!! We wanted to go somewhere nearby that was chilled out but still good quality. We both love Indian food and when deciding what to order our server was very helpful and advised us on the dishes and was not pushy in any way, trying to get us to order more etc! We had the tandoori platter with mango naan and a salad dish plus we also ordered mussel masala starter and the amount was ok but if you're looking for a bigger heavier dinner out you would need to order from the mains. We had some red wine which was their house pour and very good. Service was prompt and polite. Inside the decor was simple and not fussy and they have a comfortable outdoor seating area. Very nice ambience and perfect for couples or chilled out food with friends ! I highly recommend here!We both liked this place and will be back!
4
Mango tree offers good value with good choice of buffet. Coming from the UK we missed the curries there but then found this restaurant and have frequented it often. We've recommended the place to several friends who agree and enjoy the food. The naan is freshly made and the staff even provide a freshly made basket to the table once the supply has run out. Nice ambience very cosy and bumped into some local artistes who also frequent the place
5
We read some reviews in tripadvisor, and headed straight to this place. We were living at The Village hotel, Katong and were desperately needing some authentic Indian food. We are basically from Kerala, and nothing short of a Kerala cuisine could satisfy us that noon. We were living close to I12 mall, Katong.. From the notice board, we learned that the restaurant is located at the 3rd floor ,and there it was..We were quite impressed by the ambience, and when we learned that they are having a buffet lunch, we were double happy.. We tasted some yummy Indian curries and rice + naan . Even the tomato soup tasted yum . The one that pleased us the maximum was The Fish Moilee, which was really good. All the guys in the restaurant were extremely helpful . The buffet costed us 19 dollars plus tax per pax .We are not much concerned about the amount as far as we are provided with some really good food ; and they impressed us well .. .Would certainly recommend it to all who wish to have Indian cuisine and are somewhere in Katong area..Don't have the impression that they have only Kerala cuisine.. They have a big list to choose from. include all the dishes you need ...
4
This restaurant serves a high standard of Indian food. Despite its location in a shopping mall, it manages to provide an enjoyable 'outside' dining experience with a calm ambience and a garden-like feel. Even the patrons indoors are shielded from the view of shoppers and shops in a well-decorated area. The food portions aren't large, but appropriate for fine dining. The server was careful to point out that a dish had many fish bones before we ordered it. We had a great dinner here
5
Good value for money. Not to spicy but very we'll balanced. Went there with some international and local friends. Only the menu is quite short.
4
Great food, friendly and effective service. The restaurant however feels a bit soulless and cushions would be a great addition to the chairs.
4
Had appams and Kerala paratha and Avial and stew - better than my expectations - starters was just ok ; so if u want to enjoy appams and coastal curries - a great place to go
4
We have been there for lunch several times during week days and the lunch buffet spread is excellent! Fantastic food at a great price, coupled with friendly service and we highly recommend this place.
5
We have eaten here twice, once for dinner and once for lunch and were very pleased by the good food and the friendly service. Portions are adequate for us but maybe small for big eaters! Try the mutton curry and the bindhi vegetables!
4
Had the Sunday lunch buffet. Very good value for money with a good variety of food ranging from chicken masala to mutton to fish to daal to palaak & vegetable. Fresh naans were excellent. For desert they served delicious mango pudding & gulab jamoon. They have an outside & inside sitting area. On a pleasant day the outside covered area has better atmospher
4
We have been searching for a good 'local' curry house in Katong for 4 years now and The Mango Tree is the latest in a long line of high hopes.On this occasion we were not disappointed. The food was good, a little heavy on the seafood side but it is largely coastal cuisine so to be expected, the prices reasonable and service was with a smile.it was quiet on a week day night but the following Saturday we passed by and it was very busy,The meat seemed to be lean and tender, not the very fatty gristle that many local Indian restaurants serve.It's not quite the Great Kathmandu in Didsbury but we can't have everything :)Worth a try
5
Situated in the 112 Katong mall, we discovered this Indian restaurant by chance and can highly recommend it. The menu has a broad choice of dishes incl. meat, fish, seafood, vegetarian and the food is really nice (spicy but not too much to bear). Prices are reasonable and the staff is most welcoming. The decor of the restaurant is very tasteful and you have the choice to either eat in the airconditioned interior or outside on the balcony where they have ceiling fans
3
Service is friendly and very good at this restaurant. Taste of alcoholic drinks is inconsistent. The food is good but portions are small compared to price. They have a great promotion for early diners. Order one - get two food and drink orders including alcoholic drinks except wine. I recommend this restaurant during the "two for" promotion hours. Food is good but price is not reflective of portion size
3
The food was not bad but it just wasnt there; the appams were a tad burnt both times, the kerela paranthas didnt taste fresh, the pappad was under-done, the coconut chutney was watery and very non appetising to look at. The curries were good we had one chicken & one fish both reccomended by the server but not as fiery spicey as the server had promised them to be since fiery spiciness is a hall mark of this cuisine. Service was also not bad (again like for food am refraining from using the word good) there was some inconsistancy on turn around of the orders.The Decor and Ambience were certainly nice! Its also located in a nice buzzy mall but inside the restsurant there is no trace of outside noise and they also have alfresco dining choice something which my wife loves. Pricing was ok though i felt they were charging a few dollars extra for the soft drinks then what the comparative restaurants charge. We had Mango lassi must have been nice judging by how fast my son finished it!Overall i will perhaps go again sometime to know the place better..
1
we had a terrible experience today. We ordered Tandoori platter and we were served with terrible food which include written prawns n boiled fish instead of Tandoori........it is not worth it going there after seeing the review posted. ....probably the review posted themselves
5
Great location - right on the water; Excellent service; And above all, food that is consistently delicious......I've been there a couple of times now and if you're a vegetarian, I would highly recommend the Avial, Vegetable Ishtu, Appam and Idi Appams. Absolutely fantastic!!
5
Mango tree serves a wide variety of Indian Cuisine ranging from the Northern to the Southern part of India. The dishes at Mango tree were phenomenon and it complements with the ambience of the place. My mates and I were there for our friend's baby shower and we had 1) prawn soup ( to die for- have to try) 2) curries 3) bbq seafood (prawns/fish).The produce at mango tree were fresh and they were cooked/bbq-ed to perfection. This is an absolute must if you are craving for Indian....its indeed YUM. Highly recommended
5
Menu offers variety and some delicious signature dishes.Staff is very friendly and greets you with a smile always.I opted for some north indian dishes even after knowing it's a coastal restaurant, however food was pretty nice particularly their achari chicken tikka & paneer makhani.Mutton curry & carrot pudding is also worth a try there
5
This is a true gem: whether you normally like Indian food or not. Mango Tree brings quality and genuine regional Indian cuisine to Singapore. Did not mean to go to an Indian restaurant in Singapore originally, but this restaurant is a class on its own and stands above the rest. They not only offer a modern yet cozy environment (they have a spacious alfresco dining area as well), but also offer super fresh seafood cooked with great precision and care. They offer both northern and southern Indian cuisine and the dishes are just delicious and almost unforgettable. Prices are reasonable. It’s one of my highlights during my Singapore trip. Try the garlic crab – it’s marinated with garlic and chili and is served with steamed vegetables. The spicy shrimp soup is fabulous – so full of aroma and rich in freshness that is mouth watering just thinking about it now. The snacks such as samosa and idiyappam (steamed rice noodles topped with Kerala styled fish curry) is cooked to perfection. Their chicken grills are also fabulous.I was truly impressed with Mango Tree’s owner, Mr. Chin’s insistence of serving nothing but the best and the freshest. E.g. their lime juice uses India imported lime. Don’t miss this super restaurant!NB: They moved recently to #03-11, 112 Katong Mall

I am food lover and I thought I know India food very well.I visited The Mango Tree now @ I12 East Coast Road #03-11 Singapore 428802 and it have change my view about India Food.This restaurant offers a fusion between the northern, southern and coastal sea food.It offers you a wide range and new creation of india food that you do not commonly found in Singapore.. If you are a food lover - This is a MUST TRY !!! You will never regret.. I will be going back for more.
2
Dear food lovers,I would like to inform that the place of this restaurant has changed. It is now situated at #03-11, 112 Katong, East Coast Road and we have been to this place 2 weeks back.Food was good but was not something that is not available elsewhere in Singapore. Prices were at the higher end and I felt little expensive. Service was not good since we ordered couple of things and inspite the restaurant quite empty the staff forgot to bring or did not want to bring.I would not recommend this hotel if you are just going out for a family meal or with friends. Since it is inside a mall and like a very normal restaurant

My first experience of East Coast eating in Singapore was the Mango Tree, as recommended in a tourist guide. I loved it from day one with tasty, reasonably priced Southern Indian food and friendly, courteous service.When the Mango Tree moved from the East Coast, and literally under a Mango tree (!) to a busy new shopping Mall, Katong 112, we weren't sure we'd visit again. I don't like crowds or busy streets and do my best to avoid them!However, I finally braved it and was glad I did. The decor is simply lovely and there is outside eating under fans. The view is not quite the same with the absence of the Mango tree and shoreline, but it's on the 2nd floor (level 3) and does look out over an old colonial house and a swimming pool, so we still got our water view!They have extended the menu and now also serve a buffet style lunch. The service is still friendly and courteous and they assured us they would be returning to the East Coast once it has been renovated in 2013. In the meantime they continue to serve good food at reasonable prices.I definitely recommend it

Having stumbled across the new Mango Tree Restaurant in 112 Katong Plaza a couple of weeks ago we decided to give it a try. This is a new branch of the original Mango Tree in ECP and is a much more substantial enterprise with much more space, private rooms and a nice large balcony with overhead fans. We had a table out on the balcony and were served by smartly dressed waiters in authentic Indian garb.For starters we ordered squid Molaga, an old favourite from the original place, which was as good and spicy as ever, and Tava Jinghdi (spicy prawns), which were very tasty and unusual. The main courses were sadly marred by some very tough tandoori lamb chops though, and as the service on the balcony was somewhat erratic we couldn't attract anyone's attention to send them back. The chops apart the owners are obviously making a big effort to make this place work and if they can improve the standards of service could be on to a winner. One other thing, we noticed another table serving themselves from what we subsequently learnt was a buffet inside. No-one informed us this was an option, but something we will try on our next visit

Mango Tree was recommended to us by a friend who has lived in Singapore for 10 years, and for a good reason. The food was fantastic, service excellent and the location a place where I would not have thought of going otherwise as a tourist. I can warmly recommend this place
