Feels like home even if it's your first time, and credit goes to the owner Marco. He cultivates a great sense of camaraderie within his team, which also extends to customers. Ask him for a bespoke cocktail; you're guaranteed to remember it.

If you say I'm Singapore far and wide come to jig a jig, you will follow thirst for good drink but you will stay for the fib, the regulars and Marco with the peps behind the bar, Marco tells stories and everyone of them need to be heard. The rang from tails that will make you laugh loud to those that will make you feel at home. If there is one place in Singapore you should spend a night or two it is most definitely this one

You will be treated like family when you walk into Jigs. They are so welcoming and warm, and will always take care of you. I just happened upon it while looking for dinner and it made my weekend in Singapore so much better and more memorable. Marco is wonderful as is the rest of the staff. The patrons are real, cool people who made my trip worth it. Thank you everyone at jig a jig for a new incredible weekend!
