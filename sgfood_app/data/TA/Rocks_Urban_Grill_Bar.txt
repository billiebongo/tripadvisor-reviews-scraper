Foods are average but generous portion, atmosphere not exactly good although boost a view of the MBS. Services are very good though.

Easy to miss this restaurant as the only one upstairs in the Sail. Nice food and very friendly staff. Lovely atmosphere and view. Good for either a casual lunch/dinner or something more formal.

Love the natural day light streaming in; tables are well spaced out giving you room to manoeuvre and quiet enough to hold a decent conversation

Good place for a business lunch when it's not very crowded. Will recommend. Prices are reasonable too.

Its a nice place. Had the set lunch - didn't find the food exceptional; i.e the soup was mildly tasty but the fish was good. Price on the high side. But again this is my preference and experience. Service was good.

I have to be frank on this, as this is a high-end restaurant. I heard good review on them thatâ€™s why we decided to splurge for a lunch. We ordered the set lunch, and really had to return the chowder - it was blend and stale. Chicken was tough and greasy. Nothing great and there are better restaurants around the area.

I made a booking. Called in and was told that the set lunch menu has refreshed. Requested for a copy to be emailed to me for a business meeting but restaurant did not do so. Called again and got bounced off to another email. Again, no news. Will be changing venue for my business meeting! Thanks a lot guys. LOUSY SERVICE and DO NOT RECOMMEND

Situated on the 2nd floor of The Sail @ Marina Bay, it's quite a comfortable place to escape the hustle & bustle of Raffles Place.Highly recommend the sirloin steak and pan seared Atlantic cod for mains. Chocolate fondant with vanilla ice cream is ideal for sweet endings.Service was prompt and efficient. Will be returning soon

Food was ok and ambience was ok. Would have liked it if we were given the 3rd floor seats which gives the true view without the trees

Table was adequately spaced and good ambience. Service was inconsistent depending on the person serving you. Value was average. Would only revisit for special occasion.

I like the nice setting and ambience. The menu is simple but cooking is good. Overall I enjoyed the lunch there.

The French maitre d' clearly sets the tone and service level at the restaurant. He is welcoming and is available with his staff always without hovering or being intrusive. The food is spectacular and the portions really generous. Can't wait to go back!

Our table was thoughtfully angled to face the Marina Bay area where there would be fireworks after the countdown. They even gave us a party pack with party poppers, whistles and whatnots.We had the New Year's Eve dinner set which was good. The starters were great, and our steak came in a generous portion. My partner's steak was a little bit too rare, but they remedied it when we brought it up. The dessert was very nice too.Service was excellent the entire night and we enjoyed the dinner experience there.Diners should definitely consider Rocks for their dinner place especially when there will be fireworks on display at the Marina Bay area

The food was okay but not great. We had the New years Eve Dinner and had the Fois Gras, baked Salmon and a Desert. It was okay, the atmosphere in the restaurant was not very extraordinary. However the price was very reasonable for this 3 course dinner for this festivity dinner

We went for lunch since the location was super convenient to go in the CBD. Ambience of the restaurant is good, as is the service. We had the festive lunch set - ricotta salad and smoked salmon for appetizers, pumpkin pasta and fish for mains and 2 types of chocolate desserts. The food tasted average, nothing spectacular - no fancy dips or dressing for the salads, simple presentation and taste for the mains. One dessert had some cinnamon cookie crumble element which was super hard to bite into the bigger chunks, but the other dessert was nice. Overall I felt that this place is good for business lunches given its location.

Quiet ambience, business set lunch- and if you choose the chicken you could bounce it off the wall. Why they feel pre-cooking chicken till its rubber and expect diners to think it's fresh because it has grill marks is beyond me. At least try to heat it till its hot- lukewarm/cold gives us a clue it wasn't close to freshly cooked. Luckily they have stale bread rolls on the table so you don't have to be entirely hungry.

Tried the set lunch. Great selection and the portion served was just right. My colleague and I chosed the chicken and sea bass for our main course respectively. The chicken was tender with really good mash potato. The sea bass was cooked just right, and very juicy. The service waiters were very attentive. The serving of the starter salad, main course and lastly dessert and coffee was all carefully timed. Overall experience was great

 I like the bright , fresh and unpretentious ambience at urban rocks . The pizzas here are wood- fired - the limestone pizza is my all time favourite . I like the salads here - there are light yet satisfying . The rocks salad with pumpkin and feta cheese is good . I've tried various starters too - crab cake, grilled portobello mushroom and parmigiana are all good . I hVe been here several times for lunch . Whilst the lunch sets at $44 better value than a la carte options, there are just too many dining plAces around this area - be it customs house, boon tat street, Mbfc or Asia square . If you are not at one raffles quay, the location of the restaurant, tucked away on the second floor of The Sail , may not be obvious .Funny enough, this is why I come here - as it doesn't get too crowded .

If you want to take guests to a restaurant which will blow them away this is the one. Great food, great service and close to the business district. The food is amazing and well prepared with just what you want. Make sure you book this one. Enjoy
