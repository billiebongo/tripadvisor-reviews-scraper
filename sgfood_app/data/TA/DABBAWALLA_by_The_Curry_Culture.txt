Good funky little restaurant on Robertson Quay. Service very good, and food was really nice. They were very accommodating with making the kids curries milder.

Enjoyed a night out with standard selection of Indian dishes. I had chicken jalfrezi which was flavoursome and hot. The onion bahjis were delicious. Meal for two including puddings was Â£76 as service and gst added so more pricey than UK venues. Good location at Robertson Quay and easy to find.

I went with my family today for dinner. I was looking forward to this dinner because the last time I was in Singapore some 7 months back I had been to this place and we fully enjoyed our meal. Delicious it was ! My wife wrote a nice review on trip advisor.as well. But this time around I was throughly disappointed. The quality of cooking seems to have deteriorated. Then there was this loud songs playing full blast. Boss, this is not a disc. It is a restaurant right ? Dinner should be enjoyed in a quiet atmosphere. My wife requested the attendant to lower the volume but he did not. We some how finished our food and rushed out of the place. Boss, if you have to play songs then play ghazals. You have to be sensitive to people who may not like loud music. The least you can do is lower the volume.Evenings are meant for soothing music.My evening was wasted . I will never go back to this place

We visited Dabbawalla on our first night in Singapore and were drawn to the vibe of the place, very laid back and colourful. We had butter chicken, lamb korma and rice for mains which was delicious. They also give complimentary pappadums which were beautiful. It was a nice meal however quite expensive. The dishes are quite small considering the price and we weren't full afterwards which was disappointing
4
This is a good little Indian restaurant just in one of the side streetsat Robertson Quay. Good for a proper Indian fix. Staff are friendly and the service is good. Would visit again.

I had a chance to have a couple of meals at Dabbawalla. Keep in mind that during the weekdays, they are open only for dinner. On a good note, I believe they open at 18:00 for those looking for an early meal like myself.The restaurant is easy to find and there is parking right in the basement. On both occasions, we sat outside as the weather was good.We tried the papdi chaat and the ragda pattice. Both were a wee bit spicy.We also tried the sheekh kebab but my daughter found it a bit on the spicy side as well.One of the main reasons we were tempted to go here was that they had 'Frankies' on the menu and it brought back some childhood memories.On our first visit, we tried the small chicken frankie but it was nothing like the real thing. It was basically a flat kathi roll. It tasted good but we were expecting something else.We ordered a garlic naan and it was pretty decent.For desert, we tried the Bailey's kulfi which was just ok.The food was tasty and of a good quality. The service is very friendly and non intrusive.I'd go again
4
I chose this restaurant based on ratings from trip advisor and want disappointed. The service was very quick and I enjoyed my lamb dish. The restaurant was busy which I always find to be a good sign. I was asked three times if everything was ok, twice by a gentleman who seemed to be a manager/proprietor. Told him I had visited as a result of ratings on trip advisor to which he replied that he was grateful for all the reports received
5
Craving good Indian food, we were recommended to try this restaurant and we were so glad we did. The food was fantastic. We were given a couple of small poppadoms and dips whilst we were waiting for our meals, and as we still had dips left the staff happily gave us extra poppadoms. Our Curry's were fabulous - especially the chicken tikka - thick tasty sauces with lovely fresh chicken, and a nice garlic nan bread on the side. We will definitely visit again next time we are in Singapore
5
Our first night in magical Singapore got off to a great start at this wonderful little restaurant. I loved their list of rules written on the chalkboard - just a little chuckle to set the tone. Everything we ordered was fresh, well-prepared and tasty. The servers were very helpful and cheery.There were six of us and we tried a large variety of the snacks and dishes. The servings were quite small for the price, but then, Singapore is expensive, so we felt it was worth it.Overall, it was a very positive way to begin our visit to Singapore.I just wish they had a Vancouver outlet...
5
We wanted to find a nice place to eat near our hotel and found this gem in Robertson Quay. Lovely atmosphere, delicious food and friendly service. Very well priced and we recommend you give it a try.
5
Awesome food, not spicy at all, melts on tongue and loveliest of all, they serve you quick. Appreciate hospitable and charming Michelle, friendly and funny Chaubeyji and most importantly Patel, the chef
5
While walking by the river in Singapore I chanced to see a Restaurant called Dabbawalla. I walked to see the menu and the restaurant really impressed me with the modern decor and friendly staff.The menu has primarily the North Indian dishes like the tikkas and the curries. They began the dinner with some poppadums with three chutneys which were super delicious. The chicken tikka was made well and was succulent. I also ordered for yellow daal and mutton. The Indian bread was also nice and crisp. I would highly recommend this restaurant if you have an Indian food craving
4
Delicious authentic tasting Indian food but slightly sterile environment. Service was also far too intense with the waiter watching our every move which was very off putting!! For me this place was just all about the food which is what I’ve based my rating on. If you’re looking for good quality Indian but aren’t so bothered about ambience you can’t go far wrong with this place.
4
We inadvertently found ourselves in Singapore after our holiday in Bali was cancelled due to the volcanic eruption. The Singapore Airlines magazine encounter from Yangon to Singapore touted Dabbawallah as the new place to try . After two weeks of Burmese cuisine ( delightful in it's own right ) , we were yearning for something spicy with a chilled beer. Dabbawallah was the perfect place to try. We ordered the Maa Dhall, paneer masala and lamb vindaloo ( spiciness can dialed up from 1 -10 ) . The owner suggested 8 and it was spicy but I could go further. Got some extra sauce at level 10 and it was perfect for me! For chilli lovers --this will tingle not senses and rest assured it will NOT kill you! I could taste the vinegar based spice sauce even with the chillies added. Tender morsels of lamb too. Before I dived into the above , I sensibly tasted the Dhall and paneer with the roti ordered and the balance of flavor and spices were perfect for us. A Guru beer ( which I last tried in India many years ago ) appropriately chilled was great with the vindaloo. All in all , a great place to try out. Not cheap though. The above with Arita and rice cost us about $ 100. Would certainly recommend this place and would visit it agai
4
It was our 10th anniversary and decided quite late to dine out. Found this place on TripAdvisor and wanted to give it a try. The food here was quite good. Service is quick and every one around is very welcoming. I Guess we have one more amazing resturant to have north Indian food in singapore. Kids loved the paneer makhanwala... and overall it was a delight. As we already had some evening snacks didn’t order to much.. may be next time.. The host was very humble and did have a great conversation. If looking for north Indian food this is a must place to try.
5
There are some seriously good eats in Robertson Quay at the moment. Publico, Decker, Super Loco and this gem -- Dabbawalla. We had several dishes including the chicken tikka and the Indian nachos (can't remember the name) amongst others and they were all awesome. Be sure to also try the extra strenght beers they have in large cans
4
This restaurant forms part of Curry Culture (with the original restaurant located around Orchard Road). This branch is positioned among lots of other restaurants and bars with most of the seating outside. The food is well-cooked and can be spiced according to your taste. The portion sizes are good and the complimentary poppadoms and pickles were very welcome. The menu is extensive and the service good. There are plenty of places to eat in this area, and this is a good choice
5
We thoroughly enjoyed our visit to Dabbawalla. I had the railway mutton curry and my wife had butter chicken both of which were delicious. We had saffron rice and roti to accompany our meal and again these were lovely.The staff were very helpful and friendly and I can highly recommend this restaurant
5
Really enjoyed their speciality butter chicken. Delicious with peshwari naan and a cold Kingfisher. Service was fast and friendly staf
4
Had butter chicken for a dinner with naan bread. Dabbawalla says that this is their traditional receipt.Chicken was just perfect! Actually one of the best butter chickens I have had.Service was fast and friendly.Dabbawalla is bit pricy. However after a 12 hour flight, this was an easy and good spot to have a dinner
5
Forget the rest this is the best, Thanks to the team who never seem to depress. The atmosphere is great, it's chilled out, food is fantastic and the cocktails and drinks are all inspired to match that. Thanks Mate
5
Me and my wife really love Indian food and eat it most of the time, the staff very helpful and warm hearted and considerate. The food was a little lacking..nan bread very good.The various curries were too runny and too much salt.Regardless the staff and atmosphere was excellent
5
Went with my wife mid-week. The food was great but the service was excellent. Prabha the manager went out of his way to make us feel welcome and was very flexible with the menu, accommodating any little requests we had. We will be back :
5
We had dinner twice and both times the food and service was excellent Good choice on the extensive menu with very friendly helpful staff who happily help with your choice
4
Came here with friends and whilst is part of a mall / parade of restaurants it's a great little spot. Just located by the canal it serves great food and provides great service.Watch out for the (s) rating as these are super spicy! However I really enjoyed the meal. Great flavour and great quality of ingredients. A good find!
5
Very nice and cosy atmosphere, courteous staff, good service,tasty food.we love the cocktail drinks too,very tasty food
5
We went here based on reviews from Tripadvisor. Firstly it was a little hard to find because it is branded as Dabbawalla but the reviews on TA are in the name Curry Culture. Once we had that established, it was a great experience. Very good service and recommendations and the flavours from the food were wonderful. We were very attentively looked after and have no hesitation in recommending this restaurant
5
Personally I recommend this restaurant to all my friends and family , the have amazing staff very kind hearted people and very clean place and very very delicious food . The staff pegging from the chief to the in charge person , very very good people, I recommend their restaurant the curry culture - DABBAWALLA restaurant in Robertson Quay for a perfect dinner and lunch . Good luck for all and thank you staff for the perfect hospitality ❤

Food: AveragePrice: OverService: GoodLocation: GoodAtmosphere: PoorOverall verdict: Average, over priced.

I am an English lover of curries and enjoy them in many parts of the world. This brother of the Cuppage Terrace restaurant, The Curry Culture is every bit as good as it's sibling.I had Dabba Gosht and Paneer Makanwahla with a garlic nan. The lamb was beautifully cooked and I cut it all with my fork, the paneer was less robust than I am used to, but the sauce was delicious! The man was freshly cooked. I was very impressed with the food and service, and they have kept the "indian amuse bouche" too! Happily recommend
4
We went to Curry Culture based on advice from Trip Advisor and were not disappointed. The food was terrific, the curry (butter chicken) and onion Bahji being highlights. The staff were terrific with our two young children and the menu caters for them as well (not easy to cater for children with Indian cuisine). The only point to make is that the wine is very expensive (circa $85 a bottle) but that is Singapore for you. Will definitely go back!
3
The side dish we had ordered was very spicy without salt actually.. the starters we had ordered did not have spice or salt.. the papad they gave as a welcome dish was brown in color.. overall the exp was not good.. wud never go back agai
5
Had a wonderful meal and will definitely be back. My husband travels to India a lot for work and said that this is one of the best meals he has had. Very friendly staff and great service. We had the samosa entree, lamb chops and fish tikka with nann bread. The food and wine was very reasonably priced and good servings too. Loved it
4
Good indian food. The spice levels on the curries are adjust as per your requirements. Will definitely go back there agai
5
Come here all the time, the staff practically know us and our order. It's the freshest and most well presented dinner going! They provide great service except ONE thing and I hope they read this - when our drinks are finished ask if we want another one, because we always do! And we'll end up staying longer and spend more money.Great food!
5
Been there with family on a Saturday lunch time. Quite relaxed so the service really focused on us. I have to say one of the best TOP 10 services I had in singapore. Very helpful and supportive. I really felt like a guest. Waiter even offered to try something first before ordering in the light of expectation management. Food is delicious. Had the special mango chicken curry. Great, thick and creamy. My partner had chicken jalfreezi. Superb and tender meat. The whole menu is worth trying. They have many loyal customers who regularly recommend this place.
5
I have had a good number of Indian meals whilst living in Singapore, but The Curry Culture is out on it's own as the best I have had to date. Really great starters, perfectly spiced curry, excellent service and friendly staff. We will definitely be back, frequently
5
Our third visit to this restaurant on Robertson Quay.Warmly welcomed and attentive friendly service throughout.We enjoyed two main courses, Butter Chicken and Malabar Fish Curry, served with Saffron Rice and accompanied by two Kashmiri Naans. Top notch, nicely presented and delicious.We were also served complimentary popadums and a taster dessert.All washed down with a jug of Tiger beer. Cost S$114Great meal, yet again. Will return when next in Singapore.Recommende
5
I was actually heading to another Indian restaurant when I passed this one and decided to give it a go. As a business traveller on my own I often find restaurants are not keen to set for just one, but this one was and as a "people watcher" I could see the staff were having fun and interacting with the punters. I sat outside but it was covered with a high roof and was a pleasant atmosphere. Food was good and I'll probably return
5
Brilliant food... butter chicken is a must try.. service was very good and the staff were friendly...
4
Great curries at a reasonable price, location is ok. Reasonable menu that offers good choice. Service is good.
4
If you are looking for good indian food dont miss to dine at Curry Culture. Great service and quality food is just what you want when you are away from home.
5
I had a fabulous meal at the Curry Culture. I was surprised how good the tandoori (Chicken Tikka) was. It was moist and so flavorful. I had the Lamb Vindaloo at a level 7 which is more than hot enough. (Any hotter and you can't enjoy. If you don't love heat, try level 4 or 5)
4
We ate here on our one night in Singapore and have to say, we weren't disappointed. Being from the hotbed of curries that is the north of England, this was never going to be the cheapest Indian meal we'd ever have but the quality was excellent and we deliberately steered towards dishes we don't see at home which were absolutely delicious.Service was very friendly and the quality good
5
Went here based on the reviews and not disappointed. Probably the best Indian meal I have ever had. Tried the Goan fish curry as a main, the spices and flavours were really good, all mouth-watering dishes. Service was efficient and friendly. I would definitely recommend this restaurant. There are some negative comments about the prices but I found it reasonable and you get what you pay for
5
I love a good Indian curry and coming from the UK I've become used to some great restaurants. I'm usually disappointed with Indian restaurants when travelling internationally but The Curry Culture is on par with the best you can find in the UK.Mouthwatering food and good service
4
We went there just right before they closed. Ordered tikka masala and grilled platter which were enough for two (almost ordered one more dish but the host said it might be too much food haha). Tikka masala was thick and tasty. As what you would expect from authentic Indian restaurant. The tandoori chicken in the platter was amazing!!! Overall, 5/5 for taste3.5/5 for price ( 22 sgd for curry and 26 for platter are on the high side) 4.5/5 for ambience. There are lots of Indian places here in Singapore so I might try other places first before returning to curry culture.
5
This was our first visit to Singapore Having checked Tripadvisor we choose to eat at the Raffles Grill, The Colony and the Curry Culture.Whilst the first 2 were good and the service helpful, the Curry Culture was on a different superior levelHaving read the menu the 2 of us decided to share 3 starters and 3 main dishes out of the large choice (and that was just for Vegetarians).The gentleman who looked after us when choosing was kind enough to ensure we didn't order too much.They made the starters half portions as he felt a full portion of each would be too much.He was completely right.All the starters were great but the veg samosas were the best we have every had.Our 3 main courses, a lentil based one, a tomato based one and a potato one were exceptional.If we've had a better curry and we've had a lot; we can't remember itThe wine list whilst not long (that's a good thing) had a good selectionWe were too full for a dessert but we were brought a couple of spoonfuls of 3 to try.I'm not usually a fan of Indian desserts but these were very good and I might be forced to reconsider All the staff we met were great and you felt it was important to them that you enjoyed your visit and we didThe only disappointment was that we didn't go on our first night so we would have been able to visit again before leaving Singapore.Thanks for a great nigh
5
Went here for my husbands birthday. Very impressed by helpfulness and professionalism of staff.If I were to split hairs I'd say the drinks could've come out a little earlier at the start. But really, in the grand scheme of things it hardly mattered, we'll be returning. Food was great and they were happy to pack up what we couldn't eat so we could take it home
5
We wanted something different for our Friday after work meal. We decided on the location, Robertson quay. After walking around with different choices we ended up at the curry culture. We recognized the name from TripAdvisor. So we decided to give it a try. We didn't want to get too full as we planned to follow our meal with more drinks later. We ordered tandoori platter and level 6 lamb vindaloo. We love spicy. Originally I wanted to order our vindaloo at level 8 but we were warned by the waiter not to as level 5 is considered spicy. So we downgraded to 6. :) we also got two glasses of house red wine. The meal was great the curry was spicy and the meat was nice and tender. I could have gone to at least 7. The tandoori platter was a good serving portion. All and all was a good dining experience. This might be another one of our after work meal routine. Good food good setting and good service. :
5
Had a wonderful dinner last night here with my Mrs. and a good friend. Complimentary bites & popadums to begin with, before a selection of very tasty curries. We shared sheek kebabs, a spiced murgh tikka masala, and a minced lamb and green pea curry.All were wonderful and accompanied by a bottle of malbec from their extensive wine list. Rice, naans and other sundries all to a decent standard.Expensive - as per Singapore - but for a formal northern Indian curry experience in a restaurant with great service and good ambience, this place is recommended. Meal for three with drinks and service around $120 SD
5
I was brought here by my boyfriend as he lives nearby which has already became his weekday go-to place for dinner.Curry is really good, probably among some of the best I have had. Lots of choices on the menu. Have to say that the staff is very friendly with attentive service. Price is very fair as well considering it's in Robertson Quay.I will highly recommend people who goes to Clark Quay can take a bit of walk to Robertson Quay for less touristy atmosphere but more vibrant restaurant scene and of course this restaurant in particular. I will definitely come back next time visiting Singapor
5
Delicious food in a friendly atmosphere. One of the party was heard to mutter that it was the best Indian food they'd ever tasted. The only complaint is that the restaurant isn't in Northeast England
5
In Singapore on holiday for 8 nights how lucky were we to find this restaurant The staff were so attentive the whole evening happy and polite the manager fussed and joked with us the food was out of this world and we want everyone to go there. It's location May get missed tucked away between other restaurants on Robertson quay but look it out we will ourselves be back tonight for second time Price was fair for the quality food thankyou to staff for being part of our holiday experience lynda & alan u
2
Did not stand up to reviews. Except for the area where it is located..nothing else appealed to me. the quality and the service standard exhibited were quite bad. Plenty of restaurants on race course road as well as cbd do way better in terms of food quality and much less expensive. Paneer Tikka was not even fully cooked...the spices were not properly done in the main courses as well...lachcha paratha was like papad...would never visit the place agai
5
I frequently get dinner at this resurgent and have always had a great delicious meal. Always eat too much as the flavours are great. They will even suggest some different dishes if you wish to try something new. Great service with friendly staff. I will be back
4
Smiling staff, great food and calm surroundings. Found it by chance, but have been coming back again and again
5
The food was amazing along with great service. Thanks for a very enjoyable evening for my friends and I
5
Enjoyed the food at curry culture. It was a quiet night and the staff were attentive. The prices were on the high side, but that's probably more due to the location. The place doesn't really have ambiance but there's nothing wrong with it either.We had a fish curry and a vegetarian dish. Would happily go back and have both again.
5
Seriously good Indian food. Very highly recommended. Very friendly staff too. Right by the river and a lovely atmosphere
4
Food was very good and service was attentive and friendly. Good choice for someone who is gluten free with all curries gluten free.
5
I was in Singapore for a business trip and wanted to try this place out. I ordered two items from the specials menu - a fish tandoori starter and a chicken curry main, along with pilau rice, garlic naan and a Kingfisher.The food was superb - the best Indian curry I have had in Asia. I'd had a really good curry in Hong Kong in November, but this place blew it out of the water.The fish was succulent and juicy, with just the right amount of spice. The main was superb, and the naan bread was crispy on the bottom with a brushing of butter to make it the best naan I've ever had.I'd definitely go back. But probably not on a family holiday as it was rather heavy on the wallet. Higher end of mid-range
5
Been here a few times - and have never been disappointed. The staff are very good - polite, professional and friendly. Food is delicious - love the samosas, lamb korma, Paneer Tikka, prawn vindaloo (it's very hot!!), and Dahi Baingan. And of course the naan is good as well! Wash it all down with a cold Tiger beer
5
My husband and I and two friends went to Curry Culture at Robertson Quay for my husband's 60th birthday when we were on holiday. The staff were fantastic especially Jimmy who was very helpful when we were choosing our food. The food was really delicious and after the meal the staff came out with a cake with candles on it and sang happy birthday to my husband. Made him feel very special. We will certainly be back
4
We had dinner here as an alternative to the Orchard St restaurant (closer). Our head waiter was very friendly and helpful with our ordering. We were given complimentary papadums, a savoury bite each and sweet grains to chew after the meal! The Kingfishers were cold and the dishes were beautiful
5
Ended up here after leaving a nearby restaurant because of its terrible service...what a stroke of luck! The staff was helpful and enthusiastic and the food was marvelous. I plan on heading back a couple more times before I leave town
5
Lovely indian restaurant at Robertson Quay. Loads of choices, prices reasonable and do ask for the specials and the recommendations of the staff. Unfortunately they do not serve Indian wine, that would be a nice add-on. Staff is very friendl
5
This was the best meal we had of the trip. Friendly staff. The restaurant is a bit tucked out of the way. Beautiful food
5
We usually go to the outlet at Cuppage Terrace, so when we found the Robertson Quay outlet, we were so happy. Amazing service and dining, we love the cuisine and the specials keep us coming back to try something new. Perfect location at Robertson Quay - we even got lucky during the holidays and had a prime table for the Christmas carolers. The kids' menu automatically includes a side of broccoli and veg (thank you!). We love the food, and the atmosphere can't be beat. Staff are always very friendly and attentive. We can gush on about Curry Culture for ages
5
Staff are so welcoming and make your dining experience memorable Food is very nice and can be made to your preference Given some free samples of food from Mumbai to try and also free drink as it was our first visit to restaurant. Definately will be back and recommend to other
5
Good food to indulge in..
Great service from staffs..
Superb ambience tooo.. Had a great time & will definitely be back !! Kuddos to the curry culture team :)
5
Found this restaurant on TripAdvisor. I have enjoyed Indian food since the 1980's and this was as good as I have had. Service was amazing, food was the best we have had since arriving in Singapore, a week ago. Menu was superb, plenty of choice, including vegetarian options. The chicken tikka was excellent, proper breast, not the lesser cuts as often happens in some restaurants. I had tandoori prawns stuffed with crab, which was an excellent combination, that worked really well. The rice was as good as we have tasted, as were our three nan breads, all food was cooked to perfection.5 out of 5. Faultless.
5
We stopped here for dinner with the kids. Incredible food and service with good portion sizes. Just the right spice level for the kids and really tasty curries. Will definitely come back here
5
The taste sensations started when a complimentary appetiser arrived unexpectedly. It was Indian street food, but I can't remember the name. It was delicious - sweet and salty and crunchy all at the same time. We had vegetable samosas, lamb korma (my husband loved the menu description that it was softer than a baby's bum - and it was!), Navrattan korma, saffron rice and naan. We loved all of our food. I had a fresh lime soda, which was sweet and salty and very refreshing. Our bill was around $100.Curry Culture is at Robertson Quay, which is a residential area and is quieter than nearby Clarke Quay. We arrived before 6 and there were a handful of customers there. The service was attentive without being intrusive. I hope we can visit again before our holiday ends
5
Found this place by chance tucked away off the quayside. When the tiny popadoms and dips turned up I was a bit concerned as they were quite bland, I should say I'm from England and our dips/pickles are somewhat more tasty. Anyway next came a little taster, an amuse bouche I suppose, which was really fresh, clean and tasty. I ordered the macchi amritsari which was delicious (like a slightly spicy fish pakora) and the Mughal tikka masala also delicious washed down with a few tigers. Had a great chat with the head guy there in between courses. Nice place, not expensive $96 would definitely go back.
5
What a fabulous meal both of us had , it was tastiest Indian meal everything was cooked fresh , well presented and with care and passion you like to see . Sadly we found this on our last evening or we would have eaten there more often.
5
We chose to go here based on the excellent reviews and were not disappointed. Every dish was delicious; really very good. The kids loved it too. Although it was not cheap, the price was in line with others in the Quays area of Singapore. They also made a good cocktail. Highly recommend.
4
The maitre d' at this restaurant was warm and welcoming. Whist 3 of us love good Indian food, my 10 yr old daughter cannot tolerate any spice so had never been to an Indian restaurant before. Happily, the restaurant has a Kid's menu, with food well suited to younger tastes, so she was happy to dine there.The maitre d' was excellent, recommending dishes from the main menu that gave my daughter a gentle and delicious introduction to Indian food. He also explained some of the food heritage. The kitchen and especially the Tandoor oven can be viewed through glass windows, so you can see the chefs preparing your food. We were all fascinated by watching the Tandoori chef cooking meats and breads.All dishes were delicious. My daughter particularly loved the Mango Chicken dish. All dishes were of a high quality and beautifully flavoured.The only reason that I can't give Curry Culture 5/5 is that the drinks service was unreliable and slow, it took a very long time for the drinks that we ordered to arrive, and we had to keep asking for more water, rather than it being brought around regularly.Overall, dining at Curry Culture was a great experience and we will very happily return
5
Another fabulous night at Curry Culture. It was our daughter's 6 birthday and it's her number one choice restaurant in Singapore. Staff and food were amazing. Big thank you to everyone.
5
We were up for a good Indian meal but as we were staying in Robertson Quay we opted to try this local restaurant rather than venture farther afield such as Little India.The haze was particularly bad that night so we ate in and the restaurant was had a very pleasant ambience; it was clean, tidy, uncluttered and inviting.Our waiter was exceptional an did not stop smiling. Clearly he enjoyed what he does and you couldn't help feeling good when you're being served, and served well, by a waiter with a smile like that. He explained clearly what everything on the menu was and particularly how hot the Vindaloo could be.The food was superb. Everything we had, and there were six of us so we tried quite a few dishes. Couldn't fault anything. Portion sizes were spot on, tastes were excellent and service was timely, efficient and extremely pleasant.Couldn't want more from a meal.Only criticism. The drinks were on the expensive side. Beers were upwards of $13 SD for a small bottle but we came to realise that anywhere along this tourist trap including Clarke, Robertson and Boat Quays, alcoholic drinks are expensive. It wasn't enough though to detract from a great meal
5
Another Curry Club and another exceptional restaurant in Singapore. The service was an exceptional high standard we never wanted for anything, the food was some of the best I have had in Singapore, great rich taste and something to suit everyone tastes. This is a little gem in Robertson Quay and definitely worth a visit if you are looking for good curry with very little fuss. A great variety and a good wine list to accompany your food and very well priced. We were a big group and there were no issues at all in a highly enjoyable evening. It does get quite busy later on so make sure you book to not miss out. Thank yo
5
We are from Germany and we had our first Indian experience in Singapore. The waiter was very lovely and explained all delicacies of the Indian cuisine. The food tasted fantastic and the cocktails were delicious. By the way, even the atmosphere and the establishment makes you feel comfortable. If you ever go to Singapore, you have to visit "The Curry Culture"
4
My husband and I have visited the (first) Curry Culture restaurant at Cuppage twice and we loved their food. So when we had family visiting us in Singapore, we decided to try their new outlet at Robertson Quay as we were in that area and we were not disappointed.Like their other outlet, the service was excellent. We ordered Jal Jeera (good!), paneer tikka, mixed vegetables, dal, dahi baingan, chole peshawari and butter naans. The dahi baingan was really nice and the butter naans are sooo, sooo soft and melt-in-the-mouth! The chole peshwari was average and nothing to shout about. Overall, a good meal
5
We were recommended to go here by our friends who are regulars. It was a fantastic experience and the food was the best Indian I have had in Singapore (I have been here for 3 years). Try the Amritsari MachliÂ (Fish) and the karahi lamb level 4 if you dare. The vegetarian food is also splendid, try the shahi paneer and Malai Kofta.

I have visited this restaurant only two times and both have been a culinary experience to remember the food is outstanding and the service excellent the staff make you feel more than welcome and like the most important person there. Please remember I am a guy on his own and only a two time customer.Singapore is a progressive city/country and the cost of living is not cheap but I will take the time to list the menus costs for the fantastic food, the most expensive dish on the menus is just S$35;00 the cheapest is S$8:00. There are snacks S$8 to 18,soup S$9,, chicken S$10 to 36, fish & seafood $20 to 22, lamb S20 to 24, vegetable dishes S$17 to 20, vegetable sides S$14 to 19 , rice S$6 to 22, breads S$4:50 to 8 , Indian salads S$5, deserts S$5 to 9 and the drinks list is beer S$10 to 14 , Indian cocktails S$13 to 14, other cocktails glass S$13 and jugs 45, wines are Singapore prices but spirits areS$11 to 14 with mo tails at S$5 to 9. And no I am not a partner, relative, or associate but I am feeling like a friend after my two experiences of this restaurant.The staff and management are good at what they do,they are welcoming and determined to please any patron ( I remind you I have only been there twice and my visits were at least 2 months apart because I visit only when I transit Singapore) well done management and staff.The cleanliness is as expected restaurant, and if I had any other comment to make it is a pity the restaurant site is not directly on the river front but a littl way back from the boardwalk I'd Robertsons Quay but you still have a glimpse of the river and passers bye. This is not a real downside though because it adds to the quiet ambience of the dining experience. Robertson Quay is just downriver of Clark Quay, an upmarket area with plenty of activity and a boast of other restaurants on site but in my opinion if you want to savour the taste of genuine classic Indian food take the trouble to give the CURRY CULTURE a try

We have been living in the Rob Quay area for some time and decided to try curry culture which is tucked away near the blow-up bridge. Attentive service and nice flavours made for a most pleasant meal with the family. The mango chicken was on special and something a little different from the norm which I'd recommend. While there is a lot of good Indian food in Singapore this is one of the better ones in proximity to the river. Will likely return

We shared a very tasty and enjoyable Indian meal with friends over the long weekend. It was pleasant outdoor seating and we enjoyed cold beers and wine with our dishes, which came piping hot, in traditional copper pots. Service was very good and we look forward to returning. Thanks to Staff @ CC! (We miss "Vintage India"

This restaurant has to be eaten in to be believed! Whilst on a girlies trip to Singapore with my Mum we stumbled across this amazing restaurant at Robertson Quay and ate here twice during our five day stay. Although it's not your typical British curry house it does have something on the menu for everyone. The staff were extremely knowledgeable, were happy to recommend dishes to suit our palate and were so very welcoming. We were able to see the chefs cooking our meal through a window to the kitchen and they came out to have their photo taken with us and the front of house staff, which was a lovely touch. The food was out of this world and so amazingly tasty. We wish we could have picked this restaurant up and brought it back with us to the UK. Thank you to all of the staff for a fantastic all round experience

I was here under sufferance. A trip with some work mates. Service was passable but the we had a variety of meals. All were poor. Curries either tasted of vinager or super sweet. Exceptionally expensive food in resteraunt with no atmosphere

We were recommended by friends and we did well to listen to them. Hard to find as it is tucked away in a corner of Robertson quay but well worth the visit.One of the best Indian meals that we have had. The quality of the meats just stand out and the flavours of the curries are quite bold. The staff is very friendly and help you choose as per your taste. We were served a lovely amuse bouche to begin with and it just went uphill from thereWorth a visit if you like quality Indian food, we will definitely retur
