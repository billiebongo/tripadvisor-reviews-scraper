Service is great and staff are very attentive. Western food is better than local food. With 30% corporate discount good value for money

We had 1 for 1 main offer for dinner which was a good deal. I like the chicken dish that goes perfectly with fruity sauce...give that umph! Enjoyed the quiet ambience after a busy day at work.

The food is not bad, good variety, good quality. However the service was very very slow... Must be willing to wait

Good decor
Some good food at affordable prices
A little let down by freeloaders - occupying tables chatting quite loudly - spoils the ambience for paying customers

Enjoyed a quiet lunch with more than decent food and quiet ambience. The service was fine and it is value for money .

A very pleasant place to just laze and lounge around in. Little touches like the old school sweet and biscuit are a nice nostalgic touch.

The eating place is small by what you can expect from the main lobby of a hotel. Nice atmosphere and was there for mom's birthday. The staff was very attentive to us, explaining the running promotions and offered to help with the celebration logistics. Thumbs up to the crew

If you are looking for somewhere in the east away from the crowd, this is a good choice. The menu has both western and local delights. Service is friendly. I will highly recommend the waffle with ice cream for dessert. Best waffle i had tasted for a while

I've been here twice and tried several dishes from both the local and western menu. Overall their food is pretty decent. The standout for us was the Roast Beef Fillet. Well cooked, juicy and tasty. There was a promotion with reservations made on Chope to get 1 for 1 mains. Even without the promotions, items on the menu were all affordably priced with most items under $20. Service was good when you get them. Both times i was there, there wasn't any staff presence to greet and bring us to our table until a minute or 2 later when someone appeared. Once seated, it was easy to get their attention
