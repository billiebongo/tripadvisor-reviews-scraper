The food and herbal tea I had, was very delicious, and the place itself and the owner making this restaurant very special. For me, it is one of the best places in the world to eat.

Had lunch at about 1pm and there were 4 dishes plus dessert on the menu. My hubby had the Brown rice set, which came with tasty vegetables including pumpkin, mushrooms, long beans, a green veg. I had the 'Bak Kut Teh' with mee sua (translates to pork bone tea with rice vermicelli) a vegetarian version of course. Delicious and bahkut teh herbs not too strong. Chewy 'pork' with soya puffs, carrot, corn. Dessert was Bubor Cha Cha made with sweet potato, yam, and the surprise ingredient banana. Enjoyable and not uncomfortably heavy like some versions of this dessert. Ginger tea completed the meal.Came for the food, the Buddhist vibe is charming, there are a lot of regulars

Absolute gem of a restaurant. Stepping to an oasis of cool and calm from the bustling heat of Chinatown, one is treated to delicious, healthy organic vegetarian food.The menu is updated regularly, and there is a variety of cuisines and styles so I managed to have a Western style mushroom soup and an Asian style brown rice with mixex vegetables in the same meal. We bought a lotus leaf wrapped rice and savoury pumpkin cakes to takeaway - those were really good!Best of all the price is unbeatable. For $7.50 you get a main course, sides and desserts are around the $3 mark.The place is run by a lovely couple who clearly put their hearts and souls into and take pride in their cooking. To eat here is not only to be fed, but to be truly nourished

I could not have asked for more on a hot sweltering day while navigating the melee of Smith Street. The dark cool interior was quirky and inviting -- also promised a cleansing vegetarian meal with local flair.The owner approved of my choice of the brown rice-based listing. He has an overtly brusque manner but engages in conversation easily. We ended up exchanging life stories and he told me about his family's journey from "traditional" Buddhism (as he described it) to Tibetan Buddhism and the founding of this restaurant. He gave me two books on Buddhism that I will cherish!The food was inexpensive and delicious -- the Sino-Singaporean vegetarian flair that I would not have got elsewhere. I enjoyed lunch and ginger tea for under $10

We came at 11.35 am and waiting for this "Ci Yan" open, when the owner arrived i ask him when this "Ci Yan" open. He replied curtly : twelve ! And close the door than lock it , and we wait in front of this "Ci Yan" until 12 pm. At 12.05 pm i came in ask the owner's staff he replied curtly too : yes we are open but you must wait ! .. then i answer : wait where ? , he said : Up To You ! Just come back at 12.30 pm. So we did not eat there

I like the vibe of the place; however I was a little disappointed by my visit. The cashier was friendly but the lady who brought out my food was a little dismissive - she just plunked the food down on the table and walked away. The food was only ok - I got a noodle soup, which looked like two minute noodles with some cooked frozen vegetables. The menu changes everyday so not sure if I came on a dud night
5
Right on the busy Smith Street, you can sneak away from the noise by entering Ci Yan. The menu changes everyday, and the food will most likely run out by around 9.30pm so go early!You enter an establishment decorated as if you've entered an old aunty's house. Religious figures, TV with soap opera, tons of books. The cutlery is in a box and you should get it yourself.The food was amazing, delicious, super cheap. And a sizeable amount. You can have a great couple's meal for under 20S
5
In a very convenient area a nice healthy vegetarian place to indulge in. Charming interior and helpful owners. Set menu changing every day and the food is delicious. Cane back couple time and will be back for more. Great to have a vegetarian options here. Owner said they dont use msg, extra additives, salt or pepper... and so far it only felt exactly like that
5
It was a miserable rainy evening when we sat down to dinner at Ci Tan.The man and woman duo who run this restaurant have been doing so for 20 years and you can see why. While the menu is small, all items are delicious, freshly cooked and purely organic and vegetarian. From my understanding, the menu changes everyday, but all meals are organic and vegetarian.It also made for a cheap outing, with main meals coming in at $6-7 dollars. With dessert, a meal for 2 people will cost around $20To sum up, this is a small, family run restaurant well worth visiting in a district which can be overwhelming and overpriced. Ci Yan is cheap, but definitely cheerful. The weather failed to dampen our spirits after eating here

the menu changes so it is displayed on a board. there were about six options. the guy was really pushing us to get certain items. they use organic ingredients and no garlic & onion. we ended up going for mushroom ho fun noodles which were nice. they don't have a massive selection of drinks, just some soft drinks and ice teas.
5
The food here is home cooking standard dishes. The owner focuses on quality and healthy dishes. Not many dishes to choose from but good food overall. Portions just right but for big guys may need to order more.
1
We were unlucky that we found and tried this place. Services were bad, owners were rude. Toilet is smelly.
5
Small and simple place, hearty and humble owners. The vibe is extraordinary and so is the daily menu. Visited twice during my one week stay in Sg.
It's a unique place, not upmarket by soulful kitchen and sumptuous food served with more than a smile.
5
Full marks goes to this place, they offer great tasting and healthy food. Limited menu, but the taste & health factor makes up for it. It is a small joint run by a family. Prices are in the range of SGD 5-7 per set meal.

The owner has a menu but directs everyone to his specials on the chalkboard. When asking he keeps pushing for No 1 on the board so I ordered that. My husband wanted something different but he insisted No 1 was best so we ordered it. Had to sit outside on the crickety table because we wanted to buy a beer. It was $7 for a few vegetables around a mound of rice. The mango dressing consisted of a few drops on a tiny bit of lettuce. Very disappointed we ate there

This restaurant used to be a pretty good deal. You always have limited option (2-3 choices), and the food is pre-prepared and comes out pretty fast, but tastes delicious. In the last few months the prices have gone up a lot proportionally. At the beginning of 2016, meal options ranged from $4-$5.5. Now the pricing is $5-$7.The owner also doesn't like people hanging out after a meal for too long, and basically kicks the customers out once they're done eating, so that's not very nice. (maybe she's stingy about the air con?

Found it this evening for our dinner, inside the busy Chinatown food court area. Small little restaurant. very few choices. Not many guests but 2 of; 2 before were just left, 1 came after we finished. Not sure if we would come back. Not as friendly people serving us, although expecting the inner peaceful people as the room was full with Budha related ornaments. Food was average, seemed pre-cooked earlier. Good thing was very quick food served

We were looking for a vegetarian/vegan restaurant in Singapore and this came up as one of the top rated. We ordered 3 dishes and they were all quite disappointing (one was pretty disgusting). The owner of the place was very nice and the atmosphere there was quite authentic.
5
I followed the recommendations in tripadvisor and ate at this nice place in Chinatown, Singapore. Run by father and son, the father greets the clients and takes the orders and the son is the "chef". All clients that are there for the first time are recommended the brown rice set menu and it is very nice! Highly recommended
5
Probably this place is the weirdest restaurant I have ever been to, in the good sense. The vibe is really awesome, you feel like you are invited by a family for a good food. While you are eating you can enjoy watching some Asian soap operas together with the owners and their and family members or friends. Regarding the food, I really liked they didn't use tons of oil and that I didn't have to worry about having a piece of chicken hidden in between tofu cubes (it happened to me in a salad bar!). The brown rice set is definitely something to try if you visit the restaurant. I had it every time I went there and every time it was slightly different :) It wasn't not enough though so usually I ended up ordering another dish and the dessert
4
I never knew Chinese has pure veg cuisine before arriving this restaurant. It was a fantastic experience that I had lunch over here in this restro I would recommend all vegans n vegetarian must try this once you are in Singapore..
5
I visted this place with my sister - she has a gluten free diet and I am vegetarian so it was good to find somewhere that catered easily for us both. Really mouthwatering food. I would recommend it to anyone who loves real food.
3
As most of, the vegetarian food I come across is rather oily, I tried the brown rice set with few veg dishes on the plate @ S$6.50 with no drinks. The food is not oily and taste not too bland. Simple set up inside this restuarant. Nothing much to comment

The co-owner created an account and deleted it after writing this message. This is the only way for me to get back to him. May all readers find this useful.My reply.Hello dear co-owner,I understand it is very hard for you to take a bad review amidst all the more positive ones. The fact that you remembered this incident must have been that the rudeness from your dad is a little out of the norm. When someone is irritable, the doors tend to be shut a little louder than usual. I understand that. And as for me visiting only once before, it is a false assumption, being that I have visited 3 times prior to this incident, with different people on each occasion. I admit the previous visits were very positive, or I would not have brought my family here. It was positive enough for me to want to clear my own dishes, so I was really disappointed that this incident made my mom upset, at the attitude we were given. I did not realize your dad had a hearing problem, so that was my mistake there. I will revise the review. However, I do not believe that you should label my review as less than half true. I had really wanted to be a regular here, as I do appreciate a good organic vegetarian meal, having visited 3 times in two weeks prior to this incident. I appreciate your family creating this place, but I feel upset that we were treated poorly by your dad. Maybe, in future, you can try to make guests more welcome by mitigating the bad attitude from your dad. I believe you are a filial son who are helping out in the shop, and are writing this to me as you wish the best for your family's business. I shall weigh in the good experience along with the bad, add on the points you have stated and update my review. have a pleasant day and all the best for your family's business :)On Jun 20, 2015, at 01:09 PM ciyan810 wrote:Im the co-owner of ciyan, and I witness firsthand what was happening.

However, I was incredibly disappointed when they gave me a terrible attitude when I said I didn't want the wrap since they said they ran out of charsiew. I was not keen on the wrap and thus cancelled that order. The owners are immature and throw tempers when things don't go their way. The owners started slamming the kitchen door non-stop, and as the only customers in the store, me and my family felt very unwelcome. The guy collected the money very rudely, and when we were leaving, the lady rudely asked if we have paid

Hi I would like share about my experience at this restaurant. Its amazing I was shocked when u saw pure vegetarian Chinese food. Actually I am food lover but I am vegetarian so I found this restaurant brown rice set is mind blowing with some sweet pineapple. And one of uncel recommended me soup he told me this soup is for energy. And over all i love this food and restaurant
4
It is such a pleasant change to find a totally vegetarian cafe where I'm not paranoid about the food being cooked in animal fat or with fish. I have visited this place three times and have being pleased with each meal I have eaten. The brown rice set meal is unassuming and healthy, not spicey but has enough flavour's. I also recently had a rice noodle dish with chilli which even my meat eating hubby enjoyed. I ordered takeaway because the rest of my family eat meat and wanted to eat out in the food street. This is a good choice if you want the market atmosphere, otherwise you can eat inside where it is quiet

I visited about 430PM on Dec 18, 2014. 3rd time visitingFood : I ordered Brown rice set and a soup - reasonably good quality and healthy tasting with no overwhelming seasoning. Food was served promptlyPrice : Reasonable considering its organic and its located in ChinatownAmbience : quite corner from the noise of Chinatown - however throughout my 15 mins meal in the restaurant, the family was very very loud in discussing the problem of a particular staff. I am not sure if that is just a style of conversation but discussing how unhappy they are with a staff in front of customers is unwarranted.Generally a good place for simple vegetarian meal albeit the fact that the loud discussion was very disturbing even I was sitting in in the midst of many Deities in the restaurant
5
We walking Down china town and saw this place, we were very welcome by the gentelman and the lady, she is the head chef I guess, she explained the concept to us and cooked some amazing food, in fact this was the one of the best vegetarian restaurants we have been without doubts, their food is just Very very good really amazing that's all I can say I will go back there for sure and bring friends also, great job thank you for your food and services

I had had a bit of a rubbish night searching for hours for a festival that didn't exist and was starving making my way back through Chinatown. This is when I first stumbled across Ci Yan. They were actually already closed, but the owner's father could see that I was hungry so he invited me in and sold me their last meal for the day to takeaway! It was delicious and I felt so treasured that I returned the next day and had the laksa for my dinner. The Mid-Autumn festival was also on so they were selling a variety of moon cakes - the only egg-free ones you can find - the glaze does have milk in it (I'm vegan), but they cut the top off for me so that I could still eat one. They're also happy to leave the glaze off entirely but need to know a day in advance.The restaurant uses no eggs and most things are vegan, but as they do use milk be sure to check with the owner/chef that food is suitable for vegans before making your selection.Very good prices here also (SG$6-$7 a meal) - I couldn't find any vegan food with the hawkers, and the other vegetarian restaurant near Buddha Tooth Relic Temple is quite expensive apparently.A great option of the budget-conscious veg traveller. I will return

I had the reviews about this 'Pure-Vegetarian' healthy food restaurant on TripAdvisor and wanted to give it a try. On the visit to Chinatown, we were quite hungry and needed to 'recharge' our energies. After our visit to Buddha Tooth Relic Temple, we visited this foodie joint in a lane. We ordered for Brown Rice Set Meal.($6) and it was served in 3-4 minutes. It was nice, tasty and we enjoyed. It may look a little bland to some people, but none the less a good eat. Address:Ci Yan Organic Vegetarian Health Food, 慈缘轩健康素食, 8 Smith Street, Chinatown Ph 62259026 Mon to Sun: 12noon - 11pm (although not reliable). Besides Buddha Tooth Relic Temple

Not too crowded, though nestled in the midst of Chinatown.Limited menu. Organic, Vegetarian. Food was freshly prepared.Had a brown rice set meal along with a desert. Over all nice experience.Good staff.
4
We, family of 5, enjoyed this place! Dined inside and it felt like being in their home. Very kind staff. Self service for drinks and cutlery.
4
I went alone and the place didn't disappoint. Had the pasta salad. And I must admit the raisins mixed in the salad actually gave the dish the kick it needed. Nice combination of baby carrots, tomatoes, potatoes, raisins, and baby bean sprouts. Thumbs up!
3
Went here on recommendation of Lonely Planet guide; had the brown rice set meal which was tasty and at less than 10 Singapore Dollars contrasted wildly with the $80 minimum charge for KU DE TA the following evening ! We were about the only diners on a Sunday evening so the restaurant lacked atmosphere; for that it would have been better to sit outside and eat from the street stalls
5
We came by chance in front of this tiny restaurant after a terrible flight to Singapore...We really needed some healthy and light food to digest - the polite owner gave his suggestions on the menu and offered us his fresh tea - which was delicious.Honestly, very simple ingredients yet combined in a great way made our dinner unforgettable
5
Found this by chance whilst visiting Chinatown. Authentic simple healthy homely food and the owner is quite a character. Limited menu choice, but then this is a small place. The owner recommends a dish based on his assessment of you - and he got it right with us! Food was delicious.

This restaurant has a blackboard menu that changes daily. Sunday lunchtime provided limited options - we orded the "Brown Rice Set Meal" and "Handmade Noodles". Seating is on small stools at low tables and the dÃ©cor is Buddhist inspired.The rice dish came with small portions of vegetables, lettuce topped with a tart mango sauce and tofu in gravy. Plenty of noodles were found in a large bowl along with carrot, cucumber and tofu in gravy. The gravy was not especially nice, tasting like it had come from a can. More vegetables would have been appreciated in both dishes. It was nice to have wholesome brown rice for a change.The service was satisfactory and being a quiet day the dishes were served reasonably quickly. Overall moderately priced uninspiring food
5
Within this small vegetarian treasure, you feel like in China Town how it was before and should be. There are many buddhas looking to you and the good thing the air condition is not set in a way that you are freezing. If you like to be in a casual, family type place and want to be sure, that no animal products are used, this is the right address. I especially liked the sweet potato desert which is prepared with a lot of ginger. Excellent are also the self made samosa.Just feel and try this place
4
the food was amazing and this is why we stayed there. We got yelled at because we didn't choose what we wanted to eat right away. The owner is just not the nicest. However, we would go back because everything was delicious and try to breathe in and out so we don't get disappointed at his treatment. YES, food was this good
5
I'm not vegetarian and not inclined to become one, but Ci Yan offers some of the best veg meals I have ever had.Good: Food is home-cooked, only organic, healthy, scrumptious and high quality; good portions; homely interior; lovely family that manages the place; convenient location - on Smith Street in ChinatownBad: Nothin
5
There is no printed menu, and you only get to select from the list of today's special on a blackboard. But I was very delighted with what I was offered, both healthy and delicious! Nothing too fancy, but simply great vegetarian food!
4
This is a lovely casual restaurant that offers very clean and comfortable dining.
There are a selection of meals on the dinner board and both the dishes we chose were delicious. The meals are reasonably priced and the service was very friendly.
5
Ci Yan is a small place with amazing food! A perfect option at night when the restaurant at the temple is closed. They make different dishes every day and everything tastes very good! Try it if you like vegetarian food, and if you don't, try it anyway... you'll like it! ;-

The decor is unassuming but very inrterestng with many Tibetan Buddhist images. The food was quite tasty. I ordered pumpkin soup and it was delicious (and I usually don't like soups). The main plate consisted of brown rice, and 3 sauteed vegetables (mixed bamboo shoots, eggplant, and kale) with a bit of lettuce and diced carrots topped by a small amount if tasty mango dressing. I also recommend the ice herbal tea - delish! The restaurant was peaceful and quiet with some quiet music in the background. Quite a nice change from the busy city.  A good deal price-wise relative to other places in over-priced Singapore (tho SE Asia local fare can be so cheap any place in Singapore is a bit dear).Def be back again
5
We tried 4 dishes here and 2 were simple wonderful. The minestrone soup was impeccable. Tofu with satay like sauce was beautiful. Such fresh tofu- yum! The millet paella was something I.enjoyed but my wife found it not quite flavoursome enough. Mushroom noodles was the only weaker dish so I would suggest to opt for one of the other dishes. Staff are very pleasant. Will be back
5
Awesome place to eat and cheap! I had Chinese pancake wrap and the winter melon honey date dessert. It might not look like much on the inside but the staff are awesome and the food amazing for the price! Ps. I'm NOT vegetarian but would definitely go back for more :

I was introduced by a local Singaporean friend to this restaurant. It is really a no-frill vegetarian restaurant. It's strength is neither it's ambience or it's food presentation. But once you have a taste of it, it really gives the novice vegetarian a different impression of what potential spectrum vegetarian food has to offer. Very flavorful food, but a very limited menu, but from what I understand they have daily offerings everyday. Look for Madame Wong the proprietor of this shop. It is really very different from the mass market vegetarian restaurants in Singapore, let in Asia. She uses very good quality ingredients in her products
3
This is a make shift restaurant. Do not expect anything more in terms of comfort. The food was good but really nothing special. I'd make the same food at home if I was not trying very hard. The ingredients are all organic and priced at 5-6$ a dish, its worth it.If you are happy for a no frills restaurant with a 4 dish organic menu for $5-6 then this is the place for you. Personally I felt there was room for a little effort to make this a restaurant.
4
We'd just got off a flight from London, found our hostel (Wink) around the corner, and were tired and hungry. So were delighted to find this little place near the end of Smith Street. There's a chalk board menu inside, only a few dishes but take a look at what others are eating to see which you fancy. We had one of each of the main courses, one was a curry with rice, the other a noodle dish. Both great, fresh, and just what we wanted - great value. I think it was about Â£10 in total. Really local atmosphere too.. i think the owner's wife was podding beans behind us for the following days menu
5
The food here was amazing! And so cheap! Everything organic. The menu is small, but everything is made fresh everyday. The man who owns the place is so nice and says hello to all the customers. It is easy to find - just off South Bridge Road in Chinatown on Smith Street. This place is a must for eating in Singapore
