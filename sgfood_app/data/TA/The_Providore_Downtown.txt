The service and food were good, with nice wine selection available as well. Well done for its relaxing atmosphere with some green walls, nicely spaced table, good ambient noise level (not too noisy), and good layout plan of the restaurant itself.

This was at downtown and not a lot of people over the weekend, it's great if you like to enjoy a quiet meal with the family. Service was great and food was decent.

Coffee is grounded in boutique facility in Melbourne Australia. It is really good. We had it with ice cream which was also great. Atmosphere is modern design and frequent with young people.

Food is nice and tasty. Iced tea tasted different from normal but still tastes "healthy". Overall, love the greenery and ambience.

Relaxing setting for weekends get together though the steps and far distance from lifts are not elderly friendly

Best breakfast we have had in Singapore - and by a long way. Smashes the hotel breakfasts. The food was great and coffee really good. Reminds me of cafes in Sydney.

Occupying the entire basement of Downtown Gallery, Providore provides a great dining experience with a mixed concept of retail and dining. Food quality was above average and service was prompt. Do take note that there is no lunch deals offered and hence, the price for the main course is on a high side for a typical weekday work lunch. Other than that, the place is still an uncovered gem and still offer a cosy atmosphere for a quiet meal

The outlet marks a new trend for cafes in Singapore. It comes with a detailed array of produces, products, wine, coffees, teas, cookbooks and kitchen utensils that will satisfy your gourmet instinct to the max !! For culinary or gourmet foodie, this is a must come place to explore how to get around international food with a twist of Singapore tricks. Youâ€™d have some extra information about food in Singapore generally

My younger daughter, all of 9, picked this spot for brunch. I didn't even know it existed till I learnt that it is fairly new. It's at OUE@Downtown and I have to say, it's quite an offering - from food to specialty food to cook books and a eye-catching selection of booze. It is a huge space though and I hope they succeed. I'm not really a fan of franchise-chains but I do feel Providore and maybe Cedele hold their own with a certain reliable, familiar taste. The kiddos had ricotta pancakes, ham and cheese while old folks had spanish eggs and salmon bagel. All pretty decent even if nothing super duper to write home about (unless you're writing here). Like I said earlier, it's more a reliable, familiar taste. This is one place where I'll come back just coz of the place more than the food. And to pick up one or two of them fancy booze bottles.
