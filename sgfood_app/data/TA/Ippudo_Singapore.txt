Ippudo Ramen is always good but every time I go I see that they have more variations which is kind of pointless.
3
The ramen may have been the best in singapore but IMO it tasted just alright, nothing special about it but if you donâ€™t know what to eat, it was a place to go to
5
We started with fresh salmon sushi, spicy chicken wings and then the karaka - men. A delicious mix of noodles, ham, spices etc. Superb Japanese food along with good service. One of the best meals so far this year.
5
Nothing beats a nice warm bowl of ramen during a rainy day. We also had the pork ribs (it was a large portion) and sake, really hit the spot!
3
If you like your ramen with thick broth, this is the place you can try. Price is on the high side compared to other ramen,
5
To paraphrase Casablance - of all the ramen joints in all of singapore, this is the one place to walk into.The place is almost always busy, and they dont take reservations, so the waiting time can vary from 10-40 mins, but I have found the wait well worth for me.I have been going here for the last 6 years, and though they have modified their flavors a bit over time, it still remains my favorite ramen joint. My staple is the Akamura Tamago, garlic oil based tonkatsu broth with egg, though if you are into miso, or the spicy type, they are worth while as well. fi you are really hungry, you can upgarde the bowl with :specials" - they coem with extra bamboo shoots, eggs and a fat slice of pork belly.The place can get very noisy though, so this is more a casual fare than a formal dinning.Revisit : Alway

Was at Ippudo Star Vista branch for dinner.This the third branch I tried. Personally feel that their Mandarin branch serves the best even though it's all the same Ippudo. Got counter seats to watch them prepare and cook. The miso broth comes from one same huge pot, condiments are added according to the type of noodles ordered.I like the fact that we get to choose our texture of noodles, soft-medium-hard-extra hard. You can add on a plate of noodles for an enticing $1. No offence but somehow today, everything's is tasting kinda mehmeh for me.The pork bun at $4 was overpriced but not as ridiculously overpriced compared to their matcha tiramisu at $6. It was served almost straight from the refrigerator and was comparable to the size of a baby's fist. Nothing like the square sized tiramisu pics posted at the other branches. Omg... seriously?! What a rip off! I mean... We haven't even added the 7% GST and 10% tax to the dishes...#overrated #matchatiramisu #ippudosingapore #mehmehfoo

We went to Ippudo at MBS. The Karaka-men was soo tasty. We ordered all the 4 levels of spicines (original, hot, very hot, and extra hot). There isn't too much different between original and hot. The spiciness begins at level very hot, I think. Would come here again for sure
4
Modern, sleekly decorated ramen bar at the top floor of Mandarin Gallery, right beside the escalator. The all-important broth is richly flavoured, without being too strong or salty, and servers would also ask you how youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d like your noodles done. Service is, overall, very fast and polite too
5
I always love a good bowl of ramen whenever it's raining. My favourite outlet is the one at Westgate as it is quiet and less busy during the weekdays. I really like it when they allow customers to choose the texture of the noodles. That's what they always do in Japan. Yummy noodles with excellent broth. Highly recommended to everyone
4
Very tasty ramen and good ambience. The price was reasonable. Broth very good. Located at prime area orchard road and very convenient. Service a little slow.
4
Itâ€™s been ages since the last time I ate at Ippudo (I used to eat at Ippudo Sydney). What I remember was Ippudo is really tasty however I felt the taste in Singapore was pretty different, not as good as Sydney.
5
We went to this 3 times while we were in Singapore the food is simple but very tasty highly recommended if you like Japanese food
4
This is my 2nd visit to this place. The food quality and service from the lads just seemed to get better. Very attentive and pleasant experience. Will be back ðŸ˜Š
4
Again cannot complain about restaurant and food.
Service is good .. food is well prepared tasty and good value.
One small issue the staff are so busy shouting Japanese welcomes it is somewhat noisy.
Well worth a visit

During my short getaway in Singapore, me and my family stayed at Mandarin Orchard and we got this recommendation from family friend to check out Ippudo Ramen which is located in Mandarin Gallery, a shopping mall just next to the hotel. It was a lunch time around 12.30 and omg the queue was pretty long already( so i was expecting something really good). We got seated after waiting in line for about 20 minutes and ordered the gyoza and ramen in black bowl and red bowl( i forgot the name). And omg.. the red bowl ramen, hands down to the tastiest broth Ive ever had!! It tasted just amazing and the sliced pork belly melted in my mouth. Definitely would recommend friends and family to try
3
Was here for lunch. My fourth visit and find that service standards have dropped. We were seated quickly but noone came to take our orders for a long time. We waved and called to catch the attention of waiters and it still took a while for them to notice. It is quite clear they are short handed and trying to avoid eye contact. When food was finally served, condiments such as garlic n sesame was not given. We had to wave and wait again. When it came to payment, I simply gave up and brought the bill to the counter. Quite disappointed as the waiters and servers used to be very attentive

I was really excited to visit the Ippudo store in Singapore as I had been to the ones in Japan. Sadly, I would have to say that it did not live up to it's expectations. For sure visit the stores in Japan - those are great. Getting back to the Marina Bay Sands store, it's fairly quiet at times. The service is okay, they had to ask me a few times to check about whether or not I could eat the meat, etc. You should ask/inform when taking the order. Not after. For the price, it,s not the cheapest ramen in Singapore. There are other restaurants who do a much better job. You don't get a lot for S$ 20 or even 30. I wish the food been better. For now, I will continue to remember my previous experience over this one
1
If you travel widely enough and have also eaten at Japanese Ippudo , then you might just get a shock at how far below the quality, taste and authenticity of the ramen and side dishes are at Ippudo Marina Bay Sands. They try to create a only available in Singapore ' ramen and side dishes that simply failed big time. Will never visit this outlet again. The Ippudo at Mandarin Gallery is much more decent and that is an outlet I will visit
3
Perhaps I was there much earlier at about 5pm plus....Service- only about 5 tables occupied but they still gave the table in between 2 other tables of 2. Appears that the remaining portion of the entire restaurant cannot be used. Thankfully for the sofa seat where my haversack can be placed.The wait staff were friendly, esp a girl alesha (not sure whether the spelling is accurate) whom could inform us on the difference of choices of ramen. They also had our water refilled regularly.Food- I am not sure why my aka chashu was a tad spicy cos I didnt ask for spicy and the menu didnt say that it was going to be spicy. weird. Furthermore, the other order, the aburi salmon don, was rather ordinary,as it wasnt smoked sufficiently. thats why the 3 stars.Value - It was quite decent for an orchard road eatery though the price is slightly higher than a normal ramen place
4
Fast and friendly service eventhough it was Saturday evening and the place was packed.
Had the best Ramen and Gyoza I have had in a long time.
We had their homemade lemonaide which is worth a second try.
5
We patiently waited for the long queue just to have a taste of their famous ramen.. We did not regret it. THe big bowl is soooo worth the wait! Tastes like we have travelled in Japan!
4
the soup is very thick ... the noodle is springy... plus tender meat... perfect....highly recommend for ramen lover
5
This place is about ramen and they are artistically composed. The broth is well balanced and rich, the noodles feel freshly made and all ingredients are of quality. The atmosphere feels young and is full of noisy efficiency. You will enjoy it.
5
Best ramen I have tried ever (out of japan). Love the akamaru special. You are allowed to order extra noodles (kaedama) for a tiny fraction of the price. Their matcha tiramisu is to die for
4
You want to have each ramen languorously , sucking each long ramen and getting a slow taste of the wonderful broth. Ideal for relaxed and casual meal rather than a business one. Epicurean pilgrimage....
4
Basically Ippudo is a great shop. I started frequenting their chain in Tokyo 10 years ago and will never forget it, In Singapore the experience is close to the same as in Tokyo - well done.
3
I was at the Mohammad Sultan branch for a quick work lunch. They have a grand total of 1 veggie option - the Soba Noodle Bowl. It was steaming hot and filling with a token sprinkling of some vegetables (two pieces of pepper, arugula, and mushrooms). Considering how good Japanese food is, a couple more options to cater to veggie lovers wouldn't be a bad idea
4
No regrets to visit this restaurant. Different types of ramen are available, and you can choose the level of spiciness and ramen hardness. If you like chewy, chose the hard ramen. I ordered the spicy black sauce ramen, so yummy! It's pricy if you order the special ramen. Tested the dumplings and green tiramisu, just average. So just focus on ramen will do
4
It might sounds tacky by the review description but of all ramen Singapore this is one of the best ramen you can have even it came with a crazy price tag for just a bowl (20$ and above). You can have your noodle in 4 level of hardness and some ramen with 4 level of spicy (i suggest stick with original level because it balanced with the taste of the broth). As for me the i recommend to chose the spicy ramen variety if you cannot handle the heat just have the original and it still very tasty
4
Among the top ramen places to be had in Singapore. Tasty, fresh, with a fine balance in taste of broth and ingredients.
Service was attentive and enthusiastic.
Worth visiting if you're looking for some tasty ramen.
5
The char siew rice tasted so good and its so cheap $5 only. The new menu was also very tasty. Overall experience was amazing!
4
Service is great. Ramen is delicious, the broth not too rich & flavorful. The pork melt in the mouth. We spend ~$60 for 2 ramen + 2 teas.
4
Really enjoyed the ramen. The restaurant looks really nice and the service is mostly friendly. Definitely worth a visit.
5
I have tried several Ramen restaurants and some even in Japan but Ippudo Ramen is one of the best I've ever tasted and I recommend this especially if you're outside Japan. The Karaka men tonkotsu broth is really divine, oishi and thick - please do have a generous sip of the soup before mixing all the ingredients. You have the option to select the spice, salt, and preparation of the noodles as well as additional ingredients. Every ingredients is of best quality - fresh pork, tonkotsu broth, vegetables, spices and noodles. The price is in the mid range but your money and effort of getting here(MBS is where I went) are worth all the efforts. Free water is also served. Truly this is the best Ramen restaurant outside Japan
4
First time at Ippudo! Visited the location at Mandarin Gallery, which has an excellent atmosphere. We ordered Gyoza, Chicken Katsu Bun, Goma Q, and Vegetarian Noodles. All of the dishes were exceptional. Our absolute favorite was the Chicken Katsu Bun, which was prepared perfectly and very delicious. All ingredients seemed fresh and very high quality. We will absolutely return. All ramen dishes come with pork, which is the favorite of most customers but adding chicken or tofu would be great. The only negative experience was the lack of knowledge of some menu items by the waitress. Total bill was $60 for two
4
Craving for ramen and decided to come here as our experience with Ippudo in Osaka was very good. Heard of the long queue so we went at 11:30am. Surprising no queue, but the place quickly fills up while we are there. Ordered the Shiromaru, Akamaru and the Karaka Special, topping up with the renkin chips and spicy chicken wings (highly recommended). Overall food was good, but we felt the outlet in Osaka was even better. Craving satisfied though
3
Famous for its ramen.Have not been here for a Long time.No queue at 12.30 p.m. on a Saturday but it was full by about 1 p.m. Shiromaru SpecialIPPUDO's original creamy tonkotsu broth served with thin and straight noodles, pork belly & pork loin, bean sprout, black fungus and spring onion. A classic Hakata-style ramen.Selection of noodles: soft, medium, hard or very hard.Love the ramen but am not so sure about the char siew or the 3 layered pork which I didn't find to be tender.Goma Kyuri - crunchy Japanese cucumber with home-made sesame dressing - refreshing.Renkon chips - crispy & tasty lotus root chips - nice & crispy.Beef tataki- well-marbled prime beef slices, pan-seared and served with tangy soy sauce - good.Lemon soda - a non-alcoholic cocktail made with fresh lemons and mint leaves - refreshing
4
I was feeling slightly under the weather with cold feet, nose & throat discomfort. It was 9 p.m, I was not particularly hungry but wanted a bowl of hot noodles. It was Ramen Ippudo's grand opening & I decided to try as I was en route from Bayfront MRT to MBS.Ramen Ippudo has dine in & takeout corners. Business was brisk & the dining area was almost filled to capacity. The atmosphere was rara & lively with cooks & servers greeting customers in loud unison when customers enter & leave.I studied the menus & decided to order from the takeout counter. The waitress promptly showed me to the counter. I was warmly greeted by their Japanese chef.I opted chicken soup ramen, no oil, strong flavour, extra noodle, extra egg, standard onion & garlic. Chef studied my order carefully when keying into the cash register.The commis prepared my noodle while Chef took charge of my soup & plating. While waiting for the soup to boil, we had time for a quick chat. Chef checked the finished product against my order chit again before handing over the finished product. The pace was relaxing. Chef's display of the pride in his work builds up my anticipation to eat his ramen. Best, I paid SGD12 which is almost the average cost of a meal at Rasapura Masters foodcourt.Condiments like white & black pepper in pepper mills, chili flakes & sesame were provided. Utensils were smartly packed in transparent packaging, complete with paper napkin & toothpick.The yellow ramen's texture is somewhat like a thinner version of 'Singapore Hokkien noodle' but had better taste, bite, elasticity & does not get soggy within a short period of time. The broth was rich yet not cloying, sweet, tasty & piping hot to the last. Dice white onion lends a refreshing crunch to the overall taste. The egg has a smooth & flawless exterior & yolk lavas out like how a good lava cake should. The portioning is smaller than most ramen other shops I have tried.I finished all within minutes, instantly felt better & still had appetite for more food

Ippudo ramen is one of my favourite place to eat ramen in Singapore. The best part is the soup however i feel the portion is quite small for the price that i paid. I also had the gyoza and its good just like a normal Japanese gyoza nothing really special. The second time i went i ordered the special chicken and pork ramen, also good like but the best still the special pork based ramen (i forgot the name) should definitely try if you are in Singapore.
5
Love the ramen here! Service is prompt but the food is what really gets me. The pork buns just feel like they melt in your mouth. The ramen soup is just flavourful and not heavy at all! Will be back again soon, for sure!
4
Having had the ramen a few times in one of the branches in Tokyo during a recent visit, I thought I would try it in Singapore. As expected, it is much pricier here with where it is located. But the quality of food seems comparable.
5
Love their ramen but don't forget to must try their sushi. Very nice and fine dining like quality. You will want more and wanna come back again.
3
I used to frequent the branch in Westgate. However they have been changing their menu these recent years which is a let down as it does not taste the same anymore and has more of a fusion vibe to it (Never had experience in other ramen place where you add lemon to your ramen). I hope they will bring back some of their old menus back
5
There is more than one Ippudo in Singapore and this review is for the restaurant that is located at Marina Bay Sands, as there does not seem to be a TA pade for the Marina Bay Sands location. I'd not eaten at a Ippudo before, but after 1 meal I would certainly consider myself a fan. This is an excellent place for a family with children.As you enter the restaurant, you get welcomed in a loud and happy way by the staff! It can be a bit overwhelming for a westerner but go with it and enjoy the attention!The attention from the service staff was flawless and timely and we felt our every need was catered for with ease and quickness.Our family of five had 6 dishes to share between us and spent a total of $84.74 for our lunch. We had gyozas, chahan, ribs, nanban, goma kyuri and niku soba. It was all cooked to perfection and delicious. We would have gone back again for another meal but we ran out of time
1
We were a group of 6 with two elderly grandparents. Three of us arrived half hour early to ensure that we would have a table by the time our grandparents arrived. We were at the front of the queue but had to let several groups proceed before us because our party was not complete. Once our grandparents arrived at the mall, I informed the male waiter that they were here and slowly making their way up. I also informed him that they were in their eighties and it would be very difficult for them to walk/stand for long. He ignored me and immediately proceeded to give a table for 6 people away to a group of 5 people in the queue behind us. I am terribly disappointed with the total lack of commonsense and compassion in this situation
3
Nothing to rave about. Slightly better than average but way too salty and it covered the original freshness of the broth. And yet again another restaurant that charges sky high prices for green tea and lemon soda. $8 for a glass of lemon soda ? No way. The next 2 tables left their lemon drinks half drank. Unlikely to visit again.
5
Definitely one of the best ramen I ever had! You can even choose the texture of the noodles- soft to hard. The soup is delicious. Side dishes like to pork buns are amazing! Price per bowl is higher than the norm but worth the money if you are indulging in a good bowl of ramen once in a while! Service is fast and exceptional.
1
I have lived a bit of time in Osaka and Ippudo was my canteen there. I fell from very high when I went to Ippudo in Singapore. The restaurant itself look more of a high end than the eatery in Japan. Taste of taken is alright, but the gyoza lacks crunchiness. We received our food before the drinks and I also asked them for the pickled bean sprouts we have in Japan but the waiter told me that they don't have that.The worst is the price. For the same food, the cost is twice more expensive compared to Japan! Just extremely disappointed They should just not call them Ippudo..
5
I came to this place on my solitary birthday on 23 Dec 2016. It was full and I have to wait for few mins only. The waitress was so friendly. She asked me to sit down and gave me the menu while waiting for my table. The ramen was good! I ordered the set menu, with additional 5 dollar only you'll get the drink and a side dish like chicken karage (i chose this one), salad and I forget the other one. It is highly recommended!
2
I bought these signature pork buns to take away for my husband at the Shaw centre Singapore , and look what did they put inside , barely anything . There should be a standard thick piece of pork belly . This is disappointing .
4
I really enjoyed this place, it's secluded in a nice shopping mall. The service is good, food was pretty good as well.
3
Hakata black ramen was so so. Tried the other flavored ramen, taste better. Spicy black ramen was good.
5
Food are consistently delicious here. The place gets pretty crowded time to time but all worth it. Beer served properly icy cold. Highly recommended if you happen to be near it.
2
I have been to ippudo in Tokyo and Sydney in the past 6 months. Both were excellent. I had the same dish in both also - the karakamen - at medium spicy, which was just fine. I had it in Singapore (mandarin gallery) and was offered a spiciness scale of zero to 3. I went for 1 given medium was fine in the other two places and you would think 1 on a level of zero to 3 would be under that. I think I suffered internal third degree burns after it and was up all night as a result also.... so beware! Staff were also not great and side orders were very "chain formula" and basically not that nice. Not somewhere I would go back to
2
We were greeted strongly by the whole restaurant of waiters when we entered. The whole time while we were waiting and eating, it was constant waves of loud IRRASHAIMASE, ONEGAISHIMASU etc. Honestly it was just noisy. Hard to have long conversations with the wide tables and we had to raise our voices to be heard.We had to wait more than half an hour for our ramen. It was around 12:10pm on a Friday.The ramen was so-so. No free side dishes. It was a disappointment. I wouldn't return again because of the long wait and noise level not even caused by the diners but the whole army of waiters
4
Haven't been here in years and decided to come for a late night dinner. We had a simple ramen with miso and garlic oil (yum) in broth that came with 2 (pretty generous) slices of pork, some garnishing but no egg (you have to pay more for that). We chose medium consistency for the noodles and I think we made the right choice. It had enough firmness to give bite without feeling hard. We also had one of their clam appetizers in sake topped with shredded yuzu. I guess I was expecting it to taste like mussels in white wine but was surprised (disappointed?) that it didn't. The sake broth was extremely salty. Maybe it's meant to be that way, but it's not something I am used to. The ramen here is probably a few dollars more than what you would pay elsewhere but I guess you're paying for their beautiful chandelier.
4
Japanese ramen in Singapore ! Ramen is delicious & tasty - the way it befits Japanese styled Ramen. The ramen's 'crunchy' and the broth are all well prepared and goes well with the noodles . Fried corn with butter is a nice side dish. Though the food is good or great, the restaurant can be 'loud & noisy ' as it's kind of packed to the max. It can be quite annoying. As one is there for the food & not fine dining; Just put that aside, sit back & enjoy the ramen.
2
Tried this place on 5 Oct 2016, the place was terribly noisy. The server was screamed in my ear thrice asking her colleague to serve the other table when I was trying to order my meal. And as expected, she sort of took my order because the we ordered first but our food did not come. The table beside was already halfway into their meal when I checked and they forgot our order.If the the server did not scream in my ear and forget our orders, I might still return for the mediocre ramen
5
My son had eaten at Ippudo in Japan and was anxious to give this a try. The classic ramen with pork and a touch of meso was really good with a cold beer. This is quick,not fancy, and a great tasting meal. Don't linger, just eat, enjoy and move on
5
This is one of my favourite places for Noodles in Singapore. There are many choices of noodles and the service is also very good. Be aware that there will always be a queue :)
2
It used to be a great Ramen place. Big portions and very tasty .
Unfortunately , It's now a very basic Ramen restaurant : less meat , less vegetables , smaller portions .
Karakamen was a top dish , unfortunately they killed it .
4
This popular chain has 3 types of noodle broths. Including options, it's slightly pricey, but consistently good. The pork buns are also recommended.
Coupled with pleasant interiors, & brisk service; this is a good place for family and friends.
Tables are mostly up to 4
3
The food still tasted nice although somewhat not tasteful. I was hoping a good japanese food usually offered by Ippudo but nothing more and nothing less.
4
The specialities is pork ramen.
In here you can also try nice appetizer and the bun is one of my favorites... Chicken and pork bun.
Enjoy your lunch or dinner.
Cheers.
4
Ippudo Ramen is awesome. The broth is rich and the noodles are springy. Well worth the price. The side dishes are similarly good. The gyoza is almost perfect. Service staff are friendly. There is usually a line for dinner, do arrive early.
3
I have patronised this restaurant frequently for the past few years but recently, when they changed menu in the middle of 2016, somehow the quality has dropped. I always ordered Karakamen with hard noodle. The noodle used to be tasty now it tasted like instant noodle (yellow noodle) and no longer tasty. I have made complaint and they claimed that they have changed the ramen. The price has increased too by about $1 or so.
4
Visited this Ippudo branch today after several years and was extremely glad I did. Their customer service has continued to be pleasant, never overbearing, and consistently friendly. They have managed to reinvent themselves without losing their original identity- that if being a ramen place unlike the other Ippudo branches around the world. The addition to their meat and chicken dishes (with an added promotional discounted Asahi beer offer for every order) and their consistently excellent, flavorful bowls of ramen, pork bums and appetizers makes Ippudo a consistent standout of good Japanese cuisine outside of Japan. And Singapore's branches still do it quite well
5
We have tried ippudo many times. This is the first time I'm giving them a review. Their broth is perfect! The kids love them. They will always give the kids colour pencil & paper for their entertainment before food being served. Staff is very attentive. Nothing beats staff who are more attentive to customers' children. Well done! You will be sure that we are coming back.
4
Love to come here whenever i am around. Their ramen is sooooo good.The unique thing from them is their small space of resto and almost everytime i come, a lot of people want to queue in front of resto just to eat their ramenBut to be frank, their price is so expensive for a bowl of ramen
3
We went for a late dinner to Ippudo. A small but clean restaurant, filled with local people, which is always a good quality indication.
Food is decent and fresh. Nothing too special. Flavors are just right, and so is the price.
3
Visited Ippudo Ramen for lunch after hearing a bit of hype around the chain of restaurants worldwide. The raman was good, but over lunch it was busy and had to wait to get a table. Not a bad experience, but the ramen wasn't anything special.
3
We arrived before 6pm and was given a table within 5 minutes. The place was not full but once when we were seated guests began to arrive. The queue outside was building up. The restaurant was narrow & tables were very near to each other. The atmosphere was a little tense with servers moving around briskly as taking orders. However servicewas prompt & polite.There were 4 adults we ordered a variety of appetizers the Japanese cucumber with soya & sesame seeds were refreshing, the deep fried beets gave a different texture with slight sweetness to the saltiness of the cucumber. The fried chicken wings were delicious. My order Akamaru shinaji was served. I opted for hard ramen the broth came with miso paste, garlic oil, pork belly slices, black mushroom, cabbage & shallots.The broth was tasty rich however found it a little too salty for my liking. The cabbage gave the crunch & crispness. The broth was addictive. It was an enjoyable experience
4
Initial thoughts -- too expensive! But hey I got convinced after I ate, so now i understand the hype about this place.Pros: Food was served fast, and service was prompt. It was tastyyyy too!Cons: Felt a tad rushed? Like they cleared our bowls really fast and asked if we wanted to do any additional orders. I understand there's a queue but... I queued to get my seat too no? We left cause it felt too awkward with the waitress trying to clear us out.Oh yes, they now sell their ippudo instant noodles! I AM SO HOOKED.Can cook at the convenience at home and eat tasty ramen
2
I decided to take my family here on Friday after work. We have been a few times now and have really enjoyed the food, service and atmosphere. Friday's are usually busy around 6pm as people finish work and start their evenings here as families or couples. I had my family over from Europe so in total 8 of us sat down for food and drinks and we wanted to enjoy a final evening together. The experience as always was great. Food, service and ambiance were amazing as usual. We did however felt that we were rushed out of the door. We had only been there 45 minutes and our plates and food were being taken away as soon as we finished them. There was a queue outside which I understand they had to manage but we were paying customers and spent 300 dollars in just over an hour. We actually wanted to stay longer and enjoy the time together more but were increasingly being met with staff hovering around us waiting for us to leave so they could clear the table and let more people in. 5 times we have been to this place but I dont think we will be going back based on the last experience. A real shame. Please dont rush paying loyal patron
4
Well known for ramen yet providing a huge variety of unique appetizers. We ordered for 6 of us various items including our choices of ramen.Everything came at the same time which means while we were still enjoying our appetizers, ramen were served too. Either the kitchen staff were poorly informed or we were not informed to ensure they pace the food served. Otherwise, a good food adventure for our first time here
4
Having visited only once this is my take. Their ramen really is great to the last drop, the broth rich and flavorful with depth and the noodles requested at hard were nice and chewy. If only ramen eggs came with the noodles that would be great.Tried an item off their featured menu of a small steak and it was cooked very nicely medium rare as asked with a great char. The meat itself however was a bit tough and not from being over cooked but possibly the cut itself. Being wagyu grade even lower end wagyu I was not expecting it to have the bite of a med-well steak. Also I was somewhat let down that despite the steak being a small size the side of fries and salad were barely enough for a mouthful. We tried their mojitos which were excellent, a plum based one and a chilli one both which were fabulous and the chilli adding such a great kick to the refreshing drink! Will be going back for ramen but probably only ramen and drinks
5
I will never say no to Ippudo. The thought of you makes my mouth water. When I want ramen done well, I go here.Everytime I visit (trust I have visited many a time), I get the usuals: spicy ramen, the avocado thingy, and the meat in the bun that can come as a trio, duo, or individual---clearly, the food was too good, that the name of the item on the menu didn't even register.Do yourself a favor and visit. Enough said
5
Love this place. Love their spicy dumplings! Their ramen is very delicious as well. I've tried both of their classic and generally prefer the first one. The mini pork buns are pretty good as well although not as good as Momofuku in NYC. But still absolutely delicious
3
With a 8.7/10 rating and a ranking as #1 for ramen in Singapore, and 192 reviews in Foursquare, it didn't take me long to head down to this joint when I was in the vicinity of Orchard to give it a try. After all, there was at least one review which said that the ramen here was comparable to the best ramens in Tokyo. It started well with the Gyoza and the Pork Bun, both while not fabulous, were still quite nice - both in taste and in the moistness & softness. But as for the ramen, I was disappointed by the much touted broth as ... because to me, it lacked both complexity and depth. And I found it rather alkaline (i.e. tasted as if it has a lot of æ¢˜æ°´), leaving me a lingering and uncomfortable sense of fullness after drinking just a third of it. As for the noodle itself, I found it very ordinary, just like any Jap restaurant ramen elsewhere. The saving grace was that most of the waitresses were patient, courteous and helpful. One of them thoughtfully asked whether we wanted to cut the pork bun into two as we were sharing, while another asked how we found the meal, and if we had any issues with it. Due to the preceding dishes and the service, my overall experience was okay, but it will take a lot from me to return as it is costly even by Jap ramen standards

Never disappoint you. After my monthly haircut in Mandarin gallery, I always stop by here to have quick ramen. food always in the standard, fast and nice service.
3
I have been to this place in Japan. I think the one in Japan is better. I like the gyoza, it's as good as in Japan. It can be an option if you want to eat ramen in Singapore.

IppudoShaw CentreHad ramen at their Mandarin Gallery outlet once and wasn't impressed.Though I'd try it one more time at their Shaw Centre outlet.Given fried garlic, sesame seeds and Chilli flakes to add to taste.Bonito Tonkotsu (ramen) medium texture - 2 strips of thinly sliced 3-layered pork, some crunchy bamboo shoots and thin noodles. Can choose texture of noodles - soft, medium or hard. Soup was a bit rich but at least it was piping hot.Side orders: egg and satsuma age (fish cake) - comes in a soup. Soup was not hot!Fish cake was soft which is not to my liking.Iced green tea - not free.Verdict: No big deal
5
Refreshingly efficient, attentive service who didn't misunderstand my requests and generally responded very quickly. This was despite the restaurant being completely packed, with dim lighting and tables pretty near each other. Plus we were sitting in the corner. There was a queue at the start but it moved pretty fast and you could easily look at the menu while waiting. Food was great too. The ramen broths are the best, and not excessively salty. You can choose how hard or soft you want your noodles! Unfortunate the beef steak dish was disappointing - the steak wasn't evenly cooked so some pieces were overcooked and too chewy. But it's a ramen restaurant. And the ramen was perfect. So 5 stars for Ippudo.

The best outlet among the 4 in Singapore! Located just beside Mandrain Hotel, I love the cold noodle set that come tgt w salad n a hot green tea. Great for dining alone during the non peak hour in the afternoon about 3pm ^^ It is very quiet in e afternoon as there isnt as much crowd as there are compare to other outlet. U can even catch a movie at cineleisure that is just beside mandrain gallery after the meal !

100 sing dollars for three - good fresh meal, with very friendly service from the staff. We had an excellent bowl of ramen, beef tataki, the trademark soft pork buns and several other appetizers. There is an extensive sake menu as well. Good for family and friends
3
We liked: bright red bowls, ramen hardness to order (from soft to very hard), garlic grinder, fresh cut scallions all add to a big bowl of soupy comfortWe didn't like: 20 minute wait, waiters brought 2 extras in the ramen we didn't order bit charged us for them; we didn't push back since we waited a long time already, and no refill of hot water for the green teaFor the three of us, the bill came to $101, definitely overpriced for soupy comfort. Mak's noodles in CentrePoint would be half the price for same comfort
4
Had dinner here at the Shaw outlet last weekend. Be prepare to queue up as it is one of the popular places now for ramen. Not sure if you can make reservation, but please do if possible. Cost: Slightly above average/mid range.Besides ramens (the S size is really small), we had gyoza (not bad) as well as the buns (3 flavors) - all was pretty good. Recommended. Downside is the ramen has MSG, therefore you may feel thirsty after. Nearest MRT station: Orchard MRT. Exit.If this review is helpful, please click on the "Helpful" button. Thanks

Had the idea to eat Ramen and Ippudo came to mind immediately. Ordered the Shiromaru, with hard noodles. Very very tasty. (The only thing, seems MSG is being used as it made me really thirsty later that night. Hence my 4 rating only. This is disappointing, in this day and age to still put MSG in cooking.).The dessert is delicious, will go back try the other desserts
4
Went here on a weekday around 2PM to have a late lunch with my collegue and there's still a long queue going on. We came all the way to have this ramen so we decided to wait. After about 20 minutes, we got our table and order straight away. My friend had Spicy Black Pepper Ramen and I got Shiromaru Motoaji which is Ippudo's signature with pork broth. Both of them are delicious and tasty, however I felt so thirsty after that
4
Unlike the Ippudo's in Japan this one serves a whole variety of dishes beside the ramen noodles (for which it is famous). The food is excellent, esp. those noodles!
It is a very busy place, but well worth the visit.
5
its not my first time having my meal here. but definately come back as they serve very good ramen. very tasty. and also nice location here
5
The spicy black pepper ramen is so packed with flavor and black pepper spice, it is delicious. Take it up a notch with chili oil! You won't be disappointed!
4
The chain offers nice ramen and pork bun. Usually visit the outlet at Westgate. Expect to queue especially during peak hours for lunch and dinner.
4
We came to the Shaw Centre outlet after movies at Lido. Seated in the bar counter. Ramen was served pretty quick after order. Also ordered the gyoza and BBQ corn. No fuss, good ramen.
5
This was our first visit here i had the Pork Buns which were very good not chewy goid over all. Price was average not expensive good service.
5
best ramen. You can choose the noodles hardness. I think this is great. The soup has so much flavor. You have to try this casual restaurant if you like ramen. Casual place with no pretensions just good ramen.
4
With our offiice in Shaw Centre, my colleague and I dropped in Ippudo at Shaw Centre last month for sake and food pairing.It was sake and otsumami pairing. The otsumami (tapas size) was offered at a nominal price of $6. We ordered 4 cups of sake (I think for $36?) to taste with the various otsumami.Top on my list is Tedorigawa Shukon Jumei Ginjo which was smooth and went well with the food paired. It was not too much mild (1st cup) thus had a nice kick to it.Ippudo remains our fav joint for the pork soup stock ramen - the quality is consistent and we know that we are eating authentic Hakata pork ramen.The service staff might be a bit aloof compared to their friendlier counterparts in Japan
5
Ippudo is a chain restaurant and available in multiple locations in Singapore and elsewhere. Our teenage daughter often drags us there, but all of us enjoy it big time. While Ramen is obviously THE food to order, we are also enjoying the steamed and fried Gyozas as well as the spicy corn cobs. Yummyyyyyy
4
The Pork bun at Ippudo is a must try. Delicious! sauce so yummy and the pork so tender.. no wonder it was one of the best sellers. The pork bun comes with a smooth soft bun sandwiching the braised pork, drizzled with Ippudo's original sauce and don't forget your ramen! So good! Always a busy place in Mandarin Gallery!
3
We went there as we were told this Ramen hause is the best one in Singapore and it turned out quite ok for the ramen, but i found the portion was too small.
1
Subpar ramen quality combined with very poor service (e.g. No proper queue system, drink menu not given, chili pepper not served - I have to take from other table myself)
3
I find their noodle satisfactory, no wow factor.. The soup is average. Ok place to visit but if I have to queue, I will go other places.
5
the original taste is maintained well in this ramen shop :). gotta be there before noon time (like 11AM or 11:30AM) or else you have to wait like 30-60 minutes to get a seat :D
2
Despite the queues, their ramen is overrated and their other dishes are disappointing. Not worth standing in line for a table and have to end up sharing tables with others. There are better ramen places out there serving better food at lower prices.
1
By normal Japanese standard, the food is amazingly subpar. Smallest gyoza for 8 bucks, seaweed and others are not included, but optional extras. The noodle has no soul and you don't feel it's handmade, but rather the same type you can find from a good insta pack. The tonkotsu broth smells strongly of pig and the char Siew is pretty hard. So bad that I couldn't finish it, and I am a huge ramen lover.
3
On my first visit, the ramen was really nice. However, when I visited again this year, the taste seems to be different and the soup base was very very salty. Service is ok. I tried to cut the queue by going early. This is not a place where you can sit long and chit chat with your friends as there is always long queue outside waiting for a table
4
The house ramen specialty is the classic hakata-style ramen, with a tasty broth that is just right. Not too thick with collagen/pig skin. Reminded me of the one in NYC - Toto Ramen. However, I also tried its Gyoza and it was a big disappointment. Don't think they even made it inhouse, more likely pre-packed. Just stick to the ramen, you wouldn't be disappointed
4
We visited the Shaw Centre branch which is not listed on TripAdvisor and I was unable to register this outlet as a new venue! Notwithstanding the service staff were very helpful and the food was served promptly. We enjoyed the spicy salad with pork but the chicken wings were overly sweet. The dumplings were tasty as was the spicy ramen.Overall we were pleased with our meal and will return to try some of the other signature dishes. The prices are reasonable
4
I was quite lucky because every time I came to this restaurants there is no queue at all so i got seated right away. I ordered the spicy ramen, which was to die for if you can handle spicy food! The original tonkatsu sauce is also another good choice. The chasu was cooked to perfection, it is really similar to the one I had in Japan! The gyoza was really good as well. Overall, i would definitely recommend this restaurant if you are a ramen love
4
Great ramen there. The crispy chicken salad is great too. I order a couple other dishes there and all of them tasted splendid. Better make a reservation because the place is always full.
5
Family dinner, good Ramen. What else is needed! Creative modern Ramen. Sure is a place we will come back to. You should too.
4
Great food at reasonable price. Generally consistent standard when compared to the ippudo overseas. Worth dining there.
5
had a late dinner here one evening.
food was great, high quality, authentic and served quick
very affordable and would recommend to all
4
What stood out was the service staff at Ippudo. I did not remember the first time (which was few years ago) being this polite , friendly and professional. Well, could be due to the competitive landscape of ramen in Singapore! I like that we can choose the hardness of the noodles- Soft, medium to hard.The croquette was a pleasant surprise. It turned out to be good starter.Price of one bowl of ramen is not cheap. If the price could be lower a little, it would be perfect
4
I've heard of Ippudo ramen from my friend but I've never tried it because I've always gone back to my first favourite ramen in Singapore. But one day, we decided we should try something new. So we went. And we like it. By the way, we went to the one in Shaw Centre.The ramen soup is on the light side. Different type for me, but it's fragrant and delicious. If you're having other side dishes, the ramen soup will not cover the other taste, it wasn't overly strong.Just nice.We've tried tsukune rice, spicy chicken wings and beef tataki for the sides. I really like tsukune rice, the patty was nicely done! Spicy chicken wings are okay, beef tataki was not bad too! Definitely trying more different types of sides the next time we go
5
We had gone to see a movie at Shaw Centre. After movie we were looking for a place to eat. Found Ippudo on the way to the car park. It was excellent. Food was very good and reasonably priced. Service excellent. Will go again and again
4
So glad that Ippudo now has another outlet close to my office. The latest addition at L4 of Shaw Centre even features a little bar for pre/post meal drinks (sake!), aptly named Bar Ippudo. What I love is their version of the ramen (the long and straight, springy type) and customers get to choose between soft, medium or hard. My friends and I chose the hard which was done with just the right QQ-ness. The Shiromaru Motoaji ramen we had for lunch was so yummy that I would have finished the entire bowl of broth if not for the fact that I still had to deal with the mini bowl of rice-of-the-day that came with my set for a top-up of $4 (+ choice of drink). What a deal! Service was good and efficient too
5
Nothing's beat ippudo's ramen and pork bun!! The ambience is really cozy together with the spotlight. The staff are polite and friendly in any request we made. The first taste of the reman was heavenly. The texture of the noodle was soft as requested and the soup base was superior!! Excellent is the only word to describe
5
The best ramen in Malaysia!!! The texture of the noodles can be changed depending on our preference.. I love the soft textured as always. Queue is not as long as their service is efficient. Not only the food is great, the staffs are very friendly and attentive too! I love akamaru shinaji the most, pork belly ESP! Will def come back again
5
This restaurant would be truly fantastic if they could abandon the curious habit of a chorused welcome for customers. It's confusing, then flattering, and finally as you enjoy your food and more customers arrive, it becomes irritating.
The service is exemplary as is the food.

Great Ramen
Good choice of soups
Staff very very fast, extremely polite
Really surprised
Good food and good value
Ice cold beers
A must visit
Noodles are tasty
3
the spicy rame is good, also the grilled corn and gyoza. expecting a long queue during lunch or dinner hours
4
I lived in Japan for quite some time, and I have traveled around the world a bit so for me it's quite hard to eat something "not entirely local" in a different country from where the food was invented. I love ramen, so going at Ippudo was a bit of a challenge under certain points of view, but being in Singapore I take less risks than eating ramen in Europe for example. Anyhow, Ippudo ramen is very close to the real deal, tonkotsu soup is rich and tasty, ramen are perfectly made, no complaints there.Only note of demerit is the fake Japanese atmosphere, where everyone shouts in Japanese welcome phrases but know no real Japanese language apart from those lines. Then again, it's all part of the atmosphere so it doesn't really matter in the end..
4
Haven't been here for almost a year. All i could say it tasted as good as it was. Loved the noodle, the tasty sinful but awesome broth ... Price has increased, the only drawback.I always ask for raw garlic cloves to accompany my ramen, though general service had always been great since day one we ate there many years ago, tonight one of the waiter gave me a weird "look-down-upon" face when I asked for the garlic. Hope he knows he's being rude, but i'm not gonna stereotype the whole service crew for one dumb-fool .
4
Nice space. Excellent and friendly service. A lot of japanese patrons. The ramen soup was very fragrant, the best I have had in Singapore . They let you choose the firmness of the noodles which I find very cool ! The menu is quite interesting with in particular an amazing Signature Pork Bun which really melts in your mouth, good Gioza , fresh Edamame. French Ramsey was very pleased by the overall quality

1) Location: Strategic and easy to find!Situated in Mandarin Gallery Orchard Road. Take the red line mrt and stop at Somerset set station. Mandarin Gallery is just 3 mins walk from Somerset mrt station. 2) Environment : Small and pack!The restaurant is rather small and if you dine during peak hours like lunch or dinner, there would be a queue of 15-30 mins. Serves is good and courteous!3) Food : Thick soup base and quality ingredient!I personally like the original, able to taste the original ramen taste. I can taste the soup is boiled with pork bone and many good ingredients to thicken the soup.You can choose the way the noodle is being cook whether hard medium or soft. I took the medium done and it was perfectly cooked.4) Price : Ranges from sgd$15-30 per bowl including taxWe paid about sgd$40 per person including drinks and some snacks 5) FYI : NON
2
The broth is more salty, less full bodied. There is no dried fungus and bamboo shoots is replaced by strips of chinese cabbage - LAME!! There are no additional condiments such as bean sprouts etc you find at Ippudo Japan. PLUS it costs 50% more than in Japan. Was definitely under-happy eating at Ippudo Singapore. Will avoid it unless desperate...even then, think I'll go for other ramen
4
Whenever I have craving for ramen, I will come to Ippudo. The noodle is soft, thin and very delicious broth. Location is convenient too, alight at somerset MRT and walk to mandrian gallery. The only cons is you have to be there early to queue up as the place. Make sure your friends/ family member are there physical else you wont be able to be seated. (limited seats)Do come early to avoid the long Q, if its around 7 pm you will have to queue for 30-45 mins before you can have your yummy ramen
4
Although Ippudo has just opened in Jakarta recently, but I like the one in Singapore more. I really love the ramen - the texture is soft, very tasty and clear broth, and the side dishes are soooo delicious. One menu that I love the most is the pork BBQ which served on hotplate :) I always get myself this ramen every time I go to Singapore.Love it !!
5
I love the akamaru ramen! add tamago (egg) for extra kick.
Their potato salad is delicious too. Do try to come earlier to avoid long queues. 12pm for lunch or 6.60pm for dinner.
4
this ramen taste very gooood.... it is worth waiting the queue.... the soup is superb....noodle very bouncy....must try for ramen lover
4
No single bowls or spoons match, that's what makes this place to fun. The noodles are pricy, but awesome. Add an egg to whatever noodles you get and you will be very satisfied.
4
Quite impressive that despite the queue the turnover was fast and efficient. We (2 of us). had a salad, steamed spicy Goya and ther signature ramen. Just nice to sample their food. A bit pricey though.
5
Can't understand the bad reviews but I think ippudo is fantastic. I always visit when I am in Singapore. Glad to see the standard hasn't dropped. Service is always good too.
5
Back home in Manila, ippudo always have long lines so when I saw ippudo just below our hotel Mandarin orchard, and no line yet at 5 pm, me and my hubby tried it or the first time. The noodle soup is just perfect. I like the steam Gyoza too. Will definitely go back to ippudo
4
Very good noodle or ramen. The cold and half boiled soft eggs is very delicious. The prices are moderate. The place is full of young people and yuppies waiting in line to get in.The pork and seafood ramen is a good choice to start with
1
Went to the famous Ippudo restaurant and instead of a gastronomical experience, we had a disappointing encounter with the Maitre d' who showed a total lack of interest in his clients. We wanted a table for 7 and were asked to wait until a table became available. After some time, the waiter came along and suggested that we take the unused/unbooked private room for a minimum spend of SGD$280. (roughly twice of what you would spend on a meal for 7). We declined. Second option was to have two separate tables not next to each other or even close by. We declined again. Third option was to have the Private dining room (still unbooked) for a maximum time of 35mins including ordering and eating!!!By this time, we were starving not to mention quite frustrated. We suggested the Private room for 40 mins after ordering, to which the unfriendly waiter decided to have an empty Private dining room than to have our custom.Instead we went to the excellent Din Tai Feng - rated as one of the Top Ten Restaurants by the New York Times in the Mall opposite. We ended up dining in a Private room after all!Beware of the unfriendly not customer focussed staff
5
Heaven in a bowl. I had the modern style ramen with succulent, melting, unctuous, butter like slices of pork belly, and with an extra spoon of bean paste. If you eat this more than once a week it will also probably be a heaven by the end of the year from a coronary. And it would have been worth it! Highly recommended
3
When I first came here a year ago, I had to line up behind more than 10 people, which made me look somewhere else for dinner. Now there is no such queue anymore, not sure if this is because the novelty wore off or the quality went down. Anyway I tried many different ramen restaurants, so for me the quality is about average
1
Honestly speaking,i don't like their remem Akamaru Chashu. too much MSG and it overpriced not worthy the $$$. same as china so much MSG very thirsty ..
5
In short BEST RAMEN you will ever have! Love the atmosphere and simplicity of a beautiful bowl of Ramen. These guys know what they are doing!
3
I had been Ippudo for 3 times. 1st 2 times I got the original tonkatsu ramen. So the 3rd time I am thinking to have something different so I chose spicy version. The spicy version is totally not spicy, really no spiciness at all. It costed me $26 for all in as the plain one already $21. I wanted flavoured egg and it cost $3 for one. This should be the most expensive flavoured egg I had in Singapore. I wanted charsiew so in the end I just got the all in version. My 1st 2 experience was not bad as the soup is one of the not really salty version. However, this time round I am not sure what happened, the soup base - very salty, the char siew - very very favoured aka salty, the bamboo shoot - somehow also salty, the egg - really nice but I think we are too early so it was cold, noodles - curly and just nice. Overall, it is nice but this is the most expensive ramen in town, still there is really queue if you go during the actual lunch and dinner hour
3
Didn't like the noodle texture, tasted like instant noodle. The broth was ok, not the best I've tasted. The side dishes are expensive for very small portions and most shocking is their green tea, they charge $3 for a small glass & non refillable. The only good thing I can say is their service is very pleasant. My bill came to $98 for 2 pax. 2 bowls of Ramen, some side dishes and 4 glasses of green tea. A pretty expensive noodle lunch
2
No idea why the lines are so long here. After waiting for at least 30 min to get a table, ordered their speciality Akamaru Shin-Aji Ramen (presented in a red bowl). Taste was nothing out of the ordinary despite the hype. In fact I prefer the ramen with yellow noodle from Ramen Play! Had a few other things that were not that memorable Ã¢â‚¬â€œ beef tataki, deep-fried chicken, spicy chicken wings. The bark here is literally louder that the bite
4
Went with my boyfriend who had been here before so i didn't have to stare too long at the menu. We ordered shriomaru hakata ramen and hirata pork bun. The ramen was just ok but the pork bun is really delicious! Best pork bun i've ever eaten. Though it's a bit pricey for a bowl of ramen, but worth to tr
4
Went the one in Mandarin Gallery for dinner 1 day after spa... Did not experience the queue probably it is a weekday after 9pm.. Crowd is before 9 or probably between 730-830?0In terms of variety of other side orders, they probably do have some fusion selection which other ramen places do not have. Asked for Garlic, they do not have does Garlic flakes, thus provided me with the actual garlic where I need to grind myself. Ramen to me wasn't the best. I like the Bread with Tuna and Avocado.. forgot the name of this dish but I simply love that dish..
5
I went to the Ippudo at Westgate Mall in Jurong. It's amazing something this amazing is in a mall, let alone Jurong, but thank goodness it is. there are some mixed reviews here, I imagine that's because it's super busy at the Orchard Road location - at Westgate, more relaxed, more spacious, very attentive staff. The menu is very diverse, noodles of every shape and form. I suggest for your first time to try the classic to ensure you start from a strong base - and then for the next meal, experiment some more. The ramen choices are just outstanding, and the appetizers were' quite fresh and very Japanese-style flavored, too. Highly recommended
3
Be prepared to wait for 20 to 30 minutes, even at 9.30 pm! It is a very popular place for young adults as it is located next to the fashionable Orchard Cineplex, and the heart of Orchard Road Shopping District. The small and contemporary resturant could seat about 40 to 50 guests, but the turnover is fast. Serving of food is speedy once you are seated, and service is good. You could order the noodle in 4 textures - very hard, hard, medium and soft. And you could also order additional noodle to go with the soup if you are a big eater. The special Karaka noodle that comes with flavoured egg, pork cube and bamboo shoots cost > S$30, canned Sapporo beer S$10.60 -- A simple noodle meal could set you back S$40.50! The other side dishes are equally pricy, but rather ordinary. Go for the noodle as the pork soup is salty, flavourful, and addictive! PS They stop providing fresh garlic, perhaps to cut cost
4
As an expat staying in Singapore for almost four years, I would by no means say I am an expert when it comes to reviewing and critiquing Asian food. However, for someone who has taken ramen only a few times during my stay in Asia, I would have to label the food at this place as pretty good. I really like the pork and egg and the soup was spicy. I just wish I would have tried this place earlier. The queue was long but moved along nicely and the service was good especially considering the restaurant was jammed. If I ever have the opportunity to try this place or one similar to it I would not hesitate
3
Good ramen but not the best for me. Because their soup is not thick like in tokyo. Not enough spicy / hot for me.
4
this place is really popular.
The ramen is nice. I wish they have more variety, like Tsukemen, and Tokyo style ramen.
3
The ramen is overrated and the service is terrible. I went to the branch at West Gate and the queue is terrible. The service is terrible, they always trying to chase the customers off by clearing away the food even when people are still trying to finish the food. They are stingy with their ice water, and they can't even spare you hot water for the tea pot. The ramen is just average, the soup is salty. The pork is good but on the whole, the pricing is not competitive
4
If you have spoken to your friends in Tokyo, they would be surprised you know Ippudo (which is also famous in Japan!)We stayed at Mandarin Hotel, and was doing getting our company websites up with staff from Chenrong.sg at Chatterbox for lunch, when we came across this restaurant. A little pricey, but the noodles are specially made. We shared tables with everyone, which is a different experience. Slurp your noodles to make it extra Japanese and delicious
3
Been trying out new restaurants lately being Jun holidaysBe prepared to wait, we waited 30minsWhat is special about this restaurant is that you decide the texture of your ramen which is good esp some ramen can be too soggy or too hard for me.We ordered 1)Pork Bun2)Miso Gyoza3)Akamaru Kakuni4)Shiromaru Chashu5)Shiromaru Kakun1 & 2 portion quite miserable portion for the price 3,4,5 unique n soup was thick and niceOverall, price is on the higher side but then I do not see any Jap chef in the restuarant at all It was noisy and I don't really like the dining experienc
2
Waited 20 minutes for food after ordering and when asked they said our order wasn't processed and asked us to reorder. Really bad service from a bowl cut hair waitress who had some attitude problem who didn't process our order. They Gave a 10 percent discount voucher but they really need to replace the waitress with the weird attitude. Their service and food quality has really dropped since the first time they opened. Maybe since the Japanese chefs have already gone
4
We waited over an hour for a table on a Friday night, so I would recommend going another night with a group greater than 2 people, or going on Friday night as a couple. They did allow us to order beers while we waited, which made a big difference.I had never eaten true Ramen, so this was exciting. If you are suspicious of new foods, maybe don't get the egg. Stick with the pork belly option for the noodle bowls. I Had thre Kamara special. It was quite yummy, with a thick and spicy broth. We also had Gyoza and wanted about 10 more orders. My husband got a beef steak in Japone sauce, which was a delicious tiny portion. My soup was $26, but there are options around $18. I think the Gyoza was $6 or $8. The beer was pretty cheap as well, with $6 options. Reasonably priced, great food. Definitely worth a visit in Singapore. Oh, it might be tough to find. It is up a number of escalators past other restaurants in the Mandarin Gallery area

Heard of this restaurant that serve 'so-called great' ramen from my family when they were in Singapore. I decided to try it out since my family members give rave review. Were told that we must go early or else the queue will be long. This was true as when we each the restaurant, there was already a long queue building up. We waited nearly an hour for our seat. I order the black ramen with extra noodles and some beef cubes. You can feel the beef cubes melting in your mouth. Both beef cubes and ramen were really good especially the beef cubes. Go for the spicy ramen if you like hot stuff. The price is slightly on the high side but with such great food, you will pay for it anyhow but maybe you wont visit often. I think the management need to re-look into how to capture the customers by ensuring that they dont wait too long for a seat. I nearly give up waiting and proceed to nearby restaurant but were persuaded to wait and try the food. Overall it was a great experience but if you were to ask whether I would want to go there again, I will think twice unless they can reduce the waiting tim
4
If you like Ramen, you must try Ippudo. It can get really busy, but tables rotate really fast. It's inside the Mandarin Gallery shopping mall, which unfortunately is one of the worst in Singapore's Orchard Road. Food at Ippudo is great, try all types of Ramen, and accompany them with pork / chicken buns, delicious. Price is the only downturn, as you can easily spend 50 SGD per person
3
It's good... Certainly one of the better ones around... But not better than in Fukuoka.. And more importantly, a bowl or ramen ('special' or not), with small plate of gyoza and a Coke, should not cost almost S$50!It was 'good' but am giving an 'average' because of the price factor..
4
Great place and good value food selection. Enthusiastic staff. A little noisy but fun. Fast service and good variety.
4
It's been sometime since I visited ippudo and I must say the taste and standard is still the same; just as good. The broth is rich and tasty and the char siew literally melts in your mouth (the fatty parts). Thumbs up chefs...
2
This ramen fresh but pricey and not worth it for the queue. The soup and ramen is still okay but the dumpling teribble.
2
Honestly, i do not know what people sees in it. We went there last Friday, was already 21.30 and we had to wait at least 30 minutes just to be seated. i must say that once seated the food was very quick, but i did not find all the great things that people talk about.Maybe my choice was not appropriate to my taste, but my Ramen was really really salty, and nothing special, yes the noodle are nice, but like in a lot of other place without spending that much.I would not probably go back there, maybe is not just a kind of Ramen that i like
1
After hearing how good ippudo ramen is after neon years I finally brought my family here to try. Seriously overrated I must say. The ramen seemed to be machine made and tasted more like shanghai lamian more than Japanese ramen. The soup is a tad too salty. If you don't like to salty becareful not to order miso base or anything with miso. I removed the miso toppings from my tonkotsu ramen, the soup is still salty. The ingredients are extremely meagre. 2half pieces of pork belly was all I get. My hubby stir the whole bowl and could only find one. By the mid bowl, all ingredients are gone except the noodles. Disappointing! Really don't understand why it is attracting th crowd. If not happened to be near the area, don't even bother!

This time, I would like to share my recent experience in dining in at Ippudo Singapore during my recent visit in the island last month. The location of this particular Ippudo in Singapore was quite easy to find as it was located in the prime (commercial) area (Orchard Road), in a newly built structure.This time, in order to avoid a big crowd and long queue, I decided to go there around 5:00 pm where the big crowd was not there. When I arrived, I could see the restaurant was almost 70% full and I could not get even my own table. For seconds, I was even thinking to leave the place and return back within an hour, a decision that I might regret if I did that.No more than 15 minutes after I got seated, the place was completely full and I started seeing a queue of patrons waiting outside by the time I left the restaurant slightly after 6:00 pm. For me, it was no surprise at all to find many people visiting this establishment after dining in over there. In my personal opinion, Ippudo Singapore has successfully positioned themselves as one of the best places for noodle lovers. One the main distinction they have compare to other Ippudo I had visited outside Singapore is the fact that you are able to select your preference on how you would like your noodles to be served (soft, soft to medium, medium etc.).Overall, I would personally recommend this establishment to everybody who doesn't mind paying premium price for quality ramen/noodle : It's really worth the money

Be prepared to wait in line. We ate here one night and i don't see what all the fuss is about. We both ordered Ramen and they seated us facing the kitchen (on the bench) which was fine given we didn't want to wait any longer (it had been 15min already to get in)
4
I recently came back from a 2 week holiday in Japan and so before even stepping into the restaurant my expectations were pretty high. This was my first time eating at Ippudo and since my friend recommended it I thought I'd give it a try.Started queuing around 6 15pm and had to wait about 15 mins. While waiting, a waitress took our order. I had the basic ramen (I forgot the name) with an extra egg and bamboo shoots. They then proceeded to show us our seats. My group had 3 people and the restaurant was pretty full already so they asked if we were alright with sharing a table. We had no issues there so we sat down. The food took an okay amount of time to reach us, compared to the insane speed in Japan. Took my first bite, and I must say, the soup is tasty, not too salty and the noodles are just right. Not too hard, not too soft. The meat however, I thought was slightly too hard for my liking. Its not that I don't have teeth, its just that I prefer the meat in my ramen to be more tender. The egg was yummy so was the bamboo shoots. The portion of the bamboo shoots was a lot and I couldn't finish it. Overall, it was a satisfying meal that tasted pretty good and pretty authentic. Would I go back? Yes, but only at a reasonable non-peak time

My fiancÃƒÂ© works here, but I will still be giving an unbiased personal opinion. Food is fast. Ramen is one of the bests I've had, fresh and tasty! Place is small, and often crowded. So come early or come early before 10PM.Service is one of the bests! Price is very reasonable

Before I visited, I heard many good reviews about them. After my first visit - which I was impressed - I have been back at least thrice, bringing different friends to introduce them to the delicious ramen served here. This outlet does not allow reservations, and it is not uncommon to see long queues outside the popular restaurant, especially during lunch and dinner hours. The good thing is that the lines are usually cleared very fast.I have tried several types of Ramen here before, but let me share the two most memorable ones. The wonderful thing about their noodles is that it consists of fine strands, springy, and the service crew would ask for "Doneness" of noodles - hard or soft. Yes, this is the unique point of Ippudo's ramen - usually I opt for harder noodles.First, the Shiromaru Special - original tonkotsu (pork) broth served with thin noodles, pork loins, cabbage, kikurage and spring onions - on the side are flavored egg, tender pork cube and bamboo shoots. I absolutely love their soups, regardless of which type of ramen I eventually end up ordering. They are always in-your-face delicious, flavored at full blasts, and non-greasy. Being a fan of flavored eggs (their "braised egg" is rather different from the other Japanese restaurants' - the inside is tenderly raw while the outside is hard-boiled) and bamboo shoots, the entire combination makes for a really hearty meal.I also love their Spicy Black Pork Ramen -I would add the flavored egg as this does not come with it. Another blend of scrumptious soup base, quality thin noodles, bamboo shoot and best of all, black pork. Somehow, black pork has a luscious, delectable taste in additional to its extreme tenderness. I am usually not a fan of pork, but I do enjoy black pork. The tastiness of black pork cooked with delicious broth and noodles, makes for a very gratifying meal.For more detailed information and photos, do visit:http://thearcticstar.blogspot.sg/2013/12/dinner-at-ippudo.htm

One of the best ramen places in Singapore. The taste of the soup, texture of noodles, atmosphere, reminds one of eating a hot bowl of ramen in Japan. Its worth the queue.
4
Do try out their Ramen with Tamago and not to miss the pork bun and Gyoza! ..........................
5
nothing beats ippodu for ramen.....we got the private room for our family Christmas dinner. no one was disappointed. Have now visited ippodu in Japan, Singapore and NY.....although menus are slightly different, the ramen is to die for
3
I have to admit that the ramen here was pretty good, compared to what other local ramen restaurants offered. I had the Akamaru Special while my partner had a Shoyu ramen.The soup of the Akamaru was thick and full of flavor - the noodles were chewy and done just right (I ordered a "medium" hardness noodle). The pork was pretty good and soft without tasting as dry as chicken breast meat.However, the Akamaru didn't come with an Ajitama egg by default - I had to order it as an addon. When the Ajitama was served with the noodles, it was disappointing as the yolk was not runny.Overall the ramen was great, but this place can get crowded during dinner times, so you have to go there early. The atmosphere is not good for dating or business, but more for with friends as the place gets quite rowdy during peak hours. The value aspect of the food was a little lacking as well (though some may feel it is actually worth it as the restaurant is in a prime location with high rentals). The only salvation aspect is probably that their service is quite good and the staff are very attentive to the patron's requests
5
Ippudo had standard quality. I had try them in Japan, Taiwan and Hong Kong. I just love their noodle specially the broth. Their gyoza and pork bun are good too. These are the type of noodle house you can rely. Same quality at any branch you have
5
Came to the legendary ippudo in mandarin gallery and although i had highExpectations due to all the reviews and comments but i was quite impressedAnd it lived up to the hype.Had the basic pork broth ramen with extra hard noodles. Not too oily,Extremely tasty and noodles were springy! Wife had the spicy red chasuAnd she claims its the best she has had and we have tried most of the heavyweightJapanese ramen.Interiors were beautiful, staff polite and courteous. Did not have to line up but oneFormed soon after we left. Loved it and will be back for sure

Ippudo A ramen place which many locals claim to be one of Singapore top ramen. Located on the 4th level of Mandarin Gallery.Took us a few attempts before we give it a try. What can I say the line is absolutely nut. At 1830h we start our line up and we did not get in till 1910h only to share a table with 3 others patron. Nice trendy decoration. the price range from $4-$6SGD for appetizers and $18-$22SGD for the ramen with $2 extra for noddles. Drink is $7-$9 SGD or $50SGD for a bucket of premium malt. Deserts are at $5SGDI went with the popular choice Spicy Black for $18 and an avocado Japanese salads. The service was super quick within 5 mins the food was served. Salad was ok nothing special. The Spicy Black was not at all spicy, reasonable size, two slice of porks and teaspoon of mince meat. Taste was ok. If this was one of the best ramen I hate to try the average or the worst.

Delicious ramen in a place that's very, very popular with locals and visitors, alike. We ate early to avoid the queues. Staff greet each group enthusiastically, on arrival. Efficient, helpful service. We loved our shrimp and spicy pork buns, to start. The spicy tonkotsu and shoyu wanton-men were faultless
4
Located at the 4th floor of the Mandarin Gallery, Ippudo still gets long lines. At least, you will be queueing up in more comfortable, air-conditioned surroundings unlike out in the streets or narrow corridors for branches in other countries. Service is quick and efficient so the wait is bearable. Besides, being in line gives you time to make the hard decisions - akamaru or the seasonal ramen? Hard or soft noodles? Which sidings? And so o
4
Usually long Q at this restaurant n usually im too hungry to Q so always give it a miss. Happen to dine in here last wk as im having very late lunch and there id only 2 or 3 in the Q. The ramen paste is quite special, the fried corn also very yummy, also the salmon salad w some greens. The environment of the restaurant is nice ... it was deco w lots different bolw n spoon.
3
Be prepared to fork out $20-25 once you add an egg and pay taxes etc. Good ramen (my memory of the Hakata branch in japan was too long ago to compare) but not cheap
4
Must have their signature ramen and their steam bun with braised pork belly. Do go early before around 11am if you do not want to wait.
4
We were there before the lunch crowd, even then we had to queue. We waited for about half an hour before we were seated. This was highly recommended and it was my first time trying this chain of restaurant.I liked the idea while we were on the queue around a bar-like table top, menus were available for us to go through our orders mentally. It would have been nicer if there were some tit-bits or sweet for us to munch or plain water to quench our thirst. Once we were seated, our orders were taken. Since it was our first time, the servers gave us certain recommendations base upon our taste buds. Although the place was full, our order came at an acceptable time frame. I was recommended the spicy ramen but for me I found it tame, almost non-spicy. But I am not complaining. We ordered a few side orders. One of it was the hard boiled egg. The uniqueness of this side order was the york, it was soft. It was expensive just for that uniqueness. The way the ramen was prepared for each customer was unique. It was like ordering your steak. I preferred the medium, not too soft nor too hard. I think the broth is the key ingredient that makes the ramen so good. If you want good ramen, here is the place. You can skip the side dishes nothing very special unless we missed out some of it.I rated the "Families with Children" as poor is because there was a mother with a very young daughter there and if I was in her position, I would not have enjoyed my time there

Finally made it to Ippudo and am very pleased that we did it, the place certainly lives up to the rave reviews listed here and on other sites. The restaurant is has a quirky design that you don't often see in Singapore and has a fresh, young feel to it. As with the other Ippudo restaurants, the staff are energetic and loud! How genuine it all is, I am not quite so sure...! Queuing for restaurants is the norm for many people in Singapore, it was a first for me and I can wholeheartedly (and somewhat surprisingly) say that it was worth it. Larger groups would likely face long wait times at this restaurant, I believe that there is also a separate room for groups looking to make reservations and I may well look into organising a quick team dinner here to try this out.The pork and prawn Ippudo buns, while small, were great (particularly the prawn).Gyoza were just nice, probably the least exciting dish that we tried.The Akamaru Chashu was cooked to perfection, as per the other reviews here, the broth was delicious, noodles (cooked to order) were full of flavour and it was also surprisingly filling. The spicy miso Tonkotsu was certainly spicy so that worked really well for us.So overall, very happy and will be returning, nice setting, great food and affordable prices
4
I went to Ippudo at Mandarin Gallery, for an early lunch, with such high expectations. The place was nice & service was good. Based on the recommendation (by the friendly waitstaff), I ordered the special Black Spicy Ramen with extra chashu. The broth was good, however, the spiciness masked the essence of the broth. The chashu was just average, not very exciting flavor-wise or texture-wise. Because I was on my own, I could only eat one bowl & missed out on tasting other offerings. Therefore, this review is only based on one dish
4
Love their Miso Tonkatsu! It is prepared so well. Great balance of flavours with the broth, pork belly and flavoured egg. Staff ask how you would like your ramen - soft, medium or hard, so perfect for fussy eaters. We also tried the spicy pork buns which were pretty good. Service is good. I agree with other reviews, one of the best places to have ramen.Recommend you try and visit out of peak times so you don't have to queue (still worth it if you do) as they don't take reservations
5
Having lived in Japan, I'm often sceptical about Japanese food in other countries, but Ippudo did not disappoint. We ate an early meal at 4pm (knowing about the queues and also being exhausted from the flight over) and the restaurant was quiet, and the service was excellent. I ordered the wanton-men and a glass of umeshu sprite, and was pleasantly surprised to see that you could choose how you wanted your ramen cooked (soft, medium or hard). I chose medium, although I think next time I would pick soft for a slightly more springy texture. The broth was lovely, not too salty but packed full of flavour, and the pork was flavoursome and not chewy. There were only 4 wantons in the bowl, but they were also quite tasty and each contained a small prawn. In my travel-weary state, this was heaven in a bowl! I would definitely eat here again and would highly recommend it as authentic ramen outside Japan

This restaurant's branch on Mohammad Sultan Road used to be called Ippudo Tao X (not sure what it means), and they used to serve the Tao Kuro noodles (kuro means black, I think). It uses a thick, curly noodles in its standard tonkotsu broth, with a slick of mayu (black-roasted garlic oil) to serve. I loved the chewy texture of the noodles, which paired really well with the heavy, liquefied pig they called broth. On my recent visit, however, the Tao Kuro has disappeared from the menu (cue distressed agony). In its place, a previously "special" ramen, the bonito tonkotsu (pork bone with bonito fish) ramen appeared. Don't get me wrong, the unctuous, full-flavored bonito tonkotsu more than made up for the regular tonkotsu broth in Tao Kuro. I only wish they'd retained the thick, curly noodles, though. They stand up better to the heavy, commanding broth. The thin, straight, Hakata-style ramen noodles are just too wimpy for the bonito tonkotsu, although it was perfectly cooked as ordered. The thin noodles just don't let the thick broth cling to it. Bring back the thick, curly noodles! Also, the yuzu kosho (fermented chili & Japanese lemon paste) served on the edge of the bowl was an excellent touch, it brightened up the broth. I just wish there was more of it, maybe served as tabletop condiments?I noticed there were several new additions to the menu, too, but I had no stomach space to try them all. The drinks menu has also been revamped, adding more choices of cocktails.Service is always great (except for the sour lemon-sucking-faced Filipina girl), and prompt
5
My favorite ramen place! Have not found any other ones better than them! Consistent quality everytime. I even visited their HK and SYDNEY outlets and they tasted as good! The only thing that I don't really like was they blasted loud music during my recent meal there. It was quite annoying as it was supposed to be a restaurant not a pub. They didn't have that music genre or volume until this year? I hope my next visit would have a quieter ambience for a nice hot ramen
4
Went for early dinner on a weekday; no waiting this time. Ordered our usuals, because we know the menu fairly well. The young man helping us needs to be trained in getting order right. I did not get warm water as I asked for; nor my daughter get iced water until asked again. He did not get our appetizer right. Asked for extra noodles towards the end (as you can order extra noodle for $2); he went and looked at the order sheet instead. We had to ask another waiter to get our noodles. Not a cheep eat place; but certainly the quality of the ramen will satisfy your craving
5
Yum Yum! Even our baby loved their ramen.
We noticed that everyone ordered their crispy corn, it piqued our curiousity and decided to try some. It is definitely something different and glad that we tried the unique dish.
4
The prices are quite similar to the Ippudo in NY.
I had the Miso Ramen. It was really yummy. And I also tasted the pork bun, terrific.
Our server was nice.
4
ramen tastes authentic. but i think the soup is pork based like most japanese ramen. big serving and service is very good. there's always a long queue.
4
I went to Ippudo for an early dinner around 5 or 6pm so there was no queue like other reviews suggest. I was seated immediately. I had wasabi shrimp and avocado salad which was good and one of their classic Ramens. The Ramen was tasty. Rich and flavorful broth, sliced pork, marinated egg. The pork was very fattyish and the egg I remember having had better before but the broth was very good. For dessert I had a fruit tartlet which was just ok.Altogether Ippudo is a nice place for Ramen in Singapore located very centrally. Worth a try
3
My friend & I decided to give it a try at this recommended ramen restaurant at Mandarin Gallery after work on Friday night. We started to queue at 7.30 pm and waited for around 45 minutes or more to get a seat. It is advisable to have some light foods before going there for lunch/dinner during peak period. The restaurant layout & design are nice & special. I ordered Akamaru Chashu. I love the texture of the pork belly, so soft and feel like melting in your mouth. The soup base flavour is very thick and nice, just it is a it too salty for me
5
IMO, this must be the best ramen I had in Singapore so far.They serve great pork broth and thin noodles (I love thin noodles) and I can choose the hardness of my noodles (I like it hard, not normal or soft)the queue is about 20-30mins so do buffer some time if you have other shopping/movie plans later on
5
First time to try it since we heard from it from a friend and it was pretty good we ended up eating there 3 times during the whole duration of our stay in Singapore. The crew of the establishment was very helpful especially if your trying it for the first time, they will give you awesome recommendations . So always ask what the specials are and you won't go wrong
4
Hi. 3 peeps went to eat at this place. The queue was long but move at an ok pace. Not a place to linger over your food as you can see there's a long queue outside.Ramen is ok, can chose whether yr noodles are soft, medium or hard. I prefer the modern soup based as the garlic flavor enhances the soup. The original soup seems ordinary.
1
I can't tell you about the quality of the food at this restaurant because I never made it to a table. We had heard that sometimes there were lines waiting to get in, but there was not last night. We were ushered in to stand a wait at the front of the house until a table was available. There were four other couples standing around the same table waiting for a seat. We were handed a menu and then that was it. No one came to see if we wanted anything to drink while waiting. In fact, we waited fifteen minutes and no one came over at all. At that point, we decided that it wasn't worth it for Ramen noodles and left the restaurant. What a shame that the service lost our business
2
I was really looking forward to having the "divine" ramen like the Ippudo I had in Japan. However, I left the place feeling disappointed. The taste was not even close to what I had in Japan ( Ebusu and Ginza branch). The soup was bland (we had shiromaru and akamaru) and the pork was anything but tender. The price was somewhat high compare to the quality of the ramen (15 SGD)
4
As usual the noodles are good with flavorful soup.
Love the side dishes like potato salad & the seasonal side dishes.
One of the better ramen outlets in Singapore .
4
Do expect long queue during the weekends and lunch/dinner hours. The soup is original and nice. The taste is unique as compared to other japanese restaurants. Taste it you know it. Overall, it was a good experience and i'm sure i will go back again.
5
it is easily the best ramen outside of japan. the queue is very very long during peak hours. so, go earlier than your usual meal time. atmosphere is jovial and casual. highly recommended
5
You could guess that this was something special. We were there on a Sunday and it opens at 11 am. By 1045 am, there were about 30 people waiting for it to open! We got in at 1105 am and got counter seats.The service was great despite the crowd. Efficient and friendly. At the counter, we were impressed as we watched the chefs expertly prepare the ramen with speed and dexterity.You get a choice how you like your ramen done - soft, medium or hard - so it's just the right consistency for your liking. But it's really the flavorsome soup that blows you away - aromatic with hints of garlic and fine minced meat. Top this with some freshly crushed sesame seeds that are available in the sauce dish on every table. This must rate as one of the best ramen joints. Service is prompt so our whole meal was done in 45 min. When we left at 1150am, there were some 20 people waiting in line!
5
Well, I am far from a ramen expert, but I certainly know japanese food and a good bowl of ramen when i come across it. And this place is bomb!! There is certainly a reason for the long ques. The tonkotsu ramen was on point. No complaints, up there is good ramen shops worldwide. I really love the appetizers here. The gyoza is fantastic. the cucumber is one of my favorites. new to the menu and quite delicious where the grilled corn, and sweet potato chips, both excellent. try off peak hours to avoid the que. we went on a saturday just before 12, no que at all
4
Lines here can be long. I arrived during off peak at around 2pm. They had a seasonal special called the Spicy black, basically their spicy noodles but with extra ground pepperIt was good, even as I was sweating eating it, I wanted another mouthfulThe gyoza was also good, skin was thin and pork was tastyJust a bit expensive, at around US$17 per bow
4
Usual peak hour queue takes 45 mins for a seat, but the queue is worth it, have queued many times and will be glad to queue again. I am picky about the noodles and at Ippudo, you can choose the hardness of your noodles from soft to hard, 4 levels for you to choose from. The soup base is also very rich and yummy.The service level has fallen a little but still A good meal which leaves me looking forward to my next visit
4
...But it'll do. U should try to come earlier to avoid the long line. I came in at 5:45 and was immediately seated, 20mins later they were having people standing in line already. A la carte menu was too standard and plain.. A little overpriced, even. Ramen almost as good as the one I've tried in Osaka itself. Place was a bit squeezy between tables, but decor was pretty cool
4
We paid $8 for avocado and wasabi mayo shrimps but it's simply disappointing as they used frozen vannamei shrimps and few pieces of avocado and leaves. Potato salad is bad as well. Not smooth and dry. Sausages are hard and dry. Probably sat in the fridge for hours.
4
by far the best ive tasted in Southeast Asia. the soup is so delish. the meat inside was just enough for one person consumption. not too plenty but not too few. gyoza was soso. I super love the ramen. I just find it quite pricey. Service is quite slow thoug
5
Wonderful chewy bouncy (choose medium texture) ramen available with various toppings and soup base. We tried thin miso soup, thick miso soup and one spicy ramen. All just as yummy!
4
High quality ramen in a very busy setting. Arrive by 11:30 or you will be queuing. Despite the quick pace, service is very good and the staff are very helpful with young children.
4
Great pork ramen I ever tasted. We ordered 4 bowl of different type of ramen and all has it authentic taste which all were delicious. No wonder there is a long waitng line for this delicious ramen.It was worth to wait.
4
Although not at par with the very best ramen in Japan or New York, it is quite good, probably among the best of the numerous ramen shops that have recently opened in Singapore. We tend to prefer the Ippudo Tao location at River Valley Road, as (a) the wait is shorter at peak hours, and (b) the menu is more extensive, for people who don't want ramen. The staff is very jovial and friendly, sometimes to the point of naivete (we were a party of 3, and the waitress asked "would you mind being split into 2 separate tables?!
5
This restaurant is buzzing.We actually came across it by chance,its located behind Mandarin Orchard and next door to Lawry's.Well ,there was a huge queue snaking along the corridor so we were curious and after seeing queues everyday we eventually managed to sneek in one lunchtime.I must say it was worth the wait.The food was delicious and I particularly liked the Avocado and Prawn salad with wasabi dressing...hot and luscious.We all had ramen too and it was goodness in a huge bowl!!Afterwards dont plan on eating again until the next day,its very filling.Looking forward to my next outing.Btw very kiddie friendly and spotless
4
We were so excited when ippudo opened in singapore. We have tried the same ramen shop in new york. Their ramen is delicious and very unique soup flavour. I have to say their ramen here in singapore is not as good as the one we tried in NY.Somehow the soup is a bit too thick and intense. Price wise is not that cheap for ramen. But it is worth to visit to try. And dont forget to add on the egg.
4
Get up earlier if you wanna have brunch, otherwise it will be late lunch.The queue always take time. It probably one of the most authentic ramen in Orchard, however it quite pricey for the serving size. The dessert I ordered was incredibly small, only 2 bites & its gone.Still good to try though
5
I ordered seasonal spicy black ramen, it was a new delicious experience to my taste bud! If you cannot tolerate too-spicy food, you can ask them to separate the spicy topping. My husband ordered another kind of ramen, I think it's Aka ramen(?), it was also as great. We also tried crispy corn, it was unique and surprisingly nice! We arrived @Ippudo around 5pm, it was not too crowded. But by 5.30 long queue already formed outside. So if you don't have much time, choose to eat outside peak hours
4
I do agree that Ippudo is one of the best ramen place in Singapore. Even you need to queue very long during lunch/dinner time, I still think its worthed :)The service was ok, looking at the queue, definitely people come here not because of the service :)I love their original ramen, the pork belly was really tasty and soup was excellent! ( I guess it because of the garlic oil ), the spicy ramen was so so, it taste like la mian ..and don't forget to order with Tamago!If you love ramen and not staying in Japan, this place is worth to visit! Haha
4
This is probably 1 of the top 5 ramen places in singapore, and explains the queue, even at 3pm for lunchtime. We ordered the ramen special with the works - comes with the egg and stewed pork on the side. The broth is indeed special and is apart from the other mundane shops littered all over the world. We also ordered the sides of gyoza and pork bun, which were average. The chinese still do the pork bun much better. This place is not cheap though, between the 2 of us it was $75 for a normal lunc
3
I'd shiromaru motoaji with nitamago, chashu and fresh garlic. The food was delicious but a bit on the pricey side.
4
There was a line at 3pm on a wed afternoon and we had to wait a good 20 mins. And they ran out of Ramen? Must be the way its cooked. We had the Pork bun and the Special combo together with the Shiro. The Chasyu Hot plate, something interesting. Will come again but might reconsider esp the waiting time
5
The long lines leading to this place give away that the patrons of this great ramen house are indeed loyal customers. No one waits in line for over 40 mins just for lackluster ramen. Try the miso base with the works accompanied by the Umeshu Cranberry drink. Very authentic. Not so cheap but absolutely mouthwatering! So worth the wait and the cost
5
Visited Ippudo many times, had even lost count of how many times I have returned. The ramen is fantastic, broth is exceptional. As i have returned many times, it has never disappointed me. It is a must try and probably the best in Singapore! Other than the signature ramen, side dishes are decent and recommended to try. After all, Karaka is still my favorite. Despite the long queues at busy dining hours, everything else is perfect. Probably its a sign of how tasty it is. Though it wouldn't affect me much as i like to go during the odd hours as its an all day dining restaurant. Highly recommended and will return again
4
Great noodle and soup! Resto is busy especially during lunch and dinner time. Try to avoid the long line by going at the off peak hours. But it is one of the must try ramen, so it's still worth the waiting. oh! and dont forget to try the pork bun too. so yummy !
4
This is a must try to ramen fanatics! The soup base, either miso or chosu is definitely mind blowing...it was so good, I had to go back here twice...any ramen on the menu is just as good as the next one so be adventurous and just point out what your heart desires
5
I love this place. It is the best ramen place I have tried so far in Singapore. Always have a long line up if you go at lunch time and also in the evening. The soup is very tasty and the noodles texture are just right. Anyway the noodles here are a bit pricey though
5
Just about the most delicious ramen I have had outside Japan: rich, creamy broth; perfectly thick noodles; delicious pork, all served efficiently by friendly staff in a tasteful, airy space (if not a little cold temperature-wise). I can't speak for the long lines that other reviewers complain about, both times I've been I managed to get a table immediately which makes this easy to recommend unreservedly. In addition to the ramen I also endeavor to get the small pork belly sandwiches. Only real draw-back is the price-perhaps not a surprise given the location. Still, worth it
5
I'm not a local and would normally travel to Singapore for business. Their ramen is the best in Singapore and the most expensive that I've tried because of the relatively small serving size. The broth is delicious especially the miso or the akamaru shinaji. The pork melts in the mouth and the tamago is cooked just right, not so soft and delicious.I would always go around 2pm right after checking in at this time there is no queue. This gives you more opportunity to focus on the food rather than complain about the effort of liing up
5
Ippudo has great Ramen, I tried two different varieties, the white bowl original Shiromaru Motoaji, and the red bowl Akamaru Shinaji. The Shiromaru was very good and tasted like traditional Ramen, not too heavy. The Akamaru was excellent and had a very strong flavor (mostly from the Garlic Oil), given the strong flavor, this was my preference though this is a heavier variety. Both were ordered with 'medium' noodles (they offer soft, medium, and hard) and I found that this was 'normal'.We also ordered the Gyoza, and although it was good, it was not great. I will likely try a different starter next time. For three bowls of ramen + two orders of Gyoza, the bill was $73 so this is on the pricier side for ramen.Make sure to go early or be prepared to wait 20-40 minutes in line
5
A family favorite, I frequently visit ippudo. The food is excellent and consistent. The service is quick and good. I highly encourage those looking for a good bowl of noodles to visit!
4
Tastes are really good and staff are friendly.

A friend of mine recommended me to visit this restaurant while I'm in Singapore. He swore it was the best Ramen he's ever had. I was a bit skeptical. But boy oh boy! He was RIGHT! It was absolutely THE BEST ramen I've ever had, BAR NONE! The sad thing is, they were planning to open an outlet in Sydney at the end of this year. END OF THIS YEAR! That's too long!! Even sadder still, they have no plan to open one up in Melbourne! DANG IT!It was quite a unique experience for me. Every time they deliver an order, everyone yell out something in Japanese. And then when a customer leaves the restaurant, everyone also yells out thanking the customer in Japanese. It was COOL!The only downside is they're a bit pricey, especially for Singaporean's standard

Omg... the soup! The pork is done well, the noodles and everything else are quite alright, but omg... the soup! Imagine the lovechild of "bak kut teh" and miso soup, born of sin. If you like your soups strong, this is it - garlicky, meaty, with a heaviness that can only come with hours of simmering stock. Delicious in a way only artery clogging food can be

Tonkatsu ramen was very delicious, noodles n the soup combination were perfect. The portion is big, so we decided to order 1 bowl of ramen and choose 2 light meals .. I order pork bun and korooke for light meals ( i forgot the name in the menu ), the portion was too small i think with that price,but the taste is so good..the service was very bad, waiters even a little bit rude.

Ippudo is the best ramen i've ever tried so far . They serve Hakata-styled ramen. I tried the original one and add additional tamago .. The soup was just perfect. The noodle was thin ,a bit curly and smooth,the Hakata-styled noodle. They provide free ice water here. We paid for 42S$ for 2 bowls of ramen. However ,this ramen shop is really worth to try ! And i think the must try in Singapore

The tonkotsu ramen was average at best. Its broth was disappointingly one-dimensional in flavor plus the overuse of ginger in the stock made the dish taste more Chinese than Japanese. The noodles were cooked to the requested texture but no big deal. The gyoza were small and flat in flavor. The only saving grace is the Japanese char-siew topping the ramen. They were packed with flavour and melt-in-your-mouth. For the prices they are charging, the media hype the brand garnered and the queues the restaurant draws, it was a big let down. No ramen grand master presiding in the show kitchen, just a bunch of young kids hustling out bowl after bowl of noodles, like a soulless factory. Spend your money at one of the smaller authentic Japanese ramen joints instead

I visited this restaurant with my brother at 14:30 . We were quite surprised to see a long queue in front of the restaurant since we had come after lunch. After 45 minutes in line, we finally get a table.I ordered shiromaru tamago ramen which is the original version of Fukuoka ramen, while my brother ordered the Akamaru tamago a fusion version of fukuoka ramen.Until the food arrived, we were waiting for nearly an hour and you know what? It really worth the time :) DELICIOUS!, The soup, the ramen and the egg, everything feels so good...if you visit singapore and have never eaten ramen Ippudo, you should come and try!tips:1. should come before lunch or after dinner time2. if you come in groups, since the queue is long enough, need only 1 person to queue.3. make sure to gather all members when you almost done the queue, since they will only provide a table according to the no of the people coming

First thing you'll notice around dinner time is the long queue to get into the restaurant, of course. We were there on a weekday for dinner. Organization of the queue is seriously inefficient. We thought that the island near the entrance was for people to chill while waiting once you get inside the restaurant (after queuing outside, mind you! - there's another queue INSIDE the restaurant -_-) but the waiting/queuing system leaves a lot to be desired. One particular staff member (should have gotten his name) didn't seem particularly happy with his job and was giving everyone a hostile attitude and face. So, you can tell that we didn't start off happy. Seriously, Ippudo, after all that I've heard about your restaurant, the least you can do is put a smiley happy staff member at the entrance! Ambience itself was ok, nice decor and furniture but music was being played too loud. Maybe it's just me but the music is completely unsuitable for a Japanese restaurant. And everybody was trying to speak at the top of their voices because they couldn't hear each other amidst the loud music. So, it sounded like a marketplace after a while. We ordered two ramen dishes and one rice dish. The unagi rice was surprisingly better than the ramen which is extremely average. It was a disappointment for me, as I honestly expected more after hearing about it. We also ordered the pork buns and the potato salad, both of which are nothing to shout about. Perhaps like some of the reviewers here, it's true when they say this place is too hyped up. They can't even beat the small, regular, generic ramen joints you find in Tokyo! Green tea is also non-refillable. So, that's a total rip-off, considering it costs as much as the glass of iced lemon tea. So, you might as well just order others, instead of the green tea! Now that I've finally had a taste of the food, seen the restaurant and experienced the service myself, I think I'll pass next time. Not worth the time you spent queuing outside (and in!) at all

Went to try (mandarin gallery) after hearing about their ramen. The queue was long, approximately 30 mins wait, but the ramen turn out to be "so-so", just very average. It doesn't have the "oomph" and has a forgettable taste. Perhaps the "chef" was off that day, but i would still think it is over-hyped. Not really worth the queue and waiting time

The ramen was awesome!
You can choose the doneness of the ramen and its perfect!

We went to this restaurant on a weeknight. I got there at 7.45PM on a Tuesday night, assuming it wouldnt be as busy as any Saturday night. How wrong was I! There were still a considerable queue.Having heard of the rave reviews about this ramen shop and never been there, we decided to wait. After approximately 30 minutes wait, we finally got a table. We were served by one of the Japanese servers (not a local Singaporean, judging from his accent). He suggested the Season's Special and what a suggestion!I had the spicy ramen with black fungus. It was so good, I finished every last drop of the broth in my bowl. I would rate the spiciness of the ramen 3/10 - there's only a faint aroma of chilli without the sting.We also ordered the gyoza and the potato salad, which were also to die for.All in all this is definitely a restaurant worth waiting for.My tips: 1. go a little late if possible. I notice by 8.30 the restaurant started to get a little quieter and gone is the long queue.2. Order the gyoza which has very smooth texture.3. I like the Calpis drink (Japanese soda) - worth a try

I went to ippudo hearing about it from my friends, when I reached there, thankfully there wasnt a queue. The staffs service there were so so, didn't go the extra mile. The ramen was a great disappointment, the soup was at first good but was super salty and after a few mouths, the taste got boring. I would not come back again and would rather go to the ramen place at ion. Whose price is affordable and tastes way bette

Visited this place during a rainy walk at Mandarin Gallery. It caught me off guard with its choice of simple and delicious Ramen. The Ramen is tasty, springy and soup base is simply superlicious. I'm not one to favour fat meats but I chose a tradiitional mix with fat meats (or char-siew in Singlish) and it made me curious. What can I say, no regrets, for once I understood why meat lovers and satay lovers love the 'fat meat'. Without the fat..it ain't that tasty no more.Great find, great taste, great price!! Go..go...go...for it. You've got to taste it to know what I mea

Decided to pay a visit to Ippudo Singapore, after visiting the original store in Hokkaido.Firstly the queue is pretty long, and sometimes it gets confusing.There's a table right in the front of the entrance, and the queue actually snakes in the other way round.Next after being ushered to our seats (we are sharing tables with other customers, due to the high number of customers on that day).In Japan, they serve you red tea together with whichever menu you are ordering. In Singapore, you have to order your drinks separately.The unique thing is the environment they create; in both Japan and Singapore, the purpose is to create a lively environment for diners to enjoy. Taste in Singapore was a little disappointing, maybe in terms of the authenticity, as well as the texture and feel. This was bearing in mind that the menu in Hokkaido is pretty much more limited, as compared with the Singapore menu.I still find it a little bit expensive, as compared with Hokkaido (and the wait of course)

I was introduced to Ippudo Ramen by a relative. Whilst I agree that the ramen was very nice and authentic, I found the ramen is on the high side on the price... even compared to the ramens in other cities like Tokyo or Sydney (where food are generally more expensive than Singapore).Service is quick and courteous, and it has a funky atmosphere because it has bowls and spoons on the walls, with black and red theme.To avoid the queue, you can come during off peak times (i.e. the time between lunch and dinner). Will I visit again next time in Singapore? Yes, but I might try their other dishes besides the pricey ramen

I went to Ippudo expecting some great amazing ramen but I was HUGELY let down. Everything in the ramen was awful. The texture of the noodles, the taste of the soup, the added "extra" bits. There was no umph in the ramen at all. I didn't finish more than a few mouthfuls of ramen and I was so disappointed and unsatisfied. I do not recommend Ippudo for ramen

I am a big fan of tonkotsu ramen, and Ippudo is good. Since it was a late night visit we actually went to the new branch IppudoxTao at UE square.We had the white (original) and black one and the soup was nice, however to me I still think Ichiran is better. The egg was beautiful and the pork slice was nice & tender. We did order a side of buta-kakuni but it wasnt worth it, too tough which shouldnt be the way...Beside ramen we also had the yakitori platter and OMG, the kawa (chicken skin) is definitely one of the best i had even comparing to some places in Japan. The pork bun was nice with a slice of melt-in-your-mouth pork and mayo

We thoroughly enjoyed our visit to Ippudo in the Mandarin Gallery. I had the akai and my wife had the shiroi ramen. We both agreed after tasting each other's ramen that the akai version was more rich in flavor. The soup was super. The ramen were cooked just right and the meat quite flavorful. It was so good that a few days later, my wife invited friends from Japan to have lunch. Go there early to avoid the crowd

Was walking past this outlet yesterday and remembered that its always a very long Q each time. Interestingly, the Q was not very long and therefore, decided to try out their Ramen.The waiter actually asked me how i want my noodles done, medium or hard. I asked for my noodle to be done medium. The soup base was very tasty and sweet. The texture of the noodle was good as well. Ordered the Gyoza too but found them pretty normal. But i would say, their Ramen is one of the best i had tried in Singapore. The ambience of the restaurant is that of a typical ramen outlet where they would have the open kitchen. Price wise, i would say its just right
