I bought a caramel and chocolate pie from here and it was heavenly. The perfect blend of sweetness and not too bitter. It legit melted in your mouth. So good!
5
Pretty good!
Highly recommended chocolate macaroons!
Staffs are really nice and helpful.
Open until 11:00pm so that is a plus point!

Just got home and was checking my credit card statement to find I overpaid for a coffee and baguette and danish by about £80. Be carefull
5
lots of original sandwich fillings and cakes to chose from. all good though may be not truly french but with a french theme

I tried the Cold Brew Honey Latte after due consideration that I was so sleepy and need some caffeine to wake me up. It looked simple but I had to admitted their coffee was better than I was expected. I also had a small strawberry shortcake. Their cake now not so sweet and good combination with unsweetened coffee. The place was very crowded and as normal the service was below average. The tables were not cleaned up after the customers left and need to call the waiter.

Always enjoyed the food in PB. Always a great place to stop and have a quick bite of for tea time to hv beautiful cakes. But recently we were served by the worst kinda attitude by a young lady called GIGI who was basically acting like she was forced to serve us and throwing selections from the salad bar into our bowl. Not only that right in front of us she was picking out our protein looking for the worst possible chunk that look so soggy and disgusting to put on our bowl. I had to stop her and ask her to change. Also the girls before us who ordered salad sizes smaller than we had, she placed more portions. What is this? The attitude of hers was the most surprising. Ps: GIGI you got to learn how to smile, have basic mannerism and be nice to people.

Good food and wide range of options available. Service is lacking but I would still rate it as a 4 because it was extremely busy and staff did respond when prompted.We had brunch and had a tuna tartar croissant and caprese grilled cheese toastie. Both tasted nice and light. Food can go cold quickly as you line up in a queue and when its v busy, its hard to find seating. Cafe latte served was nice. We got full cutlery and crockery. You have to tell them when you order that you will be eating in when they ask you otherwise they wont give you a plate (as with most cafes i guess in the uk too)

We come here for Sweet time for tea promo 3-6 pm. Set for tea for 2 at s$30. We were attracted by its name and beautiful cakes. Cakes could be good. However, the staff who attended to us were no doubt had never received any training in providing customer service before. We were served without plates, creamer and spoons. When asked for it, we were given the reluctant look. Other staff also never work with a smile. They totally neglected why people coming here just to have a happy high tea gathering and not to see their sulky faces. Bad bad bad

well, I v e been waiting for few weeks before leaving a comment ... I'm working in this mall and I was going there quiet often ... the food is good but unfortunately the staffing is not efficient ... the lady manager should start to teach the basics to the staff ... like being polite .. saying Hi, thank you, please ... and why is it so long to order ... ? specially when you have so many staff ... in Fnb Time is money !! and why promoting a frappe if you never able to please your costumers ? 4 times I asked 4 times they couldn't do it ... it s not that cheap, quality and choice is ok but for a better experience you better improve ur service ... go upstairs to Starbucks and takes notes ... they are super friendly and quiet professional .

We had afternoon here twice on a previous visit to Singapore in 2013 as we enjoyed it so much. This time the cakes looked just as lovely, but it was disappointing to find that they were mostly made of cream inside. It is a crowded little place, so the tables are very close together (a little too close - hard to navigate around them) and staff are slow to clear empty tables
3
Cakes and pastries are ok.
Service is ok.
Space and table seating are too close and uncomfortable. Clearing of tables also slow.
3
Food was delicious and yummy. Service was only soon soon acceptable. Not much to complaint because was hungry.

This review will be in Wisma Atria Orchard.I was having breakfast here at least 3x a month or more with friends and sometimes alone. Food is good. I tried mostly for their bfast, sandwiches, cakes and pastries and of course their healthy salad! But one thing this place is missing very importantly... your staffs. It doesn't need to be smiling always but here we go! Early in the morning, starting my day seeing a staff frowning at most! Not just today but everytime we visit. Did we do something wrong??? We were just a customers wanted to have a good breakfast and fuel ourselves for the busy day coming to us. Isn't these staffs taught how to be in F&B industry? So sad... its good to have staffs to be well trained... Please please we want you guys to accomodating for everybody... Thank you. Cheers

we came across this outlet by chance and wanted to try their macaroons. we quite liked the chocolate and pistachio macaroons we sampled and decided to try a little bit more. we (two of us) ended up devouring 6 macaroons and a mirror glazed cake! the cake was the best part :-
1
This review is for the Changi Airport outlet, but since I can't seem to find that listed on TripAdvisor, I'm submitting the review here. I came here after checking in for my holiday. I thought I would treat myself to a bit of a luxe breakfast before flying off. The selection on display did look inviting, though rather limited. This, I could attribute to the size of the outlet being rather small. I made my selection, Scrambled egg, ham & cheese croissant, and proceeded to the cake to select my drink and pay. Apparently, they didn't have coffee because the espresso machine was down. I was appalled when I saw the tea selection. Prices started from $7 for a cup, just a cup of tea, mind you, to $9 for a pot of other "classic" teas. I've eaten at some really expensive restaurants, and even they don't charge $7 for a pot of tea! I ordered a milk tea, and when I got it, it wasn't even hot. Barely tepid, if I'm honest. The croissant I ordered was so-so. I asked for it to be warmed, but by the time I ate it, it wasn't. Not really the staff's fault, but it just added to the disappointment. The inclusion of mustard aioli (I'm imagining it's hand-made aioli and not store-bought mayonnaise) was a bit of a surprise, though not unwelcome to me. It put some flavour into an otherwise unremarkable sandwich. Other folks may not necessarily enjoy that flavour, though... Overall, highly disappointing for the price I paid. If this is a consistent standard, I don't know how they've stayed in business for so long...
5
While I would not go there for dinner, at any other time it is excellent. The food is freshly made, beautifully presented and packed if you happen to carry it out. The prices, while not cheap, are reasonable for being in Singapore. The almond pastry and the tiramisu bread definitely worth a try. But everything is high quality. Great concep
4
I have been patronising this outlet for countless times. Maybe is the food or maybe is the pretty korean, muslim or chinese gals there.......Anyway, I love the sandwiches there like the wasabi and chicken mayo sandwiches. It may sound ordinary but it works for me. It starts at $8 and my wife says it is pricey. But everytime I buy for her, she wallop it in no time. The other favourite is the tuna focaccia which i pair it with another favorite sausage ham salad in honey mustard dressing. Get it with a clam chowder soup and you have a great meal. Many of the sandwiches are popular and sold out by evening. Wait...I have more favorites.........the soya sauce breaded chicken sandwich is wonderful..is something of korean fried chicken wrapped in hot dog bun. I also like the Wakeup Jane...is a pizza like bread top with sausage, egg, tomatoes with melted cheese. More....then there is this chocolate peanut butter croissant wrapped in banana...the mix is sinfully sweet heaven for me. Must try. .There is no waitress...u just order and find a seat. The food are considered pricey and so are the drinks. Still, is a good place to relax after a day of shopping or taking a break from shopping. This is one of my favorite palace at wisma,,, so do try it out
2
The service is great but the food quality can be better: the bread was stale and $9 for a pot of tea with one tea bag! The presentation of the food is good. Get very busy during lunch time with the locals after a touch of pseudo-Frenc

I've always loved Paris Baguette everywhere I go. The coffee is always amazing, the food is freshly made and the staff and managers there are relatively friendly. 3* because a few times now, I saw them throwing all of the leftovers. There are so many people dying from hunger so we should not throw food. There are a few departments from NEA that collects leftovers and gives it away to the needy. I do hope this really nice cafe can be kindhearted and give to the less fortunate rather than throw
1
Arrived at airport terminal 2 at about 10pm on 8/5/17... food looks yummy so wanted to try, was served by a Chinese lady with zero smile.. when I told her to heat up the bread she didn't even reply.. her face was so black like someone force her to work.. she really spoil my day really!!! oh cmon she is a service staff plus working at the airport. A smile is just a basic rite? Food is yummy!!!
3
The sponge was largely dry and the mangos weren't sweet. Quite hard to swallow after a few bites cause the sponge was dry
5
We ordered salads; they were fresh and very tasty. Excellent choice of cakes! The fresh juices in the rather attractive tall bottles was really good. Try the grapefruit. Service was efficient and the location is ideal. The value was excellent. Only SGD20.
5
Really love the fresh juice (grapefruit & kiwi). Loved the croissant bread also, so crunchy..my sister said the cafe mocha was really great (the best that she had ever tasted). Will come back here again..
5
Everything in the cafe is delicious. The salad, the sandwich and especially the cake. Many choices are available. The coffee tastes good too.
4
Of course stuff in Singapore can be expensive...it's Singapore...and this place can be pricey, but you don't have to buy anything (if you can resist). Cakes and slices of all shapes, sizes and flavours. As well as open 'toasts' - which we tried the mushroom and the seafood ones....as well as for dessert - the pastry wrapped banana covered in chocolate! And very tasty
3
Espresso shots are 5 bucks each. I had a double and that set me back 10 bucks. The coffee was ordinary and very expensive.I had a nice chicken wrap. Which was very delicious with lean meat and veggies in it. Worth the 7 bucks.Would revisit but not for the beverage
5
Whenever go to Singapore I visiting friend and today I met a Singaporean whose live here more than 10 years. She came with her son, and me with my wife, son and mother in law. So it was 6 people including two kids. Is it friends hangout or family hangout, or both? We ordered 4 portion salad and 3 sandwiches. All are different recipe and ao we can share a little bit. Two drinks was coffee, one hot cappucino and one with ice. Plain water was free and you can take it by yourself on the desk. But just after meal arrive we cannot decide to share because eating intentionally Meals was still left one sandwich because our stomach is full. So I keep it take away. Then we ordered two mini chocolate cake as a dessert. The taste very good too. It is a lunch friend-date since so many worker eat there too, and their discussing something seriously but their gesture look happy and relaxing. Not to noisy place and bright to chat. I'm happy as my friend and my family. I definitely would back there whenever meet other friend next time.
4
Visited this branch on a weekday at around 1pm. There was a short queue but we were served quickly.I ordered a Velvet Cream Earl Grey Hot Chocolate and my colleagues and I shared their new Strawberry Choux and square strawberry shortcake.Love the drink! Very very yummy. The pastries were pretty decent as well. A good experience
3
I was thinking what's the big hu-ha about it. I remembered I tried one of their dessert before and it was really nice. But after then, I couldn't seem to have it every time I was there. Nice ambience but I think the dessert and drinks are ok only. I have yet to try their sandwiches etc. hence I can only commend on dessert and drinks.
5
I had a solo lunch here on Friday and then on Saturday I brought my son, his wife and my four year old granddaughter for brunch.It's sensible to try and arrive before peak times as they become extremely busy and limited seating.By any standards this is a terrific cafe, something appealing for every taste, delicious mixed salads, amazing baguettes, pastries and a complete range of enticing food.Service is good and food to die for
5
The food there was value for money and delicious. Good overall ambience. Do try the seafood and mushroom chowder.
1
When you just want a nice cuppa coffee and an apple pie DONT go here ! Everything is cold and service leaves nothing to want to come back to ..
4
Visited the outlet at Raffles Place for lunch. Other than the nice and tasty cakes and bread, am surprised that the club sandwich and omelette mushroom tasted good too.
4
They have a huge variety of yummie pastries and dessert. Delicious pastries. Love everything that we ate. One of the best i've ever had.
4
Very nice and good pastries. However prices are pricey. This outlet has more varieties than the one at JEM. However environment so so and sometimes the floor is quite dirty. Lack of cleaning/clearing manpower.
2
I was visited this cafe last year, the attitude of the employee is really worst and impolite. It seems that no customers or buyers on their eyes..
5
This place is beyond expectation and very sceptically I requested for Orange n Kiwi juice and Herb Chicken..Wow this was unexpectedly yummy..I am sure rest of the menu must be as delicious too..A must visit place...
5
Cosy ambience, with plenty of dessert choices! From muffins, puddings, buns, croissants, doughnuts, and more... This is P&G is such a nice place to hangout for family and friends on a casual tea break. The bottled yogurt drink is also unique and yummy. Will be back for sure
4
Love the great varieties of bread and pastry available for breakfast in the morning. This place was already half packed when we arrived at 10am. I'll strongly recommend the Milk Tea Latte. They do serve water free of charge. You can go for their brunch set or choose from their large varieties of bread. We chose their Seafood Chowder, cheese tart, Oriental Clozone and Soy Chicken Sandwich.
3
Went to this place ,instead of going for high tea in hotel lobby. I went there this afternoon, but very very crowded because of long queue..I went to this place again , the place not crowded as not many people come here for dinner.I was impressed with wide array of cake and sandwiches. buns, ..I chose ham and cheese sandwich and square - squared shaped strawberry short cake. I asked for espresso machiatto with whipped cream.The staff replied '' don't have whipped cream..'I thus chose mocha coffee.Total , less than $25. for a cake , sandwiches and cafe mocha
5
I visited this place at Bugis while I was on a holiday in Singapore. The Sweet Bacon Roll was to die for! All the pastries were perfectly decorated and looked beautiful!
4
Love their carmebet cheese cake. It was so luxurious and one of the best cakes out there. I didn't appreciate the ambiance much but cake was mind blowing.
Makes for a great tea time
4
Tried their Alsace salad, mushroom foccassia and seafood chowder soup in a bowl. Reasonably priced and the 6 mushroom foccassia was delicious. Service staff at counter were friendly and efficient. Good location
4
First time visited this French style dessert and bakery at Wisma Atria. Price is reasonable for being here in Singapore, Taste of the bakery are all good that we can feel energy sip of their ingredients. Surprisingly knowing later that the shops are Korean owned brand ( Paris Croissant ) as everything look European styled both decoration and bakery taste
3
We visited the outlet at Bugis Junction. Seems to be run by young girls who are very busy talking to each other. We had to ask three times for the plates and glasses from the previous customer to be removed off our table and then had to ask for the table to be wiped clean. We almost left. The food however was good and we enjoyed it all but for the tea which was very weak and certainly not worth $9!
4
My seafood foccacia was super tasty. Right amount of squid shrimps and cheese. The crispy garlic chicken sandwich was so so. My wife's chicken salad croissant was very good too. I will definitely try the salads that were there. Was just a walking distance to our hotel and so was a perfect place for brunch
4
Never gets tired looking at the amazingly beautiful pastries & cakes here. Came here for coffee after lunch, both for the cosy, nice ambience & to admire the amazing pastries & cakes. However take note that prices here are on the high side. Right across this main cafe is a small separate section (shop), where one can observe how these pastries & cakes are being made. Interesting
1
Parents, read this review. Just been here with my 2y old. Ordered 2 coffees and 2 BLTs. As parents should know how hard it is to entertain a toddler, well we got put coffee and waited for 30min to get our food while our son was jumping all over us. Asked twice about the food, they told me please sit down we will bring it. After 45min I started to ask around more, seems they FORGOT about our BLTs. Needless to say we left the place without eating, at least they accepted to offer the refund.Great coffee, great baby chairs, but awfull service, will make sure never to come back, as we just ended up eating junk food while walking back home because we wasted 1h of our time.Bo
5
We'd already had a late breakfast at a nearby food court and were looking for something sweet. Our friends knew of a bakery tucked inside one of the upmarket shopping malls. The displays of cakes and pastries looked amazing whilst in another part of the shop we could see the staff finishing off many of their creations with whipped cream and fruit.We ordered a strawberry bomb looking whipped cream creation and another with 4 spoons. The flavour and quality was first class and considering we shared 2 items between 4 people it wasn't too expensive. Mrs Vicar said it was one if the best patisseries she'd ever eaten. We all agreed that we probably couldn't eat a whole one each. Afterwards we looked at some watches we could never afford in an adjacent shop
5
I ate their sandwich last time.. taste really good but from all of their menu, i love their royal pudding (original) so much. If u never try it, it's good for u to taste it once for all.A lot of pudding maker who follow selling the pudding, but i am not finding any of them can deliver as tasty as Paris Baguette until today
5
Nice food nice service, startegic place which in Wisma Atria Orchard. Their croissant must try, also their salad
4
Simply love their thai noodles salad. This korean store serves very good cakes, pastries, etc. Good to have afternoon tea with a piece of yummy cakes.
5
The display of cakes, baguettes and fresh salads looked delicious. I had a yummy sponge angel cake. Recommend this place for lunch, morning or afternoon tea.
4
Tried for the 1st time.
Cakes look very nice. Taste good too! Better than Lady M.
Price is at the high side.
4
Wonderful afternoon tea at Paris Baguette. We also took seafood cowder soup and salad. Perfect after shopping. Mojito drink and milk tea are also refreshing.
5
I was super looking forward to have my favorite camembert cheesecake with my friend but instead they upgraded it to something better. I'm so loving the Snowball Camembert Cheesecake with Strawberries.
4
We stopped here a cake and tea and were not disappointed the tea was refreshing and the cake was very jummy. if you need a break stop here.
4
We went to the cafe at Bugis Junction. Very good pastries. Very small store with seating right in the middle of the passage way in the mall. But the food is great!
3
This place is always busy, especially during weekend, been here for few times and actually I reluctant back to this place again, because I dont feel have a wow factor or wow memory , but due to my overseas guest hasnt try this cafe, I try it again. Cake and pastry was great, i love it Coffee was expensive, if we compare between price and size, a small cup of latte cost $6, and I dont enjoy the shape of the mug, it will better serve in proper mug size , or a proper Italian cafe late glass Staff members ( Korean and Filipino ) was lacking of smile, no welcome to customer, compare to the real Korean in KoreaAfter making a payment, no courtesy to say thank you, instead of my self thank them and also no reply or respond from the cashierSound the services like I purchase 90cents kopi at hawker centre, serve by grumpy old uncle :)
5
Been here couple of times now and going AGAIN for sure!!The atmosphere, the Service, the Food, the Sandwiches, the Salads, the Baguettes, the Cakes, the Juices made of fresh fruits! It has it all, we loved this place!Friendly staff and the smell of fresh bread.. Loving it!You can buy things to go with you too. Great concept
4
This is a lovely French cafe for afternoon tea. The sandwiches and cakes were delightful. The decor is comfortable and clean. A nice cafe to enjoy a break from shopping in.
4
Many choices of sandwich, and they're all taste good. The coffee is also nice. It's packed with people most of the time, so you have to wait in line to have a seat.
4
This outlet is located at the ground floor wisma atria (between nge ann city and ion orchard). Their cake are wonderfully presented. I like their cheese cake and maccaroon. Next time we'll try other cakes. Their croissant and mushroom cake are also delicious.
4
Simply love their cake. Usually, I will come here with my friend for a drink and cake to chit chat.
The cake is very spongy and delicious. Must try!
4
Good lunch but not very special. Taste waa okay. The dessert was delicious. For what you pay for I'd expected more.
4
never enough of their milk pudding and the presentation attracts all ages of consumers! te macoron is great and must try! !
4
nothing much to say, its well done, well layout, well organized
love the pudding, and the cow picture in the packaging :D
3
It is a nice place to chill. You do get to order your food from the counter. Sandwiches and wraps taste average for the price that they are going for. Great for a quick bite or some food to fill your tummy if you need something to eat without feeling too full
4
This is a nice, bright, colourful & luxurious, classy looking cafe. The pastry, cakes , sandwiches, etc all looked just as colourful & "delicious." All looked so tempting & beautiful.The premise is quite big with huge varieties to match. The place was pretty crowded & seems very popular, although prices are not exactly cheap.All said, food is not bad & this is a nice cafe to sit in for your cup of coffee or snacks after much walking in Orchard Road
3
We were tired of walking and in need of a good coffee. Since we wanted to avoid Starbucks and Coffee Bean and there wasn't any other choice left, we decided to try this out. The pastries are Japanese 'French' style. I had a cherry danish. Edible but not really how it should be. Had a very expensive Espresso Macchiato for $6. Waited more than 30 min and it still didn't come. After complaining, they made it. It was good but not worth $6. Despite the prices, there are customers so what can I say. But I won't be having coffee and cake there again
4
My kids love the pudding very much ! Sadly not all pudding flavours are consumable for Muslims as told by the staff only the original is fine, rest of flavours are not ok. Very friendly staffs for the useful information.
4
Best pudding that i ever had !
The taste so milky
I like original flavour
Located in the orchard [@wisma]
But a little expensive
5
First tried this in Korea in 2010 and I am glad it has opened in Singapore now. For those who like some creativity in their desserts or cakes, you have reached the destination.This cafe serves us the treat and gives us a cozy ambience. Great to go there with your friends or simply spend a good reading time with our iPad or the old fashioned way if reading a book
4
This korean owned store serves very good cakes, pastries, etc.We must stop by every time we come to the Wisma Atria mall in orchard road. The queue is long cos you have to stand in line to buy your food and drinks. So sometimes if you just need a cup of coffee, you still have to stand in line and wait for others ordering pastries. This we find inefficient.There are many staff, some Chinese china, some Koreans, etc. They may be just students cos we overheard them speaking Korean language. Now that K pop is hot here, people want to try Korean food. We buy the mango cake here whenever there is a birthday celebration. It is expensive, almost $50 but taste good and not too much as it is light and with fruits so healthier we hope.... looks may be deceiving!It has seats so you can rest here after shopping. As it is self service, it can be a chore. What to do... if you want to try, you have to queue... smile.We try to go only when it is not crowded. There is one at bugis mall less crowded but smaller in size and variety.Competition in this pastry industry is very strong. Good for consumer

I am referring to the branch in Changi Airport Terminal 2 besides the arrival hall. I happened to eat my lunch there on Sept 16, while waiting to pick up my husband. I picked their Oriental Chicken salad, which was quite large in portion, and rather filling. The grilled chicken tasted good, the hard boiled eggs were just right; and there were a lot of vegetables which suited my palates a lot as I am a vegetables person. The strange combination is the Japanese edamame beans. However, overall, with the seasame sauce that came with it, it was just a good combination. I also had a cup of hot chocolate after that. What I would have to say is that it was rather pricey, as it was just a regular cup and cost $8. The good thing is that unlike other restaurants, they did have a small gap in which a small straw could be put in for drinking, so we do not have to worry about burning our hands, and opening the cup to drink. The only trouble I had is that probably condensed milk was added to the hot chocolate, which caused me to have tummy cramping after drinking it, which lasted for a day or so. Anyway, still a great restaurant. The seating environment is rather cosy, quiet and large too. May consider going back to try their other types of salad in the near future, when I have the chance to do so
4
Call me a Tiramisu fiend if u like but I am a sucker for a good dessert any day (or night!). We just happened to stumble upon this Paris Baguette Cafe at Wisma Atria on Orchard road a few weeks ago. And I've already been there about twice a week for the past 5 weeks! They are open till about 10pm and you always get a seat available for two rather easily unless its a super busy friday or sat evening. The hubby loves the macaroons from here so whenever we walk out of Paris Baguette we seem to be a happy duo walking out after a doze of sugar indulgence. If you want to burn off the calories, feel free to walk back home if live close by or walk down Orchard Road for an evening stroll and watch the busy residents n tourists getting by. Enjoy your time in Singapore :-
2
I am totally not impressed by the quality of cakes and the high prices. Drawn by the crowd and the pretty display on the selection, it was utter disappointment when I tasted the Tiramisu, chocolate cake and the cherry cake. The coffee is nice. A glass of orange juice cost $9. Will not be going back ever again and certainly not be recommending this place to anyone. For much better cakes, I would rather visit Laman's Delight instead : http://www.pasarbella.com/retailer/lamans-delight
5
we could only find one of these in Singapore, Wisma building on Orchard Rd, opposite Paragon.the cafÃ© come highly recommended, the treats were to die for, beautiful presentation and great variety of food, lovely plush chairs, why are there not more of these instead of Starbucks on every corner, this place has class.The coffee as great and coffee is not always great in Singapore.
5
Not knowing that Paris Baguette chain is a franchise from Korea, I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food here.Lovely pastries, lovely cakes and most yummy their Milk Pudding. Served in individual mini bottles with caramel at the bottom, it was a delightful!Will be coming back again
5
If you are a sweet pastry lover, this is the place to be. Service is nothing much but the food is to die for. The chocolate cake with strawberries were out-of this world. The coffe is really nice, but in my opinion the pricing is a bit too high. Overall a nice little place to stop by during a evening stroll for tea or coffe. But if you stop there trust me you are going to spoil your dinner. You can't stop eating. Cheers
3
Nice apple pie and blueberry Danish. Had them take away. Waitress/cashier could be more cheerful, they seem very grumpy/unhappy to serve.
4
i first tried this bakery is when i visited Seoul last year,, i remembered the bread is so yummy,,, and when i saw the bakery on Singapore i'm super exciting to eat there,,
4
The food was nice. The breads and salad was nice. But their specialty is the most famous pudding, The Royal Pudding. The pudding was so soft and delicate. Little bit pricey for a pudding but the taste will never lie about the price.
4
Close to authentic French bread and goodies!
Must check out when you're in Singapore. We always get our fill from the Terminal 2 arrival area :)
1
I do like their chicken wrap and will buy at least 3 rolls per week to stock up. However, patronizing them is a drag because of the bad customer service. The outlet has been around for a long time but service hasn't improved much. I really hope they can brush up on that. It could be because the staff at the counter are well trained thus giving the company a bad reputation. And looking through the reviews on the web, poor services is not uncommon and i really wonder why the management hasn't picked it up yet 
2
It's amazing the number of reviews that touches on poor service given the not too many total number of reviews here. I think we could very safely conclude that the owner or management did not read the review here.I visited the branch in One Raffles place on a Saturday. Quiet as I was early. Took them more than 15 mins to deliver my food though I'm the only one waiting for cooked food.The service was bad right from the beginning. The manager/supervisor (should be as he was in different uniform) was not interested when collecting payment from me. No eye contact and all along talking to his co-worker the whole process.No apologises or explanation why the food took so long, while all the while walking past my table and , of course, talking among themselves.When I was finally served, he just basically placed the food in front of me. I was so indignant that I did not bother with a 'Thank you' for him, which I never fail to do it. The cheese egg benedict tasted quite good and the royal mango pudding was good too, albeit, pricey.So why did I bother to write a review on something that has been mentioned? Because I have been to places which served similar food and I thought are more welcoming than this place. Brunch, eggs lovers, go check them out instead
2
I have eaten at the Wisma Atria and Changi Airport outlets and the staff service is one of the worst I have ever encountered. Instead of following, they allowed customers to jump queue. The way they attended to you was like you owed them a living. When I asked to pack my food to avoid wastage, the staff just out it in the paper wrapper without giving me a carrier. Food-wise, some are good while others are bad and even over-priced
5
This Korean bakery chain has done such a superb marketing/packaging job that there is practically no hint of its parentage. You might only chance upon a Kimchi salad or bun but by and large it's neither Parisian in origin or carries mainly authentic French breads. What you get are a handful of French bread and pastries and mostly Asian influenced bread with savoury fillings. The salads are delicious and generous in portion and don't miss the creamy puddings PB is famous for. The cakes are gorgeous and very Japanese style though still some way to go from the premium and I dare say best confectioners in Asia from Japan.By and large a choice place to pick up a sandwich, salad and pudding next time you are at the T2 Airport in Singapore.
4
Been to PB many times over the years, I have no complains on the quality of the food at all, whether you're ordering cakes, breads, breakfast, coffee, juices etc. Everything tastes good!The only complain I have for this place, will be the price. It's not cheap, so it's not a place I'd eat once a month of so
1
My friend and I went to Paris Baguette @ Jem for the first time. At first I did not notice it but the service was without smile for a start. I was asked what my order was. So I ordered a traditional breakfast and a pancake. I was told "pancake no ice cream ah!" (I didn't understand at first but then pretty quickly, I realized what she meant because the picture and description on the menu is "pancake with fruits and ice cream") so I said ok but continued with "So, is it replaced with anything?" Answer was a simple, nonchalant "No." And she continued punching her cashier till. I turned around and asked my friend if she would like coffee and she declined so I turned to cashier "Then some water please." She didn't say anything, just told me my bill came up to $29 ($14 for the traditional breakfast with sausage and eggs and $15 for 2 pieces of pancakes with cut fruits). I passed her my card. "Visa?" I answered affirmatively and silence follows. I went to my table, waited for the food to arrive. It came. The traditional breakfast was served with chili sauce, so my friend immediately asked for ketchup. A very curt and prompt reply "We don't serve ketchup." And he walked away. We were puzzled. Then I got up to look for water. I asked another waiter nearby where I could get some water. While not even looking up or addressing me, he said "we don't serve water" and went into the kitchen!! Unbelievable!!By this time, you might have guessed, we have decided we are not spending another cent in this place! So we didn't buy the mineral water. As we were eating, another waiter walked past so I asked if there's any particular reason why the cafe served chilli sauce but not tomato sauce. Of all those we met earlier, this tall young man was polite enough to say "Uhh, I don't know. Would you like me to ask why?" I said "Yes, please."He went to the counter, spoke to his supervisor (slight different uniform) and then... He went about doing his own things!! Actually I kept my eyes on him and his supervisor. When he went back to work, I thought the supervisor might come and talk to me. Nothing like that's happened. In fact, she avoided my eyes! After a long while (of course my discontent at the rudeness and lack of service skills in the manager had gone up about 20 times!), the tall young man came back and said the reason was because the kitchen doesn't use tomato sauce, so they don't serve that. And with that, he quickly went away. Unbelievable!!Anyway, my friend at this point told me that she used to patronize their orchard road store but after they opened a few more outlets, she had stopped because of poor service as well. Well, it's decided then! I'm not gonna spend money and be treated in this manner. NO THANKS! Honestly, this is not the first nor the last eatery that I go to or have been to that does not serve water or ketchup or whatever. But what truly sucks is the POOR ATTITUDE from manager all the way down to staff. Yucks!

The array of food choices was amazing and the food was just delicious. Although it was very confusing on how you actually order. But besides this, we were very happy with the experience

OK place and the location and is very good
not so pricy . we will come back soon when we are in Singapore again
Cheers

They make a good coffee here. Croissants not very impressed. Nice display and comfy chairs. This place was super busy during lunch time
4
I have not tried their meals, but only the pastries, and their pastries are good. They not only look good, but they taste good too. However, their drinks are overpriced and can be much improved.
4
it doesnot offer heavy meal,but what they offer are good enough,beside their alrdy popular pastries and the on stage kitchen gives the dynamic atmosphere to the experience

Have been here on numerous visits. The pastries don't disappoint but staff and coffee not so good. We got our pastries and waited for ages while the staff were setting up stock on their morning tasks. Not good when the customer should come first! The cashier was young and very unfriendly. She was too busy texting on her mobile phone to serve ! I think $9 for a pot of tea is very expensive and when you don't get served efficiently when there are more staff than patrons - not good. The Manager was there as well so no excuse for bad service. I have spent 20 years in hospitality and maybe I'm different but sorry I cannot tolerate staff having access to their mobiles at work!

The cafe itself is decorated beautifully, the ambiance is pretty good for good morning coffee or lunch/dinner time. The food is average. I had the salad and the sandwich. The coffee was really good. The service was really nice as well. The lady cleaned up the table very fast so not a lot of people hanging around looking for empty table.

My brother told me about this Royal Pudding.. So i come here with my father after dinner time around 9pm. We order the Royal Pudding original flavour and mango latte. Both are delicious. But IMO a bit pricy. I might come back again if got the chance

Because I cannot take the too busy food court at Takashiyama, I had to look for a more peaceful place to eat. I am visiting SG and the daily hustle and bustle of the city is not always welcome, so I had to look for a place to eat.I got my peace and quiet at Paris Baguette, I ordered the cheese omellette which was SGD$ 18, pricey, but yummy. you want this sort of place to eat and relax after all that walking and shopping along Orchard
3
Happened to chance upon the new outlet at the basement of One Raffles Place. Very crowded as it is located at the CBD area, thus decided to take-away.
Wide selection of bread and pastries. Nice bread but a little pricey.
4
pastries are delicious together with their coffees. nice hangout after shopping a nd good location as well as it was in the middle of the mall.
4
Made an impromptu decision to visit after dinner on Friday as my girlfriend & I were craving for dessert. She loved the royal pudding! Unfortunately, the Mango & Earl Grey cake weren't so good. The sponge turned out to be really dry & crumbly. I might visit again when we run out of dessert places
4
This cute cafe is always busy and has a range of different fancy cakes and also lovely little puddings in cute glass jars.Overall the quality of the food is good and the price is fair, given its in the expensive orchard road.They also have a light meal menu (sandwiches and salads) although i am yet to try these.Do drop by if you are on your way to ION mall or Wisma itself

I've been trying Paris Baguette a couple of times and I always order the Royal Pudding. Last time I tried to order their Seafood Chowder and mushroom bread. I have to say that both were mediocre in taste. The seafood chowder was tasty and felt so sinful, but the bread was not really edible. The mushroom bread was also not I'd expect it to be. Their overall presentation of the bakery goods were great but in terms of taste, I would probably skip this next time I'm in Singapore

We like the food at Paris Baguette Wisma and have also been to two outlets in Seoul. However there is a management issue with the Wisma outlet: as others have commented here, there is almost a complete lack of table clearing and when they are cleaned, it is in a very perfunctory manner. Secondly, yesterday afternoon (2nd August), some staff member turned on the "music" at what must have been the highest volume possible. The noise, I would not describe it as music, was atrocious and not in any way akin to enjoyable, rendering conversation across the table impossible. Fortunately one of the waiters agreed to turn the noise down. Management please take note and make the cafe a real treat to visit

Passed by this place for a drink with a friend this afternoon at Wisma Atria. It was fully packed. We waited for a while but some tables were emptied but nobody cleared the left over. When we got one of the waiter to clear, he did it unwillingly and just wiped the small little bit of cakes and pushed onto the floor! OMG! Then later I realised there was a diaper (don't know which customer was so inconsiderate) under my chair! We told the waiter and he gave no expression. Still wondering how could they employ such people with attitude problems. When my friend went to queue for the drinks, she was told that the tea pot were all used up and had to order others???? Anyway, this was my first time there and the impression given to me was absolutely bad. Unhygienic place and poor service though the cakes looked good :

After friends highly recommended this cafÃ© I stopped in for brunch and was very disappointed. The coffee was worth the long wait (they forgot) but the cakes look factory made and are nothing like you find in France. The sweet bacon roll I eat was nice and the box of chocolate twists I took to go were lovely and light but expensive for what they were. Staff were friendly and chatty and seats comfortable
4
Love love love this place. The food is fresh and clean. The decor is trendy and inviting. I loved the camembert cheese cake and the pad thai salad. Customer service could be improved slightly... I was struggling to fit my son's pram through the line (created with movable tape stands) to get to the cashier - the shop was empty and there were 6 people at the register just standing around. No one was interested in assisting.But all if forgiven as the food is worth it

Paris Baguette at Terminal 2 Arrival Hall is where you should sit, savour your artfully crafted pastry or bread with a quaint bottle of milk or coffee, while waiting or just people watching. Loved how the various breads, buns and pastries were creatively made. Everything in the display looked good and if I have no concerns about weight or the price tags on those eye candies, I would have tried everything on display. There is attention to details from how the display is made to entice the passer-by to receiving your tray of goodies with printed napkins to a nicely wrapped/packaged simple ham and cheese baguette (which I had for lunch today). The wasabi crab sandwich platter is definitely a must-try. We've also tried the Earl Grey cake which was probably about 3.5 over 5 due to the subdued Earl Grey taste. The cream was light enough and overall a light and fresh cake which should go well with black coffee. I will definitely try the other items on display another day with more excess quota for calories and fats.

We were expecting really good food here, but were disappointed. The soup was not really hot and the baguette taste like rubber which was really surprising as the French is known to make excellent baguettes. We tasted much better baguettes in Cambodia and Vietnam.

Service very average
Expensive
Coffee - okay but not great
Overall disappointed after reading previous reviews.
Would not go again.....
3 people = $70 - rip off
Could have eaten at the hotel Buffet with everything included for $75.

so many delicious looking and indeed delicious tasting food and drinks in the cafe.
the place is not spacious enough for all the visitor to sit.
the royal pudding is to die for.
but the price will burn a big hole in your pocket.

Though it's called Paris baguette, it doesn't hail from France. It originated from Korea.Though they serve pretty nice pastries, cakes and bread, it would be even better if they can spend at least some effort in enhancing their customer service. No smile while taking orders over the counter is a norm. I would appreciate if they could maybe ask if we wanted our bread warm, but apparently each time I would have to ask them to warm it up for me.Prices wise, according to the quality, I would say it's not expensive. But certain item like the ice orange tea, I felt it's too pricey at S$11. The pastries, cakes and bread pricing are reasonable in my opinion.Not much view to speak about within the cafe as it's located in the middle of a shopping mall. Tables are located closely and therefore, not much privacy. The 4 stars given was due to the taste and quality of the food, not anything else

We clocked this café on our way to another floor in the Wisma Atria for lunch and made a mental not to return for coffee.Impossible to just sit in this café only for a hot drink, the cake display is fabulous as is the range of pastries, sandwiches and just about everything else. The Paris Baguette Company is an oasis in the mall, I defy you to pass the displays without lusting after some calorific input whether it be for breakfast, lunch supper or merely a take out.Comfortable seating and hugely delicious

After hearing about ravings about Korean's bakery Paris Baguette for its freshly-baked, creative pastries for months, but having preferred to avoid the crowds back then, I finally managed to get myself into the bakery cafe for a meal! Located at 435 Orchard Road #02-48 / 53 Wisma Atria, Singapore 239977, the telephone number is 6836 2010.Don't be fooled by the name, Paris Baguette is not a French bakery. But it does offer a very cushy setting with plushy armchairs and soothing gray hues, brightly-lit. What awed us were the rows of delicacies lining the shelves, and while I was spoilt for choice, the Buddy already knew what he wanted. I ventured around trying to make up my mind.Now, I finally selected what I wanted and sat down to enjoy my brunch. I had wanted the Seafood Chowder in Bread Bowl, but the staff informed me that it was not ready yet. It was already 11.30am in the morning....No choice, I selected a fair-skinned beauty, the Seafood Calzone and began to dig in.Pale and grainy looking on the outside, shaped like a miniature Calzone or curry puff, this beauty opens up to reveal chunks of fresh prawns and vegetables in a sweet mayo-like sauce. The flour is minimal, so we got to taste more of the delicious ingredients within.Then there is my Hill Earl Grey Cake - a soft spongy delicacy of tea-flavored delight with layers of sweet cream and strawberries to add fruity hints to the flavor. The Earl Grey flavor was not too strong, so it was easy on the tastebuds and the buttery-softness practically melted in the mouth.For more detailed information and photos, do visit:http://thearcticstar.blogspot.sg/2014/03/after-hearing-about-ravings-about.htm

This cafe hails from Korean, and not the name suggests. We passed by this cafe when we were in Atria and went for the Royal Pudding, bought Strawberry and Mango flavored ones (SGD4.50 each) and a blueberry muffin (SGD3.80) and opt for take-away. While at the queue, I noticed most patrons were hanging around, hence it is very difficult to get a decent place here. They took time to pack the puddings (with ice and foils) and muffin. Was impressed with the packaging!We fell in love with the puddings, the mango being tangy and strawberry not overly sweet yet not over-empowering the taste of the pudding. But I regretted not have a try on the Original flavor. Remember to stop by if you are in Atria

I like the overall look of this cafe...sleek and chic! With a counter smack in the middle of the cafe with pastries and cakes galore, allowing tables to be placed around it; this creates somewhat of a conversation piece.Diners, do take note though: find a table on your own because most of the service staff are found behind the counter. On the floor are servers not from this part of the world, I gather; so training is necessary to uphold the standards I am sure the owners would like. The menu is fairly pricey, but to be fair, the pastries are also of a size that warrants their prices. I had the apple-filled pastry but would have preferred if the pastry was warmed up. Surely for the price, this could have been offered. For brunch, I also ordered the dish 'Cheese with a Difference'. Basically, it was a cheese omelette (with two different types of cheese) served with a side of greens and potato wedges. It was tasty and appetizing. A must-try is the pudding and I had the one with the strawberry. Served in a quaint glassware with a plastic lid, it was sweet enough with a tinge of caramel custard at the bottom. My main concern is the lack of hospitality skills in the servers. Conversation was limited to a few nods. When we were served the omelette, there was zero interaction. I would not say I would not frequent this cafe again, but for the prices; I believe service could be stepped up a notch

Dropped in here by accident in the morning and made the trip back from the other end of orchard road in the afternoon. The food was delicious, especially the sweet bacon roll, white chocolate blunt ( bought 4 to take away) loved the chowder and ( while it was very pricey) also the best coffee we have tasted in Singapore ( loved the caramel macchiato). Well worth a visit, a feast for the eyes, and the taste buds

Just flew in from France and walking along Orchard Road and into the Wisma Atria shopping mall and you are confronted with this beautiful cafe. The bread is surprisingly good and the fillings were delicious, but more surprising was the great coffee. Well done, we were impressed. We went back again. You can also see some of the kitchen area where they prepare very interesting cakes
