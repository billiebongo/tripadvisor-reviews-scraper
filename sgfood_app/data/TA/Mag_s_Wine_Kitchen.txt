Food was amazing and the service was brilliant. A very small but very busy restaurant, booking recommended. Menu is quite small but good pack a punch.

Hidden gem in a very touristic and « dodgy » place, Mags is a very cozy place with a nice atmosphere.
Food was very good, especially the tian of crab meat.
Very large selection of Burgundy wine, prices are reasonable.
Friendly staff.
Good place to go
5
One of best places in Singapore. Small menu consistently good food, excellent wine list. Almost been around for 20 years. Talks volumes. For 10 people book the central table...
My Favourite with a group.

Special place for dinner with friends. very casual atmosphere, yet well managed and good service. Menu is set, and great selections, well cooked, fresh ingredients. will be back.
5
We had a 4 course dinner and the chef has crafted an excellent meal for the evening.
Almost all the dishes were well-executed and the flavors were flawless.
I would highly recommend this restaurant if you like an unpretentious meal.
Look forward to visiting again.

Our Finance Director, a vegan, recommended Mag's a long time back and we pop in on/off from time to time. Some of the menu favourites are gone (missing you short ribs *sob*) and some have stated steady. What I like about Mag's is that you get dependable fare there - from salted butter (don't decide for me if I want unsalted butter) to the starters, all of which I've tried. The snowcrab and burrata are faves. The mains...I'm off beef for a bit so went with the Barramundi, was slightly fishy, first time at Mag's. But not so offputting that I'd send it back. My friend had the beef and polished off the plate. The only grouse, if at all, is that we are kinda over their desserts. So we left after mains in search of better desserts. That said, we will be back like we always do for our faves

Was walking down and pouring rain so popped in for lunch. It's a small place and a pris-fixe menu. Went for 2 courses. Had the well put together crab salad was v good but not awesome. The main of slow cooked lamb in the picture was superb... Perfect. Right size, rich nice veg mix. Top flight. Always excellent wine. Excellent.
4
If you need a decent steak - you will get one here!Mags is small so book aheadService is good, friendly and genuineThey have a crab starter, this is alway worth orderingany of the mains are good, but the aged rump and sirloin are top pick
5
such a simple concept but far too many places get it wrong. four starters, four mains and puddings/cheese. this place gets it right everytime.excellent staff producing great and consistent food at good value. some of the wines are a little expensive compared to other places, but on the whole there is value to be found.always recommend this restaurant, one of the best in town
5
The location is unimpressive - just behind Boat Quay - and the outside doesn't look like much, but the food is very good indeed. The atmosphere is very relaxed, almost like a private member's club, but it is old school in that I suspect the menu hasn't changed for many years. Overall a bit quirky, but a good experience
5
Had a lovely meal with excellent wine and the waiters were fabulous. Well worth a visit. The menu isn't overly complicated - choose from 4 or 5 dishes per course. The coffee was great too.
5
Great food, wine and service. very chilled restaurant with staff who could not be more helpful. Wonderful food every time
5
Excellent food and seasonal menu. The service was friendly
Good cosy atmosphere. Amazing collection of infused Gin worth trying.
5
Had dinner with my wife at the restaurant . The food and services was excellent.
We have lamb shoulder and lobster risotto.
We will definitely Visit this restaurant again for our nights out.
5
Been to Mag's on several occasions and each time we enjoyed ourselves tremendously. the food are awesomely delicious and the service are excellent.
5
I've been to Mag's on many occasions and each time I've been, the food has been consistently excellent. Serving staff were attentive and knowledgeable. Looking forward to going back again soon.
4
Been half a dozen times to Mag's and never disappointed.
Whilst the menu is not large, the quality of the food is consistently high, the wine list is lengthy with reasonable prices, and the service is always excellent.
5
We loved the quality of the food. Having met the owner Mag Tang, we could feel her passion n love for creating food her style. Her love of wine n how it married with her creation was a bonus! The result..quality heartfelt food with a great winelist and a cosy ambience.I recommend this restaurant for quality french bistro food at its honest best.
5
What can I say.Mag's has never failed to deliver on the food and service.Was there for dinner with 5 others and the experience is nothing short of excellent.I called ahead to have them prepare something special for our group, and everyone went home full and happy.We started with some Charcuterie and olives, then we had French mussels from St Michel, which was in season, cooked just right.We then had Wagyu Tomahawk from a special ranch in Southern Australia. Nice and juicy, cooked to perfection.Finished dinner with the softest of Souffle. (which made my night)The wine recommended by the restaurant was very good too. Not too pricey, and punching way above its weight. Great value Overall a great night spent with friends with great food and drinks
5
Mag's has been around for 20 years, and the quality of the food and drink retains its genuine flavour, over a time when many many other eateries in the CBD have come and gone. Since my first visit to Mag's some 10 years ago, the food has remained honest and satisfying, and the service and ambiance always welcoming
5
After opening for 20 years, Mag's cooking has gone from strength to strength. As usual, she did not fail to amaze me. Should have visit more often. Highly recommended.
5
Superb cuisine ... Simple & elegant ... With wonderful & friendly staff who are sincere & look after you. Returned the following evening ... As there is no other place which compares.
5
This bijoux restaurant is a real find. Stumbled across it coming out of Boat Quay. Great food. Great service. Lovely ambiance. And fantastic wine list.
5
A gf of mine is a regular customer here. She always raves about this place. And boy was she right! Everything bout the food is great! One of the better meals I've had. From the scallops to the risotto to the lamb! The owner is friendly and hospitable! Great service too... Till next time.. Soon!
4
If you would like casual French dining in a basic rustic setting then this could be the place. Food was excellent. We chose from the specials. The wine list was great as you would expect and not over priced. It's also close to the CBD although a sweaty walk through Boat Quay! I'll be back for sure

We were visiting Singapore from UK to see our son and his wife who is 6 months pregnant with our first grandchild, for the 2015 Xmas holiday.Our son's friend invited us to lunch at Mag's Wine Kitchen on Circular Road very close to his office. It was immediately obvious that the restaurant had an outstanding atmosphere and this continued for the duration of our meal.The staff were extremely attentive and the level of service was outstanding which we have not always found in other restaurants visited on previous trips to Singapore !We had a three course lunch with wine and the standard of everybody's food was outstanding.I cannot praise this establishment enough and we will certainly patronise them on subsequent trip
5
Living in Singapore, this is my go-to place for modern European food as I can count on consistency across the board: good quality food, fresh produce, good service, and a good selection of wines. The fact that it's been around for almost 20 years speaks for itself, as most F&B places in Singapore don't make it past the 5-year mark. Situated in a cosy 2-storey shop house behind Boat Quay, (the Circular address is correct, but it's NOT at Fort Canning). it's great for large or small groups, and even dates. if you're seated at the middle long table downstairs, you can watch the action in the open-concept kitchen. (But to worry, the ventilation's great, and your clothes/hair won't smell of food when you leave).You can choose a 2-course or 3-course set from the prix fixe menu for both lunch & dinner. Love the Hokkaido scallops (beautifully done), Lobster Risotto, Sea Bass, Kurobuta Pork, and desserts (darn excellent chocolate fondant). Ask if there's anything off the menu when you visit; I once had their Mangalitsa pork, and it was divine
4
Two business friends chose this restaurant as they like to come back there every time they visit Singapore. I cannot blame them. It is located in night active Circular Rd, adjacent to touristy Boat Quay. The restaurant is quite small with one big table in the center and a couple on the side but there is an outside seating area by the roadside. Make sure you have a booking. Service was attentive and friendly but not overbearing. I had a charcuterie platter of high quality as a starter, followed by a sea bass. While the fish was ever so slightly overcooked, the vegetable sides were wonderful and wholesome. Wines served, white and red, were well kept. Especially with whites this is not always the case in the tropical environment of Singapore. All in all, we had a highly enjoyable evening and were the last party to leave at around 10 p.m.I would definitely not mind to come back
4
An expat friend recommended this to me and it did not disappoint. It's a small place which has a nice atmosphere. The set menu has something for everyone. We ate scallops and crab for entree, lamb and sea bass for main, and then we shared dessert: chocolate fondant. Compared to some of the other 'foodie' restaurants in Singapore we thought this was delicious and really good value for money
5
Had dinner here last night it was one of the best meals I've ever had. Crab starter was flavoursome and very well presented. Steak was cooked to perfection. Wine selection is enormous. Not a cheap meal but great value and worth every penny. Service was attentive and very well done. Recommended
5
Liked pretty much everything....the food was awesome and was spoilt with the choice of wines. The best part was the dessert
5
This is a great restaurant with a delicious menu, great wine selections and very fair prices. You can choose 2 or 3 courses for a set price of about $60 both at lunch and dinner. The house wines are reasonably priced and well chosen and there is an extensive wine list if you want to go exotic. I visit frequently for lunch and dinner and am never disappointed. The menu selections are fairly limited as the kitchen is tiny and the restaurant chooses to serve a narrow selection of excellent dishes rather than a wide variety of average ones. There is no bad dish on the menu. The service is always friendly and professional. My only criticism as a regular visitor is that it would be good to have a few more specials or menu rotations so that regulars can visit more frequently without tiring of the menu options
1
What can i say...from food/wine selections/cozy ambience/staff knowledge/reasonable price and service ON POINT!This place got me hooked since 2011, every other month i will make my way here with my partner or friends.Had bachelorette night here, wedding anniversaries,girls nightout,birthdays, celebrate new friends & many more occasions done here!Even my friends come back more than once!Keep up the good work Team Mag!That reminds me i am overdue for a lamb ribs visit ;
5
Not your ordinary restaurant because the service is personalized and we feel so at home in quiet ambience. Don't expect anything less from the menu as Chef Mag is as down to earth with her brilliance in her creative menu as in her delivery! Her duck rillette (my fave), roasted crackling pork, iberico ham downed with Dalva port and generous Leeuwin sauvignon blanc et all made it an afternoon for me to remember with family! Best dish going ~ Salmon sashimi served with Ikura, wasabi, yuzu and garlic chips. Best dessert (my daughter's choice), is choc lava cake with dark chocolate and vanilla ice cream. Those were just the starters and certainly coming back to review the main /entrees shortly! Too wonderful to keep this a secret any longer... Well done Mag

I viisted Meg's Wine kitchen for a business lunch with a business partner in Singapore. I truly enjoyed the place, a easy going room, where kitchen is open wiev in front of you and you can see the food be prepared "live". And now the food, the food is french cusine, so well made ! it is a real pleasure to find such a good french food so far from France! And the wine selection? Also this is so intriguing. We were two people at lunch. We arrived very late at about 2.00 pm and were anyway welcomed from staf, regardless the late time for lunch. I hade two courses and for each one We selected a different tipe of wine. I tool salmom trout sashimi, as entree, and braised black angus as main course, accompained from red wine Cote du Rhone, ( the braised black angus) and from white Chardonnay ( the salmon trout). At the end of the meal We decided to go for another glass of wine and I continued with red wine Cotè di Rhone. Prices are not for everyone, but the very friendly service and the top food quality makes this food- experience worth of it. I enjoyed a lot every single bite and sip, and will return to taste a piece of France in Singapore

Went with a group to Mags Kitchen a month or so back and forgot to review at the time so this is a bit from my memory. I was honestly truly impressed. French food is not my favourite and have had less than average food here in Singapore. This place is outstanding. Does not look anything special on the outside and to be honest is pretty basic inside though perhaps rustic would be a better word. We sat at a big table by the tiny kitchen (is everything tiny in Paris I wonder - ref my reviews of a four day visit recently). The service was very good, although not many food choices which did initially throw me a bit I got over that and had a fantastic meal. Mushroom soup - wonderful; barrimundi - fantastic and dessert my favourite part of any meal, annoyingly I cannot remember what I had. We had a custom made cheese plate which was shared amongst us - really great cheese. The meal in itself was not overly expensive (so I ticked mid-range), there are fixed prices for two or three courses. The wine selection is incredible and this is where our money went. I enjoyed all the wine, not a connoisseur myself, but am assured by my husband that it was all good. I understand you can order cheese and meat platters with wine rather than a whole meal. You could easily go here as a couple or in a group. Not child friendly. I'd say top notch food and lovely warm ambience without the airs and graces of a fancy restaurant
5
This is a wonderful gem of a restaurant tucked away on Circular Road. The place is tiny with a small number of tables for two or four and one large high table in the middle that we've previously booked for 10. The menu rarely changes but the food is of an incredibly high quality and never disappoints. The wine list is extensive (and expensive but where in Singapore isn't!) and staff are friendly and attentive. I would genuinely recommend this to any traveller who is seeking an alternative but excellent place to eat in Singapore. Circular Road isn't particularly smart or trendy (located just behind the better know Boat Quay) but this just adds to the charm of the place
4
Mags is a small bistro type restaurant at Boat Quay. Whilst BQ is located in a bustling restaurant area mags is just that bit more 'restful. Produces fine food from a limited menu Costs are reasonable but probably slightly higher than elsewhere ( about £80 for 2
4
This is a charming spot where you must book as it is always full.A loyal clientele keeps coming back for more which is usually a good sign.The food is simple bistro fare but expertly cooked.The foie gras terrine is generous and delicious although some toasted brioche would be a welcome addition.The lamb ribs are meltingly good.The wines are fairly priced with some really notable Margaret River reds standing out .The service could not be friendlier and you get a warm welcome when you return as inevitably you will.This is a really delightful place
5
We had a smashing night at Mags. The food never disappoints (we have been going to Mags for the last 10 years on our bi-annual trips to Singapore). On this visit, we had the tian of crab, trout sashimi, rack of lamb and the beef tenderlon (among others), all of which were absolutely delicious. Desserts were also divine, especially the coffee creme brulee. Great selection of wines, attentive and friendly service and a cozy atmosphere. All in all a great night and would highly recommend this restaurant
4
for starters, one should really go for the blue swimmer crab - its simply out of this world
they use to have cod for mains but now replaced by the barramundi which in my opinion was overcooked. the pork is good though...
5
Cannot recommend the food and hospitality at Mags highly enough. We ate fantastically fresh crab and trout sashimi, lobster risotto and perfectly judged tenderloin. Also a varied and thoughtfully put together wine list. Will be the first stop on my list when I am next in town.
4
Have eaten here for work lunches on a few occasions, and the food is always on the money.Its a small place and a little boxey, but the service is friendly and professional.Eventually the Circular Road revamp will bring more quality restaurants like this to the area
4
Visited with friends on a recommendation. Food was very good - foie gras and the short lamb ribs. Cheese board for dessert. I could have eaten a slightly bigger portion or just had it bulked up with more veg but Singaporeans only have small appetites ! I liked the atmosphere in the place and the seating was conducive to a nice relaxed night out. Other reviewers have stated about excellent wines but without the price. I guess that's subjective and wouldn't necessarily subscribe to that point of view. We had a very nice bordeaux but at SG$170 a pop is not cheap - not after you've had a couple of bottles and a white with your starter. A great night but I left questioning after a $450 bill for two whether it had really been that great
5
Fine dining food without fine dining price tag; in charming Circular Road environment. Trout sashimi with kosho was a great appetizer. Wild mushroom soup was hearty and delicious. Beef tenderloin (medium rare please!) was outstanding - best such steak in Singapore! And the wine list was very impressive and well priced. Even the desserts were impressive, especially the creme caramel & chocolate fondant. Staff was knowledgeable and helpful. Will definitely recommend. Highly ..
5
Had a fabulous barramundi and a scrumptious kurobutta loin here last week. Have never been disappointed with the food here. Interesting, fresh and full of flavours. Creative mixes and combination of food. Great wine selection at very reasonable prices. Would have no hesitation in recommending the place
4
Been here many times for dinner but seldom had the luxury of time to sit down for lunch since I do not work in town. Finally had that golden opportunity last week and didn't regret it! The restaurant is small in size but has a BIG heart. We had the set lunch which was excellent value. I had seared scallops to start (points to the chef here for cooking them to perfection - being pregnant these had to be fully cooked and were still perfectly succulent). Main was the absolutely divine lobster risotto. I understand this is a dish many regulars come back for and I can see why!Overall, this restaurant to worthy one in city where one is spoilt for choice when it comes to dining options. And if your bill turned out a little higher than anticipated, this is probably because you have indulged a little in the exquisite wine list while soaking up the cosiness and that to me is a perfectly ok excuse ;
5
Mag's Wine Kitchen is perfect for lunch or dinner, and we have never been disappointed, in the 10 years that I have gone there, be it for the set lunch, special menus and wine dinners.Service is consistently good, and staff like Lorenzo, go the extra mile to ensure that we have a wonderful dining experience each visit.The tien of blue crab, ceviche, trout sashimi, botan ebi specials are some of my favourite starters experienced at Mag's. Main course faves include prime rib (divine!), Kurobuta pork chop and milk fed rack of lamb.Fine wine and champagne selection, with the latter being my all-time favourite!Look forward to visiting Mag's again, very soon
4
Sitting in Mags is like sitting in someone's kitchen at their home and enjoying good hospitality. The food is being cooked in full view and you are not separated from the kitchen at all. The service was pretty good - there was one server who was not up to scratch but the rest were on the ball. There is a blackboard menu which does not have a huge amount of choice but I could have tried any of the dishes on it - I would rather have a smaller good menu than a large one that I struggle to find anything I like! I had the scallops to start - or should I say scallop - which was divine but very small and I felt having just one scallop was a bit tight. I then had the fish main which again was delicious but not a huge serving. The lamb my husband had was lovely but again a small serve. The wine list was good and varied at prices you would expect for that quality. Overall, I would go back to Mags as the quality of the food was exceptional but I would ensure I was not hungry before I went. Price wise it is expensive for the portion sizes so be prepared
5
It was there with my bosses and colleagues one day after work, unplanned and with nary an expectation. But when we left, it was unanimous that we will be back again...soon.I ordered the Hokkaido Wild Caught Scallops, while my colleagues had the Ocean Trout Sashimi and Tian Blue-Swimmer Crab Meat for starters. As for mains, we had a mix of the Australian Beef Tenderloin, Pan-Seared Snapper, and Char-Grilled Kurobuta Pork Lion. And they all looked, and tasted, divine. Even better with 2 bottles of Bordeaux, I must add.And to boot, service was top notch in an area not renowned for that
5
Incredible food, never disappoints. Good wine recommendations. Order the blue swimmer crab appetizer!
5
Non pretentious restaurant with short seasonal menu but great food and a good wine list. Prices are reasonable and staff knowledgeable, happy to help with wine choice from extensive list.
4
Mags is a a cosy small French restaurant, with great food.The menu is small, but the quality very high. Great focus on the quality of ingredients, the presentation. Particularly good if you like Lamb, steak, cheese. Good French wine election to.The staff are knowledgeable, the food good value and the ambience fun (though the kitchen is tiny and part of the restaurant
2
Been here many time and always love the food, but this is the second time we have had corked wine and when we bring it up they get very defensive and angry. Shame as what you have going is very good but customer care and how you deal with problems are equally important
5
Had a very long and very enjoyable meal here yesterday evening. The wine selection is fantastic and the staff are extremely attentive and knowledgeable. I had the soup of the day to start which was creamy and delicious. The lamb as a main was perfect, I could not have wanted anything more. Our service was very good as was the wine, I cannot quite fathom what it is those few other reviewers are complaining about. Overall a fantastic evening, great atmosphere and a long and luxuriant meal accompanied by great wine.

First up, if you can't find the place based on the address (86 Circular Road) it is not your fault, nor is it Mags'. The street numbering on Circular Road is different on both sides of the road and is rather confusing. Mags' is opposite the Archipelago Brewery art deco tower, the far end of the street from the Irish pub and UOB Plaza.Once you have found it, everything gets much better. I was there for lunch with friends and I was very impressed. I opened with the carpaccio, followed by the asparagus risotto with lobster. Both were delicious! The asparagus was tender and perfectly cooked. My friends had the lamb and the beef fillet and all three dishes were highly rated. The lunch set was $48 and the bottle of Burgundy they shared came in at $76. The service was prompt and efficient and flowed well. For a business lunch near the CBD, you could do much worse
2
We pre-ordered a rib of beef which was divine. So were the starters although they took an age to arrive. The wine we chose was clearly corked, and the waiter got in a huge strop as a result. Looking at other entries this is not unique, and I've previously had a bad bottle from here as well.Net-net they trade on their reputation too much and they will be left high and dry when the good times end in Singapore
5
I was introduced to this place by a friend and we have been back several times since it is so good. The food is great not a massive choice but that is probably why they can serve what they offer so well. Every thing is cooked to perfection the flavours are perfect and if you are not sure on wine they will recommend something within your price range. Good value for quality perfectly cooked food
5
This is without doubt one of the best restaurants in Singapore! Mag's Wine Kitchen is situated in a diminutive little shophouse towards the North Bridge Road end of Circular Road which runs parallel to Boat Quay. How they manage to create such an amazing menu from a minute kitchen. The menu is fixed price for a choice of about 5 starters and 5 main courses with the occasional special, and hardly changes from year to year but never disappoints. The wine list is also extensive too. The restaurant is on two floors but the ground floor is more lively.Almost daren't post this review for fear of making booking a table that much harder ;-
5
We have been dining at Mag's Winekitchen for many years now. In all those years, the menu has not changed much and fits on a small chalkboard on. But you can count on specials, baesd on whatever looked fresh at the market. Especially on Thursdays and Fridays, the seafood is yummy.The wine list is huge and deep, and you can tell Mag prefers French
