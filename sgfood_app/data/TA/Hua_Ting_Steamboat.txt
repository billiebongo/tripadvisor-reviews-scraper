We had the buffet but due to the lack of variety we topped it up with some a-la-carte dishes.
We had the winter melon soup base at extra $10 as it was highly recommended by the staff. Nothing special.

Very small place. Decent soup base n ingredients but lots of MSG until its so thirsty and the servers dont serve you water unless you request.
Not too bad.

Decided to have lunch in Hua Ting Steam Boat and booked an reservation using an app for 50% discount. Nice display of food with attentive service. I would strong recommend the tomato and herbal soup base. It is really good and tasty on its own.

My 2nd visit to this restaurant. Their special soup is winter melon soup which I had it previously. Less crowded then HDL. But they don’t have free desserts after steamboat. Staffs were very attentive. Service were fast. Order their sake if you are a fun! U will not regret.

Steamboat is so festive and Hua Ting Steamboat is a great choice whether it’s a holiday or just a night out with friends and family. They have put their menu is a custom built iPad app, which helps with all the meal choices they offer, starting with your choice of cooking broth. While it’s possible have two broths, we opted for the winter melon broth which is a seafood and white pepper based broth and fills the whole Steamboat pan. They also have an amazing sauce buffet where you can concoct your own special blend to dip your selected items in after cooking. The restaurant is not very big so I suggest you book a table in advance by visiting the Hua Ting Steamboat web site. Gong Xi Fa Cai!

Because of the rainy weather , thought having steamboat would be a nice change. But my friends and I wanted something different rather than the usual standard fare, so Hua Ting Steamboat restaurant did not disappoint. The place was quite small and strongly advised reservations especially on weekends. Try the chef's special winter melon soup- it got amazing as the dinner progressed. We liked the various choices of sauces and condiments - specially loved the acar which you could just eat as a standalone dish! Yummy...other orders worth trying include the prawn dumplings, rolled beancurd sheets and soft shell crab

Chose to visit Hua Ting steamboat as there was a ongoing credit card promo which offered their steamboat set UP.$48++ per pax now on 1for1 offer. It is located in mall annex of Orchard Hotel and fairly small in seating capacity. It was a weekday and already 1plus in the afternoon so place was not full. Spotted some local celebrities paying the bill whilst we were led toOur table. Ambience was pleasant and clean with no overpowering cooking smells. Lady with mom seated in next table to us did not have this credit card and was told the usual price of $48++ X 2pax would apply(set was minimum 2pax so you could not order just one portion). So I offered to pay with my card (& they could pay me cash) so they could also enjoy the offer. The manager on duty obliged to this without fuss. We ordered the shark bone pork bones broth and it was light but sufficiently fragrant and tasty. The self help condiments section offered a wide variety of sauces from bean paste sauces to belacan chilli pastes to sesame paste and toppings like toasted sesame, coriander, spring onion. But the highlight was dried chilli shrimp (haybee himself) which was yummy. The steamboat set consisted pcs of beef slices, fish paste balls, chicken, slice fish, veg, glass noodles, fried beancurd skin (my personal fave) and also a pack of fish paste to be squeezed into pot like noodles! Then another plate was served consisting of prawns, scallops. All ingredients were very vey fresh. Portions were acceptable given the quality of ingredients. We ordered rice at $2 per bowl. Overall experience enjoyable. Expect to spend at least $50-60++ per pax without promotion

The cuisine on the whole is gd but one of the ladies serving us was so rude and the restaurant was not even full. This is quite a small restaurant in any case and one can only imagine how they can attract customers with such slipshod attitude. One to mis

If you're looking for a quiet steamboat spot to hold large gatherings for your friends or family, Hua Ting Steamboat is one option for you to consider. This 1-year old+ restaurant is owned and operated by Orchard Hotel, a subsidiary of the Millennium & Copthorne Hotels Group. Diners can enjoy hassle-free and delicious mini pots made up of scrumptious broths and freshly-picked, quality ingredients, a perfect setting for your convivial reunions. There are three set menus priced from S$68 per person. We went for the a la carte option so as to try a wide variety of items. This is not an invited tasting review.Summary of Hua Ting Steamboat ReviewAmbience: 8/10Hygiene: 10/10Service: 9/10Price: $50++ per pax Food: 9/10Drinks: 8/10Unique factors: Wide sauce and condiment selection, spaciousAdditional Tips: Mix and match the sauces for a unique twist of flavours. Check out Hua Ting Facebook for periodic offers.The layout at Hua Ting Steamboat is very well-planned— there are two private rooms which can be combined into a single, large room for corporate, friends or family gatherings. Each room can house about 10 people and there are two steamboats in each room. Each steamboat has a divider that allows for two separate broths. The seats are in bright orange, which psychologically has been hypothesised to make one feel even more hungry. One greatest draw to this place is the glass display of live seafood, dried food and fruits, sauces and condiments.We were served by three separate service staff and they were all very friendly and polite. We had several questions about the menu, and they were all able to quickly answer our questions from memory as well as provide great recommendations for our preferences. Prior to the meal, we were given bibs so as to keep our shirts clean! The staff was also adept in clearing dirty and used plates throughout our meal.DIY CondimentsWhile most, if not all, cantonese restaurants have a corner dedicated to condiments and sauces, Hua Ting Steamboat has the widest selection of items. While waiting, my friends and I had a lot of fun coming up with different mixes. It'd be great if each condiment was appropriately named in mandarin and english so that customers, especially tourists, would know what they're selecting from. My favourite mix was sesame, peanut sauce, garlic and onions.These are some of the sauces that were also available:Soy Sauce（酱油）Doubanjiang （豆瓣酱）Chili Oil and Sauces（辣椒油和辣椒酱）Fermented Black Beans or Dou-chi （豆豉）Brown Bean Paste（Sweet Bean Paste 甜面酱）Sha Cha Sauce（沙茶酱）Hoisin Sauce （海鲜酱）Sichuan Mala Seaweed Soup (with Bean Sprouts) and Shark’s Bone Cartilage Soup (with Fresh Beancurd Sheets) — S$26 Their flavourful soup broths are prepared daily. The Sichuan Mala Seaweed Soup is not overwhelmingly spicy such that you can't even drink the soup. However, like all mala soup, it does have a spicy burn that lingers on your tongue. My favourite is to dip the already cooked food into this soup broth as a flavour enhancer. Personally I prefer the Shark Bone's cartilage soup— which boasts full of collagen. With a light milky and mildly sweet savoury flavour, the soup was addictive and we had several refills of it.Superior Fish Soup With Wintermelon & Conpoy (玉环瑶柱鱼汤锅)—S$34 My friends at the other table ordered this— which was a stunning display of winter melon that was well chopped. This soup contains cabbage, winter melon, wolf berries and dried scallops. The soup gradually turns sweeter as the soup boils— making it absolutely delicious. This is the restaurant's signature as the chef was inspired by double-boiled techniques for soups. Cooking techniques differ here too— the center of the winter melon is meant for cooking thin strips of meat (i.e. think shabu shabby while the outer circumference is for larger items that require infusion.Fresh Live Prawns (S$8 for 3 pcs)Prawns are immediately caught from the tank for each order— and they make it easy by inserting them on a stick. It's as simple as leaving your prawns in the steamboat and lifting them out after it's cooked bright orange! Quite fresh! Fresh Kurobuta Pork (S$6 or S$12) The $12 option gives you 8 slices of fresh kurobuta pork. There is also the Fresh Kurobuta Pork Belly (S$7 or $14). These were gone in a flash. Very yummy
