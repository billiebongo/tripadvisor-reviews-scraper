Starbucks offers a relaxing place to sit when tired from all the shopping at VivoCity. We went there twice.

Excellent coffee with really quick service. Not super cheap, but definitely worth it. Not may seats to plan on take away.

We recharged ourselves with a cappuccino & cookies before going out for a Boardwalk from VivoCity to Sentosa island. The Starbucks are almost identical and same across the world.

We stopped every day here for a vanilla latte, & kids had chocolate chip frappes, i found the coffee was really good here.

I like a hot cup of coffee but Starbucks have the machine so hot they burn the coffee. It's bitter as hell. Not my cup of tea!

Starbucks is Starbucks, exactly the same everywhere else. No walls as such as its in the mall and an 'Island'. Good for people watching.

Pretty bad place to have coffee at, more like a takeaway. The place is quite dirty and very noisy. Everyone crowding there for Pokemon catching. Better off drinking elsewhere, seriously.

I have reviewed starbucks most anywhere , and once again doing that ,, The coffee was again awesome and the banana cake was again the best ,,, but what i like about this place is the location .. though crowded it is very relaxing .. have a cuppa and enjoy the tourist and the local crowd ..

Dropped in here for a break from shopping this morning.Had a kickstarter cappuccino and a slice of raspberry cheesecake - not bad although the coffee was warm - should have ordered it very hot. If you are nearby on L2 and need break - this outlet is quite good

I had the worst Starbucks service ever here in Singapore, in Vivo city branch. Staff fudged my question of their reward system for membership. Another staff showed attitude while i am asking for cold water. I think most of their staff are showing their customer that they are truly unhappy with their work

Compared to the other outlet in the same location, this is only good for a quick coffee stop or to get a takeout.

For me I think Starbucks Coffee is popular for coffee in Singapore I don't know about you guys
The reason is because the ice lattes is superb
I suggest that you go for the Ice lattes not for hot lattes

As always...the coffee is pretty standard. The only difference is how hot and how sweet they serve it to you. This shop can serve it the "hottest" ;) Cheers!!!

High standard, quick service.. Very busy!! Difficult to find a place to seat on Saturday or Sunday... Shame it should have a bigger retail

We arrived in the morning. To have breakfast. We took waffle and a bagel. All of them were dry.the cream on the waffle was sour.

was on our way to Sentosa, and had some time so decided to have a coffee with the kids, the kids loved the place, got what they wanted I was happy with the Expresso, and a couple of croissants

Had breakfast of one decaffeinated coffee, one normal coffee and a fruit drink along with Danish pastyry. Service was curt, but it was expensive
5
We first visited the upstairs locations but it was closed but the down stairs one opened early so we went to that one since it was open. Great atmosphere and nice staff. They have a clover that's great for true coffee lovers.

Packed to the brim always as there are many pokemon goers there and it comes off as quite dirty at the place despite the staff working hard to keep it clean. Good that there is another Starbucks in Vivo, Impossible to relax here - more of a takeaway place (please set takeaway price

I visited Starbucks VivoCity earlier this week to get my daily lunch dose. I was very disappointed with the level of service with the barista at the counter. He got my drink wrong and in the end, i did not get the lunch dose i needed daily...This is not the Starbucks Experience i am looking for
