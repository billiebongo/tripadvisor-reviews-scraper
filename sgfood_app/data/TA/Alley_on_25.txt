The dining concept at Andaz - Alley on 25 - is interesting, but also confusing. The hotel staff was very helpful in describing and showing us the different concepts. However, the staff at the various sections were not very well trained, and fumbled on certain requests. The food was good but the menu descriptions did not accurately describe the dishes. E.g. I was expecting the Oxtail Pie as a pie with a nice crust, instead, we were presented with a "Shepard's pie". The seafood stew was very tasty, but again, there was not enough gravy/soup to be considered as a stew

The lobster roll at Icehaus had unfresh lumps of meat soaked in mayonnaise in a sad stale bun. The ham & cheese toastie was super oily. Green juice, leek soup, ice-cream were acceptable. Bill was S$70 for 2 pac, what a disappointing meal! (But go see the interiors by Andre Fu...exquisite).

Had dinner at Smoke & Pepper and desserts at Icehaus.Dinner at Smoke & Pepper was good. Ordered the following to share:1) Shredded Green Papaya and Pumpkin Salad with snake beans, lime-palm sugar dressing2) Boneless Marinated Short Rib, shiso salad, spring onion, sesame, 3) Edamame, sea salt4) Squid, shiso, green chili dressing5) Tiger Prawns, coriander, macadamia nut6) Half Corn-fed Spring Chicken, tamarind, honey, soyAs for desserts at Icehaus, we enjoyed the Andaz Chendol Pop but the Vanilla Soft Serve tasted like cough syrup due to the apricot schnapps.I must say it quite confusing to navigate the place as it is a chain of restaurants as you walk round the 25th Level. Though there is a stand at the “entrance” and “exit” of each restaurant, do not expect a service staff to be there to seat you when you arrive. This was at least true for Smoke & Pepper

Alley on 25 is a cool dining concept with 5 different dining choices. I have tried Smoke and Pepper twice - lunch and dinner - and was not disappointed. The sea bass is a must-try, fresh and nicely grilled with lemongrass, ginger and absolutely tasty. The shishiso peppers with mushroom is also very delicious. Lunch set is a 2 course meal at $25++ and reasonably priced given the location. It is a good place to bring friends and visitors for a Friday night out. Am looking forward to trying out other restaurants at Alley on 25

You walk from restaurant to restaurant to try out different cuisines with different experiences! I checked out Icehaus and Green Oven on my last visit. I had the roast chicken and ox tail stew which was amazing with the toasted sourdough bread - they get their bread from famous local bakery, Tiong Bahru Bakery. And I ended off with a yummy chiffon cake and Pandan pop ice cream at Icehaus. Am waiting to try out the others on the floor

Went to recommendation for subject restaurant at Level 25, Andaz Hotel and wasn’t disappointed. Food served at Green Oven was indeed tasty and palatable. Had the popular Oven-baked Chicken, Lamb Shank and Lobster Mac & Cheese and as well the peanut ice cream dessert. Cost was >$200 for above items ordered given 4 pax.Service rendered was so-so, nothing spectacular but noted friendly. View outside restaurant was fantastic with Singapore Flyer in sight.Overall would recommend this restaurant.

This is a new luxury brand by Hyatt, the hotel and the main restaurant have been open for a short while so we decided to visit starting from the roof top bar located on the 39th floor for pre-dinner drinks. Views are stunning and unobstructed, great atmosphere and service is attentive. The bar is not noisy so everyone can enjoy a drink or cocktail in a truly modern yet relaxing space whilst having a nice conversation.We then proceeded to the 25th floor ("Allen on 25") to have a bite; the main restaurant is divided into 5 main spaces inspired to local food shop houses; different options are available we however decided to go for Asian food (Aunty's Wok), the food was very fresh and tasty - this restaurant is a new concept where diners can literally move flawlessly from one space to the other and/or order food to their table. We ended up having dessert (Pandan chiffon cake) at Ice, which again did not eave us disappointed.Restaurants' employees and everyone else we came across were polite, smily and friendly. We bumped into the Executive Chef, who introduced nicely himself. If you are looking for something different in Singapore (not the usual crowded buffet/bar) do visit you will not regret it
