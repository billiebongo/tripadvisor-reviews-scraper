Staff are friendly but we ordered 1 spaghetti carbonara, 1 spaghetti al funghi and 1 salted egg croissant. Only the croissant taste good.
3
Been here every time when I visit botanical garden. Good place to have morning coffee and croissant. This place usually have breakfast set - Croissant with coffee.
4
A rather nice cafe/restaurant in Bukit Timah. Prices are relatively high. The service is good; food is delivered relatively fast and the staff is friendly.
3
When we went in early evening to eat the tables outside were not clean I had to ask for them to be cleaned up. Only one beer choice does not make for a good selection. Mediocre choice in a city with great choices!
4
Great location right off the Botanic Gardens MRT in Cluny Court, it's a good spot to meet for a coffee or light bite.
4
This is my first time actually eating at a gastronomia outlet and I'm giving it 4 stars solely because of that delicious chocolate cronut we ordered. It has been a few hours and I am still thinking about it. Feels just like first love! Expensive at $5.90 but I'll be back
3
This is part of a chain, aiming to provide drinks, snacks and light meals in a relaxed, informal environment. In some ways it suffers from its own success, in that it is usually very busy, so service can be slow. It is often difficult to find a table, for the same reason. I feel they need to up their game with their waiting on service, to meet that demand. Tables are not cleaned quickly enough (not at all whilst we were there) and alot of the food is rather bland and therefore over-priced. You feel business will fall off if they don't react

The sandwiches in this place are very nice. However, despite the meringue looking delicious, it was just a sweet blob with no chewy centre. Service was poor, staff had no sense of urgency, our tea took ages to arrive and had been left to brew too long. I could understand if it was a busy time, but this wasn't the case. Even though we had left all of the meringue, the member of staff who cleared our table didn't think to ask if everything was ok with the food.Disappointed, will stay away from the overpriced chains from now on
3
Came here on Saturday afternoon and was impressed at first by a tasty sausage and cameralised onion sandwich. Stay however were uninterested and reluctant to speak to customers. The meringue we had next was abysmal and the tea was bitter because they'd taken an age and let it brew too long. Basics are lacking here, don't be fooled by the fancy decor, try upstairs at Simply Bread.

It's a nice little cafe at a nice little flashy location, near to the French embassy and Botanic Gardens. It attracts lots of expats and the richer folks who live in the vicinity. It's a convenient place to meet for people who stay nearby, but there's nothing special about its ambience or food. It's definitely overpriced.
5
Very close to the botanical gardens. Good nice place after a nice walk. Air con helps. If your kids are pasta fanatics like mine. Good to place to be. Close to the mrt.
5
The food is fresh and very tasty. So is the atmosphere, the view outside is good & with friendly helpful staff that make it great. The coffee is also excellent. We found it right across the road from the Botanic Gardens Metro & loved it.
4
Excellent service. Manager went the extra mile since they left with no bread, he went to near Cold Storage and bought the bread to make the excellent Italian panini. Yummy
3
Based on location, its just good to meet people. Their outdoor area faces the busy road which is a bit too much food. they have convenient powerpoints at various parts of wall so one can recharge all the devices. One can pick up various foods like quino salad (good); Brussel sprouts (good) and various other kinds of Italian food - but if one buys just the regular portions of the main course, its like restaurant prices Service seems indifferent though
2
Knowing the brand I stopped by for coffee and lunch on Friday. The tuna sandwich was stale and the coffee was weak and below the standard that one would expect. I was very underwhelmed and left wondering when the quality had degraded by quite so muc
4
Great place for a post Botanic Garden morning walk. Lots of fresh breads and croissants. Coffee is well crafted and nice tasting.Good for a quick bite. Only complaint is that there is not a decent selection of fruits on the breakfast menu. Good for kids with a decent amount of outside seating
4
A delicatessen with a cafe attached. the various of dessert was the first thing that attracted me. It was a hot day in Singapore, after my husband and I stroll around Botanic Garden, we immediately looking for something cool. We bought the Bannoffee Pie and it was sweet and yummy!! It was very expensive though
2
A delicatessen with a cafe attached. Nice terrace outside on the pavement opposite the Botanic Gardens MRT and gate, on the ground floor of the very cute Cluny Court mall which is a haven for expats and well to do locals.The cafe is however rather average - a shame given the potential and location. Coffee is expensive and inconsistent - sometimes watery, sometimes milky, sometimes very strong. Food is also average. Pizza squares are probably the best option. Salads are very expensive, on the two occasions we have eaten them they were dry and tasting as if they'd been hanging around for a day or two, same goes for the spinach frittata. The most inconvenient and frustrating thing about this cafe is that they have no menu that you can take to the table, and do not take your order at the table either. Fine if you know the menu by heart (!) but very annoying when eating alone as you the risk losing your table when you go into order. Annoying when eating as a couple, a group or with a family too...If you want to eat at Cluny Court I'd suggest heading upstairs where there are better alternatives, and for coffee the tiny cafe next door to this one is better. Shame really as this place has a lot of potential
1
Being of italian origins myself, this place has nothing to do with it being Italian style. Espresso is watery, served by unfriendly staff and overly expensive. I went twice because I thought the first time was a bad day. I will not return and I do not recommended it
2
Well, this is basically a store that sells gourmet food. At first I thought it was a cafe, and sure it does have a cafe part to it, but it is mainly a small grocery store that basically specialises in assorted gourmet dishes. Also, as I have mentioned, it is also mainly a grocery store, which means you generally buy the food to take home. At the time I was wanting a cup of coffee, however since I had become quite hot due to walking around the Botanic Gardens, I settled on a bottle of iced tea. The thing that put me off this place though was that I was waiting for ages to get served, and it was only when I realised that I actually had to walk around to the cash register that this would happen. Not really the best experience I had
4
Plus nice ambience and not too crowded with students. Loved their pumpkin soup and many choices for healthy food. Try the beef and mushroom!
4
A lovely stop, great views, lovely coffee, and a relaxed feel...... Sitting and watching traffic go by
5
Also at Great World Shopping Centre. Some very special cakes and pastries in the European patisserie style - calories ooze out of them! Also has a reasonable collection of mostly European wines. One of the better speciality cake shoppes in Singapore.

We visited Singapore at the end of September. On our way to the Botanic Gardens we enjoyed breakfast from this Cafe/Deli. Our party had a nice selection of croissants and various coffees. The service was very friendly.and we enjoyed the experience.
3
The location is superb !They have excellent thin-crust Pizzas. However, the Grilled Chicken I had separately was overdone, dry, and chewy. Spaghetti was good, but again, the sandwiches are quite dry.They have a good collection of wine, but only Peroni as Beer. Maybe they take themselves as an Italian Bistro a bit too seriously
3
I found the thin-crust pizzas, smoked salmon slices quite tasty but not exciting. The tiramisu was too sweet for my liking. Same with the white chocolate desert. Nonetheless, the bistro overlooks the entrance of the botanic gardens which is a nice view to have. Something alarming is the way the breads are displayed - exposed on wood with many tiny insects crawling. To compromise on hygiene for aesthetic appeal? I hope this will be reviewed.
5
My kids love to come here, loving the sandwiches, salad and especially the tomato soup. It is a great choice for lunch and we often get different dishes to share. Coffee is great too. Possible to have breakfast items as well. All in all a great place for a non-complicated lunch withe friends or family.
5
We stopped for a casual dinner and were pleasantly surprised at the wide variety of foods to chose from. The thing we liked was that you could tell them what you wanted and how much so you could really try a lot of different things like salmon quinoa salad, different rice dishes, mac and cheese version for kids, just anything you could think of. And the wine was a bargain
4
Great change from the Asian cuisine !!! The food is well displayed and you can select what you want. The taste is true to its name !!Try the baby sea bass, poach salmon and the pizzas. Loved the chicken pizza and the veg pizza is also great. For dessert try the Valhorla chocolate pastry. .its amazing.
4
We had the sandwiches on ciabatta (about S$12 for a full - I wouldn't bother with a half!). Good bread, good fillings, nice dressing on the salad - the one thing that let it down was that some of the salad inside the sandwich was well past it's best (I mean, gone brown and limp). Service was ok; I would agree with another review though that its a bit silly only having one menu at the door - my wife and I had to go and look at it separately so that we didn't lose the table

Bought a mozzarella cheese recently. Went home to prepare dinner with mozarella. When I opened the packed, the water in the bag was cloudy, and there was foul smell. Checked the expiry date at the back and found it was 2 days overdue!
5
Ah, the cakes!

We visit Gastronomia near the Botanic Gardens very often. Our daughter likes their mini cupcakes and it is just the right place to have a coffee before hitting the Gardens.We recently went there a couple of times for breakfast and it was a good experience.The omelettes we'd ordered were done just right and the staff were accomodating over changing the set. The coffee we'd ordered came on time and tasted very good. The Tiramisu is great as well and so are some of their cakes/breads.The only sore point and this has been pointed out before are the cash register staff. We've encountered one who not only doesn't 'get' the orders but also seems more interested in the bill rather than understanding what the customers want. Slows down the entire process. The rest of the staff however are pretty on the ball

I went for a quick lunch with a friend. You can sit outside facing botanic gardens MRT so it is nice for people watching. Plus outside there is some space to slide the strollers up against the tables. The seating inside is too cramped to do that but without strollers it would be fine. Given you just pick up most of your food from the fridges on the side and it is reasonably basic - soup, salad, pizza etc. - I think it is like an overpriced cafeteria. There is table service when you order a drink. When I went to pay it was sooo slow. There are 2 registers but only 1 was being used and there were an abundance of staff standing around just waiting for direction from the girl at the register. I would go upstairs to the bread shop or Relish instead

I have been to Da Paolo about six times this year. Every time the experience is similar. With 8 staff behind the counter and no queue it takes 10 minutes to get a coffee. Meals served on paper plates with plastic cutlery (great for the environment), and food that looks good, but disappoints each time I try it. In chancery court there are far better places to get a coffee and a cake or a meal. Only positive is the location beside botanic gardens.
4
We returned several times to the Holland Village outlet of Gastronomia. Finding reasonably priced food in Singapore for tourists is a challenge, unless you want to join the locals in food courts/markets. The beers & wines were fine, although what we ordered wasn't always available. The food was fresh, well prepared and presented. Servers were busy, but attentive when you could get their attention
3
we pop by when we want to grab a quick lunch, usually the mozzarella sandwich but there are times when the bread is so hard to the extent that I feel like I'm chipping my teeth with every bite. they offer two types of bread I think, so choose wisely! other than that, the lemon cupcakes and fudgy chocolate cupcakes are delicious
2
Prices suggest table service but don't expect anyone to help you...there's one menu and I mean ONE. It's glued to the wall on the other side of the room to the till where you eventually work out you need to order.If what you order isn't available then you need to sacrifice your position in the confused queue to read the menu again. Dah!You get a table number but have to go and collect everything.Food is actually good (coffee isn't) but the pleasure is lost before you collect it
4
This is a gem of a place. The pizza made here is great, they get the crusts right and the combination of toppings on offer really are good. However, it's western prices so don't expect much change from $40 if you plan on having a beer as well. It's great during the week, but does get busy at peak times, so advisable to book ahead if you want to sit outside. Inside is ok but can be a little chilly like most places in Singapore. It has an open kitchen so you can watch food preparation underway. With the arrival of the Holland Village MRT it makes it a lot easier for those from outside HV to visit; however on our recent visit Chip Bee Gardens was still quiet and enjoyable for dinner

Went with the wife for lunch. Both chose the set menu, both chose "seared tuna sashimi" for starters, "meat of the day" = grilled beef tenderloin for mains. The two course set menu is S$ 27++ (each).Other than us, there were four more customers in the bistro at 1.15PM when we ordered. One table had reached the coffee stage, the other was working on the mains. As we could observe the chefs at work, we noticed a kitchen staff of three, as well as one waitress and one maitre d' . We had to ask for some water. Getting our set lunch, as described above, took a looong time. When the wife asked, we were told both appetizer and mains would be served at the same time.Well. So we got a squarish plate with the meat plus potatoes and half a grilled sausage on one side, and a salad bowl on the other. On top of the salad bowl were two cubes of pan seared tuna, not hot, not cold, and sashimi raw in the middle.So, as we like our meats hot, we started with the mains and finished up with the starters. The beef was excellent quality; the tuna just felt so- so. The whole meal could best be described as "very light".We kind of did not feel that going for the offered deserts would much improve the experience, so tried out the fare offered in the other Cluny Court venues.Altogether, we spent about S# 63 for this two- course set lunch served as single course. While the quality of the meat cannot be faulted, the sluggishness of service can

Nice ambience. Decent italian but nothing to shout about

One of my favorites - mellow, out-of-the-way setting; great kitchen staff. Everything is always perfectly prepared.
4
For your dose of Panna, Squid Ink Pasta alfresco style...obnoxious amounts of white wine too...
5
I tried the one at Chip Bee Garden (Holland Village)
3
Hidden away in a corner, this cosy Da Paolo is great for a romantic dinner. You can't go wrong with Da Paolo really, but frankly, there's nothing very interesting about the menu. Just the usual fine Italian cuisine that most of us expects from fancy restaurants
4
I LIKE <3

(: i love. Friendly staff, consistent food, great vibes.

Standard Italian food

As good as any of the other Da Paolos, nothing mind-blowing though.

Great food. but pricey

Best of the chain with its delectable eats and excellent service.
5
Great Food!!
4
Good pasta (done al dante). Friendly staff. Even offers italian beer, if you're not a wine person. I used to order the Spaghetti Aglio Olio, which was good, but they've removed it from the menu. They still serve it to me tho', if I ask for it
4
Heard so much about it. Will have to try it soon.

Great pizzas and pasta!

Their foie gras is absolutely scrumptious!!

I like the Da Paolo @ Amoy Street.

Creamy rich pasta. Great ambiance. The staff was really friendly when I emailed them to reserve the table for 15 people on my Birthday. They were really nice about the many enquiries I had, whether it was the food, the budget, the ambiance etc.

black squid ink pasta and add in lobster pieces... to die for
