To expensive. Quality was good though but there are cheaper options nearby. Have a look around at the other hotels or the night markets

Good value penang food. The food is tasty and yummy. The service is good but I still find that it is still short of staff. The ambience is good, I can relax and enjoy my coffee after my meal.

Excellent experience at Princess Terrace cafe. Authentic Penang food was served. Went on Christmas Day and place was crowded but kitchen kept replenishing food items.
4
Second visit. Love the desserts segment. Beancurd is yummy. Worth the money as they had promo using uob credit card.
5
Always good. Standards have always remained consistent. Friendly captain who remembers long time customers
4
This place serves the most authentic Penang dishes in singapore. The quality is never compromised, and the staff is always on the ball in clearing the tables. I cannot express how much I enjoy the buffet spread, you just have to try it for yourself!

Dined here with Singaporean friends who consider this to be really good Penang style food. Dining is buffet style with to us large choice of dishes seafood,meats and vegetarian. Tried pigs stomach soup which we found to be surprisingly enjoyable! Lots of different desserts as well and we tried quite a few many using bean curd but most pretty tasty. Being a hotel restaurant we expected would be lots of tourist customers but we seemed to be the only non locals that evening which speaks volumes for the restaurant

Best-loved Penang Buffet in Singapore. Always a favourite for our older generation uncles & aunties. Princess Terrace’s cosy and nostalgic ambience is a most welcome treat for all guests. Serving authentic Penang cuisine such as rojak, char keow teow, kueh pie tie and laksa (Penang style) and with a dedicated dessert area featuring quite a variety of yummy desserts such as nonya kuehs, soy bean curd, bobo chacha and many more! Really worth a visit
4
We have been to Princess Terrace Cafe many times already. There’s many nice dishes such as pig’s stomach soup, fried chicken wing, curry chicken etc. Besides that, they have green bean soup, burbur chacha, soya bean curd, crispy pancakes etc. It would be good if there’s more variety for kids such as ice creams, chocolate fondue etc
4
Leave space for the dessert. Love the kueh with the kaya and the bean curd with gula melaka. The noodle counter with the prawn noodle, assam laksa etc. Still good. The nasi ulam (not many places do this dish) with a bit of belacan and with a bit of petai, "Divine". Very good servic
4
The buffet offers a good and wide varieties of authentic Penang Peranakan food.
A nice cosy place for family gatherings .

For the Price of $50 for dinner I did not find the buffet that exciting. The prawns were tasteless. The curry chicken was delicious so were the prawns and cashews.
Breakfast was good well worth $20 big choice. The staff are really friendly and helpful.
4
Delicious buffet with wide variety of traditional foods. Ingredients are fresh and noticeable care is taken in preparation of dishes. The place is popular and usually busy, so try to make a reservation.
4
Great Buffet of local Penang Nonya cuisine. Highlights Popiah, Rojak, Penang Laksa, Otak Otak, char kwey teow and the list goes one. Dinner session has extra seafood.Desserts are good with Tau foo Fah and the local Keuh ( glutinous cakes)A good variety of Penang cuisin

This place serves the closest versions of penang food in a fantastic variety. The satay is tender and flavourful, the kway pie tee is made hot and crispy, the pig's stomach soup is peppery and always warms the cockles of my heart. The silky smooth chee cheong fun and the sinful shrimp paste sauce that you get to drizzle to your heart's desire, you will be left wanting more than just a serving. The dessert station is a quaint little exhibition of nostalgia; the neatly arranged kuihs that range from kuij talam to ang ku kueh will tempt you even before you start on the mains. The warm dessert soups and the teh tarik/halia is surely not to be missed too. How can I ever lose weight at the rate I go, visiting this amazing restaurant at least once a month? Also, the staff that work in princess Terrace Cafe are one of the most efficient and polite wait staff I have ever come across. That is certainly a comforting gesture, especially when you wish to enjoy your meal. It is always a pleasure to come dine at this reataurant. Feels like home away from home. Well, for my belly

Sometimes, it can be difficult to try all kinds of local food in one trip but this Penang buffet is the answer to this problem. I highly recommend this for anyone who is visiting Singapore for the first time or for anyone who just wants to eat local food but doesn't have enough time or meals. There are a lot to choose from and the quality is really good for a buffet; I enjoyed everything that I had. Some stand out dishes were their chicken wings, chicken satay, char kway teow, pork knuckle, variety of kuehs, and desserts. Staff service was also really good.This Penang buffet definitely makes it to my Singapore restaurants list. Tip: get there early to avoid the crowd. It can get pretty packed even on weekdays!

Celebrated my mom's 78th birthday, our first time here and love the authentic Penang and peranakan delights, the service staff very attentive, prompt in attending to requests. The service staff - Rajwinder, Francis, Bobby, Kumar deserve recognition for doing such a great job in a very busy restaurant.

Went here on 25/8/2017Service was good and fastFood was not bad , pork belly soup ,spicy crayfish ,pork trotter taste pretty goodSeafood lovers might be quite disappointed as their selection of seafood is very limited.Although it's called Penang cuisine but the no.1 Penang cuisine 'Asam laksa' is done wrongly ,taste is way off from those sold in penang hawkers.Char kuey teoh and Rojak is no better but if you don't compare to the authentic ones you have in Penang itself they still taste quite ok.The nonya Kueh was pretty impressive , large selection and very pretty to look at. It taste better than the 'penang cuisine' actually and was the highlight of the dinner for many folks out there. The ironic part is nonya kueh is a malacca cuisine ....

We stayed in this hotel for few days. Bad breakfast & food in the stars cafe. Dishonest receptionist male staff on sunday night shift. We told him that we cancelled breakfast for monday & he said ok & he has made change into our room payment. But when i checked out,i just realized he didnt cancel it so we must paid breakfast that we never had. My bf didnt have time to check it when he paid & left hotel before me.i didnt follow the payment process so i couldnt help him crosscheck the invoice. $40 isnt small money but take much time to claim it back. Lesson : double check ur invoice if u have cancel some order & make sure their staff really listen to u.
4
Second visit here. First time was over four years ago. Still serving great food, wide variety to select from, food always topped up and fresh and attentive staff. We were a table of seven and there was more than enough dishes to keep each of our varied tastes more than satisfied. Attentive and polite staff. Very busy restaurant so bookings are advisable
5
The buffet was excellent. There were a wide selection of food from many different ethnic groups. You won't disappointed. Tea with milk was excellent too.
4
If you are looking for local Peranakan buffet delights, this is the place. Most of the Peranakan dishes you can find here: from satay, laksa, otah, kueh and so much more. Taste wise, they are all pretty good.
1
An expensive and lousy buffet, a very small variety of choices and very expensive. The price that you pay here can get you much better buffet elsewhere
4
Food is quite good. I especially love the Char Kuay Teow, which tastes almost as good (but definitely not the real thing) as Penang Char Kuay Teow
4
Hidden in Kings hotel , is this very nice buffet offering Penang style food .My wife family original from Penang , everytime , we visit Singapore , her brother who lives here will take us for old times . Decor is simple , good spread of buffet . All kinds of spicy food and noodles ( a station for that cook to order ) , the chicken curry , satay , fried chicken wings , outstanding. The pig intestine long cooking soup is one of the kind .All kinds of deserts , cakes , shaved ice with fixtures. . Nothing fancy , always a good time and good meal . We have come on holidays like Xmas , even more variety and need booking 
3
The prawn mee soup, mee goreng, kueh pie tee and satay were good. The service is also excellent.However I don't think the overall quality and quantity justify the price tag of $40-$58 (depending on lunch/dinner, weekday vs weekend).$30 would be the max I would pay for this spread
5
Dinner at the Princess Terrace Cafe offers a tasty buffet of popular Malaysian dishes, including a variety of kuay (Malaysian desserts) and tea. Making reservations would be helpful as the buffet is not huge, but it is definitely satisfying. Being a lover of tea, I was especially excited about the teh halia, the ginger tea. I would recommend trying a little of everything! The only thing to be aware of is that Princess Terrace is located within Copthorne King's Hotel, which is not yet easily accessible by MRT
4
The Penang Nonya buffet is a favourite among my family. We are all small eaters and don't really do justice to an all you can eat buffet, however we love having a variety and a spoonful or two of all the dishes on offer. Where other guests grab half a dozen or a dozen satays at one go, we tend to pick up 1 or 2 sticks - an older gent looked at my sister's plate and remarked: "Is that all?! Eat more lah!"Among the tastier - and in our opinion, more authentic tasting dishes - are the pig tripe soup, spicy crayfish, chicken curry, otak (grilled packets of spiced fish mousse wrapped in banana leaves), Penang char kway teow, and duck herbal soup. The Nasi ulam (herbed rice) was a disappointment as it was gluggy and didn't have enough herbs mixed through it. The fresh popiah (spring rolls) were another disappointment as the filling was rather bland when we expected the rich flavour of shredded jicama stewed slowly in pork and prawn stock.Highlights were the DIY Jiu her (cured cuttlefish)-eng chai (water convovulus) and rojak salads and the desserts. For sweets there was a huge array of Nonya kueh (numerous variants of traditional steamed cakes of glutinous rice, coconut cream and palm sugar) and DIY shaved ice desserts with choose your own mix ins to creat ice kachang, chendol or whatever you fancy
5
Went to this cafe to celebrate a special birthday and to enjoy local foods in aircon comfort a Sunday lunchtime. The food was very good, for me if it is full of Singaporeans you know it's good. We had teenagers in the group and even they were enjoying the food. There are only limited drinks but we were there for the food. It exceeded expectations. We were the last to leave and were not rushed to leave. If you are visiting from overseas give this place a try

@TheKuoKnowsPrincess Terrace doesn't try to be all things to all people. So, unlike buffets at other international hotels that tend to do a bit of everything, it has chosen to focus on Penang fare. Clever!That said, the choice of satays might not be as varied as other establishments. But Chicken Satay is always a safe option, provided it is freshly made, regularly replenished and piping hot. And it is.The Chicken Curry is a standout. Just enough heat to tickle the taste buds but not too much to ruin them for anything else. Mix a portion of Rojak to accompany it. They can go well together.The Char Kway Teow is surprisingly fragrant. Just the right amount of caramalising for an authentic hawker-stall experience.Leave room for dessert, especially the silken tofu. It is one of only a few places that make and serve it regularly. It could do with a ginger syrup rather than a solution of sugar. But that is just nit-picking for an otherwise enjoyable taste of Penang
5
First night out with my wife in Singapore, great place, tasty food, reasonable prices and excellent service. Recommended if you are ever here.
4
Nice food and ambience. The staff were helpful and courteous. The area where the food are placed is rather small and cramp.
5
Love the penang food there. Consistently good food, and it is one of our regular go-to places. There is great variety in terms of hot/cold foods, desserts, fruits and drinks.
5
This was my second visit to Princess Terrace Cafe and it certainly did not disappoint me. I am really amazed by how the standard was maintained in terms of taste and quality. Will visit it again definitely!
5
great service during peak season (CNY) and peak evening hour. crew still have a wow service bringing to their guest and a friendly smile being brought out. food is great! espcially the mee sua teng in herbal soup
5
Great experience and dinner in Princess Terrace Cafe! Even though is peak hour on friday evening, staffs are friendly and food is great! Especially the mee sua teng with herbal soup! No cheat is involve :) everything is worth and will be back soon!
3
Restaurant missed my Chope reservation but was kind enough to arrange a table for 6. Food is tried and tested so very safe Penang fare. Teh Tarik was rather cold I think prob the warmer wasn't working v well. Manager was nice to offer up to two complimentary carpark coupons at the hotel which can cost quite a bit
4
It is not that business friendly as a hotel as there is not much space for meetings - unless you park yourself in the corner of the terrace cafe - friendly staff who don't seem to mind you spending a few hours there. Food is good but service can be a little slow and it does not open until 1100
5
Some of the best Penang dishes to be found outside Penang is here! Never mind that the fried kway teow is not done a la minute. Everything else is just great. Start off with the wide selection of achar (including a cured fish achar). Progress to the tangy laksa, rojak and rendang. Top off with the sinful banana sauce apom.
4
My first time to dine at this place, through a friend's recommendation. They served Panang cuisine lunch buffet only which was the reason I went. Buffet is not my first choice, but I found this place is perfectly fine for the occasion (catching up with visitor), who wanted to have something local and not sitting in the hawker centre, and also have lots of varieties to choose from. I could not eat everything on the buffet counters (cold, hot dishes, salad, soups, desserts (lots of them) and coffee), but I was happy to try some of them. Fresh ingredients and flavour was good. Staff were friendly and service was good (in Singapore standard). It's located in an old hotel lobby, atmosphere isn't grand or fancy. Overall it's a nice dining experience!
4
Brought my parents here for Christmas Day lunch. Most of the food items were excellent. My only regret was not being able to try everything. Faves include pig stomach soup, prawn paste chicken wing, chicken satay, sambal belachan, and all the Kueh Kueh.
4
The Peranakan buffet has a huge selection of dishes and it does not disappoint. Be sure to try the teh-tarik, satay and nyonya kueh-mueh.
5
Have been coming to Princess Terrace for many many years - the hotel was built in the early 70s' and the restaurant has definitely been there for at least 20-30 years.The range of Penang food is quite wide and just taking 1 piece or sample of everything will be more than enough for a meal (so choose your calories carefully) !! My personal favourites are char kway teow, kueh pie tee and roti jala with chicken curry.The satay was meaty and chunky with a nice thick peanut sauce, but this time round wasn't marinated as well as before. The dishes that are cooked individually like noodles and assam laksa are served in small portions which are just nice in size, and also for a second round if you feel like it.Many small kueh-kuehs were available for dessert, some of which I'd never knew the names too. The teh tarik wasn't sweet enough, but the peanut pancake was nice and crispy.Weekday meals are cheaper, and ask for credit card discounts as they usually have some tie-up with local credit cards/banks. They also gave us a coupoon for parking, although it wasn't completely free and had to pay part of the parking charge. But still better than nothing

We booked a table to celebrate our 10th wedding anniversary with another family. We were pleasantly surprised with the decorations- complete with balloons (silver, gold and black), party hats and party packs which come in shimmery gold and silver boxes. The kids were thrilled, the service staff were friendly and accomodating and gave a bunch of balloons to the children.There was also a lucky draw with generous prices.. almost every table got a price or gift,The ambience was good..and the peranakan buffet quality is well-maintained. Thanks, Princess Terrace, for some great memories for our families :
1
Beware of price quoted on their website - IT IS NOT THE REAL PRICE!! Website says $53.80 per person Mon to Thurs dinner so I took my entire family of 8 for dinner but when the bill came it was $56.80 per person. When we complained the manager Ivan told us they now have "festive pricing" and the website is inaccurate. We told him this is unfair and is false advertising but he basically said his price is final and we had to pay the "festive pricing". We are going to report this to Fair Trading
2
We used to go to this restaurant to get our fix of Penang food, our favorite wasPigâ€™s Stomach Soup, and the various noodles. But we have avoided this place since sometime between 11th August to 31st August, they switched to a non-pork menu. The food doesnt taste the same, especially the Char Kway Toew with no lard, it's a bit like all the non-pork chinese restaurants out there, almost okay but somehow just isn't the same
5
The range of dishes on the buffet were impressive. Overall quality was above average. We were so happy to discover not one but two favourite soups - the kiam chye duck and the pig's tripe, nice and peppery. The desserts were definitely worth the calories though the apom bokwa tasted like it was sitting on the plate for a little too long. This needed to be made fresh for every serving. The Penang laksa and the Hokkien noodle soup were rich and satisfying though the kueh pietee shells could have been thinner. These came out of a store-bought tub. As soon as I saw that, I knew I would be disappointed. Other dishes like the Hakka pigs trotters in black vinegar and the roti jala with chicken curry were just delightful!

My mom treated me to this restaurant for penang buffet for lunch today, as my husband got a lunch appointment, so won't be joining us for lunch. The manager told us that the buffet was not ready, so we were not supposed to go to that section yet. However, my mom told him we just wanted to have a look, and he allowed us to do so. He told us to take the seats at the outside first. Since that seat seemed pretty good and comfortable, we just sat there for our lunch. There was a large section and variety of foods available. I had something similar to the gado gado. Shared the popiah with my mom. We could choose either the one in the cup, or the one to be wrapped. My mom chose the one to be wrapped. There were also a lot of main dishes available. The curry chicken and the potato was really good. The deep fried chicken with prawn paste was also good. It came in both chicken wings and chicken drum sticks, so we could choose. The chicken satay was nice and the mixed vegetables was delicious. I did not try the cheong chang fun, as it seemed that it was really plain. There were also a lot of mini desserts available. I tried the bean curd hua which was not too sweet, as we could choose our own syrup (either black or white), and I chose the black syrup. The good thing is that it was served warm. There were also a lot of seasonal fruits, pineapple, water melon, honeydew etc. The service is also really good. As soon as you finish your plate, the waiter will quickly come to clear it for you. Would be even better if besides fork and spoon, also gave each patron knife and chopsticks. Though the price is a bit on the steep end, about $51 plus for Sat lunch, it is still worth it, in my opinion. Also, no making of reservations required, so that is really convenient, if you just want to eat in there at the last minute

The experience at Princess Terrance Cafe was wondering. This cafe has been well known for its Penang food since I was young. Having visited the cafe decades before, I was too young to remember the tastes of the food. The cafe is relative small and the spread is limited as compared to an international buffet. However, I was wrong to have the preconception that the food quality might have changed over the years after looking at the spread and the presentation of the food. The food was not lavishly presented and thus not palatable. However, as I slowly taste all the food in the buffet, I was shocked every time I picked up something new into my mouth. A simple pickled mustard duck soup can be so flavorful and the chef was not stingy in boosting the herbal flavor for the herbal duck mee sua soup! I was impressed. VERY impressed. The cost of the buffet is good, not too expensive. And the quality of the food is superb! I will definitely visit the cafe again when my craving for Penang food haunts me
4
I usually don't take buffets, but this restaurant is one of my exceptions. Loved the Penang Cuisine, especially the soup and the desserts. The wide array of Nyonya desserts is something you couldn't get in many places. Rojak is a D-I-Y, so I can decide how much sauce / chilli / ingredients I want to add.Service is also very good. The waitress noted that my father accidentally dropped some sauce on the chair, so she quickly changed the chair while he got up to go for second round of food. And every time we emptied a plate or got up to get food, the waitress will remove the empty plates immediately.Only problem is the price. For a small eater like me, this buffet is a tad pricey
5
Traditional Singapore food, wide choice of dishes, buffet style cafe yet some dishes are cooked specially for you on the spot, many servery containers to keep the food hot, each meal is available over a number of hours. Many choices for Vegetarians as well
3
Average Spread during breakfast. The restaurant can be crowded with tour groups depending on the time.
3
First time here, brought some tourist friends. The first disappointment was that only kueh pie tee and popiah are made to order. The char kway teow, ice kachang and even teh terik are all pre-prepared batch style, meaning lukewarm and of limited deliciousness. Still, the selection was quite impressive (even some of the rarer Penang specialities). Bit harsh at $50/head, but the tourists didn't seem to mind
4
It's been years since I've been here, and it's even better than I remembered. This is a place I'd happily recommend to visitors who want a taste of Peranakan & Singapore street foods in comfortable surroundings. All my favourites were available from Rojak (a local salad with a sticky, black prawn-based dressing - sounds awful, but tastes divine) to hay-por (a local crayfish) to satay, otak (grilled fish mousse in banana leaf) and a herbal duck soup to chendol (a coconut milk dessert drink). The only disappointment was the fresh spring roll which was very bland despite the smear of chillie dressing on the wrapper.The array of Peranakan sticky cakes were gorgeous. Being a small eater, but greedy for a taste of everything, I halved each bite-sized cake and shared with my Mum - 2 happy old ladies! I'm already looking forward to my next trip to Singapore. I've promised a treat to my daughter who will be in heaven as she loves Asian food

My family of 4 plus my 2-year old grand-daughter had a pleasant lunch at Princess Terrace Café on Good Friday April 3. First-off, making a booking via the cafe web was a breeze. My booking was responded to timely with an email acknowledgement and when we arrived, our booking was on the register and we were shown to our table. Although I had requested for a high-chair for the toddler, the table was not prepared with it. Nonetheless, it was readily tended to and the kiddy cutlery brought over. There was a variety of Penang cuisines which we enjoyed - enjoying some dishes more than others obviously. Suffice to say, with the ample selections, one will not complain. Midway through our lunch, the staff informed that they had cartoon screening at a room next to the café which children could go to enjoy. This was a good way to make the outing very family-oriented and I do commend the staff for their effort.Overall, it was a very pleasant experience, made so also by staff who are so attentive to details - like clearing used cutleries, and making sure our table is not cluttered, chefs constantly checking that the dishes at the buffet table are replenished once they are running low etc. Well done for making this wonderful experience for my family. cheers, Christine La

The Penang foods buffet at Princess Terrace Café, Copthorne King’s Hotel is likely one of the best place in Singapore to sample the wide range of Penang street foods such as Laksa, Prawn Noodle Soup, Char Kway Teow, Nyonya Kueh, etc. However just be reminded that this is not a place for fine Peranakan dishes. At the dessert corner there is a good spread of different types of Nyonya Kueh too.While it is agreeable that best Penang Foods can only be found in Penang, but without travelling 500miles north and eating in this air-conditioned cafe in Singapore, one should be satisfied with what this buffet spread can offer. The ambience is good and service is attentive and efficient. Weekday dinner costs S$48.80 ++ per pax
4
old settings, food is nice. They have laksa, chinese soups, salad, kuehs... etc. I like the man chang kueh that is made fresh by a young boy at the food counter, the pig stomach soup is nice.They don't have knifes on your dinning table, you have to get it from the table near the buffet spread. I saw bread and butter but no western soup.Overall, quite a pleasant meal we had
4
After an absence of about four years, I recently returned to lunch at the Princess Cafe, Copthorne King's Hotel, which is fairly well known in Singapore for their Penang spread. I stayed away for four years because in my last visit, I thought the food was quite pedestrian at best, having eaten some of the better Penang foods in Penang itself.This being a treat, I didn't mind returning to see how the cafe is doing. And I must say, they have improved by quite a wide margin.The lunch buffet at about S$44.80++ (weekdays) and dinner at S$46.80 per head* (not cheap at all) had more items than what I could possibly eat. So I sampled my favourites and left some out for my next visit. I was advised by my friend to leave room for the "nyonya kueh" (desserts).I was especially impressed with the "kiam chye ark" (salted vegetable and duck) soup. It had punch. It would have been perfect if I had broken pieces of green chillies and a teaspoon of brandy to add to this salty (but not overly so) and sourish soup. There was no "ducky" smell.The pig's stomach soup was peppery and went very well with rice. The prawn noodle soup was of good standard but not better than the ones in Penang. The broth was rich, had fried lard bits and the prawns were of fair quality.I liked the "ngoh hiang" a fried pork and liver roll. Although it was not as delicate as the ones I had in Penang, it was better than some of the rolls I have tried in other Penang food outlets in Singapore.Some of the starters were really good, piquant, slightly spicy and just enough to whet one's appetite. The "popiah" (fresh spring rolls that's sweetish and garlicky) was quite well made and overly sweet but I would have preferred more and better ingredients.Other must try items are Penang laksa, chicken satay, curry chicken, kueh pie tee, fried kway teow and duck thigh mee sua.To end the meal, there's a good spread of nyonya kueh, from kueh salat to banana apom balik, and from cendol (coconut milk, red bean and green flour strips in shaved ice and gula melaka syrup) to bingka ubi or tapioca cake, and ice kacang, which you can make your own. Finish off with the fresh brewed coffee, which is strong and fragrant.* Weekday dinner is priced at $48.40++ per adult. On Friday-Sunday and public holidays its $51.80++

Just had dinner here tonight. Outstanding items were the Penang laksa and the array of Nonya kueh. After being spoiled by the high standard of kueh Pie Tee and Popiah in Malacca, these items were good enough but not particularly outstanding. We enjoyed the fried chicken which was well seasoned and fried to the right done-ness.I am looking forward to tasting the Malaysian food at the Malacca Cafe of the Traders Hotel in Hong Kong next month to see if they are as good if not better than the standard here
4
Quality as good or better than street fare in Penang but eaten in air-conditioned comfort with prompt service. A number of live stations and I highly recommend the Penang laksa and Hokkien prawn mee. Char kway teow, popiah, kueh pie tee, satay - All authentic and delectable!Must leave some space for the fabulous desserts - apom balek, crispy peanut pancake (with a long queue!), tow huay, glutinous rice with kaya (lather this on thickly!) and other Nyonya kueh. I was delighted to see teh tarik being served but was disappointed with the quality - somewhat too diluted.Overall, a wonderful meal and we will surely be regulars
5
Booked and filled a table for ten. Hosted a group of clients and work colleagues for dinner. We all loved it. What else can you say but try it and try as much as you can fit in. Will be back for more.
4
The quality of food here never disappoints. Love the pigs stomach soup, penang laksa, poh piah was exquisite. The penang char kuey teow was done just right. Loads of other food and desserts.
4
Excellent selection of authentic Malayan food. Service was cheerful , fast. Prices for downtown Singapore fair. Would certainly return.
4
We've been visiting this place for 20 years; the dishes served, their quality, and the ambience remain remarkably unchanged! There are lots of customers who come back generation after generation - ranging from celebrities to 'ordinary' locals who just enjoy the amazing diversity of Nyonya street food on offer (including desserts). The dishes served here are not the more 'refined' Peranakan dishes (for which True Blue on Armenian Street is among the best in Singapore), but street food found in Penang. Okay, you can find better hokkien prawn mee (or some of the other dishes on offer here) at some hawkers in SIngapore or Penang, but the versions here are pretty good. Service is attentive and efficient. The tourists who think this is too ordinary (from some of the reviews below) just miss out what this eatery is about - they should just go to the buffet at the Ritz-Carlton or Shangri-La hotels
4
I met some friends here for lunch on my trip to Singapore as they said it would give me a taste of the food I would experience on my trip to Malacca. It was better than my trip to Malacca .It was as much as you can eat , with a lady making delicious spring rolls as spicy as you wanted them. It was busy ,but you never had to queue for anything as there were a few stations to help yourself . I am a vegetarian and still found plenty to choose from , my husband eats anything that walks, flys or swims and he really enjoyed it , although he didn't try the pig stomach soup !My Singaporean friend had it and said it was good.If I go back to Singapore I would definitely return there.It was very clean and I hadn't visited The Kings Hotel for a few years, but I thought they had done it up very well and it was decorated ready for Chinese New Year 
3
Was brought here by family and i came here with an open mind. There are some interesting dishes that i never had for starters like "fried porridge", which was ok. The pig stomach soup probably used kilograms of white pepper. The carrot cake and stir fried noodles buffet style were so mass produced that you have to set expectations even lower than for most 5 star buffets in town. The "made-to-order" noodles like penang laksa and prawn mee were slightly better, but doesn't blow anyone's mind. There are some DIY desserts like ice kachang but again, nothing specialFor about $50 for a buffet lunch and more for a dinner, this is rather expensive indeed. Good for a novelty experience but certainly not a gourmand's dream. But it's not terrible nor poo
4
The place to go for penang food. They served good prawn noodle, kueh pai ti, alot of penang style dessert ie nonya kueh, self made ice kachang and chendol, laksa, Satay and alot alot more. Very value for money too. Went there during diner and managed to get a seat without prior booking. Spread was quite wide as well. Overall it was a gd place if u wan to eat penang Peranakan food

I went for the Penang buffet dinner on the 02.08.13 for my friend's badge that celebration which I assume the foods should be good base on the reviews. But to my disappointment, the hotel food was the worst I ever came across. Foods like popian only wrapped with turnip, vege and bean sprout without peanuts, egg, shrimp or even mushroom. The famous penang laksa was so salty, the Hokkien mee soup was so blend. Limited fruit, dessert and food selection but charging expensive. After my first round of the food, I don't even feel like going for my second round. The food simply looks cheap, taste horrible and just cannot wonder how people can grade the food 4 to 4.5 stars out of 5. I personally went Penang before and had tried their local food, their hawker food taste so much better than the what the hotel served. Thus, I urge those who can give such a high grade to go Penang and tried their local food and definitely you will know what am I driving at. If not, you can just go the coffee shop beside the Aljunied MRT station to try their Penang Hokkien Mee and see the differences.Last but not least, their hotel staff service are so unprofessional. I had sent email to make reservation with no confirmed response and had to call and check with them. During my dinner, our drinks for ice water was not topped up even though not much guest around and staffs are seen standing down there. Fork and spoons were kept being cleared away without replacement.

The irreverent Travelling Gourmet goes to Princess Terrace in King’s Hotel for…MANY Penang specialities cooked by modest & cheerful Chef Loh Hong Chye which attracts food lovers & celebrities like Senior Minister Emeritus Goh Chok Tong, Defence Minister Ng Eng Hen, retired Minister Lim Boon Heng & the Princess of Brunei. Chef Loh always fries up a la minute a special plate of his Char Koay Teow for me. Chef Loh’s Char Koay Teow of tender slippery rice noodles with giant prawns, lashings of crunchy bean sprouts and real Bak Eu Phok (crispy pork skin crackling) & scrambled egg is to hijack a plane for! It’s authentic beacuse Chef Loh hails from Penang. Ich liebe es! (I love it in German) The Ark Thui Mee Sua is also delicious…fall off the bone tender duck drumstick meat with sphagettini-like noodles (mee sua) in a rich broth double-boiled with powerful Chinese herbs and red wolfberries and red dates is super-yummy. I matched this with a glass of squid ink black & suprisingly youthful 17 year old 1995 Chateau Troplong Mondot St. Emilion Grand Cru Classe (13.5% abv) with silky tannins and cassis notes plus nuances of cloves. They went well together.Hong Ark or braised duck in a velvety sauce and Chee Cheong Fun with sweet sauce, sprinkled with white sesame seeds and fragrant sesame oil are other palate pleasers. Nyonya delights like yellow Roti Jala (net like pancake) with Penang style Chicken Curry, and Nasi Kunyit or Turmeric glutinous rice with whole black peppercorns, and Ch’air Hu or bean curd & fermented soya bean salad with tangy Tamarind sauce tempt and delight. Popiah and Kueh Pie Tee is made a la minute for your enjoyment. On occasion there is also Lor Bak which is spring roll of lean pork wrapped in crispy bean curd skin with crunchy fresh cucumber!. One of my favourite dishes!Delectable Desserts of colourful Nyonya Kueh like Kueh Talam Hijau topped with Santan gelee and Apom Balek or coconut pancakes with a thick, luscious toffee-like sauce with banana medallions as well as Ice Kachang, Chendol with loads of crushed ice and fragrant Gula Melaka (coconut sugar) plus Ban Ch’an Kueh or crispy 0.5mm thick crispy peanut pancake make for a satisfying sweet finale! Penang or Pulau Pinang is a small island known as “The Pearl of the Orient” in West Malaysia known for its culinary specialities. Its cusine is a unique & eclectic blend of Portuguese, Malay, Indonesian, Vietnamese, Chinese, Cantonese, Hokkien, Dutch & Eurasian influences & ingredients. ENJOY! {:-

Really like the quality of the food. It's a great buffet for penang food. Very popular, must make a reservation I won't bother if you think you can walk it. It's got great variety even though the place itself is not huge. Love the prawn noodles, very good soup base. Love the popiah too and the gula melaka available for the desserts (chendol). My pick for penang food in singapore
