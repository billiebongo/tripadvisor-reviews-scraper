If you are lucky enough to find this excellent restaurant I'll promise you a tasteful, enjoyable meal of Cantonese food. The service is very good and the food makes it absolutely worth visiting this place!

Great dim sums at affordable prices. The service is also prompt and friendly. Loved their pork and century egg porridge. The best I have ever had!
5
This is my fourth times visited this restaurants. Will visit this restaurant every time I’m here. The food was really delicious and the staff was friendly. One of the best Chinese cuisine I ever have at Singapore.

Good dim sum but the portion of roast pork has been going downhill. The number of pieces remained the same as the past but the thickness of each meat cube had shrunk to half or more. That is disappointing.
4
Food was delicious and experience the Singapore local seafood dinner.
Price are considering cheapest.
Worth of money.
Quality was super good.
We will be back

Quick and attentive staff and food is really delicious. Recommended many friends from overseas to have a meal there. All of them simply enjoyed it and came back on their own. Family reunion is mostly held there and looking forward to it. Must try!!Diana Ta

Dinner on Christmas day; roast crackling pork, claypot rice, yu tiaw with prawn, tow foo. Service was friendly and efficient. The pork was nice, portion a little small, but most restaurants seem to charge this much for their pork. Highlight was probably the tow foo, with a nice blend of flavours. The claypot rice was a disappointment - true, it was chock full of chicken, pork, chinese sausage.. but we eat claypot rice for the rice, and flavour was a bit lacking. Price was also pretty steep for the claypot rice, for a medium bowl. Bill came to >$200 for 4 persons. Overall, reasonably pleasant food, standard restaurant ambience, efficient service - but probably not worth the special trip down

Jade Palace has been here for more than 30 years. Quality of the dim sum offering is still excellent. Apart from the usual "Siew mai" and "Har kow", their beef balls, salted egg york with squid or yu-tiao is worth a try. Their dumpling soup is a must for us. For dinner, their seafood offering is fantastic. Enjoy.

This Cantonese restaurant is located at B1 of Forum along Orchard Rd, just within walking distance of Hilton Hotel, Orchard Parade Hotel and Regent Hotel. It is one of my favourite restaurants for Family and Business Associates.I came with the intention to eat Hairy Restaurant from YangChengHu, China. Was told by the Manager that the first batch only arrives next week. We ordered Century Egg with Pickles, 1 pot of Pig Intestines Soup with Lotus Root, Clams stirred fried with XO sauce and Fried Hong Kong Kailan with Beef. It was a simple dinner but every dish tickles your taste buds. Clams were fresh and goes very well with the XO sauce and spring onion.

This was a family lunch. The prawn with vermicelli in claypot was a tad well cooked; Peking duck with pancake was cooked to perfection. The Durian Mochi was an unusual combination with a texture that just melts in your mouth surprisingly without the usual overpowering durian taste. Good fast and friendly service as always.
5
My husband and I stopped in here for a quick Dim Sum lunch on a recent trip to Singapore from Australia. Food was excellent, service impeccable and very reasonably priced for the quality. Highly recommend and we will definitely be back.
5
Have been visiting Jade Palace about once a month and they consistently provide good service. Their food is also good. Dim Sum prices are very reasonable. Love the pork and century egg porridge!
5
Wonderful food. Everything was well prepared. Great taste, fresh ingredients. Lemon chicken was the best I've had. Soup was delicious. Some of the best!
4
Great place, service and wonderful Chinese cuisine.
The lamb & soup was beautiful. Fried hor fun with beef was perfect.
Overall very good taste dishes. Will definitely go there again in my next trip.

This venue has an extremely good wine list at reasonable markups in the Singapore pricing context. For example champagne, particularly luxury cuvees, is about Singapore retail. However the real bonus is that the restaurant offers byo for wine with no corkage charge, at all sittings. The glassware is very good, with large balloon glasses perfect for red burgundy and the wine service by the staff leaves most Australian restaurants (my reference point) far behind. We enjoyed our byo 2012 Giaconda chardonnay and 2012 Domain Rousseau Gevrey Chambertin immensely with some flavoursome Cantonese style food. The prices are quite reasonable (unless you give the fresh seafood a workout in which case you will run up a bill) and dinner for 4 was about $SG200. Note that it is the basement of a small shopping mall. When you first go down the escalator you will see fast food signs but don't worry, you are in the right place and will quickly find the entrance

Sure, new places and new outlets from chains open and close seemingly every month. But here's one tried and tested and tasted. It has remained consistently good for more than a decade without changing locations!What's good, dimsum to humble claypot rice, to fancy truffle to a great wine collection that is still reasonably priced and curated.It remains the go to place for locals or those in the know. From family reunions to those who want to impress with great food, great service and all that is truly meaningful.So we had a set lunch with lobster noodles, good if unusual soup, not the most common dimsum plus couble meat platter (roast duck and soy chicken) and we supplemented with a great humble veggie dish. Mustard green in stock. Finest dining without frills

Been this place many times and never failed me for their food quality, service and best you can bring lots of wine and liquor with no corkage . Do eat the lamb spare ribs that tasted out of the world , steam sole fish, frog leg fried with ginger till crispy! Boiled live prawn, fried chicken soft bone , salted egg crab, claypot rice and roasted belly pork... lovely restaurant served with experienced staff .. changing your wine glass when you change your type of wine without any concern.

We were recommended to this Cantonese restaurant by a supervisor we met at Tai Woo Restaurant in Hong Kong. Apparently the owner, chef and many of the service staff were from Hong Kong restaurant. We decided to do a taste test over lunch. Tucked in the basement of the Forum Mall, the space, decor and table setting reminded us of the family-style Cantonese restaurants like Lei Garden and Tsui Hang. Even the service staff spoke a smattering of Cantonese and the a-la-carte and dim sum menu brought back fond memories of tasty eats in Hong Kong.We order several dim sum items, some roast quails, deep-fried chicken soft bones and a seasonal fish dish. The cooking techniques and flavors were reminiscence of Hong Kong. There was nothing to fault in the taste and presentation of each dish. The fish dorsal fin and skin was accentuated by a mixture of black beans, garlic and spring onion. The meat was moist and tender, the skin was thick and glutenous. The deep-fried morsels of chicken soft bone were crispy and salty. The roasted quails were perfectly cooked. The skin was fragrant and crispy, and the meat well seasoned. The dim sums were on point. We enjoyed the right texture of crunch and moist prawns flesh wrapped in deep-fried beancurd skin. The chicken feet soaked up the rich marinade and fell of the bone easily. The deep-fried fish balls were an interesting texture of moist chewiness and thick slices of cuttlefish swam in a light curry sauce.Service was friendly and attentive despite the full covers. Our Chinese tea was refilled regularly without asking
4
Staff are all round friendly & well experienced.Food always good & rest assured your wines will be well taken care off.Ample glasses & decanters for whatever wines you may have, plus glasses are always sparkling clean. I always go away satisfied after a meal her

I have been there three times so far and finally decided to write a review on them. Strangely it did not strike me to leave any review as I presume it is well known enough for everyone! Alright. Perhaps we need to help the Travellers. The food here is well prepared and flavourful with creativity thrown in for good measure. A lot of interesting dishes and choices not found in the usual grand Chinese restaurant. I live their cold crab there but I could only had it once out of three visits. One time was because of sold out! The other time was because the quality of the crab itself. Accordingly to the server, she told me that the Chef rejected the crab after they cooked it and found out that it was not good enough to be served. So, there you have it - Chef who takes pride in his work. The other dishes are good - Claypot rice which is so difficult to find those with Chinese liver sausage in them, frog legs with crispy sliced ginger and egg white with scallops in truffles oil. Their Dim sum are good too. Finally, they have free corkage BYO policy. Hard to come by these days.
5
Wonderful place to experience dim sum with friends, our group ordered 15 different dishes and everything was delicious and the service was fantastic... definitely a highlight of my time in Singapore. Strongly recommend to anyone in the area.
5
Went a couple of months ago in a group and when I came to Singapore for other things took my wife and a friend there. It was as good as the first time. Seafood is excellent, service fantastic and choices were immense! Can't fault it!!
5
Had lunch here, really good dim sum! Awesome service and great favours! Worth the while as food is very consistent!
5
Had another great lunch here!! Food as usual is amazing. Had their "little yellow fish". Nicely fried and has great taste as well!! This place never fail! Great wine selections too!
4
It was great service and very fast and friendly. Food was fantastic. Everything cooked and presented very well. My wife is in Singapore in January 17 and I'm going to recommend she goes there. I will be happy to go back next time I go.

Having been to Jade Palace on at least 5-6 occasions (for both family and business purposes) in the past 2 years, I have to say that the food is always of a premium standard with strong and robust flavours in almost all of the dishes. Some of my favourite dishes include the Crispy Roast Pork and Fried Bamboo Shoots (for starters), Sauteed Beef Cubes, the Claypot Rice and the Claypot Crab Noodles. On a recent visit for a business lunch, we also had the privilege of trying their lobster tail which was very fresh, springy and cooked lightly in a Chinese-style broth so that the lobster tail did not lose its freshness.Jade Palace also has a wide range of desserts (as if the main meal wasn't enough) which includes traditional Cantonese style desserts like the Chinese Sponge Cake (Ma Lai Gou), the Fried Red Bean Pancake, Durian mochi as well as individual desserts like Mango Sago, Herbal Jelly, Aloe Vera Jelly, etc. Jade Palace is conveniently located at the basement of Forum Shopping Mall, which is never ever really too crowded although reservations are a must if you are visiting on a weekend for dinner. Ambience-wise, the restaurant is a traditional Chinese/ Cantonese restaurant so nothing over-the-top in terms of decor but what you do not get in terms of high-end decor, you get in terms of the quality of the food
3
We've been visiting Jade Palace for a number of years now. It's usually the go-to when we have guests visiting and wanting to eat some dim sum around the orchard area. Has one of the best wine selection in town.Truthfully, the standards are not as before. Still the two things that we always order is the Claypot Rice and Cold Crab. Good 'smoky-ness' on the Rice and the Lap Cheong is just right. Just a tip: Order the Claypot Rice the moment you get seated. Then wait till it comes before ordering the other side dishes
3
Place looks and probably is old. Ordered the usual dim sum favourites - roast pork, pork pastry, rice rolls, egg tarts etc. They were ok. Also ordered the mee pok with crab meat. Couldn't taste or see the crab but the noodles were good. Maybe not ss good as imperial treasure's mee pok with truffle oil but good enoug
4
In my mind, the Jade Palace has been in existence forever and is one of those places that you know you will enjoy and expect to return, but never do. It has been nearly 5 or 6 years and re-entering it was like coming to a favorite aunt’s home - familiar and with good memories.I expected the food to lean towards home cooking and that is what we got. More attention to taste and value, and less towards being cutting edge or haute. The cuisine is Cantonese and I strongly recommend you stick to it. Forget the Peking duck. In fact, its best to avoid anything fried (the Cantonese are much better at steaming and light stir fries). We had the classic tripe combination as our starter, namely roast duck, char siu (caramelized pork loin) and siu yuk (roast pork belly). The duck was ok, but the char siu was tender, not overly sweet with a tiny burnt edge to cut through the caramel. The siu yuk was dry to the touch, crispy on the top, moist on the bottom without a fatty taste. We then had the soup of the day (in Cantonese food, if there is no soup its not a meal) being lotus root soup with lean ribs. The lotus could have been fresher but the balance of marrow to earthiness of the root as good - very tasty. Steamed fish followed and it was done beautifully, just cooked (slight tension between meat and bone but extremely moist) with good quality soya sauce, old ginger flavored with spring onions. A must with fragrant white rice. We also had a classic claypot of beef – not bad – and Chinese greens stir fried with garlic (the only slightly disappointing dish, the greens were not crisp enough and the garlic was a little over powering). We also had 'waxed rice' an extravagance of calories given the fish dish. I loved the waxed liver sausage but the duck was again only so-so. The sauce that you were given to dress the rice was again delicate and artful.We ended with a very unconventional durian rice drops (like mocha) and I loved every mouthful (but then I love durian and the rice was so smooth and sensual). I guess I can name one other restaurant that could do each of the dishes better, but the overall experience and at the price the Jade charges, its very good and very good value
4
restaurant has been around for a long time at forum. believed owned by hong kong owners with the only outlet in singapore. The location is excellent along orchard road though it could have been better if it has a commanding view of the main road. It is located at the basement floor, lower ground, if not mistaken. Similar owner outlets are in hong kong, two I was informed by them. Excellent place for hong kong cantonese dishes especially seafood. prices are mid range. another plus point , it closes quite late at 11 pm, so late dinners are still ok
5
This has always been my favour restaurants which never fails each and every time. Truly a great place for great quality and favoursome food. The staff are very helpful
4
Located at the lower level of Forum Galleria, this Chinese restaurant never disappoints! Be sure to order the roast pork and dim sum specials. The braised goose web and sea cucumber is highly recommended. The lobster noodle is also superb!!
5
Jade palace is the place i have been patronizing for years, good for family event and i never failed to bring overseas visitorDim sum to serious sea food to suckling pig (to pre order)The service is nice, professional and friendlyThe wine list is wow...and chea
4
Good food, lots of staff, no napkins and somewhat slow delivery of food. Extra costs for beans on table, for service and for tea . It's a place where, as soon as you move, the staff are in attendance so absolutely no complaint about service but in my opinion there are better places. That's not to say that the food is not very good, it is.
4
Walked in the restaurant for lunch today and was greeted warmly and then Terry the Manager took my order. Knowing I was not a local guest he personally served the entire order after taking the order himself. Overall a friendly and efficient team. The choices we great good Dim sum, Peking duck prepared by a Hong Kong chef.Highly recommend you try this restaurant next door to the Hilton on Orchard Road
4
I used to patronize Jade Palace with my parents many years ago. Used to love their dim sum especially their pork and century egg porridge, of course prices have increased multiple folds over the years but they managed to keep their standard up until my last visit. Was very disappointed that their pork and century egg porridge was watery (Cantonese people will say they stir the porridge too much until the water has separated). The waitress also did not give us napkins until we noticed other diners having and we requested. They also charged for water
5
I have been here once before with Frens and immediately liked the ambience and the food. Heard that this Forum Galeria outlet is their only outlet as he chef wants to control their Quality. I immediately booked the private room for my Father in law 80th bday, 2 tables , min spend $800 per table. 2 weeks before the event I started whatsapp with Mr Ho , their manager.. Who was very kind to Customise our own Menu to slightly above $800 per tanle.. Yups worked out to be $138 per person but with every cent paid... The food was super delicious esp the Peking Duck was huge and I must say the Cold Dish Starter was the largest and best I have ever seen ...we had 2 assigned service staff who were excellent too and kept us entertained. The wine selection was huge and a good spread of countries and vintages ... Yes a very pricey place ... But worth it for really special occasions like 80th Birthday , Blessed indeed
4
We like to dine at this HongKong style restaurant as the food is very good. The roast meats are delicious. Last night we had roast duck which was so tasty and the skin so crisp, we wished we had ordered more. Our family loves the bamboo clams which are served singly. Amazing every time!! The service was quick and good. You can't go wrong with the food here because every dish is done very well. The desserts are pretty darn good- the steamed cake and osmanthus jelly. You will not be disappointed with the food quality here.
5
This is my favourite clay pot rice restaurant, the clay pot rice is just out of this world. I also like the deep fried from leg with ginger, very yummy and tasty. You can bring your own wine and it's cockage free here, else, the wine list is very complete and price is very reasonable too
4
Serving very good dim sum and Cantonese cuisine, accompanied by a good wine list, this family restaurant tucked away in the basement of Forum Shopping Mall has survived through the years with their steady influx of loyal customers. The only downside is that the restaurant can get too noisy for a comfortable meal when all tables are filled over weekends
4
Great food (some unbelievable dishes), reasonable prices, and a very friendly BYO policy! It has maintained its high quality over the years and its patrons love coming back!
4
Seafood is of very high quality. Most of the dishes we ordered are very tasty and fresh.
Mark up for wine is also very reasonable .. About 20 to 30 percent over market.
Recommended.
5
Is one of my favourite restaurant in Singapore for both tim Sum for lunch and dinner. Great place for wines! They have some interesting selections!
5
for a serious sea food feast or a simple dim sum lunch this place is simply great. Quality food and service.
4
Had Dim Sum with a group of running friends recently. First time to this place at the basement of Forum Galleria. Never knew it existed even though the restaurant had been around for decades. The quality of the dim sum is good - texture of the Har Gao skin is plump and good and not stingy with the prawn fillings. Liked the Liew Sar Pau as well with the creamy flowy salted egg yolk filling. Service staff were polite and courteous and prompt with plate changing. Desserts were served in interesting and innovative presentation. I had the refreshing Lime Sorbet with fruit cocktail
5
I was impressed by the quality of dim sum and enjoyed my lunch thoroughly . The current chef is from Hong Kong so the dim sum was very much Hong Kong style Service staff were attentive & friendly Very observant and plates were changed if dirty Ambience was quiet, classy & elegant Would definitely come back again
4
Great restaurant in S'pore for both lunch and dinner, both Dim Sum and Seafood.The staffs and manager always smile and taking care of their guests really well.They remember my Dad, even his customize orders The only thing I don't like about this restaurant is the air-con, it is a bit too cold so if you have small children remember to bring some jackets with you
3
The first impression that the host gave us wasn't good. She was in a hurry and made us felt like we were bothering her. Food quality was average, there was nothing in particular that stood out. We were there for Dim Sum on a Sunday afternoon. Even the basics like roast pork and charsiew was not good. It was quite disappointing as standards have dropped. Service was fine when we first arrived, but the restaurant soon became packed and it was 90% full. At that point in time, service slowed down and a lot of waiting was required. Our food didn't even come out promptly. All the dim sum were served and after finishing them, Our cooked dishes like the frog legs and noodles were still not here and we waiter for another 15 minutes for it, just drinking tea/water; despite reminding them to check. Overall, it was just disappointing and the restaurant has seen better days. With strong competition these days, you can probably spend the same amount of money and get much better food and service elsewhere
4
Eighteen of us had lunch here. The layout of the restaurant is a little odd, with odd corners and corridors jutting out from each other.But the food is really good. The turbot fish (a kind of flst fish) was freshly killed and was firm and sweet. We had the claypot with chicken and sausage - it was more refined than normal such dishes and did not have too much crispy bits. But they added soup to the remaining rice and it was delicious. We also ordered dim sum classics such as glutinous lotus rice, scallop siew mai, xiaolongbao, BBQ pork bun, csrrot cake, shrimp and scallop rice rolls and fish and chicken congee, Most of these were good, though I did find the rice rolls to be slightly overcooked and very soft.All in all, it was a good meal, and all agreed that we would return.Service was very good, as per any good HK eatery, and the staff were quick to change plates after courses and to refill tea pots
4
We visited Jade Palace on our last night in Singapore, as our local friends brought us there. It was right next to our hotel, and located in the basement of Forum Shopping Centre. The location is really central, and even though it was a weeknight, the restaurant was quite full with patrons, a good sign.Our host treated us to some truly wonderful Hong Kong delicacies, including Claypot fishwing, a few vegetarian dishes, fried frog legs & the delicious Boston Lobster in broth. The service was quite good, and it seems quite popular with the Business crowd, Expats & locals alike.We were there for over 3 hours, and were the second last table to leave just before 11pm
4
Excellent chinese food in Orchard Road. We had the set menu for two, included some great Duck and Chicken, Shanghai fried fish and Lobster tail with noodles, all excellent, quick and polite service too.
4
We have been regular to Jade palace for the last 10 years, whenever we have an oversea visitor or family gathering.Special mention for the sea food, bamboo clams, lobster...and for their dim sum.The are smart to retain their best services staff, very efficient and friendly.The price is a bit on the high side now, but still value for money
5
Located at the basement of Forum shopping centre along Orchard Road, this restaurant has good ambience and isn't too noisy like so many Chinese restaurants here. We visited on a Saturday afternoon and ordered dim sum and other ala carte dishes. Dim sum was good but the selection was quite limited that day possibly because of the Lunar New Year period - the prawn dumplings, siew mai, crispy bean curd skin, Shanghai dumplings and carrot cake were all delicious. The deep fried chilli frog legs with crispy ginger strips was absolutely to die for. This is my second time here, the first was a dinner affair. One of the best Chinese restaurants in Singapore in my opinion.
5
@TheKuoKnowsThe Chinese say that the test of good chefs is whether they can steam fish.Jade Palace does that to perfection, which is the very least you would expect from a restaurant that promotes itself as a destination for seafood.But Jade Palace offers more that just delicacies from the ocean. Its selection of Cantonese food is as broad as the flavours are deep.Its Cantonese roast meats ooze succulence and flavours. They make for a great starter. If you enjoy shellfish, then the lobster on a bed of noodles should more than get your pallet ready for the next course.The choice of live fish is just too many to mention. My personal favourite is the Marble Goby, which is also known as Soon Hock. It's not too pricey too. Simple steaming brings out the freshness of the ocean to a tee.Vegetables are a must, especially the Hong Kong Kai Lan. I like it stir fried in ginger juice.Jade Palace is a haven for food lovers and not just seafood lovers. With plenty of staff on hand, every diner is made to feel like royalty

I was taken to this restaurant by four Chinese business colleagues, the location is just off Orchard Road and it is located in one of the older shopping malls in the area. On entering the restaurant it appears to be an older style restaurant with large tables and a warm welcome. My colleagues were regulars so we quickly ordered some small starters (whitebait, peanuts, crispy pork) all of which were excellent. We then had a series of courses the exact details of which I am not completely clear on a white fish, beef with oyster sauce, lotus soup and vegetable and finally baby lobster with noodles. All the food is Cantonese style cuisine (not always my favourite Chinese region) but is well presented and cooked. The beef in particular was outstanding. The restaurant is busy and appears to have mostly a Chinese clientele; I did not see any tourists. The meal was finished with cake and cookies (I did not partake)So, all in all a creditable Chinese, there is nothing wrong with the whole experience, however, I am not certain that I would come back if I was on my own, but if you are a large group I is ideal
5
This is one of the best Chinese restaurants in Singapore to go for wine dinners. They have a fine wine selection offered at reasonable prices for the quality and if you prefer to bring your own wine, Jade Palace doesn't charge corkage. In fact the service was exemplary - the waiter would provide ice buckets to chill your champagne and serve a new wine glass for each new wine with marking stickers to help you identify which wine you are trying. Best of all the waiter was very experienced in food pairing. Suggesting the right dish that goes so well with the wine selected. Come here for a really enjoyable group wine dinner
5
The last time I had dinner here was in December 2014.I also wrote a review at that time. The food was pretty good, that I told myself we had to return. This time fourteen of us sat in a private room and we had the following.The B-B-Q Cuts comprising pieces of roasted chicken; a fried dumpling; fried white bait and small cubes of roasted pork belly. The fried dumpling was not remarkable, but the fried white bait had a tasty salted batter. The pork belly had a very crispy skin and the skin of the chicken had a delicious smoky flavor. A nice start.Steamed Live New Zealand Oyster with garlic sauce.- An oyster each per person, steamed with a piquant vinegar sauce and garlic that stimulated your taste buds for more things to come!Braised Fish Maw Thick soup with fresh crab meat. Crunchy bits of the maw in a flavorsome rich stock. Another favorite, and a good alternative to the sharks fin dsh that was offered.Roast Duck. Had a very crispy skin, lovely sweet taste with the plum sauce with tender meat and delectable aftertaste. Deep Fried Shanghai Yellow Crocker fish. One fish to each person. The fish was so crispy from the deep frying, that some of us ate parts of the head as well besides most of the crispy bones. Very nicely done and surprisingly not that filling considering the size of the fish.Crispy Lobster tail with salted egg yolk sauce. This had the flavor and aroma of salted egg yolk, and combined with the crunchy texture of the lobster tail, it was delicious.Stir-fried Shanghai “ Xiang Wu Sun” with :Xue Cai”. I was not impressed with this dish. The vegetable itself was not as crunchy as expected and the flavor too subtle. Stewed Noodles with Lobster claw meat. Another “wow” dish. Great texture of the crunchy spring onions and noodles, delicious aromas of the lobster claw and wok frying. Their pickled green chili was so fresh, crunchy and sweet, it added more texture and flavor to each bite.Fresh fruit platter and freshly baked egg tart. Their egg tart is a must try! Bite size portions, so soft and creamy. Freshly out of the oven, it was so very enjoyable. Leaves you wanting more.There’s no corkage for BYO wine. Appropriate wine glasses are supplied for the type of wine you bring. We were served the entire meal by the same waiter, who over the more than two hour dinner, provided us with faultless service, changing plates and refilling the tea and wine glasses. Their attention to detail is remarkable. The first thing I noticed when I sat down at the table was the tooth-pick next to the chop-sticks! In short, excellent service, great tasting Cantonese food, a little on the pricy side, but certainly worth the experience. I will be back to try their famous Clay-pot rice mixed with preserved meats. There’s a toilet located within the restaurant.Established since 1998, tucked in a corner at the basement of Forum, the restaurant is able to seat 150 people and has 6 private dining rooms. The food is traditional Cantonese cuisine with a wide selection of live seafood, dim sum, roast cuts, and their famous traditional clay pot rice with different types of Chinese sausages.There’s an impressive wine list as the restaurant believes strongly in serving good wine with their food.Always packed. Strongly recommended that you make reservations
5
This restaurant at the basement of Forum Galleria is a favourite among Cantonese foodies. Mr Ho the boss recently expanded the dining space following the acquisition of the adjacent store. There's lots of special dishes that are off menu, and you will need the managers to recommend. Roast duck is very good here. There is no corkage for BYO, and the restaurant staff will know how to handle wine dinners as they change glasses for each bottle. For dessert remember to ask for their Lau Sa Pao (steamed yolk custard buns).
5
We came to have a combination of Dim Sum & other dishes for lunch today. The dim sum was pretty decent but it was their other dishes that were excellent. Some of our favourite dishes from today include:- Seafood & Egg Hor Fun, Steamed Prawns, Stir-fried Broccoli with Garlic & Sautéed Sliced Beef with Bitter Gourd.The service was also excellent
5
My extended family and I came here for lunch; having been customers of this restaurant for years, the staff know our preferences. I'd arrived about ten minutes earlier than the rest, and was shown to our table and immediately asked what I'd like to drink. The waiter also enquired if I needed a shawl for my bare shoulders, in case the air conditioning was too strong!We dined in a private room, so it's hard for me to describe the proper ambiance of the restaurant, but it didn't seem overly noisy in the main dining hall either. The wait staff was always on standby to change our plates, and the speed at which the food was served was correct - often in Chinese restaurants it's too fast or too slow!The restaurant is known for its seafood I suppose, but all the other dishes were of top quality too. I found the dim sum here to be of really good standard.If you're looking for excellent Chinese food with great service, don't let the restaurant's basement location put you off. It really is one of the better Chinese restaurants I've dined at in Singapore

Jade Palace Seafood Restaurant is in the Forum the Shopping Mall, off Orchard Road, Singapore. That is a prime location, no view though. Though billed as a seafood restaurant, they offer a variety of meat dishes and, of course, vegetarian food too. The eatery can seat a large number of guests without giving the feeling of clutter. The menu is elaborate. They have set menus as well as a la carte. The food, seafood and meat, is excellent. Obviously, they use fresh produce. Service is very good and efficient. They have an impressive wine list, and they are justifiably proud of it. They do not charge corkage. We, eight of us, had a leisurely dinner and enjoyed every bit of it
4
We'd the SGD 36.8 per pax set lunch. Is pretty good when you're having business meeting as it separates each portion so you don't feel awkward fighting over who eats what. :) It starts with each individual of home made lotus soup, then comes with 3 small dim sum selection. Next a plate of chicken and duck to share (only this is shared). Chicken meat is very tender. Duck is ok. Next an individual large plate of noodle with a huge half lobster! We ended with a very nice mango dessert in a nice glass. I can't fault the quality of their food esp. at such value. I would definitely come back again! oh! we can't help it, we still order their dim sum egg tart - Their serving is very small but boy! The Egg tarts were VERY good
5
My grandaunt has had her birthday party here for years. The staff know her and her family by name, know exactly what she likes, and service is always consistently good.My recommendations: suckling pig, fish maw with sharks' fin soup, steamed whole fish, roast duck, eefu noodles. Each dish is done to perfection. Either no MSG is used or very little because I did not taste any and did not suffer any side effects from the meal.All the staff offer 1st class service, especially to the elderly. Several of my relatives felt very cold and were not prepared for the low temperature. The female staff came with shawls of various sizes and colours for each one to wear.Ray Tan, a young waiter (probably one of the managers, judging by his uniform), was impressive. Multi-lingual and quick to react to every small detail, he served with a smile the whole evening. He went about his job efficiently and to perfection. At the end of the evening as we were leaving, he was at the door to say thank you and bid us goodbye.This is one place I definitely recommend to my friends who ask. Good food, great service, what more do you want out of a restaurant

Had dinner here on my own and enjoyed the food. The service was OK but a little bit cool here & there. Please learn to smile, especially to Westerners else we'll think you're being rude.The place was very busy with local Chinese people; they seemed to like the place so this is a good recommendation.Will I go back... maybe

I have wanted to come to this restaurant for the longest time. Over the weekend, we were looking for a place to dine with my family and I suggested dim sum, which everyone agreed.This restaurant has been at the basement of Forum Galleria Shopping Centre, next to Hilton Hotel for some time. Here are the items that we had:- Har Kau: $5.20 – Steamed prawn dumpling. I find the filling not as plump and juicy as I would have preferred. - Siew Mai: $5.20 – This was alright for me. - Shrimp Cheong Fun: $6 – The soya sauce was light and not too salty. Not bad.- Steamed Prawn & Chives Dumpling: $4.80 – This is something like crystal dumpling. The prawns were cut into cubes and mixed with the chopped chives. Not bad. - Crispy Silver Fish: $8.80 – A staple when I am at a Chinese restaurant. I requested for no chilli because the kids loved this. It was cooked with chopped garlic. - Steamed Custard Cream Bun with Egg Yolk: $4.50 – I wished the bun was steamed longer, as it went luke warm quickly. The salted egg yolk custard was thick and due to the coolness of the bun, meant it solidify quickly. Taste was ok.For weekends, the restaurant has a special dim sum menu in addition to their usual dim sum menu. We ordered a few dishes that caught our eye:- Baked BBQ Bun: $4.50 – Mini char siew Bun. I loved the egg white glaze on the outside of the bun. It imparted a glossy finish to the bun and has a mildly sweet taste.- Steamed Scallop 'Siew Mai': $5 – This was very good. Highly recommended!- Crispy Pork Dumpling: $4.50 – Minced meat in a starchy ball which is deep-fried. This is similar to the Teochew dumpling that I have eaten at another Chinese restaurant. I loved the crunch of the dumpling. Good!- Stir-Fried Shanghai 'Xiang Wu Sun' with 'Xue Cai': $8.80 – This is a tye of leek. But it looked at sliced HK Kailan cut into strips. The vegetable is stir fried with preserved Chinese vegetables. It was my first time eating it, and the leek was crunchy and tasty. Try it!- Durian Glutinous Dumpling: $4.50 – A little disappointed with the size, as it was smaller than a ping pong ball. It also looked deflated. The skin was thin and sticky (sticks to the fork). Wished there was more filling, to justify the price of $1.50 per durian dumpling.The dim sum served here are not bad, and I especially like the weekend-only specials, which are good.I will be back here again to try their ala carte menu soon. The restaurant also has set meals for 2 pax and more. Recommended

This restaurant serves very good quality and I'm willing to say one of the top quality food in town. Service is above average but ambience is ok only. This is a place more to bring family and friends but I would not make this a business venue although I like the food very much. Top food picks are the clay pot rice and the chinese sausages and liver sausage are exquisite

We walked passed the restaurant several times on our way back to the hotel (St.Regis) didn't think much as/and you don't see the restaurant fromStreet level. When we decided one evening we just want to dine nearby and decided to go what a surprise the place was almost full although it's in a "not busy" mall. Mostly locals, happy people, mostly families, good sign!Yes the food was very good. We had rice casserole with salted fish ad garoua filet, sharks fin with crabmeat soup, soya chicken, Kailan vegetables all very good. Service good, price reasonable for the quality

From the outside, Jade Palace Seafood Restaurant does not look like much. However, it has a strong following of regulars given its consistently delicious food. The claypot rice, in particular, is one of the best around town IMO. They also have one of the most impressive selection of wines among the Chinese restaurants in town. BYO is also allowed

We had a dinner at this Restaurant in the private rooms which accommodated six tables. The menu was the Deluxe Seafood Set for 10 people.Roasted whole Suckling pig - was served with flat strips of white soft taco-like wraps, sliced cucumber and cuts of spring onion flavoured and with hoisin sauce. The pig’s skin was neatly cut into thin slices with minimal underlying fat, and the combination of the sweet crispy skin, the spring onion and hoisin sauce with the flat wraps was wonderful in the mouth. We had the double boiled superior abalone soup w/chicken, instead of shark’s fin. This soup had a nice consistency, was not too rich and was well seasoned. Served at a temperature that was not too hot to be consumed, the savour of chicken and abalone, the warmness felt in the throat as the soup went down, was enjoyable.The crispy lobster tail w/salted egg yolk sauce were juicy chunks of the lobster tail, battered with salted egg yolk. You first feel the crunchy lobster meat and then the saltiness and powdery texture of the egg yolk that was marvellously delicious.Return of pig. The carcass of the roasted suckling pig was then served next, having been cut into rectangular pieces.This was not so popular at the table as there was more fat and not as much meat.Steam live Soon Hock fish. The flesh was very fresh, firm and crunchy. Deliciously sweet with the soya sauce and garnishing of spring onion shoots and parsley. Not saltish to taste. A well executed dish. The fish liver was included with the dish.Braised whole South African fresh abalone and mushroom in Oyster sauce. A rather heavy dish with thick oyster sauce. Enjoyed the fresh crispy Kai Lan that came with the dish. The abalone was firm not tough, chewy and slightly saltish. The mushroom was a little soggy with strong earthy flavours.Stir-fried fresh asparagus and fresh lily bulb. Very refreshing, crunchy textures and delightful blend of flavours.Stewed noodle w/lobster claw meat. This was about the best! The crunchy noodles had the strong flavour of lobster with small bits of lobster meat, a hint of smokiness, seasoned nicely and it tasted nice! Fresh fruit platter - comprising Chinese pear, mango and rock melon slices. Served with hot Chinese tea in small tea cups.Cost $1198.00 ++Depending on the dishes offered the Set Menus for a table of ten people have prices ranging from $498.00 to $1198.00 ++. Reviews have placed the average cost at $60.00 to $100.00 per pax. for ala carte items.Ambiance - A Typical Chinese restaurant. No fancy decorations, just cabinets and shelves of wine glasses. Lighting adequate and noise levels can be quite high. The level of customer service and attention was very satisfactory. Wheel chair friendly. Fish tanks at the entrance display the live sea food items available, although to me, some of the creatures in the tanks look almost unpalatable!There’s a toilet located within the restaurant.Established since 1998 this restaurant, tucked in a corner at the basement of Forum, is able to seat 150 people and has 6 private dining rooms. The food is traditional Cantonese cuisine with a wide selection of live seafood, dim sum, roast cuts, and their famous traditional clay pot rice with different types of Chinese sausages.There’s an impressive wine list as the restaurant believes strongly in serving good wine with their food, and a no corkage policy.Always packed. Strongly recommended that you make reservations.583, Orchard Road#B1-13 FORUM THE SHOPPING MALLSINGAPORE 238884.Open: Mon - Sun: 11am - 3pm, 6pm - 11pmTel: 67326628Fax:67359968

Ambience is noisy and the décor a little tired looking but ignore all that - The food is fresh, delicious and very reasonably priced!Sweet and sour pork, fresh steamed prawns, sea cucumber, claypot rice with liver lapcheong, noodles with shallots.Service is prompt and helpful. A very satisfying meal

Jade palace is our family's favorite!! Good food especially the seafood selection. One thing to mention. They do not have any corkage charge for your wine you brought in.

i was a bit disappointed as the restaurant had been highly recommended. the quality of the food did not justify the price-- excellent wine list- good service

Good service. Wide variety of dimsum. Fresh seafood. Steamboat option. BYO+no corkage. What more can I say...

Great authentic Chinese food in Singapore - one of the ones frequented by loads of Hong Kongers. Always reliable and good quality.
5
I must say that this is not your typical Chinese restaurant. All dishes are were tasty but I couldn't feel the MSG. All the food were neither too salty or too sweet. Just nice. The Dim sum were well made. Fried Rice was perfect. Chicken ligament with salted egg was awesome. One of their specialty was the clay pot rice which is only for diner and it was the best I have tasted. Service was excellent as we went with a friend who was a regular. All in all it is a well prepared food and I will come back here. The food felt and tasted CLEAN would be a very good way of putting it

Was here for dim sum with my family and I must say, they have maintained the standard. Feeling adventurous, ordered the ducks tongue and pigs ear. The pigs ears were nice and flavourful. However, the tongue is too "flavourful" for my liking though. As for the rest of the dim sum, they were great, tasty and delicate. Great service as well

I've been dining at Jade for many years, and the reason my family and I keep going back is because this is the best Cantonese fine dining in town. Unpretentious, authentic, traditional Cantonese dishes only Hong Kong chefs know how to whip up. And the quality of the food there has been consistent through so many years. Better yet, they don't charge corkage when you bring your own wine. It's how confident they are that you're there for the food that they want you to enjoy your wine without penalizing you

Attentive service,consistently above average food, reasonable prices, always.Reservations a must!3 of us, a Singaporean with 2 dear European friends had Chinese steak, eggplant, green veggies in stock, after the appetisers of thinly sliced pork trotters, ~ braised slice beef and crispy silver fish!Our conversation was very serious - about Russian aggression in Ukraine, nevertheless, we enjoyed the dinner and time together!The restaurant is elegant but it is always packed and therefore noisy at times.Wonderful extensive menu of favorites from my childhood, so homespun dishes of claypot rice, steamed eggs, Chinese steak to banquet foods. Also always good wines at moderate prices. You can sit there from early in the evening, eating appetisers and drinking wine - tapas style

Only the discerning will know this restaurant is one of the few to cook good old Cantonese cuisine the right way. Similar to the restaurants in Hong Kong, the entrance of Jade Palace is lined with tanks and tanks of live seafood. Flip open the menu and feel yourself transported to Hong Kong. A wide variety of choices and some which are not found in other Cantonese restaurants.The stir fried black pepper wagyu beef cubes were excellent. While chunky, they were so tender to the bite. I love that the beef cubes are not smothered in sauce but skillfully coated with a thin layer. The subtle taste of black pepper does not overwhelm the meat hence the beef still tastes of...beef! The claypot prawn glass noodles with shrimp roe is another winner. Succulent fresh prawns sauteed, added flavour to the originally bland glass noodles. Every single strand of glass noodle was generously coated with shrimp roe, which makes it all the more tastier. While I prefer my cod steamed rather than fried, the chef had done a great job in deep frying this piece of cod to a crispy perfection. The inside of the fish is still tender and moist while the skin was crispy. Jade Palace remains one of my favourite Chinese restaurants of all times. While the price is on the high side, but given the quality of ingredients and skill of the chef, its worth every penny. No wonder its also a haunt of many Japanese expatriates

A secret place where wine lovers all over Singapore gather for fine Cantonese cuisine. Great stemware and staff are well trained in wine service. Great wine list with mainly French labels with very reasonable prices. BYO is encouraged and there is no corkage charges. Food is excellent if you know what to order. Dishes that are a must try include the following:Roast Suckling Piglet (Pre-order is required)Crispy Braised Beef Brisket Roast DuckDeep Fried Frogs Legs with Crispy Ginger ChipsPrawn with Thai Glass NoodlesBraised Fish with Bean Curd and Bitter GourdClaypot Rice with Chinese Sausage and preserved meatsPrices are comparable to any fine continental fine dining restaurant. At around $120 per person without wine.Reservations is advised as they are usually full on most dinners and on weekends

We selected a few dishes and the server looked like he was trying to better define how they would best be served. These changes tripled the bill. While what we got was good, it wasn't worth 200 S$

i travelled here with my family complete. they really love the dishes chinese dimsum and some soups its all meets our requirement. a bit expensive for us actually.

Perhaps a bit hidden away, but a good thing as only local know it. Very few tourist every make it here, but what an experiance!
Well done, very good service and excellent wine list and service with the most amazing food options.
A real find

Jade Palace was recommended to us by a foodie? We booked a table, got there and right away there were problems, they showed us to a table and then we were told that it was not our table, back to receptiion to sort it out in the end we got our table. The staff were very attentive, I was bought up on asian food and asked for Dim Sums told not served at night only in the day ok, placed our order and waited. The starters came (soup) and straight away one of the mains closely followed by the second. The third arrived about 20 minutes later after asking twice where it was. Advice don't have a bottle of wine the house wine is a lot nicer. We ate a lot in China town and this was the best place to eat. Will be going back to Singapore but to Jade Palace

I visited this restaurant with recommendation from my Singaporean local friends. It was really great in fact. Not those of high end type. But foods were nice and in good size portion, staffs were attentive. Really fantastic in overall. I would surely go back if I have a chance

Visited the Jade Palace in the Forum Shopping Centre at the top of Orchard Road with a business colleague. We did not plan to go here but found it while searching for some seafood. It is in the basement floor of a shopping centre and is nothing to look at from the exterior....don't be put off. The style is Cantonese with a seafood speciality (but there are plenty of non-seafood dishes). Service was reasonable and after placing our order, the food flowed.....we selected seafood mostly but added some Chinese vegetables and sweet and sour pork for contrast. All excellent food, delicately flavoured rather than overpowered with spices. Only downside is I thought it was relatively expensive....but we did eat a lot and some of the seafood dishes were a little extravagant. All in all an enjoyable experience with good food

It's tucked away in the lower level of a small shopping complex. It certainly was worth looking for as their fish is very good. Most of it is live and could probably see you entering the restaurant! It is no expensive although they have a very limited wine list which IS quite expensive. Service is very good, friendly an efficient

You need to reserve and in foodaholic Singapore that should tell you something. Fresh seafood, range of good teas and the clatter of nearly every Chinese restaurant. Fresh seafood -choose live if you wish- and very good dim sum with a wine-friendly policy. If you dont bring your own, there is a small yet smart wine selection. A buzzy place to enjoy but don't think romantic serenity as you are in a shopping mall on the main shopping road with related rents and costs. Chomp on

This restaurant is smart yet comfortable for a family with a baby, all very welcome and looked after impeccably . The dim sum was very good and inexpensive . There are a lot of staff to look after the diners, the presentation is probably a bit better than thecquality of traditional dim sum as this is dim sum in a really nice restaurant . This is not to criticise but to point out the difference between this very attractively presented restaurant and, say, a traditional dim sum place with trolleys etc where the surroundings may be opposite but quality often better. We liked it, will go back particularly when in Orchard Road area as is is quite possibly the best lunchtime experience in the heart of tourist area. Three eating no alcohol lots of good food less than 50 dollars

This is your typical Chinese restaurant frequent by locals. The ambience is good and with lots of people. Booking is encouraged and weekends are packed. Try the fish skins, cold crabs, porks dishes & chicken cartilages. Generally, food is great and comparable to restaurants in Hong Kong.Prices are expected to be higher but it is worth it. Really enjoyed it and definitely will become my regular joint in Singapore
