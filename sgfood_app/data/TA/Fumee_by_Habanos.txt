The food was excellent. There were a couple of one for one promotions on food and drinks with good value.
The one for one wine was pretty good: the ambience was quite nice and the servers were courteous. You must come visit.
4
We both had a hamburger and chips and they were very tasty and succulent. Service attentive and band fun to listen to.
4
Quality of food was great for the price we paid. Service was prompt. Had a very pleasant experience there.
4
Breezy and chill place located near all the offices hence the convenience!
Food as usual was great, somehow alittle on the salty side this time.
Nonetheless still fun!
5
definitely a ideal drinking place with friends! the staff provided helpful recommendation to our liquor choices.
4
The serving was big with generous fries to along with the steak. The 1-for-1 steak promo was fantastic and it was good quality beef steak. We enjoyed the family atmosphere and the decent service.
1
We were staying in the nearby Pan Pacific, looking to eat out close to the hotel, wished we hadn't bothered. Service was so bad three of us had consumed our food before the last dish arrived. Our complaints to the management ended with an offer of a free drink to compensate! needless to say we left without accepting the offer, never to return!!Disappointed

Chilli soft-shell crab linguine has a little twist of Singaporean flavour in an italian style. A fusion that brings joy in my heart. Roast chicken with mac and cheese is tasty but not the best I've had. However, the chicken skewers are flavourful and juicy. This is the best amongst the items we have ordered
3
Saw the 1for1 sirloin promotion and booked it. Since it's a new restaurant for me, such promotion is always the key. However, when I was there, the sirloin was said to be sold out. Disappointed since I'm here for beef, I went for their next choice of beef, ribeye 1for1 which was nearing double the price. I do feel abit scammed. Food was good but wouldn't be worth visiting if there's no 1for1. Service need to buck up
2
We booked via chope which had a one for one sirloin promo. Apparently when we reached the restaurant we were told that sirloin was out of stock. Restaurant did not have decency to inform guest. We ended up with some ribeye which was really mediocre. Midway through the meal the sewage burst and the stench was really terrible, and it totally spoilt the whole dining experience. First and last time at this place.
5
Good atmosphere for couples having a dinner or lunch out. We ordered their 1 for 1 sirloin which came to us pretty fast and the taste was decently good. Would visit again.
5
sam’s service was great! he was very friendly when we asked for the wifi and the washroom directions.
3
Ambience and price was good. The steak was very thin but overall very worth it.
Would try other options on the menu next time.
5
Good food with good ambient. this is the third visit and each visit i have different variety of food. consider a wide selection of burgers, with description well detailed. this place is worth the visit!
5
Fumee is a really nice restaurant with nice promos such as one for one for chicken avocado sliders at just $12++. I got the chicken chop 1 for 1 and it was so crispy and flavourful! I topped up $4 for roasted mushrooms
5
Very cheaper bear 1 for 1 And I enjoyed a lot as well as live band. So the SAM is very good server. His smile attracts me towards the restaurant. His service is eye catching for me thanks a lot SAM.
5
Check out the lunch deals they have, very reasonable and of very good quality and the price is right! In the evening it is fun to listen to the band enjoy a nice beverage, their wine selection is very decent, the by the bottle prices for other beverages are reasonable and they always have a special and they can keep your bottle for you, but likely hood is that you will finish it with your friends. Their steaks and burgers are of good quality too and charcuterie platter is enjoyable too. Occasional wine dinners are nice in price and quality too. Cigars of course are world class. Overall a nice multi concept place to visit and certainly with friendly staff and proprietors walking around to be of service
1
We tried the 1-for-1 oysters and 1-for-1 steak promotion for lunch. The oysters were way too cold and was very bland. The steak was so-so - thin and a tad chewy. Husband and I both had upset tummies in the late afternoon. Needless to say, we will not be returning.
5
We enjoyed the chicken steak and their service is great. The other dish we ordered was the chilli crab linguini and it could have been better if the sauce had been spicier and less sweet. However the waitress wasnt too sure about showing us to our reserved seats when we arrived even though I had the booking confirmation from the Chope app.
4
The place looked like a deli from outside with its rows of cheese on the counter. Walked inside one could not help but wow at the collection of wines and other drinks over the bar counter. For Wednesday night, there was also live band available. Order was taken through ipad. Looking through the menu, it had quite a number of 1-for-1 item during supper hours.Power Plank ($48++, usual price $55++)Oriental Ribs, Sirloin Steak, Mini Wagyu Patty, Chicken Steak, Chicken Skewers, Wasabi Mayonnaise FriesThe mini patties were so cute looking which I mistook them as meatballs. This platter was a must order for meat lovers which we demolished it in no time.Blue Cheese Burger ($20++)Wagyu Patty (Doneness : Medium), Blue Cheese Sauce, Bacon, Caramelised Onion, Roma Tomato, Cajun FriesThe sweetness of the caramelised onion went quite well with the moist juicy patty, but the blue cheese sauce was a bit too overwhelming. Chicken Mac & Cheese ($24++)Succulent chicken served over spatzle & cheeseInstead of the usual macaroni, spatzle which was a kind of soft egg noodle found in the cuisines of southern Germany, was used here. Not sure why, the dish was more on the sweet side, instead of usual savoury flavour which one expected from Mac & Cheese.Mushroom Risotto ($22++)Roasted Mushroom, Puree of Roasted Mushroom, Parmesan Cheese, Carnaroli RiceThe simple looking dish was well cooked with earthy flavours of the mushrooms in the mouth.The restaurant would be having a 3-course set meal($38++) for the month of December, which consisted of a choice of Appetizer, a choice of Main Course and a choice of Dessert.For Appetizer, there would be Butternut Squash Soup,Smoked Salmon Gravlax, The slices of smoked salmon was decorated like a rosette which made it too pretty to be eaten. Lightly and refreshing.Foie Gras SaladIt was a good balance between the buttery pan fried foie gras, the sweetness of the fruit and crispiness of the vegetables.For Main Course, Prime Rib with Roasted Pumpkin & Chestnut,The brownish pile of braised chestnut offered a surprising sweet and nutty flavour which interesting to go with the tender juicy meat.Chicken Roulade & Silky MashAlthough looking much plainer comparing to the other main course, the dish held itself quite well.For Dessert,Toffee Pudding,The pudding reminded one of sticky date pudding, which was moist and served with toffee and cream sauce. Personally one would prefer it to be served hot with a scoop of ice cold vanilla ice cream by the side.Christmas CakeThe cake looked like a slice of log cake, served with slices of strawberries. It tasted like coffee sponge with oreo filling.Another upcoming dish in December would be the Seafood Platter, which consisted of half lobster topped with crispy parmesan crusted minced garlic , seafood couscous and pollock fish. For seafood lovers, the couscous would be the favourite as it filled with lots of juicy seafood such as prawns, mussels, clams, and calamari rings. The pollock was interestingly served on top of soften slices of potato

Jag was our server and provided outstanding services.He was extremely professional and friendly.His services exceed our expectation.
4
Excellent food and cheap beers around that area. With friendly staff and cosy environment.I wouldn’t mind dropping by every after work for my happy hour.😀
Big cheers to you guys
5
Good food, cheap beers and most importantly, good service from the waiter, sam. He is very attentive and always making sure things are in place. :)
5
The best fish and chips ever and the Wagyu burgers are a must. There are so many great places to eat in Singapore but if you are near the Marina or Millenia Walk, you must stop in for a beer and some sliders.
5
Nice enviroment, nice food to relax. Good place to chill with beer n food.
Nice service by a waiter Sam. Helpful!!!
5
My husband and I decide to have a simple lunch together. We decided to dine at Fumee without a second thought. Indeed same experience we had before, food was so great and really up to our expectations. Staff are well attentive and look after us. Jag is the one who attend to us and recommend their offerings that is really value for money. We will surely keep on coming back. Keep it up Fumee and kudos to Jag for rendering an excellent service as always
5
Iâ€™m very happy with the service here , I can say that this restaurant has great offer for the wines ! Food was awesome as usual , but most importantly , all the staffs are so friendly ! And Thankyou mr.jag for making our day 
5
Hello. Please give our thanks to the Manager(s) , especially Jag and others for the wonderful service and bottle of sparkling wine for our birthday celebration. We had an amazing time. The restaurant was so comfortable, the food was absolutely spectacular (we ate two meals there). Our waitress was just wonderful. Looking forward to dine again with friends in the future. What a great place!
2
We were initially excited with the 1-For-1 mains promotion and ordered Port Ribs and Lobster pasta. Hence it came with two ribs and two lobster pasta. You can imaging how terrible we felt to finish the aged and tasteless pork ribs in order not to waste food. Then it worsen when the lobster was served. It was not only dry and unfresh, but also smelly. I am not sure if the beef steak will be as bad as the pork rib and lobster. But have no intention to return there.
5
I work near the area so my colleagues and I hit this place often. Sam always somehow ends up serving us. Recently a colleague left something of value behind, thought he lost it for good. We came back for drinks a few days and found out Sam kept it safe for us. Make sure you get served by this guy. Kudos
5
Having just landed in Singapore we happened to visit this bar and met a lovely young barman named Sam. So friendly ,gave great advise on their beer selection
He has a lovely way about him tourist will adore him. Good luck in your future Sam
5
Sam is a great waiter! Food was lovely! Ordered all on a ipad so service was super quick and easy. Would definitely recommend this to others👌🏻😍😊
3
Took the HGW deals for a group of 22 to dine there. Much fried foods on the planks. Grilled ribeye is the most acceptable. 2 bottles of red set us back by SGD400.
4
Great service. Good food, seasoned perfectly. Would recommend stopping for a kronenbourg and one of their planks to anyone.
5
I went to Fumee a lot of times and I have to say the place is great! The prices are very reasonable for Singapore and I just love their 1 for 1 steak promotion. The food and service is really good. Our waiter Sam is always pleasant and friendly and we never have to wait for him to come if we need anything. I hate when in some restaurants you have to wave at the waiter and it takes him 5 minutes to even notice you are there. Sam is always looking at customers and immediately comes when you want to order. I highly recommend this place!
5
In general, Fumée offered up good food, service and atmosphere on the Sunday night of our visit. Our table of 17 ordered a starter of 2 dozen oysters, some sides which included truffle fries and mushrooms, mains - red meats mostly, and a cheese board of 8 varieties.Sam, the staff who probed us to leave a review on this page, well-deserves this mention for being prompt and attentive, waiting on our table with patience and a pleasant disposition. This isn't to say the other staff were lacking, for they too, were very patient with our requests. The manager himself was very accommodating when we requested to shift our already-prepped spot to the al fresco area with no fuss. It definitely helped that Sunday evenings are times where many would opt to eat in or at places closer to home. Fumée wasn't quite entirely packed so we were able to enjoy time here with the laid-back atmosphere of the area.
4
Pop in for a quick beer with my girlfriend service from angilina and Sam was fantastic big smiles made us feel welcome . So with that we came back as we felt so comfortable . Sam and angilina remembered us which is so important theses guys were great had wonderful night good live band food and beer . Good job guy's 
5
After flying from Maldives.. and time difference ...we checked into hotel then ventured out for a late dinner .. it was around 10.30 pm so not a lot still operating at this hour in this vicinity so it was a plus to find out we could order food and drink at this late hour.. and they had a special of 2 meals for one so we ordered the pork ribs with fries.. and a cold beer ....sooo delicious.. melt in your mouth tasty ribs with a pot of spicy rib sauce on the side.. my truffle fries were delightful. So crunchy ! A live band was playing and it was a fabulous end to a long day !!
3
Food was average only. We ordered medium rare steak but the steak was very tough. Would not pay the price for the quality of food if not for entertainment app. Had the soft shell chilli crab linguine...felt that the standard was average as well. The crabmeat was generous but it does not have the chilli crab taste. Was disappointed with the food. Maybe it’s just our selection of foo.
2
I just had dinner with my friends at Fumee. We ordered 4 medium-rare sirloin steaks but what came was 2 medium-well and 2 well-done steaks.Although what we ordered were 1-for-1 deals, this should not be the reason to cook steaks like you do not care.Neither the steaks had colour nor taste. Worst of all, they came with Japanese wasabi on the side. What???!I should have told them about the food I got and request to change but I did not. Well, I was afraid of getting "extra" ingredients on my food if I did.Absolutely horrible food
3
Tried Fumee for the first time as Chope had a 1-for-1 promotion. Ambient was great, but the beef was so-so.
5
Excellent service! Value for money. Oysters at fantastic! Definitely will return with friends !
Beef was juicy and tasty.
5
Value for money and great service rendered by staff. Oysters were amazing and there was 1 for 1 on a few dishes!
3
Came back here today for lunch. This time we opted for one of the 1:1 lunchtime steak deals: Angus rib-eye for about $50 all in. Steak was good but had a bit too much fat for my liking. Fast and efficient service. Some seeded mustard would be good. But overall quite good value for a steak.
3
I enjoyed the relaxed atmosphere at Fumee. It's located at a quiet corner right next to the taxi stand of Millenia Walk.The staff did a pretty great job with their service and smiles. They were very attentive. There was live music on the Friday we went. They had some 1-for-1 and we had the oysters for that - very juicy and fleshy - love love love. The rest of the food: cheese platter, spaghetti and hot wings were just ok - nothing to shout about. We hanged around and ordered some red wine - very decent. This is the place to go to for Jap whisky - huge range. We'll go back again and try other food on their ipad menu.
4
It was a Friday night and we needed a quick after work dinner fix before hitting the night hence we decided to try this restaurant and bar place out.The service was pleasant, wagyu burger was juicy and tasty and the jim beam high ball that we ordered at a promotional rate was great. From a quick dinner fix to a hearty tasty dinner - Fumee exceeded our expectations in every way possible and will surely come back again soon.
3
Ordered a medium rare steak but received medium well instead. Feedback to staff and dish was brought back to kitchen but it was returned and insisted that doneness was correct. Tried the venue coz of Chope promotion. Good deal if you are not particular with food quality
2
Decided to try after reading a food blog. It turned out it was a terrible. Main was served before the appetizers and checked with the manager and got a reply the kitchen was busy. The food was not good and the server are just walking around blindly. 4 of us and only gave us 3 side plates and u need to ask for the missing one. It seem like they lack training. If u just want a drink it is ok. Better place for food and drink in that area.
3
Disorganised. Came during lunch time and lunch sets were not ready. Waitress told us it was available but manager and someone else said it wasn't. Only available after we said someone told us otherwise. Ordered Angus ribeye and asked for medium rare. Came Medium-well done. But they replaced the plate. Expensive given the service and food. Fries were good
1
Very disappointing experience; our 3 Gin Tonics for SGD70 were simply disgusting with no bubbles at all in the tonic (must have been a very old tonic). On our request to exchange the 3 gin tonics the waiter simply replied he could not do so and this would be how the gin tonic tastes here. We all know very well how gin tonic is supposed to taste. I can really not recommend this place
4
With no expectation, booked here very last minute for a casual dinner. Turned out to be a good one, both food and service are good.
4
Nice new restaurant slightly away from the typical routes of human traffic. Went for the 1-for-1 steak promotion. The service level as well as food presentation were impeccable. Food was decent though not outstanding.
4
Nice ambient, but went at peak period which led to slower service. The live band was a good touch, but was a little too loud to the point i had to raise my voice to have a conversation.
4
Nice ambience and comfort food on a Friday night with live music. Be sure to request for a seat slightly further from the stage as it can get quite loud.
4
Food was excellent and reasonable. Only if they didn't put those bottled water on the table that are chargeable.
5
The oysters were very fresh! Totally enjoyed every bit of it! We had the Angus beef. It was nice and tender and was cooked according to what we have requested.
4
Food was yummy, and the environment was stylish yet comfortable. Accordingly, the price also reflects that.
4
Convenient location and nice ambience. Order and payment can be made via iPad. Got the steak at 1 for 1 promo. Very good deal!
4
Had the 1 for 1 lunch steak which was served surprisingly quickly but nonetheless was enjoyable. Topped up with truffle fries which were decent nothing too fantastic, but the foie gras was forgettable. Overall excellent value.
3
This place has pretty fast service for food! We had the ribeye steak, Mac and cheese and mushroom soup. I liked how the ribeye was served with a knob of Wasabi on the side. Overall food was average, no particular standouts. I didn't like the fact that sauces were provided in individual sachets. Although more hygienic, it reminded me of a fast food joint for takeout.
5
Good service, so was the food. Get the promotion items for an even greater deal. Will definitely be back again!
4
Booked through Chope app for the restaurant. Food and beer is not bad especially when there was 1 for 1 for the steak!
4
Sparkling wine was nice and affordable. Food was so-so. Was served by Angeline who was really warm, friendly & helpful with her recommendations.
Will definitely go back again.
5
Good place to have a yummy burger. I stayed at the Pan Pacific Hotel and it is a 1-2 minute walk to get there. It also adjoins the shopping centre.
3
Popped in here for a steak for lunch today. Quite tasty and served efficiently. This place never seems that busy at lunchtime so no problem getting a table.
4
With the one for one steak, its really value for money as each set cost about $25 after GST and Service Charge. Do order your steak Medium to get the best average done-ness as the thickness of the steak can be quite uneven. No complains for this price though. :D They have happy hour promotions for beers and wine and serves cigars too! Whaaat? Overall, we had a good experience at this place and would recommend anyone who likes a pocket friendly steak + chill out dinner as they have live music of Wed and Fri. What's not to love?
3
Overall ambience was rather dark but didn't bother us. However, it would be an issue for some. Staff seemed rather inexperienced but tried their best. The iPad ordering system wasn't terribly intuitive and it seemed that the wait staff had to help every table with the ordering. We both ordered the lunch set menu. I chose the soup which was frankly rather disappointing. The main course was a pasta with sliced beef tenderloin. The beef ended up over cooked. My friend has steak which he seemed to enjoy. Overall, for what you pay it's ok. Probably more a place for evening drinks rather than a meal.
4
Family enjoyed the well-executed 141 Ribeye platters, and our kids declared the crispy fries better than MacD! Canadian oysters for $26 /12 is unbeatable value. And couldn't resist the icey ice cold Beer @$49/ 3L. Salad selection not impressive. Our second visit in 6 months; service is friendly
4
It was our first time at the restaurant and we were quite happy with the variety of food on the menu. There were also promotions available - 1-for-1 on selected items, 25% off All Day Dining items or kids-eat-free (pick any one of the promo, not to be used together). We found prices pretty reasonable and the food was tasty too
4
Indoor seating was slightly too cold for comfort. However, the restaurant offered comfortable alfresco dining place. The Wagyu beef burger certainly lived up to its name of being one of the best! Had the blue cheese burger for the second time and indeed it was one of the better blue-cheese burgers
4
Whether it is with family or business associates, this place has different seating arrangements to suit all. Live bands are there from Wed-Fri. Food portions are generous.
4
Crayfish pasta tasted good, crayfish grilled to perfection and generous serving of fish roe. Mentaiko fries was awesome, generous serving of mentaiko. Laksa pasta was not worth a try. Price on the high side.
5
Mediterranean style with a huge selection of cheese and charcuterie. Wide selection of wine from all over the world. The menu is really interesting. Service polite and friendly.
5
This is one of my favorite place in Downtown, exceptional food and a very good Wine selection to match
4
Met one of my staff at Fumee for a discussion over lunch. Ordering from the iPad was simple enough. The wait staff accommodated my request to sit at a high table (I just like sitting at high tables). We both ordered a lunch special. I chose the beef wagyu penne and had a salad as a starter. The salad was tossed nicely and simple. Taste wise was fine - a simple suggestion would be spice it up a little by putting some garnishing on it. The beef wagyu penne was also fairly good. Could have done with a bit more salt (but guess less salt is good for me). Overall pleasant experience and I will be back
5
We came across this place as we were staying at the Pan Pacific next door.We visited every day ( 6 days), either for drinks and twice for food.We had very good service, especially from Jag, who gave us information on Singapore and general chit chat.We liked the fact they had tables outside where we could have a smoke and our drinks.The drinks special of 2 Carafe for the price on 1 was a bargain in an expensive city.Please send Jag our regards and thank him for his friendliness
4
Came by chance because of the Entertainer. We were very impressed by the ribeye, and even more so with the (cheaper) sirloin. Nicely done and tender. The risotto and fish and chips were pretty average though. Nice place to chill with the selection of beers and wines, and live band. Will be back, for the steak. :)
4
I was at this great place Fumee at Millenia Walk having Wine Pairing Dinner and it was fantastic. I love the ambience of the restaurant which also has a nice outdoor chill out place. The menu is awesome and the Chef has done a great job pairing the food with the wines. Most of all friendly service staff led by Raj Sadhawni. Thank you Raj
2
We had a burger lunch at Fumee. This place looks ok. Nothing special. We ordered couple of burgers with french fries. Chicken burger had really strange taste and the beef burger was just ok. French fries were simply awful. I don't like to order food by using pad. I would not eat here again, but I could surely come here for a few cold beers and to watch EPL soccer which they do show
2
This is our 2nd time to Fumee.. The first visit was divine but yesterday, 15 April was a night with poor service. Husband ordered his meal and I ordered catch of the day at 846pm. While his meal came in minutes, nearly 915pm.. Mine had not arrived. We informed the waitress Cherlyn who apologized and my meal came out by 920pm. ( my husband had already almost finished his meal) The waiter said voluntary that the leader would be offering us a discount. Upon reaching the counter, we whipped out our entertainer app and the lady there flatly replied no discount if using app. The waiter even approached her and told her we were to get a discount . We really didn't want or need a discount. Paying full service charge for very poor service was not ideal but we just told the staff there that we just wanted to make a point.. WorstServiceEver. We don't want your discount. We wanted to have an enjoyable dinner and to all couples out there, avoid this place if you can. As an owner of a bridal site, I cannot reinforce further the importance of pleasing customers. Going the extra mile is good, leaving customers with a bitter taste- completely unacceptable.
4
Friend and I were there on a Friday evening, first impression at entrance was well created by the svr crew. Food wise..we liked the mains which we ordered, fried pasta and burger. Live band in Fri evening too..
5
Friendly staff and very well cooked and seasoned steaks. 2nd time here, and they didn't disappoint. Keep it up :) :)
4
Popped in over a couple of times during our stay, was a busy little bar with food and dining options. Well priced and service with a smile.
5
We had a nice lunch here. The staff was attentive and showed us to our table very quickly. We placed the order via the ipad they gave us. The food was quick and well done. We had a great time here! We also ordered beer that was extremely cheap in singaporean standards ! Try out this place if you have a chance
4
Fumee is the place for the younger ones to hang out; though I didn't feel out of place at all. The band was good & added to the feel-good ambience of the place.The food was good for its price. We started with the parma ham with burrata; it was yummy and brought our hopes up for a good main. Two of us had the rib-eye steak which was going 1-for-1; it was good & sufficiently large. The fries was good too. What was a let down was the pasta; nothing to rave about. One of us ordered the fish & chips & commented that the one at Sxxx was better. Service was friendly, good and helpful.There is an outdoor seating area if you want to see the cars go back. It also feels less closed-in as compared to seating on the inside. Choice is a matter of preference.Will probably be back to try their burgers & chicken rice
5
This bar was right beside our hotel and I'm so glad it was. We visited here both nights we were in Singapore.When you sit down you are given a mini iPad to order your food and drink, within seconds are drinks arrived at our table. We had burgers one night and they were delicious.The staff were attentive, friendly and welcoming. There was a private party there and we were invited to join. The people there were very friendly.I loved my two nights there and I would highly recommend a visit. If I ever return to Singapore I would visit there again. I loved it and it was reasonably price
4
This restaurant is conveniently located at Millenia Walk. It is a restaurant, bar and a whisky bar all rolled into one. The meats and cold cuts are delicious. There's a spacious outdoor sitting area. It was nice during the day, and should be even nicer in the evenings
3
Went for a late lunch and ordered the wagyu burger (with a double patty). I have no complaints. However, my 'beef' with the restaurant lies in the oysters that they served. They were small and did not taste as fresh as they ought to be. Please request for a sample before ordering a dozen like I did
5
Nice place to chill out after work with friends or colleague and their food is good for sharing. Try the starters and their desserts!
3
Came here for lunch earlier in the week and opted for the double Wagyu burger. This was decent enough but the fries which came with it were a bit dry: some sauce would have been good. Not too busy at lunchtime so no reservation was required
5
Very nice place with good food (we tried burger, garlic shrimps and some salads, sparkling vines), average prices and good live music. The manager (Vincent, I guess?) is a very nice person. We will certainly visit this place next time we're in Singapore!
5
First visit to Fumee at Millenia Walk. Had a meat platter and other dishes. The beef was juicy & tasty. One of the best fish & chips we've tasted.
5
Nice food, nice environment, especially the manager Vincent. Always have a great time after drop by. Thank Vincent for the services.
5
Shoutout to my man Vincent who turns bartendering into a form of art.
Tip: request for custom cocktails
4
We had a thoroughly decent evening meal at Fumee, the menu isn't massive but they do good burger and decent steaks, and some nice pasta, they have a pretty good wine list and the service was great.There was absolutely nothing to gripe about here. Would recommend it as a cheaper dining and drinking option than the nearby hotels
4
A surprising change from the old tenantPicked this place for the 1-4-1 Entertainer App deal. I must say its a very good chill out ambience, with the semi alfresco (not enclosed but air conditioned) set up adding to the vibe. Service was efficient and friendly, altho the tables can be a bit short on elbow space. But good service experience.Food wise, the osysters were really fresh! But the guy who was shucking them at the back must be having a really tough time - we had crushed oyster shells mixed with the fleshy blobs and it was hard to enjoy them as usual. Steaks were good and done-ness executed nicely. Sides of sambal squid waas quite tasty too.Would definitely return:)
1
WE NEVER EVEN GOT TO EAT! was looking for a nice dinner on saturday evening, saw fumee on entertainer seemed to occupy where the old Medz was, decided to give it a try. Reached the restaurant around 7:20, before our 7:30 reserrvation. The place didn't look very full. we ordered 2 ice lemon teas, one chili crab fries, one pasta, and one burger. By 8:10, nothing had come except for the ice lemon tea (which we also didn't know the price at the time). Asked the waitress about our food, she said 3 minutes. Finally, a couple minutes later our chili fries came out - soggy, cold, disgusting. We got up to leave, chili crab fries untouched, no mood to eat or wait for the mains already. The manager still had the nerve to charge us the fries, and the two drinks. Turns out ice lemon tea is $7 a pop, crazy. And the staff hardly seemed remorseful at all. apparently they think its normal to wait half an hour for cold soggy food. no attempt to make things right to at least try to retain us to come back again for a second try.Will never never ever come here again.btw 8:40 now, super starving, but finally sat down at the Plentiful restaurant just down the hall. Now, THAT is good food, quick, and great service. So, if you want a great meal for around same price, i highly recommend there instea
5
The bar experience at Fumée is one of a kind for a restaurant bar. Thumbs up to the Bar Manager, Vincent! He crafts drinks to your request and and produces a concoction of quality. Unlike other restaurant bars, Fumée's decor and unique collection of bar stocks sets it apart. Like its availability of unusual flavouring syrups, mixers and condiments at the bar. I would surely come back again for this one of a kind experience
5
It was a lovely night spending in Fumee. Me & my friends enjoyed it so much & we decided to come back again. Oysters were awesome. Wagyu beef, blue cheese burger, garlic prawns, truffle risotto were mouth watering... I love the kind of music the band plays. Not to forget selection of wines, cocktails were great. Staff were attentive. It's a pleasure to see my friend Mr. Vincent Yong in his signature suit. I should say it's a 2 thumbs up for my overall experience in Fumee. 5 star -Excellent!!
5
This was a culinary and wine surprise. The concept is fresh... Everyone homemade and high quality ingredients. Had the roasted rib... Was so good came back again the very next night. Wine was recommended by the wine expert and the selections were fantastic. Live miso was great (to my surprise) and the vibe was lively.I wasn't sure what to expect but wow... Try this out. Was fantastic for us two nights in a row!The owner is fascinating.... Ask for Helen by name and she will likely help you select the perfect meal for your occasion.

Attracted in after a long days sightseeing by the happy hour offer on the posters. Checked with our waiter before we ordered... bill arrived - full price! Waiter blamed "confusion" and a "new menu". Reduced the bill a little - but felt conned and so not now returning for dinner as we had planned. Annoying as we are staying right next door

Had a wonderful night at this restraunt , on a short visit to Singapore only by luck we found it, by hearing LIVE MUSIC being played so we followed the music and we discovered this Bar/Restraunt, And they looked after us well staff and owner Natalie Wong (lovely lady) with good food and loadsa beer with portable 5pint beer pumps at table and a good dance, and the music was brillI totally recommend this bar and a bus stop right outside it to get there and back to Hote

'Few Good Man' is a burger - Nice combination of something that tasted like truffle and a tantalizing wagyu patty in all the burgers selection. More variety of burgers should be made available on the menu apart from beef per se. Fumee has quite a few themes all mixed into one. Approaching from the Millennia mall just opposite Harvy Norman, One would think this is a grocery shop selling bacon, hams and cheese. The rows of drinks stacked on racks felt as if one had walked into a supermarket. Only breezing through the narrow walkway would one be transitioned into a chic and funky restaurant setting with a great selection of wine, whisky and beer. There is also a tiny stage with performance on the weekends. Both indoor and alfresco dinning are available and a private dining area provides excellent party in small groups.The waiters and waitress weren't too attentive to top up our water and we find the glass is just too small. The cheese and chicken dish was a little too 'jelad' or cheesy. The price for burgers are a little too steep from $18++ but thankfully I had a 10% discount using an OUB credit card. Will return again to try the selection of whisky

We were in the area and wondered what's good here to eat...We read good reviews of food here and decided to come check things out for ourselves! We ordered:* Chilli Crab Pasta - it was actually rather spicy but over-bearing. The taste was not really like the Chilli crab you get in restaurants but it's still nice. The crab meat was also generous in amount, so much so that there was enough ingredients for every mouthful. • Red Dot Pasta - this pasta was with Japanese fusion flair. The seafood (scallop, prawns, squid and Japanese fish roe) was fresh and adequate for the pasta. I also liked the familiar sweetish savoury Japanese sauce that coated the pasta. • Attitude Dude - a double-patty burger with onions and coleslaw and all the other yummies. And truth be told, it was really great from the first bite! Hubby said price for quality, it beat many other burger joints. • Chicken Cheese Sausage Hotdog - an item from kid's menu but the serving was actually enough for a small adult eater. Taste was good too, the sourdough bun was crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside. Sausage was really cheesy and my daughter was so impressed with that! The hand cut fries was also very well fried and seasoned! I have eaten many many fries in my life and this really ranked quite high in terms of taste and texture!Didn't expect to have had such a satisfactory meal here. Will definitely recommend to friends and family

Great party venue for 19 of us. Ate up their kitchen (probably!) and enjoyed lots of drinks - Fumee's awesome Beer Bank kept us well hydrated. Fortunately it didn't hurt our pockets and we could afford the cab fare home.

Great place with cozy ambiance. Good food, glass of wine or beer with live band. Nothing much to ask for.
They do have huge space with perfect table settings for any events.
Great experience!

Was here for Mothers' Day celebration. Service was decent, quality of food was good. Selection of food and wine items is excellent. Fumee extended the Prosecco promotion on top of the Mothers' Day promo being run, which earns them points. The floor is spacious, but the tables are a little cramped. Generally, a viable place I'd hangout after-hours with friends

We decided to stop here for a quick bite and over all it was pretty good. The service was fine and we had a table outside watching the world go by so that was nice. The food was good though one of our selections needed to be warmer but they graciously comped it for us. For Singapore the price was moderate and it was very clean so I would return

At the wrong end of Millenia Walk looms Fumee. It is a great idea but suffers from identity crisis - is it a grocer, a whisky bar, a burger joint, a lounge or a restaurant?Owners are friendly, the young chef is remarkably talented but clearly Fumee has a long way to go in terms of overcoming its teething problems - inattentive staff, slow response, poorly-designed menu and high prices.Other than that, the concept is great, albeit not new, and the potential is there

We were staying next door at the Pan Pacific and had walked past a few times on Monday And Tuesday and had been asked by staff to come in and try the food.On Wednesday night we decided to go down and have a drink.The place was empty except two staff members standing out the front.The first thing I asked them was do you have Jim Beam and Coke and got a yes.So we went inside and I asked how much is a Jim Beam and Coke and was told $7 by the bartender so I gave the waitress $10 and said I would have 1.She walked to the rear of the restaurant to get the change and I noticed the bartender adding Pepsi to my drink.I tried to stop him straight away but he had already put just a splash in.I said It was meant to be Coke and was now told no only Pepsi.So I said don't worry Pepsi will do but he didn't fill the glass, just gave it to me and walked off.I did ask him if he could fill the glass and he said no.Then the waitress came back with the receipt and $1.75 change.I had to have a look at the receipt and yes $7++ is $8.25.This is so wrong not to include the tax as I have no choice but to pay it.This adding on of tax later has not happened with anything else I have purchased in 3 trips to Singapore.As my drink took only 2 sips to drink I left straight away.I was planning on staying for a few and waiting for my Fiancée to come back and have a few to with me.Their Loss

Terrific Bar/Restaurant, the food and drinks were great at affordable prices. If a drink wasn't on the menu they were happy to make it for you and if it wasn't to your liking there was an offer to try again. The live music was a bonus and not too loud. Natalie's service and memory after one visit was amazing, we just had to go back. Thanks Jayne & Leann

Was with some colleagues at Marina Square area and we were looking for a place for dinner. We came by to this restaurant located nearby at Millenia Walk.Instead of getting food individually, we decided to order and share amongst the group, allowing us to try different items on the menu.We sat at the al fresco area where we could enjoy the evening breeze and literally watch the world go by.Here are the highlights of our meal:- Charcuterie Board: Truffle salami, Chorizo Iberico, Parma ham. The truffle salami is really aromatic and tasty! - Cheese platter: Mimolette, Fourm d'ambert & Comte. Served with toasted bread, raisins, jam and apricots. Cheeses were really good. - Assortment of Italian heirloom tomatoes with Burrata cheese, that's soft and creamy. Yummy!- Beef short rib: A whole beef short rib. Good for 4. Sitting atop mashed potatoes, which goes well with the juices from the rib. Meat was tender and flavorful. - Beef Burger: This was cut into quarters and each quarter was held together by a toothpick. All you have to do is to pick a piece and eat. no cutting needed. The meat was done medium rare. Really juicy! - Risotto with salmon: The salmon was pink when I cut into it. Really good. The konbu topping on top of the salmon added a nice umami taste to the dish.We also ordered some wine to go with the food. There is a wide selection of wines that will cater to what you fancy for that meal. Other than wines, they also have beers, sake and whiskies. Drinkers wouldn’t be disappointed!Overall, the food quality is good and the ambience is nice and cosy. If you like what you eat, you can also visit the deli section where you can pick up meats and cheeses to go

Chanced upon this place late one night on a Saturday. Good mellow live music and a pleasant range of options for sitting inside and outside. Chilled out and happy atmosphere, good attentive and friendly service.Food was good. We had the grilled foie gras (delicious), seafood pasta (great), soup (fantastic) and risotto (not bad, good texture, a bit creamy/bland). My daughter had the kids pasta which was clearly well made with high quality fresh ingredients and a generous portion, good taste. Recommended for a relaxed lunch or casual dinner with friends or family

The set lunch is fantastic value for money. We tried the salmon risotto and cheese burger which were both good. The set lunch comes with a soup or salad and choice of soft drink/ coffee/ tea @ S$19.90++. Both of us loved the butternut squash soup. Service was attentive and friendly. Would come back again to try to the live band nights. It has a great space for casual meetups and after work drinks
