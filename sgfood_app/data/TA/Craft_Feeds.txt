My husband and I found this delightful restaurant while wandering around Chinatown in Singapore on a recent stopover. In the mood for something cold to drink we were drawn to the huge array of craft beers. Yes there was a great selection of international beers both bottled and on tap but what really surprised us was the innovative menu. Wow. The shared style menu included Hokkaido Scallops, Tuna Tartare, Iberico Pork Cheeks and Wagyu Rump. Our favourite vegies were the duck fat potatoes and the air dried kale chips. The staff matched our beers to our dishes which really enhanced our experience. Add very competitive prices, great service from their extremely friendly staff and a wonderful atmosphere and you will have a delightful evening. Highly recommend next time you're in Singapore. I know we'll be back.
