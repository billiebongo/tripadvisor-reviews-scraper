I'm not big on desserts, but if I was buying desserts for vegans, I wouldn't go there, as reliable vegan friends have told me unhappy stories. But, for lacto cakes, yes, please go.

I tried the vegan durian cake just because. It was moist and I was impressed with the light creamy icing and although I ate all of it, it tasted like onions. I probably wouldn’t get it again, but I’m glad I tried it.

After check-in hotel across the street, we came looking for lunch. The signboard Hot Cakes n Vegetarian did not attract our attention. But the friendly staff who stood at the door n invited us in to try out their food made the difference. We ordered vegetarian chicken rice and the like... Wow! It tasted so good, never knew it was so tasty. No regrets coming here for food.

We came here twice during our two days in Singapore. The owners are delightful, and the food is fantastic. We had two of the main dishes (mock fish and a tofu dish) which were delicious, and for dessert we had two different types of cake, each very good, even for non-vegans. Definitely a must in Singapore! We will be back

I've visited Hotcakes a couple of times for lunch and cake, and can say that they prepare wonderful food. The laksa is delicious, and the nasi lemak is super good too. I've had a few different flavours of their cake, and they're very creamy and moreish (though one that I had was a bit more of a dense texture like a muffin - but the other were light and fluffy). Just make sure to check about what is vegan, as not everything on the menu or in the cake cabinet is.

Tucked away in an old mall in Bugis area. Tried the basil tomato spaghetti and the margherita pizza. Both superb. Priced at about $9 per dish, they are from a small menu of simple dishes that are excellently done. I wouldn't have looked at this place if I hadn't seen it on TripAdvisor (it's a small, unspectacular looking shop), but it was worth the find. You owe it to yourself to come here, thumbs up

Local food and some classical italian dishes too like pasta and Pizza. Had the spaghetti ai funghi (mushroom) and the Nasi Lemak Ikanbaka both were really tasty! It would be hard pushed to recommend a pasta dish since I have been Italy many times and I am a bit of a foodie but fear not the pasta here was good in my humble opinion. Nasi Lemak with a vegetarian fish alternative makes you not even miss having fish. They also have pizza which you can have with vegetarian cheese at a few dollars more. But prices are low so all great value. Would highly recommend if you want a simple bite! Oh and they specialise in cakes, with lots of vegan options! Topto

inside fortune centre, 1st level. cosy shop, not much seats available, nice owner n friendly people. Has a Facebook page and posts cakes available.will not regret trying the "meatball" pasta made of mushrooms --->> order made by a young lady will taste better. small portion pasta but its nice!lunch time specials will be value for money. Vegan cakes are soft, creamy and heavenly. black forest and tiramisu tastes wonderful (buy the whole cake for better value because 1 slice costs $6) and try their soy latte!====havent had the chance to try their vegan pizza===****pls state your vegan before ordering as some items contain milk***
