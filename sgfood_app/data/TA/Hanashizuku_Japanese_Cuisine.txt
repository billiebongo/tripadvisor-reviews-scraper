Seshi was great delicous. The location wasn't a pleasant place but it's right next to Cuppage terrace area.

Food is good, but the service unfortunately left much to be desired. You seldom will get your tea refilled unless you'd asked for at least 3 - 4 times. Same goes for trying to get their attention to take your orders.

Food is good and very relaxing environment, maybe just that the food portion can slightly increase a bit

Food was deliciousl. Staff was very accomodating. Even bought bottled water for us since they donâ€™t sell one. A bit pricey thou but worth it

They do not have Christmas menu, however they do have seasonal menu.
Majority of the Japanese restaurant they do have some special menu for their regular, so Im glad they always have something special for me. ^^

Went to celebrate my friend's birthday, they do not sell cakes in return, provide complimentary sweet potato dessert with a candle.

Friendly and attentive staffs could be one of the main reason for us to keep returning, of course their seasonal menu is always fresh and great :)

1st time visit to Hanashizuku Japanese Cuisine. Very nice environment, and pretty cutlery that the friendly lady boss spent a lot of effort sourcing and matching it. Food taste very well, and good recommendation from the lady boss. Free deserts serve to us that surprises us. Will surely visit them soo

I love its comfortable and cheerful ambient. The whole setting felt more like an izakaya than a restaurant. A place that I will come to relax, have a few drinks and enjoy an exquisite meal. It serves quite an extensive range of small dishes and some were quite unusual. Food standard was really good. Its Japanese chef is from Okinawa. Full range of alcoholic options. Service was prompt and friendly. Highly recommended

You know the food here is authentic when you see Japanese eating here too. But the portion is quite small. They gave us a private room for 8 of us which was really nice.

We like the Okinawan food here, it tastes just like what we encountered during our trip there. The staff are friendly but the service can be a bit patchy.

Great good. Good ambiance and wonderful service. Recommended! The location is bit hidden and did not know where this place was. Glad we found it.

The quality of food was good and waiting time was minimal. Ambience was decent. However, the level of service can be improved. There's also a $5 compulsory appetiser included, which may be a turn off for customers. Depending on what you order, cost is $50-$60 per person on average. Reservations should be made in advance

We had a get together with some very good old friends here yesterday and leaving the ordering to one of them promised some outstanding food choices.The dishes that rocked up at our table were without exception dashing delicious from the sashimi to the yakitory all the way to the creamy dream that was their mentaiko pasta. To my favorites yesterday counted the scallop carpaccio with ponzu jelly and truffle and the iberico pork steak preserved in rice malt. I even liked the raw squid marinated in it's own liver which I normally I don't fancy too much. On top of the menu and the nice ambient atmosphere the staff and owner made our evening even better with their great attentive and friendly service. All in all a fantastic night at a fantastic place with great food and fun. Domo arigato gozaimasu

One of the worst experience in a Japanese restaurant! Never have I felt such racism in a Japanese eatery, in my own country, by a foreign waitress! My partner was in the midst of ordering from this waitress who decided to abruptly turn around and walk a Japanese customer out the door. Less than a minute later, she did the same exact thing to welcome a Japanese customer into the restaurant! Imagine talking halfway, turned and realised the waitress left.. well, we definitely experienced that today. I don't see her walking a Singaporean couple out the door when they leave; nor did she bow and smile as brightly as she did to Japanese customers. Too obvious and such a racist person!Next she asked if it was our first time to the restaurant and told us they serve an appetizer, which we thought was a nice gesture to welcome new customers. However, she continued by saying that it's a charge of $5 each. We chose to decline that offer. Guess what! She said is COMPULSORY! Seriously! So obviously it's not up to us to decide, we let it pass and be served to us. It was just a tiny piece of tofu - for $5! The other tables didn't have that "compulsory" appetizer, so I was convinced it was not compulsory and refused to touch the pathetic tofu. Hence while billing we told the waitress to take that out of the bill. She had the audacity to say "you should have told me in the first place". Firstly, that is pure RUDENESS in the service industry. Secondly, she obviously does not know the meaning of the word "compulsory".The sashimi was fresh but badly cut and placed on the sushi. The other dishes were below average. An extremely bad experience!! Not only Japanese customers deserve good service. There is absolutely no basic courtesy for humans, PERIOD

We came across this restaurant by chance as our usual spot was full. It is a little on the pricy end but service and quality of the food was excellent. If you want a taste of good quality japanese food in Singapore, this would be one of the places to go
