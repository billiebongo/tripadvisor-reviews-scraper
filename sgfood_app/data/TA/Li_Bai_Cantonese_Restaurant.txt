My family enjoyed our birthday celebration and the service provided by Ms Michelle Ee made our experience very memorable and unforgettable. Without her, it will never be the same.

The food there always live up to their expection. The staffs especially Christine, Jester and Stephanie are very attentive, patient and friendly. Overall, it is a great experience and i will definitely go back there again.
5
This is one of my favourite Chinese restaurant that always serve food to my expectation. Their dim sum and cooked dishes have been superb in taste.
Best of all, their service staff, especially Christine, Jester and Stephanie will make sure you dine in comfort.
5
Great food, out of way services and great value for $.
Service staff are long serving like Sam, Hazel, Michelle, Christine, Stephanie and Amy, all invaluable and fixed assets of the restaurant.
Never fall to impress me and my guests over the last 10 years.

Mom and I had the scallop with lily bulb with asparagus, claypot eggplant stuffed with seafood, cod and drunken chicken. For dessert, we had almond tea and glutinous rice balls with sesame fillings. Excellent food - compliments to the Chef and team. Compliments to Michelle,Amy, Stephanie, Christine and Madalyn - ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ service. Thanks much for the wonderful dining experienceYe

As above. Please change for chopsticks for hygiene reasons Started coming here regularly for dinner. Frequent prompt refill of tea. Generally good service. Minor point is it's also important to thank customers when they are going off to complete the experience. Manager decides who she wants to welcome warmly but we always happen not to be in her greet list. Also basic etiquette they should wait for customers to finish food before rushing them if they want desser

Have enjoyed meals here, and every experience satisfies. In fact, this is one of two places in Singapore that I have top-of-mind when craving for dimsum (the other is Royal China at the Raffles Hotel). Service is professional and prompt. Interiors are elegant. The big plus is carpark coupons

Li Bai has been around for many years and the food and service quality have always remained on the highest level. It is my absolute favourite Dim Sum place in Singapore. Make sure you try their shrimp dumplings, Siew Mai, 小籠包 (pork dumplings) as well as scallop dumplings. Besides Dim Sum, their black pepper and roast chicken are very tasty. There is a wide selection of soups which I recommend you to try, as there's definitely something according to your taste. If you get a chance, try the crocodile too. It was on the monthly menu when I was there and they prepare it very well. I've been here many, many times, but I really don't remember trying anything that I didn't like. Food is super-fresh and delicious. Service is on point. The staff are very friendly and attentive. As soon as you have a sip of tea, they will appear and refill your cup.The restaurant is nicely designed and feels very cozy. It is good for couples as well as larger groups. You can also book private rooms. It is conveniently located in the Sheraton Towers Hotel, close to the city centre. If you're going to Singapore, make sure you don't miss this one

I wish to compliment the staff at Li Bai Cantonese Restaurant.All the staff are very well trained in the waiting service.Food is excellent, kudos to Chef Chung & his team.A group of excellent service staff , Especially Ms Hazel, Sam, Amy, Christine,Stephane and Jester.Chef Chung always recommends new dishes to us. Like crisply Mee Hoon with fresh prawn, Golden Dragon Chicken & many others. also like to add, the ambient is always soothing and pleasant.

My family of 6 were there for a birthday celebration dinner on a Saturday. I chose Li Bai due to the good review and indeed, no disappointment. Food was great with a wide selection. We had 9 dishes in total including individual soup, Peking duck and the special fish noodles. Most of the dishes we had are in small or half portion, slightly over order but we managed to clear them all. Do try their longevity buns if you are having a birthday celebration. Service was impeccable. We love how attentive the staff are to our needs. Kudos to Stephanie and the team for the great service! The prices are unexpectedly reasonable too.
5
Li Bai remains my favorite Chinese restaurant in Singapore. The food is always top class and the service staff always ready with wonderful food recommendations. The ambience is pleasant and suitable for both business and family meals.
5
Best services and Cantonese cuisine in Orchard road area. Recommended for all visitors. Family, business, private gathering.
5
The food is v good and service is excellent! The staff promptly replaced our dirty places and filled our tea.
5
I enjoy a private room business lunch. Super service, very tasteful food .... when is not only luxury but also very good food....you close one eye on the price!
5
I was at Li Bai last weekend for dinner with my family. We were blown away by the food, service and overall experience at the restaurant. Great quality dishes at reasonable prices! Can't wait to come back and try more dishes!
5
Delicious abalone soup, delicate dim sum, fried asparagus with garlic and roast meats. Tea was excellent and so was the service.
5
Excellent food in which the chef had prepared. The ambience and service provided by the staff was impeccable.
5
We have been eating at this restaurant for at least 20 years. Staff turnover is low and we know the service staff from way back. The food is consistently good and they have kept some dishes from way back and every now and again, they add something new to their menu. The recent 'fish noodles' we had there was just superb. It came at the end of all the courses and we still ate it all
5
I was in Hong Kong for 5 years and loves Cantonese cuisine.Although Singapore is Chinese nation, it is very difficult to find out the place where can provide real taste of Hong Kong, except Li Bai.I believe that this place is the best Cantonese restaurant in Singapore.Also service staff at the restaurant are very friendlyand served us with great hospitality.Thanks to Cindy, Stephanine !We could enjoy our special dinner with your kind and friendly assistance
5
I have been to this restaurant since 2005 and the service has always been excellent and consistent. The staff have mostly remained the same and remember your preferences.The main menu has not changed much but is extensive. You can always ask for recommendations and the managers offer great advice e.g. "What can you do with seabass? "For baby bokchoy, what do you think is the best way to do it?"Its weekday dim sum is more creative than weekends but weekends are very popular with family so booking is essential.They offer free parking
5
Always a great place to get selected dim sum. Recommend the porridge, carrot cake and prawn dishes.
Reservations strongly recommended. Slightly pricier than normal dim sum places but very reasonable for quality, especially in group of 4.
5
Classy and authentic Cantonese. Wonderful service in a beautiful room. Good value Well worth a visit
5
Compliments to Michelle, Amy and all the service staff - 6 stars service. Compliments to the Chef and team - 6 stars food.
4
Love the shark bone's soup which is rich in flavour but rather expensive for a high end Chinese cuisine
4
This place serves fine Chinese food. Ok ambience and service. Come if you are around this part of Orchard and try their fine cuisine ..
4
This is a very nice cantonese restaurant if you like cantonese food of course. Variety of small, medium and large size dishes. For one person a small size dish is enough especially if you combine with a starter or dessert. Also very suitable for larger groups of people
4
We were staying during Chinese New Year and the restaurant was packed with Chinese families having rejoicing but luckily Kolin the great Bar Manager at the Sheraton got us a table.We were 2 idiots looking for a Cantonese dinner and arrived at the basement restaurant whereupon they gave us a round table for 10! Brilliant.The food was absolutely wonderful as was the service.The only downside is the room whilst huge and airy is in a basement and lacked any feeling. Anyway thoroughly recommended for the food
5
Haven't had the Cantonese Peking Duck at Li Bai for nearly 6 months. Ordered one for dinner with family and friends and it was as I remember. The most important part of this dish is the skin and Li Bai did an excellent job.The chef carved out thin and crispy pieces of Peking Duck skin to accompany sprigs of spring onion and dollops of thick sweet sauce on steamed wraps. Also the fatty layer beneath the duck skin was reduced. The chopped pieces of meat served as a separate dish were juicy and tender to bite. Li Bai remains on my list of top Cantonese restaurants to enjoy roasted Peking Duck in Singapore
2
Li Bai was a famous Chinese poet and supposedly very hospitable with his guests. Unfortunately this was not what I expected when 10 of us had our CNY dinner there on the night of 3 Feb. The food was so so for the price and the lady captain's attention seemed to focus only on their 'regular' customers. I asked the waiter to help to get my hp battery charged as it was flat. 2 hours later he handed me back the phone with 15% charged. Reason? Another customer before me insisted that his phone has to be fully charged! If you want to get a feel of how Hong Kong people treated their customers 30 years ago this is it! But Hong Kong has moved on.

Just had a reunion dinner at Li Bai for a group of 8. I had heard that the food there is really good and after trying, I must agree. However, is the food really that fantastic to justify the high price tag? NO. Bearing in mind we didn't order any CNY set which I feel is a rip-off for the kind of dishes, we did ala-carte instead with add-on suckling pig and lobster lohei. I was shocked the suckling pig and lobster lohei alone cost $300 and $268 respectively. Sliced Abalone with mushroom and sea cucumber was $135 and the abalone was soooo thinly sliced! A plate of plain broccoli in oyster sauce cost $30 which was the cheapest dish. The total cost for the dinner came up to $1500 - the most expensive reunion dinner I've ever had. Although food was good, it was not unforgettable.
4
Li Bai is located in the basement of the Sheraton hotel. Its upscale canotnese food and prices reflect that. All the dishes we had were good but I would not call it spectacular. Service is good but it was pretty empty when we ate.
3
no specific food and service but cost/price is 1st class
there is alots of better chinese restaurant near horel, suggest to go another
4
Authentic cantonese cuisine at reasonable price. Has seasonl menus too for festive occasions.
Can bring your own wine or order from good selection.
4
Always a great place to dine. Fresh ingredients, great Chinese cooking, delicious & flavorful, reasonable service. Ordered 1 set each of the Promotion Delight & NEw Year Day Special. Both @ SGD 158 per person.Fantastic Peiking duck. Very tasty Mini Buddha Jumps, just felt that the bird's nest will be heavenly in a sweet dessert rather than in a savoury soup. Deluxe Combination was generous with a whole abalone but rest of set was forgettable.Egg white & milk in young coconut an acceptable dessert but the double boiled almond cream with Hasma in Young Coconut was fabulous.Will be perfect if the plating & presentation can be better. Plate should at least be wiped clean after placing food on it - messy streaks of sauce was on edge of plate.Oh, both the glasses of white & red wines were poor.Will appreciate much more if a little big more effort in plating & presentation
5
One of best Cantonese restaurants in Singapore. great service and food selection extensive. wine list also expansive. Skin of Peking Duck had little fat and plum source was a new variation that was perfect. Stuffed scallops using crab meat was something different and such a combinatio
5
Li Bai is my favorite restaurant in Singapore. I have been there about three times and every time at Li Bai has been phenomenal. The service was world class. The food was presented well and it tasted awesome. This is a must when you are in Singapore.
3
We were staying at the Sheraton, and took the opportunity to try out the cuisine. How disappointed we were. Service was below standard. I specially asked for the HK chef to prepare a standard popular Chinese, scrambled eggs HK style. To taste the skill of a real chef, you can tell by asking the chef to fry a simple egg. I was disappointed!!
5
Another excellent meal.The steamed fish fillet with ginger was flavoursome. This is not on the menu.The stuffed scallops with wolfenberries and lily bulbs were light and appetising.The XO sauce fried rice was delicious; the chef replaced diced duck with chicken for me.Finished off with black glutinous rice with coconut icecream and mango purée.You can earn SPG points too
4
At a large dinner we attended, Executive Chef Chung Yiu Ming whipped up what was perhaps the best banquet we have experienced in Singapore. Premium dishes beautifully executed - lobster salad; double-boiled clear soup with abalone, baby sea cucumber, fish maw and conpoy; braised egg wrapped with scallops in crab meat sauce; baked cod with black truffle; chicken wing stuffed with glutinous rice and topped with foie gras; bird’s nest dessert in young coconut. Service was impeccable. If meal quality is most important criterion in choosing a banquet venue, this is a top contender. Li Bai cooking can be as lyrical as Li Bai's poetry
4
It has been more than a year did not step into this restaurant, so I've decided to give a treat to my family. I didn't know they are not selling shark fin anymore. Their stir friend shark fin with bean sprouts is delicious (imagine eating char kuey teow, but the kuey teow replace with shark fins). We ordered 8 dishes, they are few dishes to recommend, try their shark bone soup (it is milky colour, very very delicious and oommpp), next must try their tea duck (skin is crisp and meat is juicy. It is different from peking duck). The stuffed prawn with mushroom is good too (the prawn is juicy and fresh, one piece per person is good enough coz the size is big). Their fried rice / noodles are good (enough of wok hei). Lastly, if you still have room for dessert, can go for their warm almond cream or black glutinous rice with ice-cream.
4
The restaurant is freezing cold, that makes it a bit uncomfortable. Food is good, we ordered a peking duck and that was very nice.
Restaurant not very busy
5
The humble dimsum is relaunched in many creative presentations; my favourite is scallop wrapped in crunchy rice noodle. Pretty interiors. Outstanding service. The table lay-out is spacious and allows for private or business conversations. Highly-recommended.
5
Food👍🏻 Service👍🏻 Environment👍🏻 Price👍🏻 Convenience👍🏻
Not the first time here, definitely will come back again and recommend to friends.
5
Reasonably priced for a delightful lunch - staff were very courteous and attentive. We tried 2 sets - everyone preferred the one with the cod @ SGD48 per set. The other had lobster @ SGD58 per set.
4
This restaurant is in the lower floor of the Sheraton Towers. It has great cantonese for and thefts part is that you get great vegetarian food.
The service is immaculate and the suggestions for ordering are very helpful.
5
During a brief visit to Singapore and having lived there some many years earlier the Li Bai restaurant was selected as the venue for a dinner reunion with some dear Singaporean friends.
It was a lovely evening and the food and service was impeccable.
5
I have been eating here for over ten years.Service is impeccable. The staff remember your preference. Majority of the staff have been here for longer than I can recall. They have very creative dim sum on week days while weekend dim sum offering is more traditional.Dinner is often intimate and leisurely as it is less crowded. Their business lunch is popular so book ahead, so is lunch on weekends. Complimentary car park coupon. Don't forget your Starwood number to earn SPG points
5
Always go to Li Bai for lunch before I checkout the hotel.Li Bai is a well known Chinese restaurant in Singapore that serve by silver, ivory and jade cutlery.The food they serve is really up to standard and really tasty and also big portion too! The dim sum also very nice to
4
Li Bai continues to prepare the most succulent dimsum plates (The xiao long bao is the juiciest in Singapore, in my opinion. In addition, the cod roll is a creative unforgettably subtly savoury dish). The short orders (fried diced beancurd in salt & pepper, for example) are served within a short time. The hotel aircon is rather cold but staff is quick is offering a shawl (for ladies) or a coat (for men). Tea is inexpensive but freshly made. Not an inexpensive restaurant, but food quality is really high. My family keeps going back to this restaurant, as I imagine many people do. Reservations are strongly recommended as the place is (almost) always packed. Tips: 1) When asking for the bill, ask which credit card companies offer the 10% discount. On this month of March 2016, this promo is extended by UOB Visa and Standard Chartered Bank cards. 2) Hotel parking is free when you ask for a parking coupon from the restaurant staff. What a plus
4
Having lived in Beijing for 7 years I was confident of our ordering, found the menu a little difficult, but the server was excellent and guided us through as they have small, medium and large servings. Can't say enough of the food, it was excellent. The wine list was small, but found something for the occasion. Just a couple of things, the staff, although great, were racing around, running in some instances and it made you feel that you should hurry up and let someone else take your seat, the other thing was that on reviewing the bill later on we noticed that the complimentary (well we thought it was) Yam Chip (which tasted slightly stale) was charged at S$5. Not a lot I know, but we didn't order it and was placed on the table as a gesture of welcome. Overall a great meal was had
4
Went for lunch with some friends and I just loved the food here. This is a high-ended restaurant at night but on lunch time you can enjoy quality dim-sum at reasonable price. Definitely will visit again.
5
Great food, I thought I would treat myself after a successful weeks business and I was glad I did. Worth a look. Excellent.
2
Entree (scallops) and main course (duck) were confused and reversed. Scallops were like cardboard and tasteless. Average wine $20 per glass. A Top 10 Restaurant? I don't think so.
4
Went there as part of my team get together. This is situated below the lobby and easily accessible. To be very frank as a India, haven't had much options, but when I asked for Chinese chicken fried rice, they obliqued and helped, which is nice of the
5
I come here often with family & friends. It's a fantastic place to have dim sum for lunch or Chinese food for dinner. Every dish is finely made. If you're a fan of soup, always go for Cantonese restaurant and Li Bai is one of them.
5
Most of the Dim Sum restaurant in Singapore is quite noisy and usually packed with customers without reservation. Li Bai does take reservation and it is very well organized and the atmosphere is also very comfortable. The best dishes are dumplings and soup. There are many tourists as well as locals. Since Sheraton is 10 minutes walk from Orchard, it is less visited by walk-ins. Strongly recommend to people
4
Stalwart of the hotel Chinese restaurant scene. In the 80s, well known for service par excellence, worthy of the Queen. 30 years later, service is less regal yet still better than most. (Occasionally suffers from very noisy children and badly dressed local patrons. Manager and captains try to shush them, but these days, it's nigh impossible a task, with over-indulgent young parents.)Overall: Good solid Cantonese cuisine with local (mostly Malaysian) wait-staff.Tip: Go for weekday business lunches, avoid business dinners on weekends
4
Went there with my friend together to try out the food which another friend of mine recommended. Nice place to eat. Price is affordable compare to other hotel in Singapore. Although I been there last year, but I still miss the food very much. Stephanie was really attentive. She kept helping me to refill my tea. I like her hospitality. The only thing is the service staff namely AMY is bad. She accidentally kicked my chair but she never apologies and yet she still stared at me. What kind of service is this
5
I had the great fortune of dining here twice on my trip to Singapore -- once for dim sum on a Sunday, and another for a very formal wedding reception-like dinner on a Wednesday. Both days the food was absolutely amazing. So delicious, so creative, so fulfilling. You can say they're just serving standard Cantonese dim sum fare, but the quality is just so top notch. The dinner (non-dim sum) dishes were also really unique -- for example, I had a roasted hog with skin that was so crispy and meat that was so tender and flavorful. I also had some really amazing fish dishes. Just ask for their specialty dishes and you won't be disappointed. What I noticed is that even though it's family style, they serve you dish by dish, so when you're finished with one, they'll take it away, give everyone a new plate, and bring out the second dish. This is very different from the traditional Asian style "family style" where all the dishes are brought out to the table and everyone just digs in. At Li Bai, by bringing the dishes out one at a time, it sort of helps pace our eating. Definitely try this place out if you're in Singapore.
5
I've lived in Singapore and Hong Kong for many years and have dined at some of the best Cantonese restaurants. In Singapore I put Li Bai at the top of my list for Cantonese fine dining. Li Bai has a renowned chef who is popular with local customers who frequent the restaurant. During hairy crab season the chef offers numerous special dishes that are superb. I haven't had better barbecue meats in Singapore. Peking duck is a popular dish here and can be ordered half-portioned. Check the daily specials as they are made with with the freshest seasonal ingredients. Service is attentive. Li Bai has a seasoned staff who know their custmers. Li Bai is expensive but a great value as you'll enjoy the finest Cantonese food in Singapore
5
Expensive but worth it. This restaurant never fails to please. Intimate and without reservations you may have a problem getting a table. When see the number of local eating here you know it is good.
4
Glad to have discovered this place. Always good to have variety of good places for dim sum. Li Bai certainly doesn't dissapoint but don't expect it to serve outstanding food but sure does give you consistent quality. Just another of those 5-star dim sum eateries.
5
I dined there and enjoyed a most delicious dinner. The staff were very understanding as I dined not long before they were closing. They made me feel very welcome and did not rush me at all. Most enjoyable
5
Tell them how you want the food prepared, and the chef will endeavour to get it done. Peking duck is my recommendation.
4
Here to have a bit of Dim Sum and a bit or a la carte dishes. Overall is good. Service is a bit poor perhaps a short of staff as there is a wedding going on. Try the frog legs with fried ginger.
3
I've been told that Li Bai is one of the top Chinese restaurant in S'pore, when I tried it with my friends, I sincerely think the following:1. Good Peking duck, crispy skin.2. Overly sautéed fried rice, burnt taste in almost every spoon.3. Mediocre mango sago dessert.4. Ribs soup good5. Shark bone soup - not my kind of soup, but tasted rich enough for the price (~$28)6. Sautéed snow pea vegetable - good. Can a Chinese chef go wrong with this simple dish?7. Home made nuts - mediocre, they tasted like they have gone bad.For the price that they are charging, I have tasted BETTER duck fried rice at the hawker stalls, I agree with another reviewer (BADAMS1987).The silver platter used to serve warm towels were dirty and sticky, brought new ones and it was also sticky.The service was good.Why were there different napkin design folded in one table? Is consistency not the key
1
Went for a meal tonight as had seen decent reviews but wow what a let down! Firstly the waiters rushed the meal and we had to tell them numerous times to back off and slow down as it was ridiculous! Also we ordered the half Peking duck and they made duck pancakes but only put in the skin and said the rest would be in the fried rice! The fried rice came out and there was sod all duck in the rice so was clearly ripped off! Overall I wouldn't recommend this place at all! Go the hawkers instead!
2
Went here for family dim sum and it was average at best. The food was bland and the taste was not comparable to other hotel dim sum (or any other restaurants really). Don't get we wrong, the food here is not awful and inedible but it is not outstanding and for the price there at e plenty of other places that I would go to. Just for the record we had Peking duck, fried rice, tofu, lots of different dim sum dishes so we ordered enough to form a reasonable opinion
4
This has been my go to Chinese restaurant for a number of years. Quality is always good and on my most recent visit we had to deal with food allergies for one of the party All done with a minimum of fuss and dishes adapted as required. Very impressive service and the Peking Duck and fish courses were excellent
5
I managed to eat here twice in one day last weekend due to some scheduling issues on my behalf. But I was more than happy to return for dinner after a delicious lunch. We were lucky enough to dine in a private room and some lovely locals ordered for us and everything was delicious. The service was attentive but completely unobtrusive. The whitebait and pork belly are definately worth trying.
4
Dim sum and menu options were very good - pricey, but the quality of food made up for this. If you want to stay in hotel and eat this is a good option
3
You can expect the same kind of standard as per any other reputable Chinese restaurant. Nothing special except the price. A bit on the high side which do not give value for money.
5
Freshest ingredients. Attentive service. Some dimsum creations are creative! Reasonably priced. Have eaten in the restaurant more than 10 times!
4
The dim sum from Li Bai is quite good and I like having that for lunch on a weekend. My favourites are the pork buns (not as crispy as Tim Ho Wan's; Li Bai's version is more like a pan-fried bun, but with superior char siew filling), the shrimp dumplings ("har gau"), the egg tarts (mini egg tarts, to be precise; you can gobble several rounds by yourself) and the pork and crabmeat "xiao long bao" (large and juicy, and prone to burning your tongue if you're not careful!). I've also tried the scallop with vegetables dumpling (good, but not particuarly outstanding given that I love scallops!), the deep fried prawn with mango (interesting, since it comes encased in a spring roll, but the mango doesn't stand out sufficiently for a contrast), the chee cheong fun with shrimp filling, the fried carrot cake with XO chilli sauce (XO means special), the roasted pork -- all of which are pretty good, though not outstanding.I would also recommend the fish paste noodles with prawns. It's very good, especially if you like savoury dishes, as it comes with a sort of prawny base that's delicious. I am not sure if it's on the menu, but it's certainly available as a dish
2
Parking, ambience is great. Food wise, considering its Li Bai, is below average. For example, I ordered spiky sea cucumber but came out not the authentic spiky sea cucumber. Its normal sea cucumber with artificially made 'spikes'. Felt cheated.The other dishes are average in normal restaurant standard. But Its Li Bai, of course I expect the standard to be better than average (considering the pricing).Perhaps its time for the F&B management to do some QC checking

For more reviews, visit my blog at ms-skinnyfatLi Bai is well known for its wide range of Cantonese cuisine. I meant the restaurant located at the basement level of Sheraton Towers Singapore, not the famous Chinese poet. The cosy restaurant is popularly known for their dim sum but the other Cantonese dishes were stellar as well, which i found out after sampling some dishes from their Chinese New Year menu. Little appetizers were served and we couldn't stop snacking on the candied chestnuts with sesame seeds. The seasoned dried scallops with chili and dried shrimps had me ask for seconds (sans chili oil). I think there's some XO sauce added to it and it's certainly a good seasoning/accompaniment to the mains.Instead of the regular salmon yusheng, we had the Turbot fish, whose name in Chinese means 'many treasures'. There are fried taro and pumpkin slices in the mix, which gave the dish some added crunch.Next, the Braised Superior Bird's Nest with Crabmeat and Crab Roe. I was delighted to see that Li Bai uses birds' nest as a replacement for shark's fin. Well at least bird's nest can be sustainably farmed so it's the lesser of two evils. I liked the clean and light taste of the birds nest (Li Bai was extremely generous with the bird's nest), which was served with a copious amount of crab roe. Ask for the XO sauce, we heard from the PR girls that it's great with the soup. Next, the Lobster done two ways: Salted Egg Lobster and Sautéed fillet of lobster with greens. Surprisingly, I preferred the sautéed fillet even though anything served with salted egg is faultless. The sweetness of the crustacean could be tasted better with the ginger garlic sauce. The texture was superb as well, with the meat being springy instead of chewy. Stewed "Eight Treasures" Chicken with South African 5-head Abalone and Sea Cucumber is the perfect dish to be eaten with a bucket of fragrant steamed rice. Much effort has gone into the preparation of the chicken, which was first stuffed with chestnut, mushrooms, barley, lotus seed etc, then fried and browned, before stewing it for 2 hours to achieve that fall-off-the-bone quality. Abalone was briny sweet and tender too. We ended dinner with traditional Chinese desserts with a twist. This Pan-fried Nian Gao had coconut in it and was more like the Malay kueh. The Water Chestnut Cake hearts were a refreshing end to the dinner as well. Li Bai will be serving 9 reunion set menus that caters to various group sizes from 17 Jan to 24 Feb 2014. Do make a reservation in advance to prevent disappointment!Li Bai is certainly a Chinese restaurant that I will keep coming back to. Great service, environment and food. Mums will definitely love this one
4
Would have rated as excellent this establishment were it not for the service.Having to ask for the 'real' menu rather than the set meals is insulting- I may not be Chinese, but I am not stupid. Selling customers menus without showing a la carte really irritates me.Several staff members give off a vibe that they dont really take customers too seriously or want to make the meal pleasant. I spend enough time in restaurants to know what I am talking about on this point.As for the food- well that's the easy part- if you want to discover great Cantonese in Singapore in a refined setting- go to Li Bai.Just be vigilent with the staff waiting on you and dont put up with too much attitude.Would return- what the food is just excellent
5
Had dim sum for lunch. Very good service. But very little selection for dim sum. Only 12 dim sum available. Food we ordered fried rice ($20). Average though. Dim sum:- beancurd mushroom veg roll. - excellent!- pan fried pancake - average - sesame veg pancake - nice but too salty!- fried cod roll: nice! Can't rem the rest but, it's recommended and I will come Back.
5
I had a dinner at this restaurant with my colleagues and business partners and the food in this restaurant is definitely good. We did not order the set menus but instead we ordered from the ala carte, of which they are definitely delicious. A bit on the pricier side but worth a try
5
My wife and I love this little Restaurant . We have eaten here several times and everything is perfect. Service is outstanding as is the menu. The dishes are big enough to share. Our favourite is their Peking Duck and we usually order a half duck plus one other dish and their fried rice with crab ! More than enough for two and delicious. It is also very reasonably priced especially considering the quality a and service . Will always visit when in Singapore
5
I don't remember the dishes' names but do try the beef and fish dishes. Service is attentive and efficient.
5
excellent quality dim sum. everything on the menu is great, even the desserts.
2
excellent staff, but the peking duck was very dry, almonst along the line of cooked yesterday dry. I'm just guessing... but probably right.
4
Good food in an equally upmarket surrounding.
4
Dim Sum was unique and they will tailored to your needs. Quite cosy during weekdays. A little pricey..
5
I was there with a client for lunch and the food was awesome.The dim sum selection was good and the roasted meat combo was mouthwatering.The service level was excellent even the restaurant was busy with dining crowds. Kudos to the waiting staffs there.The ambience was perfect for business discussion for it's location in the basement level of Sheraton Towers Singapore.If you need a good place for business lunch, this is the right place to be. Highly recommended
4
Come here quite freqently for business, social and family. Quality of food have well maintained over the years and they continue to have some new dishes every year. Thoroughly enjoyed the recent wine tasting dinner. If you stay in the hotel, don't miss it. The peking duck will never disappoint and make sure you try the festive specials when available
3
Went for the seasonal hairy crab. Ordered the hairy crab dumplings , hairy crab roll and hairy crab horfun and some Tim sum. Was disappointed with the dumpling as it tasted like any Xiao long bao. The same goes for the mushroom roll. Only the horfun did not disappoint. The standard and quality has dropped tremendously for this restaurant. Perhaps they have changed chef. Paid $280 for 3 pax for a simple 6 dishes lunch.
5
Li Bai serves delicate cantonese dim sum in fine dining style and at affordable prices. You will know it when you eat food made with effort and heart. Highly recommend their flossed fried scallops and porridge. Staff are also attentive and overall services excellent.Only drawback is the lack of scenary / views as they are located at the basement of the Sheraton towers, though their interior deco more than make up for the absence. Do make reservations in advance and ask for a table in the main dining hall

Been to Li Bai 4-5 times for business and the last time struck me as a little odd as the food suddenly became fusion rather than straight up chinese which I preferred at Li Bai. Did they change the chef? We had pretty "odd" stuff like lamb steak with thai chilli etc. So the food just ended up tasting ok, but weird. The winelist was good

Simply great. Would only be 3 stars because of the pricing wise. It is not really very cheap.

Classy fine cantonese dining well worth the money if you have spare cash to burn ($80-100 / pax)

A safe and solid cantonese fare for non expert in cantonese delicacies. The private rooms and the super attentive service make you savour the excellent food with dedication.
