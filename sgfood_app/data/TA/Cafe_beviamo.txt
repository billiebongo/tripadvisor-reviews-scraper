We've found it hard to find great coffee in Singapore, but these guys nailed it - including the difficult-to-get-right piccolo. Add in soothing surrounds and a welcome break from the heat outside, and this café deserves top marks.

Upstairs inside Tanglin Mall, we visited twice for breakfast. limited menu but it is all good and freshly prepared. Their coffee is a Singapore institution and it does not disappoint. Efficient, friendly service.
4
The café is sited in a very quiet, small mall and frequented by many ex-pat Brits and families. The food is very good and the service is excellent with very polite staff.
5
Hummingbird cake, carrot cake, cappuccino it is all outstanding ! The quality and service in this cafe never let us down !

Service was fast and all attentive.Fresh Pineapple juice was good (wished it we're cold though). I ordered the spinach Ravioli which was tasty...however it did come out quickly it wasn't as hot (temperature) as I would've liked. Good portion size. Was initially going to have dessert too but I was too full from portion size of pasta to try something.Very busy today for lunch
4
Have been coming here for years, partly because of the incredibly efficient staff, and because of the menu. Was a bit disappointed with the menu this time, as it had changed. However, the staff are very willing to vary menu items, and give you what you want. They are incredibly hard-working and efficient. Food is fresh and made to order

Cafe Beviamo never fails to disappoint, for that quick breaky or lazy lunch stop while shopping on Orchard. The varying daily soup is always delicious, and I love how accomodating they are with all menu items: everything can be halved and mixed up to suit your appetite and tastes. Beviamo is right on the money with service, quality food, and at excellent prices which is rare in Singapore and especially on the Orchard shopping belt. The butterscotch milkshake is a must try

@TheKuoKnowsBeviamo is not a bad place for a quick snack, if you happen to be in the Tanglin area.The Pepperoni Pizza was surprisingly good. It was also remarkably good value for money. For those who are health-conscious, the portion was just right, when accompanied by a salad.For a touch of decadence, the Blueberry Muffin provided just the right amount of "sin", with a cup of strong English Breakfast Tea on the side.Beaviamo gets the nod of approval from me. Can't wait for the next time I'm in Tanglin

We came based on recommendations & realised very quickly it's popular because it's convenient, not because its special & worth seeking out. One highlight was very good coffee, including piccolo lattes & they have decaf too. Food was uninspiring but ok, however our waitress couldn't explain how anything was prepared, so you will struggle to tailor to your needs. Clientele are predominantly pram pushing expats, so noise level can be high
5
This is an open plan style cafe/restaurant in Tanglin Shopping Mall. It's popular, which is always a good sign. Decent coffee, a reasonable choice of savouries and really nice cakes. The service is prompt, helpful and friendly. Prices are reasonable. I visited earlier in the year too (March) and the standard remains consistently high. I'm happy to recommend it
4
Had a nice salad w chicken.
Cappuccino and salad around SGD 25.
Tasty and decent portion.
For Singapore not really expensive, not really cheap. Quality is there so probably will return.
4
This cafe located in the centre of Tanglin Shopping Centres requires queuing for a seat at lunchtime but the wait is worth it. Selection is reasonable, pricing ok, but the bread used is very nice (focaccia or wholemeal) so good sandwiches and the variety of salads very interestin
5
I love Beviamo, after spending a week in China without any good coffee, we made a bee-line for Beviamo. (Having lived in Singapore in the past this is an expat favourite) This is the place to go for good coffee, milk shakes and lunches. The quality is consistently good and the place to go if you want to relax and enjoy a quality meal
5
They work very hard at consistently providing friendly service and good food, which in Singapore is out of the ordinary! As far as an open seating plan restaurant in a mall goes, they are one of our favourites, whether it's for breakfast/brunch, lunch or dinner.The menu doesn't change though which is the only real let down so it can be a bit disappointing. It seems their lack of storage and kitchen space doesn't allow them to change or add new items daily
5
Great place for a quick bite to eat in between shopping and running errands. The cafe is in the middle of a small mall, well known in the area for a variety of family friendly stores and activity centres. I highly recommend this cafe. The roast beef sandwich is excellent and wont disappoint. It is quite filling and in my view, the chutney just holds it all together. The beetroot salad was delicious and had the right balance of flavours comprising of the bitter rocket leaves and sweet roasted vegies and balsamic vinegar. I was also impressed with the coffee (I had a cappucino). Lastly, given the abundance of baby highchairs available and surrounding noise from shoppers walking by, the cafe is quite family friendly and so receives top marks from me
5
This is a very nice and reliable cafe in the middle of Tanglin Mall. There's a good selection of cooked food and salads as well as cake. The coffee is good too. They don't take reservations and there's often a queue at weekend lunchtimes, due to its popularity
5
I used to live in Singapore when I was a little girl (around 20 years ago) and we visited Tanglin Mall often. Nowadays it has changed so much, many of the shops that I remember from a long time ago are now gone and changed by others which I don't know that well. When strolling in the mall we decided to have a sandwich and coffee here - we were surprised with how delicious both the chicken sandwich and coffee were! This place is far from local Singaporean and rather European but we loved it. I was happy to see Expact families eating here, reminded me of my happy Singaporean childhood
4
Sandwiches and salads are great; good coffee (they make one of the best cappuccinos and lattes in Singapore). It tends to get very crowded with moms and babies, thus loud, which is a drawback if you don't belong to that demographic. Food wise, the quality is good
5
I used to come here almost daily while living in Singapore. I love their coffee and their scrambled eggs. The staff are usually excellent but service levels do drop a bit during very busy lunch period and Saturdays for example. It's very baby friendly with lots of space for high chairs and popular with local families
5
If you want to have great coffee and cake, beviamo will meet your expectations! Love love love it! For many years we used to go whilst living here, and after 6 years the quality is still the same, good coffee nice cakes good lunchfare. Not supercharming spot but the quality of the food makes up for that

Child friendly place at Tanglin Mall with good selection of breakfast options. Our hot chocolate and latte were good, and had a yummy Hawaiian Pizza and scrambled egg+toast meal. Saw lots of kids in the area and service was good. Recommended for families.
5
Hidden gems!
Order ravioli and penne sausage. All are delicious. Must try their coffee too! Cheaper than other place but 2x nicer. Good place to catch up with friends.
4
The spinach and cheese ravioli was fabulous and the pizza was nice too. I loved the cheese on the pizza, as it wasn't too heavy! The service was okay and the food came fast which was great. Had a nice meal in totality :)
5
This cafe is right in the middle of Tanglin Mall. This was my first time here and enjoyed and food.
The banana bread cake is a must try.
They do serve main course and wine.

My husband and I ordered a Hawaiian pizza and scrambled eggs on brown bread. Both are delicious! Simple food done well. The crust of the pizza is super thin and the ham cubes and pineapples toppings are ample. The scrambled eggs is yummy, not too watery or too dry. And the bread is fresh. Our latte and hot chocolate are also good. I don't like coffee that is too acidic and this Is just right. On a side note, I observed that other customers ordered half size servings for pasta which seems ok for small eaters and you can add avocado on the side for your eggs. Highly recommend for family with children too! Prices are reasonable.

The food is good. The service staff were professional. The cookies were cute! It was a busy Sunday and the staff did their part to serve the customers to their best! The seats were well spead out and they have an open kitchen concept, which is really interesting! Please, take time from your weekend and visit them.The coffee shop in the Tanglin shopping mall 服務非常好，食物選擇多餐點好吃。份量普通。會是想要再回來的店！唯一缺點，客人多使用率高，餐廳的裝修看的出有好些時間了。會有些陳舊的感覺
5
Great coffee; great food (please do yourself a favour and have the tomato bruschetta!) and a place perfect for a catch up with friends or to take the whole family for a yummy breakfast or lunch.Value for money in addition to good food quality - this has become a definite family favourite spot

This is a pleasant coffee shop in the upmarket Tanglin Mall in Singapore. It's frequented by that distinctive genus found usually in Asian cities like Singapore and Hong King, the "expatriate wives". The place was filled by various kaffeklatsches of this genus all gossiping away or taking selfies and we-fies.Although we were directed to a table quickly, the service after that was brusque and unsmiling. Menus tossed on the table, orders taken more than 10 minutes later, request for sugar at the counter answered by a peremptory "It's in front of you", getting and paying the cheque another 15 minutes.The coffee/tea was good, as well as the very small and pricey $3 cookie, ambience is nice too. However, the service has to be improved,not all of us can afford to linger over coffees for one hour while chatting away
1
I can't give a review of their food and beverage because their excellent service saw me walking out of the place before I even sat down. No one attended to us for a solid 5 minutes that we were standing there and only when we started looking around for service, a young man almost charged over to us and barked "have a seat". We didn't think much of it and went to seat ourselves. Before we got to the table we had selected, we heard a rude, loud "hi!" from behind us. It was the same young man, wearing an annoyed expression. He impatiently motioned to a table closer to him and repeated "have a seat". We said we'd like to sit at another one and he comes back with, "it's closed." Since there was no sign indicating that the section we were heading to was closed, we prompted him to confirm if he was sure that it's closed. He almost rolled his eyes and said, "we're going to do some cleaning. In awhile." Then raising his eyebrows, he motioned again to the table close to him in a manner that can only be described as condescending. At this point, my fiance and I left. Especially coming from the same industry, both of us found this kind of service to be an embarrassment. It is obvious that there is no interest, let alone heart in the people hired here to do their jobs. Such a pity to have these kind of people turn customers away. Truth be told, I wish to be able to rate them below terrible

Situtated at 163 Tanglin Road in Tanglin Mall - This is the best thing about Tanglin Mall - it made up for the dis-appointment at the range in the shops here.We just wanted a quick bite - so we had a cappucino and Americano with milk ( Flat white) at S$4.50 per cup - a Bruschetta at $12 and Soup of the Day -$6 The coffees were not really hot but were quite tasty - the Bruschetta comprised of fresh tomato and basil and were sensational - fresh and tasty on perfectly toasted bread.The soup was pumpkin- large chunks of pumpkin and carrot floating in a thick soup also very tasty and accompanied by a toasted mini baguette - my only critique was that the soup itself was a bit thick and maybe needed blitzing a few minutes longer - but some like it like that - so it is a preference thing.Total for lunch $28.89 - quite acceptable -Service was prompt and efficent - highly recommend this as a place to grab a bite

Excellent quality of freshly prepared Italian style food at Tanglin Mall. Good price-value ratio. Worth a detour!
4
Whenever visiting Singapore always drop in with my wife. Service always good, & food very tasty with a home cooked flavor. Good value.
5
Walk over 15 mins just to try out this cafe. Worth every effort!Beef bolognese spaghetti is one of the best if not the very best I've eaten! Cooked to the perfect italian way. A cup of americano completed the perfect meal.Live up to the hype ;

1. The bill was placed on our table by waiter 1 even though we were not even midway through our meals. 2. The bill was incorrect. It had two additional items which we did not order. 3. Waitress 1 brought coffee which we did not order.4. Waitress 2 came to bring the coffee away and when we showed our unhappiness, she quickly responded by saying "I am just a server".5. Waitress 2 came to collect the bill. I told her we did not order the two items. She came back a second time with only one item deleted and I had to point out the mistake again. 6. Neither waitress 1 nor 2 gave a single apology for the mistakes and bad service rendered. This was one of the worst service I have experienced in a cafe/restaurant in Singapore in recent years. It was appalling
4
We use this cafe for breakfast when staying at Traders hotel. We prefer something light after long haul travel and this suits us pefectly.This week my wife had scrambled egg"just perfect" and I had a delicious muesli. Service was prompt and staff work hard. Agree with other reviewers this appears to be a meeting place for ex pat mums with children but that was fine by us
4
My grandchildren love the pizzas here and the desserts. The staff are very attentive and very cooperative with special requests since one of my grandchildren is allergic to many things! It gets full easily and they don't take reservations so do come early! Very good soups and salads too
5
A must stop for me whenever I am in Singapore. Menu is simple but with good selection of all day breakfast, salad, sandwiches and some hot dishes.Food prepare a la minute in an open kitchen and also with consistent good standard. Service is efficient even they are so busy all the time. This place is full and need to wait for table most of the time from opening until late afternoon. Staff are moving around fast to serve guests.It is amazing with good standard even with high volume of business and there is no manager around to supervise. This place run by itself and it works wonder

While Tanglin Mall is a somewhat surreal experience given it being over populated with expats and children, should you find yourself near there or indeed in there and require some refreshment then Cafe Beviamo is a good choice. Aside from the fact that you sit right in the middle of the mall, its nicely decorated in soothing dark browns and wood finishes. The coffee is exceptionally well made, and while the menu is limited it is all very fresh. The chicken and avocado salad with almond flakes is a refreshing option and the all day breakfast makes this a good place to have brunch or late breakfast. Service is ok but not super friendly. The babychino is a delight and who doesnt like lots of froth and chocolate powder - keeps the kids happy after all
5
Not a huge menu, but enough to tempt me back several times. Best scrambled egg in Singapore. Everything prepared from fresh local ingredients It's in Tanglin Mall beyond the top of Orchard Road and gets busy at lunch times so you may have to wait for a tabl
4
I had heard that this restaurant has Australian owners who were looking to bring the concept of the Australian bistro to Singapore - meaning good quality food and simple. It lives up to its reputation. Coffee was good, food was fresh and good. An overall good meal and not outrageously expensive. I will say that the service lacked. It took us a good 15 minutes to get the bill and the table next to us got the wrong bill
4
I have discovered where all the expat wives go when the husbands go to work! Cafe Beviamo for coffee and breakfast! It's very pleasant, food is nice, service good and full of expats. Nuff said
5
We always have lunch or just coffees at this cafe in the Tanglin Mall whenever we visit Singapore, it is just the place to relax and enjoy good food or just coffee and cake. The service comes with a smile and the food/coffee is excellent.
4
We ate here twice in a few days - first time because we wanted something light, then returned because of the first positive experience. The staff are friendly & helpful.
1
Today i arranged a coffee morning with the other mothers from school. The location Tanglin was decided and after looking in the internet found Cafe Beviamo. it was disappointing to say the least and was most embarrassing having chosen this place. The order was not taken immediately. When the order came, it was almost thrown onto the table. Everything came separately even though we asked for it to come together. There were enough waiters but they just didn't seem interested to attend to us. I would not recommend this to anyone got a coffee morning with friends
3
Food was acceptable - ravioli, salmon salad, leek soup.Coffee was average. Limited wine list.Service, though was friendly, was bit frantic and not attentive.Can be quite noisy in the weekend, with children screaming on both ends of the cafe. Mostly expats. Says a lot
5
I have been going to Beviamo now at each of my visits to Singapore, usually several times. Perhaps I first went there because of the ease of access but now return for the good food in a lovely setting without any stiffness. The place is simple and elegant, even casual, yet unmistakably classy. The menu offers sandwiches (all of them on home-made bread), excellent cumin-spiced hummus, soup of the day, pizza and paninis. While this may not sound amazing, here it actually is. The freshness of the food is perfect and there are many excellent options for vegetarians. The short wine list is very nice indeed. Strongly recommend for a relaxed lunch with a friend or a casual business-related conversation. Children are welcome as well. Overall relaxed and friendly ambiance, good value as the freshness and the ingredients are superb. Well situated close to Traders hotel and the Botanic Gardens inside the Tanglin mall. Always a good experience
4
We had breakfast here every day and it was very good and reasonable price and set us up for the day. I love the fresh orange juice and the fruit with yogurt and honey was great. There's no full English type of breakfast but what they do will keep you going till lunch or dinner time and its FRESH and cooked well. Staff are great as well.
5
This cafe is on the first floor of the Tanglin Mall one can excess straight from the 2nd floor of the Traders Hotel. Often very busy because food is really good and prices reasonable. And the portions are substantial. Try their avocado&chicken salad or Pavlova! One of the best lattes around.
4
Great place for a nice sandwich/soup on a weekday if you are sick of the food court. Do go early or late to avoid the crowd, as its a very popular lunch spot in this part of town. I love all of their veggie sandwiches and note that you can order almost all the items in half portions :) Good service, great food and to top it off - no service charge, do tip when they deserve it :

This place is great for good value good size breakfast. We go here at least twice a month for the Gluten free muesli and fresh fruit. My husband says the coffee is good too! I eat Gluten free so it is a delight to be able to go somewhere in Singapore for breakfast and have something other than eggs by themselves
