Great Atmosphere, great food!
Ask for the pork ribs and Shrimps and the famous lemon hummus!
Ask for Gopal! Best host ever!!

Having booked this because we like Robertson Quay and it was recommended by the Daily Telegraph, great star, great matre di but sorry over priced and not good value, do four tiny two inch long bits of sardine constitute a starter, does the chicken come without peas and they tired to serve it as we still eat a starter, but one bottle of wine, some hummus, three meat balls, shadows of sardine and a bit chicken do not even in Singapore amount to 90 Sterling, you even pay for tap water, it may have conned the locals but regular travellers through Singapore like us will revert to the splendour of Bella Pasta just down the roa

A chance choice on the riverfront at Robertson quay. We had good seats where we could watch the world go by.Appetiser was a Shared platter of hummus and lamb dip with Turkish bread.A fantastic blend of flavours and enjoyed by both of us.One ordered chicken and one ordered sea trout. Both were delicious and well prepared.Be aware you may need to order sides if you would like more vegetables.A very filling and tasty meal in a great location.Highly recommended
5
Beasides a good selection of food with quintessential taste, the staff here are very friendly and attentive. When I complimented their steam mussel (this is a fantastic dish that I would recommend it to everyone with their baked pumpkin and sausage), Gopal invited the main chef, Bernard, to come and talk to us. It is delightful that they take much pride in their work and it makes customers like me keep coming back to this beautiful restaurant

Located along the revamped Robertson Quay area is Summerlong which serves rly tasty Mediterranean food.We booked a table for 10 online and was initially a little peeved with the compulsory $500 credit card "deposit" because very rarely do Sg restaurants require this but decided to book anyway cos my friends really wanted to try it.Portions are small but excellent for sharing and the menu is very extensive.Service staff excellent as well and very attentive.I will definitely return
5
Loved the vibe, we literally felt like we had left Singapore for a while.Food was amazing, off the dinner menu the Octopus is something definitely not to be missed. Cooked to absolutely perfection! The Cypriot Burger is the must try for brunch - the lamb patty is so fresh and marinated so beautifully.Aside the food, the service is impeccable, the staff was so friendly. Already looking forward to my next visit

We went with family friends. Kids had fun because the location is such. They took there scooters and bikes and kept riding up down. The food was good. Wide variety for selection and they did a special vegetarian dish for us too. But for 6 adults and just scrambled /folded eggs the bill was 220$ So definitely expensiv
1
I took 3 friends out to dinner and decided upon this place. Spend almost a hundred per person and we left hungry and completely unsatisfied. It wouldn’t be so bad if the food was decent but there was nothing that stood out.
3
It’s a very nice location with outdoor seating next to the river. Food is good especially their hummus pita! Beer was disappointing with erdinger draft being served in regular water glasses ! Enjoyed the evening but for the price and the shabby beer mugs !
5
My first review for any Singapore restaurant. This was my 4th visit to SummerLong & it’s have been a great consistent experience. Amazing service and Awesome middle eastern food- options available for Vegans also. Outside seating is great in the evenings - good view and cool breeze. This place stands out as it invites you and the team at the restaurant creates an amazing overall experience. Innovative bartender & great cocktails!! Need to mention the usherer - very inviting, helpful and accommodating - we insisted on outside seating - it was just the two of us - still he seated us on a bigger table outside. His smile and joy were infectious - he was great with making suggestions for the food too.Overall a great experience- would recommend to all. And yes - the place is children friendly
4
Delicious Mediterranean food with a twist and good service. It was so comfy we sat there for 2.5 hours and no one pressured me to leave.
5
Service is super friendly and efficient here. Food was delicious as well, and we love the cocktails. Will definitely come back. I think it's busier/more buzzing on a Friday night.
5
Service was amazing. The staff made us felt so welcome and was super attentive. Food was ok but will def be back
3
Portions were small and very pricey - not worth the value. Ambience is chill and befitting of a lazy Sunday.
4
love the clams as they come in huge sizes and are really fresh. They also provide free flow sparkling water at $1
1
Not a great experience with the quality of food and especially the breads !!! They are trying to be an mid eastern restaurant but have muddled it up badly . The location and ambience is great though 
4
Really enjoyed our dinner here. The food was delicious and well priced, although the portion sizes were a bit small, even for sharing. Relaxed vibe and great location. Staff were very attentive
5
We came here on a Saturday morning for brunch; we were 5 adults and 1 infant. We had some questions on the food items, and the waiter patiently and precisely explained the items and answered our questions, leaving no room for misunderstanding later, which I personally fully appreciate.The food was great, especially what we had: Hummus, Calamari, Folded eggs, Blueberry Pancakes. The Cypriot burger was too tall and juicy to eat by hand, and was a challenge to eat, but still tasted good. For drinks, although they charge a dollar for water, this was clearly stated on the menu and explained to us, and it went to a good cause and was free flow, so that was cool with us. Their espresso-based coffees were good and so was the green apple juice, but I wouldn't recommend the bullet proof coffee as it didn't feel like anything extraordinary.My kid is the type who can't stay still for long, and although the seating arrangement in the restaurant was slightly unspacious, there was still room for her to walk around and not bother other diners. It was also convenient to just step out for a bit and take a short walk along the Singapore River during the meal.Overall, we spent about $35 per person, which was worth it for the food and service that we had, and the location
4
Ambience and service was fantastic. But they should improve on the kid's meal which tasted like processed food and its a tad too salty
5
Consistent and delicious food. So many things to try on the menu. This is my fourth visit and I will be back. Light Mediterranean dishes the perfect for warm nights and a decent drinks menu. The service is the only down point. A tireless manager but the rest of the staff actively avoid making eye contact when you try to get service.
5
It was full at 1PM, a testimony to its popularity. The menu is more like full day breakfast, with smoke salmon and eggs, pancakes and the Turkish breakfast special. All very well excited with very friendly staff.
5
Went for dessert in Summerlong. Tried their Octopus after hearing raving reviews about it. Did not disappoint! One of the best Octopus I ever had. The flavours, texture and taste were all on point. Will be back just for the Octopus.
5
Passed by Summerlong whilst walking my dog and pushing my baby’s pram. I noticed a sign saying something about pets and assumed, like most restaurants in Singapore, that dogs were not welcome but on the contrary.I sat at a table outside and was served by Azman, a very keen and polite server...another rarity in the Singapore F&B industry. As the name suggests, sat here I could have been quite easily in Bali. The place is laid back and inviting.I only ordered a few bites as it was mid-afternoon. I went for their marinated olives (generous portion!) and chilli hummus which was served with a very soft naan like bread.These are the same people behind Neon Pigeon and Fat Prince
5
I have been to this place twice and have to say it’s consistently good. The food is tapas style and sharing so it keeps the variety in what you eat. The ingredients are fresh. I have always come here with groups of people and really enjoyed the experience. With wine and food it’s not a bad deal aT all. Would absolutely come back
5
Great new restaurant with some different flavours and dishes compared to some of the run of the mill restaurants that are along Robertson Quay. Small plates are good to share to try a few different things. I liked the burratina, lamb spring rolls, grilled chicken cooked to perfection, Brussels sprouts and chorizo crumbs...all delicious.
3
Nothing special and quite expensive. The only goods things are location and good interior. Can’t recommend
4
Food was delicious with great flavours. Tried several dishes but the few that stood out were the pork ribs, broccoli salad, hummus, Brinjal starter and fried chicken. We got a outdoor table facing the river which was nice. Service could improve as they were slow. Good place for a family get together.
5
What a great find, excellent food and such great value for money. The food was absolutely delicious....hummus, fried chicken and a lamb burger. We chilled outside for a few hours brunching and looking at all the lovely dishes being served around us......everything looked great and we will definitely be going back. I found the service excellent from the minute I walked up to the front.....thank you Julian and his staff for looking after us both
1
Service is horrible ... super slow with lip service...This past weekend was my second and last visit there..Place was half empty and yet our food took forever to arrive.I walked up to inquire and saw our food on the counter getting cold. The guy in charge said he'd sort it out.Walked up a second time and the guy was actually Julian, the manager. He said he will take care of it and send the food out immediately. No need to stand there. I insisted to wait as the first inquiry resulted in lip service and he gave me yet more.. thank goodness I did. The waiter came by to fetch for a delivery and had I not been there the kids food I explicitly pointed out would have been left behind.Sorry. Never going back here..
5
I visited Summerlong twice in the last 10 days. Both times I can only praise the staff and the kitchen for such a great evening.The location with its outside lounge seating and indoor tables is beautifully decorated. The food a delight to try and share with friends. The service highly attentive and perfect.Thank you to the host Sam and his team. A great thank you to Ghani for the recommendations and service
5
Attentive staffs. Had a pleasant dining experience. Food was great. Request attended to and communication was easy.
5
Friendly, kind staff and perfect recommendation from the senior bartender Chris. Would definitely come again. Thank you Chris for giving me a great hospitality to both me and my girlfriend
5
Went back to Summerlong after a while and was very impressed; I couldn’t believe that service, drinks and food could get better than on my last visit, but the team around Julian, the manager, has been able to do exactly that! Great experience, keep up the good work
4
Great atmosphere, location and crew.Food was really good, just super - small servings.Beer selection terrible. Price ok by SG standard se, though not great value due to the small sizes of the dishes.
4
With family arriving from SriLanka and doing a lot of shopping we decided we needed some energy to make sure the girls could enjoy and keep going for the remainder of the day.We decided on Summerlong at Robertson Quay, which was our first time there.I have to say it was delightful.The restaurant part of the Quay makeover, is right in front of the singapore river, it has bright modern furnishings, open kitchen with energetic helpful and smiling staff.The brunch menu is healthy and provides sufficient number of choices. The food was fresh and enjoyable.Coffee was good and all 7 of us enjoyed the time there.We will retur
4
Had a wonderfully relaxing meal on a Sunday night. A perfect environment for a family outing to a romantic couples evening to good times with Friends. Julian was helpful in every way... from the menu selection to pairings. The burratina with tangerine and honey is a must try. There are a few really good Mediterranean restaurants in Singapore. This was was Mediterranean with a twist. Service was top notch. Courses were delightfully plated and we were left to savor every bite without feeling rushed or ignored. We will definitely be returning to try the Octopus
4
Summerlong is an open concept restaurant. Fun, casual vibe - a great place to hang out, if there is a breeze (no aircon). They charge $1 (refillable) for water, but donate the money to charity, which is fine. The food was generally fantastic (try the labneh with bread, burratina, trout), but the Persian fried chicken was a let down. On the pricey side. But we had an enjoyable evening.
5
Best place to get mediterranean food in Singapore! Just love the ambience, and the drinks and food are delicious
1
Everything about the experience was wrong. Our original table was next to a hammock occupied by kids who thought it was a swing in a park. Fortunately, we could move. Note to designer; nobody wants to eat while a hammock swings to and from your face! We ordered food, only to be told most was unavailable. What we could order arrived randomly, served with no care, or attention, garnished with human hair and served at various temperatures. The staff didn’t seem to care, they smiled a lot and said they understood it was bad, but did nothing to rectify the situation. At sgd 309.00 it was a big bill for what really was rubbish. To their credit they gave us 50% off, but only after we threatened to walk away. I don’t normally comment as running a restaurant is hard enough, but this was abysmal. The app asks me to give a rating! One star is being generous.
2
Great location on Robertson Quay with modern interior. That's where the good points endService was poor and uncoordinated, food just came as if we all ordered separately (9 of us)Staff were poor, one even said as they bought some meals over 'I just need to know whose it is'The menu was poor and the portions smallOverpriced rubbish all round. Would not even bother trying agai
4
Friendly service and food was great. Food preparation speed could be improved further. Place can be cooler with more air-conditioned service.
5
Great spot to while away an evening watching the world go by, so many scooters! Staff are brilliant, very friendly and welcoming. Food is ultra tasty, lots to select from.
4
Beautifully decorated resturant . Has a very laid back yet chic vibe about it . Interesting take on Mediterranean food . Could improve on it a bit . Good service
4
3 dishes great
calamari not really edible
customer service - could be improved - while the gentlemen are very attentive , the ladies were rather sluggish and seemed not bothered
music - could be more neutral - it was for younger guests
5
Yet another amazing meal at Summerlong. Love the laid back vibe, refreshing cocktails and friendly staff. Don't leave without trying the fried chicken and ribs. :)
5
The food, drinks, ambience, cleanliness, staff's service attitude and staff attentiveness were awesome. Definitely coming back again!
4
Great ambience; fans kept the place cool despite being alfresco. Fantastic cocktails and tasty food. The octopus, kale salad and hummus were yummy. Pricing very reasonable for the quality. Great place for social gatherings. Will be back!
5
We enjoyed a great Sunday brunch with friends at this spacious and well run restaurant on the waterfront at Robertson Quay. Something for everyone with an interesting kids menu (our 9yo loved the pie!). And my wife and I enjoyed the buffet. Very filling and a good mix of salads and some protein. And good coffee as well. A good option.
5
Ordered the Lemon Garlic hummus, which came with the softest warm pita I have ever had the pleasure of having. The Sardines were smothered in a lovely dressing but, as with any sardine dish, the tiny bones were a bit of a bother. The Meatballs were average. Cocktails were delicious (but not strong at all unfortunately). The star of the day was definitely the Burratina, which is drizzled with honey and topped with slices of tangerine. I sliced it down the middle, and first layer of this cheese ball oozed out with the consistency of a poached egg which, as we all know, is rather satisfying to watch. But the real surprise came when scooped a spoonful into our mouths. The burst of flavour and texture was truly divine, the honey paired surprisingly well with the cheese. If you don't have a sweet tooth, I would recommend scooping up just a tiny bit of the honey with the cheese.The atmosphere of Summerlong is the real draw in my opinion. It is marketed as a beach cafe in the heart of Robertson Quay. While this does not necessarily come across, especially if you are there in the evening, the atmosphere was wonderful - buzzing but relaxing at the same time. I would go back there for the atmosphere. And the service was pretty commendable as well!
2
The food that we had was quite nice but the kids meals were the tiniest ever-not enough for our 7 year old let alone our 10 year old! And agree with another reviewer regarding small amount of bread provided with the hummus. Once the kids had finished-and even including a trip to a nearby hotel to use their toilets-our main courses had not arrived. We chased them up and were told they were coming and still did not appear so we just paid for what we'd had and left. Had to go elsewhere as the kids were still starving let alone the 2 of us. Very disappointing
5
Great service, great food, great location. You feel very welcome. Atmosphere is good. We will be back.
4
Think tapas, burrata, hummus . Fairly new on the scene , but a great experience. Good food, excellent service and great location, overlooking the river. Return ? Definitely!
4
Absolutely fantastic food - and they're very open and willing to accommodate food allergies. It's an open seating concept, so dress for warm weather - although they have fans, but it's definitely not cold in the restaurant.
4
We came here by chance and were pleasantly surprised. The food was good and service was great. When my order came and was peanuts on it, they quickly took it away and served me another meal. Very good experience all around.
5
Love the atmosphere at this restaurant, awesome food, although a little pricey. Highlight was the soft serve yoghurt!!!
5
I've visited Summerlong a few times now and it gets better each time. The staff are improving and Julian at front of house is doing a great job. I love the brunch menu and the option of the daily salads and treats.
4
Yummy mains, and incredibly good value dessert guarantees that we will be back. The hummous was an extreme let down, there was a very decently sized portion of hummous, but 4 slivers of flatbread (Why not arabic bread? I cannot get over the fluffeh flatbread) Additional bread is charged at 3 dollars for another 4 small slivers? Why not charge me 10 dollars or 8 pieces of bread up front? Chicken and Pork Ribs are most excellent indeed
3
This place should tick all the boxes, but it just doesn't. Great location on the river in Robertson Quay. Pretty decor. Nice and open and a great place to prop and watch the procession parade past in the warm Singapore evenings. However...the food is ok, not great, or bad, just ok. Wine list is fair, although the wine we ordered was not available on the night and it was a Friday night, not like they ran out after a busy weekend or anything. It's the service that lets this place down. Amateurish at best, the staff are clumsy and inattentive. You kinda get used to low levels of service in Singapore, but you don't have to put up with it. Pouring my own wine is fine, but at least clear the table promptly and efficiently. It should not be a challenge to clear and carry multiple plates at the same time, in fact it is a basic skill in hospitality. The intent is definitely there with this place and with some improvements in the menu and the service it will be top notch. It's just not there yet.
2
I had high hopes for the new Summerlong restaurant - the vibe looked cool, the people who hung out there looked good, and it has a nice location. However, right away, I should have known to walk away. Before I had even sat down, the hostess asked me if I had ever been to the restaurant before. I thought she was going to tell me about the cuisine, or maybe the ordering recommendation, but instead she told me that she would be charging me a dollar for water! I should left right then. Things didn't get better. The staff seemed completely out of it. At one point, one of the waiters came over and placed a "reserved" sign on our table (I had made a reservation). He meant to set it on the empty table next to us! Unfortunately, the experience was not salvaged by the food. It was, to be honest, terrible. Not only was it unappetising, it was utterly forgettable. We ate it all only because we were very hungry. Chargrilled octopus was virtually raw; hummus was runny; eggplant was chewy. To make matters even worse, both my husband and I had stomach troubles the whole night. I will say that it was a waste of a meal, a waste of money and a complete waste of our time
3
Looked forward to going given what other restaurants these guys are involved in. Have to say I walked away thinking this must be a franchise..... service wasn't good maybe one good dish however the rest left a little to be desired. Don't think we will be going back soon unless some drastic changes as there are plenty of other choices severing this cuisine
5
They have a gluten free menu which was great and food was delicious. They were also proactive to offer cucumber to my friend so she can join me in enjoying the hummus.
4
Plenty of service, lovely riverside ambience. Food was bit hit and miss, great grilled octopus and hummus, average lamb spring rolls, sardines on toast is an acquired taste. Would recommend for group outings.
5
Summerlong is fantastic! Not only is their food delicious, it's a restaurant where you can just hang out at the bar, go with friends or bring your family! Also, the head bartender, Irwan, will impress you with his creative cocktails.
2
We made sure to book since we really wanted to enjoy the gorgeous outside tables by the quay. Sadly, we were 5 minutes late and were told our table was not available anymore, which is quite surprising, but hey, we were hungry so chose another one. Moving on to the food, given the neon Pigeon inspiration and co, we were expecting an original and Creative menu. Apart from the mushroom tajine, nothing was out of the ordinary - fried calamari, plain oysters, hummus, fried chicken - hence disappointing.Service was along the same line: we had to ask several times for bread (hummus material), water & co.... All in all, wouldn't go back there for food, maybe a drink by one of those outside tables - that's it
3
The food is good, the atmosphere is great. The service is not bad but we think that the wait staff was too enthusiastic, keep coming to us to see that if we are ok thus keep interrupting us catching up with one another in a sense.
2
I am just not sure why this place is always packed.....the food is not that good, the portions are small and doesn't feel worth the price. Yes, the ambience is great but it seems like just another place people would want to instagram, and that's it. The staff are okay, they were a bit slow and hard to get their attention. Nothing to get excited about.
5
So to start off the food was delicious:- The hummus which the staff recommends are fantastic (especially if compared with what they serve next door at SPRMKT). If I had to pick I'd go with the traditional chickpea with lamb but the sweet potato is surprisingly good too. - The grilled octopus is out of this world, not a trace of the rubbery texture you get in so many places and just the charred taste with perfect hint of sweet honey. - The burratina another delicious balance of delicate flavours and textures. - The meatballs, while no ground-braking recipe, well executed with the juicy tomato sauce to complement the otherwise slightly dry but tasty meatballs. - The striploin is a reasonable quantity of top quality meat cubed and perfectly grilled. Perfect for sharing. - The aptly highlighted fried chicken, not greasy yet crispy outside and juicy meat inside, with the mint sauce to round it off beautifully.So if the food is a 10/10 the service has to be a 11/10 with super attentive and friendly staff which are always there just when you need them, without excessive hovering or asking to refill drinks prematurely.And the outdoors yet air-conditioned location by the water is just perfect to hang out for hours on end.Needless to say I'll be back soon
3
Part of the refurbished Quayside at Robertson. The food was very mixed in quality- the sweet potato hummus was unusual and good, though the accompanying pita didn't taste fresh. A couple of us were vegetarian but the vegetarian main wasn't available so we ordered the broccoli, aubergine and 2 salads (Arabian and Pear Fennel). The salads were good but the other two were just salty. The trout was excellent and the grilled prawns seemed a bit overcooked. The yoghurt soft serve was very good. Service was good - although more with the water top ups rather than the food!Ambience is good as it's on the river However noise levels are quite high and it's difficult to have a conversation given the seating layout and the noise.
5
Summerlong is definitely a place to go for semi-casual vibes and great great share plates. This is one place where the drinks really lived up to its name! not diluted, great flavours. The food was extremely well done as well. Hummus as a starter was greatBroccoli was nicely seasoned Smoked pork ribs had a nice spicy touch to it. A real winnerOctopus was cooked well, not rubberyFritters were nicely done with a great sauceI cannot rave enough about this place. Great concept
4
Went with my 13 and 16 year old daughters and shared a few plates. Very nice atmosphere and suspect it would be a great spot for a larger group to share plates and drink the evening away. Views re the food were mixed. The calamari was average. The braised lamb with apricots and lentils in pastry was delicious as were the corn and goats cheese fritters. A main of roast chicken wasn't memorable. Soft serve yoghurt was pretty good.
5
Located next to river the restaurant has a great location for dinner. Trout and French fries thoroughly recommended. Great for those wanting some spice with their food. Good selection of Mediterranean dishes.
5
Awesome food and wine, exceeding my expectations. Navin made great recommendations and we enjoyed a great dinner with warm ambience. Check it out.
2
We went for Sunday brunch. The place has a cool vibe. The menu is very limited for vegetarians and they were even out of the very few veg dishes mentioned on the menu.
Won't be going back.
5
Best service on the river by far. The staff and management make sure everything is to your liking.
The hummus, fava beans, octopus, strip loin and broccoli are AMAzINg!!
We keep coming back and it keeps getting better!
4
A cozy place with good atmosphere, very good service, good vibes but it is kinda pricey 😅 Make sure you make reservation and request for the outdoor table to enjoy the river view.

I have been meaning to try the new restaurant in Robertson Quay. At a loose end one Friday evening I called to see if they had any tables available, this was around 7pm. I was told no but quite a few people finishing up so should have plenty available in 30 minutes. I asked if he would hold a table under our name and I was told not necessary so we make our way over and of course there were no tables available, Nor would there be for a while so i left my number and did get a call in about 30 minutes. The front hostess was actually quite nice.We ordered the octopus share plate to start, it had a nice flavour the texture was ok, however the size was TINY, certainly not a "share" plate and small for even a normal appetiser. We both ordered the trout from the "grill and plancha" part of the menu, again this serve was so small it was ridiculous, smaller than a regular appetiser. It felt smoked, certainly not grilled and it was served with this liquid sauce, I have no idea what it was however all it did was liquified the mashed pea making it soup like. It was served cold, or tepid which was weird.The trout was nice flavour, without the liquid which made it confusing however the size was ridiculous, it would be smaller than a kids serve however priced like a regular main, still hungry we considered ordering more however this place felt like a joke. After spending $112.00 for one and a half courses, we left hungry and went straight to McDonald's on the way home, which we have never done before. We are actually not big eaters both my Husband and I are quite slim but the serving sides was crazy and expensive for what it is.Would think twice before going back Also, We were served water, without being asked and without being told there was a charge, very deceptive! And $1 each! Service was also inconsistent, had to ask twice for the bill and entree was delivered to the wrong table
5
My husband and I went there for dinner on Saturday, the place has a cool vibe. We ordered drinks and food, and were served the appetizer and first course, but not the pitcher we had ordered. After checking with our waiter, he double checked with the bar and came back with our drink promptly. He said he was sorry for the waiting time and that we should not wait that long for a pitcher and that it was on him (worth $50!). We were very surprised (and pleased of course!). Our food was delivered in record time and was delicious, from start to finish! Staff was very friendly and attentive. We enjoyed every minute of our dinner and will definitely come back for more
5
Went to Summerlong last night for a reunion with friends I hadn't seen for a while. Between the super friendly staff, seamless running operations, amazing food and generally great vibe, we ended up staying until closing time and having a great time. Would definitely recommend the place for anybody looking for great mediterranean food in a fun and relaxed atmosphere. The French manager has the place purring like a well oiled race car!
5
Not one single complain on any of the dishes. We ordered a few plates to share; the octopus, the labneh, meatballs, calamari, burratina... All so yum! Then the shared mains, absolute deliciousness! The cod, garlic prawns, short ribs, and of course, who can forget the Persian Chicken. The sides and salads also very good.And to top it all, service was amazing. Susan was attentive, informative, but never intrusive. Will definitely be back
4
Had a great evening at summerlong. The restaurant has a great vibe and is well located in the robertson quay area. Good food options, also for vegetarians. We had a few starters to share between our dinner party and same for the mains. All dishes lean themselves to be shared but you can equally just order a starter and main. Portions are generous and service is great
5
Excellent ambience with a lovely twist on Mediterranean food. As the tag line rightly says...beachside vibe with Mediterranean soul.
Food is tasty and the cocktails are excellent.
5
Just loved the place ... they have just opened, but it's the perfect formula of well trained people, delicious food, varied offerings and wonderful atmosphere by the river!!
5
this was a great dining experience, great design complemented with great food. this is definitely a place I would come back time and time again
5
First step into this place, you'll instantly feel welcomed and as if you're actually inside a beach resto/bar. This place is about casual vibe, friendly staff, great food and (my personal fave) great cocktails! Perfect place to end my nights or start the day with their weekend brunch
5
I've already been to this new place for a few times (since the moment it opened around 1.5 months ago), and should say that it is probably the best option in Robertson Quay area. Great atmosphere, friendly and attentive staff, delicious food, wide range of drinks. Suits for both family and friends gatherings. The place is already quite popular, and gets pretty busy, especially on Fridays/Saturdays. So would recommend booking in advance before going there
3
Food was good- very tasty- the menu is made up in part of sharing plates.. But the serves were tiny for the price (2 meatballs for $16, for example.) Cocktails reasonably priced but seemed a bit watered down. Service was at best average. This place has heaps of potential- great location and tasty food, but I wouldn't go back- felt it was just too overpriced for a very average experience
4
We had brunch here on Sunday with 2 friends. It's a nice slightly upmarket place in Robertson Quay that you can take your dogs. Although it's child and pet friendly, it's not chaotic / noisy and is still a place that all adult groups can enjoy a meal over a bottle of wine.We had a couple of dishes to share - really enjoyed the sweet potato hummus which was really tasty, and the kale salad which was an interesting mix of flavours; we did not really enjoy the calamari which was a little tough with too much batter. Bottles of wine and coffee are well priced and the wait staff are very attentive. I'd definitely return here for a chilled meal with the dog but the chilled pet friendly atmosphere are the main draws as opposed to the food
2
The food here is really good. Prices are not too bad. But the service is absolutely pathetic. The staff will manage to get pretty much everything wrong
3
The people here are friendly but most of the staff are not trained at all and look terrified if you ask for something not immediately apparent( like black pepper-incredibly they had none!).There is a big open kitchen with a big team who manage to produce very indifferent food from a limited menu. A lamb burger was so-so and underseasoned served without the advertised pickle. Hardly anything on the menu is truly enticing and if you do not like soft serve ice cream then no dessert for you! The drinks list is also very limited with a most unappealing list of cocktails.This is a place that means well but should really sharpen up their act in a big way.A very amateur enterprise
5
Had dinner on a Saturday night. Venue was 80% full and service was smooth. Very friendly waiter Hannah brought out all food on timely basis. Favorites were labneh, hummus with minced lamb and marinated ribs. Drinkwise the Summer Mule is my favorite. Overall great new addition to Robertson which will look even better once all surrounding construction is finally done
