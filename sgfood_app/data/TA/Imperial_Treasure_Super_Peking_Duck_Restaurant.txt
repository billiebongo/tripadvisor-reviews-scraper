Enjoyed this restaurant over the Chinese New Year Period. The service was excellent and every dish ordered good perfectly and tasted great.
Peking duck was a highlight, one of my favourites.
We previously enjoyed the Paragon restaurant location as well, and would happily recommend both.

Personal review of this restaurant:Food: AveragePrice: AcceptableQuality: AverageService: Could have been better but friendliness good, product knowledge good, service standard averageAmbience: Above AverageFrankly, I expected better. Its like any other Chinese Restaurant, nothing special.What I would recommend is Peking Duck and that's about it. The staff can assist you with your order if you have no idea what to fill your stomach with. The restaurant is kind of cramped and while the staff are friendly, the service style is kind of 'not cordinated'. I'd give this place a miss. Its not a must dine restaurant. *the only picture available

A new friend that we met in Indonesia told us that we should try this restaurant for a great Peking Duck dinner. I had wanted to try this dish since hearing it raved about on an Anthony Bourdain episode years ago. Well, my husband and I were not let down. The duck was perfectly crispy on the outside and tender and moist on the inside. The presentation of all of the various dishes that are made from this one dish was amazing. My favorite was the lite "tortilla" like bread that you place the thinly sliced slivers of duck in along with scallion and cucumber slices and the dark brown sauce just make it delectable! Mind you this dish is enough to feed easily four adults so, if it's just two of you, you will have leftovers. Oddly enough, even though this restaurant is situated in the Marina Bay Sands hotel complex, there were not many westerners there at all eating. Most of the wait staff speak very little English as the bulk of the patrons are Asian and they know where to find the best Asian foods. If you found this review helpful, please give me a helpful vote. Thank you for reading and "chiah hok" (eat well, enjoy good food)

The food are great, service of the waiter and waitress are good, the waiting time to be seated is just ok. Most of guests made reservations but the way the restaurant handle the waiting list could be done with a better and professional way Overall still a great place with good food to visit

Came to this restaurant because it was touted as serving the best peking duck in Singapore. I was not let down. The Peking duck was good. However, the experience was marred when they restricted the number of pieces of lettuce leaves that we could have. There were 4 of us. When the san choy pow (from the leftover duck) came, it was accompanied by 4 pieces of lettuce leaves. when we finished the lettuce leaves, I asked for more lettuce as there were some more minced duck left. We were told we can only have 3 more pieces. I was rather shocked at this. It seems rather petty to be restricting the number of lettuce leaves that I could have. The restaurant categorised itself as fine dining. Surely it should have some confidence in its diners not asking for more than necessary! What was it thinking? That we were going to ask for a whole head of lettuce and bring it home?Another incident was when it came to desserts, the girl who took our orders simply shouted our orders across the room to her colleague to key in the order! Not the proper behaviour for a fine dining restaurant

I have been three times now and have very much enjoyed the duck each time I am in Singapore. Tasty, well prepared and expertly served. The food is very high quality (if unimaginative). The setting is quite nice but a little generic. Go here for the excellent duck - probably appropriate for a business meal than a place I would choose for going out with family
5
Be sure to book a table here for either the 11:30 or the 1 pm settings. Get the Peking duck. You will not regret. They wrap individually for you so you don't even have to spend the time pulling the servings together. Who would have thought that in the main financial district in Singapore you can have a real Chinese lunch or dinner and not some expensive tripe that business restaurants offer
3
Food was average, peking duck wasn't as tasty as those served in other Chinese restaurants like Crystal Jade. What was more worrying was the level of hygiene here, my friend's tea cup had a lipstick stain and when we informed one of the waitresses she laughed and said "some people put on lipstick which is too red". It wasn't funny or pleasant to hear about this joke, and no offer to change the cup was made
4
In my opinion, the ImpTreas Peking ducks are the best in Singapore. A meal at the original location at Paragon is somehow more satisfying, not so much in terms of the food - which is similar in quality- but the d√©cor is warmer and service much more personable
5
The best peking duck we ever tasted. The skin was so crispy. The meat was tender and soft. We had the claypot brinjal which is soft and flavourful. The balance of the Peking duck meat was fried with noodle - we love it!The prices at this restaurant is quite pricey but if you want good food, then you shouldn't miss out on this restaurant
4
Really great Dining - one of the best imperial ducks. Atmosphere and Furniture is cold, nothing Special surely not cosy. Staff professional

Came for dim sum rather than Peking Duck. Menu included usual prawn dumpling, siu mai and char siew buns, steamed bean curd rolls, and steamed rice rolls and others, and there was also the baked and deep fried variety. Excellent quality and taste for most of what we ordered. We particularly liked the steamed beancurd rolls, the steam rice rolls, and lotus leaf glutinous rice. The egg tarts has very good filling whilst the pan fried water chestnut "cake" was really nice (the latter is not often offered in other dimsum restaurants). The price was not higher than other similar type restaurants.The service was very good. We were there before it got really full, and it was a weekday. We managed to get a table without booking for lunch time, but please book, as we tried to "walk in" for dinner once on a weekend, and it was fully booked
5
As others have stated, the dim-sum and Peking Duck are outstanding. We tried a variety of dishes including carrot cakes, dumplings, and a variety of fish and meat.It's very busy, but you don't have to wait long to be served
5
Imperial Treasure is always my regular Chinese Restauarnt, both for business and family. It is not just because of the quality of food but also service. Thanks to the restaurant manager - Erica and her staff Helen, Miss Teo and Sandra.My favorite dish is definitely the Peking Duck which I consider best in Asia. Tip: Put 2 pcs of duck with the spring onion and the special duck sauce and wrap with the "flour skin". Super!
4
The restaurant is very famous for her Peking Duck. It was good but I personally preferred the Peking Duck served by The Peking Restaurant in Hong Kong Star House. The latter is with slightly more fat while Imperial Treasure had hardly any fat on it. The latter is also with slightly more juicy and slightly more tasteful. However, I liked 2 of their dishes that I had tried this time in Imperial Treasure. Firstly, it was the Bitter Gourd fried with Pork Neck. The taste was excellent and with excellent ' Wok Hei '. The second dish was congee with crispy rice - a modified dish to the old northern China cooking using overnight burnt rice that was dried under sun for days.
5
My family comes here almost every weekend to avoid the weekday lunch crowd. Apart from the crispy Peking Duck this is as authentic as you can get in Cantonese cuisine. Quality cooking with good ingredients. Very very light MSG that I can react to. Dim sum choices are limited but they are very well made.
4
Came here for lunch today, having pre-ordered a duck between 3 of us. Service was very efficient and the duck arrived quite quickly. Decent quality without too much fat. Not particularly cheap at $170 all in including a side dish, tea, extra pancakes and cooking up the duck bones. But still one of the better choices for Peking Duck in Singapore
5
Was really amazed at the consistency of the standard of the peking duck. Had it three times and all three tasted amazing, with the necessary crispy skin and tender tasty meat. Can't go wrong recommending this place for business or gatherings
3
I was here for a business lunch, everything just felt rushed with the food all arriving before you have finished. The food was good but not fantastic, the service was good. If doing a lunch pre-order and get them to slow down. Not sure if I will be back to this one
5
Had lunch at the restaurant and the food and service was impeccable! The Peking duck is really fantastic, very authentic. Worth visiting.
5
It's a great place to eat. Enjoy the ambience. We come here regularly to eat. The Peking duck is very nice.
5
We are familiar with Imperial Treasure in Orchard Road. A friend told me about this branch which was close to our hotel. I made a reservation by email before I left for our trip. We ended up eating here twice, for dinner and lunch the following day.Good Peking Duck. We had a dumpling soup which we thought would be like Xiao Long Bao. It turned out to be a broth with a big dumpling but it was delicious. We had carrot cake with XO. We thought this was a dessert but it was cubes of yumminess, neither tasting strongly of carrot or XO.On my next trip to Singapore, we will be back
5
Order the Peking duck in advance, balance it out with a side of honey BBQ pork and you are onto a winner. Enjoyed every bite
4
I loved coming here for lunches especially sitting at one of the benches. Though it can be a bit cold at times as the air conditioning around the benches area tended to b stronger but it's private, quiet and very nice for business talks. Service is extremely good if you know the crew onboard. Led by Erica the manager, the staff are knowledgeable, service oriented and very very good with customers especially the regulars.Food here is great in particular the Peking duck; and dim sum is pretty good too. I love the carrot cake in XO sauce and the Chee Cheong Fun with you tiao and shrimp. I think they serve one of the best here. Also great are the 'fruit fish' and chicken breast covered in grounded ginger and the rice soup with seafood. I have had dinner here too and each time, me and friends were never disappointed.
5
One of the best Peking roast duck in Singapore. Nicely done with crispy skin. Minimal fat which makes this a healthy choice. $88 per duck sufficient for 4-5 pax if ordered with other dishes. Although it is not necessary to order a day in advanced, may be a good idea to call ahead if you are entertaining guests. Their wasabi prawns is also recommended. Attentive service staff however the restaurant is usually very crowded weekday lunch time
5
Around the world searching for the best Peking duck (Beijing, Shanghai, New York, San Francisco,Malaysia, Australia) and this is by far the best restaurant I've tasted and named it right "super " cos it was what we tasted and enjoyed. We did not 1 day advance order for P.Duck as suggested by the menu.We told receptionist that we really came for the duck and told us to come back after an hour since we did not advance order it. (Or was it that day most Chinese ( about 50,000 people) went to see the festival of the rooster lighting in Chinatown.Bar up on the front and two private rooms along three table booths (choose the booth if you are 2-4 person) then another open space with groups of tables.Table settings tidbits, sugar coated walnuts with sesame seedsChef brought duck, hot and steaming.He cut 4 small sq pieces of crisp skin for us to dipped into the sugar bowl already on the table.Then came the breast meat, steaming moist meat with crispy skin done to perfection. that came with the usual scallions /cucumber /hoisen sauce. Hot thin rice pancake rolls in steam basket.You can order the duck in different ways ( soup, stir fry with veggies or noodles) But we kept out just plain cut up came another round from the whole duck.Tofu with stir fry veggies is great to order. One Peking duck is too much for two people.Great service as well and attentive staffs that looked out if we needed anything
1
The Restaurant look very good frim outside giving the sensation of a fine Chinese Cusine....We request e pan fried Cod fish the come e deep fried Cod fish deep in derty oil..We ask for crab confit and come crab jelly..Then we decide to go for vegetables but the was more garlic then veges ...we ask for truffle nudles at28$ come a watering dish with no test ecxpet for a water truffle test i could not eat at all..My worst Dinner and an insult to the table.Very expansive and not value ...Service as usual attentative but i just wanted good food and i didnt get..
5
Great peking duck with crispy skin and meat. I also ordered spinach with 3 eggs and a daily soup (herbal seaweed). The food was tasty. Attentive service staff - Maggie was very helpful and friendly. I came during dinner time on a weekday, so it wasn't crowded
4
We had good Cantonese food in this restaurant and the service was good. The best thing is that each dish you can order small,medium or large in quantity so its ideal for 2 people wishing to sample more dishes. Unfortunately our entree of stuffed crab shell did not arrive until we have finished our meal. overall its not a bad dining experience
1
Super Peking Duck ...you would at least imagine to have the chance to get it there ,,,,NO ???wrong ...we came there on December 28th ...asking for a table and were told by an rather unfriendly lady that they are fully booked and only could have a table at 13,45 ...we accepted as the restaurant showed its Trip Adviser award winning label and we thought that in that case it MUST be good :...Coming back at 1.45 pm we were again received by an other unfriendly lady ...it looks that whole service and friendly behavior are not necessary ....We ordered Peking duck as we came for that dish and were informed that now they were running out of it !!!???So we ordered dim sums and other stuff ..mainly sweet sour pork ...Whole food and service were extremely poor and we decided to do the best out of it ....Staff continued to be very low professional , food average or poor ...prices high ..too expensive ....Sure that we will not get back there !!!
5
The food portion is alot and the peking duck was great. The service from the staff is fantastic. The price is reasonable.
5
I dine there quite regularly as they offer, in my opinion, some of the best Cantonese dishes in town. Their signature Peking duck, wasabi prawns, salt-baked chicken and three-egg spinach are not to be missed.
5
Had an excellent and consistent experience again on the weekend which is usually less crowded. Kudos to Tommy Tan who is always cheerful and helpful with recommendations for new dished!
5
Traditional duck was well prepared including serving of the 'seconds'. Quick service, once we got seated...

Okay. To be fair Peking Duck is one of my most favorite dishes. I simply love Peking Duck. With that said, I am also and obviously quite picky with the quality of the duck and subsequently the steamed pancake wrapper. Oh yes, not forgetting the sweet bean sauce too!Upon arriving at the entrance of the restaurant, you just know you are going to be in a for treat. Or at least you expecting it. After all, it isn't just Peking Duck. They are confident enough, brave enough, daring enough to call themselves SUPER Peking Duck.And let me say they did not disappoint!We had ordered quite a few dishes, aside from the Peking Duck. This place also served dim sum for lunch ( I am sorry I don't think serve dim sum for dinner though). The dim sum I will say was otherwise good, as one would expect of the restaurant such as this (Ambience/deco/reputation).I will add that among all the dim sum I had eaten there, the chicken feet was one of the best ever. The only other place that served such fantastic flavored braised chicken feet dim sum was in one famous restaurant in Ipoh, Malaysia. When I come back here, I will most definitely order this dish again.Now comes the duck. Like most specialized Peking Duck restaurants, the finished roasted duck will be presented to you for a visual inspection. This is the part where the diners will see if the duck is properly roasted, fat enough and a simple nod of approval will send their service staff to begin slicing the skin and fat of the duck.The duck is presented in to forms. One with the fatty parts and the other just the skin I think. I ate both. And I can tell you, the sauce, the steamed pancake wrapper was just perfect!The taste was not too salty but yet full of flavor. Needless the say the sweet sauce and the cucumber was a perfect blend. I think I can safely say I ate my fair share of duck that day. None was left behind, we had to order another duck for that matter!All in all, I would say this is by far one of the best Peking Duck's I have eaten and that my overall dining experience was Excellent! They do live up to their name: Super Peking Duck
4
The name is the game but also tried a lot of other very excellent and chinese authtentic dishes inclduing prok belly but alos some stunning steamed sweet dumplings filled iwth poppy seed and simmered in a ginger broth for dessert!. Great place to discover chinese cuisine and very crowded and loud
5
Great place! I've tried a lot of Peking Duck in my life and this is one of the best outside of Beijing -- surprisingly the best I ever had outside of China was in India, but that's another review. You don't go for the ambience (which is fine) or view, you go for the duck! Give it a go if you like Peking Duck!
4
The duck skin was well rendered, crispy and the meat delicious. Wrappers were very good and the scallions and cucumber sliced perfectly (nice and thin, I can't stand it when these are cut chunky style). Hoisin tasted a bit to commercial, we prefer one where the restaurant has tweaked it.We were able to byo wine for $30 corkage, which was a good thing.The frustrating part of this restaurant was the noisy loud families that have no regard for other diners. Their 2 yr old had the high chair laid out on the floor sideways and was pretending it was a bus and her sibling climbing in and out and shrieking and pushing it around. Parents oblivious and staff couldn't care less. So it wasn't relaxing and it was very distracting. To be fair badly behaved and unsupervised children seemed to be the norm in Singapore restaurants, hotels etc
4
We patronised the famed Peking Duck restaurant after much persuasion. Other than the awesome duck to savour, the rest of the menu aren't that magnificent for the high price to pay. Staff weren't too attentive either, and didn't bother to tell us they run out of dessert after order was placed.
4
OMG the Peking duck was absolutely to die for. We had the entire duck the first was peking duck and the remainder of the duck was whipped into gorgeous fried rice. A must visit in Singapore if you love duc
4
We came here on a business dinner treat given by new colleagues. Convenient location in the CBD area. Ordered the Peking duck and was not disappointed. Good ambience and food quality!
5
We went for dinner and had the best Peking duck ever! I can only recommend this place to anyone who likes duck and Chinese food! Excellent!
5
Probably the best Peking Duck I have had in Singapore. Very nice restaurant with good service and very tasty items on the menu---would recommend highly
4
Visited said establishment last week, pretty much everything was very good - from the decor to the service to thee food. I ordered the Peking duck, family is vegetarian so ordered assorted dim sums & noodles for them. Since I was the only non vegetarian, Peking duck was too much for 1 person but after reading the reviews I ordered it anyway & was not disappointed. Very juicy, flavourful duck not gamey, and excellent crispy skin made this duck the best I have experienced. Family enjoyed their food as well, particularly the mushroom dimsum. This restaurant also has a big menu for vegetarians. Service was attentive inspite it being lunch rush hour.I will Definately visit again on my next trip to singapore.Disclaimer: have not eaten the Peking duck in china
4
I totally enjoyed my meal here with friends - despite the typical "Chinese" service (let's say you have to know what to expect). The food was amazing, the peking duck simply divine and the other dishes all a triumph. You can generally tell the standard of Asian restaurants by the clientele, this was full of Chinese, definitely a good sign
4
Enjoyed the Dim Sum today especially the Salted Egg yolk custard buns and fried carrot cake with XO sauce . Felt as though we had not enough to of the Salted Egg Custard Bund until we had to 'Ta Bao' √Ø¬ºÀÜmeaning to take away) more of it.. Just Yummy Worth to try the Hong Kong Dumplings.Not sure of the name of this exact dish as my friend was the expert in placing the food order.. You got to emphasise it's the Hong Kong Dumpling and you only get it during this Dumpling Festival period..Found the century egg pork porridge rather diluted . Overall a satisfying lunch today . Thanks to Maggie who took care of our table .Looking forward to going back again in August for our next Ladies Gathering
4
Reservation of table and advance order of peking duck needed to avoid disappointment. Nearest MRT (Downtown Line) will be Downtown Station.It was a dim sum lunch with 1 peking duck for 4 persons. Restaurant located at the business district, there were many working class there. Nice cosy ambience. Few trays of dim sum were fresh and tasty. The peking duck was very good too. Everything went well with jasmine tea.
4
Met with 2 colleagues from Singapore on a recent trip and they'd booked this restaurant for lunch. My first time.A wonderful setting - we didn't have a private dining room but they managed to find a very quiet table for 3. We ordered a number of share plates including wonderful dim sum and possibly the best Peking Duck I've ever had. Very efficient service and prompt.Only reason they didn't score maximum is it took more than 20min to finally get our bill...

@TheKuoKnowsAll you can do is to call it as you see it. And from the many return visits that I have made to Imperial Treasure Super Peking Duck, I consider the restaurant to be somewhere between superb and excellent.The Peking Duck cannot be faulted. It certainly beats anything that I have sampled anywhere, and particularly in Beijing. Imperial Treasure's duck is moist and not at all greasy, which is the downfall of many a wannabe establishments that purports to serve the iconic duck dish.Ask for the duck to be chopped after the skin has been removed. When served as a second dish, it helps cut cost and cut wastage, which is never a bad thing.The restaurant is adept at steaming fish. Soon Hock, which comes in a wide range of sizes, is ideal. The fish can taste better than some of the more expensive exotic varieties on offer.Steamed vegetables are a must. The Hong Kong Kai Lan stir fried with Ginger Juice makes a refreshing change to the more traditional oyster sauce.Imperial Treasure Super Peking Duck is a vey aptly named. The duck is dazzlingly good. But man cannot live by duck alone. So it is a good job the restaurant is also super at other dishes too

My husband and I visited here with our Son who lives in SG and he had recommended the Peking Duck. The duck was delicious and certainly one of the best we have tasted the service unfortunately was disappointing, our wine waiter was really good and the lovely wee lady waitress who attended our table was an absolute delight. However, the surly man with the Mohican style haircut, who I assume was Head Waiter, was downright rude. When we arrived we were given the a la carte menu and a dim sum menu, we had preordered the duck but were going to choose some dim sum to accompany this, the head waiter literally snatched the dim sum menu from us saying "no dim sum" and walked away. When we chose a bottle of wine he said, quite bluntly, that it was no longer available we had to ask if there was a suitable alternative and he turned and walked away without a word. The wine waiter came over and quickly and efficiently resolved the issue. During our meal, Mr Rude came over and topped up my Son's wine, topped up mine dripping wine down the side of my glass and onto the tablecloth then sat the bottle on the table completely ignoring my husband's near empty glass. Our visit to Imperial Treasure was a very unpleasant experience all because of this horrible man, I certainly won't be back and would recommend that anyone considering booking a table look elsewhere, there are so many lovely places to eat in SG that this rude service doesn't have to be tolerated
5
The best peking duck ever and the service is very good.
We will definitely be back to try out some other dishes.
4
The Peking Duck is amazing. Pricey, but worth it. The service is not. Staff can't be blamed as they are running to keep the guests satisfied.We had the crab in aspic. Tasty, but not worth the money. The pork belly was delicious and the wines were not that crazy priced.Nice for a casual dinner with friends and family. But if you have a business dinner or want to impress I'm afraid the service will be problematic
4
If you are looking for Peking roasted duck or Hongkong BBQ Char Siew, this is one of the top choices. If you are looking for dim sum, the level here is average or a bit above. Of course, it's not bad, it's good, but not a Wow place. Reasonably priced, good service and environment, suitable for family gathering. Good.
4
This is one of the best Peking Duck that I have eaten. Better than the famous places in China. The skin is crispy and the duck meat is succulent and juicy. Must try. May be a bit expensive but worth getting fat over it. Must make reservation
1
Had this CNY dinner with my inlaws and family. Took so time to finalise the restaurant to go and finally decided on this. What a mistake. The manager who took our orders don't really pay attention and floating her eyes around when we place our orders. She keep mentioning "enough right" a few times when we order our fifth dishes onwards. It's weird that she is limiting our ordering numbers. In the end, there were missed ordered dishes. I can see she is paying attention to a table which I think is her regulars. A table which is infested with more than 3 people to served. So if you guys must go please be a regular before otherwise your money is no good to the
5
This was the best peking duck we had in Asia. Of course, the atmosphere was a bit upscale due to its location in the Paragon. Everything about the way they do duck will make you scream in joy. The roasted duck skin was perfectly crisp and meat was sweet and juicy. We also devoured their shrimp dish in particular. In East Asia (China, Hong Kong, Singapore) seafood is cooked with much more precision than in Europe, you can't go wrong with it. We look forward to come back soon again
5
If you're a duck lover and visiting Singapore, you're in for a treat! The best roasted duck ever to tease your palate. The skin is so delicate and roasted to crisp without any trace of fats. The meat is moist, juicy and soft wrap in thin pancake. The rest of the meat can either be fried with rice or noodles.Make this the centrepiece of your meal and you can have dim sum to give variety. You will not be disappointed.However, do make reservations as it is fully booked even on weekdays

My partner and I was there to celebrate a friend's birthday on the 16th January Evening. The booking was made with 50 people and we were arranged to be in a private room setting. It was beautifully set up and the service was fantastic. Servers were proactive in topping up our drinks and food service was just so prompt and unobtrusive. I love it. Although the place was a little cramped, most of us were happy to mingle around. Food was good but not fantastic, dishes can be a hit or miss. Go with the signatures like Peking Duck, it's a safe choice. Lastly, we stayed till late, past 11pm, and i am surprised to see that the service was still professional till the time we left. We didn't felt like they were chasing us out even though it is already so late. The place and people is definitely one of the reasons for visiting this place again
3
Very good peking duck but unfortunately (realized too late to ask them to do differently) only 4 pieces of crispy skin served before the most of the remaining part of the duck is cut with skin and meat together - still good but misses whole idea of peking duck with crispy skin..
5
I am a big fan of Peking duck and tried it in many places in Singapore and Beijing, this place has the best peking duck. Service is a hit or miss; often times it has been super fast and other times they just missed an order. Must have the wasabi prawns
5
The name says it all- the duck was an imperial super treasure! Super crispy skin, succulent moist meat, cooked perfectly. Service was wonderful. The fried rice was also really delicious (my nephew's favorite)
The best part is still the name though, I mean seriously
4
Don't forget to order your Peking Duck in advance! It was in fact as Super as the name of the restaurant boasts.
5
Been twice to their restaurant at paragon and on our second visit, it was really a great one. We were in such a hurry cause some of my family members are rushing to catch flight. The staffs were all very attentive and understood our situation that we need all food to come out fast, including the Peking duck!!..really appreciate their great service and their food is great as always.. Will definitely come again for their Peking duck!:
4
One of our extended family members treated my family to this branch in Paragon for dinner on Thursday night (X'Mas Eve). We had a lot of dishes. Sharks' fin, fish, shrimps, beef and noodles which were all so well cooked. We also had their house Signature Dish the Peking Duck, which by far will have to be the best we have tried throughout all the restaurants in Singapore. Its skin so tender and crispy, the oil is just right. Actually when we finished the duck, we wanted another half duck, but were told by the waitress that we could only order one whole duck, and not half. Unfortunately, the restaurant sold out of ducks. The dessert was good too, not too sweet. Shou tao was being served too, as the next day was gonna be my mom's birthday. It was just made right, not too sweet. The atmosphere of the restaurant is definitely cosy, and we had to share the room with other people too, and was crowded, but we still managed to hear each other's conversation in the room, so it was good. My mom commented that likely that our family of 3 will visit this restaurant in the near future, though must order one whole Peking duck. However, one duck after being sliced into pieces, also did not seem a lot, so still worth it
5
Great value Peking Duck, set in a surprisingly upmarket setting at the top of Paragon Mall. It is definitely set as more upmarket than the prices suggest. I also suggest trying the Suckling Pig. And at only about $24 per shot, throw down a Johnnie Walker Blue as an aperitif.
4
We took a group of Chinese colleagues from Beijing for the ultimate challenge - would the Peking Duck be as good as the "real thing". It was. The duck was superbly carved, the skin was crispy and the meat moist. The only observation from our colleagues was that it was served cooler than they were used to. The rest of the meal was very good as well, succulent fish, lovely vegetables and excellent rice and noodles.Well worth a visi
4
My friends and I was there for the dimsum. It was very delicious. Service was good. The environment of the restaurant was cosy. In Singapore, it is always advisable to make booking before hand, because the restaurant can be very crowded during busy hours, especially on the weekend
5
We had dinner at the restaurant on a Thursday night to celebrate a birthday and the entire family was thoroughly impressed with the service and the food quality. To summarise the pros and cons here below...Pros: Awesome service! The lady, I do believe her name is Patricia Chan, who was attending to our table had been the most thoughtful through the evening. Just to name one instance, we probably over ordered for dinner and she was really thoughtful to help us reduce the size of the last dish (noodles fried with the peking duck) without our request and that really helped us avoid an episode of over-eating. Furthermore, when it was time for the birthday cake, the restaurant even prepared the candles for us and lighted them before bringing it to the table while most restaurants would not have offered this special service. Overall the experience has been very pleasant and the food is of top-notch quality as expected. Cons:Perhaps due to the fact that it had been a weekday, there were many tables entertaining guests / holding post-work dinner parties. It did get a little rowdy at the table beside us with profanities spewed across the table (though that is totally beyond the control of the restaurant). The echos can get a little loud in the area. In addition, make sure you do make a booking before heading down. While waiting to be seated, we overheard a party of 3 being rejected at the doors simply because the restaurant was fully booked. Do make sure you order your peking duck ahead of time as well so you do not miss the main attraction
5
Imperial Treasure Super Peking Duck Restaurant, SingaporeFamed for roasting the Peking duck to perfection, Imperial Treasure Super Peking Duck is a traditional Chinese restaurant run by chef Tong Yuk Sing and his team from Beijing.The authentic restaurant serves the famous dish in line with centuries-old methods taken from the Emperor‚Äôs imperial kitchen, in which each duck is roasted to perfection before being sliced on the platter before diners‚Äô eyes. Good service and great ambiance. It as also a good menu apart from the duck. Well worth a visi
3
I read the huge menu over and over, trying to find any mention of Peking duck, and I failed. When the waitress came to take my order I asked if they did Peking duck, and she said it was a whole duck. I was eating on my own, so I just ordered some roast pork as a starter, and chicken with mushrooms as a main, but neither did much for me. Everyone else around me seemed to be enjoying the Peking duck. What a pity I missed out. I was never given a wine list, so just had a couple of beers
5
Had lunch at the Paragon branch recently with colleagues. Duck as naturally very good.. and the dim sum quality is awesome. Will definitely return.
3
Average place with average food and average services..I would recommend the other outlet at paragon shopping centre.
5
Fantastic Peking duck at a great price. So tasty. Booked at the last minute and were lucky to secure table. Was a little tricky to find but worth it.

This restaurant specializes in Peking duck - glazed shiny red and succulent. Served traditionally with pancakes and dressings. Some of the whole duck can be re-served as a rice dish but you don't get the other half of your duck, only small dice inside the rice dish. Scallops are S$20 each! Pricey and not soooo delicious. They have a spectacular wine list and chilled wine room. Huge prices. Maybe you'd like a 1999 2nd growth Bordeaux? Dig very deep and you can..

All their dishes are great, but their duck is absolutely amazing. You can't go to this restaurant and not order a whole duck. They bring out the roasted duck and cut it right in front of you. The skin is so crispy, the meat is so tender and flavorful, you almost want to order a whole duck just for yourself. Even the plates have ducks -- very adorable! Besides duck dishes, I highly recommend their tofu, spinach, and mushroom dish -- it's just a beautifully integrated dish with so much flavor and texture, even if you're not a tofu fan, you should still try it and be converted.

As the name suggest this place is excellent in making Peking duck. Typically it is meant for 4 people.The duck skin is very fragrant and tasty. The Chinese thin pancakes perfectly moist and fresh. All the small condiments match the flavors. It is a great meal.The left over meat would be good in a fried rice.In the past we could order lettuce wrap or salted duck vegetable soup...but not available anymore.The dim sum here is also very good

Well first of all the peking duck was great. There is nothing to say and 1 duck is more then enough for 2 people that you do not needs to order anything else.Any frankly you should not, the rest of the food ranges from average to bad (scallops with truffle oil.... just do not do it).As for the atmosphere, very dark, very crowded and loud. You have an impression of being food court and you d not feel like staying after you ate...If you want a good quality duck but a good atmosphere as well I would look at other options like Paradise Pavillion for example

Was very impressed with the Peking Duck here, and also the fact that the duck was of a good weight, so there was more than enough duck to go around.Having last eaten this dish in china where I was bitterly disapointed with the lack of any actual meat I was much happier here.Service was fine, nothing extraordinary but warm enough.They packed up the extra duck to take back with us and overall I can't fault the place , sadly location, inside a mall makes the atmosphere a little bit tepid
5
I had tried few Peking duck in Singapore , this restaurant serve the best one! Super crispy skin with the meat tender and juicy, most importantly, less fat too :) I went there for dim sum most of the time, its really good and that makes me go back again and again
3
Located in the financial hub, this is a decent enough restaurant to bring guests for a business meal. For family meals on weekends, this is definitely less crowded than their other outlet in Paragon. Their signature Peking duck is not the best I have had and pale in comparison with some of the other dishes are more interesting and tasty
5
The restaurant was packed, great atmosphere. The duck pancakes were excellent.
You have to order a whole duck and there was only two of us so we also got the left over duck with noodles, also delicious.
1
The food is consistently good as per normal Imperial Treasure restaurants, BUT the service is TERRIBLE. I won't pay for such unfriendly and terrible service. Avoid if possible
4
Must reserve as lunch is always full. Love the dim sum and A la carte of soup and Peking duck are tasty.
5
Make sure you book in advance and pre-order the Bejing duck ( Peking duck with pancakes) as it lives up to its "super" reputation. The skin of as perfectly crispy and the meat succulent and juicy and not at all tough. We found the duck and a side of vegetables was more than enough for 2 for lunch. Will be back again to try more of the very inviting men

We went there for a birthday celebration due to a recommendation from a relative. We had the peking duck and it was the first time I saw the chef preparing and slicing the skin in front of me! The taste was great and one of the best peking duck i have tried. Our party of 10 all liked it as well. The decorations were extensive and made the ambience very warm and lovely. Service was also amazing, we were served by an elderly lady in her late forties and she did make sure we were happy. Overall a very good experience! Highly recommended for celebrations

We orders peking ducks 3 days in advance and was warned to come out time because our reservation was only 11am - 12.30. We came 11am sharp. Food was great. Except peking duck came at 12.15. They push the bills to be paid by 12.20. We informed them that we need some time to eat the peking duck.Meanwhile, they keep taking our plates. Even sometimes the one we haven't finished eating!At 12.25 We decided to pay the bill first while we rushed eating.At 12.27, another person came to us, saying that we have to leave, because the next reservation has already arrived. At that time, I was very angry. I told them that we haven't finished chewing the duck! It wasn't fair that the peking duck came out late due to congestion in the kitchen, meanwhile they kicking us out regardless.I think this is very rude behavior and unacceptable in such a fine restaurants !They need to be able to coordinate internally better! And be responsible if they screwed up! Don't let customers becomes a victim
5
A whole Peking duck comes to the table, glistening gold skin, cooked to perfection, the chef carves the crispy skin off the outside & then you role your own Peking duck crepes with hoisin sauce, cucumber & spring onion, delicious.They take the duck back to the kitchen & use the rest of the duck in any dish of your choosing..This is now my 7 year olds favorite food & the best I have ever eate

I have only been to this Imperial Treasures once before at lunch and whilst the Peking Duck was good, the contrast with the dim sum was all wrong and the whole meal was a little too heavy for lunch. [Aside: There are now quite a few good Peking Duck places in Singapore such as Paradise Pavilion, Tung Lok Peking Duck, Hua Ting etc But as a group they are not quite as good as those in Hong Kong due, I suspect, to the duck. A good Peking duck dish essentially requires three good ingredients: a 65 day old duck with just the right amount of fat below the skin; steamed pancakes with the right elasticity; and an aromatic sweet sour hoisin sauce made within the last 24 hours to provide the ‚Äòearth‚Äô taste. Traditionally the Emperor‚Äôs used a black feathered Nanjing duck that ranged free (muscle buildup) then force feed for 20 days (fat buildup). I can understand why having eaten such a duck in Nanjing.]This time around we decided to forgo the duck and dim sum and went instead for the √† la carte. The triple opening dish of char siu, roast pork and oiled chicken proved a fab appetizer. The char siu melted, the crackling complimented the butter pork beautifully (all the Imperial Treasures seem to do this very well) and the chicken slithering down with no problems at all. The fish maw and mushroom soup was classically Cantonese all texture on a very subtle background of clear soup. Good but I still prefer the double boiled version with chicken and ginseng much to the disgust of my more conservative Cantonese aunts. The claypot fish was OK, in fact so OK I had to struggle to remember it. Then came the lobster and truffle oil noodles. Now I admit I grimaced. White truffle oil, I sighed (my aunt order that dish), one of the more over rated ingredients in a pantry. Boy was I surprised. It grounded the whole dish adding the umami that lobster lacks and as an added bonus a treat for the nose. I asked but the captain was unable to tell me if the kitchen made its own truffle oil from black perigord. But for this dish alone I would come back (I normally prefer the Imperial Treasures at Great World)

Me and my friend we went to the Paragon branch just for Peking duck and we had a fantastic meal here. The Peking duck was perfect. The pork as apetizer war also really well done. The service little bit long but we really enjoyed the meal. I am sure this is the best place for duck in Singapore
4
peking duck there is above average. dessert is great as well espeically the custard bun. must make reservation when you want to visit there. if possible, pls book a room and ask for help Ben(room bear minimum charges S$120 per person). Service for those aunties there also warm and nice
4
The food (especially the Peking Duck) was amazing. The waitstaff made a few errors on the order and seemed more annoyed than apologetic with our request to exchange. Atmospher was good (a bit noisy).
5
Was there with the family, we always ordered their peking duck and have never been disappointed. Every dish was just up to our expectation or even above. I would highly recommend this restaurant if you are a peking duck lover.
5
I think I was in the sister outlet in Paragon. Dim Sum is really good - Peking duck is particularly tasty. Not crazy expensive but well worth a visit. We love it.
5
Best Cantonese cuisine in town. Consistent and high quality food very time. This is the restaurant that we choose to entertain our friends both local and visitors, who have all loved it. Unfailingly, we would order the peking duck which is carved and served table side. This, in my mind, is their best signature dish and is a
5
We took our family from out of town here to try the chinese food. The food was excellent and authentic with very friendly and attentive service. We pre-order the whole duck and comes in two dishes of your choice. Price was very reasonable for this level of food and service. We sat at a booth which made it more private to talk. I would definitely come back again.
5
Peking duck was good but what impressed me most was the peppery crab cooked in a clay pot with bean‚Äêstarch vermicelli. The crab meat was sweet and tender. The prawns stir fried with salt eggs were also exceptionally delicious. These are the two dishes you must order when eat at this restaurant
5
Went to the Paragon branch and had a fantastic meal here. The Peking duck was perfect. The meat succulent and full of flavor. The fresh scallops in XO sauce was nice. The steamed wagyu beef was so tender and very well prepared. The service was great and we really enjoyed the meal. Best place for duck in Singapor
4
We ordered the Peking duck and it was amazing. Note that you have to preorder the duck - the website is misleading. The waitstaff were very abrupt. We were 20 minutes late and this may be why they treated us so badly but it made for a mixed experience. Would highly recommend the food but don't be late
4
The super Peking duck is not that super but good quality, skin crispy and meat ok. I recommend the tofu, the noodle and the ginger soup that were very good, dim sum not that bad, after the waiter brought the tofu the manager immediately scold him that the tofu sauce was too liquid and ask him to take it out of the table and remake another one that was great! Waiting was not too long but we saw a big queue when we leave around 1p
4
After a hard week of work, took my colleague and his wife to dinner -- and after he told me he loved Peking Duck I knew where to go! As usual the service was impeccable -- although I will say in this case (not the service faulty I don't think) they had a bunch of things on their menu (which is HUGE!) that they didn't actually have this time around I liked the last time. I also think they did a bit of an upsell on me to some (ok, tasty) crab when I asked for Shrimp. But all in all, the food was all good.I love how they do the duck -- it's so artistic. And my friends said it was the best duck they EVER had -- period. And they've been to China a few times! So it's spend, but worth a special treat every once in a while
3
I visited the Paragon location in the past, and loved it. This time was a bit disappointing. The waitress pushed the food fast, some of it was cold. Felt like this brad expended too much, they even had a fast food stand across the hall
5
delicious fare; make reservations for it is much in demand; great service with good explanation...eat the duck!
4
we went there for lunch and ordered Peking duck with some dim sums. the dishes were quick and high quality, first class service!
5
Excellent Peking duck carved at the table, good service and great ambiance. Well worth a visit with a good menu as well as the duck.
3
One of the best Peking Duck I've had. But the staff are offhand verging on rude. And make sure your bank balance is robust - expensive doesn't adequately describe it!
4
You need to order the duck in advance and reservations seem to be a must.
The duck is absolutely a must, and its crispy and has a wonderful combination of savoury and fullness of flavour.
The durian pudding was not too bad either.
4
We came here for office lunch and ordered the peking duck one day before at $65. The duck didnt disappoint. The skin were very crispy and very well roasted. Portion was enough for the 6 of us to have 4 servings of the duck skin wrap each. The wrap however was slightly small and couldnt really wrap the duck skin and veggie properly and the stuff was falling out. Suggest to use a slightly bigger wrap. The duck sauce was really nice and complimented the wrap well. We had the rest of the duck meat cooked with fried rice and it was also nicely done. We also had dimsums which were all authetic hong kong style. I would definitely come back for more. Even if i have to eat in shifts
5
We were guests and quite impressed to see the Peking duck served in three courses, first just the skin as an amuse bouch√É¬©e with sugar then sliced with both skin and meat with pancakes and later as a noodle dish.The steamed fish which I believe was a giant river fish was also very nice.The prawns served Singapore chili crab sauce style was my favourite, notToo spicy with the "mun tho" buns. Service was immaculate as was the setting. Perfect for a business lunch or otherwise
4
I've eaten here a number of times and will return for reliable good Peking Duck. The Duck is not the best I've had but is amongst the best I've had in Singapore. However the other dishes have all been a disappointment. So much so that I normally only order the Duck and Chinese Tea and have the rest of my meal elsewhere. This visit I had guests and ordered a full meal - it was a mistake. Good Duck, poor to average other courses.
1
My boyfriend and I were recommended this restaurant by some friends. In order to 100% get a table we even made a reservation in order to try their famous peking duck. When we arrived we were nicely greeted and guided to our table. We ordered our drinks and this famous roasted duck beijing style- it took us 30 min to get to the restaurant as it's not right in the city centre so we were already very excited for it.After approx. 10 minutes the waiter approached us to let us know they RAN OUT OF DUCKS! How can a restaurant named after a special dish run out of exactly these dishes?? There were still customers arriving after us who got the duck and we didn't. This experience was quite disappointing for such a high-end restaurant. Never again
4
You want western service, this ain't the place. Great Chinese food you've come to the right place.
Menu has it all, page after page of outstanding Chinese entrees.
Peking duck was incredible, perfectly prepared, carved table side.
5
We were had two tables of 8 and had a wonderful meal and the food was sublime. Nothing like the European style of Peking Duck. The other food chosen by the regulars added to the whole ambience.
Definitely worth a visit for style and flavour.
4
Have to say , the perking duck here is indeed very delicious. Other dishes we order were nice too, but not special enough to justify the high price of the place. Personally, i dont think it offer good value for money.
5
Accompanied by singaporean to try this restaurant. He said it one of the best pecking duck. And its true. I love this place.Try spinach and chicken soup for starter. Crispy skin and soft inside combination with special sauce, sugar and cucumber plus scallion. Very good. And also try mie phok with truffle oil...Tips for you who doesn't speak mandarin and doesn't know you want to order because in the menu lilbit confusing... Just ask to manager and she will give you best recommendations
4
I love imperial treasure super duck. However, there is a reason why the original outlet at Paragon is perpetually full and reservation a necessity.Although they have the same menu, the one at Paragon is much better. Taste-wise, this place definitely falls short. We tried the exact same dishes that we always get there: Peking duck, deep-fried frog legs with ginger, Mee pok with truffle. All were better at the other place.Save your calories, book earlier and go to the outlet at Paragon.
5
It's call super for a good reason. In Singapore you got to be pretty good in order to substain that name. We were given a small private lounge like area with sliding door and the ambience was good. The duck was delivered delicious as promised and we were not disappointed. Do book before coming even on weekdays cos the ducks are in high demand everyday! Cheers..
4
The food is quite scrumptious, but somehow it is marginally less flavourful than the original Imp Treas Super Peking Duck outlet at Paragon. Service is good, but again, less enthusiastic and friendly compared to Paragon. The Peking duck itself is at par with the one at nearby Paradise Pavilion, and not as luscious as Paragon
4
Imperial Treasure is synonymous with fine Chinese cuisine. If I am looking to bring my overseas guests or family out for a Chinese meal, I know the meal will be enjoyable and nobody can fault their food. This restaurant located at Asia Square, diagonally opposite Lau Pa Sat offers Peking Duck as its signature dish. When your signature dish is used in the restaurant's name, you know they have to be at the top of the game. Indeed, the Peking Duck was one of the best I have had.You can also order the dishes from their extensive menu, including roast meats, seafood, vegetables, noodles and rice. End your meal with their 'Liu Sha Bao' which is steamed custard bun. It will be the perfect end to a meal at Imperial Treasure
5
If you want a really good meal at a real bargain price in a nice restaurant you have to go here and have the Peking Duck.During our visit we were the only westerners in the place which we thought was a good sing although the restaurant is located in one of the modern office towers of Singapore. An a good sign it was. The duck was nice, the skin crispy, the staff pleasant and the bill just over SGD 120 for the four of us
5
We love peking duck and we have been patronised a few restaurants in Singapore. Imperial Treasure serves the best peking ducks in Singapore!Our family prefers the one at Marina Bay Sands. The service at Asia Square is not that good. Avoid lunch time because they will chase you to finish the food
4
A local friend brought us to this restaurant, apparently reservation has to be made in advance to avoid disappointment. We ordered the dim sums and their signature Peking duck. Dim Sums tasted really good and the Peking duck was superb. The service was prompt and friendly. We will come back to this restaurant again the next time when we visit Singapore
5
Is it any wonder that I can never get a reservation at any of the branches of Imperial Treasure at the weekends especially at Great World City.I cant even queue because the staff will not put me on the waiting list. But if you have never had dim sum or dinner there or at any of the branches eg Paragon, you are missing out. It is worth a visit on weekdays when one can make a reservation and sample the delicacies.I have never found the staff rude, contrary to some reviews. But I do find them sometimes stressed. In fact the service is great when you go early and not try to have lunch during peak periods, go early order early and have a relaxing enjoyable experience
3
Amazing peking duck and worth going here for the duck, even though the restaurant was almost empty. Had dinner a Sunday night at 8 pm, but usually in the big cities with lots of tourist, it doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t matter what day of the week you go out, restaurants are always crowded. There were no music playing in the restaurant, it was completely silent, and the restaurant closed at 9:30 pm. Don't know if that's normal? It was kind of a weird experience, never tried it before, and the atmosphere was not very inviting. Service was okay and prices very reasonable
3
The Asia Square development is worth a visit in its own right - it has such presence and is a vibrant place with plenty of places to eat and drink. If you choose this restaurant you get tucked away upstairs out of sight and mind, and you could in fact be anywhere. There are much better locations in this development.However that is doing a disservice to the restaurant that does in fact provide a very good meal - well executed Chinese dishes that are served up fast and efficiently by congenial staff. Larger tables have lazy Susan's to help share the food amongst your friends, and generally the atmosphere is upbeat.Worth a visit
5
We went there with friends. We pre-ordered our Peking Duck the day before. We were seated right at our reservation time- 6:30 on a Friday night. It was crowded but the service was great. This was the best Peking Duck that I have ever had. The skin was crispy and the meat very flavorful. The duck is served with scallions and mini crepes and oyster sauce. The restaurant is located on a mall and is a little tricky to find.... But try to find it
4
I was taken there for lunch and dinner (on different days!) and really enjoyed both menus. The dinner menu was a smorgasbord of Chinese delicacies, the best of which was the famous duck skin!! You have to dip it in the sugar provided, it is amazing!! I had dim sum when I went to lunch which is by far the best I have had. No soggy coatings and very well flavoured fillings. I would definitely recommend either. It is in the business district so is slightly lifeless but the food and company more than made up for it
3
I made reservation for today at 1:30pm. We got our table at 1:55pm. Yes I understand it's a Chinese Restaurant but if you serve Champagne and want to be a some sort of fine dinning, you need to fix this issue. Nobody likes to wait.Food quality was fine. Not so outstanding. Service wasnt that great. They kinda screw up the quality of wrap for pecking duck but the manager didnt even apologize. don't get me wrong, the staff seemed to be great! Will I go back? not so soon
4
Had to preorder this dish well ahead. When I saw the duck, it looks really good. The gloss on the skin is really shining which makes the skin crispy with tender flesh. One of the better ducks I have ever tasted. I also had pepper beef which is also good. If you are a duck lover, book this in advance
4
Ordered the Peking Duck by accident really (later). The duck was amazing, the knife skills on the duck breast looked laser cut, it is that even. More than enough pancakes which is always lacking in other Peking duck places. The extra dish that comprised of the leftover duck with noodles looks plain but taste amazing. We were already quite full and thought we may just have a small serve of the noodles, well, we cleaned the plate.Ok, the service, we were a little confused with the menu being quite extensive. So we asked if there is Peking duck for two, the waitress said she will check whether there is one available (we need to order a whole duck) but instead the duck is ordered without confirmation. Then she and other waitress kept moving our bowls and cutlery around for no reason (huh???). The extra dish with noodles was not explained to us until we ask if the duck set has anything else. Nevertheless we are happy with the 'accident'. By the way no language barrier here, I speak Mandarin quite fluently
3
Decent duck at reasonable prices. Some of the other dishes are, however, fairly overpriced without being exceptional. The whole fish was quite expensive but really wasn't that great, and the chicken and sea snail soup also not fantastic. I will come back here again but will focus on the duck without the additional items
4
First time visiting this restaurant. Atmosphere is very upscale, with a sense of elegance. Well maintained amenities.
The Peking duck was served promptly, expertly cut and presented well. Excellent taste.
Staff was professional and friendly. Would highly recommend this venue.
5
The best duck I have ever tasted to date. Chef carves duck with precision. The 1st skinning prepares your taste buds for whats to come. Skin melts in your mouth. Meat is juicy and tender. Yummy for the tummy.
5
Superb and well-priced. Recommended to us by a local, the duck was superb, and we ordered far more food than we could eat. Highly recommended.
4
It has a good review so we tried it. We were not disappointed. Good atmosphere, good food but pricey. Peking duck was very good, kids were welcome too. Location is good as it is in a all along orchard road
5
This is the second best peking duck I have ever had (and I have consumed many, many peking ducks..... ). A couple of tips:1. Pre order the duck the day before your booking to be safe2. Not all staff speak English so make sure your hotel pre-orders for you if possible3. With the rest of the duck order the San Choi Bao, simply outstanding, the best I have ever eaten (and you get the drift, I have eaten a lot in my time....) Pros - this really is great value in a very pleasant setting. The duck is served four ways - skin only, breast with skin, and other bits with skin. The remainder of the duck meat is served either as fried rice or san choi bao. Suprisingly even though this is quadruple duck, it creates enough interest and difference in taste to really keep the taste buds interested. The skin is crispy, the duck is light and has little fat (due to the particular duck they use, I am told).The restaurant would get 4.5 stars however tripadvisor does not allow this. I have marked them up for the two free desserts we received (Durian and mango pudding). Definitely worth a try if you are in pursuit of the best peking duck (who isn't?). I am hungry just thinking about this meal
4
Went for the first time with colleagues during lunch time. The atmosphere is nice but nothing to fancy. We tried the Peking duck and I can tell, it's one of the best I've tried in Singapore. Service was good and price ok.Will definitely go back
5
My family and I enjoys Peking duck and have tried Peking duck from various local authentic resturants. This one wow us the most. the meat was flavorful and tender. The chef took the effort to slice out pieces in 3 ways. 1) duck skin without any meat. For a table of four, he really just give us four pieces 2) duck skin coupled with meat for us to wrap with the duck wrap and cucumbers etc3) a decent portion of duck breast meat The remaining was cooked with noodles at our option. will recommend giving this price a try. The whole roasted duck isn't too expensive as it is only priced at $78SGD. *order in advance in case the Peking ducks run out of order. Reservations are recommended.
3
The Peking duck should be pre-ordered otherwise there's no guarantee you can get it. It was lean and not oily but the skin wasn't crisp. For tim sum we ordered the regular items: har kow, siew mai, char siew bao and char siew shou, chee cheong fun. We felt it was also overrated. From my memory, Royal China at Raffles food is much better. Bad points:1. It's hard to find from the underground car park because it faces the roadside. You need to walk all the way around to behind the lift to locate the restaurant and there are no directional signs to follow.2. Crying babies on the day I was there made it rather noisy.Good points: 1. Considering I made a booking on Sunday morning for lunch the same day, it's probably one of the few better known Chinese restaurants that it's possible to get a last minute seating at a decent time.2. The tables are well spaced out so that it seems popular for families especially those with younger kids as 1 saw at least 4 strollers there when I visited
4
A great restaurant to enjoy Peking Duck. The service was also very good. The cook bring the duck and cuts it, and the waitress actually folds the duck and vegetables in the pancake for you. I also loved the plate in form of the duck, where duck was served. The location is also pretty good, it is nice to enjoy a walk around Marina Bay
5
It's difficult to say how good was the Pecking Duck as I never had it before, but definitely it was perfect in terms of cooking time, was very yummy!!!The staff has helped us with suggestion on how to eat it, I mean with the right souce and so on.Once again the best Duck I had, it was my first ;-) and definitely one of the best service we had in Singapore!!
5
I thoroughly enjoyed Peking Duck, expertly prepared and served.
One of the best Chinese meals I have had in Singapore. Location in a busy shopping mall has its inconveniences.
5
If you like your Peking duck I highly recommend this restaurant. Best to order in advance. Service and other food item are also good but can't go past the duck.
5
Wonderful duck, beef in black pepper unbelievably tender and delicious, attentive service - definitely to be recommended
4
I usually have to work on a public holiday, and so as a treat, I usually take myself to a decent restaurant for lunch. Imperial Treasure at Asia Square serves some really excellent dim sum. Unfortunately it is quite expensive but as long as the quality is good, I don't mind paying!It is located on the same floor as the Food Garden (a low cost food court) but it bears no resemblance those outlets. This is a luxurious restaurant with excellent service. Bear in mind bookings for Friday (when most Singaporeans splurge a bit) are essential. Having been here with colleagues for the duck, I can also say that it is another must try.Would I come back? Yes
4
When you enter a deserted 'food garden' your expectation are low but the Imperial Treasure, hidden away in Tower 1 of Asia Square, was a very pleasant surprise. Excellent dishes, great staff but the best lemon prawns you will taste. Worth a visit if staying in that area
5
This is another one of the Imperial Treasure Group outlets that we go to regularly... Always happy with both the food and the excellent service... My favourite place for Peking Duck and also if only for a dim sum lunch... Soups are almost always yummy too
4
This resturant is great, the best part of it is the peking duck. The duck is cut in front of you by the chef, and then placed on plates, you are then served cucomber and spring onion and a selection of sauces. You have your small pancake wrap and you put it all together, the result is actually amazing. The other dishes are good, but I think that sometimes you want something in between the sizes, and the medium hardly has anything while the large has alot. I would complain though about the prices. It is way to expensive and the fish is weighed through 100g!!!!!! I think that it is better to come in the evening and the resutrant is more of a bussiness friendly places whereas I always bring my kids on their birthdays and special occasions
4
This is our favourite for Peking duck in Singapore - in fact, it is among the best in Asia (it beats any version I've had in China). The duck is really luscious, and the pancakes are moist and of the right thickness. Among the different formulae for the second course that we've tried, we like the deep fried duck with salt and pepper (dry) the best. Other dishes are also very good, as is the case with Imperial Treasure eateries. Service is very attentive; after a few times the receptionists recognise you, even when you make a telephone booking. For such high standards, it's very good value. No wonder it's always full (and therefore can be noisy)
5
Ok ok -- I haven't had Peking duck a LOT -- but I have had it almost every trip to Singapore so about 5 times. This is the first time I've tried it here -- but after reading review after review about how good it is, I had to try it and dragged my colleague here for a special meal.Was I glad I did! We both agreed that it was one of the best meals we've had -- period! First, although on the 5th floor of Paragon, once you walk inside you get transported to a different world -- it's very very lovely -- lots of wood overtones, leather, etc. The service is just exemplary -- very attentive yet not too much so. Very very professional!The duck? What can I say -- my mouth is still tingling remembering how crispy and tasty the skin was, and how succulent the meat. We (well, I decided for us) made our own rolls -- so we could control the proportions, etc. and besides, that's half the fun of Peking Duck anyway, right? The chef comes out with our duck on a cart and then performs laser like surgery on it -- like a musician doing a solo. It was awesome to see -- and before you know it, we have duck skin, then duck with a little meat (high end part) and then duck with skin and a bit more juicy meat. So you get 3 types of initial course to make your little pancakes with (or just starting eating the damn thing! ) Then we ordered the rest of the duck with the fried noodles ... which came about 20 minutes later (perfect).But wait, I forgot about the Hot and Sour Soup! It was AWESOME. Maybe the best hot and sour I've had in my life -- certainly top 3! We also ordered the Scallops with Olive and Cashew. Seriously, this was a REVELATION on how good scallops could be. Even after all the duck, we were waxing poetic on the scallops - -this is a must order item IMHO! The flavors melded and the scallops just so perfectly cooked and no overwhelming single flavor note! We were TOTALLY stuffed by the end of the meal -- and easily could have fed 1 or 2 more people for what we ordered... luckily I have leftovers! :) TIP: They have a nice amount of private business rooms that look very nice for a business dinner if you need privacy (and looks like it holds maybe 8-10 people). Also make sure to make reservations -- and reserve your duck! They can run out

This place is known for the marvelous Peking duck. What surprised me on my last visit was the hairy crab promotion that they were having. We had a menu with many dishes made with this small unique crab and morsels of delicious crabmeat - The braised soup and baked rice were my favourites but must also try the whole steamed crab and slowly dissect out bits of meat from various parts of the crab. Get one with crab roe and enjoy the rich flavor
