We ordered 3 types of chicken - teriyaki, bbq and deep fried. Good portions and serving. Service was very prompt for after lunch hours. Good value for money. Quite a spacious outlet.

We ate at this place quite some years ago. The place has been renovated, and is quite spacious. Prices remain affordable. For the price of an entree, you get to eat the salad buffet and unlimited drinks and soup too. Worth the value.

Great value for money!

It was to be a Birthday celebration with the family of 11 pax.A celebration with a difference with Western in mind. We had Steak, Black pepper chicken, fiery chicken & lemon chicken. Salad was in the Menu.Seated on a long table to fill more than 12, it was comfortable but go early to avoid the evening crowd.The salad, fruits & Soup, fresh & good.The mains were equally good in taste & variety.The whole restaurant entertained when the B.D. song was played & continue to play while the B.Day Girl (Wifey of 38 yrs) walk in with the grand children after a few rides of the "Paw Patrol" (an electric kiddy ride on wheels of S$3)Wifey was smiling widely & the many patrons clap on.It was spontaneous (thank all for your joy).We top up with Ice Cream on the House, & coloured sugar bits.All left with a heavy & fulfilling stomach

Came here for lunch recently with some colleagues. The pricing is pretty amazing: only around $13 for a chicken steak and unlimited salad. The salad selection was very good with reasonable quality ingredients. The chicken steak wasn't so great. Gets quite busy at lunchtime but no problems getting a seat around 12pm. Happy to come back for another visit

We went for dinner about 8.30pm after the movies. The place was crowded, but we only waited about 10 minutes. The food was well priced - we had chicken, pork chops and steak. Between $11- $18. There was the choice of two hot or cold sides, with options for everyone, including jacket potato, mac and cheese, corn on the cob, garden vegges, green salad and baked beans. Cost us about $50 for three with drinks. Very quick service

Went for dinner with my friend after our shopping on a friday night and had to queue for about 30-45mins. Recommended to go earlier.Food was served fast though my medium ribeye steak came as medium rare which I'm ok. The mini buffet is split into 2. cooked and raw/uncooked. Raw meaning salad, nuts, vegetables, etc. Cooked are the pastas, mashed potatoes, squid rings, etc. Drinks are also free flow. 3 types of soup was available that night. both cream and clear soup. Price was ok. I would say, value for money

I stopped by late at night while staying in the Marina Mandarin hotel and this restaurant was nearby in the adjoining Marina Mall... It looked busy with locals, with only one group waiting to be seated. At other times, mostly lunchtime, there were always long lines... So, I joined in. The way it works is that you order with a host/cashier, pay and then you are seated. I guess for Singapore the price is right, the unlimited salad bar is decent, and I think that is the main attraction for locals... You can literally stuff yourself until you burst. It's a concept most of my fellow Americans are familiar from Las Vegas casino buffets;)I had a ribeye x-cut (meaning a little bigger cut) with a baked potato, plus the free salad bar and sodas, or water. It all came to about SGD36.00, inclusive of taxes. Tips were discouraged.The steak tasted surprisingly fine, cooked properly medium rare. It wasn't a dry-aged ribeye, but given the price and buffet style it was OK, I can understand why locals like it. If you are a steak aficionado, you probably won't enjoy it as much

Went for lunch with wife and was very happy with the food. Wide selection of salad and soup. Mains were served in less than 10mins.

The salad bar had an incredible selection of quality ingredients and vegetables were v fresh. I ordered chargrilled chicken as part of their weekday lunch specials. It was juicy n tender. Coffee was also really satisfying. Highly recommended.

The quality of the beef here is reflected in the price. So don't expect good quality. Service is ok.

Had the 2x Ribeye steak for dinner tonight. The steak was cooked perfect. The price was a little high but well worth it.

Had lunch with three friends just the other day and we were all impressed by the better-than-expected qyality of food!
Portions were generous, wait staff prompt & courteous. Comfortable ambience with lots of rustic charm :)
Will certainly be back to try other offerings...

Our first time and arrived early to celebrate son's bdae. The staffs were friendly. Every each mains ordered, we are entitled to a free-flow of salad buffet and beverages. Quite a good and pleasant deal. Not expensive and the food is nice too.

We come to Astons at Marina Square every weekend and this place has never disappointed in the food. The freshness of the salad bar comes with every main course order. The food is comes in a very orderly main after you take you share of the salad bar and if u have not try this place you should cause it hasn't disappointed me. the let down will be that they don't take reservations and if you a big group do come early for lunch or dinner if not it would take some time for the servers to get you a table

We wanted to take a break from Asian food, so we tried this place, which was convenient to our hotel. It's basically an Outback steakhouse. The steak was O.K., and the salad bar had very good variety and was fresh and tasty. It's mostly self serve (including the drinks). Prices were O.K. I wouldn't come back unless it was for convenience

We were told that this place does not accept reservations, that means either you drop in immediately when they open at 11am or dine in much later to avoid the long queue (at around 2pm). We ordered all the Chicken Dinner (chargrilled, black pepper, hickory bbq, lemon lime, and golden fried) of which the most popular is the Lemon Lime - grilled to perfection, served zesty, hot and tender. At the price of $22.90, it is totally worth it with the supreme salad buffet of soup, salad, bread & cheese, hot & cold side dish, fruit & dessert, hot & cold beverage. Really wide spread of choices, highly recommended. On top of that, it is the service crew that makes it all the more worthwhile by providing above and beyond what is required.

First time in singapore found this restaurant in the mall. A little pricey I think but the food quality that is served and what is at the salad bar help makes up for it. Big bonus they served beer and wine. Ice cream machine was amazing best soft ice cream I've had since leaving the states with my job. If anything I'm going back to fill up on ice crea
