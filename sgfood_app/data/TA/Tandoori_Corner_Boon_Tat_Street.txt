A nice cosy place with tasty dishes. Friendly waiters .. good ambience..went there with 2 of my colleagues from Belgium and they loved it!
5
I come here for lunch sometimes . It is always packed with people which is a display of its popularity. The naan and chicken masala is very nice and portions just right.
4
For starters, this place has very quick service, delicious food, and a very spacy restraunt. I recomend this to people who want to chill out , or for people who want to look at the chinese temple around the corner of this restraunt.
3
This shophouse restaurant sells good Indian food at affordable prices.
Must try their chicken dishes and also naan.
4
We have been looking for good North Indian food in Singapore for a long time. We found Tandoori corner recently and it did not disappoint.The chicken tikka was tender and tasty and so was the chicken tandoori. The palak paneer was the best we had in Singapore and the raita was excellent. The cheese naan was ok. Service was efficient and friendly. Will definitely visit again
3
Came here for lunch today for a return visit after a gap of several years. The lunch sets are very good value at just $12 for a non-veg set (today was a lamb rogan jhosh curry with a few other veg curries supplemented with naan and rice and a small dessert). Friendly and efficient service. Food quality was average, but overall still good value for lunch
5
Thanks to TripAdvisor the great ratings we ended up visiting this restaurant twice. The lunch is set menu both veg and non veg available. Food tastes amazing and the menu differs daily. Staff are very friendly so is the owner. The dinner is A-La-carte . A definite must visit if need good Indian food, it's always crowded so be ready for bit waiting
4
A small restaurant but very nice food. Menu is short with set meal. really good quality food. staff is extremely nice, polite and friendly. have been there couple of times at lunch time and always found it packed with people and had to wait, which is proof of the popularity of this restaurant. Highly recommended. Will be back soon
4
We went with friends for casual lunch. The menu is short for lunch with some set meals and drinks. Liked the lunch menu. Food is good and tasty, quantity is also good. Staff is very friendly and helpful. Will go back again to try different thalis.

@TheKuoKnowsThis is probably one of the most authentic North Indian restaurants in Singapore. The Boon Tat Street outlet can be a godsend, if you are in the Central Business District around mealtime.The lunchtime special is perfect for an unfussy taste of India. Service is very prompt. But be warned - the restaurant can also be heaving with office workers. So be prepared to wait a little for an available table.The set-lunch menu at around $15 is more than reasonable. The Chicken Tikka is quite delightful and not too heavy, if you have a heavy meeting schedule in the afternoon. The Naan bread is perfectly thin. A sign of an accomplished chef.Tandoori Corner has got everything just right. Food quality is excellent; the service is top-notch and the price is affordable.
4
I has been to this place just a fews days ago , it amazing food and center of the city . Food is also tasty and delicious .
4
Excellently marinated with great flavours and cooked to perfection...
The restaurant can get very crowded at lunch time, so best to get there early if you don't want to wait in a long line. Look forward to going back for some great food
5
We live close by to this restaurant and are frequent visitors, the food is awesome and the staff are super friendly, to top it off the prices are very reasonable for the area, highly recommended
5
I have been there lot of time because of delicious meal .Best place of dinning North Indian food like to visited again .try to have lamb chop and fish tikka
4
Each time I visited Tandoori Corner there was a small queue at lunch time, which can be nothing but a good thing. The veggie set meal was really good, if a little salty. A perfect lunch spot.
5
Everything we ordered from galic naan to tandoori lamb cutlets,prawn cutlets butter chicken n rogan josh,everything was so mouth watering n yummy. Kids enjoyed the food n fresh fruit juice n lassi was so delicious. Dessert was great as we odered kulfi ..was too good. Would recommend everyone not to miss this great Indian tandoori corner,the best taste we had in Singapore.
5
I wanted to write this review since June this year when we were in Singapore. It was my favorite restaurant in Singapore and the server that work there is unbelievable nice. I am sorry that I forgot his name. I have his card somewhere in my wallet in Thailand. Everything there taste so fresh to me.The mint sauce was the best that I ever had. The vindaloo and tandoori were so tasty. I think they have the best vindaloo and I want to go back to Singapore just to eat that. Papri chart was the best too. I want to thanks this restaurant for the best food and the best service that they gave to me and my husband while we lived in Singapore
4
This is a fantastic little place to eat good Indian food. The menu for lunch is pretty fixed, but is delicious. This is one of my regular lunch joints. The place uses good ingredients, less oil. Do not go here for variety, but go here for a good and light set lunch menu
4
Tandoori corner is one of those Indian restaurants that makes good food, has good service, has great value for money and you wont mind eating here often, but it's not one of those places you'll think of on a special occasion or for fine dining. I've eaten at Tandoori corner many times and everytime I eat there the experience has been satisfactory. The lunch menu is limited but that ensures that it does not take long to order and the food is served quickly. The roti/naan is fresh, the biryani sumptuous, the vegetables tasty and the meat is flavourful and well cooked. I would not say the food is so good that I would go out of my way for it but I would not mind eating here a couple of times a week since the food is tasty and not unhealthy. This is an ideal place for having a quick lunch on a regular day with some friends or colleagues, just make sure you get there a little before peak lunch time and ideally with your entire group or else you could be waiting for a bit
5
I have eaten here many times, it is always good, the service can be short and try to up sell and they always have a line up at lunch, and from those that know Indian food well, they vote with their feet, it is always full. Limited menu. As along as you go with the right expectations that it is a rustic'ish place and the seats are closer together and you will feel certain time pressure to finish, the food is great
3
Good food but average service. Nightmare to pay the bill here using the entertainer app. They are poorly organised.
5
My colleague and I visited this restaurant during the lunch hour. I tried their veg thali and my friend tried the chana bhatura. The thali consists of 2 sabji, dal, naan and rice+ sweet. The food was excellent quality and quantity wise- in fact every item was very well prepared- not spicy and very flavourful. For the price that you pay - I would call the service, decor and sitting excellent. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone wanting to have good quality North Indian food at a very reasonable price. Just ensure that you have a cup of tea or coffe after the meal to ensure that you dont fall asleep in office after a hearty meal. Keep it up guys. Will visit again
5
The only good north Indian restaurant I could find in the talok ayer locality, serving authentic veg & non veg north Indian food.Quick & great service as well
5
Highly recommended for the great food, loved their daal makhani and tamatar ka shorba which they customized to make it spicy for me. And the cherry on cake is indeed the warmth and excellent service of their manager - Amit.
4
Tandoori Corner is one of the under-stated Indian dining options in Singapore. With another outlet on Balestier Road, this place never fails to impress with simple, delicious food, and unpretentious yet efficient service. A must-try if you are in this foodies' district of Singapore
3
The food is really good here, but the staff really need to up their game. For example, I ordered a chicken tikka and when I inquired about the missing mint sauce, the waiter pointed at the poppadom tray and said it was there! He then refused to accept the entertainer app because it isn't their main menu item apparently. Overall, great food but I may need to explore other Indian restaurants who are a little friendlier
4
This place is very near to my office and serves one of the best naan in Singapore. Do try their lunch meal option which is good value for money. The kheer is good too
5
Great little curry house. Best naans we've had, just like English versions! Good value and great staf
4
Been there couple of times with friends and family.Casual but good & tasty North Indian food.Set Meals or Starters or Chaas or Chana Bhatura, Samosa, Papri Chaat. All good quality .. My South Indians and Marathi friends liked it too!My Favourite Chana Bhatura never go wrong at this place.Thank you for lovely food
5
I love indian food, and this place definitely is one of the better places in Singapore to enjoy good North Indian food. Service is also excellent, and i like the papaddum that comes with every meal. Portions look small but are actually very hearty and meats very delicious and flavorful, without being overly spicy. Do order their mouthwatering butter chicken
5
Best indian food you will find at boon tat street...staff is really nice....if around that area do go for lunch.
5
Lovely Food, great staff. Felt like an English Indian, naan breads were outstanding, curry delicious and it's in The Entertainer also so good value
4
Casual restaurant in an area with several nice bars around.Great curry. The tandoori chicken was excellent and cooked from fresh.Reasonably price
5
Was a little home sick after 3 hectic days of park hopping.... Had developed strong craving for Indian food. So started looking for an Indian place for dinner. The place did full justice to our expectation. Delicious food ( kids could enjoy ) , extremely friendly staff and relaxing environment. Would want to go again
5
Wonderful N. Indian cuisine served with a smile! We visited based on reviews and, if anything, found this restaurant to be even better than advertised. Tandoori dishes are delicious, not over-spiced but flavorful. Chicken tikka is a "don't miss"! Naan is very light and melts in your mouth. Vegetable byranyi rice was wonderful. Prices are very reasonable and atmosphere is perfect. Service was very attentive; our waiter, Amir, genuinely cares that you enjoy the meal and even threw in a curry on the house so we could experiment with favors we had not tasted. He also walked us half-way to MRT station afterwards to ensure we didn't get lost. That's above and beyond. One of the best meals we've had in Singapore. Recommend without reservation....if you like Indian food, you'll love this place
4
Based on TripAdvisor reviews we walked to try this restaurant and we were happy we made this choice. A small venue but very friendly. The fish tikka was sensational and the tandoori chicken very juicy. We also had some vegetable dishes that were very fresh and flavoursome. Wine choices very limited but those that were available were pleasant enough. Unfortunately the toilet door is broken and does not close. Service was a tad slow to start but the apologies were profuse and we were looked after from then on. Also very pleasantly surprised by a complimentary glass of wine each.
3
The food was quite good, definitely above average but not flavoursome enough for my personal taste. Still a nice place to eat and drink
5
One of the best meals we had in Singapore considering how difficult it is to find delicious north Indian food here. But we were definitely surprised by the quality here. We ordered samosas which were "as they should be". The vegetables and naan were also very delicious and served quickly
5
Walked by this and went in by the look. We agreed that it was delicious Indian food, and later we discovered here at Tripadvisor the luck has brought us to a quite top rated restaurant. It's deserved
5
I was in Singapore on an official trip and was put up in Tanjong Pagar. I was craving for Indian food when i came across the review for Tandoor Corner and thought to give it a shot.It has one of the most tasty and authentic indian food in Singapore. And above all, the restaurant stands out for the hospitality and warmth of their manager Amit Rajak.While all the restaurants in Singapore levy a 10% service charge, irrespective of the level of service they provide, with Tandoori Corner you would definitely not feel cheated. Lot of credit goes to Amit who sets an example that you need not graduate from a Reputed Hospitality College or work in a 5 star hotel to understand the basic nitty gritty of services...Manis

I visited Tandoori Corner for dinner today and it was such an amazing experience! I knew I had to write a positive review about this place even though I don't usually leave reviews. Amit recommended a few dishes for the two of us to share and ALL of them impressed us so much that we ordered another main even though we were both so stuffed! First and foremost, all of the food we tried here was spectacular. I've been to a few Indian restaurants and none came as close to this in Singapore. The Chicken Tikki was grilled really well and the spice gave a nice kick to this dish. The butter chicken was very addictive and the garlic Naan, dipped in the butter chicken's amazing gravy, truly elevated the entire dish even further. We knew we just had to order another serving of the Naan even before we got to the end to scrape the last of it. This is my first time having the Baigan Bartha and it is safe to say it would definitely not my last. The vegetables were cooked perfectly with the different spices, giving rise to such a flavoursome dish.Those were the dishes that were recommended to us by the lovely Amit but we were so impressed, we ordered a serving of Rogan Josh as recommended by the other reviews. What can I say, I do not usually go for lamb dishes but I did not regret choosing this one. The meat was so tender it was practically falling apart as I picked at it with my fork. We were also very pleasantly surprised that the meat, while retaining some flavour, was not as strong as most lamb dishes that may become off putting. We also tried their Mango Lassi which was AMAZING and was the perfect complement to their spicy dishes. The Kulfi was also a very interesting dessert and was an equally great palate cleanser and a nice end to our dining experience.Service was nothing short of wonderful as well. We could sense how Amit was genuinely passionate about his food and he took time to check up on us and explain the different dishes to us. With such great service AND food, this gem of a place has easily become one of my favourite restaurants.If you're reading this Amit, HELLO! We're the people who visited your place today (a rainy Friday night). Your food and service did wonders to lift our spirits and we left the place so satisfied and happy despite the ongoing gloomy weather. I cannot say enough nice things about your restaurant. We would definitely be back with our families!

We went to Tandoori Corner after seeing reviews on TripAdvisor and where not disappointed. We ordered onion bhaji and where surprised at the size and style - rather than the traditional bhaji balls we have in the UK they where slices of fried onions with a tasty seasoning, we thoroughly enjoyed them.Was good value for money as well - about $45 (singapore dollars) for onion bhaji, butter chicken, chicken biriyani, regular nan, butter nan and 2 cokes.would visit again if in singapor
5
Tried their Chicken, Fish, Egg Plant for our first visit there. Food was so delicious that we ordered a bottle of red wine to celebrate this pleasant discovery. Service is very impressive too.We'll certainly be back again pretty soon
5
This is one of the good Indian restaurant that I love to frequent during lunch hour. Their Chicken Tikki and Naan are nice. Plus it's reasonably price as well. Lunch hour on a weekday can be quite packed, so go earlier if you want to secure a seat.Only thing I don't like is their dessert, which is a way too sweet for my liking
5
Very clean with a very warmful staff. We eat tendori, vegetable, starter recommended excellent, wonderful. Good value for money and food made with heart... Nice abounding. Go to the temple. The third one at the end of the street on the right side. Don t miss this restaurant in Singapore. Subway blue line station 18
5
I am not an expert on Indian food but I love the food at this Northern Indian restaurant....and have eaten there on each of my last several visits to Singapore. I was part of a group of friends and I ordered items based on my last visit --- each one was excellent. Not only that, the setting is just fine, the service is prompt and the pricing is very reasonable. The others in my party all enjoyed the food as well. My next visit to Singapore will definitely include a visit to this place once again
5
We enjoyed this restaurant so much last trip to Singapore that we returned. It was even better this time! The owners have a passion for cooking that shows. The best thing about Tandoori Corner is the variety of flavors in their dishes: many spices are blended in novel and delicious ways. Every dish was perfectly prepared, service is excellent, and the atmosphere is peaceful. Highly recommended.
4
Agree with all the reviews but an effort to find. I used the Map connection on Trip Advisor and it takes you to the wrong end of Boon Tat St. Put the address direct into Google Maps. It's actually on the corner of Boon Tat and Amoy Streets. The owner tells me a lot of people end up getting confused.
4
Tucked away in a quiet corner around Telok Ayer, Tandoori Corner was quite a find! The one funny thing though was the staff member that greeted (or did not) us outside the restaurant - the reception was definitely dragon like!However, we still persisted on and seated ourselves inside. The menu's compact - we got our regular - Palak Paneer (delicious gravy and seasoning), Egg Curry (again, yummy gravy - very well done), Garlic Naan (fluffy and flavoursome), Vegetable Biryani (nice enough but the vegetables were cut in rather large pieces!), and the Sweet Lassi (creamy and thick with a touch of rose water).The food was delicious - home style, non greasy with generous portions. We'd definitely go back for the food
4
We stopped here for dinner tonight. The onion bhaji, one serve, was a mountain of deliciousness. Too much for one person. We shared. The potato and cauliflower and chicken vindaloo curries were excellent, as was the naan. Including beer and wine the bill came to about $60 which was great value for Singapore. Recommended.
5
A good food cooked well. Staff very friendly and helpful. its really worth it to go and try some food
4
A good place to have lunch during office hours especially vegetarians are gonna find it worth. For 10 dollar one can have a vegetarian thali (plate) which is more than enough to calm down the hunger :D. Though the choice is limited but the food is pretty delicious :) The non-vegetarians do have lot of options which are worth trying (nom ! nom!)
4
We were tired, hungry and in the area, so came here based on other reviews. It serves better food than you may think at first sight so don't let a faded appearance put you off. We had very well seasoned and prepared chicken tikka and a refreshingly un-greasy butter chicken, done perfectly, so it was moist yet cooked right through. And the service was very good too, with a lovely balance of helpfulness and professionalism. Try it
4
Although not particularly busy, there was only one other table being used the night we went, they were doing lots of takeaway business with the locals. We shared a plate of onion bhaji which were cooked to perfection. My wife had the tandoori fish and I had rogan josh both very tasty. Would comment that menu choice was quite limited in my experience of Indian restaurants. However the bill was also pleasantly small as well. Would certainly use the place regularly if I were a local, so if in the area give it a try
5
A group of us dined here after a quick trip to Cafe Awesome, and the food was amazing, service was great and the flavours were incredible. We sent a scouting party ahead to ensure that we would get a table - I look forward to a repeat visit during my next trip to Singapore
5
Great little restaurant in the heart of Singapore. The menu offered a great selection, and the food we ordered (butter chicken, naan and tandoori chicken) was delicious. The staff was really friendly and helped keep my hungry 22-month-old daughter amused and distracted until the food came
5
We decided to go to this restaurant because of the good reviews on Tripadvisor and we certainly agreed with the recommendations when we sampled the food. It is a simple menu but had enough choices - we had the onion bhajis to start which were gorgeous - we ordered two portions but were advised not to have two because you get a lot in each portion and it was lucky we listened as there was a huge pile! We then had the butter chicken and the vindaloo and both were excellent. We also had a naan which was wonderful. Even the poppadoms were nicer than any I have had elsewhere! All this for a very cheap price for Singapore.The service was very good as well and everyone was really friendly and chatty. This place was a real find and I really recommend it to anyone who wants a beautifully cooked and extremely reasonably priced Indian meal in Singapore
5
I have been to Tandoori Corner )Boon Tat street= twice in the past 2 weeks, both times the food was outstanding and the service very friendly and efficient. I can recommend both the Prawn Masala as well as the Rogan Josh, the onion bhaji was excellent and the garlic naan one of the best I have ever had. Simply one of the best indian restaurants I have been to outside India
4
Highly recommend this place. A excellent, inexpensive meal, near Telok Ayer. The butter chicken, paneer saag and garlic naan was very tasty.
5
Most Aussies will have seen Tom and Ben's Singapore Sling and we're happy to say that it was well worth the visit! Stalls 7 & 8 did not disappoint and this place was one of the only places that sold beer at a very reasonable price! What a great and manic experience.
4
Look for stall 5... and eat eat eat eat!
A mix of meats, fish and prawns!
Breathe in the fragrant peanut satay and bustling hawker air!
5
Sensational night eating a large range of satays and drinking cold Tiger beer. The stall holders moved tables around so a large group of us from around the world could sit together. They embraced our rowdy lot and joined in the fun. Great value
4
My Singaporean colleague recommended tandoori corner to me and my colleague who was visiting from delhi. We had a lovely veg meal with friendly and efficient service. The sag paneer was delicious. I'll revisit for sure
4
A great experience for those not quite game enough for the local self-help BBQ street stalls. A good range of skewers, rice, and noodle dishes at reasonable prices. A friendly open air atmosphere in the closed-off street right in the heart of the old financial district
2
We had previously been many times to Tandoori Corner however when we returned on a Thursday evening we were very disappointed. The service had lost it's friendly touch and the food was bland and tasteless - especially the aubergine dish which was very oily and if you were blindfolded you'd think you were eating butter!! Most of the staff were focused on packing everything away rather than serving customers. We will need to find a new local curry restaurant.
3
We stopped in around 2 PM for lunch (they close at 2:30 PM). Very short menu of reasonably priced items. I had some Tandoori chicken and vegetable samosa. My wife had the Tikka chicken with okra salad. Very tasty. Not to hot. Plenty of water. Service was fast. SGD28
4
I ate at the Boon Tat Street Seafood kiosk located at Marina Bay Sands. While family-run Boon Tat's main outlet is at Esplanade, I'm told the older and better chef is at the MBS kiosk.FoodDon't miss the sambal stingray, served on a banana leaf, here. I had never eaten stingray before and was a trifle apprehensive because I dislike immensely "fishy" seafood. I wolfed it down in a jiffy when I first tried it - it is that delicious. The fresh stingray is grilled to perfection - not oily, smelly or undercooked. It is thickly coated with a delicious, slightly spicy, smoky-flavoured sambal. Choose a larger stingray as the small-sized ones are hardly filling.Service & LocationThe self-service outlet at Esplanade is often crowded and the stingray is popular, so be prepared to wait a while, even up to half an hour, to get your order. Finding a table or vacant seat at the table is difficult as the food court area is bustling with people. Value for MoneyThe food at this outlet is far more expensive than a street vendor, but this is understandable given the location and overheads involved. Tips for DinersThe sambal stingray is a must-have. Go with company - this way, someone can hold a table for you while you place an order at the kiosk. Be prepared for a long and fruitless search for a table in the noisy, crowded eating area.Overall ImpressionThe stingray is among my favourite foods in Singapore and I will make it a point to eat it every time I'm in the city
4
After reading some reviews on Tripadvisor, I decided to give Tandoori a try. And it was worthy at all.I was welcomed at door and the staffs always smiled with me. I was served the food immediately. It was a really quick service. The very first impression was all about the cleanness and tidiness of this place.I had a high regard of the tasty and fresh food. I especially loved lamb biryiani. Aww, so yummy that I would die for it.About the price, I gave this place a comment that: reasonable cheap :).I think this should be your must-be. Just give it a try
3
The meal along with a bottle of red wine was fairly good.However after dessert of Gulab Jamun and Kulfi(before I could repeat the word kulfi,manager said no we don't serve coffee)We found it odd that an Indian restaurant has a selection of wines and a wine chiller,yet find it hard to place a small coffee machine for customers as myself who are accustomed to a cup of coffee/espresso after a meal
4
Quick service. Good food. Space is a bit cramped. Always full during weekday lunch. Go there early or go there after 130pm
5
We were very happy with the reviews on trip advisor and went to this restaurant . It is a small Nothing elaborate about the deco,, but the food was very tasty, in large portion. The best nanas I have ever had, very soft and easy to chew, . I strongly recommend this place
5
My wife and I have just now returned to Asia and for our first dinner in Singapore we went with some friends to Tandoori Corner (the owner has two places -- this is the one on Boon Tat Street) and once again I was absolutely delighted with the food. Everything from the hors d'oeuvres to the home-made ice cream was scrumptious. The Indian style onion googies served as an appetizer are simply addictive! But every item from this Northern Indian menu was delicious; I highly recommend it. Note -- it tends to be VERY busy at lunch on weekdays since there are many offices nearby; best to go for dinner when it is not crowded
5
Boon tat Street is a busy street in the downtown core in the business district. Around 18:30 it is closed to traffic. Tables and chairs appear. Stall set up. Food is cooked. Tiger beer aunties circulate with large jugs of Tiger beer - $S17.50 each. All sorts of food available. We specialise in eating satay, with other dishes. Four people last night cost just over $S70 inc. 2 jugs of beer. It bustles, it heaves and it's great fun. Food comes to your table, from various stalls, you pay on delivery and I've never known them not to bring the change, so if they haven't brought it in 15 minutes, don't worry: they're delivering someone else's satay sticks, or nasi goreng somewhere down the street
4
We went there for lunch and got in a bit early around noon time. There were not many people and we got served immediately. It was also Holi festival and the staffwished us Holi and wanted to play with col ours. Food was great. Chicken tikka was delicious. By the time we finished food, the place was packed. Go in a bit early if you can but this is a Must try place
3
Been here a few times as not too far from work and wanted Indian food without waiting forever! The place is clean, staff attentive but not intrusive, menu not extensive but the lamb biryiani is good - which is why i returned here! the price for a dish is around 12$ (sing). Poppadoms are free and topped up when you run low which is great as i love poppadoms! Normally 3 or 4 others eating there in the evening so not crowded and therefore quicker service
4
My husband and I ate at this restaurant in May 2013 based on recommendations from TripAdvisor. We really enjoyed the meal (fresh and delicious) and the service was very friendly and obliging. We wish Amit and his family every success with their business and we will certainly return when we next visit Singapore
4
After reading the reviews, I thought I would venture to Chinatown for this little slice of India. With the help of the handy tripadvisor map, I found it without trouble. I was welcomed at the door and seated immediately. The menue was strait forward and had all the regular fare. I chose to have the Butter Chicken, Rogan Josh, regular nan and rice. All were great tasting. A very strong recommendation to trust this restaurant to serve good Indian curry. I will return when I am in town
5
We went because of trip advisor ,and we were not disappointed Wonderful fresh food great service.Went on a Monday night and had a meal. To remember .Will go again
4
After reading trip advisor recommendations we decided on an evening meal here. We arrived shortly after it opened, staff were attentive. The decor is questionable however it's the food that does the talking here. We ordered veg biryani and aloo ghobi with naan. Both were freshly made and tasted great. The bill was very reasonable. Wifi available upon request. We hope to return
4
We read the other reviews on tripadvisor and thought we'd give the restaurant a try! It was very quiet inside and the furniture outside almost made us pass it by however we are very glad we didn't. The food was extremely tasty and good value. The service was very friendly and offered sound advice on food options. The bringal is amazing with a lovely smokey flavour and I would return for that alone. Will certainly be back
5
Small cosy restaurant
Very delicious food with the right mix of spices
Flavours of fresh ingredients are delicately enhanced.
Service is top
A must try
5
As a Brit who has made a few trips to Singapore I've always been a fan of Little India. But imagine my surprise on running across this Indian gem in Singapore's China Town! We ordered food that we thought we had ordered before, but got something much better. Don't think about it just go, and if you are visitor go early enough so that you have time to go again. Great food, great price, great service
5
Took a punt off Tripadvisor and went to Chinatown to try out this curry house. Not the biggest place in the world but the food was so good. I went for the Lamb Tikka and Chicken Vindaloo which were superb. Service was spot on and I was very impressed with the quality of everything presented.So good I decided to go back on our last night in Singapore and was sadly disappointed that it closed on Good Friday!Will certainly be making a return visit on my next holiday in Singapore
3
I tried this place based on the review i saw here. First time trying the Chicken briyani rice there. It tasted good. The appearance of the food was not pleasing as it looked like the rice was just dumped to the plate and served. But it would have been better if there was slightly more chicken. The portion was just nice and it came along with some yogurt and dessert.I would suggest other to try this place but not highly recommend it as I have tried better tasting ones else where
5
Stumbled across this restaurant one Friday evening after work. We were in search of something affordable but comforting and this place definitely fit the bill. The restaurant was not busy when we walked in, which at first, was a little off putting. But once we sat down and were greeted with the very friendly and helpful waiter Amit we decided to stay. The food was mouth wateringly tasty and the bill after some starters, mains and wine was equally satisfying
5
I have lived and work overseas on a number of occasions, including 7 years in Thailand, Burma & Bangladesh. The food my family and I ate at the Tandoori Corner on 28 March, 2013, was up there with the best Indian food we have ever eaten. The staff were friendly and attentive, and we would love to have an Indian restaurant of this standard in Canberra where we live
5
I stumbled upon this location while walking around after a meeting in the area and was very pleasantly surprised. I ordered the Vegetarian Set Lunch (S$7.50, I think) and a mango lassi. While admittedly I've had better mango lassis, everything else was so, so good. The naan was perfect, the curries, were delicious, and to top it all off, at the end of the meal they brought out a single gulab jamun (I might be spelling that wrong, but it's a small donut hole like thing that's dipped in a sweet sauce). Maybe I wasn't paying attention to the menu, but I really wasn't expecting the sweet treat, and was totally pleasantly surprised. It was a perfect meal, and all for under $10
5
I've only eaten here once but they have left a wonderful impression on me and I can't wait to be back to bring my friends here. I always visit their other branch in Balestier as it is nearer to my workplace. Food is really GREAT. You can taste that they only use the highest quality ingredients. I've been to India once and that's when i learned to appreciate this cuisine. Prawn Masala and Butter chicken are my all time favorite. Oh, please add Cheese Naan too! Writing this review in the middle of the night leaves me craving for Tandoori Corner's cooking! I wish you guys do delivery. Do you?Service is fantastic. The owner is hands on and you will see him hopping from one table to another to check on his customers. What a wonderful individualised service!Highly recommended and will definitely come back soon!!!

Ate here on many occasions with my husband and workmates. Every time is spot on, the food is consistent be it for two persons or group booking. The staffs are very polite, helpful in making suggestions on food and the atmosphere is nice.I have made reservation on several occasions and the restaurant is very accommodating in the request. Everyone that I have dine with at this restaurant has nothing but good things to say about the food. They love the vegetarian lunch set, Bhatura, Briyani, onion bhaji, dhal, vegetable samosa and the naan comes out perfect all the time.So if you want the best Indian food, look no further as this is the place to enjoy it

It is funny that you have to go to Chinatown to eat at this splendid Indian. The staff is super friendly, the surrounding is lovely (the one you take your girlfriend/wife to). The food was refined and tasted very good. Try the Kulfi icecream as desert.Cost wise it was excellent value (chicken tikka masala 12.90, Kulfi 5,90).Oh yes, this is a lovely place
