Just finished the Mustang Burger, and Cracked Mayo Burger between two of us. Both were really, really good. Highly recommended. Great fries, good drinks too. Fantastic to see this is Singapore. Was crowded on a Friday afternoon!!!
5
Found this place by scrolling through trip advisor and went for burgers. By far the tastiest and most variety of vegan burgers I have ever had. All the drinks are organic and the ice cream is vegan as well. Amazing place at even better prices
5
We went there twice and regularly order from Deliveroo. It's delicious. Our favorites are Mustang Relish & Cracked Mayo. The fries are perfect even when delivered. Price is not bad. Perfect for vegans and will definitely please omnivores as well.
5
The Trufflebello and Tartar burgers we had were excellent, perfectly seasoned and decadent to eat. The truffle fries were outstanding! Wish they had them at the US Veganburg.
5
I ate here a few times before when I stayed in Singapore and the food and service were great so when I had a 8 hour layover I came here again. It's very close to Eunos MRT station, so easy to get to. The staff were very friendly again and the food was excellent. The choice of vegan burgers is very good. The thing many vegan places neglect is deserts, however here there is a choice of ice cream and how brownies are also on the menu. If I ever return to Singapore this will certainly be my place to eat at.

I have visited this outlet since its opening in 2010. The burgers are mostly amazing but nothing beats the Smoky BBQ burger for me. I always add Vegan Bacon too! The texture and taste of the patty is spot-on and if you choose the set meal (plus fries and fruit drink), it’s really worth it!
4
Quite hard to choose from the menu because there were so many to choose from. Thumbs up for truffle portobello burger which is from the special menu, it’s so juicy and every bites’ heaven to me! The breads are just nice too! Family and I are in love with their spinach potato balls. Won’t go for broccoli for set cuz it’s just very ordinary. My mom is a strict vegetarian, some burger menu allows us to go without onion and garlic. It’s very much appreciated! Will definitely visit again

This place is great to tend to your burger craving if you want to keep it vegan! The mushroom burger is my favourite here- it is juicy, tender and really flavourful. Worth a try! Ubereats deliver from here, which is great if you’re looking to oder in.
4
Tried their shrooms burger n BBQ burger!!The patty was great... the sauce was great ... the multigrain bun gave extra texture to the burger .... serving size was pretty big! But the seaweed fries were a little disappointing, tasted like ordinary fries. Overall, will definitely go back to try their other vegan burgers
4
Veganburg manages to tow that difficult like of being both healthy while also being tasty. The burgers, while sans meat , are juicy and filling. While not all the burgers are heavy hitters, the satay burger for example, with the added pineapple has a flavour profile that doesn't quite gel together. To get your bang for your buck, the full set seems to be a must. The seaweed fries are just salty enough but without a strong enough seaweed taste. On the other hand the provided drinks are fantastic. The choices are not too sweet so as to offset the rest of the meal but just sweet enough to be satisfying to oneself. Plus if you're too tired or busy to swing by the restaurant itself, you can always get it delivered. Bonus: there's a great focus on going green as the materials used to package the meals are all recyclable. The bottom line is, I love me my meaty burgers but Veganburg goes to show how a burger is more than just its patty. The combination of well sourced ingredients and interesting flavour pairings makes it more than the sum of its parts. I'll definitely be visiting this establishment a few more times.
5
Great vegan food for those transitioning to veganism or for people that just want to eat plant-based meals. Will visit again!
4
Smoky BBQ is great,
Love the Mayonnaise,
And "fresh coconut" on menu is really fresh coconut!!!
I would like to visit next time
5
Ok, not bad. Just that all the burger have the same soy patty with different types of bun and different veggies. But its good. Should try!
5
The burgers are awesome. Fresh coconuts from Thailand. So sweet. Don’t forget the durian ice cream. Zach was my server and he couldn’t of been more helpful and friendly. If your in Singapore and want a tasty fast food burger that is cruelty free?? Don’t miss this spot.
5
I have had my fair share of vegan food over the years and i must say this place is awesome. The flavours of the burgers are excellent. It feels like you’re having a burger rather than a mash of random vegi’s.I am definitely going to visit again
3
Limited seats in air-con area. Peak hour queue means the door is open/close more frequently resulting in loss of cool air for both in-door diners and the 'q-ers'. Perhaps they can consider self-order menu at the table for a better dining experience.Disappointed that you can't swop the chiller drink with black coffee to make it a meal; you have to add $2.70 on top of the $3.90 seems petty and unpalatable.Overall the burgers seem bland compared with the sidekick fries loaded with lots of mayo and salt.
4
Believe this is the world's first vegan fast food joint. Used to have more outlets and have since closed down to just one in Eunos.A bit out of the way but worth the visit. I had the cracked mayo while my wife had the mustang relish.The burgers are great and the star of the show. Choice of either fries (nicely done) or broccoli (too salty!) to go along with the combo meal. Note they have other sides options as well like soy sausages. Drinks are more of the sugared tea kinda of options like Ice Lemon tea etc.Will return to try the rest of their burgers
4
This restaurant has a good variety of vegetarian burger options all under SG$10, however to get a "real" fruit juice it costs SG$5.80 for a 250ml bottle, meaning either the burger is cheap or the drink is expensive; we'll go for the latter.Orders are taken at the counter and delivered, or collected in under 10 minutes.We found the burgers tasty and sufficient for us for lunch; others might need to add a side order of fries or broccoli.The background music playing was much too loud to our liking
4
One of the most expensive meals we had while in Singapore but it was worth it.The burger was large and very tasty and the meal deal including fries or broccoli and a drink was actually a very good deal.A good selection and very nice staff, very patient when having to explain to the woman in front of me that none of the burgers were made of meat when she was asking if they were pork or beef
5
Having a vegetarian girlfriend sometimes doesn't mean getting a meal which is satisfying for both of us when travelling through Asia. Sometimes however we find somewhere we both enjoy. This place has a great concept of vegan food and is done in a fast food style. The menu is really tasty and the food is served just like a fast food place, quick. The prices are even similar to that of a fast food place. If your vegetarian/vegan or want to try something new without paying too much give this place a visit
5
Finally get to try this! Yummilicious fast food! Burgers are huge in size and love the fries! But my partner feedback that the more u eat the fries, the more salty it gets! Will be back for sure!
4
my friend & i tried their satay burger & the hawaiian teriyaki burger, both were equally delicious despite the used soy patty, which i believe is very heavily processed. should have tried the el verde burger which is made of kidney bean & red rice
5
a must go for non-meat eater, lots of vegan burgers to choose from their attractive menu. Walking distance from MRT station.
4
Lovely meals here. The burgers taste great and the fries were especially good. Whoever says you have to suffer when you go vegan has not been here!
4
Travelled here as it seems a bit out of town but super busy!
Yummy burgers, great sides, friendly. Price not bad for Singapore.
4
if you are veg you definitely got to take time out to come here. its out of the way somewhere in the east but the trip is sure worth it !! as a tip get cheese on your bergs and skip the all the drinks. the service here has always been off so don't mind them. just sit eat and enjoy the meal :)psif the owners read this please have a look at your sin
5
Amazing food! Finally vegan burgers that actually taste good. I had the El verde burger made out of kidneybeans and red rice, with guacamole, pico de gallo and vegan cheese (tasted exactly like real cheddar!) with seaweed fries and vegan mayo and satay sauce on the side. Wish we had VeganBurg in the Netherlands!
5
I hunted out VeganBurg after seeing an article about it online. I was very impressed. The food was great. Fresh, tasty and ethically delicious. The service was friendly and the staff helpful and attentive. The place wasn't too busy but had a nice vibe to it
5
Great fast food that I come to because the food is delicious, not because it is vegan. creamy shroom burger is a standout - rich, satisfying and good textures. Fries are also excellent, and ther things on the menu like the vegan frankfurter are tasty. Great casual dining
3
The menu provides good variety and the quality of the items is good.However the taste for some of the burgers was bland.Tried the Shrooms, and beetroot/avocado burgers. The Shrooms was the best one; the sauce helped moist up the burger and make it taste good. The beetroot avocado was good quality but missing sauce.The soy patties are overall 3/5; seems quality but missing flavor. I personally prefer the quinoa/bean patties over soy.If you like vegan food you will enjoy this but it is nothing special or memorable
4
I ate a very tasty, out of the ordinary vegan burger here. I took the smokey mushrooms one and that was delicious. A very good place for modern vegan burgers.
5
Go for the smoky bbq cum fries! Nice personnel, great place, heavenly burgers, nicely presented. You gonna love it, even sd convinced eater of dead animals😉
3
Visited this Burger joint recently and found it good for vegans who are bit hesitant to eat burgers at Burger king / MCDs because of strict religious / dietary requirements. Worth a try. No guarantee you would visit it second time though!
5
Very nice and health food, u can enjoy variety of burgers under one roof, good for vegeterians, very hygenic, i often visit this place.
4
Visited with family. 3 yo daughter Iliked the kiddie meal. The veg patties were crispy. Nice ambience. Value for money!!
5
Never had such delicious vegan burgers. I tried most items in menu, it is tasty, healthy and not heavy on your tummy. Service is fast, prices slightly on higher side. Located just across street from eunos MRT. It is surprising -many people dont know about this place
4
Been to their other outlets too but prefer this branch in Eunos for the rustic feel. My favourites are Char grilled satay & Hawaii Teriyaki, and of course the seaweed fries. They do delivery as well, but will not recommend it as they have not perfected the formula to keep the burger taste as good as having it in house, so you end up with soggy burger. Dont expect Mc Donald speed here, so I guess good & healthy food take much longer to prepare? Also it is more pricey than Mc Donald.
5
I was craving for burgers and decided to try out Vegan Burg at Eunos for some healthier fast food option. There is a substantial selection of burgers to choose from. Patties are made of soy and its really delicious. I ordered the cracked pepper mayo burger which was simple and tasty. Definitely able to taste the hint of black pepper with each bite. Burgers can be bought ala carte or made into a set meal where you will get to choose between a side of seaweed fries or broccoli and a drink. I chose to have the seaweed fries and it was served hot and crispy. Instead of the typical soft drinks, you get to pick out one of 3 fruit punch type drinks (refillable at a cost). The soursop drink was nice but could be better if its served colder.Lots of seating at the Eunos outlet both indoor and outdoor. The only downside is that the location is out of the way and it's not exactly located at a convenient spot. However, this definitely will not hinder me from making more visits in the future for some tasty vegan burgers.
4
This place is not very central - it is out east in Eunos but worth a visit. If you don't like burgers then don't bother but if you do there are plenty of options. The food is tasty, the service is good & quick, the surroundings relaxed (seating inside & outside), it's open late and was reasonably priced. I've been back a few times - recommended for vegans and non-vegans alike
4
According to the lady who works here, there are only two Vegan Burgs in the world. The other one is in the US. This joint was founded by a Singaporean and the food is great! I like how they are burgers made with GMO free soy patties and lovely ciabatta bread. The ones with mushrooms taste just like meat burgers The soursop drink I had was great too. And I can't wait to try their Brown Rice brownies and ice cream
4
burgers served here are good in taste and the cold drinks were fine as well. We had char-grilled Satay and mayo burgers.
Location is a bit far if you live in central region
5
Honestly the best vegan burger I've ever had. My only complaint is there's not one back home. 10 / 10
5
10/10. Both my sister (serious meat eater and fan of junk food) and myself (vegan) had a great meal.
5
We came here for 3 days and ate here 3 times. Our choices included Smokey BBQ, Tangy Tartar, Creamy Shrooms, Char-Grilled Satay, and Mustang Relish. We also got sides of Seaweed Fries, Chillin Broccoli, and Spinach Pops. The meals include a burger (priced from about S$7-10) plus a supplement of S$4.90 for either fries or broccoli & a drink from the tap. Firstly, hands down the best burgers I've ever had, meat or no meat. I've only been vegan 1 year and VeganBurg fills the burger hole I've been missing. The prices are reasonable for Singapore, especially compared to The Loving Hut, another vegan restaurant- but it's still not cheap here. The food tastes fresh and is made to order. Our favourites were the Tangy Tartare, Mustang Relish & Creamy Shrooms. The downsides were: some of the burgers were slightly dry, including Creamy Shrooms & Char-Grilled Satay. The Char-Grilled Satay was also not very spicy, which it had claimed to be on the menu. The Mustang Relish in my opinion contained too much mustard, which took away from the relish flavour. The Spinach Pops were also slightly overpriced at S$4.90 for a small portion and they were very small. The drinks included in the meal were refreshing, but tasted very artificial. They had also run out of ice-cream, which was incredibly disappointing for us. We purchased the chocolate cake instead, which we actually returned because it was dry, artificial (not fresh), and tasted old, as though it had been sitting out for a day or two. The upside was there was always space, although it was never empty- it's a popular place it seems. And the service was very good, friendly and efficient. They also have free wifi- great for travellers. Unfortunately the toilet facilities didn't leave a great impression- the one toilet they had was small and could be updated and more clean. Overall I highly recommend the food- for "fast food" it was certainly fresh and flavoursome. The buns are fresh and fluffy, and the menu choice is extensive (although mostly burgers). After going 3 times the food was consistent and I would definitely return! I'd love to see a VeganBurg at Singapore airport & actually worldwide. I'm from London and I know that it would be very successful there as long as the food and prices were consistent with Singapore. It's a little pricey, but worth it for the quality. A rewards scheme would be nice, as we did spend over our food budget, and it's difficult to only visit once!

I tried the new Hot Dog with french fries dusted with seaweed. It was delicious with jalapenos. Recommend to those who like to add a little spice to their life, My friends tried the Cracked Mayo and Creamy Shrooms. The cracked mayo is their popular burger with lettuce. The creamy shrooms with lightly sauteed button mushrooms w as tried by my two other friends. They liked it
4
We have noticed this outlet at Eunos for many years now and decided to pop in out of curiosity. It was packed and there seems to be a perpetual line at the order counter while we were there. I would have never expected vegetarian burgers were so popular. My son and I ordered a set meal each Avocado Beetroot and Creamy Shrooms both with crispy soy burger. The burgers were really tasty without any added sauces. We picked up a side of the seaweed fries and the broccoli. The broccoli was not cooked and was a challenge to swallow. What I also liked were the tropical fruit coolers. The soursop was very good.Cost was high though for a fast food meal
5
Tastiest burgers for vegans in singapore .Pepper cracked mayo burger awesome. Spinach pops make me melt. Handmade brownie tastes very very yummy. Chewy and chocolaty. Few burgers were soggy for me and I don't prefer. But my friends did love them. Always busy for homedelivery Must increase Homedelivery
1
After initial enthusiasm when discovering the restaurant, I was deeply disappointed when I wanted to order home delivery and that wasn't possible. On my first visit I asked the manager until what time they deliver food and he answered the food orders will be taken every day until 9 pm. When I called some days after, at 8:10 pm, their answer was they were not receiving any more orders. No special reason. Even though I told them that was not what they had explained to me on my first visit and the fact that I leave only 5 min away with a car or bike and the order was meant for 2 people only, they just kept repeating; "Sorry, there is nothing we could do for you". I tried to "help" them by giving them alternatives (in case they had miscalculated the potential amount of orders and the ability to deliver all the orders) or recovery service when not able to fulfill there promises, the answer was always the same. They can not do it. I have to emphasize that my order was not a request to deliver out of their delivering time or out of their delivery zone or out of their menu. It was just a simple order, which they had committed to deliver until certain time. No "subject to availability" or anything similar mentioned. That is why I insisted (unsuccessfully) for order to be delivered. Options were not closed - they could have sit on the bicycle and deliver by themselves in 10 min, they could have ordered a taxi to do so or order for me at Food Panda and pay the difference. Or even offering me a small discount at next visit or free ice-cream, for example. Anything to show they care and they are truly sorry for not being able to deliver their promisees. No recovery service was offered, even when giving them clear ideas.You have a long way to go to learn basics about customer service and understanding "sorry" is not enough. Believe me, there is always a way, even when nothing runs smoothly or when you have unpredictable circumstances. You just need to show that you care. In your eyes it is "only" one lost order, in my eyes it is about one lost customer which could lead to many more.

I love burgers. I've been a vegetarian for 6 months.I'm content now, having finally eaten here.It's located near the Eunos MRT station, quiet despite being along the main road.The interior was bright, neat and cosy.I had the Mustang Relish (crispy soy patty) with broccoli and seaweed fries as sides.It's not a big burger by any measure, but the bread was decent enough and the patty more than fooled me that I was having a regular ol' patty. Strangely enough, the broccoli and fries did it more for me.Then again, I understand that may not be amongst the best burgers that it has.All in all, I will come back here again and I am a pretty lazy eater
5
Drive past thid shop almost everyday. Finally decided to enter to try.Visited Vegan Burg. Each set meal inclusive drink is about $13 (little costly). There's no waiter service in this outlet. Placed thr order and made payment at the counter. Collect a ringer. When the ringer alarm sounded, collect the food at the counter again.Cosy little restaurant with estimated capacity of 20 -22 persons. Burger is tasty. Parking is challenging. Best to park at Eunos Crescent HDB car park and cross the road over. Nearest MRT will be Eunos, thereafter walk about 7 minutes to the outlet
4
My experience was not quite up to par. The burger was tasty but had a sauce on it that I ended up scraping off.
4
I had a meal with 'Creamy Shrooms' burger. Absolutely delicious and seaweed fries were yummy. The drink tasted yummy and home made and not over Seet and all for $11.
Parking was tricky around the restaurant but that's the only downside.
5
It's my first time to eat this kind of food. Surprisingly, it's delicious! To be a vegetarian or a vegan is not that bad.
A vegan day a week gets you in the pink of health and the world green!
4
This place serves vegan burgers.
Amazing stuff.
Service is efficient.
Different from other burger joints.
Certainly worth visiting.
They use soya in their patties.Tastes great.
5
My all time favourite is the cracked mayo burger. Yummy. And the bread is super soft and tasty. The chips are nice and crispy too. For a healthier choice, you can go with the boiled broccoli instead. For drinks, I would recommend the soursop juice. Extremely refreshing
5
I'll start by stating that I'm not a vegan - not even a vegetarian - infact I love meat. However, I decided to given Vegan Burg a go with my wife and 3 kids (11, 7 and 3 years old) - and it was well worth it. There is only one location now in Singapore - 44 Jalan Eunos, and its a bit hard to get to - as its on a main street and the taxi had to use a side street to get us here.The burgers are fantastic. I had a crispy soy burger, while my wife had a mushroom burger. They even had kids meals including meat free hot dogs - which my 7 year old wouldn't believe was vegetarian. For sides they have chips or broccolli. Everyone in the family loved the food - and I would highly recommend it
5
That was exactly what I needed after traveling for a while. I was craving for a Burger and was not disappointed. Coming from Berlin I am spoiled with vegan options but this was fastfood on an higher level. Try Mustang Relish, Smoky BBQ, Spinach Pops and the Brown Rice Ice Cream. Mmmh what a treat. Thank you
5
I have always wanted to prepare vegan meals but was a little reluctant that it may not taste great because there is not meat. Vegan Burg proved me wrong. Tried the Char Grilled Satay and Smokey BBQ and they were so good. The minestrone soup is nice but taste salty overtime and the mushroom soup is ok but not to my liking.A meal can be little pricy but that's pretty average for a vegan healthy meal. There is a student meal deal but only during a certain period of the day. Service was good. The outlet is pretty spacious and comfy too. Cons is that there is only one outlet and its so far. I guess because its located at a not-so-popular place (i.e. town) so there is not much customer every time I come by for lunch. And the location will not stop me from visiting again because I would love to try the other burgers
5
I visit his eatery regularly, at least once a week. The ambiance is very nice, the foods are good and it's the best vegan restaurant I've had so far! The staffs are really nice and friendly, especially Angela and Danika, they are very attentive and care to the customer. Well done
5
We ate both Creamy Shroom and Hawaii Teriyaki set meal (include one seaweed fries and one broccoli) . Add two mushroom soups and one spinach potato. The portion is just nice for a lady but it may a bit small for a gent. I must say the ingredients are fresh. The buns are soft with nice texture. The atmosphere is good, staffs are very polite. I will back to this restaurant to try other burgers someday.
4
The other night, I headed to Vegan Burg for dinner with my family. My parents are vegetarian but I'm not, so obviously I complained. After all, the food was amazing! I love the idea of French fries with seaweed instead of salt, they were delicious!!
4
Had lunch here. Burgers were delicious and a great alternative to normal fast food. Food is all prepared to order and fries were outstanding. Highly recommend
5
We ate lunch at vegan burg and had a wholesome vegan meal. The burgers and hot dogs are to die for. We even packed burgers from here for a later meal :). You get vegan coffee and desserts out here as well. This place should surely be visited especially if your vegan.
4
The burgers buns are soft & fresh. love the creamy shrooms burger. Purchase of burger can be top up with either fries or healthy steamed broccoli & with one drink @$3.90. A burger set can come up to $10.90 - $11.90.Best selling burgers are creamy shrooms, char grilled satay & mayo burger.They have a paleo burger option too. Tried their brown rice ice cream. Its tasty & nice.Worth checking out and i will definitely return again for another try.
1
I was literally jumping when I found about this place thinking that I will finally get to eat some vegetarian burger. My friends and I ordered 3 different burgers. But horror horror!!! They were sweeeeet. How in the world can someone make sweet burgers??? And on the top of it, the patties were made of soya and they were disgusting. We struggled to eat it after 3 bites and ultimately, none of us could finish an entire burger. The only good thing was that it is a small pretty place and close to mrt
4
Thus outlet serve variety of vegan burgers made from scratch using organic and GMO free ingredients. I have tried satay and tangy tar tar burger meals which come with a soft drink and fresh shoe string fries. You can try their spinach potato balls too! The burger patties and buns tasted fresh and tasty and sauces completed the patties really well. Try their less 2% fat ice creams to end your healthy meal. The price is on steep side but for the quality of food, it's worth every single cent
4
Our family enjoys VeganBurg burgers and fries because of the taste, even though we are not vegetarians. They have a good variety of burgers and even have vegan hot dogs. We also enjoy there flavored drinks. We were sad to see that the Turf City location has closed down.The service is fast, so it is a good option for a quick meal. The only change I would suggest would be to offer more choices of buns, as one of my children doesn't like the taste of their hamburger buns
4
Vegetarians rejoice, because now you can enjoy a guiltless yet healthy burger that is wholly vegan! Veganburg is like the vegetarian version of what a Macdonald’s or Moss Burger would be, just no meat and everything vegan. For those (open-minded) carnivores out there, it really isn’t as bad as it sounds, really.The concept of a vegan burger place is an intriguing one and while the concept is fast food, it does cost slightly more than the average MacDonald’s meal. However, it is still affordable and reasonable enough (all that effort and nutrients that go into those soy patties, not to mention the creativity of the vegan burger combinations!). And just as with the usual fast food outlets, Veganburg offers the choice between just the burger or topping up to get a set (with comes with fries and a drink which you can select Subway/Carl’s Junior style – any drink of your choice from the dispenser). Sauces (e.g. chilli and ketchup) are also self-serviced from dispensers. I had the Creamy Shrooms (which is apparently rich in copper and potassium) set which cost S$11.80 (the burger alone would have cost S$7.90). The seaweed fries that accompanied the burger were a delight – crispy on the outside and soft and fluffy on the inside with that tinge of familiar tasty subtle seaweed flavor. If you were just eating the fries alone, you would not be able to discern that you are in a place that serves vegan burgers!Don’t be deceived by the size of the burgers! We had planned for some dessert but after the burgers and fries, not to mention drinks, there was no room for more. It was a very satisfying and filling healthy dinner.For more on the experience and photos, please check out my blog: http://www.travelbytez.com/2014/07/veganburg-eunos-burgers-with-vegan-twist.htm

This was my first experience of a vegan burger and it was delicious. There was a good selection of different burgers and both mine and my colleagues were delicious. If you order a meal it comes with either broccoli or fries and a juice. The MBFC branch was well decorated and ambience was busy but pleasant. Around 20 dollars for two
5
Two words: Creamy Shrooms!!What a pleasure! Went there for a big breakfast (very big breakfast) and planned to come back before leaving Singapore but we couldn't make it!! :( All the options we tried were very yummy and fresh, but the Creamy Shrooms was the winner!One of the best vegan burgers we ever had (words from 2 vegan travellers spoilt with options in London).The seaweed fries are addictively good and the spinach pops are superb!!A must visit for vegans and non vegans
4
Kept really low expectations, but the place deserves a round of applause. We tried Creamy Shrooms and Mustang Relish burgers and both were exceptionally good. It was the organic ice cream (made with brown rice and chocolate) that stole the thunder!
5
Loved this place, was great to have western based vegan food. The place was funky and friendly.
Staff were nice and polite. Will definately spending alot more time when i'm next in Singapore.
5
I say 2 thumbs up to VeganBurg! Food is great. Mustang Relish is a must try. And they play really good music. Noice playlist! While you're at it, get some sidekicks, too!

Heard of VeganBurg sometime ago, but never had the chance to try this plant-based diet fast-food restaurant. Today I finally had the chance to step into this pretty fast food restaurant and trying a burger made entirely of healthy, organic, non-meat ingredients.The menu was surprisingly interesting, with different-flavored burgers such as pepperd mayo, creamy shrooms, smoky BBQ, char-grilled satay etc. They even have seaweed fries, for those who are in love with McDonalds' offerings.I had the Creamy Shrooms Burger (SGD$7.90). At that price, it sure was not cheap for a fast-food burger, but the burger was rather large, with its crispy whole wheat ciabatta bun, crispy vegan patty and bed of fresh button mushrooms. The burger was bursting with a delicious peppery flavor, but the overall texture was rather dry. The "creamy" portion was an over-promise as well. Don't get me wrong - the taste was still pretty good, just that a little more grease or juiciness would enhance the overall taste of the burger greatly.Thankfully I had the Chillers (SGD$2.80) which was actually a free flow rance of miami peach, lemon loco or citron cooler soft drinks - these helped to cope with the dryness of the burger very well.For full review and more photographs, please feel free to visit:http://thearcticstar.blogspot.sg/2015/01/lunch-at-veganburg-mbfc.htm

Ok, so normally I stay away from veggie burger places. I love vegetarian but the burger joints often taste the same, totally generic. This one doesn't. The soy bean patty was really fresh and tastes unique, great. The bun was super fresh. All the ingredients were good quality, the sides are nice and the place has a cool relaxed vibe. While a little expensive for a burger etc it's cheaper than most gourmet burger joints, and certainly worth it for the quality of the ingredients.
4
It was my first visit and I was pleasantly satisfied with the food. The choice of burgers were unique. I was spoilt for choices and I eventually settled for the Hawaiian Teriyaki although I originally asked for Creamy Mushroom. I had to admit that I was curious how the vegan frank would taste like and my verdict was..they were really awesome (and tasted like real sausages!) The restaurant can be a little small but there were ample of seats outside. The queue for order can be a little long too depending on the hour but good things usually come with a price, eh? Parking spaces are limited if you are driving. Will definitely return for my second visit
3
In a glance, Vegan Burg offers healthy fast food as it serves burgers and side dishes in vegetarian style. I'm not exactly sure how healthier it is from the usual fast food, though. But their menu choices are quite unique, and the cafe is nicely decorated.Ala-carte burger is priced between $5.90-$7.90. Top up for side dish and a chilled drink. The burgers tasted okay, but not fantastic. Couldn't taste the seaweed in the seaweed fries.Service was almost non-existing, as it's only available in the counter where we placed our order, and the rest is self-service.All in all, it's a cool place with unusual selection of burgers, but I won't come back for the food alone
4
I hate to complain but came a couple of years ago when it first opened in Eunos and must admit I was surprised the menu's exactly the same nine burgers with a special (potato hash rendang) of the day that seems to be the only thing that changes. The little they do, they do well, I'll give them that. I wasn't too keen on the rendang and hash burger which is one more simple carbohydrate than I like in a meal. I'm gluten intolerant but I think I would've have thrown caution to the wind for want of something with a more chewy texture like a meat substitute. And I don't even eat meat.The atmosphere and predictability was like being invited over to a well-intentioned aunt's who's all right one supposes but somewhat tightfisted and overly frugal with her portions served under dimmed lights to save on electricity. Bordering on bleak. Not enticed to visit again soon. Sorry

I've always loved vegan food, what more fast food! Tried a few of the burgers and can never go wrong with the Creamy Mushroom. However came in the evening for dinner @ Turf City, upset that much stuffs are out of stock, broccoli, thai coconut, and i'm left with not much choice but to order fries(love the seaweed fries!) and dispenser drinks. $12 for an average meal, i will come once a month to enjoy these burgers as a treat ;

We regularly go to the outlet at MBFC for lunch, and have noticed how the service over the past year complete degraded.The food is nice and predictable, although quite greasy and they are a bit too generous with the high calorie sauces.However, at our last visit only one table was occupied when we arrived and ordered. Some people came after us and ordered the same food and they all received their meals before us (same burger!). When we asked what happened to our order the staff apologised and said that there was a mix up because it was so busy - at that time 4 tables were occupied, and they don't do deliveries over the lunch break. We had to wait a long time before our food came out and witnessed in between food been taken away from one table and handed to another table that was also complaining.The restaurant also stopped honouring their loyalty cards- which they made you pay for a year ago.Our visit last week was probably our last visit altogether

Great choice of fast food for vegan and vegetarians. Price is a little bit on the high side. Feel quite healthy after eating. Interesting sauces too like the satay sauce.
5
Being a vegan, there are already limited choices. My fellow vegan friend always say 'vegans can't be choosers', but oh well, Veganburg really has the yummiest burgers ever. My favourite is their cracked mayo, with broccoli sides. :)
4
Been here a lot of times.What I liked: Fast preparation time. Just about SGD 12 for a healthy half filling lunch (burger + fries / broccoli + a cooler). The fries are very tasty! I liked Hawaiian Pineapple burger the most. What I didn't like: Not many options (as the name suggests, its just burgers
5
This is the place where I had my first meal in Singapore and had been a fan of this place since then. Jalan Eunos outlet was close to my workplace, hence have tried everything in the menu and I can tell with confidence that they have got awesome burgers and each one is worth trying. Would strongly recommend dining instore as a lot of burgers become soggy if consumed little late

My brother -in- law took us there for lunch. It's a healthy fast food joint. Not much food selection. The mushroom burger is good. (but the size portion is small) The place is clean and the staff is friendly. I could not know where to find this without someone took us there. One thing though, the parking is terrible. I still think Veggie Grill in L.A. is the best

Came with a vegetarian colleague. Have been wanting to try for some time as I drove past it. Was surprised to see them touting themselves as a healthy fast food joint :)Mostly soy based patties. As I sometimes have gout, decided to skip the soy patties and opted for the smokey BBQ which uses mushrooms. Burgers are priced between 5.90 to 8.90, and you can have a meal for an additional 3.90 which comes with fries or boiled broccoli and a drink. Came to $40 for the 4 of us. The ladies of course said it was sufficient, but me, I was thinking of ordering a second helping. Decided not to because I couldn't get a 15% discount! which you can get if you sign up online and pay with Nets for min order of $20The smokey BBQ has the usual BBQ sauce taste, which was a tad sweet for me but the caramelised onions were nice and sweet. There was sufficient lettuce and the organic bun was nice and soft.The broccoli was a bit soft for me, I prefer them crunchier, and the seaweed fries were nothing to shout about. Drink had interesting name (mine was a citrus something or other) but you can taste that it's not homemade.It was a bit noisy as the place is not that big. But you could sit outdoors if you don't mind the heat and prefer less noise in the background (though I could be wrong and you get traffic background noise)Would I come back again? Only if I had a vegan friend and couldn't go to a meat place :

Went with my wife to their branch at the Grandstand on Good Friday. After visiting Pasarbella, we headed there for dinner at about 7pm. Luckily it was not too crowded for a Public Holiday and we managed to find seats easily. But because we had taken a late lunch we only have space for a burger and a snack between us. Thus it took us a while to decide what to eat and we finally agree to try their Char-Grilled Satay Burger and Vegan Franks. As a non-vegetarian I was pleasantly surprise that their satay burger is actually quite tasty. With the satay sauce and the onion rings it tastes almost like having regular satays. As for the vegan franks they are even better than the "real thing" and we couldnâ€™t stop eating them. They are really chewy with a smoky flavour, and I find it hard to believe that they are actually mini tofu sausages. My only complaint is that they are slightly oily. That was my first time I have been to VeganBurg and I am definitely going to try their other food items

We found ourselves at Veganburg Eunos quite by accident but what a happy accident it turned out to be! The happiness of a vegetarian being able to walk into an eatery (esp. in SIngapore!) and be able to order ANYTHING on the menu! There is a very decent number of options on the menu, it's not the cheaptest burger you'll ever buy but the quality is outstanding and that's what you're paying for.Very nice spot, very good food, friendly staff, happy patrons. What more could you want

I visit Vegan Burg at least once a month. This is my dream vegan fast food store. You can see many fast food stores in every city. But, it is very difficult for vegetarian (like me) to enjoy a delicious + 100% meat free + pure vegan meal in single fast food store. I almost tried out all the burgers in Vegan Burg. Every burger is perfect. It is delicious. Especially, the burger bread they used are different compare with most of the fast food store. The bread contains sun flower seed. Vegan Burg has give many non-vegetarian a healthier fast food meal. But, I would feel happier if they reduce use of paper/plastic plate. I would still support Vegan Burg even it is a bit pricey

We came here for lunch and each ordered a set. Cracked Mayo w/Fries, Citrus CoolerMustang Relish w/Brocolli, Ciris CoolerFood was good. Hit the spot if you are craving "fast food" but don't want to hate yourself afterwords. Fries were awesome, Brocolli ok. Vegan Burgers tasty. The citrus cooler is really good lemonade. But S$0.50 extra if you order without ice. From the prices, around S$20.00 for 2 sets, margins are not that tight so the extra cost for no ice is a detractor. The atmosphere is eclectic/cool. And the music not too loud. There is plenty of outdoor seating as well. Employees are polite. All in all a good place to grab some grub.
5
Really nice menu and settings. Friendly service especially from Elizabeth. Clean and fast. Everyone should try it out even for non veg eaters!!!
2
Clean. Trendy. Been a vegan for several years. Too bad the Burgers doesn't have any taste in this place. Came twice to give another chance. Won't come again.
5
happy to find another vegan restaurant in Singapore! Good was great, portions not too big. Had smokey BBQ burg with fries and Citrus cooler drink. Also tried spinach balls and franks.
4
Been here regularly. Service is good and its the most guilt free fast food going. Great atmosphere! Best to get a full meal, the vegan ice cream is a must.
5
i love veganburg. after quite long time searching for the vegan stuff that meet my taste,i finally found this one at 44 Eunos. The Char-Grilled Satay is probably the one that i adore most!! perfectly combined with seaweed fries + vegan franks + citron cooler. even if you are not a veggie,i would still recommend this plac

This is vegan junk food and I loved it.I went to the branch near Marina Bay Sands and got the deal with a burger (mushroom), fries (rather small) and a drink. It was delicious.I also tried the spinach balls and the ice cream and they were super yummy.However the next time I tried to eat here I went to the branch on Market Street and it was closed.I was quite upset as I had wanted to get food to eat before my flight out and I had rushed to get to the store before I had to go to the airport.The opening hours of the store are clearly listed on a sign posted on their shopfront and it was within the listed times. Yet the lights were off and nobody was there.I had thought how great it would be if they could open a branch at the airport but now I think that might be a bit ambitious as they can't seem to keep the stores they do have open when they should be

Been to 2 locations, Turf City (3 times) and Jalan Eunos once. The locations are out of the way for tourists - around 15-20 mins from Orchard area by taxi.Remember this is a Fast Food place / restaurant. You order at the till and clear up your trays on leaving.The burgers at Turf City taste really good with generous fillings to complement the burger and is hot when served. The side orders / fires are a small portion. The same could not be said for Jalan Eunos branch. There was little taste in the burgers here due to lack of fillings and they were served barely warm.The "Spinach"poppers should be called "Potato" poppers with spinach. As noted by others, there is very little spinach in them! They're good as a side dish with one of their Gourmet sauces. If you want your greens, then go for the Broccoli, this was fresh and cooked just right.The cold drinks they serve are refreshing, with or without ice.Jalan Eunos was very busy with about two thirds of tables taken. Those that were free had piles of empty food trays and left overs which previous occupants had not cleared away. Keeping the place clean for those queuing to order did not seem a priority. Parking in on the street if you can find any.Turf City branch is newer, clean on every occasion we've been and never crowded when we've visited. Nice environment to sit and eat. The service is slow but the staff are friendly and make you feel welcome. Free parking here!Overall: go to Turf City branch if you want to try out this Vegan friendly place. In comparison to other similar places in Singapore - it is very good. Hence my 4 Stars

I have been here on several occasions and tried a different burger each time. My favourite was the Sassy Relish burger. The fries were really great and enjoyed my meal very much. Definitely a good choice for healthy burgers and especially for vegans and vegetarians :)The receipt offers the promotion of a free burger for when you spend over $30 in the Marina Bay branch. I'm going to use that on the last day of my holiday here
5
Lovely atmosphere to compliment the nutritious and delicious food! I first was introduced to Veganburg at Zoukout and it was the highlight of my night! Ever since then I frequent the restaurant once a month. I wish the delivery was a little more prompt, sometimes waiting for 3 hours.
5
Visiting Singapore from Perth, Australia, I was advised that I should give VeganBurg a try.Wow, was I in for a surprise. It was awesome! I have now tried all of the burgers and they're all super tasty! The patties are juicy and taste great, and the buns are soft and have nuts and seeds baked in to them, so they're healthy too!I'd highly suggest anyone visiting Singapore (or any local) tries it out
2
Interesting decor, cool motorbike, endorsement by Sir McCartney but horrible horrible food! Like vegetarian a lot, but this....no way!
Still would encourage to try it out for yourself, to recalibrate your benchmark....
5
The food is awesome. Although some burgers are nicer than others. I love he decor. And the music. I bring my work there to complete. Nice place to chillax.
2
Worth visiting once. Apparently the favorite place on Mondays for Paul McCartney, I was told I had to go just once. Whilst the concept was interesting.... the Watery tangerine crush... And Hawaiian teriyaki burger were really not what I would call 'quality' . Although a hard core vegan was with me and he loved his cracked mayo meal and citron cooler. I must confess its the first place in town I found pineapple on a burger. The buns are very floury. The one thing I will say is that their love heart ice creams are a great idea and the basil chips are worth the visit!!

I had creamy mushrooms burger, fries and spinach poppers. The burger was good - besides the gluten stuff, it is nutty. Its got real mushrooms and what seem like wilted down spinach. The fries has a mild taste which i like. The spinach poppers - no spinach taste, tasted 'previously-frozen' and i thot it might be tater tots. A big no to this side order next time. The location was terrible - no parking space close by. i gather the closest decent parking is near the eunos mrt station. The service staff seemed a bit blur and unsure - gave us 2 spinach poppers when we only ordered 1. we returned one. Kind of made me double check on my order - but everything else turned out fine
4
The food at VeganBurg is like vegan crack. Seriously delicious. Yes, it's fast food, but it's organic and well done. My go to is the creamy pepper mushroom burger. The sauce they put on it is amazing. The textures and flavors are spot on, and the burgers are a good size to fill you up without being too big. I've been to the Eunos and the Golden Shoe locations. The only downside to Eunos is that it's out of the way, but they often have vegan desserts at that location whereas the one near Raffles does not. Highly recommended

This is about the new branch at The Grandstand (former Turf City off Bukit Timah).Went there on a Friday with the wife, we were the last clients. We tried two burgers and the "hot dogs", with fries and their potato balls.Eating vegetarian burgers for the first time, I was surprised at both how tasty and how satisfying the meal was. As we came in late, they had already switched off the deep fryer so the fries were a bit cool, but the taste was still impressive.They don't sell the usual softdrinks but have organic alternatives. I tried the cola and it was just great, much better than coke.The reason I don't give 5 stars is the cool fries. Otherwise, an excellent experience and we will surely come back

I read about Vegan Burg in the newspapers and food blogs. I heard about it from meat-eaters telling me the “Mega Nice” Vegan Burger at VeganBurg. When I crave for Vegetarian Fast Food and Burger and I would ended up at Vegan Burg .I love most is the Creamy Pepper SMushroom Burger that is creamy, peppery and mushroomy.It is the most satisfying burger that I ever had. The vegan patties inside the organic wholemeal bun is crispy, the sauce is tastefully and just love the peppery taste

I am not a vegetarian, but I do eat vegetarian food quite often. I was excited to see that there is a vegetarian burger store in Singapore and went their immediately. I have to say that while I was not too impressed with their burgers. I do commend them for making a bold move into this market though. The burger patties could be juicier. Service was a bit slow for a burger. Now what really makes this burger joint stand out is their assortment of healthy juices

Yes, you've guessed it right, it's a Morrissey song, I just tweaked it a little, okay. I moved to Singapore just last year and I think that this country has a lot to offer, gastronomically speaking. Living here is varied, and no two days are ever the same. From the people, to the places, and the food of course!There are two things that I'm looking forward to this February: Chinese New Year and Valentine's Day. Why? It will be my first time celebrating them in Singapore. How am I gonna spend it? With food! If you’re concerned about your health like me and can’t get your fill of fresh, organic ingredients, you are going to like this! I know that there are some dudes who love greasier, “meatier” foods, and for them, this article should be titled “What Would Probably Bore Me.” Trust me, VeganBurg will appeal vegans and meat-eaters alike! I’ve searched high and low for the best places to experience an inspiring yet healthy fare and only VeganBurg is the [soy] cream of the crop! It was, how do you say, a tasty decision!First off we have Chinese New Year. For some reason, whenever I hear Chinese New Year, I always get that Siouxsie and the Banshees song "Hong Kong Garden" stuck in my head. I've always wondered what Chinese New Year is really like. Good thing I found out about the Mandarin Fortune burger. I'm not that adventurous when it comes to Asian food but I think I'll definitely dig this one. It harnesses that local flavor but at the same time is cleverly infused with that 'All-American' burger feel - sans the cholesterol and animal fat. What makes this burger extra special is the zesty orange sauce that is smothered over a juicy vegan patty...delish! Oh, and did I mention this is a limited edition burger? You had better get your hands on one before they're gone!What's the best way to impress a girl? Shoes? Labels? Make-up? Jewelry? All wrong. Everyone knows that being humane and healthy is hot so this Valentine’s Day, treat your sweetheart to a romantic dinner packed full of plant-based goodness. But wait...did you know that there’s a scientific reason that meat-free fare can be a recipe for romance? Healthy vegan foods will leave you full of energy and vitality. VeganBurg's Grandstand outlet is the perfect destination for the big night. If you want to spice up your love life, then hook up with these [vegan] burgers! You'll love the always alluring, Char-Grilled Satay or the sinfully good Creamy Pepper Shrooms burger that practically melts in your mouth. Or, why not try the passion-inpiring Smoky BBQ burger (add a slice of pineapple to achieve that perfect luscious combination). And of course, there's always the classic Cracked Pepper Mayo burger, which my girlfriend loves. And you know what, I'll even ask VeganBurg to make heart shaped burgers just for her! So there you have it. Eat. Enjoy. Burp

Please build a location in Shanghai!!! We were visiting Singapore on vacation and just happened to stop in Veganburg since I like veggie-burgers (I am not a vegan/veg). It was AMAZING! I had the cracked pepper burger, inhaled it, and wanted to order a second one immediately after! Too bad I don't live in Singapore, I would be here every day. Even my meat-loving husband loved my sandwich, and my 3 year old LOVED the kiddie meal!! I was going to eat his leftovers, but he finished it all. PLEASE open in Shanghai!!
5
Ate here twice during a business trip. Highly recommended, but take cash.
Burgers, fries, drinks and sides are all delicious. The restaurant has more charm than fast food chains.
5
I cannot believe that vegan burgers can be so tasting, this place is seriously amazing!!! Please open one in Perth ASAP!! I really believe that Veganburg should go worldwide...

Found this place on the web and decided to give it a shot. The servings came in mess tins, the type used by campers. The burgers are awesome but they could be more generous with the fries. The only disappointment is they ran out of ice cream on the day of our visit. Glad there is an alternative to regular fast food restaurants which don't serve vegan food

It's hard to dine with friends who are vegans. I tried going that way once but I must have done it wrong because I became listless. That said the food here is delicious. I had to try to the hot dogs that, in a blind test, would fool many people. There are daily specials and, with the standard offerings, make for a wide choice for even the most dedicated carnivore. Others have written about the healthy drink choices available (a refill is 50 per cent of the price of the first cup; an excellent deal). I had the beetroot and carrot, and while this is not a freshly squeezed product, it is quite acceptable. Curiously, I did not find it as sweet as the fresh version. We also had the char grilled satay and pepper shrooms (why?) burgers and both were scrumptious
5
Not at all what you might expect from something vegan. Really delicious, good value and healthy and not skinny sized! Had a veggie burger with pineapple - really tasty combination and had a beetroot mixed juice which was yummy rather than barely palatable as per many 'healthy' options. Felt like a treat - Will definitely go bac

My wife and I are meat-eaters but we decided to give this burger joint a try - given we live in the neighborhood and wanted to try something healthy. In a nutshell, I found the place quite inviting and warm, the staff friendly/helpful (but not the most knowledgeable when it comes to explaining the food), the food tastly and of good quality, and the price, reasonable. I have the creamy shrooms burger and the wife had the creamy pepper burger (both with seaweed fries). We also had the hearty minestrone soup. All the ingredients were fresh and definitely organic. After eating here, I'll be honest and say that we're still not prepared to give up eating meat - however, if and when we do, this will be one of the few places will visit. Worth checking out

Went to Vegan Burg outlet in Golden Shoe yesterday. Went just before noon, so beat the lunch rush and ordering was a breeze. This was my second visit, so it's fair to say I quite liked the burger and fries I had on my first visit and I brought my wife along for her to try it out. I went for the Creamy Shrooms burger with fries and a drink, while my wife chose the Satay burger and a minestrone soup. I requested my burger to be made fresh with less cream sauce, which they were happy to oblige. So far so good. The issue started when we had our first tastes of the soup. It was the most watery, tasteless minestrone soup I could imagine. So I went back to the counter to ask for salt and pepper. The cashier asked her colleagues and told me they had no salt and pepper whatsoever to offer. I found this rather strange given this is a food joint, but maybe I'm mistaken and all their food offerings are devoid of salt and pepper. To add insult to injury, one particular staff member (the guy making the fries) had this look on his face that was a combination of dismissive, annoyed, surprised and possibly one or two other things... certainly not a look an employee should be giving to a customer making a simple request for salt/pepper. In the end, my wife had to add a spoon of ketchup to the soup to make it edible, which is a rather sad statement about the quality of the soup. But the burgers and fries were pretty good, as they were on my previous visit. All-in-all, I'd recommend their core burger offerings, especially to vegetarians who may yearn to replicate the wonderful experience that is a good burger and fries for meat-eaters (I myself am not a vegetarian). Kudos to management for devising and executing on a unique concept and delivering good core offerings. But please work on the soup, and please, please train your staff to be polite to your customers. You don't want to risk the below-par service staff ruining what may otherwise be a good long-term business building opportunity around your concept

It's not easy being vegan in Singapore and veganburg can hit the spot when you have a hankering for sustainable fast food. Typical processed soy patties were nonetheless good tasting. Kids likedThe hotdogs and fries were great. LOVE that they don't sell regular sodas and have healthier drink options. Tried the BBQ burger, yummy but skimpy toppings and the teriyaki burger, too sweet for me but sure some folks like it. Will go again when I get a craving for veggieburger in S'pore
4
Another option for vegans / vegetarians to try out some high quality burgers and experience a burger place / burger meal. Vegan burg claims organic ingredients make up its patties, breads and fixings - the result was definitely tasty and the offerings looked very fresh. I tried out the creamy pepper burger (not sure if this was vegan) meal and would definitely approve of it as a tasty offering, well presented in a wholemeal bread. The fries that came on the side were quite crispy and the fruit juices offered as part of the meal were high quality indeed and this definitely makes for a healthy meal. Not having tasted real hamburgers, I cannot vouch for the authenticity of the taste or texture as a substitute, but these are among the best soya patty burgers I have tasted
4
It is a simple place, nothing fanciful but practical. The burgers are yummy, which is very surprising. Being a vegetarian for a long time, I have long given up any hope for people to come out with good recipe for burgers - since most of the time there were disappointments and nothing else - but this place surprises and impresses me. Definitely a place worth going to - even though it is a little out of place - and the food worth trying out
