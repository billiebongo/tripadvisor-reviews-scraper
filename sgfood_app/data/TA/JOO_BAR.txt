Our first visit 6 mths ago found this to be interesting and quirky. Now everything from the service, menu, cleanliness has deteriorated.

Went to Joo Bar for this first time on a Friday night after work. The restaurant was full and we were lucky to snag a table without reservation but had to return it by 10pm as it was reserved.The 4 of us shared soy chicken wings, LA style Korean kalbi short ribs, pancake and Army stew. We liked everything although the pancake was abit too oily for us. It also turned soggy quite fast, so eat it while it's hot. We order Mrs their non-alcoholic drinks; would love to try their cocktails and soju next time.Music is Korean pop and you may need to speak a little louder for your friends to hear you. But this adds to the atmosphere. The customers are mainly young people and there were many pretty people. The staff are friendly but not too attentive; can't blame them as the place was quite packed. I plan to visit again to try other dishes and drinks. This time I will make a reservation first

It was nice and cosy and great for gathering with friends for drinks and food though I was there with family and with 2 young children. But I still got to try the lovely makgeoli and food was interesting. staff were attentive though I I think they can smile more..they are friendly but perhaps had to look cool? Interesting menu with different kinds of kind for different type of people from adults to children. Had army stew (expect a small portion, i think i can finish it alone so dont expect the usual size for sharing), the grilled squid was nice, mushrooms too amd if you need some meat, the pork was rather nice. Drinks were great. Will visit again and next visit, gonna try more drink

went for a friend's bday, staff were pretty friendly, and the place was pretty packed. enjoyed myself some bit except for realizing that they overcharged or inserted additional items into our bills (we had taken turns to buy drinks and charge it to each of our credit cards), which unfortunately we only found out after. pity, would have been a return customer if not for that

The owners and cook are Singaporeans but they have many good looking Korean waiters. The crowd was young and good looking too.The food is not traditional Korean but fusion, modern interpretation.I had mangalitsa pork kimchi stew, chapjae with chicken and kimchi bacon pancake which were all delicious.The desserts were fusion too. The creme brûlée and chocolate gateau were excellent!Many Korean soju. Not expensive. Recommended

quaint chill place for korean food. DIY bibimbap is a draw. though not that many ingredients to choose from (and certain items may not be available that day), the overall presentation and taste did not disappoint. the cold brew is not bad too. prices are generally affordable

Been to Joo Bar a few times and their food does not disappoint. Not traditional Korean yet their touches of kimchi, hot soups, and good quality meat definitely nod toward good Korean dining. Their slow-roasted Mangalitsa pork belly was melt in your mouth pork belly and the Wagyu Bombs was the bomb - juicy, tender, flavourful. How am I going to try other items on their menu if I keep going back for this?Their cocktails were interesting, with names unlike anything I'd come across before. All of the drinks I've had there were fine, but fine is all they were - nothing so amazing that justified the artisan cocktail prices at other places. They cocktails seem to mostly contain this thing called "Joo Brew," perhaps something I didn't particularly care for. I couldn't figure what it was though - when I asked the staff, they couldn't explain it to me either. If you're ordering alcoholic drinks, be warned that water comes with a $2 price tag, which I disagree with. If you're ordering drinks, establishments should be socially responsible enough to make sure you keep hydrated over a night out drinking with your friends!Probably the most disappointing thing about Joo Bar is the service. Even if the Bugis area is a catchment for kids, paying Joo Bar's prices, I'd love to have seen wait staff more enthusiastic and passionate. There are a couple who are truly awesome but most of the others are kids themselves who seem to see it as just another job, who can't answer questions about their menu

Have project outing at this place. We occupied level . Drink is good as I saw everyone is happy drinking especially Makgeolli. Basically I feel the food here are quite good although the price is high.Food that I feel really nice and I will order again.The Grilled Mangalitsa Belly is best. Very good to go with any drink.Sizzling Mushroom Trio - nice although I feel having mushroom at this price is a bit priceyHand-chopped Korean Minced Rib Steak - this is really good, will back for this.Joo BossamBelow are average to me so I will leave my stomach room to othersHoney Butter ChickCheesy Bacon Kimchi Pancake is special but slightly too salty for me. Army Stew - taste good but with this price, go elsewhere to have i

Super yummy Korean Mexican fusion. Tried everything on the menu. The kimchi mac and cheese is pretty unforgettable. Will be back again.

Be SURPRISE on your birthday.
Friendly staff around.
you must try their Makkaegoli( Rice Wine),which is totally one of a kind.
Food may be pricey,but within mid range.

Food is ok, not as good as some other places. Lack of Korean authentic taste. Maybe is due to the fusion cuisine so it might not taste as authentic. Ambience is good but food could be better in terms of taste.

Went to Joo bar yesterday to celebrate my friend's birthday and to catch up.I must say that I love it!From the drinks to the well executed dishes.I must say I was quite doubtful of the dishes as its a bar after all and I have way too many experience with terrible Korean food.But this was really good!It can be a little pricy but it is totally worth it.Some of the servers are Korean and they are very well versed in their English. I will recommend this place for date nights or hang outs

It was an impromptu night out. We were early and lucky to get seats cos i heard this place fills up fast. Was eager to try their home brew makgeolli but it was a let down. The makgeolli slush was better though. The popular Passionfruit flavour wasnt available that day so we went with Yuzu.Food wise - it is just average. The pancakes were below average, truffle fries ok, but saving grace was the Kim Chi Mac & Cheese. Come to this place for the ambiance and makgeolli slushes, anything else you can try elsewher

Joo bar is a good place to loosen up. We make an advance booking to avoid disappointment. But still we only managed to dine up to 9pm on that Friday as there's another booking at 9pm. Joo is located opposite Bugis Junction at the 3-storey shop house, it just 5 minute walk from Bugis MRT. They serve a variety of Korea alcohols and yummy foods. I love the interior of Joo, is cool and stylish. I feel very relax with the dim dark lighting. The Korean staff are quite friendly and good looking. Definitely Joo is a place with standard. The prices may be a little pricey but their servings are definitely good to share and tasty. Must Go

Love the ambience of Joo bar, seems like a cool and hip place to chill out after work to have a few drinks and bar snacks with friends.They have pretty cool snacks on the menu, like the honey butter chicken, paper eel and also nice drinks like the Yucha Sojurita.Our bill came up to $200plus for about 6 persons, pretty pricey considering it's only bar snacks and drinks with no mains. But we enjoyed ourselves and the food

At first glance, well, you might miss the place as the sign is not so clear. It is however quite well located and near public transportation and decent amount of parking space.Bar below is dimly lit but the second and third floor areas are spaced well enough for small groups of people. Having said that, I believe it's best to go there with 4 people of or more and try and mix and match dishes. It's a Korean fusion place, so don't expect fully authentic Korean dishes. I like the slow roasted pork, chicken tenders and the seafood pancake to start, or just nibble on yummy truffle fries (fried in truffle oil)I do come more for drinks, and I'd recommend to newcomers to try the Makgeolli sampler and Sojurita drinks. I always drink my soju with a dash of lime, so I always ask for wedge cut limes and a pinch of that on my soju shots. (I originally asked for calamansi, but they don't have it, so I've gotten used to it anyway)Although I know some of the staff there and they are very friendly, I can see that service does need to step up a bit, particularly during really busy times, else the ambiance and food experience will be ruined by bad service

Service and food quality was below terrible. I don't blame the staff but clearly it's a consequence of poor or no management. Did not feel welcome from the beginning. Waited outside for 40 minutes with reservation. We would happily enjoy a cocktail while waiting but they didn't even bother taking orders. No one was telling the staff what they should do.When the drinks finally came, the waiter spilled some on my white shirt. He apologized but left without saying anything. 5 minutes later he came back with napkins and offered a jar of water free of charge as a recovery (they charge $2 for water). To top it off, they overcharged a dish - unfortunately I only found out after heading home

Sour Plum Shot is very good. Pricey though at $50 for one tray of shots. Too sweet though, if its sweetness is lower would be better.Food is okay, I dont like the taste of makgeolli but my friend said it was very good.Ambiance is excellent. Love the low lights.Ring a bell an service staff will be with us soon.Spend about $249 for 2 pax. Thats because of the one and half tray of Sour plum shots which cost $80, makgeolli sampler @ $35, makgeolli one jar and the rest are food.Will go back again
