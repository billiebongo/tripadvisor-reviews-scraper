Went there for brunch with friends. A nice place for a casual day-out and food was reasonably priced too.
4
It was never disappointment at Prive. I enjoyed the beer and food ( Cajun chicken burger) at Prive. The atmosphere was great. Good place to catch up with friends.
4
An ideal place for weekend cozy brunch. Love the all-day brunch and the cool, green surroundings. Friendly staff.

A nice place to have a lazy relazed brunch. Staff are very friendly. The open-air ambience of the place also adds to the experience. Family friendly

Had a lovely lunch at Prive CHIJMES with some colleagues to celebrate a birthday. Fantastic service by Prive CHIJMES who provided us with a complimentary birthday cake, along with candles, sparklers, a polaroid picture, and a birthday card all thrown in free. The staff went the extra mile to switch off the fans so the candles won't be blown out, and was fantastic in cooperating with us to keep the celebration a surprise. The food was great, albeit a little pricey. The ambience was brilliant. We were seated outside, which can be a little warm in the afternoon, but there were outdoor fans which helped cool the place. My suggestion would definitely be to make a reservation for indoor seats. Great place for casual catch-ups, formal meals, celebrations etc. Would definitely recommend

Ordered a cheeseburger for my toddler from the kids‚Äô menu and the beef patty was not well done. Sent it back and it still wasn‚Äôt done right. Gave up. Was not served dessert which was included in the kids‚Äô set lunch. Did not realize it till later. Ventilation was bad in the indoor seating area. We were smelling like food after a while. There are way better brunch/food options in the vicinity.

I love visiting Chijmes when I am in Singapore though this was my first visit to Prive. Despite the restaurant being very busy I was shown a place to sit and quickly served. Food was ok having ordered the BBQ burger and then a cliched Singapore Sling to drink. Atmosphere was great full of locals chilling out and having fun and service was excellent and friendly. Shame the burger wasn‚Äôt as tasty as I had hoped for
3
The food can be better, especially the straight cut fries which I think McDonald fries would taste better. Ambience is nice with a singer performing live at the lawn next to the restaurant. Quite windy. The no. of staff is few and quite a feat to capture their attention. I would return again for the ambience only
1
Sadly I cannot comment on the food or drinks at Prive as I left before I even was given a menu. The staff look like they don‚Äôt want to be there. I sat alone for 10-15mins after waiting to be seated with no acknowledgement or menu. I watched others seated during this time either having to ask for a menu or food or drink or the billWhy bother even trying. This is not the first time I have been here and had a similar experience I thought third time lucky but no Better places to go
3
The food was ok, but the service was bad. The restaurant wasn't full that day. We requested to change the table because where we sit was in the corner close to the kitchen area. They refused to do so with many excuses. So, finally we moved to sit outside instead. Until we finish our food, the restaurant (inside) still never full
1
Terrible. Dopey waitresses and I got charged $70 for a glass of white wine. Took ages to sort out the refund. First and last visit. Food was also average. Steak sandwich, steak was cold and chewy and I had chicken pesto and it was dry.
3
Overall nice place, service was good, food & drinks alright. Nothing outstanding but just nice place to hang out with friends
3
Food was average but the ambience is good with alfresco dining and a band singing in the outdoor. Service is prompt.
5
nice environment, good service, good food.
50% during happy hour!
Rain cover could have activated faster tho
5
The place is very chill to hang put with friends, There was a wide range of food and drinks. The staff there was very nice too.
5
Chill place to be at, staff was very attentive and food was awesome, portion was also big! There's a lot of menu choices too!
5
I went to Prive at Chijmes on a weekend and I have to say I really loved the ambiance of the place. Do note that all seating is outdoors so may not be ideal if it is scorching hot outside. I have been to Prive at other locations and the quality in general has been consistent :)
5
My first review done subtopic style!Ambience: Surprisingly nice despite it being crowded. The tables were well spaced out and I got one with the long bench at one end. My wife sat on it and the cushions provided were nice!Food: The Forest Mushroom Soup was really good. Just the right amount of saltiness and texture and the truffle oil added to the tastiness. The slice of garlic bread was heaven! I had the the Tofu Teriyaki Toast (vegan) and it was sizable and full of ingredients: shiitake mushrooms, cracked wheat, navy beans, squash, green onions, caramelised pineapple and pickled vegetable ribbons, served with romaine lettuce side and a bowl of potato crisps. Tasted good but I wished it had slightly less sauce. My wife had the Chilli Crab Spaghetti and it was an above-average portion too. The sauce was tangy and a perfect complement to the nicely al dente spaghetti. The mud crab claw was fleshy and cooked well. We wanted to order dessert but we were just too full!Service: We were seated and served by Reggie who we assume was the manager as he was running the floor. This guy exemplified all that‚Äôs good about service. He was polite and friendly and had obviously high EQ. Whenever we needed something, he appeared miraculously! Two other lady wait staff who served us were very good too. Probably following the fine example left by their superior. Reggie is truly an asset to the establishment
4
My colleague and I went Prive for lunch. I had their Eggs Benedict as I‚Äôve heard a few good reviews on that. The outdoor seating area is a good place to chill be it during lunch or after work drinks. It wasn‚Äôt too hot with the trees above you and its shades, and the strong fans around the area, but do be careful of the extra ‚Äúleaves‚Äù in your food. Their service was good too. Overall I love the Egg Benedicts which I‚Äôve ordered! Their muffins taste so special. FYI they do not have set lunch promotions
3
Lovely looking place, set in CHIJMES (pronounced Chimes, acronym from Convent of the Holy Infant Jesus Middle Education School), overpriced coffee and average service. The thing that soured my milk was the inability of the barista to draw the lines between the dots: kid would like some chocolate powder on her babycino, we don't use chocolate powder in our caps, awkward silence.It took wifey's unlimited patience to direct the gossiping team to add some chocolate from the hot chocolate. LKY has produced a people of unimaginable ability at following orders while never thinking outside the box. The plus side is that you will feel superior, sup supping away in the old convent grounds
5
Please try their truffle mushrooms pizza, mushrooms soup, seabass, laksa etc etc - delicious. Compliment's to the Chef & team.
Compliment's to Tony, Don, Jeremy, Kang Xing and Janice - 6 stars service üëç
5
Always like to have dinner at prive as the ambience is relax. Will go there again definitely.the food also good.
5
Thank you for all the staff serving at Prive Chijmes. My friend do enjoy her birthday celebration here. The service and food are excellent. :)
5
We have been to this restaurant a few times for lunch but this was our first breakfast. Great choice, pretty reasonable prices and the food always tastes great.
4
Not advisable to go on a hot sunny day as there is limited shelter shaded seats. Same goes for rainy days. Food spread was good but due to the layout of the restaurant, not easy to get staffs' attention if you are sitting at a corner.Would prefer going to other branches.
5
I have been here several times and I never enjoyed drinking like this before. I usually sit at the bar counter and was able to chat with the bartenders ‚Äî Paul, Joel, Sara. They‚Äôre pleasant to talk to as well as the their drinks.I never ordered specific drinks whenever I come here‚Äî except beer, which is always Irish ale.In several instances, it was Paul who prepared me drinks and was suprised with several concoctions‚Äî passionfruit daiquiri, lychee martini, espresso on the rocks, lime margarita on the rocks
3
Happy that Prive is vegetarian friendly. Gonna be a mushroom lover today, ordering Forest Mushroom Soup (S$10++) and a 10-inch stoned baked pizza - Truffles Field Mushroom Madness (S$19++). Plus a smoothies with a beautiful name - Mango Tango (S$9++).Love the Mushroom Soup and Mango Tango very much
4
Visiting SG we visited this jewel for the first time and felt extremely at home. What a wonderful location all around. Many restaurants to choose from with many different kitchens and flavors. This place was a very good citizen to this space. Very nice and helpful staff, good dishes with very interesting flavors ans spices. Delicious
5
Had a very nice team bonding lunch at Prive Chijmes. Staff are very friendly and helpful. Food was served in just right time, not too long waiting time. Food was tasty. And lovely birthday card and polaroid photography from Prive! Keep up the great service! Will definitely visit again and bring my family there
5
The waitresses are always on the go. Make sure you have everything and even small thing as filling up your water and taking away the utensil box once you started eating and change to tissue box.My best impression was when I called for the bill, they brought a birthday cake and sparkle for my husband ! They took a photo for us and gave us a birthday card with the photo for our memories. Glad that I choose Prive to celebrate my husband's birthday
4
Tried the one at Asian Civilisations and it made me feel home. After going around, the place gives a good comforting feeling while enjoying a long black and the sight of Singapore river. They serve some salad and pastries.
5
The location, atmosphere, service, menu & price was just perfect for a Sunday lunch with the family!!
4
Memorable birthday celebration. Thanks so much for the sparklers fireworks, lovely birthday card and photo from the restaurant!
4
The waiters and waitresses are friendly and responsive, and foods are great! Ambient is excellent too.
5
Kudos to huge serving of food from desserts to pastas to drinks. I love the ice cream with chocolate! Friendly waiters and staff, too!
4
It was my first time at Prive Chijmes. I was meeting a friend and was given the task to choose the location. I chose Prive as it had a nice ambience and appeared to be a ‚Äúhappening place‚Äù and we were not disappointed. The happy ‚Äò2 for 1‚Äô hour worked well and we had copious amounts of beer. We ordered the pork corn shrimp and Cajun wings to accompany our drinks, and later the local Hainanese Chicken rice and Nasi goreng. We were served by Zi Kang who was at all times very attentive and offered suggestions, and finally recommended the after dinner drinks in particular the whiskies which we were happy to comply‚Ä¶ All in all a pleasant evening. Will definitely come back due to the great service. Customer service has dropped significantly in most FnB establishments in Singapore and it was a treat to see a staff member who took his job seriously. We wish Zi Kang all the very best 
5
Love this eating place, very good decorated. Foods are delicious while serving speed is fast as well. They are very thoughtful & sweet enough to compliment us a sliced of ‚Äúanniversary sponge cake‚Äù while they know we were celebrating our anniversary! Will definitely go back again
3
The food is average, not the best but still quite nice. The atmosphere is good. Though it‚Äôs after raining, it still have the mood there. However, the service isn‚Äôt that well. Order wrongly is alright, but to request what type of food I order, which cause them make it wrong. I find it is quite off for them to request such. Then I have to point the menu saying what I am order (and I was pointing at the menu when I ordered). Then the waiter smile afterward and say they will change for us. As if testing us.And we were talking, and once they saw dishes empty, their hand will come in and take it away. Like righ in the middle of two persons talking! And the urgency of want us to finish and get out.I wonder would I still want to go there, the food is just average. The service I am in sniffing mode. The only thing is the atmosphere. Like it‚Äôs a good location after all. :/ I hope you can improve better though
4
Three friends and I had a late Sunday lunch here. This is a regular spot as it's generally just so easy and the food is always lovely. Unfortunately (and this could be down to new staff) the service was frustrating. It was slow, they needed to be reminded we were there on several occasions and when asked if they would swap one spirit for another in a drink we received a flat 'no'!Such a shame - as mentioned, this is a regular go-to place but we may steer clear for a while
3
We ordered the wagyu beef (medium) burgers. Is not too bad. Didn't try other foods in the menu as it was a humid raining day, so we left after we have finished our meal. There's no aircon (is an open air restaurant), there are fans around though.
5
Despite being very crowded. Service was well taken care of. Staff were very friendly & approachable ! Bday cake was on the house as well! Was drizzling a little, they took the initiative to move us indoors. Their sticky date pudding is a must try!
4
Chose Prive for lunch whilst visiting the Chijmes. Nice bar and restaurant in a corner position with covered and outside seating. Friendly service, good food menu and plenty of drink options too. Food was good. Enjoyed it.
5
Had to take a break from walking...didnt know prive is also in chijmes.
Had drinks infront of the open area. The ambience is so relaxing.
Friendly staff as well!
4
A great outdoor venue with great food and excellent service. Great value for money and the menu has some hidden delights, take your time and enjoy sitting outside. Not to be missed. Enjoy.
5
Staff is helpful; realizing that table is lop sided, she came in to help to stabilize the table. Food portion is appropriate and the fish are fresh.
3
Nice ambience but went for lunch where the scorching hot sun is unbearable for me and my partner. Did a quick lunch and left, food was superb especially the beer battered fish and chips. Just that it could be crispier.
5
I'm very thankful to the restaurant crews who helped to arrange the birthday surprise for my friend. Truly appreciated their effort.
4
Good quality of food, drinks were half off before 8, pizza was good quality. Pastas there were good too.
2
Extremely rude server, was unwilling to serve and would stare at us rudely. Gossiped about us to her colleague as well
5
So we stumbled across Prive by accident. I was in Singapore for 48 hours and friend of mine had told us to go to Chijmes. If you try to find it it's hard! The whole complex looks like a church so don't be put off you've probably found it. It's a cool setting, a bunch of chilled out bars with a central grass area that usually has live music. Prive (which I did not realise until later) is a chain bar in Singapore, however you wouldn't know it, it gives off such cool vibes of being an independent bar. We sat outside on small tables and arrived at happy hour (which is actually 3 hours long!). All their drinks are 241 and it's about $6 a drink. If you want somewhere to start your night, highly recommend it, or even just to stay there for the evening, the live music and open air design will keep.you entertained all night. Service was swift and the drinks were good. Go and enjoy
4
Good food, good service, and excellent ambience for a night out with friends! Killer view of Chijmes too!
3
I would say this place can be an average place for dining. The atmosphere is good but the service people are either too busy to tend to you or they are relatively new at work.
5
Was there for late dinner and ordered bolognese and burger. Food tasted good.
Simple food done right!
Thank you Priv√® team
Keep up the good work
Sophie
5
Perfect brunch setting right here in Chijmes! I love the ambiance, feels, food and drinks! Would come back for sure.
4
We chose this place to meet friends who were on a quick stopover in Singapore and it was delightful. We sat upstairs in the bar area and were able to 'people watch' in lovely shaded area attended by a pleasant and accommodating your waiter.As the sun went down the lighting was very nice and the background music, for someone who wears hearing aids, was nice and did not drown out conversation.There was a nice selection of craft beers in addition to the regular brews and we never had to wait any length of time in being served. We did not use the dining rooms (and there are quite a few ranging across a large spectrum of cooking styles) settling instead for pizzas and fries to go with our beers and wines.There were a number of family groups so it accommodates for all sorts of customer groups. We decided that, as our daughter lives in Singapore, that we will certainly return as there are more places to eat and drink than this one I have reviewed
2
The restaurant is located in the centre of the very beautiful Chijmes. It is beautifully decorated. We ordered a salad and a main. Both were worse than average. Very dry and bad. I wouldnt recommend the food there but the atmosphere is good. Better go for the drinks
5
We had a lunch and a dinner here and both were equally good. Prive is al fresco with appropriate covering for sun and rain. The menu is modern European with a good mix of dishes.Foe lunch, the pizza and salad was very good and the dinner highlight was sea bass. You can also stop by just for a drink and watch the activity in the surrounding restaurants and recreation areas
5
We are regulars at Prive @ CHIMES. Delectable food and drinks; and 1st class service.Compliments to the Chef and team for the delicious food eg laksa, chicken rice, pizzas, pastas etc. Kudos to Tony, Katherine, Don, Jeremy, Brenda and Yuening for the 5 stars treatment whenever we are there. Compliments to Alan too for the wonderful margaritas, sangria, martinis. We will be back next week
3
We were at the National Gallery Singapore for an exhibition and we finished well after dinner. So we decided to go to Chijmes to chill and my friend suggested me this bar/restaurant. It serves alcohol/food and the ambience is nice and romantic if not for the very close table arrangements, we can hear other people's conversation either side of us clearly. It also doesn't help that the place was packed with people. How close am I sitting to the people next table? I can accidentally touch the people next to me if I am not careful enough.Food, so-so... we ordered the beef wagyu burger and pork burger.The menu are mostly western style food.There are wide selection of alcoholic beverages though.Prices are on the more expensive range.Honestly, this place is not so bad, but not one I would come over and over again
4
My husband and I stopped at Prive Chijmes for a much-needed cooling drink, having walked there from Clarke Quay on a very warm day, I felt like I was melting and was desperate for something cold! What a lovely little outdoor bar, set in the beautiful Chijmes courtyard, surrounded by the beautiful and historical buildings and convent chapel, a stunning location. Just so peaceful and relaxing, I was content to sit there people-watching whilst sipping on a Beijing Bellini cocktail. I was also very pleased with the service, our water glasses were frequently topped up, for which I was very grateful
4
Very chill n pleasant location for any gatherings , not advisable to bring children though. Great music !
5
One of my favourite places to chill out with friends. Love the alfresco setting and the happy hour deals. The food is good too!
3
It's very hot with limited sheltered seatings. Service and Food were mediocre and over priced. Will not go again.
4
Prive was a great place. I said it was my friends birthday and they gave a complimentsrybslick of cake and took a Polaroid of us and attached it in a gift card which was great!
5
Organized to have dinner with my boss from Japan. he enjoyed it. food was ok, service are good too..
thank you team.
4
Nice ambience good selection of food. Will meet up with friends there again next time.
However, due to the outdoor concept, it might be a spoilsport if rains come in the middle of dining.
5
Made a reservation for a birthday celebration in the restaurant. Food was good and my friends received 2 complimentary birthday cakes and birthday cards. Fantastic ambience for celebrations.
4
Nice food and pleasant environment for dining. Serving manners of waiters and waitress shall be improved.
2
I was there for brunch with a partner. I ordered a vegetable sandwich which turned out to be extremely disappointing. Firstly, the ingredients were absolutely pathetic! The vegetables were sliced so thinly, and were so sparse, there was barely anything there. Secondly, the bread was over-toasted to the point where one side was black ie burnt. Sandwich cost? $15. Too bad I can't upload pictures via this site, as I took pictures of the pathetic amount of vegetables and the burnt toast.
3
We have booked indoor and found out our seats taken. That made no difference in making reservations. After lodge complaints thankfully they agreed to arrange a preferred seats to us. To be fair, the food is good. The quick recovery of the service can be improved
5
Priv√© serves great food and the ambience is fantastic, especially on Friday nights when you'll get to enjoy some live music too. However, the place can get quite hot on hotter days and I'm not sure if shelter will be provided on rainy days.
5
Everything was so perfect! Staffs were very friendly. Especially, one of korean staff was very kind. That day, my friend was birthday. So, they provided some kinds of event. Thank you!
4
Good place to chill and have a drink during happy hour. Probably it would have been 5 stars if there are more food selection
4
The food is nice. Serve western and Asians. Waiters are cute and very attentive. Good place for meeting or birthday celebration.
5
An affordable casual restaurant. No air-conditioning. Good selection of western and local main course. The desserts are quite good. The outlet seems to be under-staffed.
5
Amazing place, very thoughtful team, excellent food, perfect for a birthday dinner with friends, i would totally recommend it
4
Reservations made for an anniversary celebration and oh boy, it was such a lovely dining experience with Prive Chijmes. First off, their customer service staff was really helpful. Thumbs up to Bendara who helped me secure a table on a busy Friday night. I think the text confirmation also added a nice touch to their service. Floor staffs were really friendly and attentive. They were also aware it was our anniversary and gave a complimentary cake and have our polaroid taken. The food were delish and reasonably priced. Our favourites were the Popcorn Shrimps starters, Wagyu Burger and the Sticky Date pudding dessert. The Salmon we had was average. Overall, I really enjoyed my dinner, the nice ambience, lights, good vibes accompanied with friendly staffs and live music. Thank you Prive group for making our anniversary a memorable one
4
I love this place. There are a lot of hanging lights and spaces around the restaurant. Live music (though a bit too loud from where we were sitting) was great. The food was great and we enjoyed the Happy Hour drinks. The staff, Don, was extremely attentive and prompt. We had a good time there
4
Food quality of Prive is always good and this is a great location with the charisma of Chijmes. Service was also really good. Only issue is that there is not enough seats that will keep you away from the sun or rain. Perfect for early mornings or evenings on a nice day.
3
My friend and I ordered a mediterranean salad each during lunch. On the menu the salad description looks delicious with a variety of ingredients. I asked for extra avocado on top. When our salads arrived, mine looked quite different from my friends' and as I start eating it, I realised it doesn't seem to have a lot of the ingredients i ordered! So I dig the to the bottom and still nothing! I called the waitress and asked her why the ingredients were missing and the explanation was - some of the ingredients (e.g. buckwheat) mentioned on the menu are not available hence not added to both the salads. I then pointed out that couple of the other ingredients were also missing (hummus, cashew, garlic chips), incidentally these had been added to the other salad. It is then that they checked with the kitchen and realised that the ingredients had indeed not been added. While they apologised and proceeded to add the ingredients, it just left a bad taste. First of all the salad is almost 20$ and then they forget to add half the ingredients! It is also possible that some people may not question the missing ingredients, in which case they would have been ripped off
4
Nice place to chill out! Always love the pan seared seabass, and you can't go wrong with the oreo mudpie as a dessert.
4
Good food and good service ! My friend and I love the outdoor seats and the ambience. Good place for chilled out and gathering.
4
Of course we hadn't been here before but we looked at the menu and decided to give it a try. Sure glad we did. The food was good and the service was great. We recommend it.
5
Booked this place to celebrate my friend bday. Nice place and great service. Requested for birthday cake but they do have complimentary for my friend. My gf love it as they capture a group photo for us and give it to her. Will visit again.
2
Food was disappointing. The drinks we wanted were not available. Food was heavy and not made with very much care.
4
The food list was quite extensive, it cover both local and western dishes such as Laksa or Steak +Wedges etc...I was happy with the Steak&Wedges as it was done to my request, medium-rare. My friend also liked her Seabass as well. The cocktail, Aperol Spritz, needs a little improvement on the serving, it could be served in a wine goblet rather than a long cocktail glass.The tables were packed close together (indoor seating) as the outdoor temperature was conducive for lunchtime, have you experienced lunchtime weather in Singapore??? hahahaha..
4
Chijmes houses many restaurants, so choosing one is difficult. We decided on this one and weren't disappointed. It isn't 5 star gourmet food, just average pub style meals which are affordable and western style. Great under cover but outdoor garden setting, and staff friendly and helpful. I'm sure there are many of these types places in Chijmes complex, but we tried this one and were satisfied.
4
Whenever my husband and I are at Chijmes, we always end up in Prive. We would browse the other restaurant menus but always decide to dine here :) The ambiance is fantastic and super chill, and most importantly the food is always excellent. I love the Field Mushrooms Madness pizza - I had this all to myself! (admittedly, my husband helped with a few slices). It tasted fresh and delicate, I would have kept eating if my stomach didn't get in the way...My husband loves to order the Pot Roasted Chicken Leg. I had a few bites of it, it really is delicious! Hearty, warm, comforting...So good!Will definitely be going back to try other stuff on the menu :
5
We have dined at this outlet of Prive a few times now, and always choose it because of it's beautiful ambiance. The garden setting with the strung up lights within Chijmes is absolutely lovely. I would highly recommend this restaurant to entertain out of town guests! The prices are mid-range (a bit lower than average for Chijmes) and the quality is good. Definitely don't miss the Happy Hour as well!
4
This is such a beautiful and relaxing place. It was a Friday night and it was crowded but we didn't feel cramped. There was live music in the centre of the lawn. The service was great. Food was slightly over average. My friend ordered the signature burger and he said it's just a normal burger. We enjoyed ourselves and will be back again, especially with the 50% off happy hour
2
Beers offered wasn't chilled, unfortunately the deserts were the best meal i had from a 3 course meal.
4
Nice outdoor setting at CHIJMES with plenty of seating. Very good happy hour running 5-8pm daily. Pop by for a drink before dinner.
1
The restaurant has great ambience but the main course is normal and very poor service. Definitely not worth for the price paid!
4
food and service is of great quality as usual but being in the outdoors, bugs are inevitable. a larvae looking insect was spotted on the menu; it was nerve wrecking. but the good thing is the good food took my mind off the rest.
4
Attentive service provided. Wide selection of food and good reviews on food quality was received from friends as well.
5
The waitress was kid for the kids, also had places for the kids to roll around, perfect for a sunny weekend brunch.
4
Onion rings were a tad oily. Salads were refreshing taste and came with some pomegranate seeds too! Seafood pizza taste was just right and not overwhelming with too much cheese. Overall good experience but the service need to improve as I think Prive was shorthanded on a weekend :
3
While the ambience was great , very relaxed setting within a garden setting, the service and food was nothing to rave about. Service staff were not proactive and could not make recommendations nor was there any attempt to understand our needs. Lunch Menu selection was nothing exciting and after a few minutes, we decided to leave and find alternative lunch venue. I guess it is more a brunch place and more suited for families with young kids who are free to run around in a safe environment while the parents dine and catch up with freinds
4
Was there with friends and quite a lovely place to dine in amidst lots of greenery. Gave us a holiday feel. Tried their wagyu beef roti john and the taste was really good! Though I couldn't really taste the beef and sambal due to the tomato and chilli sauces. Great dining experience nonetheless
5
Western dinner on the menu after lunch in Chinatown. Chijmes in general and Prive in particular was just the correct place. Solid menu, cosy atmosphere with lights in the trees and a toy castle to play in after desserts for our youngest. Just a great experience
4
Had a good breakfast at Prive. Chimes is always a great place for dining. Food was good but the toasted bread wasn't the best. Bacon was nice. French Toast was good but a bit too sweet for liking
4
It was unusually not busy. But good for us as the service was attentive üòä. It rained and so it was good we were sitting nearer the bar, well sheltered.
5
I really like to have a dinner at prive chijmes as the place is relaxing but not hot. The food also yummy and reasonable price.
3
location was great, nice play to chill and have a drink and some snacks. Mains were very underwhelming. I ordered a steak and it was about 1cm thick so there was no way they could cook it close to anywhere near what I asked for.
5
Definitely try this place. We went 3 times going back with friends for a get together the night before our wedding. The food is great, not bad prices and service is good.
5
this was one of the friendliest restaurants visited. the assistant manager - Katherine Dionisio - spent time with all the guests and happy to chat and explain everything she knew about the restaurant, the menu or anything else about Singapore. the food was really great and good menu selection - sharing plates no problem. the Chijmes area was once a church but fell into dereliction and was sold for reconstruction into numerous restaurants and some shops. Inexpensive and great value for everyone. cannot recommend this highly enough for anyone visiting Singapore
4
This is an al fresco dining cafe in CHIJMES overlooking the lawn and the old church converted to events hall. It's a bright weekend when I came here and is crowded with kids so expect them running around the entire place. It's very laid-back ambiance complements the setting of the lawn. Carrot cake and latte is affordable, though the coffee I got has a burnt taste on it (or maybe that's the blend the have on the beans) The place is crowded most of the time so it will take time to get the staff attention when you need them.
5
Was having birthday celebration at this pretty nice restaurant. Everything was so fine. The foods, music, ambience, service and etc. I rate 10/10 for it. Not forget to mention, then snapped a group pic of us with their Polaroid camera and attached the photo on a brithday card for me. Still I got a free mini cake from them. Everything was out of my expectation. The happy hour deals definitely worth your money as well where you get to sip the cocktails or whatever alcohol at an affordable price with such an awesome ambience living. A night chill at there is a must if you never been there.
3
The service was slow and they mixed our drinks up for a table of 7. Makes it difficult to cross drinks they mistakenly put in front of the wrong peeps when they already drank out of it. All would have been ok save they didn't offer to swap out the drinks
5
We had a lovely birthday celebration for a friend. Good food, good atmosphere (having lots of fans in the alfresco area helped), and we were all well taken care of by the team (especially Brenda). My friend loved the birthday card (and Polaroid photo), and we will be back again!! :
5
The aglio olio was simply amazing! The wine selection was great and very affordable too! Ambience was adding on to it.
5
Great setting at Chijmes! I had the steak frites which was delicious! Cooked just right with a wonderful sauce. The Oreo dessert was just as great. Overall a great experience!
4
Went here for sunday brunch and love it instantly. The ambience is very nice and the food also not bad. But service is a bit slow.

The services there was a let down. Food wise we're ok. However, though it was a Wednesday night, I kind of like the environment there.
4
Good basic menu, very popular for evening meals. Service good, food good. Price ok for Singapore. Will go back again
5
Good place for birthday celebration. Prive gave the birthday girl a complementary chocolate cake and even a birthday card with a Polaroid picture of us taken! Thank you Prive!
4
Food was nice and the ambiance of the place was good, especially in the evening where there is a light breeze without the scotching sun. Generally a good place to chill with good food and drinks.
4
First time here. Great place to hangout with friends for dinner and drinks. Will return again with my husband.
5
The staff was duty on 1 April was very admirable. During the course of my meal it began pouring heavily and I noticed how the staff had to carry the f&b with the umbrella. Formally from f&b industry, I thought the staff were deserving of a commendation. Thumbs up.
5
We came to the Chijmes outlet of Prive with a group of 10 people to celebrate my friend's birthday. I received a call ahead of time asking if we wanted inside or outside seating, we chose outside because the restaurant has a really lovely patio/garden area with lights strung up in the evenings. The service was very good the whole evening, the wait staff is plentiful and responded quickly to our requests. For the birthday celebration, the staff offered to hold the cake for us until the end of the meal to surprise the birthday girl. They took care of lighting the candles and bringing out the cake with an extra sparkler provided by the restaurant. The waiter took a polaroid and presented it to my friend with a card signed by some of the staff members. We didn't request this at all and it was a really wonderful touch to help make the evening extra special!The food here is good and average price for Chijmes (about $20-30/main). The Happy Hour is very long, it goes until 9pm and includes half price house wine, spirits, and 1/2 pint draught beers. The restaurant is spacious enough for a big group. I would highly recommend dining here for any sort of big group special occasion
5
Prive at chijmes was superb! Food was very good and atmosphere is even better! Overall a very nice experience
5
My friend enjoyed the birthday dinner and the surprise. .
Thanks prive chjmes for everything !! :):)
4
I like to have brunch at chijmes. Away from the crowd but near to the city hall mrt. Prive @ chijmes has the relaxing bench chair with cozy cushions to make U feel dining at home
4
The food was nice and the music was fun (80s-90s) and my boyfriend and I really enjoyed our evening.
4
the ambience and food were great! They serve a mixutre of Asian and Western offerings. There is a smoking area for patrons. Non-smokers may want to indicate sitting further away from the smoking area.
4
The setting is great in Chijmes Prive.
The food is also nice. I tried the eggs benedicte, and was happy with it. I must say that for the price, I would have expected a bigger portion. But that is the only thing I can remark.
5
The ambience of the place was really nice and romantic. Service was great too by the waiter who was patient and understanding.
4
Ordered the greenhouse salad which has promegranate, avocado, veg etc which makes a refreshing dish! The aglio olio has bacon bits which are surprisingly tasty. The mushroom pizza is passable; it would be better if more mushrooms are added. We also had 2 side dishes- popcorn prawns and onion rings & 2 beers and a camomile tea. At the price of $101, it's reasonable. It's certainly a wonderful and relaxed ambience at CHJIMES to enjoy the evening with BFFs
5
It's good to visit this place around afternoon between 2-4pm as this place gets crowded in the evening. The hickory barbeque ribs is to-die-for and serving size is generous. My latte tastes like burnt coffee beans but I think it's the coffee blend they're using which tastes the same in my past visits. Seafood pizza is delicious though the crust is dry. Love to sit at the bar counter though the air conditioning duct drips above me. Though not all, cheerful staff.
3
We've been here a few times now, lured in by the prime location within Chijmes, but quite frankly the food just really isn't great. Sure, you can get a basic burger done OK but the pasta is generally unimpressive and the pizzas are terrible; like a biscuit with toppings. Better for drinks than dining.
4
Very good experience holding a party here. Accommodating and helpful staff! Kids were welcome and had fun on the lawn right outside the cafe.
4
Great alfresco setting for an intimate gathering or large group. Though it might no be too comfortable if the weather is veey humid and hot. Pot roast chicken was good too.
5
Love the ambience there! Great place to bring your partner out. Service was excellent and the food was great! Would highly recommend it!
5
Wonderful food, great chill service and the perfect location for pretty much anything -- a date, family dinner, friends catching up.
4
Service was prompt, food was good. Weather was cooling hence a perfect choice. May get warm if the weather isn't as cooling. Good spread of food and nice ambience. Recommended for group outings!
4
I met a friend for brunch during the CNY weekend and because the weather was cool, open air dining was quite pleasant. We shared the Ultimate Signature Breakfast with 2 eggs (poached for us), chicken frankfurter, bacon, roasted tomato, sauteed mushrooms, rosti and wholemeal toast as well as the Pulled Pork knuckle panini with BBQ sauce, red cabbage slaw and served with fries. We both had a taste of everything in the signature breakfast and I imagine it would have been just nice for 1 person with a healthy appetite. Everything on the dish was alright and the dishes complemented each other. The pulled pork panini was a bit too sweet for my taste but I liked that the pork was very tender. There was a generous amount of pork that it tended to pop out with every bite so it's a bit messy to eat. The fries were crispy and stayed that way throughout the meal. For dessert we had the Oreo mudpie - the affogato swirl ice cream was quite yummy and both the vanilla and valrhona chocolate sauce just nice, not too sweet. We spent $63 for the meal so it was slightly on the high side but considering the venue and all, I expect it would be about the same in similar establishments
4
It was my 2nd visit. The restaurant was packed and luckily we made a reservation earlier on. The food was great and there was happy hour for the drinks. Most of the staffs were friendly except for a few though. And even though we had made booking but the table given to us was a small one meant for 2 person and we had 3 even though 1 is a child. It was not big enough for our drinks and the plates at all. But luckily, we managed to change to a slightly bigger table. Overall we are happy and eapecially by the service of one of the male staff who made an efooet to help us celebrate my husband's birthday. We appreciated it
4
We enjoyed the local food in Singapore but it was good to find Prive in Chijmes and enjoy some food that we'd find in Sydney. Chijmes stands for Church of the Holy Infant Jesus, which I believe was a refuge for children in the past. It is now a venue, mainly for restaurants, and it is amazingly bright and wonderful at night. It has to be seen to be appreciated and fortunately it's very well-located.It's important to determine the hour/s of Happy Hour as drinks are expensive in Singapore and we were able to enjoy a glass of wine for AU$14 - half price! The food isn't as expensive and there's a great choice here
4
HAPPY With.....1. Excellent Ambience - Al Fresco dining was very good.2. Friendly Staff - Friendly & Attentive.3. Instead of our usual Egg Ben, we had the Royale and it was wonderful. Sticky Date PanCakes - Yummy but the Pancake could have been warmer. Coconut Waffles - Delicious, would be even better with more coconut shavings and a little more fruits Caf√É¬© Latte - We felt that it was a little too bitter Mango Tango - YummyAreas for IMPROVEMENT-1. Limited Brunch Menu - Could have added Muesli related dishes for b'fast and a bigger Continental selection2. Had the Fresh Fruit salad but was disappointing especially for $10 an order.3. Music was too loud - Would be Perfect if it was a couple of notch lower in volume
5
Really good ambience - choice of alfresco vs. indoor. Staff is very responsive & food came very quickly for a Sunday lunch !! The menu had great variety - and the food tasted great... Prices were reasonable too given the location. Will make this a regular !
4
Staffs are friendly and helpful. Very nice ambience with good music. Perfect for family outing and friend gathering.
5
Prive is a great place serving both western and asian food. Great for couple, family or friends to get-together and enjoy the great food. Portion of food is decent.
5
The food was nice and the service was good. Only problem was that the venue is subjected to noise from events held at the courtyard so you'll just have to bear with it if it happens.
4
Food and drinks were decent. Price is reasonable. Nice ambience for Sunday (or any day) brunch out in the sun.
4
Great evening with great desserts and food. Some food taste pretty peculiar but overall presentation is great. Friendly service. Was seated outdoors and staffs were prompt to react when the rain approached. Still a fun dining experience
3
great atmosphere for a gathering. service is prompt. food is average. drinks not so good. may come back again to try more variety.
5
Great service and food was good too. Enjoyable day. In a ration, the service was better than price.. but the food was good. We would go back.
4
Our first visit in this place was lunch time, there's not much people and the place is like a normal restaurant in Singapore. But, it is different on our 2nd visit. We booked for dinner and to my amaze it looks different from what I expected. The place is so cozy, so romantic and I really love it. It's look like a bar at night but classic and even though we're not drinking we still enjoy the night. The taste of food is good and the price is reasonable. There a variety of food to choose from, pizza , pasta , meat , salad etc. Can recommend to friends.
3
Ordered Eggs Benedict and Pancakes for Sunday Brunch.Eggs Benedict were average tasting, nothing spectacular, costed about $17Pancakes however, were a major disappointment. It costed $14 for two pancakes and some maple syrup!! :( Service staff were very prompt and friendly and i really like the laidback chillax ambience the restaurant had.
4
I believe this Prive location is superior to all of the rest due to its location in the beautiful Chijmes. Although I normally view restaurants in Chijmes to be overpriced and not a good value for money, Prive has a reasonably priced menu with good food. The brunch selection is a bit small with only 3 savory and 3 sweet options, all of the savory options being egg based. There are a number of main course items available, but you can only order these after 11:30am. The one other downside to our experience was that the juice machine was broken and we were limited to just orange juice and smoothies.The biggest reason I enjoy brunch at this Prive location though is the setting. The outdoor patio has many plants and wooden tables, giving it a charming garden-like feel. Combined with the ambiance of the Chijmes complex, the setting is peaceful and enjoyable for a weekend brunch. I would recommend bringing tourists/visitors to Singapore here!
5
We've enjoyed the nice atmosphere there very much. The young guy who served is very polite too.
Will definitely visit this place again.
4
nice ambience and good service. price range $30-40 per pax for a sandwich and drink. Worth a try for gathering üòä
4
The staff was very friendly and the service was very good. They keep refilling our water and even checked if we were satisfied with the food!
5
Loved the atmosphere at CHIMJES Priv√©, choose a table outside! Food's a little pricey but it was flavourful and satisfying!
4
Priv√© at Chijmes is in a lovely spot - overlooking the green courtyard of the Chijmes complex (indoor or outdoor). Food is lovely, attention to detail!
4
Stopped by after a morning stroll into this place by noon.
Great atmosphere. By the church.
Good food. Good people.
Enjoyed it.
Came back again on the evening to enjoy the weather . Love the energy.
5
Wonderful service from the management and crew. Thank you for hosting the memorable surprise dinner for my fianc√É¬©e birthday. We had left and a staff ran to inform us that our cake was left with them. Thereafter, i had tried to request for forks to share the cake after leaving and the manager personally provided them to me with a handful of serviettes! Kudos!
3
Across the street from Raffles Hotel and near St. Andrews- spent a pleasant morning walking around the area and stopped in for a quick lunch. The atmosphere was nice, food was fine but I liked the vibe in the inner courtyard. The inner court at Chijmes is beautiful! If you don't stop to eat, at least walk through and take pics of old convent.
4
My kid loved the place. Not too crowded, had a kids meal with lots of options and they gave her a big box of colour pencils and worksheets to colour. The dessert (Vanilla ice cream) was good with real vanilla beans inside. The weather was good so she also had a good time running around the courtyard. Servings were huge and if you're a small eater 2 adults can probably share a main and dessert.
3
Nice food, great ambience, friendly staff, service could be better. We have appointment and arrived on time at 2pm, weekday. Lunch time was passed, some of the table haven't be clean, we was be seated at a table which haven't ready. After order, our meal was served quite fast. When my friend ask for warm water, staff was busy. There were only 2-3 staff, so we need to go to cashier/bar counter to ask anything that we need
1
Terrible service. Staff us no clue and have no expertise in English. It's was a bad choice on a special day.
4
Good selection of food from local to international. Service is rather prompt and attentive. I love the ambience as the whole place looks cosy.
3
The menu is just find, nothing fancy, just decent. But the ambiance is worth going for. We enjoyed the crowd and the beautiful setting of Chijmes.
4
We were the first table to arrive at 11am on a Sunday. The omelette with toast was delicious. The waffle was quite a small portion but tasty. Too bad the area wasn't busy since chijmes is beautiful.
5
Customer service was great and the atmosphere was really good. My date totally love it, we bothhad an awesome time! Looking for more to come. Thank you so much.
5
Tried their miso cod burger and sticky pork ribs. Both well done. Had a happy hour drink too. Great ambience by the CHIJMES lawn.
4
Food and drinks were slightly high cost, but the portion is big enough and it really nice. Love the ultimate breakfast!
1
Been to this place for third time now but the service is still very poor. The staff at night just doesn't care, that lady was very rude. Other staff are just rushing to get the bill and close the restaurant and treating the customer badly. I don't recommend them if you want to have a relaxing night, you will only get stressed by the rude staff. 3rd time is enough. Me and my friends couldn't take it anymore. Improvement is a must
4
Place is quite pricey but the food is really good! My daughter got the rib eye steak, I got the pasta, my wife also got the pasta, then we had a pizza with truffle oil and arugula to go with our wineNicely curated wine selection..
4
came for late lunch via the chope x visa deal and was quite interested to try their snapper pie (not many restaurants offer this dish!) was hoping for a slightly pie-crusty crust but the filo-pastry was pretty tasty in combination with the rest of the dish. the sauce wasn't too creamy (to my liking!) and flavourful having been cooked with the snapper, onions, veggies, potatoes and whatever other herbs lurking in the delicious soupy sauce. licked up every drop! nice mesclun on the side (would have been nice to have some tomatoes perhaps thrown in but that's just personal preference). otherwise was great service! the staff did warn me that the pie would take about 20mins to make and it came in just under! being greedy, i had to opt for a little dessert and decided to give their carrot cake a try. not bad! had a lovely balanced flavour for me (heard that some people thought it was too dense). probably this occured as the cake warmed up and the butter within started to melt? unfortunately i am not a cream cheese fan so scraped away most of the frosting. but the fruits and compote that accompanied the cake were great! especially the compote - wish there had been more!overall a lovely experience, good staff, decent food at decent prices in a lovely setting.
3
wished there could be more selections for breakfas menu. great place with lush greenery in a courtyard setting. staff are attentive and helpful.
5
Beautiful ambience .. large portions and excellent taste. We tried this on a rainy Tuesday evening. The deck was lit up with beautiful garden lights. Would definitely come back.
4
Good dining experience over at Prive for our anniversary lunch. My boyfriend also agreed that the service by the staff was good.
4
Went there for lunch. Food was good. Portion was generous. Staffs were attentive and nice. Small downside is that it's not that crowded so you don't feel that lively during lunch.
5
breakfast menu in the weekend is fantastic. do try their eggs benedict which goes really well with smoked salmon. the rosti is the best.
5
Love the bites... especially onion rings. Best one I ever tried. Ambience is romantic and relaxing, located at beautiful chijmes. Although on the expensive side, but great experience will make me go back again.
4
Definitely Prive Chijmes an awesome place to bring someone here for a date, the ambience and service of the staff are excellent and would recommend this place for a chill evening night out.
4
Chijmes is a really very nice place which I've always gone for years. Relaxing in the morning, happening at night. Priv√© is just beside the courtyard so it's really nice, having breakfast, looking at the greenery... a lot of parents bring their kids here to as there is lots of space to run around. And I like it that it's easy to get seats - as Priv√© is quite famous, I thought it would be very crowded, but I guess it's because they recently opened many outlets.I like the Chijmes outlet. Will definitely visit the new Orchard one for drinks when it opens

Visited Chijmes for happy hour and an early supper on a Wednesday evening. The ambience and setting was lovely - we were sat outside and were fortunate to enjoy quite a comfortable, balmy evening with clear skies, however I can imagine that it might get a bit warm/humid if you aren't lucky with the weather. All three of our group tried out the mojitos and selected sangrias, which were a reasonable SGD12 during Happy Hour. I enjoyed my selections of both the Mango Mint Mojitos (a sweeter one) and the Pineapple Ginger Mojito (quite sour and zesty, which I enjoyed). The food was unfortunately a hit-and-miss situation. My friend had the vodka-cream salmon spaghetti - the sauce was rather tasty, but it seemed as though the pasta was just a little overcooked. On the opposite side of the spectrum, the base of my mushroom pizza was rather pallid. It wasn't undercooked, but since they clearly hadn't cooked the base enough to acquire more flavour it was a bit bland. It was a shame though, as the mushroom topping was quite tasty and the egg was poached perfectly - if they had just been patient and left it in the pizza oven for another 5 or 10 minutes, it would have been a different story. Still, drinks and ambience were good so would definitely consider coming back just for that. Might take a miss on the food though. Our second drinks were rather slow, but our waiter was good and noticed, so was proactive in following up with the bar and coming over to apologise for the delay
4
Decent place to chill for a drink, outdoor can be slightly humid and hot on a Sunday afternoon. The mud pie Oreo was good and cucumber mojito was refreshing. Evening is definitely a better time to hangout here.Attended a lunch reception wedding at chjmes and needed a place to continue chilling.
3
Food was ok, value for money could be better. Outdoor was rather hot despite the fan but that's due to humidity. Otherwise would still visit again.
4
Great location and ambiance. Delicious drinks though very expensive-- overall a good experience. Good service
5
Cajun Burger was awesome and exquisite! Candelight dinner date with my baby, had loads of fun. Price of food was a little high, but the quality of the foods made it value for money.
3
The place is pleasant at night for happy hour, drinks are ok. Food is expensive for the quantity you get and not the best.
4
it was around 11 when we came and left with few seating option with direct sunlight. didn't mind getting tan so it wasn't that bad. food was okay, just average brunch menu. love the atmosphere, relaxing. enjoying brunch and having great family time
4
Lovely venue for some casual catch ups. They used to have indoor seating which they have now switched to all alfresco. Given the weather in the afternoon; it's still more comfortable to dine with air condition.
4
We have returned to this courtyard on every visit to Singapore, a relaxed location close to the hassle and bustle of the city. We sat looking at the church, drinking Singapore slings in the heat of the afternoon....good range of food to explore another day!
5
Restaurant staff were very friendly and accommodating! Dinner plans turned out to be an unexpected birthday celebration, Prive staff snapped a polaroid of the group, and gave it to us in a card ~ very thoughtful gesture from the restaurant :) On to the meal - excellent food and drinks! Everything just blended in very well :)Thanks again for a great experience
5
Just reviewed chijmes before I see this listing. I had a beer here in the evening in a nice table right next to trees. Really nice to have beer here after one day of walk in the city. Relaxing and pleasant. If you come to chijmes, try it
3
Not bad. Service was pretty good, food was okay nothing to shout about though. Was a little bit to much like pub food for me. Plenty of restaurants in this area so you would like to think the competitiveness would be like game on......think that got overlooked here I'm afraid
4
Good casual dining. Food was good, server was excellent. Nice place for a quick dinner... Chijmes is a very pleasant location.
4
Enjoyed the relaxed atmosphere with a good ambience, brief to the church and sitting on high chairs... Lots of people on a regular Thursday evening... Just had a few drinks and shared a pizza but can clearly be recommended...
3
it was hazy but to our dismay, glass panels all wide open. came specially for the food so no choice, had our meal and quickly left.
4
We went for drinks only, but the venue was really cute, nice quiet place for meeting friends or for couples.
The staff were welcoming and the price was reasonable. Area overall was lovely
4
This restaurant has a nice menu with salads, burgers, meats etc. so choice for everyone. The service was really good, the waiter was very professional. We could dit outside, enjoy the evening, so we had a nice time.
4
Seated upon arrival, no booking, friendly waitress, happy hour prices for beer and wine. Food although nothing special was adequate, Pizza Pork knuckle sliders. Atmosphere good and plenty of bars to choose.
2
What a disappointment, I ordered the 'Signature Hamburger', at $27 mind you, but not all the grease that came with it! Maybe we had to pay for the grease. Lovely setting but with all the wonderful restaurants in Singapore we had to choose this one, a wasted night
4
Great place in the heart of Singapore to have a quick bite or a more relaxed lengthy lunch.Staff are friendly and efficient and food is tasty and not too expensive, We had a Caesar salad with a side of french fries and truffle mayo (actual grated truffle mixed into a creamy mayo)Set in modern surroundings, clean and welcoming√¢‚Ç¨¬¶ defiantly a place to visit if you are in that area of the city
5
It's been many years I am visiting singapore , and this was the first time we went to explore Chijmes, so impressive , so historic, amazing environment, amazing dining options ,We chose to visit prive and loved the experience , it was a busy evening for the restaurant , we initially hesitated thinking that service might be slow in business and we might have to wait . Instead the experience was just great , as soon as we reached outside the restaurat_ one of the waiter approached with smiling face and offered a table for us . As the hostess was busy he assisted us in seating and took our order for drinks . the menu selection was great and we chose to start the evening with cocktail selections - presentation was nice and we tried other drinks too . Overall our evening was made with smile and care we recieved from the waiter and then from the hostess . food was ok but we expected to be little more flavourful but that didn't spoiled our experience , Would highly recommend to my friends and family to visit Prive - great location , great staff, great selection of drinks !! GOOD luck guys !! Keep up the good work! !
3
I went there twice, the atmosphere was nice and kinda romantic. First time, I went there for drink and the staff quit helpful that's why I came again for the second visit and bring my bf for dinner, but I disappointed as we sat there for more than 20 minutes and nobody came to give the menu. If the resto was busy I could understand but at that time I saw 2 waitress standing freely and I tried to wave but nobody noticed. We were starving and fed up so we walked out and still nobody 's bother, so we sat in other resto
4
Visited a couple of times already. Very enjoyable restaurant! Good price/quality balance. One time they were fully booked, but made an effort to help us get a table.
4
The service is very nice and the environnment outside is quiet (lunch time). This is a nice break during a shopping day. The choice of beers and cocktails is large. Typical food is burgers/ pizzas which are well cooked but standard.
4
I originally reserved other restaurants at Chijmes, but so many other places were super empty except Prive, so we went to Prive instead. This place got super packed, and it was very lively. They just came with new menu chili crab spaghetti which was absolutely delicious. Their duck salad and tuna salad were also pretty good. I ordered the rib with fries for my toddler, which was not as good and little spicy. I wish I just ordered their kid menu for my little one. Their peach sangria was alright. Overall, the portion was little smaller than expected, but food quality and service was decent. Highly recommend the place!
5
We ate here on 2 consecutive nights as the food was excellent, well-priced (for Singapore) with a good buzz about the place. The seabass was large, well cooked and presented and the choices of beer were small but unusual with Happy Hour expiring at 8pm. The staff were knowledgeable and friendly. The highlight, of course, of this and all the other restaurants in this setting is the wonderful floodlit ex Convent of the Holy Infant Jesus from which Chijmes is named, which is open to view. A must visit
1
Space is really lovely and it's such a shame as this could be a really lovely brunch place. Music was loud when we arrived, felt like a club with pumping music. After we asked for it to be turned down, they turned it up... Took several other tables to inform them before they realised... Out of 6 dishes, my pasta arrived first, sitting there going cold for another 10 mins before the other dishes arrived. By the time I ate it, it was soggy and lukewarm. After asking the waiter to fill up the cutlery cup as there wasn't enough napkins, he pointed to another and told us to use that instead. When I asked if he was sure it was enough for all of us, he responded"I don't know..." rather than getting more...
2
Poor service, inflexible and untrained. Asked for a quieter seat as there was a huge gathering going on, but staff didnt know how to sort that out.Elderly dad requested to change the salad side to fries but they couldn't do it. So we ordered a portion of fries separately, which came way before the main courses arrived. Overall, it seems like the staff were only told to do steps A - Z strictly by the books and were not able to accomodate to any minor changes - given this is a modern day restaurant, it's very surprising.Probably wont return here again. Much better places to visit - highlander restaurant is a stone throw away with much better service
4
We had our gathering at Prive@ Chimes. Mr. Jackson from Prive@Chimes was personal and helpful. Despite the business running full house at cafe that night, the service was excellent! the finger foods were good. Happy place for chill out. Keep up the good service and nice food. Highly recommended place and will go again
4
Nice place to sit back and relaxed on a sunny day under the fans, have some beers, cocktails or even some yummy sangria!The food was very nice, plenty of options on the menu. The staff can be sometimes hard to find and you can be left waving your hands to get there attention, and i noticed i wasn't the only one having to do this to get served at times.Good food, cold beer, right on Orchard street. Great
4
Service was fanastic . Lead by an Assistant Manager that is setting the correct example and attitude to the team.Happy Hour promotion for half pints before 8 pm. Nice little section with lotsa fans outdoors to keep customers chilled and happy.Will recommend guests for certain
3
This was our first visit to this outlet after the renovation works at Chijmes, although this place was formerly occupied by a different restaurant. The place has a nice ambient with various tables (high and low) and is located in the courtyard at the ground level of Chijmes.We started drinking a glass of Red Sangria, that tasted more like a fruit punch, and a Iced Apple Tea. We had then a Croque Monsieur and a Pizza Margherita. In both cases we have been pretty disappointed as we felt we were having a TV dinner. We had better luck with the Signature Burger and the Seafood Laksa that clearly showed the capability of the chef to handle the local cuisine in a more decent way.Our disappointment was partially compensated by the punctual and attentive service; a bright light in an otherwise dark evening. Price was within our expectations (SGD 118.30). It is probably a good place to hang out if you just feel like having a bottled beer has they have happy hour deals, but please avoid the food
4
Enjoyed our meal at Prive Chijmes, fantastic setting, mainly all outdoors!! Can highly recommend the burgers! Amazing Angus Beef Patties!
5
Beautiful location, awesome menu impeccable service, not to be missed when in Singapore especially the intensely iced latte and oreo mud cakeüòç
4
Good value pub food in great courtyard location which is very lively and good atmosphere. Food was also good and happy hour.
4
We dined outside The service was good Food was excellent Wine & beer more expensive than most adjacent restaurantsIt was still far busier than any other restaurant so I guess that indicates that they don't need to discount alchoholReasonable range of choice in menuPrices reasonable for the standard of foodWe're not open for lunch or we would have dined there againStrongly reccommen
3
Let's cut to the chase: we had a large booking and there were no enough seats and in a very tight space of the restaurant - not a good start! Other downside: ac vent was leaking and this was cleaned while we were eating our meals. To be fair despite the rocky start it all ended well with v good service from one of the waiters and a nice bouncy castle play area for kids. Menu was varied and had kids meal options. Food was decent with good portions. Recommend for small dinner party with kids but probably not ideal for large group. Good location if in the raffles city/ place area.
4
My singaporean friend brought me there and it was great. The spacing between tables are just right therefore it wasn't very noisy. There was sufficient amount of fans around the restaurant so it wasn't that warm as well. Only thing that needed improvement was that there was insufficient amount of staff working. They were nice and friendly however I pity them rushing around serving people while sweating all over. Hire more staff guys... Don't work your staff to death..
5
Staff patiently waited on us and gave suggestion on what to order. Very helpful and polite even though my son spilled some water on the table. They quickly came with some napkins and offered to refill the water. Food was good and came quickly after you ordered
4
Visited on a weekday for dinner, with a group of 10. Nice atmosphere and popular with tourists. Quite a large choice on the menu eg fish & chips, pasta etc.portions were surprisingly generous. Service was good, we didn't have to wait long for our meals or drinks, enjoyed happy hour drinks
5
We had a group of eight for lunch yesterday and enjoyed the variety of dishes. Some of us chose from the breakfast options, others had sandwiches, salads, and pasta. Everyone enjoyed their meal; one person had a very large sandwich (croque monsieur) and the staff cheerfully packed her leftover half to go. I found the service quite attentive by Singapore standards. Although we had water carafes on the table from which we could serve ourselves, the waitress was very quick about refilling our water glasses. Also they provided our party with separate checks which was greatly appreciated. We experienced no service delays described by other reviewers. Chijmes is such a lovely setting, but we took a table indoors as it was a pretty warm day

Fancying a coffee 5 of us came across this restaurant it looked inviting so we were seated, given a menu and after approximately 10 minutes our order was taken , we then proceeded to wait 20 more minutes for our coffees.  Other people arrived and were served and it seemed to me if you wanted beer you were served immediately if coffee another thing , well we waited eventually what looked like a manager said he would go and sort it , he did but to wait over 30 minutes for coffee , I will not return and we were not the only people to complain . Why we waited I don't know maybe it was the heat and we were thirsty

Ordinary food, poor service and high prices.We had a group of four and were told at one point that 'these drinks will take about 25 minutes at the moment'. That was for 2 wines and two beers. We explained that that was simply unacceptable and they 'only' took fifteen minutes. Which was about twelve minutes after try delivered our food.With all the competition in Chijmes, surely they won't last long with service like that. The quality of the food certainly didn't make up for it.Go elsewhere

To be found in the upmarket CHIJMES complex which is found at Victoria Street, Bras Basah Road and North Bridge Road. The redevelopment of what was an orphanage, convent and Catholic church on a large tract of land close to the CBD is impressive. On weekends the cars in the carpark are all top end so this is a place to be and to be seen.A good variety of restaurants can be found here including a number of what are successful chains such as Prive.We stopped in for a quick lunch and a beer. It was happy hour (like it seems to be in many places across the city) which is a way of getting prices somewhere into the expensive rather than super expensive range. At Prive this meant a discount of $1 per 1/2 pint.We ordered an Asian roast beef salad which appeared as a few slices of finely cut roast beef on a dressed leaf salad - no mint or no coriander. When asked to dress the salad with these herbs the plate returned with a pile of unmixed mint and coriander. Not overly good Chef..

An 'open plan' type restaurant in in a 'posh food court'. We both thought the menu was a bit restricted and the offerings sounded a bit elaborate but when it arrived it was just a steak and chip and it was quiet tasty if a bit pricey. The place was quiet busy but we were shown to a table quickly and the service was attentive and the food arrived without too long a wait

First time visit to this cafe. found this cafe via chope and make a reservation to avoid disappointment. We have a pleasant time at here. It was raining during our visit and outdoor seating eaters are moved to the indoor. Foods are good and big portion. Price is reasonable. Will recommend it to others

This is a really lovely setting for outdoor dining and usually attracts a nice buzz of people. I had a pizza and it was really good, thin crust, nice proportions of topping. The menu is good, although not a lot of light options. However all of this is overshadowed by the WORST service ever. Not even rude service, just completely inept and hopeless. They only succeed in avoiding the glares, calls and waves for service from their frustrated customers. Getting a drink here is a challenge. I am not too particular for service in casual dining places, but the service here is so notably terrible I had to write this

A friend of mine and I went to this restaurant for dinner on a fairly busy Thursday evening.The place looks nice during the day, but looks even better at night. Service was OK. Food was not bad and also not very expensive. One can't say the same of the wine .... very expensive .. The wine was about 60 % of the total bill with food for two people. You don't want to get drunken there ... it would cost you a fortune!! Ha-ha-ha

Given that Prive is a chain, the menu, price and food quality of this location is comparable to the other locations. What is worth nothing is that the atmosphere in the Chijimes is fantastic. However, the service at this location is just awful. We were here for dinner on a weekday. My partner and I ordered our food at the same time, yet our main courses showed up a full 40 MINUTES apart. At no time did the wait staff come and check on us or give us an explanation or update on the second main course. Half hour after the first main course showed up, we finally waved a waiter down and asked him to follow up, he didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t even bother to come back and report back. When the food finally arrived, there were no acknowledgement or explanation whatsoever

20 minutes ago we were at Prive restaurant for dinner. This is a nice place in Chijmes, with so-so food, but this is not the problem.The problem is that, after finishing our meal, a waiter came to ask if we want to order something more. We reply politely no, thanks. Then she said: other clients have arrived, they have reserved a table, so she wanted to move us to another table in the back of the restaurant.I think this is not acceptable! We asked for our bill and leave. They did not apologize or even say good bye.If you want to avoid rude service, do not go there

We went here for an afternoon drink. I ordered a Prosecco which came with no bubbles whatsoever. When I asked for a fresh one I was told it was semi sparkling and from a new bottle so there was nothing they could do. 5 minutes later someone on the next table to me got a glass which was extremely fizzy. We also ordered a double espresso and only a single came. Staff didn't really seem interested at all

We looked for a burger in that neighbourhood and decided to give Prive a chance. It looked nice and it was open. Yes, we were not picky :) Decent selection of burgers and beer. The burgers were quite expensive around 25SGD, the beer also wasn't cheap even by Singapore's standards. Fortunately the burger was tasty, nothing spectacular, but almost worth the price. The beer was also very nice. Unfortunately we were ripped twice, despite happy hours we had to pay normal price for beer and our bill magically grew a few dollars for unknown reasons. Despite that I can say the place was nice, just be on your guard when paying the bill.

We had a late lunch -- panini and the chicken-bacon-avocado sandwich. Good quality food and a nice outdoors atmosphere with relaxed music and a calm environment. All in all pleasant for an outdoor relaxed meal.

Try the summer ale beer. S$ 7,00 happy hour price. Very good burgers: Signatures and Pork knuckle. Great service and ambient.

Initially our effort to secure a table on a Friday night was met with 'we're full', however we were advised to return about 20 mins later to try again. That gave us a change to nip to the 'Highlander' pub for a swift Singapore Sling to set us up. We returned to Prive and were seated, and were offered drinks and food menus. I was with 3 other business colleagues so the chat was lively, but it is still a little loud. Food was delivered quickly and of a good standard, the waiter was very professional and happy to engage in our banter. The restaurant is situated in an area called Chimjes, nice feel to the place and a larger number of places to eat and drink. The bill was approx √Ç¬£200 SGD which is what you would expect to pay in the tourist area. Recommended to those who want to be seen, nice restaurant and would give it another try

I'm unsure if the review of Prive@Keppel Bay should be included here because I couldn't find Prive@Keppel Bay in Trip Advisor. We have been to Prive several times but it was the first time we tried their milkshake and cakes. My milkshake came with BBQ mashmallow, more mashmallow in the drink itself, together with some chocolate bits & other crunchy stuff. What captivated me at FIRST sight was the design on my bottle and "Prive" that was on my partner's bottle. I wasn't sure if the design and word had been printed on the bottles. Only later we found out that they had been drawn/written on the interior of the bottles. The bottles of milkshake were FANTASTIC!!!We ordered salted caramel cake and it was equally delicious! A combination of sweet and salty taste

We have chosen this place because it seemed to be the most crowded (sign of a nice place hehe) and cozy restaurant in Chijmes. Glad we made this decision! Totally agree with other reviews that the ambiance is great out there.The food was absolutely delicious, signature burger, chicken sandwich and aoli pasta recommended. I would say prices are also pretty good, around S$ 18-30 for a meal.They have a huuuge variety of cocktails and beers, which is usually uncommon! As we couldn't decide on the beer, our waiter gave us to try four different ones. That was very sweet of him! Unfortunately, later service became very slow. But that wasn't big of a deal as we had a great time

It's a cool location, and the ambience is good. Food choice was somewhat limited especially for main courses and soups. While the food tasted good, the service was particularly bad for us. There were 3 of us. In my case they forgot the started and when alerted they delivered it about 15 minutes later. In my friends case they completely forgot his main course....and finally delivered it perhaps 20 mins late when the rest of us had finished. Have to say it spoiled our experience

A raining night Monday in Singapore why then go to a place where it's wonderful to eat when the weather is nice and you can sit outside. Well! Just because they have a great service and very nice food especially good value for money. I got this nice Caesar salat and a very well prepared ribeye. This is a place you always can go if you want to enjoy you evening dinner in singapore.

A group of four of us had dinner here which was a first for us. Two of us had steaks which although they asked for medium rare they were closer to medium and not the best cut. Service was very slow and inconsistent. The staff were fries my and helpful though. My meal came out ten minutes before the others... The drinks came after! It just seems there is no joined up way of working...

Dined here over dinner with a friend for my early birthday celebration before hitting another destination. Ambiance was spectacular. The food was very delicious especially their beef pie. We also ordered lobster pasta and non-alcoholic bevs for our drinks. The staff were courteous and quick to cater to all our requests. Enjoyed the atmosphere, the vibe, and the food. Price of the food justifies its taste. So, didn't bother paying a lot more than my usual meal. All in all, this restaurant is a must-try

We ate at Prive at Chijmes. Great service, delicious cocktails and fantastic burgers. Super location being set in a peaceful courtyard.

Liked the pancakes a lot. It was so mouth watering. Couldn't stop eating. We sat outside just by the river. View was fantastic with the wind blowing.

They served good breakfast. I ordered egg benedict and got a decent portion. The food was delicious and the marina view was not like Singapore, very much like holidaying in another country.

My office is near Chijmes but that place didnt really attract me to visit. What a great surprise! Priv√É¬© has pretty much everything I expect as a casual dining venue. Good service, good food, good selection of drinks and fantastic ambiance. Well deserved 5 Star. Btw, they also have limited cigar menu!!

We had an early Saturday evening dinner at Prive with friends and our kids. The restaurant is located in the courtyard of Chijmes, which is a great setting and gives the kids some space to run around. From the offset, the level of service was quite poor,although in fairness the staff were always friendly. However, the waitress forgot about our drinks order, the kids' food was served on adult plates despite kids plates being available. When the bill arrived, it was inexplicably divided unevenly in two. The menu offers mostly standard western dishes with some popular asian choices too, and has a good selection for kids in the form of a combination platter (eg main+dessert+drink). They also provide colouring-in materials to keep the kids occupied, nice touch.All of us adults opted for burgers, which were fine, if a little overpriced (SGD 25). For that price, even in Singapore, I would expect larger portions and better quality of fries than we received. In short, Prive is a good spot to bring the kids, although don't expect to be blown away by the food

Prive is located on the yards of Chijmes, which gives it a very relaxed and pleasant outdoor dining atmosphere. Food was mainly Western with a little bit of Asia on the menu. Had dinner with friends so the cool of the evening helps with the humidity in Singapore. Not sure how one would enjoy dining outdoors in hot and humid weather during the day! Because of this I'd give a 4-star rating. Waiting staff are attentive. Food is delicious. Drinks are not cheap but reasonable for the location. Would definitely come back the next time I hang out at Chijmes

This place - in the Chijimes restaurant complex, serves good food with a smile and we had no complaints whatsoever. However, there are so many good restuarants in Singapore that its difficult to mark this one out as being any better than the rest.It also gets very busy as the evening moves on, as does this entire restaurant complex, so if you want something quiet - eat earl

Nice little romantic restaurant/cafe in newly renovated Chijmes. Great location with a nice view. So much for the positive things. Service is slow and has no processes behind it. This seems to be the new normal in the Lion City. They have a great sound system and unfortunately put the volume up way too much with the wrong tunes. Staff loved the music, patrons hated it. I had the feeling they wanted to drive out customers, so that they could close on time. Paying took literally ages. I counted 7, they staff could not make this place work smoothly. To summarize: amazing hardware with subpar software.

I've been here twice and both times the service has been terrible. I've had forgotten meals, meals turning up at different times, wrong coffee orders and just a general lack of structure - it's really hurting this place. The cafe itself looks fantastic, location is great and the food is nice. If they can work on the service and going that extra step this place will be back on track

Spotted Prive the previous evening as we strolled round Chijmes and having read reviews on TA along with their own website we returned for breakfast when they opened at 1130 am the next morning.It was a very hot day in Singapore so we opted to sit inside for the air con...some nice seating outside with fans which is nice in the evening. Very good menu choices but we were there for the ultimate breakfast for me along with beans on toast for the wife.Excellent choice with bacon, sausage, two eggs, rosti, tomato, mushrooms and toast - refuelled and ready for a days sightseeing, great value for the food and hot drinks at $42...well recomende
