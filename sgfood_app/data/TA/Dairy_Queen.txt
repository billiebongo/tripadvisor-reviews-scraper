This place is closed now but they used to serve great icecreams and even hotdogs. Bulk of the crowd goes to Mustafa Market. So the mall does not get crowds.

A place for good ol' American treat and fast food. It is cheaper than in the US by 1/3 of the price. You have to try the blizzard special for each season.
