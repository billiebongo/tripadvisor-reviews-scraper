I was taken to Quentin's by a friend. We had a great dinner on the terrace al fresco. A live band was playing, and a cool breeze blowing. The food was delicious. The ambience was great. It couldn't have been better.
5
Good food, excellent service and on Friday and Saturday nights, live music of yester-years bring back an air of nostalgia and the good old time... that's why we kept on coming back!
4
Good yummy homecooked food and kids friendly! Great chill atmosphere. Would def return and try other dishes!
3
Nice environment.
Must try their dessert - durian ice cream cake and their macadamia nuts brownie with ice cream.
5
Had dinner with some friends. friendly service, lots of different varieties of Peranakan cuisine, much of which I've tasted for the first time. I recommend the prawn curry as well as the brinjal dish (can't remember the exact name)
5
everything we ordered was tasty. staff helpful. good service. fun play room for kids. i recommend the cod fishcakes for children.
4
We have always enjoyed the great food .... and the music played are all songs that we can sing along to.
Highly recommeneded
3
We ordered an oxtail soup that came cold (not even warm). Tasted more like a slightly sweet milk desert.Roasted pork had nice crunchy skin, but meat was dry.Devils curry tasted like a sausage and tomato flavored minestrone soup.The squid ink squid dish was blend. Insufficient "umami" flavor that should come from squid ink. More salty water than anything.Beef texture was nice although the gravy/sauce tasted like something from a can.The only redeeming dish was the corn beef fried rice and the fish chips served at the start
4
Googled for kid-friendly restaurants and this came up with stellar reviews, so we thought to give it a go, given that we wanted something different (Eurasian fare isn't common enough I reckon!) and because between our families, we had an almost-3yo, and a 7 and 9yo to entertain.Quentin's was easy to find, with ample parking and quiet and well-ventilated at 11am on a lazy Sunday morning. The first bowl of keropok and 2 different chillis were complimentary, and excellent for munching on while going through their menu. We asked for suggestions on their popular dishes and ended up ordering a fair bit. Popped the kids into their lovely playroom which was big enough and varied enough to entertain all 3 of them and we watched them from our table since it was a glass walled room with a baby gate. Seating was either in the well-ventilated "outdoor" area or indoors. We chose to sit outside, and didn't regret it.Food came promptly, was delish and quickly polished off. Had the prawn bostador amongst other things. Price was acceptable for the quality. Desserts weren't fabulous, but we weren't there for the dessert anyway, so that's ok. All in all a lovely place for a lazy Sunday brunch with old friends. I would go there again. Oh there's also a museum / Eurasian heritage centre in the same building which we wanted to check out, but didn't get a chance to, so we're likely to go back soon
4
Pure blondes on tap. The Wife and I, then girlfriend, liked it so much we decided to get Quentin's to do the catering for our wedding. The guests loved the food. One small unfortunate point was that on the day itself they set up and left the extra trays of food there with without communicating to the venue or ourselves that someone would have to refill the trays ourselves. Had to find out the hard way. Was pretty embarrassing to have guests help to take out large trays of food to top up the food warmers. Food was so tasty I'm willing to let all that slide and pretend it didn't happen ha ha.
4
Warm welcome, make you feels like home. Enjoyed the band very much. They played oldies.
Foods is good and the play area for the children is excellent.
4
Great atmosphere and food! Excellent for gathering of families and friends.
Neat play area to keep the younger ones entertained while the adults chat..
4
The price slightly higher, food taste is great. Environment is ok, there is a kids play room so we can enjoy our meals while kids can have fun in the kids room.
5
The food were great and unique. Environment was cosy and homely. It will be a great place for gathering.
4
Went to Quentin’s based on some good recommendations from peers and was pleasantly surprised at the intrinsic array of presented flavours! I would definitely recommend the oxtail soup, that was the winning dish for me!
4
Decent food, great play room, nice staff, relaxing atmosphere. Would definitely return again to try more of their food. Thank you!
5
Charming old world setting mixed with excellent service and some outstanding dishes. A band plays on week ends and was belting out some 60s and 70s hearthobs including some Beatles. Off the beaten track worth a visit. All dishes are Eurasian . Reasonably well stocked bar and choice of beers and wine
4
Had a friends & kids gathering and it was great as there was a private indoor play area suitable for the children 2-6 year olds. Food was quite good but not very suitable for young children and the kids meal is quite pricey.Service staff seemed a little overwhelmed as the restaurant was about 80% full for a Sunday lunch.Would still return on a less busy day
4
It was the first time we visited Quentin. We wanted to find a place where the kids can have some fun while the adults eat and chat.. We must have ordered like 10 different dishes, I must say the food is really good!! However, we waited quite long for the beer and food. There's a nice band singing through the night. The kids had fun, especially at the ball pit! But the toys are mostly not working or no battery.. Overall a good experience, will definitely visit again!
4
We had been to Quentin's on previous visits to Singapore and on this occasion took or expat daughter and husband who now live in Singapore - both are 'foodies' so they were useful food critics! This is casual restaurant in many senses - it is at the Eurasian Association building so is used by many members of the Assn - with a great children's play area and a relaxed feel. the food standard is however anything but casual and is of a very good standard. if you have not tried Eurasian cuisine before this is one of the few quality locations to try it out. Bar and food service are professional and helpful
4
Everything we ordered were delicious. This place is really packed during our visit which is on a saturday evening ( so make sure to make a reservation to avoid disappointment) . It definitely a lively place with good food and professional service from the team.
4
Staff were very polite and love the place and ambience. Enjoyed the music as it's much more lively now. Our last visit was 3 years ago when we celebrated my nephew's 21st birthday with my late brother.
5
Great atmosphere great food. Hidden gem in joo chiat area. Local, rustic, and heart warming food. Recommended for friends and family
4
Food is awesome, kids playroom is great for families. Very secure. My go to for hanging out with friends with kids
5
The kids love the play room in the restaurant. The food is also fantastic with a lot of spices, adding to the favours.
5
Excellent food, servings are just nice. I will go back for more choices. Great place for parents with kids
5
Everything we ordered was great and exceeded expecations. The deco was wonderful creating a good atmosphere as well as the live band. The only thing marring the whole experience for our couple night was being seated with 4 other family with screaming children with 2 birthday parties. We would have preferred to be move to the "adult areas" near the live band
5
Celebrated my wife's birthday at this restaurant last week. A laid back, no pretence restaurant at the Eurasian Association premises. The restaurant has an indoor and outdoor seating option and reservations are recommended.The food was awesome, would recommend the Roasted Porku and Prawn Bostador.They had a very nice quartet playing great live retro music
5
Celebrated my daughter's 15th birthday with a group of 12 on 25th Aug 2018. The food we ordered especially the Ox tail Devil was simply divine !! I give the food 10/10. Service can actually be more attentive, but hey, its informal dining, so no big deal..8/10. The live band was Brilliant..they made the difference !! Good old music from era gone by..10/10. Choice of in-door and outdoor sitting, but you don't feel the Singapore humility and heat...well fan !! 9/10. Ordered the Rainbow cake,it was was delicious but a little too sweet for me but the rest of the party enjoyed..thats what matters..9/10. * note : There is a cakeage charge of 10% for dinning in of the cake ordered and 20% for bringing you own cake..aiyah, bring in so lecheh...order and pay 10% ..its worth it !!
5
Quentins never disappoints especially with food. Just simply excellent. We tried the Fish bostador, porku tembreneu and fried okra. The portions were huge for a couple and could have easily fed 4 people. Delicious meal accompanied with brilliant live music totally befitting the wonderful Eurasian culture that mixes good food with good music for an amazing dining experience
4
It is an experience we had for our boys to celebrate their birthday at Quentin. WE enjoyed the most is the ambient of the place and the play room.
4
Great restaurant for families. Excellent dishes. Always have a great time and it's perfect for kids as it has a well equipped kids play room.
5
My friends and I really enjoyed the food. The band playing was also extremely professional. Service staff were lovely too. Thanks to all.
5
Good food to reminisce about the good old days. Service is great. Nice live music in the evenings. Kids playground is an added benefit for families with young children.
4
I really like Quentin's - it's fun and the food is delicious. I went two Saturdays in a row and the band recognised me, so did the uncle. The waiting time for the food is a bit long but the ambience and music more than make up for it
4
Had a gathering here with some local and overseas friends. Had buffet. The spread was awesome and the food was delicious! It was my 2nd time there! The kids could play in the play room while the adults dined in peace while able to keep an eye on them. My overseas friends loved the place too!:
5
Was welcomed by Staff after booked a Chope table, requested a table outside on veranda. iPad service, but it worked very well and staff were attentive and friendly. Ordered on the pad, food was with us promptly and delicious! Music was played by a small band, not too loud which was great as we wanted to chat. I recommend this place for a relaxed and friendly atmosphere, great spicy food. Wine list is not too bad either, nice New Zealand Sauvignon blanc.
2
Restaurant was severely understaffed. ipad self order taking was innovative unfortunately battery ran out before we cud submit the order and we had to repeat the entire process with the waiter again. We had to wait 20 minutes for people to show us to the table and give us a new ipad. And another 15 to 20 mins for food to be served. The carpark entrance and exit were very narrow. Perhaps they need to swap the exit and entrance around for a wider turning angle. I have also posted this on their facebook. Food was very disappointing and overpriced. Only highlight was the children's playroom which my daughter enjoyed
5
We had dinner on a Saturday night and was pleasantly surprised to see a live band performing evergreen hits. The place was crowded so good thing we had booked a table via the Chope app. Dishes are served family-style (read: sharing portions) so don't forget to leave some room for dessert
3
The food was great except that the turmeric cabbage was not as wonderful as the Oxtail curry, black ink squid and cod fish cutlets. The musicians were good, enthusiastic, playing many oldies but goodies. That means that this is not the place one goes to have good conversations as the music was far too loud. We couldn't stay for dessert. A big negative was that they condoned one of their customers smoking a pipe in the open-patio but within the non-smoking zone. Beware, the smoking zone is but one foot away from the non-smoking area. I thought smoking was not permitted except for several metres away from eating places? Hence the 3-star and not 4-star.
2
Understaffed, food was served in a irregular manner (one of my starters came mid way through the meal for example..). Band cancelled last minute (which was the whole point as to why I brought my guest here).
5
Very nice play area for the kid while adults enjoy the nice Eurasian food.
Food is nice although the iPad ordering system is kind of extraneous.
5
the waiting time was a bit long, but the food was great and the live band helps to create a good ambiance. food portion was very generous and delicious. will definitely visit again
5
Celebrated a birthday there and the whole experience was nothing short of Great Food and Great Music 👌👌👌
3
We ordered the famous Devilled Chicken Curry, Corned Beef Fried Rice and Chap Chye. Only the corned beef fried rice managed to impress with its strong 'wok hei'. The devilled chicken curry was passable but had some pork inside that were quite tough to chew. The chap chye smacked of too much garli every mouthful and had way too much radish and little else of dried beancurd, fungus and other vegetables.
5
An awesome restaurant with delicious mouth-watering curry stews and a great play area for young toddlers/babies to keep them occupied while the adults feast! The service staff were patient, prompt and also super friendly! The senior waitstaff kept coming over to feed my 2yo girl her rice, was such a cute moment! Lovely band on weekend during our meal, one of the best places to makan in SG in a relaxed cosy yet homely atmosphere
5
The ambiance in the indoor restaurant Eddie's place was exquisite and serene. The ipad menu was a great idea and was easy to handle with clear pictures of the food. The service staff was cordial, polite and warm. The most wonderful thing was their advise to order the right amount and true enough the dishes were just right for my table of 3
4
We don't go to Quentin's very often as we stay in the West but are always assured of consistently good meals when we do go. This time, we ordered these:kiam chye soup - Kiam chye could have been softer and soup could have been more sour; prawn and petai sambal - Very nice with big, crunchy prawns.pork ribs and long beans - A good dish though could have been more generous with the veg.corned beef fried rice - Tasty. Can't go wrong with corned beef!The servings are for a min. of 3 diners at least so we happily had leftovers to bring home!A point to note also. We were pleasantly surprised to find that there is now a public car park right next door to the Eurasian Association. It used to be such a hassle to find parking there
4
A must-go for anyone visiting Singapore and looking to savour flavourful dishes cooked with Asian spices. The best thing is that it is not too spicy which makes it wonderfully accessible for most tastebuds that do not take well to hot spicy flavours.Our family came by on a Sunday evening at 645pm and it had a healthy dinner crowd. It has a smaller indoor air-conditioned area, and a larger sheltered outdoor area. They have a pretty good sized play area for toddlers and children which is a big plus. We were very happy with the dishes we ordered and here are some we recommend anyone to try:1) Curry Debal (chicken)- A mix of cabbage, potatoes, cucumber with bacon bones and chicken meat pieces cooked in a curry sauce.2) Cambarang Chilli Garam - de-shelled prawns stir-fried in chilli paste and salt. The menu offers a good spread for return visits and we have already made our next reservations :-)

Eurasian food has a long and interesting history. It is a blend of Chinese, Malay and European food styles developed by Eurasian families over several centuries. Most of the food was cooked by Eurasian mothers in their home kitchens and their recipes were guarded as precious family secrets. Quentin cooks the food he grew up with and has made the family recipes he sells in the restaurant available through a cook book you can buy in the restaurant.Quentin's restaurant is on the ground floor of the Eurasian Society Building in Singapore. Both indoor and outdoor sections are available and there is a great play area for children included.We had only two dishes, a prawn and pineapple sweet and sour curry and a fish and soy ball soup. Both were excellent, with the curry very tasty and full of large, juicy prawns.This is not a cheap and cheerful eatery but a well put together restaurant. Our bill for the two dishes plus rice and a later slice of cake came to $52 Singapore dollars.Quentin's has an interesting menu and order system. Each table has a tethered iPad containing the menu with pictures and full explanations. You can order for your table and view the bill without having any human interaction at all. This could explain the fact that the staff did not show a lot of interest in the tables.The menu is not huge, but manageable and varied.I know some of the reviews here have not all been good, but we were very happy with both the food and the service (once we asked for it)
5
It was a wondeful experience for my family at Quentin. My kids love the playroom and my parents love the live band. My wife loves the oxtail stew. I love the service. Overall a great day there.
4
Good food... nice ambiance.... friendly stafff.... live music (golden oldies)..... recommend this venue for a laid back chill out evening to all those who love food.
4
Service recovery was acceptable. I think the staff tried their best and they accepted that I went back the next day to pay as I was out of cash as their card terminal spoilt last minute. You did your best..Would go back again
3
Desserts were served before mains, and the orders were wrong. Overall, the food was good value, but the service is terrible.
5
Amazing food. Great vegetarian choices. Play area for the kids. Love it every time. Recommended for sure
1
the staff was rude and gave terrible service . not worth going there at all n would not go there again
5
Ticks all the boxes for - cosy restaurant, live music, kids' play area, pocket friendly and delicious home cooked food
4
The restaurant is definitely worth a visit if you relish Eastern flavors.The portions are large and the prawn dishes that we had ordered were quite good.You get a complimentary bowl of prawn wafers with a spicy dip to begin with while you place the rest of your order.There are fresh juices and wines besides alcoholic beverages on the menu. There is a fairly decent bar besides both indoor and outside seating.The menu has starters, main course and the desserts. In desserts they serve hot as well as cold desserts.We've been there twice, the taste and quality of food has been consistent. For 2 people one main course is good enough since the portions are quite generous.There is an old world charm in the ambience. The staff are warm and helpful.Ample parking is another plus point.Overall worth a visit and a re- visit
4
Food was really good, service was a little slow (we arrived on the dot for 630pm service), but the staff were very friendly. Prices are really good for the portions; three adults and 2 kids, with drinks, came up to about $100+. Loved the dedicated play space for our kids (access to hand sanitizer makes for bonus points!). Will definitely return to eat our way through the rest of the menu
3
Had dinner on a weeknight and it was nice as it wasn't crowded and food was served promptly. Many had complained about the inattentive service which we did not experience - there was always a wait staff around and they responded when called for.We ordered quite a number of dishes for 5 adults and the portion sizes were generous and sufficient for 2-3 pax per dish, as they claim. Amongst all our 10 dishes, the least impressive really was the devil's curry which tasted more like a tomato stew with meat. That was disappointing.In most other restaurants, kids' meals are priced lower however at Quentin's, they are priced exactly the same as a main dish and that's because the portion is still pretty much an adult portion, and it comes with juice and a scoop of ice cream. So for young kids, you can afford to share an order amongst 2.Dessert isn't fantastic - Bubur Terigu was of a porridge-like texture, thick and full of coconut (lacking gula Melaka) and the Sago Gula Melaka had a consistency fit to consume out of a straw!The playroom which is a huge draw for families with children between 2-6 years old was worn out and had a very strong smell of the air freshener (a little overwhelming IMHO). Ball pit didn't have sufficient balls for kids to really play in and many of the toys were broken or damaged beyond use (and really should be removed for safety).Overall, a decent meal and evening out for the family but would be awhile before we would return again
3
The food was delicious and value for money. The prices is not on the high side. Service staff were helpful and able to recommend some of the dishes.
4
It tasted like your mum spent hours in the kitchen when she was really enjoying quality time with the grand children in the kid's play area. Highly recommended for a good family meal.
5
Live band talented, yummy local Eurasian dishes, good beers, dedicated indoor kids play room, it's a perfect family restaurant!
4
The food was ok, a bit sweet for my liking, but the playroom was awesome. It's actually similar to some of the toddlers section of indoor playgrounds that you would have to pay to use and they provide this for free!
5
Went there wih a group of friends. Excellent food service and live band:) Would definitely recommend.
5
Very good food, affordable prices. Live band Friday & Saturday nights. Ask for terrace or at least avoid aircon room if you want to hear it well.
5
Really enjoyed the dinner. Great flavour. Live music. Service a bit on the relaxed side but no real problem. Will be back!
4
Good food, good mix of spicy and non spicy food. If you like spicy food, this is the place. Food served hot and fresh. The dessert were nice too so do not forget to leave room for that.Servers abound but somehow, they seemed more focused on themselves than customers. No issue though, as it was an overall excellent good meal. Will recommend to try for sure
3
We were there on a Wednesday evening, and it looked like there were only 2 other tables there that night.Service was good as you can imagine, since they had a full complement of staff but only three, or possibly four tables that night.The service however, did not make up for the somewhat pedestrian quality of the food.The pièce de résistance, the Curry Debal, hardly raised a sweat with my brother, who is not known for his tolerance of capsaicin. Essentially, he can't take chili, but didn't blink at this dish, which would normally reduce grown men to puddles of sweat!The rest of the dishes fared no better.The oxtail was insipid, and the chicken wings apparently had no salt in them!The only dish that was decent was the fried fish. The long beans with beef, the sambal fish... well, they were edible, but nothing spectacular!Would I come back? Maybe... perhaps it was not the kitchen's best performance, and perhaps they can do better.I might try again on a Friday, when there is live entertainment... we shall see if the mood strikes..
4
Waited about 40mins for our food. Apparently they had a catering order to fulfill but by 7.45pm, we were really hungry. Food was ok, the ladies finger and oxtail stew were good. Dishes are mostly spicy, even if lightly. the corned beef fried rice was slightly spicy and tricky with children. The playroom was the highlight so at least the kids were happily playing while we had to wait
5
We've been going to Quentin's a few times in the past 1+ year. Love the food, people are friendly and the playroom is awesome!
4
Good food done with heart and attentive service. Highlyrecommend the fish dishes! Quiet and ristic place perfect for gatherings.
5
Went for dinner with the whole gang (in laws included). Really love the food here! Good beer on tap too! Very nice ambience.
2
If u bring ur own bd cake n wants it served , expect to be charged $20 .
The only redemptive feature of this restaurant is the kids corner.
4
Had a dinner with friends but and ordered several of the signature dishes. Generally food are fresh and well prepared. Selection are well spread so do try different dishes. atmosphere are family oriented with indoor and outdoor seating. Food serve are prompt and so as the clearing... we felt rushed into finishing our dinner as our tables were cleared almost immediately while we wanted to hang around slightly longer to chat with drinks
3
Very little parking nearby. As a result, we were late for our reservation. We were put in one corner with a really small table. No one checked if we booked via Chope. I know the waitresses were really trying their best. Hope Quentin's sees the need to hire more staff
4
Unless you know someone who cooks Eurasian dishes, this place is probably your only option for a taste of traditional Eurasian cuisine. Go during weekends for the additional live band experience. But the loud spirited performance could get in the way of friendly conversations. And the desserts are quite an acquired taste
4
The place was not crowded on a Sunday evening, so we got a table immediately. The kids were excited to be told by the staff there's a play room, and we were offered to take the table near the play room.Service was warm and friendly. A bowl of fish crackers was served as appetizer. Free flow of ice water and white rice. Waiters walked around with bowls of rice and they scooped it out just before the dishes were served.We ordered crispy pork luncheon, curry captain chicken, fried beef steak and stir-fried mixed vegetables. All dishes tasted great. The portion was perfect for sharing between 4-6 pax.Ambience was good. Too bad we could not choose to turn off the ceiling fan that was right above our table, as all fans had centralized control.Playroom was perfect to entertain the younger ones, suitable for 6 year old and below.We'll come back another time to also try out the desserts
3
We arrives earlier than our appointment time, and we requested for indoor seat when we were given a patio seat (Believe I did made my request during reservation).The waitress politely rejected us stated the indoor seats was taken by reservations which was made at least 2 weeks in advance or so. I reasoned since we were early, couldn't we be arranged a better table, anyway, after seated for 5 mins at patio another service staff made arrangements and we are shown to an indoor table. Even by 8pm plus we finish our dinner the restaurant was pretty empty on New Year eve. Eurasian food seems to have peranakan influence but the tastes is still distinctive different. The food is full of flavours and warm, but not exactly pipping hot. We didn't wait very long after our order, seems to me the food is pre-cooked and heated up. It is like 'atas' peranakan western fusion. I probably wouldn't come back again since is rather pricey for average quality food
3
Plan to have a nice dinner with my family. My 3yr old Son definitely enjoyed himself at the play area.Never seen my dad asked for more rice (3times robe exact) and my Mom, OK she's a Peranakan so she thinks she can cook better :PFood was ok (except $18 for kids meal is a bit cut throat)Everything was fine until the manager ruin the whole experience dining there! She was inflexible and rigid.I never had problem with other restaurant when I didn't print out the voucher, I can either email to them on the spot for them to help me print out or they can scan the QR code. But this manager says NO, to everything, refuse to take an extra step, go an extra mile! Hey we're living in a city and everyone is on the Go with the convenience of Smart phone whereby I made the reservation online and bought the voucher on the spot. Such a big restaurant don't have an office or printer to print how about the device to scan the QR code like other smaller restaurants?All it takes was that one small step and U probably gotten yourself more loyal customers to come back again
4
There's a nice play area for kids with a big TV showing cartoons. For those who sit outside, you can enjoy the live music. Food wise, the curries are lovely.
5
Festive and friendly atmosphere with long decorated tables and yummy, home-cooked food. A great kids playroom and an amazing live band playing rare oldies!
5
Nice food, friendly staff and reasonable priced in a relaxed environment, suffiecient parking space direct at the venue. For kids there is an airoconditioned playroom! I can also recommend to visit the Eurasian Assosiations' Exhibition in the same building. (take notice of the opening times)
1
Service was bad. Definitely shorthanded. 4 staff for a packed restaurant. Soup came 20 mins after being chased. White rice should be complementary given the mains were savoury and thick. Was charged $2 for bowl of rice. Ham, turkey and beef were dry and tasted like leftovers from Christmas eve. Sugee cake was the only saving grace
4
We were a group of 4 families, comprising 9 adults and 4 children. Appreciate that the restaurant reserved a table for us just next to the playroom. The clear glass separating the playroom and the eating area is good for parents to monitor the children in the playroom. Food was good but could be better if there were more non-spicy dishes in the menu, considering that it is positioned as a family restaurant. The only setback was, a piece of plastic found in our scoop of D-24 icre-cream. The staff only removed the price of the ice-cream from the bill at our request. They could have done better in this aspect.
5
We arrived about an hour before the chef , and host Terry found us a seat by the bandstand where three very experienced guitarists would play and sing later in the evening.After Terry took our order, we enjoyed a cuppa tea and each other's company until the kitchen opened, and our three dishes appeared. We shared a very special corned beef fried rice, a wonderful prawn pineapple curry, and a spicy eggplant dish, rounded off with ice cream and gula Malaka. Great food, attentive service, and a funky ambiance, plus a million dollar McClaren parked in the drive
2
Nothing much to complain about the food. We ordered Ox tail curry debal, Permenta fried prawns, Patchri and Meaty cutlet. The ox tail curry and prawns were very delicious but the meaty cutlet is just so-so. We ordered a bottle of wine and the waitress arrived with a bottle of wine that is already opened with the cork sticking out of the bottle. We checked the cork and realized that the cork was dried. It seems like they have already opened the wine a while ago. We requested for a new bottle of wine. The waitress insisted that this is a new bottle and we requested to see the restaurant manager. The restaurant manager came over, drop a new bottle of wine and a bottle opener and left. We have to open the wine ourself! The overall experience was just terrible and I wouldn't go back there again. There are a lot more restaurants which served excellent food and also value their customers.
5
Family party of 6. Called ahead to book and was disappointed that indoor was unavailable - "only tables on our terrace"However the 'terrace' is completely inside with no danger of being affected by weather.Straightforward menu which is available on their website.Food seemed to be quickly delivered - but that maybe because the entertainment was so good... a 4 piece Sri Lankan Band who played unobtrusive covers of instantly recognizable numbers ranging from the 1920's through the 1960'sFood was excellent. Recommend the pork belly the vindaloo and the spicey eggplant.Portions are very big. 6 of us ordered 3 mains plus couple of sides - and we were nearly defeated!Great experience and will visit again.About 200 sing dollars including drinks for 6 hearty eaters
3
This is the kind of place that my parents will go to with their friends. It's laidback, chill-lax and reminds me of the old days. I would do with a lot less lighting in the restaurant for improve ambiance. The waitresses were lovely and friendly, but do not expect this to be a fine dining place. A pity bec it is in an old building which has an old world charm to it. There is potential to make it regal and charming. The food served reminds me of Portuguese cuisine mixed with local flavors, some semblance to Philippine food. The batter of the devil's chicken was over fried, the chicken (with pork) curry was not what I amused to, it was ketchup-y and pork was tough. However the Sheppard's pie was delicious though a tad too salty, and the oxtail was a winner for everyone. The gula Melaka was delicious but it was served in a tall glass which makes it difficult to mix and scoop with a large spoon they served it with. I think the place can make small changes for big improvement. What's great is that this is a real family place. Many locals living nearby come with their older parents and young children, 3 generations! There is a playroom next to the restaurant which is really convenient if you have very young and restless kids.
5
It was a great dining experience as Hubby and I can enjoy our dinner while our toddler (14 months old) plays in the playroom facing us (our table is facing the playroom which has glass walls). There are so many things for the little to play with - cars, ball pit, books (a whole shelf), toys, kitchen set etc! It was well-maintained, clean and air-conditioned! The food was pretty yummy too! Love the complimentary fish crackers with sambal chilli as starters! We would definitely be back
4
Loved the atmosphere, kids had a blast in the playroom, service was friendly and attentive. Food was tasty, although a little on the pricey side. Will definitely be back
4
Nice Eurasian food in a good family atmosphere except for a poor dish of Chuan Chuan (Ginger fish). Fish was not fresh and overfried and not worth the value.
4
Eurasian restaurants are rare in Singapore. A good one even harder to find. Been here numerous times in the last 2 years and will keep coming.

Quentin's not only provided good quality food, but also in large quantities for the price. It's great value for money. As such to have a variety of food for us, a party of three, we had order a good variety of food and the staff readily agreed to help us doggie-bag the leftovers. The live music also added to the warm atmosphere of Quentin's.
4
The outdoor seating was cool with ceiling and wall fans, service was friendly and the food was flavourful. We had the curry captain chicken, prawn coconut based curry, prawn chilli garam, black ink calamari, and fried okra. Everything was great, especially the okra. The prawn chilli garam could do with a little less salt though.
5
Quentin's is easily among our top three favourite food places in Singapore and we are there at least, once a month. The food on offer delight the palette and taste buds. The Curry Debol, Chap Chye, Oxtail, fried Okra are some of the dishes to celebrate with at the table. The wine is fine, too.The Restaurant is extremely child-friendly with a special, cordoned-off, play section.The background music provides a throw-back to the olden, golden era, while a live band strikes on Thursday, Friday and Saturday nights.The only challenge may be booking a table. The indoor seating is limited and popular.A public car park is next door
5
Did the reservation the day of our visit and its just as easy as 1 click as i did the booking through chope.when we arrived we were welcomed by the serenity of the place and the staff were accomodating even helped us in choosing our food. Excellent place esp when u have a toddler with u as there playroom is so attractive for kids and even adults. The food is super awesome..worth the penny! Its just that u have to ride a taxi going there if u dont have a car. But its worth the visit..will be visiting that place again when there's another occasion!By the way, dont forget to try the oxtail! Ul never regret it

My Singaporean family invited myself and my son to dinner one evening, we dined outside and I let the Uncle and cousins order the food, too many dished to remember but a mix of meat, fish, rice and noodles and all were absolutely amazing although one did set my mouth on fire much to the amusement of my son. After dinner my Uncle took us upstairs to look at the exhibits showing the history and influence of the Eurasian community in Singapore which was of particular interest as my mother was of Thai and Portuguese parents. I certainly recommend a visit to both the restaurant for the food and the exhibits to give you a fascinating insight into a small piece of Singapore's history but check on opening times for the exhibits
4
Well worth it. Very tasty dishes - smoore, curry kapitan and a fish curry I can't remember the name of. All delicious. And you can bring your own wine. Plus learn about the prominent Eurasians of Singapore. There is a museum upstairs too, but didn't get to visit that. And the band were excellent.
4
Indoor seating was fortunately available when I reserved a table via Chope. The previous time I was seated outside and second-hand smoke drifted my way. Staff service was fast and friendly. I wish the menu can highlight if pork is included in the dish because I happened to be visiting with a friend who can't take pork
4
Very small number of tables available, some in non air conditioned area. Be prepared for long wait for food on weekends. Paid parking area next door.
5
family bonding with family , good food nice service , overall enjoy the the dinner with my family.. Worth the trip
5
Exceeded my expectations. Especially pleased by quality of the food, diversity and quality. Also appreciated the live band.
5
Great food and ambiance. There's a dedicated kids play area which is great to keep the little ones occupied before and after meal. The band on the weekends belt out great tunes.
5
The buffet spread was amazing! SO much food that I didn't have enough space to try everything. Quality of the food was great!
5
Pros: flavourful and homey Eurasian food, relaxed atmosphere, live music, retro setting, polite and prompt service, generous portions, value-for-money.
Cons: we were sited at a table outdoors, even though we requested for a table indoors.
4
This place is, what should i say, not a usual dinner hangout in Singapore. It serves up good Eurasian cuisine which is rare in this country, coupled with a cosy family environment in easygoing ambience. And the resident band is playing the "beyond the sea", "let it be me" and "all i have to do is dream". It is just a layback location to have a chilled beer and crispy pork luncheon and then enjoy the music. I hope your catch my drift.
4
A great place to try new cuisine - Eurasian food is a real eclectic mix of different European and Asia flavours, but be prepared for the chilli kick! My favourites: meaty cutlets (if you like corned beef hash); patchri (aubergines); curry debal (have you ever had chipolatas in a curry?!); and always sugee cake for dessert. Large terraced area, but advisable to book the smaller air con area when hot
4
Nice place with a lovely playarea for children. Food was generally commendable with generous portions, but some dishes were a tad salty. Service was also quite good. We are however not too happy about our purchase of a promo cash voucher on the restaurant website. We had thought we were getting it on a further discount (given that this word was displayed on the voucher page) but only upon receiving my credit card bill some days after our dinner did we realize with a shock that it was actually charged in USD and not SGD. What made it worse was we had recommended the voucher to friends right after our dinner and they too ended paying more than expected. While the final actual voucher price was still reasonable, this experience left us feeling a little cheated. A pity, as this could have been avoided easily had there been clear indications of any non-local currency during every step of the entire purchase and checkout process on the restaurant website

This is my second time here, but this time, I came with adventurous lunch partners from London who wanted to try more "exotic" dishes like "Feng" and "Seybak". The restaurant Quentin's is like a pub within a community club for Eurasians, but it is open to the general public and not just club members. The place is casual, airy and has a relaxed atmosphere. We found the service friendly but oh-so-slow. However, the food was good...if you like stuff like that, that is. Hahaha."Feng" is a traditional mild curry made with finely diced pork, pork liver and pork heart (yup!). It is a very Eurasian dish. Although we're not Eurasians or Portuguese, we all found it quite tasty. It went very well with steamed white rice. "Seybak" is a salad of braised pork which is traditionally made with pig's ears (yup!) that "lends a lovely crunch", according to the menu. Well, I stuck to the pork soon after giving the crunchy ears a try. Somehow I found it weird chomping on pig's ears. I think these dishes are an acquired taste...if you know what I mean. But those who love these dishes r-a-v-e about them, OK
5
Lovely place, wish we had discovered it earlier. Bookinh with Chope was a no fuss affair, and the restaurant even held our reservation due to the rain. Everyone enjoyed themselves, especially the children as they have an indoor ball pool within the restaurant.
4
Went there for the Mother's Day buffet lunch. Excellent variety of Eurasian "home-cooked" food. If you want a taste of genuine Eurasian cuisine, you will definitely find it here.
4
Awesome homely restaurant with kids enclosed play area!
Nice homely cooked food, attentive service despite busy weekends with full occupancy.
4
Found this place when I was looking for a restaurant which could keep my kid occupied. This place is perfect with great food, nice ambience with live band and a very clean and fun place for my child to hangout!
4
Quentin's has always been a good place for fantastic food.
You don't have to be Eurasian to say the food is excellent.
4
The food was good and the atmosphere was comfortable. It is a yesteryear type of a pub setting that was relaxing and casual. The band played covers from the past that was enjoyable music over dinner. The music was a bit loud to hold a conversation but it was part of the setting. The service was good with friendly hostess. We the menu was not too extensive but a good offering of Straits food. The curry shrimp was really good. Great aromatic flavor with a decent amount of heat. This dish is a must try.
5
Very generous portion. Food is good and service is great too. We were so full that we have to pack 1 home when we ordered only 3. For those with kids, this is a child friendly place with playroom to entertain your kids while you eat.
4
Mom/Grandma-style dishes with lots of gravy and chock-full of ground nuts and spices. The space is perfect for family gatherings, with a great playroom to entertain the little ones, with a very lovely lobby and entryway to the Eurasian Association. Friendly wait staff, albeit appearing confused by requests or variously not offering any acknowledgment â€“ perhaps somewhat unused to the busy pace of a full service? Guests were often left feeling rather confused too
4
An excellent venue to try Eurasian cuisine in Singapore. Tried their Mothers' Day Buffet, which was real value for your money. The variety was great. it's something unique which you do not usually get from your regular buffet.Will be nice if their buffet has coffee and cut fruits!
4
Just arrived in Singapore earlier this evening. caught taxi from Changi airport straight to the restaurant to meet my local friend and his family.This restaurant is clean and tidy, has indoor and outdoor dining plus a small enclosed play area for children, something that I haven't seen before in Singapore.We had about eight dishes between four adults and two children as well as two kids meals.We enjoyed the Chicken Debal curry, beef, pork, eggplant, tofu and a few other dishes...good value and very tasty.We will probably visit again...recommended
5
Service was great, live band, fun play area fully stocked with toys and clean for young kids. Food was excellent, we love the Moolie prawn curry and cake!!.. Burps!!
5
i recommended the following: meat balls (appetiser), ox tail devil's curry, bakulat chicken curry, beef stew. Don't forget the sugee cake!!!
5
we were immediately assisted to our table, and the table that was provided to us is a good spot where we can see the kids playing in the kids area. Place was perfect for family gathering! We will definitely come back!
5
Great experience, nice atmosphere, great foods. My families & kids love the place. Sure be back with my friends for gathering.
4
Nice n friendly staff but they knew to smile a little more. U do not know they r friendly until u engage them.
1
I was there to celebrate my friend birthday. It was a total spoiler.. We order the foods which was delay and only serve 1.5hr later... drinks such as juices, coffee was served 45 min after order.

I had planned a birthday dinner for my husband on 29 April (Fri) and it was a great fun evening for all of my family members. The dinner was simple, we loved the Corned Beef Fried Rice, which we usually try to make at home but it is different when it is wok fried. Other favourites were the Fried Beef Steak and the Chicken Kristang Stew (very flavourful) and my hubby's fav, Banana Fritters served with gula melaka sauce.The Red Velvet birthday cake I had pre-ordered was also delicious with sinful cream cheese and enjoyed by everyone. The extra on top of the cake and food was the band playing good ol' retro music which had us (meaning my mum, dad, sisters) all singing along. And of course, the man running around the restaurant, uncle Terry, was the highlight of the place. At his age, he was more energetic than the other younger service staff ensuring that we had all our food orders, getting feedback on the dishes and if we needed anything else. This is in contrast to the other younger staff whom I had to keep on trying to get their attention to order drinks and other additional orders. The restaurant was not too packed but the staff were walking in and out of the place as there were other patrons sitting outside to tend to but they could have been a bit more attentive to those of us sitting inside the restaurant. Uncle Terry also took the time to speak with us and tell us stories about the beginnings of the Eurasian Association and the famous Eddie Barker, which was great history lesson for us, even for my aged Eurasian parents. A great night to end and a great start to the long Labour Day weekend
5
Curry debal and Fretu kang kong went well with unlimited rice! There is an interesting variety to us who had Eurasian food for the first time! The ambience was relaxing and the alfresco area didn't make us sweat at all. Great choice to have a Sunday lunch. It's ultra family-friendly with a little playground indoors which has a TV showing kids' programmes
5
Alfresco seating at its best. We feasted on Sambal Terong (spicy fried aubergines with dried shrimps), Cambrang Bostador (prawns in thick coconut based curry), meaty cutlets and some more. The friendly waiting staff and the freshness of the food (the slightly long waiting time for each order is justified) make you want to go back to Quentin's for more
5
Although the Eurasians are an integral part of Singapore's social fabric, Eurasian isn't found everywhere. Which is a pity. Because the food at Quentin's was delicious: really rich in flavour. And affordable, sharing-sized portions. We were stuffed at the end of our meal. The atmosphere at Quentin's was great too and the music, the colonial-style architecture, the buzz of conversation all made the meal even more enjoyable.
5
My first time eating eurasian food and I enjoyed all the dishes we ordered! Especially the fried okra and curry chicken kapitan.
Would recommend this to visitors to Singapore to experience authentic local food.
5
Great food , affortable price. Family friendly place. We enjoy our lunch very much even with kids:) really love the foor and the sugee cake:)
5
Excellent food.
Nice atmosphere
We always have a great experience every visit.
Good for family meal, friends gatherings and couple outings.
Must eat the chicken devil curry.
And take some sugee cake home for later if too full.
4
Pretty nice experience at Quentins considering they have an interesting take on peranakan cuisine and having a kids play area that seperate from but still visible from the dining area. Kids menu can be rather limited though. Most dishes are of varying levels of spiciness.
5
This is my 2nd visit in a month. Its oldish charm and great food made it a safe choice for me to host my oversea friends (from UK). The curries & mixed veggies were well-loved by everyone and the live band rocks us with wonderful oldies. One of my local guest decides she wants the band to play during her sister's upcoming wedding. My wife bought coupons for the place, looks like I will be going back again soon
4
Heard so much about Quentin's but never thought of trying until one day my mum was pestering me to go after we heard how nice the food was from her cousin. We finally pick a date and went there. Based on recommendation from her cousin, we ordered the all famous Devils curry, curry mooli prawns, crispy pork belly, baked cauliflower mix veg with cheese and the black ink squid. I personally myself knows how to cook the Devils curry dish as I have learnt it from the famous Nonya Violet Oon and I must say that the devil's curry at Quentin's was very tasty and not at all spicy for my palette although it stated spicy. I also enjoyed the Mooi prawns, the curry was very appetising and prawns were fresh. Pork belly was alright only. I like the black ink squid the best. Although it didn't looked as appetising as it's supposed to be, but the the squid was juicy and tasty. Overall had a pleasant dining experience. Didn't get to try the desserts on the menu but order a slice of the rainbow cake to takeaway. Didn't like the cake though, cake was far too sweet and sloggy.
4
Casual comfortable dining in the East Coast with authentic Eurasian food. Crowded on weekends so better to have reservations. Recently opened public car park adjacent to the restaurant so that's convenient since the building the restaurant is situated in (Eurasian Association) has a tiny car park. Must order the curry devil (oxtail or chicken), patchri (fried eggplants), bendi (sliced lady's fingers), meaty cutlet, pork semur and corned beef rice. Give the roast beef a miss - a little too dry. The Tim soup was tasty. Really must take the Sugee cake - one of the best I've had. Banana fritters abs sago gula Melaka is great too
3
I went to this restaurant with five friends as they had previously eaten there and as they were Singaporeans they had local knowledge. They had enthused about the menu and we're discussing what they would have before arrival. My wife thought the service a bit slow, I did not notice( to busy talking) However, the food when it arrived was no more than average. My friends commented that the food was not as good as previous visits and the menu descriptions did not match previous visits(maybe there was a chef change) I loved the deep fried belly pork and the vegetarian ladies fingers. However the toilets were smelly. On the upside there was live music which, for me was a bit intrusive, but others in the restaurant enjoyed
2
My guest was late for 10minutes for an 8pm booking. I tried to call at 7.55pm as I was caught in a jam. There were no answer to my phone call & when I turn up, my table of 6 indoor was given away. The service staff response is that I was late by 10mins. If they would have answer my call or at least attempt to call, this would not have happen. I happen to be a regular customer too
4
The food was absolutely delicious and reasonably priced. Nice restaurant deco and ambience too. However it took a while for the food to arrive so we couldn't order more items to try as were time pressed for lunch during work hours. Staff was courteous and friendly though they seemed a bit underhanded that day. Desserts did not impress although was good enough
5
I brought overseas visitors for dinner before they departed and they were amazed by the flavours and great vibe - so many delicious dishes and so many happy diners.
The staff did really well despite the large number of parties
4
Quentin's has very helpful staff. We hadn't tried this cuisine before, but the waitperson had good suggestions and we enjoyed the dinner.
5
This is my second visit to Quentin's, and the food is scrumptious! Love the kids' play area too. Will definitely be back.
5
Very family friendly restaurant. Everyone in the family enjoyed the night. Adults love the food, beer and service, my toddler daughter was happily occupied at the play room.
4
My friend recommended me this place and the food was tasty and really like the ambience! should go and try!
4
As a true-blue Singaporean, I'm no expert in Eurasian cuisine (I'm ethnic Chinese) but I LIKE food, and Quentin serves up some truly delicious food. I've been there on 4 separate occasions and each time, I was not disappointed. The restaurant is located in a lovely building, with Peranakan/Eurasian inspired decor. There is a free playroom for children, making it one of the more child-friendly eateries around.Now for the food: the prawn bostador curry, cooked in rich coconut milk with loads of spices, is to die for (I actually Googled for the recipe, only to realise how time-consuming it is to make the dish myself). Pot-roast beef was tender and drenched in a savoury black pepper sauce. Pork semur is one of the more child-friendly (read: non-spicy) dishes. The prices are quite wallet-friendly, though portions could be larger. Another thing to note: the food is a tad salty in general. However, bear in mind that Asian dishes are meant to be eaten with rice hence it is usually more strongly flavoured.The laidback ambience, friendly staff and the home-cooked feel of the food all make Quentin's a winner
4
The staff were pretty friendly and we loved the place as there was quite a big space of play area which helps to occupy the kids.The food was alittle salty to my liking but it was overall flavorful. I personally like the pineapple/cucumber dish, as well as the pork stew and roast beef. The salted caremel cake was my favorite among the others we tried (red velvet and rainbow cake
3
Nice windy ambience but the food left me thirsty like a horse after a hard day of work. Skip the Captain's Chicken. While the sauce is sweet and delicious, the rubbery and bony chicken was especially hard to dissect covered in the sauce. On the whole, forgettable meal other than the fact that it's just a few steps away from my place

Having purchased Quentin Pereira’s “Eurasian Heritage Cooking” cookbook, my wife and I were keen to dine at his restaurant at the Eurasian Community House on our visit to Singapore. We got to Quentin’s Eurasian Restaurant a little after 11:00 a.m. on Wednesday 4th November 2015 by taxi from our hotel.We were among the first patrons that lunchtime. The wait staff were friendly and efficient. From the menu we chose three dishes (i) Galhinia Keluak Curry Chicken – a dark curry prepared with herbs, spices, tamarind and keluak seeds (ii) Rempah Bredu – mixed vegetables and tofu in coconut curry, and (iii) Bredu Chap Chye – a fried vegetable dish comprising lily buds, wood fungus, glass vermicelli, bean curd sheets, cabbage, carrots and turnips. For drinks were ordered freshly squeezed watermelon juice.For starters we were given a complementary bowl of keropok and some sambal belacan. The keropok (prawn crackers) were to be dipped in the hot sambal belacan and eaten as nibbles while waiting for our main meal.The service was prompt and courteous and the servings were generous. The Galhinia Keluak Curry Chicken was an absolute delight, and the taste was uniquely delectable. The waiter kindly gave us a teaspoon each to enable us to scrape out the flesh from inside the hard keluak seed pods. This was unlike anything that we had tasted before – quite palatable. The flavoursome Rempah Bredu and the varied ingredients of the Bredu Chap Chye were a perfect complement to the Galhinia Keluak Curry Chicken.As an unexpected bonus, we had the privilege and pleasure of meeting chef Quentin himself after our enjoyable, sumptuous lunch. He found time to chat with us and to explain to us how the keluak seeds (deemed to be an acquired taste) were prepared for human consumption.We felt so glad to have made the decision to lunch here and to have enjoyed the exquisite Eurasian cuisine at Quentin’s. We would recommend this dining venue and experience immensely
5
I have decided to pick this place after googling for kids-friendly restuarant.We drove for 20mins to reach this place, park right infront of the restaurant that can accomodates around 15 cars, coupon parking.The first thing the kids did was to check out the kids room (air-conditioned). My elder boys did some arts and craft, play with the cars (sadly, the car cannot move) while my toddler enjoying the slide and the basketball hoop.Food wise, oh we love the Fretu Kangkong (water spinach) and Cambarang Curry Nanas (Prawns). Together with the free flow of rice at $1.50 per pax.For the kids, we ordered 2 kids meal at $12 per set (the portion is quite small, like McDonalds value meal set) and comes with a fresh apple juice and a scoop of ice cream (vanilla or chocolate) per set.As this was a last minute plan for Daddy's birthday celebration, we ordered a slice each of the rainbow and salted caramel cake. The kids went right back to the play room after blowing the candle (not eating the cakes) and left 2 of us lapping up the delicious cakes. The children will likes the rainbow cake not because of the color and of the sweetness in each layer too. For adult i would prefer the salted caramel one.Daddy and my eldest boy went to see the mini exhibition of the Eurasian heritage located next to the restaurant.The whole dinner costs less than $90. The kids and us really enjoyed our time there and we are planning for the next trip soon. :)A mummy of 
4
Besides the initial confusion with regards to the reservation, everything else was great. Love the children play area.
4
Our first Eurasian meal in Singapore and I was lightly nervous about taking 2 hot shot Eurasian cooks, my Mum and my Wife! But it turned out well, we enjoyed it and the food had a kick too.
5
This is our second visit and we are loving Quentin's. Food is great and with attentive service to compliment it. We are already planning for another visit as we are still exploring the extensive menu.
5
Depending on the other guests the place can be quite noisy (esp. indoors) but the food, ambience & music make up for it!
5
As usual, I needed my eurasian food fix. With good friends joining me, it made an excellent lunch. Service was great as usual and the staff anticipated all our needs. I'm happy and satisfied 👍
5
This restaurant is a bit outside the beaten path but well worth finding. Ambiance is nice (very suitable for family gatherings) and the food is very good with big portions. There's a good choice of dishes merging together typical south east asian recipes with different flavors for a unique mix. Only drawback was the service as it took quite a long time: almost 40 minutes of waiting despite the restaurant not being crowded at that time. Be patient and you will be rewarded
3
Came here with my family. Was not expecting very Asian dishes on the menu. But majority of the items were actually Peranakan food!Staff were quite friendly but it's always a challenge to get their attention. There's a live band yesterday. Singing suits the atmosphere quite well. Food took more than 40mins to come. There's fish crackers to fill you while you wait. They'll refill it too. It comes with sambal belacan, very spicy, but very good with the crackers. There's a keluak curry chicken, which is like a spicier version of the Peranakan Ayam Buah Keluak. Unfortunately, not as good. The keluak flesh still whole in the shell, which really defeats the purpose of me eating it. Curried prawns were quite fresh, but there's like overly deep-fried lady's finger in it. Not exactly appetising.Baked mixed veggies were basically cauliflower baked I cheddar and herbs which overwhelmed the veggies own flavour. Not too bad.Beef stew was interesting not much like a stew. It's more like oxtail soup. For oxtail soup, it's not bad. Just do not understand the presence of cocktail sausages in the soup. It's a family oriented place, there's even a playroom for kids. But if just for the food, there are better places in Joo Chiat
2
I've tried roasted porku. It was terrible, only fat, fat and fat, no meat at all. Grilled fish was average. Steamed rice was good but you can't go wrong with rice. Fresh juices were good, so was the service. Probably picked the wrong dish. Either way, would never give them another try
2
We were put off by the $20 cakekage charge! Lady server was not exactly friendly and we felt she just wanted to quickly serve us and go. It also seems majority of the staff are demotivated as their faces were mostly solemn and there was lack of service! Overall was a bad 1st time experience!
4
High standard, high quality, freshly cooked dishes at amazingly reasonable price! The dishes were all tasty and just the right amount of spice or sweetness according to the recipe. Dishes we had were:GALINHIA KELUAK CURRY CHICKENCHUAN – CHUAN - Fried Fish in Ginger SauceCAMBARANG CURRY NANAS - Pineapple Prawn CurryPATCHRI - Fried EggplantPLUS: Cake of the day: Salted Caramel Cake and Chocolate Cake to finish off.That was more than enough for 5 people. Their wine selection was also decent. We had a bottle of red and white - each one didn't disappoint.The ambience was quiet on a weeknight, however they are supposed to have good weekend brunch crowd as the well curated playroom is an exciting attraction for the little ones. The glass windows also allows the parents to easily see through to check on their children from the dining area
5
I have nothing negative to say about Quentin's. The food is excellent. Portions are good and the price is more than fair.
The only minor complaint I have is that the Babi Assam, had more chicken than actual babi.
5
This is a great place to eat eurasian food. With a nice terrace and live music on Friday, the atmosphere is great. Best to be at least 4 as dishes are huge but very cheap.
5
Perfect place for good food with very cheap price in a nice environment with terrasse, music... On top 30% off during week days. The food is malaysian, indian, european... Highly recommended for an evening in couple or friends.
4
The debal curry has a unique flavour, though a little spicy but definitely worth trying. Also enjoyed the kangkong and curry pineapple prawns. Top it up with a chendol. The kids corner is also a good idea. The service can be improved, though I guess they are really busy that's why.
5
Bon Dia is his Portugese greeting in the menu while you bury your gaze into his varied dishes to offer.Of course top on the list you won't want to miss out us his infamous Debal curry ... It really whet our appetite so much so that we indulge in extra extra rice not to waste his delicious spicy Debal curry. Thank you shareholder who assisted Quentin in carrying forth his Eurasian heritage dishes, a special ethnic group of Spore four races besides Chinese , Malay and Indian. The pot beef roast need another half hr for it to be soft though gravy was flavorful. Shepherds pie need to be more roasted and brown. Brinjal dried prawns was too minced.Desserts like pulot hitam was too watery and chendol was normal.To avoid crowd go 6.30 o 8.30pm cuz we waited 45 mins with waiters bustling around.For over S$77 for 3 a good home cooked Eurasian meal.Parking us problem though
4
The restaurant has a warm and cosy ambience that is suitable for families - young and old.The food is freshly prepared so waiting time is around 15 to 20 minutes.The sugee cake is a must try! It is moist, buttery and has a nutty taste
5
The chef is a personality him self he is the restaurant and he really knows what is talking about, he comes from a background of a family that cooks well and with real tradition, the food we had was some of the best Portuguese Eurasian cuisine we ever have had and if anyone is passing by Singapore, really stop for one or two days and try this place, we will be back soon thanks for the amazing food 
5
The Pot Roast Beef and Feng Curry are simply delicious! This is becoming one of my favourite place to entertain friends from abroad to show case the Eurasian cuisine. It is such a relaxing and easy going place that you can sit down and chat after a meal
3
The prawn crackers went well with the sambal. Although there were two of us, most items on the menu were meant for 3 - 4 persons. We ordered a bowl of Oxtail Devil Curry (S$22.80), which is fiery and rich, made from chili, onion with blended mustard seeds. It is served with oxtail, chicken cocktails, baby sausages, potatoes, cabbage and cucumber. We found it to be so salty that eating it with rice was a must. The meat on the oxtail did not come off easily; we had to ask for a knife to slice it off the bone. This spoilt our enjoyment somewhat
5
This restaurant is located inside the Eurasian club building but is open to the general public. It is set away a little from the main road, just opposite Duncan's food court. We eat here quite regularly as it is definitely one of the better restaurants in the area. Moreover: it is surprisingly affordable. Eurasian food is an interesting cuisine, not unlike Peranakkan style food, for which Katong is famous, but there are also similarities with what's traditionally served in Goa, for instance. This has to do with the strong Portuguese influence in the food. The curries on offer serve three to four people, as the menu suggests, and this is indeed the case. They are huge! And very filling! Try the one which comes wish sausages which is quite special. Although the food is exceptionally good and the restaurant itself is lovely as well I have two misgivings: for some reasons items on the drinks menu often aren't available and the other one is service: for some reason some of the staff seems quite uninterested in their jobs. But this will certainly not stop me coming back
2
Lovely building and nice deco. Really disappointed with the service, really slow and the waitress were quite rude and miserable. Quite a few things off the menu we asked for they had ran out of. Food ok, would not visit here again!
5
Gives fresh new dimensions to just ur typical rendang...! gotta love spicy if u wanna try most of the signature dishes, n i love spicy! to try: Devils curry
3
The Eurasian community has a great cuisine which is a fusion of Indian, Malay, Chinese and a little bit European. Unfortunately, Quentin's does not do it enough justice.
5
the residential setting makes this lovely restaurant a unique ambiance for busy singapore, one gazes over the patio at greenery and feels less fretful.the keropok and sambal goes well with beer whilst the wonderful range of curries, stews and peranakan specialities never fail to amaze with their variety and flavour - every one has its own special tastei always try to have the sugee cake if its available - its a miracle of ground almonds and brings back fond memories of childhood treat
5
Ate here with some friends recently and enjoyed every bite!! Hard to describe fully, but the food was fantastic- one of dishes we had was like a tomato based stew with chilis, pieces of bacon and sausage- YUM! We had cooked eggplant as well- excellent. Everything we ate was good and I highly recommend this restaurant to anyone interested in variations on Asian fusion food. Really well done and all of it was delicious. I'd never heard of Eurasian Cuisine before my friend suggested visiting and I have to say this is underrated! I'd say that I even like it better than Peranakan. Hope to come back again on a future visit to Singapore. As an extra plus, portions were quite large

There are not that many restaurants in SIngapore that specialise in 'eurasian cuisine' - Singapore style. Quentin's is, in my opinion, provides an experience that's as good as it gets. i liked almost EVERYTHING i tried. Ros Befe, Debal Rabu De Baca (Oxtail Devil's Curry), Galinhia Keluak Curry, Babi Assam and Patchri ((Spiced sweet-and-sour Eggplant). all amazing. the beef cutlet and the chicken wings were not as spectacular, but only because i compare to the main dishes. The service was great, the chef was humble, and the ambience was delightful. It shall be my regular neighbour resto, and somewhere that i will bring my visitors to for a piece of Singapore's heritage

Went with some Eurasian friends who know their food. Quite nice ambience. Very good service. We ordered four dishes. They tasted good but the curries were filled with potatoes, with just scraps of meat. We paid about $92 for three people, including dessert. Felt very cheated. Not going back again

Heard much about this restaurant from Eurasian friends, and it didn't disappoint. The indoor section is quite small but no problem getting a table on a weekday evening. The Oxtail Devil Curry wasn't as spicy as I would expect, and the Patchri (sweet & sour egg plant) was fried just right though a little on the sweet side. The Chapchye (mixed vegetable) was packed with an assortment of ingradients and was closer to a home cooked stir fried vegetable than some Peranakan's Chapchye. Retu Tinta Choka (fresh squid fried with onions & garlic) was perhaps one of the best I have tasted but certainly not for the faint hearted with the black inks!Overall a good dining experience and prices were reasonable for the huge portion of each order

As a Singaporean, i am quite ashamed to say that i have not known about Eurasians let alone their unique cuisine until a friend of mine who is a regular patron at Quentin's finally brought me along for dinner last Friday. Quentin's is the only full-fledged Eurasian restaurant in Singapore-with of course a modern twist to some of its dishes. Their "Oxtail Curry Debal" is to die for!!! It is without a doubt very sinful but hey, You only live once, so if you want to indulge yourself, indulge on the good stuff. we also tried the "Prawn bostador" which, as what the waitress informed us, literally means "slap" in creole Portuguese. and true enough, SLAP-it delivered! The Ros Befe (Pot Roast Beef) was a incredible hit given that we had quite a variety of spicy mains, it was a good distraction from all that chilli... HOT HOT HOT.. and did i mention that they have a good range of Portuguese wines?! We were informed by the waitstaff that they only carry Portuguese wine! (by the way they also served Portuguese beer!) as the theme of the evening was SOMETHING NEW, we went for the GREEN WINE. As we were promised that it goes really well with our food choice, and so with that much good stuff, how can a night go wrong? and yes, in line with the heritage food, you can also view the showcases at level 1 and 4. entrance is free. we did visit the showcases while waiting for our food and from then on, we were educated... by the way, if you guys are intending to go there for a makan feast, i suggest you call in advance as the air conditioned room seats is limited. trust me, you dont want to be outside, sweating profusely from all that chilli!We learned that they actually have an acoustic band every friday night. which is tres cool coz if you've been there you will understand my point. the place is really cozy, peaceful and undeniably charming. nuf said, go check it out for yourself
