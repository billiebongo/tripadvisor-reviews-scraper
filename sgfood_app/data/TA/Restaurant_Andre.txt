Closing on Valentines Day after 10 years around. I liked the green spaghetti. Almost 28 bites from the menu and more than 3 hours of eating a master artpiece.

Really great dining experience. Always wanted to try Andre's 'edible art' . Foie gras mousse was out of this world. A place that will always be remembered.

We went to this restaurant several time and it is very nice with food and location.The staffs here are friendly and take care us well.Singapore is a busy country but eating in here is different with quite atmosphere.We will back in the future.

Andre includes a lot of his signature dishes in his OCTAPHILOSOPHY as he closes his last chapter in Singapore. Please do take a look at the pix of the menu attached. Andre grows his own vegetables & uses unique ingredients to help expand patrons' palate. I could feel his frustration @ his Restaurant in Singapore as a lot of the patrons have failed to appreciate 'food'. I was told that a lot of his dishes have been returned to the kitchen unfinished and sometimes even untouched. A lot of patrons have come to ANDRE simply because they want to click off this box on their bucket list....

A truly fantastic fusion restaurant with excellent creativity.My first visit to this restaurant was in March 2012 when it was slightly over one year old. That time, it was not easy to make a reservation due to lack of on-line booking and the restaurant was small and rather popular. Later years, it was also hard to make reservation because the restaurant was doing so well that the phone calls were being ignored and the online reservation apps then was poorly designed. When I complained to Pam, wife of Andre, about my frustration, she gave me her personal mobile phone number.In recent years, the reservation issues were no more an issue but the prices were an issue for me - not sure whether it was really still value for money when compared with Les Amis.My last visit was on the 8th Sept 2017 when there was a visiting Michelin Star Chef Maaemo jointly prepared a special lunch with Chef Andre. Most of the dishes served were from heaven and I shall let my attached photos do the talking. There was one not so successful pork dish where the chef mimicking the Chinese cooking by baking a wrapped meat inside the clay. It was tasteless and hard. But the wine pairing was interesting and great.On 11 October 2017, Andre Chiang announced that he would be closing Restaurant Andre with its last service on 14 February 2018. He also mentioned the prices which he would charge from then onwards and the prices were insanely too high that I would not like to condone such practices.Good bye Chef Andre and Pam! Wishing you folks all the best in your new endeavour.We shall miss you and your creativity

Wow. I had the most amazing dinner here over the weekend. The menu was inventive and I truly enjoyed each course on the degustation. The wine pairings were also extremely complimentary to the courses. The restaurant is beautiful and has a lovely atmosphere. The service - incredible. The staff are charming and knowledgeable about the menu and history of the chef and restaurant. Met Andre on the way out - wished him well with his new endeavours - this venue will be missed

Had a new Year's lunch at Restaurant Andre with my family, our second visit. Staff greeted us upon arrival. Presentation of the food is interesting and beautiful. Wonderful balance of flavours, colours and texture. You can feel that there is a lot of thought that is put into all the dishes. Great pairing of wines too. Especially like the Singapore-theme desserts, with kaya macarons, local ice-cream, etc. Fantastic lunch which we all thoroughly enjoyed and will remember. Only a pity that Chef Andre will be closing his restaurant soon.....

We could not choose a better restaurant for our starred honeymoon dinner. The menu is not only tasteful but also cool to look at. It’s pricey but you get a lot for what you pay. If you’re planning on going, get ready for an intense dinner

I rated very good only because here and there, there are many things they could improve. First of all, the staff opened the door, yet let people wait at the small waiting area without any warning of when they could get to their table. Which I should assume to be right away since there's no seating prior. Upon getting to the table, we kept being pressured into ordering wine even though we don't like drinking. There are many reasons why people don't drink: health, pregnancy, or simply choice! We felt we were treated as if we were too skimpy to order wine...!?In general there was an uncomfortable atmosphere as the staff generally wanted you exactly then and there. They even told my friend who was heading to the bathroom point blank to return to her seat soon because they are about to serve. How rude to say that to a lady! They have a tiny toilet, it's not like anyone is going to stay there for long taking pictures... Food wise - some dishes were excellent. A few I didn't love. Some were too salty, or sour... desserts were disappointing compared to the rest of the menu. I'd still recommend Andre cos the food is fantastic. The staff need to chill out a little and remind themselves that customer experience is important too!
5
I am speechless after dining at Restaurant Andrea the food, wines, ambience and attention to details are just perfect. If you want to impress your guests or fiancé or to experience a modern fusion gastronomy then you must visit this restaurant. Chef Andrea and his wife are very passionate and I had a privilege to dine at Chefs table right next to the Kitchen which is spectacular. A once in a lifetime experienc

need booking, long booking list.
Chef owner thinking of closing this brands soon in recent articles as there were other 3 stars also follow the same.
Chef Andre is now more interesting to help others as he is also very well know in Taiwan also.

Exquisite, experienced, expensive. A truly sensory dining establishment.
Don't take my word for it - seize the last opportunity to pamper your palate, for it will shutter for good in a matter of months.

This place is amazing everything was spot on. What a fantastic experience, the food was delicious and the service impeccable. Loved every minute of our experience there. Thank you!!!
5
We had dinner here during our short visit to Singapore. Worth booking in advance to ensure you get in. From the moment we entered, the service was very friendly and efficient. We had a lovely corner table looking out the window. 8 courses of bliss and beautiful flavours, carefully prepared & presented. It’s not just a dinner, it’s an experience. They accommodated my allergy and ensured we were had an amazing experience to cherish! Tip: just go before it all closes in Feb 18. Just a few pics to tempt you
5
We ate here last November and I forgot to post here on our experience however I can only say if you are looking for first class food, first class service and a wine list to die for then Andre is the place you have been looking for in Singapore. One of life's great experiences
5
An outstanding restaurant and justifiably ranked so high in the World Top 50.A relaxing room where you do don't feel constrained by neighbours too close. Excellent service at all levels from the kitchen through to table service and the sommelier - everyone is so professional and communicates so well with the diner.We had the perfect meal - a lunch with just enough courses to enjoy a leisurely afternoon but not feel it was an endurance test as so many tasting menus.Amazing quality produce beautifully presented. Full marks too for the way they worked with my wife's allergies - nothing was too hard for them to work their way throug
5
Had the pleasure of dining there before it shuts!Great great food even at Michelin star level. The presentation was excellent too. Andre came out and talk to everyone at the end which was a nice touch. We got to ask him a few question. When we were leaving, we asked if they have any recommendation of bars or pubs around here. One of the waiter even escorted us to the bar up the street which the restaurant had liaison with. A bit weird to have staff to escort you right to other bar up the street. Anyway hope everyone gets to enjoy his food before his next venture.
5
Sad that Andre is leaving Singapore, the presentation, taste, service at this restaurant is a level above the rest compared to other similar priced restaurants. A league on his own. Do visit if you can before Feb 2018. Unfortunately the meals are not priced differently from what it used to be

Visited Andre for our wedding anniversary and were not disappointed. The food was excellent, and IMO above both Cornerhouse and Odette at the top of Singapore's fine dining restaurants. Every dish was perfectly prepared and they happily catered to our request (in advance) for the replacement of several of the seafood dishes with other options. A lot of thought and balance has gone into this menu and it shines through in everything you eat. Our Sommelier was also excellent, as we didn't want to drink too much, he was able to recommend a white and red to compliment each group of dishes. Chef Andre also took the time to come out and talk us through his inspirations for the menu and the restaurant and shared his passion for the products he puts on the plates.I only have two small complaints about the entire evening. Firstly, I think the tables are slightly too small for adjacent seating, as my wife and I couldn't sit too close to the table as we kept knocking into each others knees (and we're hardly giants). The second small complaint is the smoking technique they used on several dishes. It tasted like an chemical was used to start the charcoal burn (such as lighter fluid or petrol) and this chemical taste was unfortunately present on some of the food items. On the swordfish it was so noticeable, I felt like I was breathing out petrol for a short time afterwards. I enjoy smoked food, but think a more authentic wood smoke would really benefit some of these dishes.These are the reasons it doesn't get five stars, but everything else was so good from small bites to start to the little bites box after desert that I can't find too much fault.Look forward to going back again in future

We went to restaurant André during the F1 weekend, we actually had to book it 3 months in advance and have to it totally exceeded our expectation.Food: simply amazing... No wonder it's the #2 restaurant in Asia. I'd say it's the best meal I've had. 24 dishes which took us nearly 3.5 hours to finish. Every single dish is an art and has its own story. I would strongly encourage to do the wine pairing as the wine really brought out the flavour of the food.Service: I've been to other Michelin restaurants but the service we got from restaurant André is out of this world. The General manager (who's also the wife of chef André) was at our table most of the time to explain the dish and its concept. The Sommelier was very patient in explaining each bottle of wine and introducing different areas of France to us.Chef André came to all tables at the end of the meal and took a picture with us. I was particularly impressed when they showed us the kitchen on ground floor on our way out. My friends and I are all very pleased with the dinner and it has certainly made our F1 weekend extra special.

One word - Outstanding
Restaurant Andre is in an incredible experience, which leaves you wanting to return.
An Imaginative and creative food odyssey, coupled with a friendly approach from the front of house team.
A must do when in Singapore.

The cuisine at Restaurant Andre is out of this world. The tasting menu brings you close to 30 unique servings (some snacks, some full courses, some desserts) and the creativity, thoughtfulness, and beauty really shines through. Andre's concept is fascinating to me. His "octophilosophy" is something I would love to experience endlessly, as it lends itself well to constant culinary innovation. I won't go into details as to specific courses, but just know that you are in for a SERIOUS treat. This was one of the most memorable meals of my life. It was even more special that Chef Andre came out at the end to chat with us about the experience, and also that his wife was one of our servers! It made the experience increasingly special and memorable. What an amazing and humble couple despite all of their incredible success.So why the four stars (and not five)? I was very disappointed that Restaurant Andre only offers wine as the alcohol option. My partner and I love to have cocktails with tasting menus, and I've never had that be unavailable before. Even a simple gin and tonic was not on offer. For some this would not be a big deal, but this was a let down for us.Nonetheless, I would not hesitate to return if my travels bring me back to Singapore.

The reservation could be a bit complicated but we managed through it. It turns out worth it. The restaurant accommodate our food restriction well and the services is great. The wine pairing is great but we are not big white wine fan. However, they came up with very great alternatives. The only issue is the annoyed customers next table. They are more for photos than food. I don't mind people taking photos. However, keeping using flash even with some warning from the restaurants, they seems not care. Btw, they take more than 20 photos with flash for almost every single dish. This is really annoyed! Whenever the restaurant reminded them, "ooops" I am sorry... but every single time. I think it's the customer needs re-educated
5
The restaurant is elegant yet cosy. Food was so mind blowing. I love how the dishes are created according to the Chef Andre's philosophy. I really love the plating of all dishes. My favourite dish is one where the squid was made to look like Japanese udon and was served with spinach and mash potato purÃ©e

I did not have a good experience with this restaurant and I have not even visited, let alone eaten there. So this is really a review of their reservation system/ procedure. I am left with the impression that they are busy (in this instance the excuses were 'with service' or 'filming in the restaurant'). Interesting for me to learn that in this restaurant booking customers is not an important function. I suggest that the Michelin Guide judges also include 'ease of making reservation' as one of the criteria for their award. In summary 2 days after my attempted reservation, I WhatsApp'd them and they told me my enquiry is not found in their system, that they take 48 hours to revert (what?) and that they are fully booked on the date I had wanted. I am blown away by the amount of effort needed just to make a reservation. I have made reservations at another restaurant, the online system was easy/ intuitive and I get immediate response --- all good
5
Of all of the hyped-up restaurants in Singapore, I feel that this one definitely lives up to all the expectations. From the moment you walk in and are greeted by Andre's wife to the end of the night when Andre walks you out, you feel like you're the most important person there (even though you'll be surrounded by others having a similar experience). Nothing is rushed, the service is impeccable, and the food will make you think you're dreaming. Despite the great ambience, high price tag and fancy plate ware/utensils, it never felt pretentious. One thing I found troubling, however, is that despite the interesting and well-curated wine selection, the restaurant takes too much of a premium on the wine and makes it hard to order anything from the wine list or get the pairing. Also, they ask you if you want champagne when you sit down but don't tell you if it's complementary or how much it costs for a flute - that's my fault, I should have asked but it ended up being over $150 for two flutes of champagne. It was good but I would've rather spent it on the pairing or otherwise
5
This is, without doubt, the finest restaurant I have ever eaten at.The restaurant itself is unobtrusive but beautifully set out. We were delighted by the calm and understated elegance of the dining room. Once they had warmed up, the staff were great. Striking exactly the right balance between friendly informality and taciturn efficiency. My only comment is that all of the staff wear a radio ear piece- given that this is a small establishment I found that surprising. It also gave a slightly 'night club doorman' aesthetic. Special mention should go to the sommelier. It was very pleasing that rather than pushing a 'wine pairing menu' which leaves you increasingly drunk and overwhelmed, he took a much more flexible and accommodating approach. The wines themselves were also endlessly interesting and well pitched. The food is sublime. Each course had something new to love in it. The quality of execution is formidable and the flavours were at once fresh and innovative as well as being classically crafted. My one slight gripe is that the dish said to reflect the terroir of Singapore was not made with local ingredients, which could be said to be a contradiction. Nevertheless all the food was a joy to taste. All in all this is an exceptional and world class establishment.
5
Exquisite. Decadent. An experience!I recommend the degustation menu, and a long evening ahead.The wine list is extensive, and the food is to die for. The presentation is perfect and the menu changes regularly, so you can go frequently and always find something new and always find something new and enticing to tease your taste buds with.There is no doubt why this restaurant is a Michelin Star. It is French cuisine at its finest
5
We just had an indescribable dining experience at Andre. The degustation menu started with numerous bewildering snacks that tantalize the palate. Each subsequent course was beautifully presented and the taste could not be predicted, that added an element of surprise and anticipation which is worthy of a 2 Michelin star restaurant. As we do not drink our dinner was paired with fermented juices and tea. We would never had thought that such pairing would enhance the whole dining experience.Service was superb without any fault. Timing was well executed. Finally as a wonderful gesture, chef Andre came out and spent some time with us, very rare for a Michelin star restaurant in Singapore.Andre deserved 3 stars and we hope that they will be rewarded with the third star soon

I enjoyed my special dinner at Restaurant Andre. It was a theatrical and visual feast. I loved the ambience created to feel like the interior of a French chateau. The wine list looked like a vintage first edition you get from a second hand charing cross bookshop in London. Each dish was introduced with flare and the dish many a time was too beautiful to eat. There was artistry in the presentation very much Japanese in character. The wine was superb. A special night indee
5
Went here because of the reviews and did not regret it. It was really a welcoming place. The food was tasty and fresh.
4
One of my Favourite place.
Food is good. Service is good. Nice ambience.
Recommended to come and try if you are in Singapore.
5
Perfection! Perhaps the only 3 star experience in Singapore. The price is irrelevant for such an experience.
5
Good food ,great presentation, attentive service staff for me is absolutely he best restaurant in Singapore .
2
All emphasis is put on presentation of food which is pretentious. Portions are very small and taste could be better. Management and staff act pretentious. Price is also pretentious. Won't go again.
5
We celebrated the ending of our honeymoon at restaurant André and I can tell you it was a very happy ending. The whole experience felt like beeing on a journey. The food with tastes from different corners of the world, pared with interesting wines that matched to food perfectly. With so many equisit experiences and no clue where André and his team would take us next, we felt guided by the best. The experience ended with the head chef himself coming to greet us, which we appreciated a lot. If you want a trip out of this world, book a table. I assure you that you will not regret. We lived happily ever after (at least it felt like it when leaving).Thank you so much to André and his team!
5
High-end 2 star Michelin restaurant offering stunning sublime food. Good size portions beautifully presented. Excellent service to match. Great wine choice - bio wines from France only served by glass or bottle. Also offers an excellent tea-pairing with the food. As would be expected need to dress for this... as tourists we felt slightly under dressed. Restaurant needs to tone down the formality and be more relaxed. Tried to call restaurant ahead of time but phone does not appear to be manned - email is main form of communication. Very expensive but you are paying for the experience!
5
This is a highly styled culinary landmark in Singapore and beyond. The restaurant is so renowned that prospective customers virtually have to apply for reservations which can only be secured with an advance down payment. Is it worth it? Undoubtedly, yes!There is no menu. You get what André and his team has prepared - although a reservation follow up mail asks for advance information on guest allergies (in our case, a member of the party was a non meat and wheat eater and perfectly catered for with specially prepared, individual dishes).The restaurant ambiance is tasteful, modern minimalist and mercifully without the 'temple trappings' of some of André's global peers.The focal point, however, is the food: fresh ingredients, freshly interpreted, often unusually combined and uniformly full of suprises in their preparation, form and highly creative presentation.Although food is undoubtedly the business of this establishment, more than a word should be spared for the excellent and equally unusual wine cellar - around 600, predominantly French, mostly unkown wines from small bio producers. In our case lunch was greatly enriched by a wine tasting led by the much appreciated knowledge and advice of the restaurant's (French) sommelier.Andrè's is not cheap but provides food for thought long after the mainmeal has been digested. Undoubtedly one of the world's top food addresses and trend setters. Viator Colonia

We had high expectations given the reputation of the restaurant. We were not disappointed, as the culinary team was able to whip up some dishes containing ingredients which we normally wouldn't eat, but found nice this time round. Certainly worth a visit for the experience, but be prepared to pay substantially. We did the wine pairing, which almost doubled the total bill. The wine pairing suited the dishes served, but in hindsight, the wine pairing was not really necessary
3
Food and the quality was good, some of the dish really impressed me, like the oyster, represented the salt in actaphilosophy and also the artisan quite stunning, but from the service side view quite disappointed, just the manager (the girl) was able to explain in right way the dishes and let you feel the philosophy behind, the rest of the team were not confident, and what disappoint me more, I was really looking forward to try the fermented juice menu that is well market on the website, but without clear reason not available, I felt that is just a way to market the restaurant not options for who doesn't drink alcohol. Overall disappointed because I was expecting a memorable night but not delivered.
1
Absolutely lousy service restaurant. Staff and management attitude is lousy. Bad service. Just 1 word to describe. Terrible!
4
You have to be fairly lucky to get a table at Andre. Food is exquisite and the pairings are expertly done. Great ambience and service. Very hard to fault this restaurant... just a little bit on the pricey side...
4
Always a pleasure to try famous restaurants based on guests experience, myself and partner do reserve at Restaurants Andre cause want to try better experience about food. Everything was great, service, restaurant environment, the special ones is only food, tastes and creativity. Good job 👍
5
The best French restaurant in Asia. Great food, great service. I went there 2 times (for both lunch and dinner), it was such a great experience. Decoration also nice too.
4
We came here for a lunch date, the service was really nice, we felt welcomed. Dining environment was awesome as well, the food had nice presentation, tastes good but given the price I would say it could be better
5
I personally had my best fine dining experience in restaurant Andre. The philosophy of the elements in his food is very well presented in every dish. Expensive experience, but definitely worth it...!!
5
We had the dinner there are very nice place and have the good service .The people are working there friendly and honestly .
3
I had dinner there a couple of times. The food is of very good quality, but not particularly original, and these people, from chef all the way down to waiters and booking staff clearly think they are God's gift. Booking is excruciatingly difficult to achieve, with the desk not answering for days, very inflexible schedule requirements, and demand for a downpayment by credit card (a mixture of arrogance and insecurity). Waiters act superior. A 75cl bottle of Evian water cannot be used for the whole table and must be ordered for each guest . The food is very good, but no better than in a few comparable restaurants in the city, where guests enjoy more respect and suffer less hassle
5
In my opinion by far the best restaurant in Singapore based on the food quality, presentation, service, venue atmosphere and general experience. Eating here is very expensive however, so make sure you know what you're in for before booking this. The food was absolutely amazing, but I was a bit disappointed with the wine pairing which I'd say was low value for money. If i go back here I'd order a bottle instead
5
I planned for my birthday dinner with family to dine at Restaurant Andre. Since it was a special occasion I wanted to try something different and unique. And Andre delivered! Of my Michelin experiences this was in the very top league. The surprises, the art, the experiences were all like musical instruments that played well together. I really enjoyed the different textures of the dishes. From the moment we started with the pre dinner mouse bouches to the last little sweet elements. Thank you also for the BD cake. We had the wine pairing and one non alcoholic. The wine pairing somewhat too sweet for some of the wines for my taste, but for my parents absolutely perfect. The non alcoholic different teas and juices were an absolutely perfect surprise to make the experience great for everyone! A true gem, including the story telling with the olive tree in front to the vegetable farms in Taiwan. I will come back - perhaps try for lunch next time! The only thing that is challenging is the long booking in advance, but when you know your dates it will pay off.
5
I am liked lunch or dinner at this restaurants.Their coock very delicious food.And with a reasonable price.
5
We thoroughly enjoyed our degustation dinner at Restaurant André. Its a small restaurant with fabulous food and great service. Staff had good knowledge of the wine and the food they presented. A well earned No.14 for André in "The Worlds 50 Restaurant List" for 2017 (up from No 32 in 2016
4
We were there for our wedding anniversary. Great food with different appearance, smell, taste and texture for each dish. They were so creative that I would not call them French though. The wines paired were, mmm, different. They were claimed to be organic or biodynamic without any big commercial names. And most of them complimented the food well. The service was also spotless. The bill was too high, totalling over $ 1,500 for two. About half was from the wines, none of which were "great". Most were good only. Finally, it came to value for money, and I would say that the wine pairing were over priced. In summary, I would recommend to go for food only
4
We were there for our anniversary. The place was nice and warm... there were only 9 tables and all full! The foods were so creative and always surprised us with the taste...specially pairing with wine. We really do enjoy our night. Till the end when we have ask for bill. Surprised again!!! with the price of 2 people at 1,523 $Singapore. !!!! The highest bill I have ever eat! Even higher than 3 Michelin stars!!!
5
We finally managed to get a table at Andre's! When you enter , you are ushered into a small cozy waiting room , then brought upstairs to the dining area.Service is good, staff explain the concept / theme of the meal , the ingredients etc... as each dish was served , a staff member explained what it was and how it was prepared. For the main dish - Chef Andre himself educated us on his concept and how he prepared it! The dishes are creatively prepared and look very attractive. Each dish was well planned without any waste. The proof however is in the tasting and we were extremely pleased with each dish - tasty, delicious , well balanced , exquisite. Portions are adequate but by the end of the meal you are full. The meal took just over 2 hours but we could have taken longer if necessary.A great meal and worth visiting again maybe after a few months to savour a differently themed menu.
5
I have been to my share of 2 or 3 star restaurants around the world - Andre's is head and shoulders above the vast majority of them!The concept of what and how Andre creates is very innovative and not bound by convention. It is imaginative and follows his philosophy rather than a set menu. Having studied the website I went to the restaurant with high expectations which were easily surpassed. I can't wait to go back to Singapore and get my next fine dining fix at this amazing place.
3
Frech Nouvelle Cuisine Cooking style, very interesting philosophy: "octaphilosofy", and great technique. Maybe a couple of years ago I would've been blown out by this restaurant. However, though my meal was good nothing really blew my mind or stood out. Don't get me wrong the food was good I just hoped it would be mind blowing. I guess it's definitely worth checking out if you're around though when I visit Singapore again I would probably not return not because it was bad but to try more of the restaurant scen
5
Andre is now 2 star although if there is one restaurant to get 3 stars it has got to be Andre. They constantly innovate and stretch unlike other Michelin restaurants that get lazy and stick to the same food. Their prices have gone up but so has any other Michelin restaurant in Singapore so I am more than happy to pay more for Andre's food!!
5
This is an expensive restaurant but there is value for money. There are a good number of, what the staff charmingly called, 'snackies' before your mains. There are 'pre-desserts' desserts. Every dish is lovingly prepared and presented as a work of art. This is the fourth time we have been there and each time has surpassed the previous times and none have disappointed. The quality of the ingredients is excellent with the combination of tastes exquisite. If you have only one restaurant to splurge on in Singapore, Restaurant Andre must be the one. My only complaint (same complaint as before) is that the staff's explanation of each dish is done so quickly and sometimes so totally incomprehensibly that we have had to ask them to repeat what the individual ingredients were. It would be nice if, like many Michelin star restaurants, there was a menu to accompany the dinner for that evening. Other than that, a perfect evening all round. We are already looking forward to returning!
4
An interesting experience - food was carefully planned and prepared by skilled chefs. A degustation menu was intricate and clever. The matching wine tasting was enjoyable and they presented one of the best champagnes I have ever sampled. Not all meals were to my taste but it was a positive experience. Take your check book. Cost for 3 was $2200
5
Probably one of the best meals I have had in my life! The service, ambience,food presentation and description and taste were unbelievable. This is an opportunity not to be missed by anyone interested in food. Just superb.
5
Deservingly a 2 Michelin star restaurant, from the concept to the execution with excellent wine recommendations from the in-house sommelier. Worth the reservation waitlist.
5
Restaurant Andre is one of the few restaurants in Singapore that gives that intimate and personal experience through the culinary journey and romantic surrounding; the others I could associate are Odette and Les Amis.Its standalone building in the historical location where old shop houses were still preserved gave a sense of nostalgia and romance. My wife and I visited this place for a birthday celebration and we had a beautiful evening. We went through the "Octaphilisophy" journey and were mesmerized by the thought behind and skills involved in putting this experience together. Dishes were delicious, fun, and beautifully arranged. We eagerly anticipated the next dish and the surprise element.This was enhanced by the helpful and friendly Chef Andre and the wait staff who were also knowledgeable of the dishes and wines. I enjoyed the intellectual conversations and the passion they shared.Subsequent to our visit, my wife took her sister and friends from overseas to Andre for lunch at two other occasions; I trusted that she had a wonderful time.It's a personal experience and yet one that we shared with each other and friends
5
This is one of the best and most amazing culinary experience ever. I have been to several Michelin restaurants and top world restaurants; however what set this apart from others is the element/themes chef Andre puts in each of the dish. You can taste not just the elements, but really feel the story and uniqueness behind each dish. Of course, you also pay for what you get - two of us, one drink (non-alcoholic), and water came out to be ~850 SG. It was also really nice to be able to meet chef Andre himself. Overall it was an amazing dining experience in terms of both food and service!!!!!
5
We had been looking forward to dining at Andre's since the time of booking, which was well in advance.The whole experience from service to quality of food and the personal attention to detail by the owners was exceptional. Plenty of reviewers have already given details, so won't repeat the accolades.Will we be back, definitely
5
This is the second time I've been to restaurant Andre and it didn't disappoint. Granted the last time I was there was three years ago and I had forgotten some of the dishes I was served there. The service was impeccable and the ambiance was lovely. The food was delicious and there was only one dish that I didn't really like. The signature foie grois and truffle dish is amazing. It's a place that you only go to for a special occasion as it's so decadent and it is expensive. For four of us plus a bottle of their cheaper wine it was just under $2000.but we were definitely full by the end of the night.
3
I must say that this is the second time, I have been dining at Restaurant Andre. The first time was 2 years ago and I must say I was blown away. The overwhelmingly excellent reviews speak for themselves and Andre is in the top 50 Restaurants of the world not without reason.Coming back after two years, I was very excited and had high expectations. The evening started with a tour through the three storey restaurant before we sat down at our table. Andre's wife Sudarampai is the most gentle host you can imagine.The menu consist of 8 snacks, 8 courses and 8 desserts. The reason I am giving only three points this time (5 at the first visit) is that we've been served at least 6 dishes that were on the menu 2 years ago. Some of them were completely unchanged. I understand this for the signature dish 'foie gras creme brûlée with black truffle' but what about the rest? Where is the creativity in cooking the same dishes day in day out for over two years. Don't get me wrong, they are all amazing (except for the new' texture' dish of thinly cut vegetables....Fish 'n' chips, charcoal bread, octopus spaghetti, grapes and peach and a few others - nothing new there. This was very disappointing.One more note on the Sommelier.. Ali was the most charming and knowledgeable chap. The idea to explain the wine AFTER you drank it is however odd and confusing. So confusing that even he mixed up two whites....Going to Andre is something every Gourmet should tick off their list and I'm glad I had done this. Going again and not getting a very different experience was unfortunately a mistake

I've been to over 30 michelin 3stars restaurant all over the world, Most of Andre dishes are weak and lack in finesse in my opinion, a lot of it is a copy of other michelin restaurant that's presented differently but weak. Also I don't think Andre understand what 3 star michelin service is or he just take advantages of singaporean who's willing to pay. I arrived and the maitre'd offered if i would like to start with a glass of champagne? I said "sure". Amuse bouche arrived, first course and for the 2nd course I was given a showcase of White Alba truffle, fancy right? The option was either i have it in 1 course for 5gram(the risotto) or 10gr and they will spread it through the next 4 course. Since I am already in singapore, i decided to go all the way. My logic tells me the 5gram of truffle comes with the $350++ octaphilosophy menu and the extra 5gram I would i need to pay for, since I was never told that the white truffle is an option, Not Part of the $350++ octaphilisophy menu. The options I was given is either 5gr or 10gr, Tricky huh!?On top of it I don't understand why he need to put white truffle on 3 dishes of the dishes? Just to the sell the white truffle? I understand white truffle on the truffle risotto but why put white truffle on top of his so called signature foie gras mouse with black truffle, the flavor of his foie gras mouse and black truffle is very strong, i couldn't taste the white truffle anymore and also the next 2 dishes.Andre if your trying to sell ur white truffle please be more creative as a chef! Shaving white truffle on top of any dishes doesn't make it magic.Towards the end of the meal I was offered coffee or tea and I choose tea.When the bill comes "welcome champagne is $45" (don't call it a welcome champagne then! give your customer wine menu to choose)Octaphilosophy $350++(plus service charge and tax on top)White Truffle 10gr $180 (why was i never told the white truffle is an addition? I was only given the options of 5gr or 10gr)Tea $8 (where's the 3 star michelin service???) Do you understand that part of the 3 star rating is the service

woo super amazing meals ...what a pleasant surprises in between courses xceptional service with very dish beautifully crafted and presented as a work of art. The philosophical menu is based on Chef Andre's “Octaphilosophy” theme of eight dishes, representing Pure, Salt, Artisan, South, Texture, Unique, Memory and Terrior. An Innovative Michelin Stars dinning experience and truly deserving of its No.14 on the World's 50 Best Restaurants list
5
Our experience at Restaurant Andre felt truly special and unlike anything else. Andre's Octaphilosophy takes such an interesting perspective on cuisine, and by the end of the meal you genuinely feel as if you gotten to know Andre Chiang himself. Each dish is overwhelming personal, and tells a story that is authentic to the restaurant's brand. The staff is incredibly friendly, impeccable with their timing, and there is a sense of levity and humor that they bring to the experience which is often lost in the world of fine dining. Andre's wife, 'Pam', was a joy during the entire experience and really made us smile. We were also incredibly impressed with the sommelier, who offered and interesting story behind each glass, which again is an unfortunate rarity in dining. Restaurant Andre is worth every dollar
5
The food and everything there are extraordinarily designed, creative, beautiful and unique until I don't want to have. The taste is also very delicious and worth trying at least once in your lifetime!
5
atmosphere was serene and charming
food was marvelous
service was personalised , great attention was given by the team to us.
5
Food was really good, a real dining event, not for the faint of heart! Chef Andre personally comes out to meet you and tell you a little bit about how the dishes came to be.
5
The experience and food is all wonderfully crafted. The staff is amazing, very attentive, and you can tell there is a lot of love that goes into the food. My wife and I ate here as the "finale" to a 2 month trip through SE Asia, and it was a great way to end a wonderful adventure. The dishes are all unique, and all presented beautifully. It is well deserving of its spot as one of the best restaurants in the world. The staff have all been well trained, and you can tell they really know about what they are serving. Andre is very involved in the restaurant, and while we were dining he came out to say hello. His wife also works there. After you finish your meal, they take you down by the kitchen so you can see all the staff that went into preparing the dinner, and it was very nice being able to thank all of them in person.One small caveat/warning - This is a very seafood heavy restaurant. If you are a true foodie and eat everything, then great. However, people should be prepared for a large number of seafood dishes

Husband and I went here for our 5 year anniversary dinner. I was expecting big things from Restaurant Andre given its reputation, and it really didn't disappoint. I have been lucky enough to eat at a number of award-winning restaurants around the world, and currently Andre is at the top spot.What made it so great?The atmosphere is wonderful. It's tucked away near Chinatown in an old shophouse but inside is very elegant. There are very few tables and it feels intimate but not stuffy or informal. The decor has some very whimsical touches - I loved the sheep stool handbag stands for example. The staff really are excellent too; attentive without being in your face, knowledgeable about the concept and ingredients but don't bore you with all the details; very friendly and happy to chat.The food was DELICIOUS. Chef Andre has an 8 concept menu, which you have to have (but they take into account tastes and dietary requirements). Each course has a theme and it all connects together with the meal very nicely. I was concerned we would come out of the meal still hungry (as is sometimes the case with fine dining) but there is definitely enough to eat with the amuse-bouche to start and little surprises afterwards. The food is presented really imaginatively, highlights for me included an edible mock up of Singapore's Marina Bay, a beautiful french provencal summer inspired dish and a dish that is made to look like a rock garden. It pleased my eyes and then my taste buds. Yum. Another element that made it really special was that Restaurant Andre offers a non-alcoholic pairing menu. It was such a pleasure to discover this, as usually if you don't drink alcohol the option is mainly water. But this was so well thought out - and went extremely well. The Sommelier talks you through it like he would with wine. All in all a wonderful meal and wonderful evening with amazing attention to detail. If you're looking for a special restaurant then highly recommend Restaurant Andr

O.k. We spent a couple of time and visited different 2-Stars Restaurant around the world. This time in Singapore the hightlight was Andre - No2 in Asia and we have to say that evening was outstanding. The service smooth, professional and efficient was great from the start till we left the restaurant. Andre Chiang is a artist in the kitchen and the french influence is good. The presentation and display is just stunning and we had a great time. Wineparing and for non alcohol people a tea juice paring - try it - it is something you never will again in this quality. It was a special evening and we talked to our friends weeks after the evening and we highly recommend that place. Book in advance and just enjoy the journey you will get here
5
I was expecting the experience at Restaurant Andre to be exceptional, but I didn't expect it to make me this emotional. I literally had to pause to recover from the assault of flavours to my senses (in a good way). Perfect for a special occasion meal, or just because you can and want to
5
After reading so many good reviews of Restaurant Andre, I decided to have dinner there with my friends, although I was quite reluctant to spend much money on French food. As my preference was Chinese OR Japanese food. I was prepared to complain what so great about the food, especially we have gone through such a long wait for the reservation booking. However, my perception changed immediately after the food was served. I must complimented the food was very fine and interesting. It is a "MUST TRY" food, at least once in your lifetime. In conclusion, it was Money WELL SPENT
5
My wife and I first went to Andre three years ago and with high expectations and I was surprised to find that the menu and service exceeded my expectations. I thought "OK high end French food, a lot of drama with less substance" but we enjoyed every course. Each time something new came to the table it was an experience for the taste buds. And although some of the courses may look small by the time you get three quarters of the way through the dinner you are full. I'm a vegetarian and my wife is decidedly not but we had excellent individual selections for both of us.We have been to Andre as few times after that. Keep in mind that the desert desert is always so good that I don't want to spoil the surprise by saying too much about it. Just make sure you keep some space in your stomach for till you get to it
5
Went there to celebrate my birthday! Octaphilosophy was a culinary extravaganza from start to finish - where food meets art. A true sensory experience. Polite and knowledgable wait staff. Meeting Andre and his lovely wife was icing on the cake!
5
Hard to add new descriptors of the meal and experience that haven't already been shared. From arrival to departure 3.5 hours later, the service and ambience created was almost faultless - a warm and chatty welcome from Chef Andre, a knowledgeable sommelier and wait staff, perfect pacing of the meal, beautiful presentations, clever ingredient combinations, uses and techniques. Yes, it was certainly one of the most memorable meals ever...including the bill presented at the end. The 'almost' in my review title is down to 2 'details' that rubbed me the wrong way. Being charged for water separately on top of the already astronomical bill seems, frankly cheap on the part of the restaurant. And while perhaps naive on our parts, being offered a glass of Champagne on arrival, we wrongly assumed this was part of the overall tasting menu/experience. Wrong. At a minimum, I suggest presenting a small menu card with aperitifs, waters, etc....with prices together with the wine list and Octophilosophy card. It would make for less of a surprise and shock following an otherwise faultless experience
5
A friend treated me to dinner at Andre recently. Over 20 items in "small" portions so we ended up very well fed. The food and philosophy place this restaurant along the top in Singapore if not in the region. Chef Andre wasn't there (he was on his way back from Taiwan where he has another restaurant) but things were humming nicely - his wife was there and working the tables with ease. Sawadeekap
4
the experience dining at Restaurant Andre would've been better and this couldve been a 5-star instead. There is no doubt that the food that was created by Chef Andre was phenomenal, I especially liked the edible charcoal! The foie gras chawanmushi (Chef Andre's signature dish) was a little overwhelming... Other than that, excellent appetizers & desserts. Would go back once again, with an empty stomach this time. Haha
5
The food and service is amazing... they serve a set menu and bookings are months in advance. Everything is well thought out, from the furniture (my table is sanded by hand regularly by Andre himself) to the service. The tables are well set apart on two floors. The food is imaginative - think chocolate + garlic served as 'dirt' with mini carrots 'growing' and a tiny rake! My fave. The tastes are well balanced too. The bill will be ... but it is the experience that makes it so special. On your return you get a different menu, no repeats! The restaurant is in a nice heritage building, right next to where Singapore's founding father Lee Kuan Yew had his legal practice on returning from his law studies in England
5
It is hard to pick my favorite, but I have to admit I was a sucker for the garlic chocolate soil (you heard it right). They wanted to take my plate away since it's mostly for decoration though certainly edible, and I wanted to finish every little grain! Every dish was a masterpiece in style, appearance and certainly taste! Expensive, but oh so worth it if you enjoy fine dining
5
We went to this restaurant for the most special experience in our honeymoon, somehow we missed the reservation and they kindly managed to have us the next day. We were lucky because we had dinner in the chef atelier and we definitively were really surprised by the food and they way it is presented and served we have not seen anything like that before and we had the best dinning experience in our honeymoon, we recommend it a 100%, thanks for everything
5
I finally have the chance to try this Michelin Two Star restaurant, we have chosen the 5 course meal with wine pairing. The sommelier gave us a blind taste on the wines which come from France, a chance to test on my French wine knowledge after having completed French Wine Scholar. I am impressed with the Wine Book which kept me busy reading for awhile, it looks so old and rustic, felt like I have gone back to the old times working on viticulture! The food and service here are impeccable, before we went upstairs to the dining room, we were bid by their chefs and also chef Andre himself towards the end of the meal. The wines here are mostly from Southern France and matched well with the food, and we had a glass of fermented rice drink made of white, red and black rice which was served in an '11' bottle. I am actually not fond of pigeon and its organs, but I must say this is really fine and tender. We had most of the wine guesses correct except the last pairing with one of the desserts as we never thought the sommelier would match Riesling from Alsace with our desserts. We were completely satisfied and fulfilled after 2 hours of lunch!
4
We came here for my birthday dinner. You come to Andre because you know the food will be good and it was excellent. Creative dishes with delicate flavor profiles and fantastic presentation, for example a plate full of charcoal of which two were bread! We had the wine pairing and the sommelier gave some really unique wines and had us try them first before telling us what they were - that added a lot to the experience by trying to guess what we were drinking. Didn't get a single one right, few people do apparently. It's the kind of place where if you have to ask you can't afford it, be prepared to spend, but as a special occasion it was an excellent meal, creative dishes and presentation, excellent service and a unique wine tasting journey. In that range of restaurants, I prefer Waku Ghin because the food was more exciting in terms of flavors, but Andre was a great experience and if you can stomach the price range, worth visiting at least once
5
I had no idea food could taste or look this good, this creative. Genuine next level stuff. The courses kept coming and half the fun was discovering & uncovering each next masterpiece. Granted, it was the most expensive meal of my life, but worth it? Yes!
5
Great food and use of natural ingredients to make amazing dishes really pleasing on the palate. So much variety and the Food served was so tasty and pretty.
5
Excellent food , Creative menu. Michelin star cuisine . Nice location . Quiet
Highly recommended. .............

Service was excellent, FOOD is amazing. Truly an unforgettable dining experience. One must try it to experience the amazing taste

The restaurant Andre is in a wonderful shophouse. Every floor is decorated in a different style although it doesn't show the polish fake style of other high end restaurant. Perhaps a more accurate description would be "each floor has its own atmosphere". We had the very long dégustation menu for a price tag above SGD600. The food is of course delicious. However personally I am always frustrated by these long menus where some courses are exceptional but too small while other are more classic and ruin your appetite. Andre came himself and was a very interesting and charming man. The whole evening has been a magic experience and would left in any guest the best memories of Singapore. I gave it 4 stars because the price is just too high, even for the cheaper menus
5
This is the dining experience that all upscale restaurants attempt to deliver, though many fall short. Restaurant Andre prepared a fantastic food experience and individualized service that made us feel like we were the only table in the restaurant. The staff are very well trained and quality is assured by terrific oversight from the maître d' and the chef himself. It felt like the team was at our beck and call and whatever we asked for would be delivered instantly. Truly outstanding experience, great food, amidst a cozy setting
5
It's been a while since our visit and there are already many superlative reviews here so adding another may not accomplish much, but our experience at Andre was so phenomenal I feel like I have to pay tribute. On our gastronomic tour to Hong Kong, Macau, and Singapore last August/September, Andre was a stand-out. It was my daughter's favorite among many great stops which also included Amber in Hong Kong, Robuchon in Macau, and Les Amis and Corner House in Singapore, as well as several Chinese restaurants with three Michelin stars. Speaking of Michelin, Andre richly deserves the two stars it earned shortly before our visit on the first ever list for Singapore. In fact, I was impressed to be told that Chef Andre celebrated the occasion with the staff, even though I thought they should be disappointed not to get three stars. Anyway, on to our meal.The restaurant is in an attractive historic house which was the site of the first legal office where the first Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew worked. (Do take advantage of the quick tour of the house they may offer). The multilingual staff are extremely friendly and helpful. The coordination among the staff was easily noticeable, from the moment you walk in until the final group good-bye.We opted for a 5-course lunch and even though it was an abbreviated version of the full menu, it was enough to see the incredible talent of the chef. Each plate is a work of art with brilliant colors and interesting formations. Everything is so tasty, typically in a well thought-out combination of perfectly cooked or prepared items. Chef's exposure to French and Japanese techniques is evident. You experience luxury and simplicity at the same time.The lunch cost 198 Singapore dollars before tax and tip, so yes it is pricey, but not overpriced, given the quality of the ingredients and the level of cooking.It was a pleasure to spent a good amount of time talking to Chef Andre Chiang when he circulated among the tables. We will surely take his advice to return for dinner next time we visit Singapore, so we can fully experience what he has to offer. I wish them continued success, as it is already one of the world's truly great restaurants already

Every time I travel I always check to see what is on the list for the Top 50 Best Restaurants in the world when I travel! Knocking another restaurant off the list! Restaurant Andre was ranked No.3 in 2016 in the World's top 50 and ranked No.32 in Asia's top 50! Extremely blessed to have dined here! I was welcomed at the door and didn't have to wait long to be escorted to the floor where my table was. I was shown the kitchen and introduced to the chefs and was on my way to my table. My waiter throughout the whole meal explained everything perfectly and each dish came out looking so intricate! Tasted amazing as well!! Please do come hungry, you think it's a 6-8 course meal but nope, it's like the gift that keeps giving! I had so much to eat but was completely satisfied! Great staff, good food, beautiful ambiance. And it helped that I had the most dreamiest french waiter ;

Wednesday evening, lead to second floor, nice table. Fairly small restaurant, maybe hint of AC smell. Kitchen open to first floor, so less optimal seating there. Friendly staff. A shower of starters, all beautiful, artistic and interesting. Sommelier a bit slow in approaching and deliver. A series of beautiful dishes with the pigeon as the final main dish. A tad bit undercooked for some in party. 3 desserts, with grape raspberry as top attraction. Tea and small treats. Sommelier suggested we tested French whisky...yes you heard right. We did and .....no don't do it. Tasted like grappa and had nothing to do with whisky. In summary - very good, quite pricey, with a bit of lower scores on the sommelier side.
5
Made the reservations months ahead to celebrate my wife's birthday. Her dietary requirements are very stringent if I can say picky. The restaurant is very sensitive and caters to her requests, as well as some individual requests from our guests. I am very fortunate to have the opportunity enjoying many highly rated restaurants in the world. I must say this one is totally different, largely because of the passion and heart of Chef Andre. We had a great long evening, from 7pm till midnight. We enjoyed every single moment with the great services by Andre, his wife and his professional team. I actually really commended to offer a 24 hours course so that we can enjoy breakfast, lunch afternoon tea, dinner and supper all in one go. The atmosphere is wonderful. Really cannot find one single thing we can complain about. Thank you, Andre! P.S. Please start in Hong Kong soon
5
Came here to celebrate a birthday and it was really an occasion to behold. Opened by Chef Andre Chiang - born in Taiwan, trained in France, opened his 1st restaurant in Singapore, and now with his very own two stars. Instead of having the same service staff, we were served by different service staff throughout the evening which is quite different from other fine dining establishments. But that meant Andre's wife could personally go to all the tables to introduce some dishes, giving a personal insight into Andre's mind as he developed the dishes, leaving us feeling closer and more intimate with him and his creations. Ultimately, the food and overall experience left us feeling awed by the sense of artistry, delicacy and harmony. Stunning, distinctive, and sublime. What a beautiful evening that we will not forget
5
I really think this restaurant should be #1 on TA for their great work of art on Food, and fantastic quality of food. Definitely recomend this restaurant when it comes to a special event in your life.
5
Food is elevated to the realm of fine arts at Restaurant Andre. It is aesthetically pleasing as well as savory.
5
I dined at this restaurant with my partner as part of my birthday celebration. The whole menu looked fantastic, filled with a modern take on French classic.
5
The courses were intricate and fascinating. One should try at least once in your lifetime and more if you can afford it.
5
What a meal! This restaurant deserves its high ratings. The food is a journey of flavours and surprises, creative and playful. The Foie gras was just incredible! Service gets the highest rating, very attentive and knowledge! Best marks for the entire experience.
5
Fine dining at its best! Great attention to detail to tickle any food critic's finnicky tastebuds. Perfect ambience for celebrations.
4
Every dish is pure art at Andre's and his 8 principles of food is all very interesting. It's an experience that you don't want to spoil for others - so not saying too much is better than going into a lot of detail on this review as it will spoil it. But happy to answer questions if you have any but don't want to spoil the fun for others.Ambience is beautiful. Food is picture perfect and it takes it to a new level. Service is not bad, but could be a tiny notch better.Great for a special occasion and the foodie who is chasing michi stars..
4
Very attentive staff and interesting presentation of the meal. The staff contacted me several days before our lunch to verify our food selection via email, which was very thoughtful.We were there to celebrate our trans-pacific gathering from Taiwan and Canada as well as pre-celebration of my best friend's birthday. Food was delicious though I am not sure if the price of the wine-pairing justifies
3
Went to Andre twice for lunch when they first started. I like the deco and the pretty presentation but none of the dishes I like so much that I wanted to go back as I like trying new restaurants... With the recent Michelin award, I decided to try the dinner. I like the amuse bouche (small bite), calamari, oyster with scallop skin, vegetables with Hamachi dish & the chicken main course. It is ok for restaurants to try to sell more alcohol or upsell on the food menu. But if I am paying additional $90 per pax for a white truffle dish, I do have certain expectation. This is the first time I had White Truffle in the month of December. Since it was highly recommended so I tried ...total disappointment! It is definitely worth paying 350++ per pax (exclude alcohol) to dine in Restaurant Andre...if I am to exclude the 'Add-On dish.
5
Small quaint restaurant that is managed by very professional and attentive staffs. We went there for lunch; the food was light and the flavours were complex. You really felt you were taken on a journey of the chef's inspiration. With every dish, the server explained the chef's vision and how they prepared it. I've been to several Michelin starred restaurants in the past and I truly enjoyed my experience at Andre's; it's one of the top on my list
5
French haute cuisine of the highest order, in the form of the chef's own style and twists. Come hungry, it's almost too much. Service, headed by Andre's Wife, also worthy of its two stars and a rare treat in Singapore.
5
Thank you for giving me a pleasant evening. I always love the food served here! An occasional treat but comes with a price :)
5
You will almost miss the restaurant if you blink, but once inside the service is fantastic. The Taiwanese, French taught chef creates some wonderful combinations, fully worthy of the Michelin star. Not cheap, but what do you expect from such a place.
5
Staff was very nice and very friendly, before you arrive at the restaurant they call me to confirm and have a little chat with me a day before. I didnt feel like dine in a restaurant but I dine in close friend house, hospitality here was above standard with friendly and funny staff, always have a little joke for us. Food was beyond, every dish in course was amazing and delicious. Each dish have it's own characteristic but Octaphilosophy combine all the dish to represent Restaurant Andre very well. Thank you Restaurant Andre
5
Was there a few months back and it was so memorable that I can still remember every single detail today!All dishes were so well executed and presented to the diners. Very innovative and great blend to the taste buds. Staff are knowledgeable, friendly and professional. Andre was in town, and he made an attempt to great every table. My wife and I had a wonderful chat with him
5
Amazing chef and staff. The food was to die for, a true experience! Only downsides: corck in 3 glasses of the wine pairing+ you could see staff adjusting the trays of other waiting staff with forceful hand which was not nice. + a girl kept coming down the stairs dressed in an indoor suit, which didn't fit the experienceThe food was creative and innovative. Really a must when you enjoy gastronomy and you are in Singapore
5
I felt in love with restaurant Andre right after the our first dining experience. My husband and I dine there a couple of times a year whenever we are back in Singapore. We loved the restaurant, it never fail to surprise us each time we visit. The private wine selection is just awesome, you can definitely find one that suits your taste. The food is always crafted with love and fresh produce. Highly recommended if you are celebrating a special occasion or just a night out for a fancy dinner.
5
culinary art - the most exquisite of ingredients - presentation second to non. I truly liked the relaxed atmosphere in the restaurant. The maitre d provides an indepth explanation of how the food is cooked and presented and the time taken to prepare the ingredients. Some wonderful twists - loved the charcoal bread, this one kept us all guessing what it was
5
If you are looking for a special occasion, chef Andre is the right place. We loved it all (not the bill at the end which is high (1100$ for 2, but at least the experience is worth the high bill)). Food is great and extremely creative. Service is flawless. No doubt that the 2 stars are deserved. Looking for a future special occasion to be able to go back!
5
Restaurant Andre was definitely an amazing experience! It gave a whole new meaning to how food should be eaten! We had 8-courses for dinner but in reality both the pre-course and after-course dishes were a lot! Combined with wine pairing (1 glass for every 2 courses), we spent over 4 hours and was eventually the last to leave the restaurant at past midnight.Restaurant Andre is quite expensive but every gastronomic experience is worth it. There are nuggets of life wisdom in Chef Andre's Octaphilosophy (Unique, Pure, Artisan, Salt, South, Memory, Terroir). See my photos for a glimpse of how each philosophy is delivered through the food.What a priceless and memorable experience it was to dine at Restaurant Andre! Highly recommended
5
beautiful arts and creative ideas, totally run over the sense. An excellent show in 3.5 hours, every dishes and plates are full-hearted and suitable for each other. It's worth to visit again if the budget is safe;p
江振誠在新加坡的餐廳的確值得一去，在台灣訂不到Raw的可以去新加坡體驗他的餐點跟氛圍。餐具跟餐點的搭配方法令人耳目一心。
5
Dined here last week and was very impressed by Chef Andre - food was amazing! this is a restaurant if you have the budget as it is incredibly expensive, is worth trying.
5
Restaurant Andre was one of the best fine dining experiences I've had so far, worthy of its Michelin stars. You may or may not be skeptical about the "Octaphilosophy" concept that the chef uses to design the degustation menu, but you can't deny that a considerable amount of thought and technique have gone into each dish. Counting the amuse-bouches, appetizers, and desserts, you'll get much more than just the 8 main dishes. So do yourself a favor by having a light lunch. The highlights included an extravagant mushroom "risotto" with freshly shaved white truffles, and a perfectly succulent lamb, fragrantly roasted with cacao nibs. There was almost no weak dish, except perhaps the vegetable with seared fish, which I thought tasted rather average. But even the desserts were impressive, whether it's the geometrically-shaped red grape dessert or the clever, light substitute for the cheese course (which I much appreciated).The whole dinner took almost 4 hours, but it didn't feel tedious, thanks to the floor staff who paced the dishes carefully and explained them with interesting manner, not just repeating the ingredients from one table to another. The service really contributes a lot to the whole experience at a restaurant of this class, and here it was polite, attentive, and knowledgeable. If you're starting to feel sleepy by the end of the meal, the bill would wake you up. Adding the drinks, truffle supplement, and taxes, it can come to a large amount. But a dinner here is a special occasion, and the important thing is that you do feel it's worth the price
2
Went here while on honeymoon as a treat. The staff were lovely. So friendly and couldn't do enough to help you and service was excellent. However, the actual food wasn't that nice, in my opinion. Each dish was elaborately presented with a story behind, but the actual taste of the food was either bland or just odd. Disappointing especially for the expense of the meal. Had a much tastier meal the next night in a much more reasonably priced restaurant and with less of the pretence
5
We visited Restaurant Andre for our wedding anniversary. It was a superb upscale experience that we both enjoyed! It is located conveniently within walking distance of Outram Park MRT. It is a very elegant restaurant that serves many designer courses created by Chef Andre. We were greeted at the door and given water while we waited for our table. It wasn't long and we were seated. The staff are really professional, friendly and attentive. They even catered to our dietary limitations with ease. The restaurant is truly an experience in fine French-Asian style dining. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a top restaurant in Asia for that very special occasion. It is very popular so you will have to book well in advance with a deposit
5
We have been to many fine Michelin restaurants and I do believe this is one of the finest. The food is beyond amazing and creative but not overdone. The Octo Philosophy is well though out and delivered with outstanding service. The snacking was incredible and the courses all beyond tasty and imaginative. The beef cooked in a pot with coffee beans, the black bread and the burata dessert were some of the favorites but again every dish was amazing. This is a must for anyone who wants to taste probably the best in the world
5
Almost a year ago, i had the most exquisite dinner of my life. Chef Andre it's an artist. His food is made with passion, and with lots of generosity.He enjoy to feel amazement in his client eyes. He enjoys to cook for others and surprise them , play with them, making a story of the food he serves, taking you into a sensorial space of molecular gastronomy.Today , cleaning my house i found the menu he cooked for me and my boyfriend that evening, and i really feel nostalgic.Thank you! ❤

Dear Pam and Andre,We would like to graciously thank you for a evening that we will not forget. From the minute we walked in we were greeted and made to feel at home. It was so nice to walk by the kitchen and see all the chefs at work creating our mind blowing, taste bud tantalizing and sensory excitement meal. The craftsmanship that went into creating each dish was one of a kind. The attention to deal both esthetically and tasting was a masterpiece. To make the night even better was Jeremy's engagement proposal. We will forever hold the entire night in our hearts. We hope to visit again if ever in Singapore. PS. I could only post 10 out of the 27 courses we had. With gratitude,Annie and Jerem

We love fine dining every so often and have eaten in some great restaurants around the world. Andre was one of them.We visited Andre on a Saturday night. The restaurant can cater for 30 people over two levels. The service was superb. The staff spoke multiple languages including Korean, mandarin and French which was useful for the reasonably large number of guests from out of town. They were very hard working and efficient but kept smiling and were excellent. The meal was large - about three starters, eight courses with various themes and a few desserts and petit fours. We were very full. The menu was well explained. Reasonably a priced wine tasting option was also available - the wine offered was French bio/organic and actually very interesting. Andre also greeted all the guests. It was a long night - we arrived at 1900 and left at 2315 but was very enjoyable. Whilst not cheap, it was worth it. It deserves its rating on the San Pellegrino list.

This was my second visit to Andre, Although both experiences were similar this one was just that bit less enjoyable. The service was very good, slick and well informed waiters, lovely decor in the dining room and a very pleasant atmosphere. The only drawback, and it did detract from the evening was that the menu was incredibly seafood heavy up until the very end. My wife is a big fan of fish in general and by about course number five was craving something else, for me the meal was rescued somewhat by the incredible beef near the end, but it was a bit disappointing up to that point. In addition, a lot of the flavours were quite subtle, which isn't so much to my tastes.On the upside, the techniques displayed are truly impressive, we've eaten in some wonderful restaurants, and I genuinely don't think there's anywhere I have been where the food is cooked and presented so perfectly, I just wish it had a little more flavour and meat! They are also very good at catering to dietary requirements, just best to notify them in advance if possible

Great food. Perfectly prepared and presented. Unique flavours and textures. So a different and entertaining food journey. Somehow the hours just passed by. Only area for improvement was the wine pairings, which were certainly interesting and varied, but perhaps too unusual for my taste.
5
I've been to many Michelin-starred restaurants in Europe and Japan. My experience at Andre was one of the best I've ever had. Perfect food presentation, taste and service. Chef Andre is clearly a genius in his field!
5
Tonight's meal was by far the best meal that I've ever had, 28 courses of perfection topped off with the friendliest service on the planet!!!
5
One of the best place in Singapore.one of the best chef in the world.tnx for the one of the best visit in my life
5
Went for the lunch menu which they do twice a week(wed and fri). We had the rich and poor, land and sea, salty and sweet menu. They change the menu regularly. It was an excellent combination of flavours, textures and presentation. Paired it with Loire valley Sauvignon blanc. If you are in Singapore and want to taste something unique, do make the effort to book and go here.

The execution and plating of each dish was well thought through and articulated by the service staff. Each dish came with an element of surprise, either with the pairing of food or tehcnique. For example, the dish of beef tongue was paired with pickled butternut squash and complemented with warm foie gras soup. Resulting in a delightful combination of texture and taste. The main dish of poulet de Bresse encapsulated the concept of sous vide done in a traditional chinese method with the use of lotus leaves and "clay chicken" style. The accompanying spring onion and egg noodles went very well with the succulent chicken breast. The only minuses were cancellation of reservation ahead of checking with the diners if they have known a deposit was a pre- requisite. The espresso served was too acidic and served without an espresso spoon. When the sugar was served, another request for the spoon had to be made. Another order of latte was served with stains on the cup. Chef Andre was affable and enthusiastic in interacting with the diners and offer insights on why the food were prepared as such. An overall fantastic experience. Worthwhile to return!

We had lunch at the restaurant on 18th August. I was happy the chef was able to accommodate our dietary requirements yet with the crowned glory of being no. 3 best restaurant in Asia and earned 2 star in the michelin guide, we had high hopes. The chef's octaphilosophy was not working harmoniously, in my opinion. The choice of ingredients, taste and textures in each dish seemed to be running in different and senseless directions. We always enjoy food and wine. The restaurant wine list was hopeless, which was not hard to imagine with the type of dishes the chef serves. And hence the sommelier was glueless and looked unprofessional. Don't waste your time and money.
4
The service here is impeccable. The menu is artistic and innovative, with French and Japanese influences. We had the wine pairing with the fixed menu.This is a great place for a very special occasion. Highly recommend! Be ready for the bill; not for the faint-hearted. But well worth it for that special night, and the food delivers, even exceeds expectations in terms of taste and presentation
5
By shaI had the pleasure of dining at Andre on our recent stopover on honeymoon in August. We had been to this restaurant before (two years prior) but had been watching it climb the world rankings from Australia. We had an amazing time there two years ago and going back I was expecting…….i don’t know what I was expecting but I didn’t think it could top that meal.How wrong I wasSomehow they have gone to the next gear. The food, the balance, the intricacy of the presentation and just the experience left me speechless. Chef Andre and his entire team are truly special people working in a truly special place. All I can say is if you like fine dining or want to experience something out of this world then go. It is worth every dollar! Every course leaves you hanging for the next. The balance throughout the whole menu is amazing. and if you are really lucky (or just ask nicely like I did) the man himself will emerge. It’s funny you see these big name celebrity chefs and at times, the attitude and arrogance that goes with it. If I could cook that well I am sure I would be similar! But he is such a humble guy and you can see the belief he has in his team and his project. All the best of luck to him and hopefully a top 10 spot one day! ring your experiences, you're helping travellers make better choices and plan their dream trips. Thank you

Me and my wife visited Andre for what was booked as an 8 course degustation menu but in reality we were provided with at least twice that number of courses!First of all, the setting. Andre is located in a quaint little building just away from the hustle-and-bustle of the main bar and food area of Chinatown. At first glance it is not obvious that it is a restaurant and you have to search for a sign to check that you're in the right place. The restaurant itself is spread across 2-3 floors each with only a handful of tables which really makes it feel like an intimate, private dining experience. The decor is simple but not too much so, and there are several displays and adornments that provide intrigue throughout the meal. This includes a number of works by the head chef, Andre (of course), such as clay works of vegetables and old Michelin guides (evidence of a long student of the art).Onto the food, which obviously should be and was the star of the show. I mentioned that our 8 courses turned into much more as they brought numerous little treats both before we had started and mixed among the courses. For example, the 8th course was the dessert but that was really 3 courses with a "pre-dessert" and a "post-dessert". This gives you a small insight into the playfulness that Andre adds to the occasion. The menu tended to lean towards seafood and, despite that not really being a favourite for me, I enjoyed every one (only the oyster was a little too much for me). The highlights were a small duck-egg centre inside an orange cracker (this was only a side note of a larger set, but it was excellent) and a couple of the pre/normal/post dessert rounds - one with sliced grape and a fruity casing and another a set of "raw" cake mix ingredients which you mix yourself before eating. I wont spoil the surprise by explaining the latter any further.The service is impeccable, among the best I have witnessed at a Michelin starred restaurant. What I think they really got right was a nice balance between being formal, courteous and professional whilst retaining an open and friendly edge. They were prepared to imprint their personality on things, lighten the mood with a little joke and some casual conversation etc. This was really nice as often these places can be a bit too stuffy and up tight. At the end of the meal they recommended a nearby bar for cocktails, booked us a table and personally escorted us to the premises.For me, what really sets the two/three-star restaurants from the one-star is all the extra stuff. Good food has to be a given but its all the extras that make the difference. The service, the extra treats, the concept of the 8 points of his philosophy which the menu is based around, the fact that the wine list is like a bible and something you could take home and read for the evening etc. You can't tell a restaurant what they should do like this as the quality is in their uniqueness - but Andre gets it exactly right.Just to top things off, Andre himself made a tour of the tables at the end of the service and spent a few minutes talking to us about his menu and some of the thinking behind particular dishes. We took a copy of his book which he kindly signed and added a personal note which was a good touch.I'd certainly recommend anybody in Singapore making a trip to Andre. Its not one for every week, but its one for every now and then as a treat and I hope to be back someday

love this place, chef andre is creative and his creations are very tasty. this is definitely one of the best restaurants to eat at!
5
Undoubtedly the best food I have eaten in Singapore. This is not a cheap place so please plan only for special occassions.I had the 5 course lunch (dinner is a 7-8 course meal and double the cost!) and it was the best seafood I have had in Asia (except Japan). The menu changes daily / weekly and even on the same day people on different tables might end up eating different stuff so not going into the details of what I ate. The food and service was excellent. They have a great wine collection and I had a really really good Reisling there which they sourced directly from the vineyard (not sold to the public). Have an early breakfast and go if you are planning on lunch and please book a few weeks in advance
5
Don't understand how this isn't 1st place. I have dined my way around the world a bit and have never experienced so many elements in one sitting. French and Japanese techniques and delicateness seemed prevalent before I read up on his bio and was surprised he's of neither origin. The intensity of flavors I used to think can only be found in Spain; surprising boldness; innovation you only get from top chefs; it's a meal around the world in one place. Now, that's impressive. The salt dish was particularly memorable. My first taste was ohh this is salty, then realized it was composed entirely without salt. This isn't just great food we can say about many places, it's tasting the success of endless research and experimentation, the tipping point of clocking over 10k hours to achieve
5
I believe this restaurant has been covered but just to add forget the cost and enjoy the experience, service and food.The reviews we read are accurate describing the eating and sitting experience at this cool joint in Chinatown.The staff are wonderful and know their trade.Most are well travelled like us and are not over attentive.They explain the dish and let you get on with giving the taste buds an unusual Jacuzzi food adventure.Some of the wee morsels on the many plates provided, gave you a want for more. They are so good.There were one or two items not for our taste but that might not follow for others.I would go back in a flash next time in Singapore
5
The fact you must book two months in advance is testament to the experience. From start to finish each course is sure to amaze. Each course is carefully explained and how it fits with Chef André's culinary philosophy - "Octophilosophy". The wine pairing is intriguing and has you guessing about the wine type. A special restaurant to celebrate special events. Highly recommend
5
I struggle to adequately explain this food experience. It was beyond amazing. I booked well in advance and prior to the Michelin star announcement. The restaurant is stunning, from the entrance to the table. It's intimate and luxurious. The chefs wife served us throughout the evening and is clearly passionate about the food and philosophy. With good reason...This is a blind tasting menu, with things explained as you go. This lead to excitement and anticipation. The journey is week constructed, theatrical and artistic, but above all, the food is phenomenal. I appreciated that many of the first courses could be eaten by hand, the pretension felt dropped, this was about the food. We opted for the wine tasting and found the sommelier to be the best we have experienced in Singapore. The wines were initially served blind in response to the menu, he would return to explain the wine towards the end. Nice touch. The pairing worked and were generous in serving size. We were introduced to the kitchen team in the way out. Clearly they are very proud of what they do and with good reason. Of note, the staff are quite humble and entertaining, engaging in a joke and a laugh at times - love this!This restaurant is on the return list.
5
Outstanding!The best service I have ever encountered. Incredible food and worthy of the expensive price tag.Two dishes in particular a beef tongue, with pickled butternut squash and foie gras soup and the baked chicken with some kind of egg yolk spaghetti were the best I have ever had in any 1, 2 or 3* restaurant.The waiting staff, including being served by Andre's wife, were exceptional.I would recommend this for anyone after a special treat and apparently dinner is much better - not sure how
5
Was one of the lucky once to get a table at Andre, what a experience from the moment you walk-in the perfection starts, the staff very professional and Khun Pueng what a extraordinary host, unfortunate can't remember the sommeliers name a true professional.The menu was full of surprises and diversity every course and dish had his own character and the wine served along was a spot on match. You ever have the chance to get a table, grab't and enjoy
5
I have been lucky enough to eat in some of the top restaurants all over the world. Restaurants Andre is one of the best. If you are serious about going and you are a legitimate foodie then you know it's going to cost you a pretty penny but it's worth every cent. From the moment you step into the modern French inspired bistro you know you are somewhere special. The small vineyard focused wine list is impressive to say the least. If you don't have an understanding of French wine the team are more then happy to assist. The service is what you would expect from a top restaurant with a friendly twist. Some fine dining establishments can feel to clinical restaurant Andre has spirit. Let's face it you go for the food and the food does not disappoint. My partner and I bought into what Andre stands for. Not only is his food delicious but it makes you think it makes you ponder. His take on sustainability and fine dining is rare and if you have the time a must try in Singapore. Worth the plane trip if you are not a local.
5
Incredible food, great wine, and even interacted with Chef André Chiang himself! Restaurant André is truly exceptional—Impeccable service throughout the evening, paired with extraordinary cuisine, each plate demonstrating a high level of creativity and finesse. We even had a tour of Chef André's office and the kitchen, making the experience more personal and unique. This will be a meal to be remembered for years to come. JUST AMAZING! Worth a visit definitely. Book in advance
5
Number 32 in the world for a reason! A unique fine dining experience with food created by a genius. The restaurant and service are world class.
5
My husband and I booked here for a celebratory meal on our honeymoon. Amazing. The food is excellent, as you would expect. The service is a perfect mix of professional, knowledgeable and friendly.
5
Chef Andre is like a Willy Wonka for food lovers. Each site and each bite will surprise and delight you. I will not try and describe or explain what his food is about. That's a whole philosophical essay! The respect he has for ingredients, his capacity to find the purest and best ingredients then combine them in the most delicate ways have made his restaurant one of my favourite places on earth. A must go to restaurant if you're in Singapore. I intentionally haven't posted pics of the dishes as I do not wish to spoil your surprise. But one thing i can recommend is the tea
4
Went to Andre to celebrate Hubby's birthday. Every dish is very well executed and well thought. Upon the second last dish, the waiter placed a candle onto the rashberry desert with a little musical box playing the "happy birthday tune". Definite a great place to celebrate that special occasion. Will be back soon
5
Restaurant Andre is one of the Asian top 50. I was lucky enough to dine twice here. Both time was more than a year apart and both time was excellent. The food and preparation that goes into the food is insane. I've dined quite a Michelin star/ fine dining places around the world, Chef Andre's food is more memorable than the others.If you could spend the money, make sure you come here but make your reservations months in advance
5
Restaurant Andre is #3 in the Asia Top 50Restaurants and it deserves the place if not a better position.The restaurant is housed in a small house as the chef always wished for. We were lucky and managed to get dinner coz someone else cancelled. Only 30 tables with no changes so places are limited. We spent 3 hours at the restaurant for dinner.The service was excellent from the minute we stepped in till the end. Friendly with attention to detail. The ambience is very good warm, each dish is well explained and the food is amazing. We had the octophilosophy which started with 3 complimentary amouse Bouche -Followed by the 8 dishes and another 3 dishes for desert. Can't stress how good the food was - the taste and flavors perfect which for me makes it the best restaurant I've been so far.A nice touch is that the chef comes and speak to you as well and interested to know of your experience.
5
Restaurant André is the #3 rated best restaurant in Asia. You may be skeptical when you know that this restaurant is in China Town district but in fact it is beautifully located in a charming 4 story house. I was seated at the third floor which is a library style. Simple and elegant decor. Very warm, welcoming, professional and friendly staff. Service is 10/10. The dishes are creative and at the same time very tasty. Really enjoyed the dinner. It is a restaurant worth traveling to. I am aware that Narisawa in Tokyo is rated #2 in Asia but until I try that, Andrè in my opinion is #
5
The place is so popular it was full house on a Friday afternoon. Of course we booked in advance! Expectations were high and the food over-delivered in terms of presentation, creativity and taste. The wine pairing was more adventurous than you would normally get in Singapore and that made it fun and added another dimension to the appreciation of the meal. The pouring size could have been a bit more generous, considering what we paid for for the pairing. Pricey, but definitely one of the best restaurants here

Went for dinner last night with 2 friends. First the waitress asked if anyone of us had any allergy or didn't want any particular type of food. I stated no cheese nor dairy products. My food turned out to be better than the few of my companions' dishes which had cheese. All the food were presented in an unusual and unique way; not all the dishes tasted great - some were good but the tastes were overpowering for a couple of dishes.For such a fine dining restaurant with only 7 tables on the 2nd floor, I was surprised by the below par service. Several times we had to remind the waitress to top up our water and wine. It was only towards the end of our meal that the waitress was attentive, and filled up our water glasses without being prompted.Overall a decent dinner experience but we were not very impressed
5
The restaurant is definitely the place to go for important celebrations. Fit for a wedding anniversary in every aspect. We were seated downstairs, close to the kitchen. The dining room is surrounded by beautiful wood paneling but no window. The dinner lasted a good three hours and the eight courses are all exquisitely prepared. The cooking technique is unbelievable. The service was spot on and not intrusive. Chef Andre even cooked the lamb in coffee and cacao at the table for us. He is such a friendly and welcoming guy. I can feel his presence the moment I stepped into the restaurant. We are treated with a special cake for the anniversary. All the special touches have made the evening very memorable
4
I reserved the restaurant for my daughter's birthday. The food is quite good and full of initiatives though lacking of WOW. What really surprised me is that you need to prepare at least 3 hours for a meal.
5
Brought my family there to celebrate my wife's birthday. I booked this over a month in advance as I have heard so many positive recommendations from friends and internet. The place is rather non descriptive but has a private dining room sort of feel. Service is as expected excellent.The food - it's just so amazing. You can just tell how clever the chef must be to come up with courses after courses of delightful dishes. We loved the squid ink bread (mixed in with real charcoal so don't pick the wrong one), the foie gras in a charwanmushi style (best dish of the night), wagyu beef grilled with coffee beans and the list could go on and on.My simple advise is book well ahead, turn up and be amazed. You won't regret parting the cash. It is really good
3
Went for lunch. I left thinking, this place is all about substance: everything was generally, very tasty, very clever, very well executed. But, you do leave wondering, where is the magic? That golden thread of wonder and awe and FUN you can't have merely by taunting a vegetarian guest with a dish nicknamed "Punishment", but that relies on effortless service (it was awkward at times with positioning of the plates been called out by senior servers to more junior staff and coffee orders being placed incorrectly, plus sometimes significant gaps between service of dishes - as we went with a big group with various dietary requirements this may have impacted it), surprising and sometimes flamboyant flavours (some dishes were perfectly executed but far, far too safe), and dare I say it cheeky wine top ups (at over 140 dollars for 4 wine pairings it doesn't make sense to go for that option otherwise as a glass is only around 30 dollars and thrice as full!). I will be back for dinner, hoping that lunch was just a preview of magic, but on this trip, there certainly was something amiss
5
There's no point complaining about the cost or comparing to a hawker centre as that's not the intention of a fine dining restaurant. Compare it to other fine dining restaurants in the region or even the world. Andre was a very enjoyable experience for my wife and I. Yes it is expensive but I almost expect it to be given the level of service, quality of ingredients and amazing dishes. But yes the food is spectacular and Andre even came round at the end of the meal to chat with all the tables. He wasn't arrogant or narcissistic as many of the chefs are these days. He was genuinely interested in what we thought of the meal and what we enjoyed. Andre puts on a show with his tasting menu that is both fun and clever. I was actually very full by the end and my wife was full before dessert but powered on like a trooper. I had a glass of red and white as I didn't feel like having the pairing. Both very nice and complemented the food. A thoroughly enjoyable experience and definitely a great place for a celebration. I now just need a new excuse for something to celebrate

If you think how many dinners you would have in your lifetime, Restaurant Andre is one of those meals that you will NEVER forget!Globally, degustation is on-trend, and many tend to be orientated to a protein each course. What’s unique about Restaurant Andre, is the array of Asian ingredients is dazzling (to micro-meticulous detail), and vegetables are re-imagined.I’m not a big eater, however there were so many dishes, not one or two, but many that despite being full … I could not, simply not, absolutely impossible, could not leave one morsel (it even incites the urge to “lick the plate” - OBVIOUSLY I did not !!!) They were so darn delicious, you want seconds!! And could another amazing dish, be exceeded by the following one? - yep it was!Each dish is so individual, plating was an art exhibition of food, and if you enjoy food to be curious, unique, and exquisite then this is the place to try!. The brain can trick you, with what you see and what you taste (could you imagine peas as a dessert?!?!?), and that said it was a complete mysterious and intriguing dining experience. Chef Andre has this incredible selection of ala’natural boutique organic non-alcoholic “brews” - a must try and finally an alternative to a mocktail! They should bottle this and sell commerically!What was really nice, was the intimate venue (converted shop house), and you get the opportunity to thank Chef Andre in person! The entire team - Chef & Mrs Andre, reservations, culinary team and dining team, configure like a global family, and that reflects with the par’excellence creativity & service. Enough raving! If I could give you the benefit of hinesite, do not hesitate to pay/save for the experience - it is exceptionally special - treat yourself!This has been the highlight of our stay in Singapore, and only situated here you will have these unique ingredients and culinary flavours
5
Everything is well orchestrate ,from the setting,chinaware ,decoration ,menu ,all that has been well planed and designed by Pam and Andre ,Perfect combination .Food is cooked at perfection with attention to details and research for presentation and flavour .wines are all organic and out of the normal selections that you find in Singapore ..of course that come with a price ...great and efficient service with all the right explanation ,of course you can feel that Pam is the maitresse de Maison and manage well very details and the rest of the team. Great venue for Singapore if you are looking for something out of the normal eating part and cook at perfection however be ready as that come at a price due to the large number of fine imported products

I've been lucky to try a few of the highly rated restaurants around the world. I've usually walked away thinking "that was nice" but not quite sure what all the fuss was about. Happy to have experienced it, but unlikely to return. This is not the case with Restaurant Andre. I've never walked away from a dinner feeling so impressed by the imagination and skill of the chef. I love unexpected combinations of ingredients that deliver delightful taste experiences. Chef Andre has mastered complex culinary techniques that showcase even the simplest ingredient. The sheer range of techniques used in the degustation menu is impressive and really makes you feel this is a wonderful dining experience. The imagination and harmony in the ingredient combinations is unique. New tastes are invented here. The environment is sophisticated, yet homely. The service is attentive and friendly. The homely ambiance is enhanced when Chef Andre comes out to talk with his patrons after the service is complete. It is almost like you are having dinner at his house. He is warm and engaging and you can tell the enthusiasm and love he has from what he does not just from the food, but also the way he talks about food. The most memorable and enjoyable dining experience I've had. I can't wait to come back for more
5
The food is excellent and highly imaginative. The service is immaculate, although I struggled to understand some of the servers as English wasn't their first language. Husband and wife team work great together. Make sure to book well in advance as it not a huge restaurant. We got to see the kitchen on our way out, which was a nice touch. Also, Chef Andrè came to the table to personally talk to the diners which was highly appreciated. His wife personally walked us out to the train station which is a good 5-mins walk away.It is expensive but it is well worth the experience. It is without a doubt the best meal experience I ever had in the many years I have been visiting Singapore
5
We went here on our honeymoon and had an amazing dinner. Although neither of us are fans of the degustation menu concept, this was different. The food was outstanding (be aware there is A LOT of food) and service exceeded our expectations. We had a 3-4 hour dinner and were never rushed. Somehow they knew it was my birthday and even made us a small cake to take away. The wine pairing option is great but the wines are not expensive wines but they are charged at a very high fare. Dinner was $1300+ USD which is extremely expensive. To have customers return they need to think of an alternative as I'm not sure I would justify spending that on a dinner for two every time we visit Singapore but it was definitely worth it as a one off.
5
Being the foodie that I am, and seeing Andre chalk up award after award over the past few years, I knew I had to visit and fortunately that time came in February for my birthday. The restaurant is tucked away on Bukit Pasoh Road, close to Singapore's other gastronomic hotspots of Keong Saik Road and the Duxton Hill area. The restaurant is in a gorgeous three story colonial styled shophouse and beautifully renovated on the inside with a nice modern decor. Andre's menu concept of "Octaphilosophy" is both whimsical and sophisticated with a certain depth of flavors to each of the dishes that I -quite frankly- have never before experienced. Everything flows together in harmony as he takes you on a journey through his philosophy on food. Particular standout dishes from our evening was the Saga beef, the corn soup (superb textures) and the foie gras mousse / jelly which is one of his signature dishes. It was all superb; perfectly balanced and flawlessly executed.Some of the more playful dishes were the truffle "risotto" (there's some slight-of-hand involved in this dish; I won't spoil it here!) and the dessert course which looked like raw ingredients to make a cake but were actually something else entirely. Service here is top notch. Andre's wife Pam and their team took exceptionally good care of us on our journey into "Octaphilosophy" and made the meal truly memorable and enjoyable. And since it was my birthday, I had a wonderful card signed by everyone from the restaurant at the end! Andre is also an extremely humble and gracious chef who came out of the kitchen to mingle with each of the guests. We had a lot of fun talking to him and his wife Pam about food.A truly fantastic once in a lifetime experience. It's easy to see why this restaurant is widely regarded as Singapore's best restaurant. We look forward to returning and highly recommend Restaurant Andre to anyone that is looking for a truly unique and memorable experience
5
Waiting for few months to go there but it was worth to wait. Food was exquisite, every dishes were astonished and their staff was so attentive. It was such a great experience and definitely will go again.
5
There is no much to say, I just love it. Excellent fine dining experience. The food and service were outstanding.
5
I wanted to make a surprise for my fiancee,making a reservation for the New Year's Eve evening,and it was the best decision ever.
First of all,the reservation procces,made with one month in advance,was easy and with no problems.
5
Very warm services with beyond amazing food. Thanks Chef Andre and his Wife for brining us such a memorable evening. Loved every single dish especially the risotto.
5
This is the most wonderful dinning experience in my life. Not just the food, it is an experience that you SHOULDN'T miss in this life. Its an art piece, a high quality food, extraordinary presentation, smooth switching the palate from salary to sweet taste, super efficient service that made this dinning experience unforgettable.... I met Chef Andre and got his signature on his book ! Wow Wow Wow
5
We had lunch at Andre's, it was one of the most memorable lunches I've ever had, from the champagne from select French vineyards to the exquisitely presented courses on plates designed by Andre himself. It's somewhere you do to be impressed, you pay accordingly but what a superb way to enjoy the finest French food in Singapore. A must do restaurant
5
You can only have Set Menu, but every course is a highlight. The flavours, the presentation just amazing. you get several 'small' starters before the actually menu and two pre desserts. Which at the end of the night is, at least for me, to much. We struggled with the last 3 dishes which is a shame as you not enjoying it anymore as you should.Service is as well outstanding and the beautiful wine menu is an art by it self.So a must to go, if you are willing to spend for the menu and wine paring over a 1'000, US$ for 2 person
5
We went for dinner with friends for a birthday and it was absolutely amazing.The service was very attentive, the food incredible and the atmosphere very elegant yet fun.The 8-course menu which probably ends up being around 15 courses if you count every single "dish" was the best I have ever had. The effort that went into every dish, the incredible taste and textures were mind blowing.We took the option of wine-pairing and would definitely recommend it as well.It is extremely pricey but if you have a chance to do it, you don't need to think twice and will not regret it

I went to Andre when it first opened in 2010, and at the time I thought it was an excellent restaurant. A lot of restaurants in Singapore are consistently excellent, but very few are creative or outstanding, and I found this to be one of them. Andre himself conducted us through the kitchen, and we were very impressed, even down to the bread.We then skipped Andre for a good 5 years, returning in 2015. Not consciously; it just never crossed my mind that we should return.The food remains outstanding, and the amount is definitely generous for a restaurant of this price range - we were struggling halfway through to keep eating. It's still one of the best restaurants around, food-wise, and Michelin accolades are surely forthcoming.But the price has reached a point of heavily diminishing returns - plenty of food can be had in Singapore that is at worst infinitesimally inferior for infinitely cheaper. Don't get me wrong, I rarely scrimp on food; but it has gotten to that point. The service, while attentive, also borders on pretentious now, which is a real pity. We didn't see Andre at all this time too.I don't regret going. But I also don't regret the 5 year wait. We will wait 5 more years to return

Our last visit to Restaurant Andre was already a gastronomic delight with excellent food and perfect wine all served by friendly and knowledgeable staff. Can they improve on perfection? They certainly can and have! We were not disappointed. Andre's food is fun and a pleasure to look at and even more interesting to eat. Restaurant Andre has become our go to restaurant in Singapore and whose standards other restaurants will find very hard to emulate or overtake. Slightly pricey but worth it. We have also discovered lunch is more relaxed and can be tied in with a visit to Chinatown. Reservation essential.

Had read a lot about the restaurant online and it lived upto every expectation we had. Went for my wife's birthday and course after course of mesmerising food came our way. Hard to fault anything that came our way!

An acclaimed, renowned establishment that embodies Chef Andre Chiang's culinary philosophy. Calling it a "restaurant" just won't do it justice.

Was recommended to Restaurant Andre by a friend who is studying in culinary school. Having visited, I can now understand why a meal here is not just dining, but an experience in itself. The restaurant has a little card on the table with ingredients (some very mysterious sounding) listed; and as they serve each dish, you feel a combination of intrigue, bewilderment and delight as you taste and discover what the chef has incorporated into your meal.Standout dishes for my husband and I were Chef's take on fish and chips (we devoured everything including the garlic chocolate soil), squid risotto and the DIY cake for dessert.Not just instagram and photo-worthy, but really a lovely treat if you would like to celebrate a special occassion (it is very pricey). You will definitely remember this meal for years to come!

Well.....my best food journey ever. Restaurant Andre deserved all the awards they were getting and guess it will never stop in the future.It started the moment I got the confirmed reservation.Hayley the Guest Relation Manager will ask what is our food preference or is there any special occasion.On the night, we were warmly greeted in front of the restaurant and were shown to our table at Level 2. Perfectly nice table back facing the window. A lovely and intimate interior made a good impression.We were greeted by Sofie, korean waitress who is very cheerful and welcoming us with some introduction about the dishes we will be having.We were also served by Nikki, Roma (the wine sommelier) and Pam.The food journey started with the pre snack consist of 8 different items. Each dishes are absolutely beautiful presented with so many details.Then we started our Octaphilosophy Set Dinner, where each course is presented Absolutely beautiful, the server will explain the philosophy behind the dish, even some with short history and some unexpected trick to guess the food we had.Amazing experience as what you think you see and taste might not be what you thought of. After the set menu, we had 2 pre-desserts which were a transition dish from Savory pallet before the dessert. Finally, the dessert came with 7 different items.We were greeted by the Chef Andre himself who is a very humble and passionate person and the opportunity to met the team in the kitchen.I have to say 3.5 hours spent in that evening was an interesting and absolutely best food journey ever

I would call myself a foodie and this is one of the best restaurants I have ever been to. The food, presentation, and creativity was amazing. We went for lunch and while not inexpensive, it was well worth it. I highly recommend this chef.BTW, the chef also comes out to autograph menus and he is so friendly that he allows pix with him. I know we will definitely hear more and more about Andre Chiang -- he is amazing. A must try!!
5
Andre has earned the top 5 restaurants in Asia and 37 best restaurants in the world. I have been to at least 10 of the 50 best, and I like it the best. Main reason is that when Andre is open, Andre Chaing is doing the cooking. We meet him and his lovely wife.Reservation is hard to get and using e-mail is best to get a reservation, since the restaurant is quite small. We were able to get into Wednesday lunch, only day they open for lunch for their 6 courses menu. Lunch cost is quite a bit cheaper than dinner. We loved the mushroom duxelles salad, as well as their fish dish, (local catch) and the slow roasted quinoa short rib, was so good and rich. Total cost with meal with wine/tax/service was 200 Singapore dollars. It was well worth it. We even got a picture with the great chef. So it is a much d

Their dishes were pretty beautiful but tasted complicated and added too much seasoning. We ordered the same drink with people who next to us but our drink seems less some decoration than others. We asked a Korean waitress why our drink was different to others then she told me that she will ask the staff in the kitchen. She never responded to my question and kept avoiding any eye-contact with me since then. Totally not worth the money that we've paid
5
Our family of four went for lunch (more affordable) at Restaurant Andre, regarded as one of the best fine dining restaurants in Singapore. We think it is the finest as we had a wow factor, considering that we are foodie and visiting michelin star restaurants is our holiday itinerary. It is an aesthetic experience. Every dish was beautifully presented like an aesthetic journey. The ingredients used were unique like lamb from Wales and fish from Spain. The service was great, not to mention that at the end of the lunch, Andre Chiang, such an accomplished master chef, chatted with the guests at every table. On our way to the exit, we walked past the kitchen and were greeted by the entire crew. We were pampered
5
Brilliant food although we struggled to eat the full menu, although we were there for the eight course degustation menu there were another five smaller plates. The menu highlighted Andre Chiang's time in France especially his signature dish with the warm foie gras jelly with black truffle coulis
5
One of the best foodie experiences! Intimate location, amazing customer service and breathtaking food! No menu just really informed staff, plenty of fun and theatre. They really looked after us and catered for all kinds of dietary requirements. The chef came out to speak to all tables at the end of service which was a lovely touch and his wife was front of house and was such a pleasure to speak to during the night. Fantastic attention to detail, we'll definitely be back
4
Foods are incrediblely good and the service is 5 star. The sad thing is that we were not greeted by the head chef like other tables were.
5
Our first time at Restaurant Andre - excellent food and excellent service. The wines are rare and great. A must-go for any foodie in Singapore!
5
Proud of this Taiwanese chef! Food quality and presentation are both terrific! It's a cute place to dine, I especially like their restroom lol
They will also give you a tour after you finish, it made you feel very personal ! Strongly recommend !!!
5
Very intimate restaurant serving at most 20 to 25 guests from a tiny kitchen and very personalized service. Two chefs tables near the kitchen for more people than just couples and couples take on the first floor. Incredibly refined cuisine. No menu but just the chef's creations of the moment, however taking care of any special dietary requirements. Succession of very tasty and creative dishes around a theme of flavors. Incredible dishes from the foie gras mousse (the chef's classic) to abalone and creative desserts. Wine menu is however very limited to a handful of Selected French wines. Definitely one of the best French restaurant in Singapore.... which comes with its price tag.
5
From the very moment you step past the signature olive tree, you are greeted with a warm welcome by one of their staff members. You are shown to a waiting area whilst they re-confirm your reservation and if everything is in order, you are quickly whisked away to your table.We were greeted by friendly staff as we proceeded through the restaurant, made our way up to the third floor via a private elevator, and seated at a corner table beside Chef André's vast collection of culinary books. Our waiter for the night (which we did not get the name for, but we know he's from Germany) proceeded to explain the vision of Chef Andre through his octaphilopsophy, keeping the mood light with some well placed jokes. We were also pleasantly surprised to learn that our menu would be altered for a Christmas special.Our server also re-confirmed our dietary restrictions, and when informed that my partner was allergic to alcohol, proceeded to recommend us a wonderful juice pairing, personalised to suit our tastes as well as compliment the dishes.We were served a total of 7 finger snacks, 8 courses and 5 desserts (We had to skip the tea). Each dish that was served came accompanied with a description of the dish, very well articulated by our server for the evening.During the course of the meal, food never came to your table if you were away from it (to use the bathroom, or if you were taking in the view from the balcony). Servers would wait with the dishes until you were comfortably seated before serving the dish to both you and your partner. Everything was fine-tuned to an impeccable amount of detail. You truly felt like their most important guest.After the last dessert is served, you are then greeted by Chef André himself, who makes it a point to get personal with his customers. Truly for a restaurant which promotes homeliness and eleagance together, Restaurant André lives up to its name.This was one of the more memorable dinners I've had the pleasure of having. I will definitely be returning to Restaurant André in the future
5
This was my second time back to the restaurant and I was excited to see what Chef Andre had in store for usEchoing other reviewers, pleasant journey through his Octaphilosophy, loved the balance on the dishes, loved the progression and each dish was distinct and unique bringing out a sensory experience where we could relate to the main ingredients - dishes that tasted like the sea, the smell of the rustic cornfields. It was quite the experience and Chef Andre did not disappoint. Service continues to be lively, interactive, lighthearted and serious if need be. One of the best teams I've seen at restaurants in Singapore. It's good to know this restaurant can help elevate our reputation in the international gourmet realm! It's always pleasant to have the chef check in with the diners, and Chef Andre does this without fail. You can tell he takes pride in his food and his restaurant which reflects and feeds through to the rest of his team.
5
Restaurant Andre offered a gastronomy experience that was complete and substantiated. Each course that was carefully crafted to push boundaries of the palate yet all of it was thoroughly grounded allowing any common man to simply savor. The effort did not stop short at the dishes served but was further brought to life by every interaction of the service staff. Each one was confident and warm in their delivery, even adding refreshing drops of humor in presentation. One need not worry of falling on the side of a pretentious and rigid dining experience. Instead you truly feel the warmth of a home; of course with its touch of class. The Sommelier offered phenomenal wine pairing. Educating but not dictating the comprehension of each carefully selected wine. To top it off, having Chef Andre himself speak to all the guests would make anyone feel valued. Money truly well spent
4
We went here here for our wedding anniversary and they add a nice little touch by getting a special cake. The different courses were nice and competent. I cannot say that this is among my favourite French cuisine restaurants but in Singapore it is probably one of the best. You can only eat the menu though and not a la carte.Service is good and unobtrusive
5
I am a local boy but have never dine in all these prominent places but have dine mostly outside of Singapore. The basic reason fine dining in Singapore is way too expensive. This week I had the good fortune to dine at Les Amis, Igg's, Andre, Waku Ghin, and Odette solely because my annual France food and wine pilgrimage was cancelled due to the attacks.Wife had arrange all these local dining spots because it was my birthday week. The final overall recommendation from the list above will be Andre if I only had one last meal or just landed in Singapore from Mars. Andre is pretty well known in most French restaurants if you introduce yourself as from Singapore.As others have mentioned before, I like to reinforce these are the norm or 'house rules with better fine dining places that take credit card upon reservation, no show fees, dietary restrictions, dress code, no children policy etc, The reason being the limited number of seats (pace of food- kitchen output), long wait list (limited seats), and personalized set tasting menu (fresh produce), that the chef has to cater to each customer. Please get use to such house rules as we embark on Michelin fine dining in 2016.Chef's interaction with guests, that's the chef prerogative based on his schedule but this makes the main difference - a super fine dining experience (repeat customers) from a so-so fine dining (once a lifetime) is the chef rapport with the guests. A reputable Japanese chef once told me u can teach a sushi or teppanyaki chef how to prepare the food over many years but if the chef can't interact with the guests at the counter, half the battle is gone.The wait staff at Andre looks like an international team and able to handle the wide spectrum of clients base and looks amazing. The kitchen team was equally impressive and accolades to the team for the fine food.The price range between $150 lunch to $350 dinner (without drinks).The boutique wine list was comprehensive.The reason I don't discuss much about the food as others have covered it. Andre is a great chef and you know his food is of top quality. But I am a operations (maitre d) person and have dine enough around the world to know that what makes or break a superb restaurant (besides the chef) is the front staff. In this case, I feel at home. To me, that defines French cooking.Overall I enjoyed the food and dining experience at Andre and am planning for my return visit. Hopefully the prices do not go up with the number of Michelin stars they get. My guess would be 1 star for 2016 and 2 stars by 2017

Had my birthday dinner there a few months ago,Made a booking a month in advance with credit card details, which i understand when you know how many people don't turn up in restaurant in singapore.beautiful place, i like the setting, very kind and professional front of the house team.Went for the menu, no choice anyway, personally i had an great experience in term of food, even if there were a few dishes i didn't understand, didn't see the link between the ingredients, nevermind still happy in term of foodunfortunately we were completely ignore by the chef Andre, he's been to all the tables in the room except our. we felt like we were not worth in time.... Other really bad point for me was the wine list, truly interesting, only natural and organics wines,but the price wasn't natural, crazily OVERPRICE.Overall it was an experience but I will not go bac

I was went to andre restautant.. When im arrived there, server so very nice and friendly.. Service very good and nice.. They can explain the food very well.. The food very great tasted!!! Must try this restaurant if you in singapore!!!
5
Picasso of fine dining! Fantastic meal - worth the price, only think they forgot about my allergies however, they did remedy it after. Will def go back soon
5
Interesting boutique restaurant set up in a traditional shop house...amazing food presentation and taste of surprise and skills! We had 8-course dinner and countless appetizer.
5
I made reservation at least 2 months in advance to celebrate my husband's birthday - wisest decision ever.Reservation: $50 was charged to my cc if i wanna secure my reservation - very rare to have such practice in spore, even overseas! Nonetheless, i can understand since there's limited tables. Service: impeccable. Not snobbish and makes us feel all comfortable. The sommelier is great. I love how the paired wines are not introduced right at the start. He makes us taste and appreciate the wine instead of judging based on its "pedigree". The only (small) room for improvement is: we have some difficulty understanding the jap lady (plus point is, she is very enthusiastic) when explaining to usFood: after so many michelin-star clad restaurants tat we have tried, it is all about the "surprise" element. My husband is very impressed with the combination texture composition of each dish. Environment: casual yet elegant. You can feel that every piece of furniture is put together with thoughts.Alittle suggestion: if chef andre were to pay a visit to any table due to any reason- he should have at least say hello to each table's guests. I felt left out when he spent a good 5 mins with the table beside mine but walked past us just with a smile. (Hey, i wanted to compliment him for impressing us - although we aren't anyone famous)All in all, if we can afford, we would probably pop by pretty soon again.
5
The best in sg after trying waku Ghin, Le Amis etc . The Chef brings us through a journey and there's a story behind each food . Love the freshly baked bread too . Got a chance to say hi to the Chef n visit the kitchen. A must try for this restaurant.
5
Of course, with all these awards, you raise high expectations... The food experience lets me speechless, the only thing I can say is BRAVO. It is fantastic. With a full experience of a well know restaurant comes other things; - service - excellent; - atmosphere - good, but the comfy and nicely designed house did not compensate the lack of view.- wine; this is my disappointment from the night... We chose the champagne and wine pairing (5 glasses for 8 courses), all from organic south of France wine yards. I strongly believe that French wines are the best of the world, and I remain disappointed with the choice of the sommelier. If they were good, it was not half of they could have done to match the fabulous dishes.The bill remains extremely high, so I cannot skip the comment. Definitively one of the best restaurant I have even been, though..
5
This is by far the best restaurant we have ever dined in! The food was sensational, art on a plate that looks too good to eat, but with flavours that are just out of this world. The service is impeccable. It's not cheap but you certainly get what you pay for and more! The chocolate pudding was just incredible....what an amazing culinary dish! Can't wait to get back to Singapore to come again
5
The ingredients are superb. Pigeon from Bresse, goats curd from the Loire Valley, caviar from the Black Sea. All of a high quality. The artistry is beautiful, as is the presentation, flavours diverse and the whole ambience of the experience makes for a game of surprise. Restaurant Andre's reputation is well deserved.The wine list has wonderful,choices. Expect to pay from $30 per glass as a starting point and wines by the bottle run to the hundreds for beautiful selections.The staff are knowledgeable and helpful. Water is served as chosen. Still or sparkling. The charge for water per person is presently $20 per person, plus plus.The plus plus being service and GST.Here I have tried to be impartial. Without doubt this restaurant is a 'foodie's heaven.However ultimately I found the food too rich for my palate and during the various courses was starting to get heartburn. The last time I had heartburn was over 30 years ago and I was just about to give birth to daughter No 2. Heartburn is not normally a territory I visit is what I am trying to say. Though not visibly evident, there must have been ingredients that warranted my digestive system's acid attack. Beautiful flavours at the expense of discomfort for me.For dinner there are eight courses, described within the philosophy of Chef Andre. There are also additional courses included, three snacks prior, three desserts after and then some beautifully exhibited petits fours.In the end, it all got too much and I just wanted to go home. With so much rich rood, it was no longer a thrill a minute any more.A lot of good things are stated about Restaurant Andre, and deservedly so, but perhaps lunch with lesser number of courses and corresponding price tag, would be to best way to approach the experience here
5
AndrÃ© let you enjoy a journey through taste, flavours, textures - this is food pairing at its finest.It was such an experience - for all senses!!!The price is of course higher than other places, but with this quality and the top service you will not regret it
4
I had very high hopes since Andre is on the Top 100 World list and I've been making the rounds. The restaurant door did not open until the top of the hour, with a half dozen people waiting outside. The interior is nicely done and we were seated as the second table that night. Tasting menu selection, taste and presentation as outstanding. The biggest flaw was the pace of the service. Other tables that were seated after us were served various courses earlier than we and 3 left before us (and we are not slow eaters). It seemed a mystery who would get a course next. Three and a half hours is just a bit long for dinner, even with the number of courses. Another couple of restaurants in Singapore would be better choices - see Top 100
5
Truly worthy as one of the best restaurants in asia. Inventive cooking and flawless execution from amuse bouche all the way to dessert. Wine list was very special and reasonable. A must go to in singapore!
5
Andre's is the place to go for a special occasion to celebrate over a fantastic dining experience. One has to try the innovative and inspiring creations to understand Andre's Octophilosophy - a sensorial delight.
5
During our gourmettrip to southeastasia we enjoyed the excellent dinner with André Chang and his wife. Everything is just perfect and the atmosphere is quiet and elegant. Highly recommendable.
5
The food and service was faultless. A lot of the food I had never tried before so not for people who are fussy. I think we had about 15 courses in all so go hungry! We opted for the wine pairing- probably would opt for a bottle if we did it again. The waiters were very helpful- they would give background about the dishes before serving. We were also lucky enough to meet Andre the chef who came out at the end of the evening and spoke to different tables. Our waiter also showed us the kitchen and gave us recommendations for bars nearby after the meal. Very expensive but worth it for a once in a lifetime meal
5
Our wine pairing degustation menu for two costed sgd 1200 and it was worth every dollar. Service was immaculate. Our sommelier was one of the best that I've ever met--quick to identify taste and preference, very flexible with the pairing. Every dish was a piece of art on the table and party in the mouth. The purest taste of each ingredient presented. It's a dinner experience you will talk about and use as a benchmark for years to come
5
There is a reason André Chiang's Octaphilosophy restaurant is ranked 5th in the world - Michel Roux meets Heston Blumenthal ... with an Asian twist! One let down is wines are priced like Enoteca Pinchiorri (Florence - 3 Michelin stars) but can't boast the same 4,000+ vintage wine collection ...We were lucky enough to catch the last night of the restaurant celebrating it's 5 year anniversary. It coincides with Singapore's 50th Independence Birthday. What does André do with that? A menu of 10 dishes with 5 star ingredients in each. Clever even if not quite fitting with Octaphilosophy but the very attentive German restaurant manager set us straight - the savoury dishes are 8.The highlights of the dishes were the Almond Parfait, the Scallop Tortellini, Wild Fungs Risoni and DIY cake. Pictures of all the dishes and explanations enclosed.Our group had both the wine pairing as well as the tea pairing - yes you read correctly "tea" pairing. A bit different and worth a try but not sure we would do it again.Service was fabulous from the engaging and chatty (but the right amount and actually listening) German waiter, to the General Manager who attentively regulated the aircon and the lovely Malay waitress with the most infections smile. Decor was modern but minimalist and really well paired with the philosophy behind the food. A favourite were the black sheep which ladies used to perch their handbags.All-in-all an amazing experience with the food and service worth every penny. Not sure I could say the same about the wine (almost the same as food in terms of cost but to my mind not worth paying for wine advertised like beer) or the tea tasting even if more reasonably priced.Hats off the André and the team for what is a truly two Michelin star experience
5
It was not chip but worth it.An over 3 hour food experiance.Amazing taste and service.All was perfect.Come hungry as there is alot to eat and it all worth a taste.Price is not chip and we had a wine and a glass of champange.
5
Having arrived off an 11 hour flight yesterday, I thought I would have a nap in the afternoon to prepare myself for the Restaurant Andre experience. I then proceeded to sleep right through my alarm going off, only to wake up when my phone rang - it was Restaurant Andre phoning to ask where I was! Having paid a deposit I didn't want to miss out, and jumped in a taxi. I was 45 minutes late, but very grateful that they held my table. From then on the evening was wonderful. The food, the wine matches, the staff, were all perfect. It is just a pity it costs so much ;
5
I barely understood the introduction of a dish when the waiter spoke English. Yet they soon sent another waiter who spoke Chinese for me. They took really good care of the customers. Also, it was amazing that the waiter would show you the kitchen and took photos of you and the chef before you were leaving. That gave a wonderful ending of the meal. Thanks
5
The food was awesome, the wine perfect. It was really an experience, never had dinner like there before.But to be honest, I didn't know food could be that expensive. We paid for the menu with wine for two (no champagne or other extras) around 1000$, I'm not sure if it was worth it..
5
You must get the wine pairing with the devastation menu. It will literally blow your mind. Very intimate and exceptional service and attention to detail. A true gastronomic odyssey!
5
Be it for lunch or dinner, you can be assured of being surprised by the great service, amazing cuisine presented in the most astonishing ways. Along with these accolades, the food tastes amazing!
5
Yes, it takes deposit for reservation. Anyway, it worths. Personally, I don't think Singapore pooples are hospitable like other southeast countries but I do experience the 2 best restaraunts here not only for food but also for service. Both of them are French fine dinning. Andre is one of them. And I was so happy that I don't need to order food but just sitting there waiting for the surprises. Using fingers to eat the starters was the first suprise. The "DIY" desert was the last one which is full of fun
5
Wonderfully located at Bukit Pasoh's renovated old shop houses. The whole setting and cutlery are very classy and not pretentious or ostentatious. Food is exquisite - molecular type of construction. Very tasty and at times thought provoking. Service is first class - assured, discreet, friendly and knowledgeable all rolled into one
5
We went to Andre for our special night whilst in Singapore on our honeymoon. We had checked out the website and seen the amazing trailer on YouTube and were convinced it would be an experience not to forget - and this was completely true. The restaurant itself is intimate, well decorated and beautiful. The staff were helpful, well informed and thankfully not pretentious as you get sometimes in other high-class restaurants - we were made to feel very comfortable and suitably fussed over for our special event. As for the food, it was quite an experience. As well as eight main courses, there are a number of 'snacking' and dessert courses that contributed to our four hour meal. The food is beautifully presented as well as delicious. We had oysters, smoked eel and rabbit to name a few. Our dietary requirements (pescatarian) were catered for very well and it was an overall brilliant evening - made even more special by meeting Andre himself and given the opportunity to view the kitchen as we left! Although fairly expensive, it is definitely worth it, and we highly recommend Andre for a special night in Singapore
5
.......I will the next time I'm in Singapore. I was sick the night the family was going to treat me to dinner at André's (see another Singapore restaurant review) but my returning family made me extremely envious. Their fulsome description of what they had eaten combined with a photographic catalog of each beautiful dish served convinced me that Restaurant André belongs to the absolute top category of world restaurants.André is characterized by exceptional creativity and the dishes that are served are chosen as much for their visual appeal and taste as the freshness of the products (some of them unusual) used. The menu is dictated by André (however, with deference to allergies) and apparently changes daily dependent on what's available/takes the kitchen's fancy. Bottom line: this place is worth getting on a plane to Singapore for and top of my list for my next trip. Viator Coloniae
5
Worth the long wait! Ambience is totally different from what I expected, more on the cozy, less formal side but this doesn't stop their professionalism in wine choosing and chef andre's personal sharing his culinary experiences in the midst of our meals. His creative culinary artworks bring our taste buds to another gastronomic journey. His good ingredient simple combinations turns out superb taste and texture. Can't find any imperfection in his food art and only regret didn't make reservation for dinner instead. Saw the next table trying out the vegetarian menu, absolutely gorgeous plating too! Will try out the dinner next time round
5
Prior to my trip to Singapore I reviewed the Top 50 Restaurant list - http://www.theworlds50best.com and Andre came up, now number 46 on the list. So we had to eat there...It was absolutely marvelous! Pure delight as he masterfully crafts a visual and taste sensation with a few bold strokes and simple ingredients! I was so amazed at what he did with simple onions, an that is it! He brought out the bitter, sweet, shape notes in layers and it melted in my mouth! He composed a simple story, each chapter elevating a single ingredient until the finally...all accompanied with brilliant pairing of wine and liquors! The restaurant is located in Chinatown in an old 3 storey colonial storefront. Small quarters so it's rather intimate and cozy. The staff was great, very diligent and attentive, the Sommelier was a blast! She was fun to talk to and her opinions on wine and alcohol was hilarious, but spot on My suggest is JUST GO THERE next time you are in Singapore, it is an experience you will not forget
5
Went here on a sunday night - wasn't sure what to expect and I was pretty well blown away. This was an excellent meal. The menu is chosen for you - I did replace one of the courses. Everything was really first class. I chose the wine pairing - which was well presented by the sommelier. I wasn't sure what they all were, but they were explained well and some interesting choices. As others have commented - there is one that is very different. I liked it. In the end - the bill was some 600 Singapore Dollars. I thought that was relatively good value as the meal was first class.One nice touch, which I don't know if he does it all the time, but Chef Andre came out and sat with the diners for quite some time. That was nice. I will come back here on future visits to Singapore. If you look at my trip advisor reviews, I really have not had a lot of great luck with restaurants here. This one made up for a lot
5
Truly a great fine dining experience!!Usually I like to know what is on the degustation menu when I book the restaurant. However, I was told Chef Andre likes to surprise his guests. I decided to b brave for once because I have heard so many great reviews about Restaurant Andre. And being a Taiwanese myself, I had to go and try. I was truly surprised & amazed at the number of courses offered (ladies beware). With the taste of freshness n variety of good food from Japan to France to satisfy your taste buds. The presentation of each dish looked so good until I almost didn't want to ruin the masterpieces. The best was the DIY Cake. Definitely was a big surprise! You think you know what you r getting by what you see, but I was fantastically deceived & it is beyond this world. Exceptional service as expected in a fine dining restaurant, but the staff were humorous & so friendly, even Chef Andre chatted with us before we left. If you like good food, if you like surprises, you should definitely book a table (way in advance!

If you visited Singapore,you must come here. The food was amazing!
Highly recommend this fine dining experience for a wonderful romantic date or special celebration.
5
I enjoyed the dining experience at Andre. Each dish was creatively thought through and prepared with a clear attention to detail. I would recommend if you are looking for a long unique taste experience matched with top service. Highly recommended.
5
I was lucky to be invited to an amazing dining experience. Fantastic flavors. Definitely a must-try. Highly recommend this fine dining experience for a wonderful romantic date or special celebration.
5
every course just amaze me so much, the super delicious food come with full of creativity. its very joy to watch the display of every dish, and enjoy the taste of the food. the dinner is very worth to try if you visit Singapore. it rocks my world. will definitely come back here every time when i visit SG
5
located in a stylish renovated town house in chinatown, Andre takes your breath away as soon as you enter. very attentive staff and waiters welcome you right outside the entrance. over the next 3 hours, your taste buds will experience a roller coaster ride of gastronomic excellence and variety. this place is very pricey but surely worth the experience. food is just out of this world. chef andre himself came out and greeted everyone and spent few minutes at every single table. surely deserves to be one of the top 50 restaurants in the world

my first fine dining experience in sg. had tried other michelin starred restaurants in europe & uk. this fine establishment definitely deserves some stars. every dish had a theme and they were all special and unique. presentation was excellent. dishes were very creative. we lost count on the number of dishes we had from the start till the end. i doubt u'll feel any hungry after this 3.5hrs experience. a wonderful experience and i'll recommend to anyone looking for a good french fusion fare.

I had lunch at Andre , and as I had a really bad experience at another restaurant . . . I wrote to them asking if they could make my lunch vegetarian . . and yes they could. So f your are vegetarian .. and like fine dinning this is the place to go in Singapore.The food was good and worth the price . . . I ordered the non alcoholic Kombucha and it had fantastic taste, but at the same price as the food . . . for small , small glasses, so very expensive drops. I enjoyed lunch here a lot, and can highly recommend this place

It's a must try when you visit Singapore! Each dish was very creative and delicious! We were also fortunate to meet Andre's wife. She is very professional and knows every dish Andre creates. We had lunch there and unfortunately we had limited time for lunch as we had to catch a flight. The Chef was flexible enough to prepare our meal based on our limited time. The ambiance was also very cozy and modern; we saw a lot of cook books on the wall. We wished we could go back soon

Is it too high an expectation to expect 100% perfection for a restaurant that is rated in the Top100 in the world? If you are paying close to $1000 for two people (this included drinks), I think it's fair. Seating arrangement was a bit too close to the next table. We can hear the other couple's conversation so we had to keep our voices low so we can keep our conversation private. Service was lacking a bit on the professionalism side. We thought the service staff were a bit over confident and at times this made us feel a tad uncomfortable. Our napkins were still on the table when the food arrived, so the waiter put the food down next to the napkin and walked away. Ok, so we had to lay the napkins on our own laps. The explanation of each dish was a bit rushed at times and lacking the human touch.Champagne was yum but the two reds that were supposed to pair nicely with the meals was awful. Food came out almost too quickly. The menu is really interesting. The first few dishes were a bit underwhelming, but the degustation reached its crescendo with the foie grass jelly with truffle oil dish which was sensational. The highlight were the risotto (but made with rissoni), the squid pasta, corn three ways and the petit four. Combinations of flavours were amazing eg coriander with peach? Who would have thought! The Chef allows some flavours to speak for itself which we love

Its taken a me while to write this review as we dined here on Christmas Day 2014 whilst on a tour of South East Asia. Not only was this the best dining experience of the trip it was the best meal we've ever had. It wasn't just about the food, the whole experience came to make it a very special occasion.Having eaten a lot of high end restaurants I have a few places to benchmark this against and I know this type of molecular gastronomy is not to everybody's taste but the way it is done by Chef Andre is worth the visit. The restaurant is situated in what looks like a large Victorian house and the feeling caries on inside as it does feel like you are dining in someones house We sat down for dinner at 7pm and did not leave the restaurant until after midnight. Our waiter - Stepan was great in guiding us through the choices and helping out with our dietary requirements. The overall service was one of the standout attributes to the experience. Food wise we had Octaphilosophy menu which consisted of 18 courses plus some extras which the chef threw in of some amazing creations. My personal favourites were the Garden which was some amazing mushrooms with fried potatoes and fish in this edible garlic which looked like it was all some edible flower bed. It sounds like something from Alice in Wonderland but seriously good. I also loved the DIY cake which all the ingredients have to mixed together so you get what looks like flour, sugar, egg and mix it all together to create a cake 'mix' Actually there was not a single bad dish or course, there were some that we didn't like as much as others but even those were brilliant.Afterwards we got to meet the staff and Chef Andre who gave us a short tour of the kitchen which was the perfect ending to the meal, the team were sitting down at past midnight to prepare for the next day. As you can probably guess I loved the whole experience and would do it again in a heartbeat even considering the price we paid

Actually this credit card -reservation practice is done at Ramsey's Petrus (London) , Dinner by Heston & Robuchon (St germain)
Made my online reservation @ Andre without any problem in June 15.

Its such stupid way of reservation, I went to many top restaurants and this one I just wont go, they dont care about patrons then we can also have many other choices.

Best french restaurant in Singapore.
Now there are many good restaurants in Singapore.
But I like this restaurant.
They serve many interesting dishes.

Went to celebrate friend's birthday. We've been to different 'recommended' restaurant and this is really truly highly recommended one. There is not any ingredients listed on the menu and the idea is to give everyone a surprise. Before the start of main course, there are already 7 snacks. Don't be scared by the number, each item is a mouthful but yet can satisfied your palate. Follow by 8 main course. Each one represent a concept. This actually even better than giving me a menu with full of fancy words written. After main course, 2 pre dessert follow by 8 desserts. The creativity from chef who think of the first dessert really worth give him applause. All items put on plate looks like ingredients needed to bake a cake. So you are baking a cake in your stomach (that's the joke from the waiter). Although you keep saying full but in the end, we finished all items without fail
5
Stopped here as part of our world trip and it is certainly up there with the likes of Narisawa in Tokyo and Fat Duck in Bray! Andre is a talented chef and a unique perspective when creating a menu. Relaxed atmosphere, knowledgable staff and great food. Andre offers a personal touch of speaking with his guests after their meal
2
When we ate here, the menu was at the chef's discretion. We were asked for dislikes/allergies, and I said the I disliked chocolate intensely. More of that later.Although the wine list was very good, choosing a suitable wine was impossible, as we didn't know what we were to eat. Accordingly, we took the matched wine option.The savoury dishes were really interesting, with great ingredients and very imaginative preparation; and beautiful plating. The matched wines were not up to the standard of the food; and one of them, a "vin jaune" or "natural" wine, was disgusting. It had the colour, fizz and taste of cider that had been left open too long.Before the desserts arrived, our matching "wine" was brought - a glass of room temperature stout for each of us. Not a good sign.Sure enough, the dessert for each of us including me was a chocolate dish. When I reminded the waiter of what I had said earlier, mine was taken away and replaced with a really lovely berry and shaved ice confection. My stout was NOT replaced with a wine matched to the dessert I was given.Finally, I found when I checked the bill back at our hotel (the lighting at the restaurant was too gloomy to allow this), I found I had been charged for an additional dessert.Never again

We are in Singapore for a three day visit and the highlight of the trip is our dinner at restaurant Andre. We were warmly welcomed into the restaurant and after waiting for just a few minutes, were shown to our table. The chef's table was perfect for us. We met Johann and Pam and they both made us feel right at home. We were given a tour of the restaurant including the kitchen where we saw the staff in action. The appetizers started coming and we were impressed by their presentation and taste. Each dish was explained to us and we appreciated the fact that some dishes tasted distinctly asian and some where clearly western. There are 8 main dishes but lots of appetizers and desserts! We have dined at other Michelin star restaurants worldwide and I have to say that Andre is certainly comparable! What a gem of a restaurant in Singapore!
5
The first time I had the pleasure to taste chef André Chiang's food, was a few years back at the Stamford Hotel in Singapore, I was extremely excited to visit Restaurant André on my return to Singapore and I can truly say I am still in love with his food. Innovative, delicate and refined, presented in a very playful manner. The kitchen brigade and service staff are incredible, the wine pairing was fantastic, featuring some very unusual wines and Maitre 'D Stephan made us feel very welcome. A fabulous experience to start our journey through South East Asia... I will most certainly return
3
Inovative cuisine and creative menu at André's but I must state disappointment:1.) the very specific and limited wine list with prices that are definitly too high for the wines that are proposed. Its book presentation is nice but the 8 page content is a brainstormer ....2.) Aeration vents on the ceiling that are not clean and show some blackish substance... Not to the level wanted by the establishment.3.) overdoing the explanations of the plates4.) little choice of digestives (that was proposed)For the food its a designed defilé of plates decided by the Chef it can be hit or Miss....My photos will show that the plates are all special but are they worth such a reputation or that price, I am not sure... Taste is in the palate of the customer as well.Certainly the Chef is experienced and talented but i guess one can say my expectations might have been too high.I am not sure I will go again..
3
Having eaten at some of the worlds best restaurants I am afraid this one is not in the same league. All the dishes on the tasting menu were certainly presented well but nearly all lacked the wow factor taste experience that you would expect from a restaurant of this calibre. Most staff were friendly - especially the German waiter(Johannes?) but the other male maitre d' was patronising to the point of near rudeness. The Japanese sommelier did not impress, and having chosen a flight of wines to accompany my meal he brought each wine for the next course before I had finished the previous course! Chef Andre and his wife are really nice people who are obviously passionate and proud of what they do- I left without that lovely warm feeling of satisfaction I have from other establishments
4
Fantastic set 'gastronomy' menu of 10 courses, with matched wine. The bill for two of us came to us$1100... a memorable experience and worth it, but don't think I will be doing it again for a while.

Really good place to visit for a fine ding experience service is fast food is fabulous . Will advise you to only maintain your satndards.

This is the very stereotypical restaurant for one-off dining – birthdays, anniversaries and other celebrations because one feels like spending S$1000 for 2 people to have dinner.The idiocy of this is further compounded by how infuriatingly over-rated and easily forgotten (until you get your credit card bill) this restaurant is.The good bits first, there are a couple – the chef is clearly talented, if maybe in a sous-chef kind of way – there are some good ideas in a few dishes and this shines at times throughout the meal. However things dry up pretty quickly – dishes seem painfully executed, ingredient pairing fizzles out quickly and overall, you are left with what seems to be a futile exercise in style – worthy of a cookbook not of a dining experience. Very little coherence and the philosophy applied to the meal simply doesn’t hold when compared to the actual execution.Second good bit is that the host, Pam, Andre’s wife is lovely and fun – she’s certainly a respite to the hit-and-miss service – a little painful was to hear about the various pottery pieces created by Andre “he did this one and look over there than one too…” – we got it, he’s crazy creative…That aside, everything else ranged from underwhelming to downright appalling.Things start wrong early on – the booking process is the most moronic I have experienced – to book a table one needs to pay S$50 ahead of times to secure it (for which you either can pay online with a VS or MC card or have to print a form, enter all CC details, scan and email it back if using an Amex!) and abide by a cancellation policy which makes leaving a Russian gulag look easy.Having braved this and obtained a table (at short notice, clearly plenty of space), we arrived on time to the weirdest welcome ever – a very frazzled host with limited English in what looked like a heated conversation on her mobile – running around inside the small foyer and gesturing whilst repeating “this is a crazy call”… She eventually hung up and walked us through the lift to reach the 3rd floor (very nice touch – the lift gives directly onto the kitchen – oddly however everybody stopped what they were doing to look at us).Décor is decent and fairly typical of modern high-end restaurants – nothing amazing and I was facing the wall – very small space with small alcohol lamps burning by the ledge – their smell became quite potent towards the end of the meal.The concept of a fixed menu is really bad – makes obvious sense from a business perspective (which Restaurant Andre clearly is) but the lack of choice and the amount of food is simply too much – even Pam admitted that she couldn’t eat more after Memory… small dishes after small dishes come out to the point where whimsical touches becomes just another blur of over-engineered food.This is show-off cuisine for the Michelin guide or the San Pe list, not a concerted effort to deliver a great experience to dinners.A few “highlights”:- Very mixed service overall – one guy was very good and quite clever in the way he handled things, a couple of the female wait-staff were terrible.- The wine list is ridiculous – basically stuffed with “Vin de France” which is a nice branding for “vin de table” = really cheap wine in France… here you get to pay S$250 for the privilege of drinking a 6 euros bottle. Most idiotic of all – two whole pages on Didier Dagueneau, the master of Loire-valley wines – except they don’t sell any of his wines… only one is mentioned – Asteroid (06 and 08) described as “priceless” (ugh!)… when I enquired with Pam she categorically told me these were not for sale yet when I spoke to the sommelier, he told me I could buy one making all sorts of suggestive looks with his small beady eyes. I passed since this was clearly going nowhere.- On this, the sommelier is the worst I have ever seen, no contest – not just clueless but totally incompetent – poured wine outside of the glass, poured wine in the wrong glass, therefore mixing two wines, offered a free glass of a wine he described as fantastically complex and which was barely drinkable. Absolutely shocking to see this.Overall, this is a really pointless exercise in over-engineered, over-styled and under-whelming cuisine – if you have ever eaten in a restaurant of the highest standard you can immediately spot the gaps. To be avoided unless you fancy over-paying to over-eat

I loved the privacy that this restaurant provides - it's a real intimate experience and from the outside of the restaurant you'd think it was someones house! I dined at a table near to the kitchen and at the end of our amazing degustation we were taken through into the kitchen to meet the staff and taken on a tour of the whole restaurant. The wall of awards and accolades to the chef/owner Andre Chiang is a testament in itself of the wonderous food journey you're taken on. I need not explain how great the food was, and to be honest, it's so much more fun leaving this as a surprise for yourself! You really must visit especially if you're a huge lover of food and can appreciate it as an art
5
A great combination of Alain Jacques as Maitre d' and André Chang behind the stoves. Quite simply an incredible meal. Service was one of the best ever had, so personal, so human, so detail-oriented. And the food was quite simply awesome. Great imagination, fantastic presentations, über-delicious. Thanks for a remarkable experience.
5
Andre is the best restaurant in Singers in my opinion. Others like Jaan don´t even come close. A set 6 course meal costs 128 $, which is fair in my opinion. Wines by glass start at 30 $, expensive as everywhere in Singapore...Highlight is the signature dessert Snickers 2015!Service is exceptional, they even invite you into the kitchen
5
Although the dishes change daily I won't spoil the surprise or bore you with the details of each of the amazing dishes that we had for lunch at Andre.I will tell you that the dining room is small but very tastefully decorated. Equally as good as the food was the service. Stepan and Vanessa were very professional but also great personalities. It was a treat to meet Chef Andre after the meal and then to visit the kitchen.Go for lunch or go for dinner. You won't regret it
5
Lunch at Restaurant Andre was the highlight of our trip to Singapore. Loved the quirky and modern decor, including our own personal sheep on which to place handbags. The food was imaginative, superbly executed and delicious and we appreciated the opportunity to meet chef Andre. Equally impressive was the fabulous service provided by all of the staff, but particularly Vanessa, our sommelier and Stepan, the restaurant manager who went out of his way to advise on other great places to eat in Singapore. The whole experience was warm and friendly, not the austere environment so often associated with food of this quality. This restaurant is a reflection of the quote ..."The whole is greater than the sum of its parts" Next time we will be back for dinner
5
I have traveled to many places and have been to a lot of Michelin star rated restaurants all over the world and this was definitely the best experience ever. My wife took me here for my 40th birthday dinner and it was fantastic. The food, the pairing wines and the service (came with a very personal touch from chef's Andre's wife and a greeting from Andre himself) and a very special attention for my birthday made this an unforgettable experience. We will be back to celebrate more! A true gem in Singapore. A ps to our sommelier that evening: being a wine lover I would have loved some more pro active explanations about the wines pairing the menu
5
Went to Singapore just to experience Restaurant Andre on February, outcome AMAZING !!! The restaurant outlook itself it's really tempting. The whole experience is really worth every penny . The service team really at the highest par - friendly , professional that make you feel relax comfortable just like what the chef say feel like home . The restaurant decor is very detail and like an art gallery. The highlight of my dinner, the menu with a special approach base on chef philosophy. Can't remember all but I have the menu took home. : ). Besides the food , the pairing is a compulsory. Rather than solely base in artisan label wine, the team features other beverages that elevated the whole experience. The very personal touch when serving dessert, Chef Andre visited all the table and spend some times at the table. This is what made the restaurant unique and soulful. Thanks ....
5
Thank goodness we booked!
The service was prompt and courteous. The food was really impressive. Each service surpassed expectations. I can imagine returning here if I had more time. Thoroughly recommend!
5
This has been the highlight of my visit to Singapore. I believe this restaurant deserves to be the No 1 in World's 50 Best. The tasting menu with Octa philosophy from Chef Andre is an amazing experience. I will remember this meal for long time to come. I am a 2 or 3 course meal person but I scoffed through 20 odd dishes pretty easily here. I can't praise this place enough. The staff were well trained and well informed. It was a perfect theatre and harmoniously conducted by the lady of the house.I can't recommend this place enough - book quite in advance as waiting list is huge
5
I've eaten at several superb restaurants worldwide. I would have to say this is up there with the best. Fantastic service and attention to detail. Wine match is recommended. Food was exquisite with several extra courses. Menu changes regularly although the foie gras and truffle dish always appears. Just as well. They cater for dietary requirements. Only limiting factor is the price but you will not walk away disappointed

my wife took me here for my birthday. What a disappointment. First the decor: looks good at first but details are not there. We were at the third floor. Lamps on the ceiling are cheap spots from IKEA. Forks and knives are mostly standard and old. Glasses feel like plastic... Service was just ok. Million Kms away from what you have in a standard 2 or 3 stars restaurant but ok. Just that my wife asked them to bring a cake with a candle and they forgot !Wine: champagne was good, but the wine... Wow, this cannot be a sommelier. He served us without even asking us to taste first. Just served full glass like this. Then the wine was awful. I mean, this was the type of wine you have in a "pichet" back in France: Cheap wine that you take with a sandwich or a quick dish. We asked to change it and the second one wasn't much better. It is a shame in such a restaurant. Food: some dishes were great but maybe 2 or 3 out of the 10 we had. Totally disappointing. The lamb was not good (the one I cook at home is better) the potato from Noirmoutier were so-so. Bad luck for the cook I know this place very well and the ones I cook there are better too ! Overall, you can enjoy your food but it doesn't worth the money. The cook made his classes in France but it is very far from what you would expect from a "Michelin-star" restaurant. No possible comparison. Their deserts were not good: bad macarons, a DIY cake: awful, could not finish it (like 2 or 3 other dishes). At first, it tastes like your cereals in the morning and after you wish this were your cereals cause it would taste better. So maybe we had bad luck with this day menu, but I don't believe it. They serve 10 dishes so you can accept having a couple that you don't like, not majority. I am very surprised this restaurant attracts so many people and is so well appreciated. Anyway, I would not recommend it for anyone that already have a good experience of very nice cuisine from France or even from other nice "fusion" restaurants. Julie

Went there with my partner and got our mind completely messed up(in a good way) food was consistently amazing and service will just put the rest of the restaurant to shame. Wine pairing by sommelier stimulates my palate in the most magnificent way. Overall, worth every single penny!
5
This was an incredible experience through the "Octaphilosophie" at Restaurant Andre. The Restaurant is nr. 37 of the world and nr. 5 in Asia according to the S. Pellegrino list. And I understand why. Each dish is not only tasty and the ingredients are of highest quality, each dish is an artwork of it's own, fitting into the story that accompanies the philosophie of Chef Andre. The dishes build up well on each other. Another speciality of the dishes is the fusion between french (mediterranean) fine cuisine and Asian tastes. It is not easy to unite and the tastes are very special, still not to much, for western people, such as me. The dishes go along with special wine recommendations which are special as well, including Japanese Sake (e.g.). Although if I see the relation between the costs for the food (~300SGD) and the wine (~200SGD), I think the food is more worth it. But this is due to the high taxes on alcohol in Singapore as well. If you don't want to go for the full package I guess the food will do with 1-2 glasses of good wine as well. Or just water, if you don't want to drink alcohol. In my opinion, if you go to this type of places you should take the full package, but price is a point.In total we had about 20 dishes (the first ones pretty small), so you can still enjoy the last dishes as well. Some of the creations are extremely special and explode in your mouth. One of my favourites were some calamari noodles, acuatlly calamary cut as noodles, in a herb and Japanese algae if I rememeber correct (pesto like) soup. No real noodles involved. And served with a wooden spoon, which somehow made it taste even better. Excellent! I liked other dishes as well, but I don't want to go through them all.This place is a recommendation for those who are willing to taste a fully creative menu, designed to be unique. Be prepared for usual and unusual combinations, but all of them tasty.Last but not least the service was great as well. Everybody was very friendly, but still leaving space for privacy. Many international people serving, which you feel at home wherever you come from. There was no waiting time, so the menu was extremely efficient. Maybe 5 more minutes in between the dishes would have been fine, but never mind
5
I was there to celebrate my friends' birthday. Fortunately we manage to get a table. If you are planning to dine there especially for dinner (during weekend), try to book in 2 3 months in advance. No joke! The food portion is right, the taste is excellent, the service is friendly, the decoration of the food is unforgettable - you wont get to see it anywhere except at Restaurant ANDRE...each dish is a surprise to us (combination of the presentation and the taste).What I can say is the chef is cook with passion
5
My husband surprised me with a dinner here on our honeymoon! It was just amazing from the moment we stepped trough the entrance! The sommelier helped us pick a very interesting wine which my husband, also a sommelier, really appreciated! After our dinner the staff recommended and even walked us to a cool bar nearby. The perfect finish to a great dining and service experience! I would be surprised if this wouldn't be a 2 start restaurant within 2 years
5
Went for lunch to make the meal more economical. What a meal! 5+ tasting menu courses that looked exquisite, smelled great and tasted awesome. Impeccable service, well timed courses. Small good looking place right on top of the Outram Park subway station. You might feel that you should keep reverently quiet while dining but ignore that feeling. Staff was all awesome and engaging.Small notes to be aware of: wine is available as a pairing, by the bottle and by the glass. They only have really good wines and they are priced accordingly. The minimum by the glass during our visit was $30 which was out of our price range. The bread and butter are fantastic, be sure to eat it all!Well worth the price and we would go again
5
We went here while in Singapore and were blown away by the whole experience.The tasting menu was exceptional with an Asian twist. Presentation of the food was first class and quite quirky.Service was relaxed, efficient and knowledgable. A must if you are visiting Singapore and want to experience a culinary spectacle
5
Celebrated our anniversary at Restaurant Andre, had to say that we thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. It was a gastronomic experience.
Favourite dish: Pure
5
http://missneverfull.com/singapore-restaurant-andre/ Top-ranked restaurant in Singapore according to Asia's Best 50 Restaurant 2015. The food was undoubutly good - the taste, texture and flavor. Service was 100/100, ambiance was simple and elegant. Lunch(Wed&Friday only) is more affordable priced at $128++. Will revisit soon.
5
A truly fine dining experience, loved the foie gras, John dory and even a simple mash potato was perfectly cooked in a special way. Expensive wine by the glass but worth the money and thank you Andre for you personal service.

Andre is perhaps the most sophisticated dining experience that Singapore has to offer. It is hugely expensive, and the meals they serve deserve the price.Named after its chef, Andre is a Chef's restaurant.I understand that its tables are booked weeks in advance. It is spread over three narrow floors of an old Singapore shop-house, located in the more residential part near China Town. It was in this very building that the great founder and President of Singapore late Lee Kaun Yew had first set up his law practice. I was told that he had come when Andre first opened its doors. Chef Andre, though born in Taiwan, moved to France when he was 15, and learned his cooking in south of France. Andre has created his own version of French food. I always thought French cuisine was overrated, but Andre changed that misimpression in the course of one meal.The ground floor has two long teak-wood Chef's tables, which are usually offered when a party of six or more make a booking. But the first floor two-room dining area is equally coveted, as the Chef makes it a point to visit every table sometime during the meal.The Menu isn't a menu at all. It doesn't describe the food, it describes the experience. It is an eight course meal and each course has a name: Pure, Salt, Artisan, South, Texture, Unique, Memory and Terroir. The Menu then goes to describe the experience. So 'Pure' is described as "Beauty can be found in the simplicity of pure, unadulterated ingredients. Untainted by any form of seasoning or cooking, this dish allows the produce to speak for itself ". And 'Unique' is described as "What makes a dish unique? Sometimes, it is the possibility of experiencing a common ingredient in a different way. At other times savouring an exotic ingredient is the key to making a dish unique".And that is exactly how the rest of the menu is set out. No mention of what a dish contains. But when each dish, with its slightly more than bite sized serving is brought to the table, your waiter takes time to explain in detail what each dish contains, and how it is cooked.The eight entrees follow three starters, and the meal ends with three desserts.Bite-sized that each serving may be, it all adds up to a very heavy meal.By the time it is over, you have tasted everything from the humble radish or potatoes, to snow peas and shallots, to asparagus. Or from a medallion sized rare steak, to squid and oysters, to foei-gras, to caviar, to truffle.The wine list is impressive. Andre carries only French vintage. But the good thing is that wine is served by the bottle or by the glass. And the sommelier is most helpful.For me, the most memorable part of the meal was after it was over. The Head Waiter led us down to glimpse into a busy kitchen, with a dozen chefs and cooks working at their stations, Ander included. His beautiful wife, a native Singaporean, dressed in silk and pearls walked us out of the restaurant while the Head Waiter went off in search of a taxi. Chef Andre stepped out too, if only for a moment, and thanked us for coming and enjoying his food. It was as if you had gone to dine at your friend's place and they were seeing you off.Chef Andre is included in the list of the 15 most influential Chefs of the next decade. No wonder New York Times rates Andre as “top 10 restaurant in the world worth a plane ride.

Restaurant André really is a little gem. And in Singapore, which has so many excellent restaurants, that means a lot. The kitchen is mostly French, with a touch of Asian cuisine. Each course is carefully constructed and very well balanced. The food is great, no doubt about that, but what makes this restaurant really stand out is the wine selection: Restaurant André imports its own wine. The wine journal is a real book with some extra pages added. Those pages contain a lot (too much to read it all) of information for wine lovers and enthusiasts.Since I'm from Belgium, I was pleasantly surprised to hear the sommelier of Restaurant André, Vanessa Masse, worked for years in restaurant 'In de Wulf', one of the best restaurants in Belgium, in my opinion. Needless to say, my expectations were very high. I was not disappointed at all. We started our meal with a lovely spumante. We were presented with a lovely appetizer to cleanse our palate. I was really impressed by this variation on a mojito, served as a little bite.Each following course was a little work of art. So very beautiful and tasteful! My favorite courses were the Winter Root Vegetables with Cured Spanish Mackerel and Wild Herbs and the Pearl Couscous With Razor Clam, Emulsion Of Chorizo, Puree Of Clam With Basil.Serving staff was very professional, but not to stiff (as can be the case in this sort of restaurants). The staff was really friendly and with a sense of humor. I like that!The atmosphere in the restaurant is refined and elegant. Really loved the fake sheep which had as only purpose to serve as a handbag holder. I had some troubles opening the really heavy door of the toilet. Luckily there was always a staff member present to open the door for me.Whith each course we got another lovely wine. It was clear (!) that Vanessa Masse had a thing for unfiltered wines. And I couldn't be more pleased with her selection. All the wines were excellent. Really nice to taste all these different flavors.When asked for a suggestion to end the meal in style, Vanessa proposed an umeshu (Japanese plum liquor). Without a doubt the best umeshu I have ever tasted in my life. So, we just hád to order another one.I would definitely recommend this restaurant when visiting Singapore, but be warned, a dinner at restaurant André comes with a hefty price tag. Lunch is a more affordable option

I have visited many gastronomic restaurants world wide and this is very highly rated. It has great setting in a delightful shop house close to China Town in Singapore and the food was very nice and undoubtedly good but just a little overdone, for my liking.Service was excellent. We chose the wine paring which is the best way to do degustation but made it very expensive. Enjoyed the experience but not my best
5
Finally made it here when an opportunity to bring a friend came up. Made a reservation about 3 weeks in advance to get a table. Nice welcome at the doorNice decor with 2 levels, kitchen on the ground floor. Upon sitting down, it was announced there will be 16-20 courses, so be preparedThe 1st couple of dishes are "snacks". Pretty and delicious dishes and we were told to use our hands. Then came the 8 or Octo-philosophies of dishes. Kinda cool for chef Andre to have this format and theme. They were all very good of course. Lastly, out came 4 desserts in succession and petit fours. A sweet ending and found the DIY cake particularly interesting At $298, I would say it's pretty good value. Almost 90% of the ingredients are imported, holy cow. What is overpriced are the usual suspects, drinks. $45 for glass of champagne and $30 for water. Hmm. Service is generally good too, with some humor. Andre came out near the end of service and spoke to everyone, which is always a nice touchQuite amused with some critics here. There will always be haters I gues

André is definitely a place to go for a special food experience. The restaurant is located in a cute little house South chinatown. Decoration is simple but nice. We had the lunch menu for a birthday and I was very impressed by the originality of the dishes we got. This is exactly what I expect from a 3 stars like Michelin restaurant: try some tasted and some combinations of ingredients that turn a meal into a culinary experience. And this was quite and experience.

Had an amazing afternoon at Andre ' s, truly first class.The food was superb and the wine pairing outstanding. Service is the highest standard I have ever experienced with a true team effort, not just one star.Deserves the many a cold es it has already received.

This is no ordinary restaurant, it is an experience, a travel of the taste and the senses....and boy what a trip ! Everything thing was absolutely delicious, beautifully presented, perfectly cooked and seasoned. The staff is so nice and so helpful, explaining everything in a very friendly atmosphere. The chef came to greet us, took time to joke, to take pictures, to talk about his food. Obviously you have to be a foodie to embrace it because it is not your everyday restaurant, though The place totally deserves at least 2 Michelin stars and it is definitely in my top 5 of the best restaurants I have been to.

Andre is a fantastic restaurant hidden away in a gorgeous building. The food was beyond impressive, service was wonderful and the setting/furnishings impeccable. Would highly recommend this restaurant to any foodies traveling to Singapore.

We visited this restaurant on our honeymoon and would highly recommend it! Amazing food, great service in a beautifully and tastefully decorated restaurant. This was definitely one of our honeymoon highlights.

Having eaten in so many high end restaurants this is still my favorite. One has to be prepared for a minimum three hour dinner (which I do find tiring), because of the numerous courses and now they have introduced new tasters or they call them snacks (in between the courses). Each course is exquisite in its presentation e.g a beach like presentation including rocks to serve the oyster. The highlight must surely be for desert they put ingredients like butter and sugar and flour for us to make a cake - except that it is not egg, sugar or butter but like a mixed ice-cream concoction. Unfortunately some of the courses were A+ in presentation but not A+ in taste (maybe only an A). Service was also excellent. As we left, our server walked us down, to showcase the kitchen on our way out. And he stayed with us until we got our car from the valet to wave us off. This is full service.
5
Foodies whom travel the world in search of innovative and spectacular food must not leave Andre off their culinary bucket list. His unique approach to presenting well balanced savoury flavours in each course is outstanding. Unlike other reviewers I am not going to give away any of the theatre of dining at Andre. Exceptionally served by delightful staff, Andre made an appearance as well to wish my husband Happy Birthday. The only negative is the dining room is noisy, expect to hear other table conversations, as well as the constant waiting staff footsteps. Must not miss if you enjoy fine food. Andre is a chef to watch as one of the greats for the 21st century

What can I say. You do not book a table at Andre in order to have dinner. You book a table here in order to get a unique and special experience! ...and thats what you get. I will not even attempt to describe every course. There was 21 servings! All fantastic in their own way. Starting with snacks! Lovely seafood snacks, crispy and savory chips, eatible soil, eatible charcoal. A playful and fun start building up the curiosity to Chef Andres octaphilosophy dinner. Eight Courses each with a unique theme. I would like to Point out the Memory theme, the salt theme and the unique theme as extra memorable. The Memory dish was the first dish that Andre constructed that actually ended up on a menu during his training in France. Fois Gras and black truffles! Can it go wrong? No it cannot! We choose to have the wine pairings (including some beer and some sake) with each coarse. I Think that is always a wise choice when visiting top class restaurants...after all they do employ sommeliers for a reason. The deserts was also very playful. We will not forget the dessert that looked like ordinary baking ingedients. You got your butter, your flower, your suger and your eggs and milk and got to mix it all together into a Lovely gooey mix! Delicious!As expected the service was spotless. Actually a Little bit more relaxed and laidback than on other restaurants in this category, which we REALLY liked. Fine dining restaurants can sometimes border on stiff. Andre does not do that at all which is refreshing. At the end of the evening, before leaving, we got to peak into the kitchen and shake hands with Andre himself. Very appreciated

Reservation responded promptly which is to my liking. 50 Singapore dollars was charged to validate the reservation which is fine by me. Upon arrival, my daughter and I were greeted and seated properly. The menu was introduced to us and I asked for 2 glasses of wine to pair with the food. The first dish, Japanese oyster is fine, without any surprise. The second dish is stone crab tartar with cucumber disc and sea urchin, which is quite a delight in texture and flavor. The third was squid spaghetti with charred grains and seaweed coulis in potato mousse. This one is a let-down. It's just a bit too heavy on the saltiness (and seasoned unevenly) and when I pointed out to the waiter, they didn't even bother to bring it to the kitchen and just gave me an answer like "that's the natural taste of the dish". And so I need to gulp down a glass of white wine to clear my taste buds .... Very disappointing ... The smoked eel cannelloni is done quite well. The sheep curd and caviar went beautifully with it. Main course is slow roasted pork which is really the major disappointment of the meal. The meat was tender, but the skin was quite chewy and hard to be separated by knife. Sun dried papaya turned out to be the star of the dish. The meal ended with green pea ice cream with espuma of macha and milk. No surprises or wow factors throughout the meal. Overall I'd have to say it is way below my expectation

We first visited Andre over a year ago and it was spectacular, unfortunately upon a second visit it was very disappointing. After a year of service the menu has barely changed - pretty much the same menu - dehydrated chips on a tree were the same, squid ink coloured bread, a sea scene with oysters, the garlic and chocolate soil, the memory dish (although Andre likes to keep this and it is a stunning dish)....I could go on and there were certainly no surprises.... There were also some very weird dishes with no place in this kitchen - a very strange starter with vanilla oil (Mais, horseradish and vanilla oil), which tasted more like a dessert gone wrong and the desserts were very disappointing - a tasteless make your own cake which, whilst fun, lacked any texture or crunch and was very bland. The whole dining experience was very rushed - initially we were told this may take up to 5-6 hours and when our neighbouring table started complaining that instead of 6 hours they only took 2 we knew we were not the only table being rushed. Our "snacks" came out so fast they were piling up in front of us! Last time we came Andre's wife was calm, very friendly and took us for a tour. This was a very special unique experience. At this sitting Sudarampai “Pam” Chiang (Andres wife) was very flustered and obviously stressed and didn't even come to greet us and although a tour was mentioned at the beginning of the night one was never offered at the end. By far the biggest disappointment was the sommelier - a new sommelier since September. Andre used to have a unique quirky wine list - this is no more! - champagne (yes it was appellation champagne (see below for why this detail is worth pointing out), but didn't grab us with any finesse, finish or complexity), a very acidic white wine near Loire (way too tart and did not go with the food at all and is from nearby Loire (i.e. Vin de France) because the sommelier kept reminding us that "she doesn't do appellations" (as if this is some badge of honor and the only good value wine out there is Vin De France and the rest of the world has it wrong!!)), a Beaujolais (again, from nearby, heaven forbid it was actual appellation), a BEER (yes you heard it) which, whilst it could have been quirky if the flavour profiles matched, had no place in this fine dining experience and lastly tomato, eggplant and basil juice (unique but seriously; as one of the wine courses in a $220 wine tasting accompaniment??). Hence we left feeling extremely poor value for money to pay $220++ per head for three glasses of common wine, a beer and a juice! The sommelier was also not very pleasant almost being proud to say "I don't serve Bordeaux" "I don't serve appellations" and the final nail in the coffin for us talking about how she does not like living in Singapore. We found this very offensive as we love Singapore and such negativity anyway was not what we wanted to hear! In the end we paid 450++ (per head for food) 220++ (per head for drinks) and at 670++ (this did not include water and coffees) making it the most expensive, rushed and disappointing meal we have ever had in Singapore.In a nutshell - definitely not for repeat visits and indeed even first time I'd say, save your money and go elsewhere! Until the menu and Sommelier changes this place is not worth the expense

We had a reservation for this restaurant for lunch only to arrive and find out they cancelled our reservation. They did nothing to help us even though this was for our anniversary celebration and we told them we were only in Singapore for 3 days. We have been to many top restaurants and this type of service is unacceptable.

Andre ticks all the requirements of fine dining - presentations, tastes, textures, atmosphere, service. We are especially grateful to Stepan for his outstanding service! The time passed with Stepan around was fun and relaxing, he was top notch professional, we almost felt that we gained a friend. Food wise - the start of the menu was nice - new tastes and flavours. However, by the second half of the menu taste became more flat, not original, especially Terroir. And the desert was the biggest disappointment for us. It was very abundant - 5+ deserts. But!... almost all of them of a very "usual" taste and texture (Andre, apologies if we missed or did not appreciate something among deserts, but disappointment is exactly the feeling we experienced). The dinner missed that last, closing punch to make the full experience memorable. Indeed, we left full, but we did not leave with desire to be back or feeling of being surprised or amazed. We would love to see a revamp of desert menu. It should not be a lot, one or two WOW dishes will be enough, and Andre is fully capable of it

From the moment the door is opened for you ones steppes into the world of beauty, taste and comfort. The dinning experience at Andre is that of visiting a good friend who has the talent and passion for food, flavour and presentation combined with fun, joy and playfulness. The 8 course menu plus 16 more little side dishes is well worth the price. The menu doesn't give much away however the staff are very tentative and explain every course as it comes out. The wine selection is limited to French wines ranging frim $ 100 up. The degudtion is $ 300. The only thing I could critesice is .... no , sorry, nothing. I don't really have any comment. The dinner is perfect for those who appreciate good inspired food with textures with bold flavours.In particular enjoyed meeting Andre.I wish the restaurant, Andre and staff the very best anf hope the will keep moving up in the world ranking (currently at 37)Highly recommend this restaurant to fellow food lovers

Food and wine.. best indulgence ever. This place is perfect for a romantic night filled with privacy.

My husband took me to Restaurant Andre for my birthday dinner. We eat at top restaurants around the world regularly, and have been waiting for an excuse to visit.Certainly the quality of the food was on par with the best restaurants in the world. The attention to detail and the subtlety of the flavour combinations and tastes were just superb. One aspect that stood out was that the waiter was in constant contact with the chef, which meant we never waited more than 5 - 7 minutes between courses, of which there were 12.While the food was sublime, the non-alcoholic drink pairing left a great deal to be desired, most unfortunately. However, the service was fantastic and the staff lovely.Like all top restaurants in Singapore, it was expensive compared to top restaurants in many other countries, but if you are looking for a first class dining experience, Restaurant Andre is a great choice
5
I have a habit of doing research online for good restaurants in countries that i visit and make it a point to try the food. In my quest of good food, i have sometimes been disappointed. On this occasion Restaurant Andre surpassed my high expectations. My husband knows I've always wanted to go to Andre as I love good food so he surprised me for my birthday. He booked a table for 3 (Our son loves good food too). He had told them it was my birthday. When we arrived, we were immediately seated. Service staff knows their work very well, and very polite. They took our drinks orders and explained what we were to expect along the way. There was a menu but it did not describe what food we were having just, some nouns or adjectives eg. "texture", "pure", "salt", "South of France". The food was divine, so creative, beautiful arty pieces and the taste was superb, Well deserving of their Michelin stars. My husband had the wine pairing as I'm allergic to alcohol and our son is not really into alcohol. The wines are from small wineries but the wines (according to my husband) is most tantalizingly delightful and goes very well with the meal.Just prior to dessert, they brought out a little chocolate coated cake (It's a banana cake with hits of passionfruit/citrus) with a little candle and they brought out a wooden (with a couple sitting over a candlelit dinner) spinning musical box which had the happy birthday tune. After i cut it they took it away and brought it back in three separate plates after dessert. Such a nice touch. They also presented me with a card wishing me Happy Birthday in French and it was signed by the entire Andre team. Service was impeccable to the end. They had asked if we were going home by taxi and offered to get us one too without being prompted. The service staff even led us out all the way to the front door and wished us goodbye and Happy Anniversary (This was probably because the card had Bon Anniversaire on it)I always like to treat my husband to fantastic meals on special occasions. After Restaurant Andre, i think I'm going to have a hard time finding a restaurant that is better

We were having a short trip to Singapore and had placed a reservation request over a month before. It is sooooo lucky that we've made it as some of our friends had told us that it is rather difficult to make an reservation successfully, we've guaranteed the table a deposit made in advance.Other than the delicious food with concise design, the most impressive thing are the pre-dessert, dessert and the tea. Beside, the plates are all tailor made that they are all unique and of varied shapes!! That's artistic enough~The dessert is called "purple", which is my favourite colour! Consist of black currents, sweet potato and lavender. The colour is romantic. I told the waitress that I love purple the most. To my surprise, she then suggested me to try out a "purple tea" - the blue butterfly tea. The tea is originally blue in colour, but after adding lemon into it, it TURNED PURPLE!! Like a magic, I liked it~~Service was very good. The Japanese waiter spoke English very well and explained the components of the dishes in a detailed manner. The environment was cozy too. Chef Andre is also very friendly and nice that he had a decent talk with us, and offered us a menu with his signature!! We were both very glad to take pics with him =DI shall recommend people to try it
5
Restaurant Andre is special not just because of food is great but because of the overall philosophy and concept of each dish. And to enhance this magic experience, an amazing wine pairing (well done Vanessa) and warm special service (obrigado Alan). And when you realised that all of this is probably an act of god, Andre himself just mingle around with a personable and approachable attitude. I will plan to return.
5
This restaurant should be at least on the Top 10 of the world's best! Pictures cannot do justice to what you're going to experience. Every item has a story leading to another, something like a food journey. Service was exquisite! Chef André was really friendly and very humble. Simply amazing

My husband and I had lunch at Restaurant Andre on Friday September 26. Apparently the same day that tofuandpesto was there (because we had the same menu). This is my first restaurant review here - so I have to provide an introduction. My husband and I are in our late 60's - and have been traveling for 4+ decades to explore food and fine dining in various parts of the world. Our primary goal is to have delicious enjoyable meals. And we certainly succeeded at Restaurant AndreOverall - our experience was 3 thumbs up. In terms of Michelin standards - I'd say Restaurant Andre would be a solid 2 star restaurant if Singapore had Michelin ratings. The food wasn't old fashioned - or totally cutting edge (i.e., you don't know what the heck you're eating) either. I think Chef Chiang has his own distinctive sense of style in terms of food - ingredients - preparations - and presentations - and seems to be marching to his own drummer. Overall - I'd classify his food as French (he lived a lot of his life in France and trained there).The restaurant does have one thing I don't care for - although it's becoming the norm these days. Only a single tasting menu. On the other hand - at least at lunch - it is an extremely manageable menu. Two amuse courses - and then 6 small courses. A very good amount of food (not too much - not too little) - served over a reasonable amount of time (somewhat more than 2 hours). The price - 128 SD - is reasonable as well (dinner is a lot more expensive - almost 300 SD).There was only one course that didn't hit the mark in terms of taste. The rest ranged from very good to delicious. One - charcoal grilled black cod (topped with uni - not mentioned on the menu) with soubise and burnt cabbage and jus de cuisson and smoke oil - was fabulous (burnt cabbage sounds totally weird and looked weird too - but the dish tasted much much better than it sounded or looked like).Our server - who is an "old" pro - and has been at the restaurant since it opened - provided excellent service. He was also nice beyond a fault (he walked with us out of the restaurant after our meal for about a block and pointed us in the right direction in terms of our next destination - no mean feat since it was about 90 degrees and he was wearing a suit!).We chatted with Chef Chiang for about 20 minutes after our meal - and found him to be quite charming and unassuming in general. A pleasant surprise considering the trajectory of his still relatively short career. His restaurant is ranked #1 in Singapore on the San Pellegrino list. This was only our first trip to Singapore - but I have no reason to doubt that ranking. As for being the #6 restaurant in Asia and #37 in the whole world - well I have my doubts there. On the other hand - I much prefer the Michelin approach - which rates restaurants individually - over the San Pellegrino approach - which ranks them. There isn't any reason why there can't be dozens or even hundreds of great restaurants all around the world. Restaurants we should dine at when we're "in the neighborhood" (the neighborhood in this case being southeast Asia). And Restaurant Andre is a place that anyone who loves good food should dine at if he/she is "in the neighborhood"

Had a lovely lunch consisting of summer vegetables and black chicken egg, Sakura ebi capellini, egg custard Tasmanian kelp, burnt cabbage and cod, quail, and a lovely noisette ice cream. Service was attentive and friendly. Chef Andre stopped by our table and asked if everything was good. Very friendly and interesting to talk to. They change their lunch menu every time! The food is absolutely delicious in a well decorated environment. Would come here again and again
5
Went there for lunch for a special occasion. Came with such a high expectation and I was not disappointed. One of the best experience I have ever had.Each dish was presented nicely and tasted deliciously. From snacking to main dish and all the way to dessert. The service was top notch too. Not even a tiny misstep
5
It is hard to imagine perfection on a plate, or eight plates, could be any better defined than by a dinner at Andre’s. Andre’s ‘octaphilosophy’ takes you on an unparalleled dining journey through eight exciting and taste-bud-redefining experiences. Add to the eight savoury plates the amuse-bouche, the pre-pre-dessert, pre-dessert, dessert and post-dessert you have a dining experience as close to perfection as anything I have encountered or imagined. Of course you pay for it. My tip: plan a nice dinner out with your loved one every month, but eat cold pizza at home for a few months and put the money you save towards a once in a lifetime experience with Andre! Service, wine matching, incredible artistry and culinary skills – this is an experience that should have a category of its own: ‘restaurant’ hardly seems an apt description for such a wonderful adventure
5
Pure art, the taste, look, texture, presentation serving of the dishes.
Ridiculously good. I'd say the most expensive and the best meal I've ever had. Definitely worth it.
5
We had a great dinner at this restaurant. Lovely food(dessert,main & final). The atmosphere was nice and staffs worked with the most professional way.
5
This place is insanely good. Deconstructing food into 8 philosophies all sounds a bit poncy at first sight, but it is clear even as you walk to the front door that this guy Andre, his wife (front of house) and the entire staff have taken these components which establish the foundation of the menu, together with the perfect surroundings and reconstructed them to create a sensory overload that is worth so much more than any other evening entertainment you could spend your money on. To be clear, it's a pretty punchy investment but it's one of the best experiences I have had in dining or any other form of art/entertainment.The things we loved were over and above just the quality of the cooking (which has to be perfect given the price tag). Firstly the ingredients are selected so carefully and are all unique, small batch produce that change every day given what's on offer. Secondly the wine pairing menu was built on a similar philosophy of small batch individual French producers that you can't find anywhere else in Singapore. We were amazed with what some of the wines were when they were carefully explained by the sommelier. Thirdly was that the staff were so knowledgeable, friendly and professional. It was our 15 yr anniversary and they brought out cakes, a signed card from all the kitchen and then, when I asked if there was any cheese on the menu and the reply was not tonight, they went and got two tshirts of the restaurant with camembert pictures on the front and gave to us. He also advised next time they'll do us cheese if I mention in advance!The best bit for me as a foodie was that the chef came to our table at the end of service and talked to us for a good 15 minutes about his menu, style and asking for feedback. He then showed us the kitchen after dinner and personally walked us down when we had finished. This place is more than just a plate of food and it's important to get that rather than just comparing whether the raw ingredients were as opulent as you think they could be. It thoroughly deserves it's rating as number 6 in the top restaurant list in Asia and I expect to see it higher next year.
5
Andre has been improving is cuisine quality and today can be consider one of the best (if not the best) in Singapore. The location in the small house colonial style adds value to the place but go for enjoying the food and eventualy Andre himself would go around the tables and have a nice talk to you. Andre is a simple caracter than enjoys sharing experience with the foodies
1
Just put this, I had dinner there on Aug 20,2014, there was no water in my glass all the time. Finally I decided to take a photo to see how long will it take just to have water in my glass. One waiter accused me using the flash, I told him I did not, he insisted he saw me taking pictures with it. I did not want to finish my meal after the 4th course. I travel quite a lot and eat in good restaurants quite often, but this bad service is the first time I experienced.

Had a booking last New Years Eve for lunch but when we got there they were closed. We did not get any notification and not even a note on the door to explain why they were closed or any apology to customers who were given a booking that day

My sister and brother in law live in Singapore and have done the rounds of the best restaurants that are on offer. So when they told they were taking us to Restaurant Andre for his degustation menu we we're beyond excited. What a gastronomic delight! My husband is a chef and loved every single dish that came out to the table, slowly devouring ever morsel of food they delivered. Our whole evening was spectacular. From the welcome at the front door to the gorgeous presentation of the food, we couldn't fault our foodie experience. At one point the air con was slightly cold and they offered my sister and I pashmina wraps which is testament to the service we received all night. The wines were delightful and the evening was rounded out perfectly when Chef Andre came an introduced himself to our table and asked if we had an enjoyable evening...to which there was a sea of nodding heads and endless compliments. I would go back in a heartbeat
5
What an absolutely divine gastronomic adventure. Chef Andre uses techniques and flavour combinations that are truly inspiring. The food always arrives at the table looking like a masterpiece and most importantly it tastes divine. I had so many favourite dishes, but I will not spoil the surprise for you!Meeting Andre and his wife at the end of the night was also a highlight. You can just see Andre's face light up when he talks about food and both him and his wife are truly passionate about the business. It is very easy to see why this restaurant has now been named Singapore's best and rightly so it deserves this prestigious title. Now bring on Singapore's first Michelin Star
5
Andre is located in an unassuming house on a quiet street. Unlike most restaurants, you don't select your menu and are served with the menu of the day meticulously prepared by the chef.The degustation menu is a huge selection of intricate foods, visually stunning and a feast for your palette. Most degustation menus have one or two superb items and the rest pale slightly with respect to the signature dishes. At Andre, it is just a home run one after the other. You are so full by the end of the meal, but still cannot wait to see what comes up next.Definitely a meal worth saving up for, especially for special events
5
An amazing experience for all your senses. We've been to some of the best. This is one of the best of the best. Let them whisk you away. There's just the one set degustation menu which apparently changes regularly so explaining the menu to you might be of little use. What you need to know is that they take the food, the wine and the service seriously and they are out to impress you. They achieved their goal with us!Just close your eyes and sign when the bill comes. What the heck, you're not going to do it every day
5
Food and ambiance is fantastic, the service is top grade, Chef Andre is very attentive and we were even given a meet up with him before we left the restaurant overall is the best restaurant in Singapore.
5
My partner and I visited this restaurant for our last night in Singapore and wow, this definitely was worth the wait. The food and service was the best I have ever had, travelling through Andre's prepared dishes of the senses. The staff were extremely knowledgeable about the dishes and wine and more than happy to spend time with you asking questions. Chef Andre deserves all of his accolades, he is very clever in his flavors, execution and left us talking for days afterwards - is that not what food should do! We were lucky enough to not only meet him but get a picture and signed menu. If you are looking for a dining experience that is truly special, please visit restaurant Andre, you will not be disappointed!
5
22 dishes paired with 10 matching wines, thoughtfully put together had a real flow. The experience was a journey. Andre's signature dish - foie gras with truffle was the absolute pinnacle of the evening. I don't do haute cuisine often, but eat at top end restaurants often and this had no equal. Compared to my limited experience of dining at the worlds most famous chefs' restaurants, being Ramsay, Blanc, MPW & JBR - Andre would be my choice over them all. The wine was incredibly delicate and balanced the wide range of flavours and textures very well. In this restaurant the dining experience prevails over any occasion or celebration you might be there mark. It was eye wateringly expensive, in absolute terms, but for a once in a blue moon experience you won't find anywhere close to the fullest dining experience this side of a long haul flight.
5
This is up there in terms of restaurant experiences, one of my top 3 meals. Amazing small producing wines too match. The restaurant from top to bottom is clearly an extension of Pam and Andre--the owners. Very simple decor, yet elegant---amazing food---food from the heart. I would dine here again without question
5
My friend & I decided to dine at No. 37 on the list of The World's 50 Best Restaurants 2014. A first for her and I am a repeat diner. We had an amazing meal & did not regret our time spent there one bit! Chef Andre presented a beautiful & inspired degustation lunch which kept us happy for many days after & gave us many fond memories of our time in his restaurant. His presentation was artistic & flavours were fresh & well-balanced. Chef Andre also demonstrated creativity presenting some foods in ways we never imagined. Since chef Andre first started this restaurant, both his food & service has improved with time. We will definitely be visiting again when we need to be uplifted in our moods. :

I went for lunch on a Friday (they're not open for lunch on weekends), simply because I did not want to pay $298+17% for over-hyped food. BUT, I'm happy to report that it's not just hype, this place is a true-blue gem. The lunch menu was obviously smaller than the dinner menu, but it was still 5 courses plus amuse bouche (they call it snack). The food was perfectly cooked and presented, very innovative, and used only super-fresh and the best ingredients. The service was impeccable and jovial, yet a bit impersonal because the server changes with almost every course. It was a nice touch for them to offer calling a cab, because it started raining outside while I was eating inside.The only disaapointment was that they were not serving the chocolate garlic "soil" that day :( I've read so much about it, and had hoped to taste it. Anyway, I'll be back for dinner one of these days--I hope the "soil" will be back on the menu
5
Dined recently with discerning friends at Restaurant Andre and cannot praise highly enough. The whole experience is exactly that...an experience. No menu is proffered, the chef using daily fresh foods and inspiration. Our server was extremely knowledgeable and experienced, and explained each course with aplomb. Special dietary provisions as also asked for and catered to - a huge bonus as one of our party was gluten intolerant. Excellent wine list and on the whole an awesome night of flavours, surprise, expectation and indulgence. A must try experience. Tip - reservations well in advance
5
There is one primary reason for dining at Restaurant Andre - Andre Chiang. The chef is a genius in flavors and textures. Whether it is a paper-thin sheet or a miniature meringue mushroom, each bite is a burst of flavor. It changes its menu daily (except for the chef's standout dish) under its constant octophilosophy. I have eaten in many first-class restaurants all over Asia, and so far this is the best.Moreover, it has excellent customer service. I had forgotten to taste the soil-like base of one dish (which was actually garlic chocolate), and when I asked for a spoonful after, they gave me a small container to take home! I had forgotten to take a picture of one dish, and when I emailed them days after, they said that Chef Andre Chiang himself took the photo to send to me! Talk about after-sales customer service!I will definitely dine here again, and I highly recommend this for a most unforgettable dining experience

Came here for my 4th Wedding Anniversary. Everyone else on other tables is either celebrating a birthday, anniversary or just there to celebrate. The food was well coordinated and every taste bud in your mouth was fully tested from simple to the most engaging flavours. From the snacks, to the start, and to the pre-desserts, desserts and post-desserts, this meal ensures you leave the place not hungry but fully satisfied. Not forgetting the very attentive service that brings the story of each dish to your table.Oh.. and Andre comes over for a chat to every table to ensure you enjoyed his creations
5
I had a surreal experience at this homey yet sophisticated hotel. From the minute I entered the monochromatic-themed townhouse, I felt special. The attention to detail in every process of the evening was flawlessly executed. My favorite part of the extensive night was the foie gras/black truffle dish (MEMORY). This combination was the best dish I've ever had. The quaint dining room means personal attention to your evening. The staff truly care that you have a spectacular night. I ate here alone as I was traveling by myself, but I never felt alone as the atmosphere is extremely inviting. Each presentation was quirky and had an interactive element to it, which helped bring enjoyment to the meal. Although the food was extremely sophisticated, the atmosphere did not feel pretentious. I highly recommend eating at this restaurant when you visit Singapore. Do reserve in advance

In a word, "EXCELLENT!"Not because it was the best meal I had... Not because I liked every item (in fact, I was disappointment with both the meat and the seafood dishes because I felt that in terms of both flavours and execution, they didn't match the other 'little items' that were much better executed)... Not because we wee so full that we almost had to be wheel-barrowed out...It was an excellent meal because almost everything came together very well... Service was about as good as it gets, with professionalism, friendliness, humour, and a true desire to 'want-to-please' their diners. For a little under three hundred dollars, you really see and taste (apart from those two courses) the effort, skill and passion that went into every little course, and unlike many places that place (in my opinion) too much into 'the show' than 'the go', Andre certainly has 'more go', without foregoing, yet not overdoing, 'the show'...Well done! Will be back for sure

I am not sure any words I could write here could describe this truly amazing restaurant. Every aspect, location, decor, staff and of course the food are up there with some of the best in the world. I would include this restaurant, given we have been lucky enough to eat at Alinea and Moto in Chicago, Fat Duck and Ramsay in Hospital Road, in our world wide top 10 places to eat.

A lovely dining experience with exceptional food and an interesting philosophy to match. Our hosts were charming with wonderful waiters and sommelier. It was a special treat to meet Andre himself. Charming dining room with quirky interior decoration. Perhaps a little more expensive than expected comparing with other excellent dining internationally.

I've heard mixed reviews about this restaurant and have been hesitant to book but we were celebrating a birthday and this restaurant is both top 50 in Asia and the World in the recent San Pellegrino ranking. Service was excellent as to be expected at this price point. We managed to secure a reservation but note that they do tend to be booked about 2 wk ahead. They are closed when the chef is away. He did not come speak with us but we did get a quick peek at the kitchen on our way out. There are officially 8 courses but this doesn't include the amuse bouche and snacks as well as cheese, dessert and petits fours. Their bread is made at sister restaurant Burnt Ends which with the excellent French butter ensured that we left satisfied if not stuffed. I won't review each dish as it changes based on ingredient availability except for Memory (truffle topped foie gras custard). The dishes did not wow me with their flavour profiles. Some dishes were lovely but none (including Memory) etched themselves into my food memory. The baby corn was tasty and beautifully expressed the flavour. Unlike another reviewer I'm not upset to be given a dish of corn. I was however upset that of 8 dishes, one was corn, Texture was bread similar to you tiao (with a squid/spicy dip) and Unique was roasted Jerusalem artichoke topped with mushrooms. While Jerusalem artichoke may be unique to Singapore - as a world class restaurant - to simply roast an artichoke and present this as unique was incredibly disappointing. So 3 of 8 dishes were vegetarian/bread. The only meat offered was duck which was tasty but the size of 2 (small) fingers. There was a French lobster dish but having grown up on fresh lobster, this lobster lacked sweetness and the curry powder added to it did not register - leaving it bland. When charging these prices for a table d'hôte, the chef should ensure that courses are well balanced. Having read other reviews where there are seafood and meat courses offered, I was very disappointed in our 8 dish offering. I asked for more bread to ensure that I did not leave hungry. I really wanted to like this meal but unfortunately can't recommend it at these prices. There are other places to eat at this price point in Singapore.We also did the wine pairing ($188/person) and were not impressed by the selection. Only one of the 6 glasses harmonized with the dish. The pinot noir clashed so badly with the dish that I drank it only AFTER I ate. This is a peeve of mine with many Singaporean restaurants. While the quality of food has risen and the prices have risen astronomically with it, they do not put the same effort into their wine pairings. Wine pairings should enhance the flavour of the dish - it is not just about sourcing an obscure white wine to serve with the seafood plate - when done right, it is worth every penny. So far I have been disappointed by sommeliers in Singapore. On a plus note: they did gift a piece of chocolate cake for the birthday guest and instead of singing they provide a musical box which plays the birthday song. I thought this was a thoughtful and classy touch. BTW: coffee is an extra $6 if you don't want to ask

From the moment we entered the restaurant till we left we were made some welcome and what a dining experience. The service staff were very knowledgeable and really looked after you. From a culinary prospective, this is at the very top and a must if you want to have a culinary journey.We had 16-17 courses but with all of these courses you didnt feel that you had so many and this is a true example of a great chef who can keep the balance. From textures to flavors, it was up there with Per Se, Daniels, Dinner, and Coi. A true culinary experience. What topped it off at the end of the meal was I said that i would walk back to our hotel and the Chef's Wife walked us to the metro station. That is what i call service and going the extra mile. What a lovely gesture..Thank you.

We found Restaurant Andre on the World's 50 Best Restaurants list and decided to try it out while in Singapore... and we were so glad that we did. We have been to a lot of restaurants at this level and this is truly one of the best we have been to. The experience is a journey through different themes and each dish is fantastic. Molecular gastronomy can sometimes get too caught up in the details, but not here - everything tasted amazing. Despite it being a lot of courses, you are still feeling good when you leave (not forcing food down at the end or feeling like you need a wheel barrel). The service was also exceptional. At one point, my spoon slipped into my bowl and within 2 seconds someone brought me a new spoon - which wasn't even necessary, but appreciated. Don't hesitate on this one - you should go
5
If you go to the restaurant you know it is expensive as it is one of the best and we are in Asia/Singapore, so I will not talk about the money. But even if I did, it is all worth it. The experience at the restaurant is like a journey through a food story. Besides the 8 main dishes, there are some small starters as well as more desert courses, so all in all we probably had around 15-20 different small dishes. If you think this sounds a lot, I would say it is just enough as all dishes are small and just give you a little bit of each of the tastes. The service is great and very personal. What I like is that there is no second seating and they adjusted the gap between the courses for us. I dont like being rushed when enjoying such a special meal. You get a tour of the restaurant after you finish your food. The ambience is very nice. If at all I was a little surprised that food was served even if one person had gotten up to go to the bathroom. This just would not happen in Europe. The only real negative in my opinion was that there does not seem to be a (inforced) dresscode. If you spend this much money and you want a special evening, I would prefer not having people in sneakers, hot pants and flip flops walk in and being let in. I do think the restaurant should turn these people away or make them change. It does affect other customers and just does not fit the restaurant.All in all a very special evening and very special dishes you wont find anywhere else. I would definitely go back

To choose a venue for my 50th B'day celebration, we have decided to revisit Andre, Les Amis, Guy Savoy(closed recently) and Iggy's. Our final decision was Andre. On 15th Feb '14, my family of 3, celebrated this occasion with 7 other close friends. We brought 4 bots of wine fr our own collection & the restaurant provided the rest of the champagne and wine arranged by the wine sommelier, Mr Ken Hasegawa, to match the menu of the night. Everything went according to plan, from the flowers for all the female guests of the party to modification of the menu for guests allergic to certain food. On arrival, the guests were whisked to the 3rd flr of the restaurant for champagne and canapés while waiting for the rest of the guests to arrive. After some mingling & photo taking, we proceeded to the 1st flr pte room for dinner. Andre is a no-menu restaurant but we hv requested chef Andre to prepare some of our favourite dishes, like the fish de-construct & foie gras moose. Every course as usual were executed to perfection be it visually or taste. All the guests, even those who have already been there before, were very impressed. Most admitted that it was the best meal they've ever had. I like to thank Chef Andre and his team for making my Birthday a very memorable one. Andre definitely deserve many return visits and the reputation of being the best in Singapore

I was super happy when finally I got confirmation for my reservation this time. I have tried 2 times before on my last visits to Singapore. The restaurant itself is pretty small with decent decorations. The theme of dishes are interesting, Octaphilosophy. A dish representing each philosophy, with the climax of foei grass custard, Chef Andre's signature dish. What I like the most in this fine meal is the deserts part. He served not 1 or 2 desserts, but 4 desserts and petit four. All are so special and excellent

Invited for lunch yesterday...and my feedback follows....Great service with all staff except trainees knowing exactly what we need and what to do...they can recite all ingredients in each course of 5 dishes for set lunch.....Delicious starters but main course of black cod was too salty for my group but oath wise enjoyable...Next main of welch lamb looks nice but not so to taste buds. Meat was bit red and acceptable to eyes but tough when it should be tender being spring baby lamb....not sure if due to cooking or bad supplier?Dessert of generous slice of fresh strawberry tart was delicious and much enjoyed after the scoop of iced lemon sorbet which was lumpy and not fined....perhaps sitting in freezer for while before being served.Coffee in any combination latte, espresso, mocca, macchiato, long black, white, decaf....was nice to finish off a over extended biz lunch.Oh..the wine list which occupied only first 8 pages of an antique book requires a magnifying glass and a new database of unknown small boutique wines....look for appellation and not wine maker....Perhaps good for discovery but not for those that want certainty....grand crus or 1st growth...Busy dining rooms up and downstairs and spanking clean kitchen with many whites...Rather noisy group next table celebrating birthday and getting somewhat slouch....and almost shouting at each other....in Andre?To get your Michelin star...yes for presentation, service but no for taste, wine list and ambience....Of course Chef Andre and guest chef from Paris came by to say hello but we were all too polite to say more than niceties..

Genius! His cooking lets the true flavors of the food come through. Simple, elegant yet mind-blowing. You have to try this at least once in your life.
4
Yes indeed it was such a great experience to have a taste of Chef artistic creation.
The ambiance for us is bit to tight however service was excellent. For me its only good for one time dining experience.
5
Restaurant Andre is dinning, not just Eating. Everything was exceptional. It is a fantastic experience.

I had an important client dinner but my secretary booked the wrong date! And the restaurant is fully taken. Imagine my angst 5 mins before my client arrives with his wife ( who is a food critic). Pam was so gracious to offer a solution of a temporary table for half the course and adjourning to Andre's private chambers for desserts. She saved my night ! The food was creative and exquisitely crafted, each course a differing sensation to the palate, subtle and indulgent. I have brought my family to enjoy Andre a few times since ( booking way ahead and by myself of course). Thanks Pam, Andre, and your whole team

We decided to go for lunch here on a transit in SG on the way back from Italy and France and I have to say it was a waste of time. Food was pretty average and sometimes too rich with flavour, service was average and the ambiance is really what you'd normally expect in a really fancy dining/lunch experience - with not a lot of character. Personally I think, the strong taste might have to do to accomodate 'asian taste’ especially when they’re paying top dollar - I'm asian myself but really find the taste discouraging. I can only hope as the Chef 'progresses' he'll realise big bold taste is not always the way to go. Something about the signature dish just does’t feel right, a mix of Foie Gras and Black Truffle. It just doesn't cut it for me, they both really have distinctive flavours and probably better treated separately. The body of the dish is just like a really-really-soft egg-tart with duck-liver flavour, topped with Black Truffle Jelly - A good mix? probably. An excellent dish? definitely not. I somehow feel the two components are both utterly under-used and over-used at the same time. The 'black' bread and the scallop dish were above average and I really enjoyed both. A couple of tables besides us had an ‘extra’ dish for their entree - the mushroom garden. We promptly asked the waiter and he told us sometimes the chef have extra dishes that they give away. And then later after lunch, we asked the Maitre’d and she told us that they are ‘replacement’ dish as some people do not eat certain food, I knew she was just making excuses, we knew everyone had the same food except for us and also another table just accross us. I just thought Degustation menu means we all get the same dishes. And isn’t that what’s so great about Degustation menu? So the chef can accurately prepare how much to actually put on the table and not have ‘leftovers’ out to certain table?We also had Monkfish which was very leathery and chewy as opposed to a nice succulent 'lobster-like' texture. And the most disappointing dish was the main: Pork Shoulder with Quinoa - extremely average dish, I've eaten a lot of food with quinoa, all were good but that is just about it, there really is not much you can do with quinoa. It was a very pedestrian dish. The dessert was 'airy' yogurt sponge yet another average dish. The chef definitely is showcasing his technique but not a lot of effort on the overall taste and experience. My wife also found holes in one of the leaves on his Pork Shoulder dish – not what you’d expect from one of the top 50 restaurants in the world. And then the last bit; do you really wanna dine in a place where we were offered a top-up of our bottled water at the end of our lunch (they keep the bottle elsewhere and pour it for you) and then the bill shows up with 2 X bottled water (or should I say a-bottle-of-water-and-a-bit)? Cheeky! and this is coming from a couple who had a glass of wine (S$30 each and btw they don't tell you the price nor is it on the wine list) compared to a few other tables besides us who just had water on their table – It’s the kind of behaviour I’d expect when eating at a market. All in all, very dissapointed considering the status

Heard so much about this restaurant whenever I visited Singapore that I had to try it this time. I had an amazing time and a wonderful experience. They offer special creations and they are a must try. Would definitely love to go back again. Staffs were excellent too

For those who are not into food and dining as an art form, don’t go to Restaurant Andre. The complexity of the dishes would be apparent to top chefs and food critics, and to those of us who pursue gastronomy with a passion beyond mere eating. If you are one of those people, expect to be delighted, curious, impressed, and at the end very satisfied. (Don't get me wrong; my wife and I eat at local cafes and holes in the wall across SE Asia from which we also get great pleasure.) Including the three dishes that were served prior to the first course (they called these course zero), there were 12 dishes in all with three of those being desserts. At least 6 of the savoury dishes were of a quality and presentation that we had not experienced at other fine dining and world-ranked restaurants in Australia. The rest of the dishes were merely wonderful. From the attentive though not intrusive service, the taste sensations, the presentation of the dishes, the after-meal visit to our table by Andre, the walk-through of the kitchen area and chef’s table setting (solid wooden table which is sanded back every night!), to the final securing of a taxi, all were done with excellence and a personal touch.The dishes themselves were very different using a touch of molecular gastronomy but not to the point of losing the natural flavours. The seawater foam disappeared in the mouth but tasted just like the sea and was the perfect accompaniment to the seafood. There was no lamb, beef, duck, or chicken served in any dish, yet it was not missed at all. In its place were predominantly seafoods utilising whitebait, sea urchin, caviar, and other fish but used as a component of the overall dish, not necessarily the centrepiece. As stated by other diners, Restaurant Andre is expensive but this is a genuine global player in the finest dining stakes and the experience was worth every cent. Sensational in the truest sense of the word
5
Restaurant Andre is outstanding, from the inventiveness of the dishes, right down to the little details such as the decor and seating. The subtle combination of flavours was highlighted by the freshness of the ingredients. The wine list was amazing, and the pairings by the sommelier was exceptional. Every course was a new and exciting experience, building upon the previous one. Restaurant Andre is almost a must do experience in Singapore, and I expect this restaurant to climb into the top 20 best restaurants in the world
3
For me this restaurant is rather overpriced for this kinda food you are paying for chef artistic sense and his creation however no douth tht the quality of the food and the service is perfect well it is a must visit if you r into the art of the food
5
Restaurant André is amazing. Actually, I do not need to say anything else. This gourmet meal is the most spectacular, extremely exciting and imaginative I ever have eaten. I have visited many restaurants with a Michelin star, but André is perhaps the best. The meal was a journey of over three hours. Each dish was an adventure in taste, composition, and color as well as each dish was a separate work of art in itself. We had a waiter that took care of that the whole thing had a cozy and grandiloquent frame. After the meal came the owner, the chef, and talked with us about the meal and if his gourmet-development. Those who have seen the movie or read the book by Karen Blixen "Babettes Feast" know that it costs to develop a Grand meal, and it costs to visit André. In return we got an experience we never will forget
5
An amazing experience. This Taiwanese chef is fabulous and full of well presented and good mixture of "gout". In France, he would be classified as one of the best.
We cant wait to go back. Thank you chef

I had lunch set SG128++,courses have foie gras,ravioli,pork belly,scallop,caviar.Every dishes were impressive,service was competent,overall was mind-blowing!
4
Five stars is really an inadequate scale when you are trying to give feed back on a restaurant of this caliber. By most standards it's outstanding. Having been fortunate enough to eat at a lot of great restaurants, by that standard it's only average. To start, the room is only average. The wine list is perhaps the most limited I've seen for a restaurant at this level and it always annoys me when there isn't a single offering under USD 100. Service and presentations were very good, but nothing exceptional. I did appreciate the inclusion of a cheese course. There was one, one-bite meat course. Might make my top 100 list, but not top 50
5
It is creative, delicious, friendly, comfortable and unpretentious. We love the casual yet elegant atmosphere and the ever changing menu, dependent on the procurement of the day. That is why the menu is like a poet 'Octaphilosophy' - 8 course plus complimentary appetisers. The menu description of 'Pure, Salt, Artisan, South, Texture, Unique, Memory and Terroir' is up to Chef Andre's interpretation. There's only 30 seats in two rooms. The sitting facing the road with window is too close for romantic dinning, but wonderful if you enjoyed eavesdropping other lovers' conversations. We have been here a few times and noticed that Andre's favourite dish is his secret foie gras cream - we wish it could be taken off the menu as there's no ethical way of producing foie gras. Meal with and without wine paring is S$571 and S$350 respectively, excluding coffee/tea, it is a perfect place for romantic night out, if fine dinning is your passion
5
From the moment you arrive you feel 110% pampered only only by the competent staff but also by Chef Andre and his wife - and the long serving Japanese sommelier. It is no doubt the most innovative restaurant in Singapore, and both the variety and the presentation of the food is world class; the portion size is also just right. We found some of the tables were too close to each other, but that's obviously a challenge when you are housed in an old charming town-house. We had an interesting talk with Chef Andre regarding the sourcing of his food ingredients.This was the 2 time we had an excellent dinner here, and another good reason to support owner operated restaurants
5
Came here for a lunch with some colleagues recently and took a semi private area for 8 of us for lunch. Friendly, welcoming staff look after you very well from the moment you arrive. Lovely room for lunch with a large and wide rectangular table, quite a minimalist setting but not so stark that it feels cold or uncomfortable. The descriptions of food, the presentation and the taste was fantastic, one of the best lunches I have ever had, a really enjoyable experience. Can't wait to go back

My husabmd invited me at Andre for our 8th anniversary and it was a terrible disapointment for both of us.I'm allergic to fish and seafood, and knowing it was a fixed menu he wrote 2 months in advance and ask the chef if he could adapt the menu for me. In degustation menus there is often fish and this is even more the case in Asia. Some restaurants simply refuse to do an effort, and some really adapt the menu, sometimes with a total vegetarian version. would have understood if they had refused to do so, but they agreed and ensure him they would adapt the dishes. They did adapt... by simply removing the fish from the dishes! Only one dish was really changed (chicken instead of fish), in the other they simply removed the fish and put me 2 salad leaves instead. For example the first starter had an assortment of 6 little bouchees of fishes or seafood, I had an asparagus salad with ham :-(. Another was a risotto with vegetables and fish, they did not bother to replace the fish by something else and I just had the vegetables (not even the risotto!)And of course they charged full price for this! We told the chef about this at the end when he visited the tableand he did not even bother to apologize for this. He just left our table as if nothing has happened.On other aspects, the room is extremely noisy (too bad for a restaurant where half of patrons must be couples looking for a romantic evening). The wines were all excellent, apart that we litterally had to beg the somelier to get our glasses (we choose a wine pairing) and the servings were really small. Same here, despite knowing I'd have a different menu, he didn't bother to adapt the wines to my dishes and jsut serve me the same than for the fishy menu.So yes the dishes I tried were excellent, and yes there were some wonderful surprises in the mouth. But with this poor level of service and not caring at all for its patrons, Andre does not deserve its ranking and reputation and is absolutely overpriced.I can not recommend it to anybody and felt being completely cheated for the price
4
I would like to pin-point why I like this place:1) Amazing wines chosen by a Japanese sommelier. (we had wine paring with the course.)2) They adjusted their dishes based on my requests (vegetarian) on the spot and they were beautiful.3) Very good, professional & friendly service.and I'd love to go back to André again!I highly recommend this place during your stay in Singapore, IF YOU CAN AFFORD..

My husband took me to Andre for my birthday. We were expecting so much from the 5th restaurant in Asia, 48th restaurant in the world, and we must say that we were both absolutely disappointed.It is the first time I write a review but I felt I really had to.First of all the staff: very arrogant, unfriendly, zero sense of humor, a real pain. We could not have any romantic conversation since they kept interrupting us in order to present the dishes. So unprofessional! Overall we had the impression they were the kings leading the show and we were the stupid clients who should just be happy to be there.....As long as the shut up.Then the food: The food was just ... Average except for two dishes (oyster and foie gras which were really outstanding), over a 9 courses dinner.... Which is not much! we could not believe it. All the dishes where very creative in their presentation but the taste was so poor, so average ! The raw fish, the veggies, the desserts....everything was so disappointing... We had much better experiences at shinji by Kanesaka for the raw fish, guy savoy for the veggies or les Amis for The desserts. We paid S$1500 for 2 persons and for the same price or less, I have to say Guy Savoy is way way better. We wonder what are the criteria of this ranking
5
My boyfriend and I had our anniversary dinner here. The place was absolutely gorgeous with simple and fashionable decoration. When the food come, we were overwhelm and feel like it’s not just food anymore, but a piece of art on a plate.Chef Andre is so much a talent to create dishes that are so delicious and soulful!The price is a little expensive for dinner, but it’s definitely deserved for such a high quality service
5
A well deserved reputation .
Enjoy a unique fine dinning experience in a small chic/casual restaurant, having a wonderful meal cooked by an extremely talented chef .
A must while you are in Singapore!
5
We had lunch here and highly enjoyed the dining experience. We had expected that the restaurant would be a touch pretentious, but that was not the case. The food was beautifully presented, felt inventive and was definitely very delicious. There were some Asian influences in the ingredients and flavors, which we enjoyed. The coffee served in pottery designed by the Chef was a nice touch. We were also pleasantly surprised that Chef Andre took the time to go to every table to chat with the guests
5
The last night of our honeymoon was spent at this restaurant- a decision we definitely do not regret! We were bowled over from the moment we stepped in the door and Andre welcomed us himself into his restaurant (this has never happened in the many Michelin star restaurants that we've been to). The food was incredible, the wines exquisite. I love that there is a story behind the food, and when speaking to Andre his passion clearly shines through. Loved that Andre came to speak to all the guests - a really personal touch. Definitely recommen
5
My husband took me to Andre as a little surprise treat and we were both blown away by how very good it was. Not wanting to sound arrogant or pretentious, we tend to try different Michelin star restaurants when we travel. Andre is definitely on top with them all. Or even better! We highly recommend the wine pairing option. The champagne came from a small vineyard in France that only produces very limited bottles every year. Taste just divine! Spoil your special one, take them there and let the magic begin ...
5
This was our second visit to AndrÃ© and somehow he has managed to outdo himself and create a menu and a dining experience that was even better than last time. Literally all of the courses were done to perfection, the wines matched to the point and the service was both spotless as well as relaxed, which made us feel perfectly at home. In my eyes not one of the best, but THE best restaurant in Singapore
5
Goodness, this was not a meal, but an experience. There were two dishes I did not like, Cucumber Sorbet and another dish with white grapes, but the other 8 course or so were simply wonderful, one almost brought a tear to my eye, it was perfection on a plate, almost divine.
5
I went there with high expectations and I was definitely not disappointed. From the location to the food, everything was exceptional.Located in a historic part of town (Chinatown), the restaurant was housed in a three storey shophouse next to the boutique hotel Majestic hotel. The exterior was as classy and enticing as the interior. As soon as we walked through the door, we were greeted by very professional and obliging staff who led us to our table on the second floor. The drinks and food were not just amazing but the presentation was visually spectacular. After the meal, we were invited to meet the chef in the kitchen. Chef Andre was friendly and unassuming. He is undoubtedly one of the best chefs in Singapore and deserves all the accolades and awards he has garnered
5
While passing through Singapore and having 12 hours to kill we decided to check out Restaurant Andre after seeing them in the Pellegrino list.Quite simply we were not disappointed.We had booked in for the fixed price lunch menu and decided to add in the matching wines. The welcome was pleasant and our waiter was friendly and there when you needed him throughout the whole afternoon. The food and service were excellent and the wines were very well matched, the wines all coming from smaller boutique style French vineyards.I'm not one for detailing out everything we had to eat, but needless to say they were interesting combinations with amazing bursts of flavour and combinations. By the end of the meal we were pleasantly full but not "stuffed". I can't wait for the next time we overnight in Singapore so we can visit for dinner.For those who would like this style of food I would strongly recommend.If you have the time please go..food full of wonderful tastes, wines well matched, service friendly and attentive...just great. Restaurant Andre has what it takes to make me want to go back, not just to say I had a good meal. For us, we just can't wait to try the dinner menu
5
Restaurant Andre is in the top 50 restaurants of the world and does not disappoint. From the gorgeous fit out, to the warm hospitality, excellent service and seriously creative food the experience is first class. Yes, it's expensive - but the work that goes into the food is worth every penny. They are also incredibly generous, surprising us with a second serve of our favourite dish, sharing their tips on best places to eat in Singapore, as well as a tour of the kitchen and the story behind the restaurant on our way out. If you like fine dining, or are eating your way through the top 50 restaurants in the world this is a great addition to your Singapore experience
5
Although top notch globally recognized chefs have set up branches here, I think Andre beats them all (at least in Singapore). The food is basically modern french with an asian accent and a touch of molecular influence. Like japanese restaurants, Andre builds his meals around the produce he can get flown in fresh from Japan and other places so the meal is "omakase" style (no a la carte menu) consisting of 8 courses. The foie gras "jelly" is excellent and a standard and I always enjoy the chicken skin - so thin, it's like a crisp. He has a wonderfully unique wine list full of burgundies and devoid of bordeaux blends. Ken, the sommelier, has great taste in wines so there is an interesting selection of alternatives to the usual names. Service is refined and largely low-key (although this may come across as being somewhat aloof depending on the server), which I feel is the overall mood of the restaurant. The food is nicely presented, some on plates which Andre made/designed himself. The nice thing - which my husband appreciates (as he has ignored whatever dress code there is) - is that you can come here in a nice pair of jeans and shirt and shouldn't feel out of place. Price-wise, I think a meal would come in around SGD300 per person excluding wine. Reservations are a must - the place only seats around 40
5
I've visited Andre three times and i do find that this is the best french restaurant i've been so far.
Highly recommended!!
5
This was highly recommended by the hostel I was staying at and from what I know Chef Andre used to helm Jaan, the current number 1 restaurant on TripAdvisor. The food was absolutely amazing and no words can simply describe the pleasure of the food here

After reading raving reviews that this is probably one of the best french restuarant in Singapore i decided to make a reservation to celebrate my wife's birthday with a group of friends and family at the Chef's table. During the reservation process i informed the manager of the special occasion, how important it is, and was promised a surprise that will be duly planned. What a mistake it is to have place such trust on the team who ran this restuarant. Fastforward to the actual day and coming to the end of a reasonably good meal, the whole table waited expectantly for the surprise. Nothing came. After more than 30 mins, i realized this is going nowhere and we were looking stupid making eye contact with the waitress everytime she walks by, I went to the serving area to check on it. The shock on her face says it all. The truth came out that the restuarant has completely forgotten about the day and my request. The kitchen has been cleaned up, there was nothing left in the kitchen, not even a simple cake or biscuit that we could put a candle on and sing a birthday song to celebrate the special day for the wonderful lady. To the credit of the waitress she scrambles a birthday card, using restaurant stationery, but what an utter disappointment beyond imagination. In addition, there was no personal happy birthday wishes from staff or chef, no thank you for spending the special day with us from the staff, nothing! There was also no attempt to acknowledge the mistake, not a a word of apology offered. Andre's food was good with some fanciful names, but in my humble opinion the restaurant missed the most important element in its DNA that differentiate- human touch, honesty and respect for people. As a result, everything is blant, tasteless with a bitter aftertaste.We paid for the dinner and promptly left. Never will we return

Chef Andre has a very particular eye for detail, his attention for plates setting, choice of cutlery, decor etc.Menu is quite inventive, the 8 different philosophy.Food was average, for me personally it lacked the wow factor in the taste department except for the foie gras.It is an experience but it certainty is the one of the most expensive fine dining meals I've ever had!

Restaurant Andre is such an experience. The moment you walk into the old school Singapore style shop house, you are transported to a culinary journey that you will not regret. I must say I was pleasantly blown away with the whole experience. Since Restaurant Andre entered the World's Best Restaurants lists, I had always wanted to try the food and finally last week managed to schedule lunch with my wife. We had garlic chocolate dish with some chips which unfortunately I could not remember what it was but it was delicious. We stated off with a salad dish, sea bass with prawns and smoked eel. But the main highlight to me was the Foie Gras Jelly with black truffle, absolutely to die for and as I understood from the serving staff one of Chef Andre's signature dishes for a very long time. The main dish of Kurobuta Pork and Oyster was great but I am not a big fan of oysters so the highlight for me is still the foie gras jelly. All in all would I come back again, a definite yes

This is “The Emperors New Cloths” The staff was very unprofessional would not answer simple conversional questions. The sommelier would not even speak to my wife and she tried 3 times. I understand we are in Asia but this is just not done.The story with the food as been done before by others and is not new or experimental. Each course had more story then substance or presentation. It is sad when you ask to speak to the chief and are told that he is out of town and nobodies is in charge.It is just a disappointing experience at any pric

This place is all about creating a journey with fresh ingredients and allowing diners to taste the flavours .. Before I go on, lets just get something straight.. It's very expensive and that's certainly not why I rate it Excellent.. In fact I nearly rate it lower for that very reason but what I am about to explain will in my opinion justify the rating I decided on. For anyone expecting to pig out with quantity or if you are a fussy eater, you might as well not bother.. You are not going to get to order.That said, if you are a foody, adventurous and willing to spend some money on a special occasion than this is a perfect place! Let me start with my reservation. I sent an email from London before my trip and requested some options and promptly got a response the next day from the GM Stepan and very accommodating with my request. On the day, we arrived slightly early and promptly greeted by the hostess. The restaurant is at the edge of Chinatown in one of a row of beautifully restored coloniel shop houses. The building has been tastefully done up on the outside and in with a comfortable sitting area while waiting or our table. We were quickly offered and served champaign and offered to go up to the table early if we wish.As soon as we sat down, Stepan was there to explain the concept and how the journey flows. The little booklet on the side of each diner will only explain the concept of each dish and the rest will be left as a surprise. Each dish came with a different surprise that really tease your palet from sea water foam with hidden oyster to risotto served with fruits seafood. It really was quite an experience and you can tell lots of thoughts went into the design and care in the preparation. What I like most is that they ont use seasoning but rather use the right ingredients combination to bring out the flavours. The wine pairing in my mind were just perfect for each dish not over powering but goes really well with the texture and flavours of the food. They are quite happy to top you up as well if you are a fast drinker.. If you are a non alcohol drinker, there is a juice pairing as well with a range of really unique mixture and my mum took that option which she enjoyed very much.Overall a really great experience.. It's a place that you come to experience a journey of food in a relaxed environment and properly taste each flavours and texture of their dish. Each table is only for one cover each night so you can really just take your time.. One thing I hate most about many nice restaurants is the 2 hour dining limit which isn't the case here.As a nice finishing touch, we were lead downstairs via the lift which opens to a viewing window into the kitchen which wa nice. Pity we didn't meet Andre but it was nice to see where the creations happen. I felt unfair if I were to rate this Very Good simply on the price because you'd expect this coming to a restaurant like this one and I really couldn't think of any fault even if I were to be picky which I normally am so this is deserving of an Excellent as far as I am concern

For the Aussies out there Tetsuya's in Sydney is of course the best degustation in Australia (we've been twice it's that good). Well if you loved that you will love this. Same sort of (statospheric) cost but brilliant food and the matched wine flight is well worth it. Staff knowledgeable, helpful and friendly: our waiter was French and had done 3 months at Vue De Monde - and it showed. A request for a top up of the wine (numerous) was always met with pleasant agreement - eventually he just did it without asking. Yes the portions are small but there are 12 of them and the flavours, textures and visual effect is wonderful - my wife ate oysters for the first time in her life. Go if you possibly can but hold your breath when the bill comes

This is a fantastically expensive, chic restaurant. Aroung $1000 Sing for two, with a cheaper wine option.The place is small, "shop house" Singapore style, and comfortable. The service is lovely: friendly, and knowledgeable. But the food? Well, almost invisible. Tiny tiny fragments of seafood are presentted in a range of beautiful plates, but beauty is the game here, not taste. Go for an occasion, or to reduce your cash surplus, but not for an actual meal. The latter is an exercise in self indulgence by the "chef" (as called by staff in reverential tones throughout), and of course not a bad money spinner either

Took my wife here for her birthday. It's in an unusual setting but service was fantastic. We dealt with 3 members of staff who were all informative on the menu and wine list and gave the right level of customer service. Friendly without becoming too overbearing. The food itself is different from anything else I have experienced. It was all first class. Some of the tastes were extraordinary and all were prepared to the highest level. Some complaints on here about quantity but I can honestly say I was full at the end of the meal and I have a belly that takes a bit of feeding!However it is also the most expensive meal I have had in my life and I have dined at some world renowned restaurants. So is it worth it? I think no food, no matter how exquisite , is worth that amount of money.Am I glad I went? Definitely. Would I go again? Only if someone else is paying! :

Amazing dinner ! Fresh top graded ingredients, good combination of tastes, fantastic staff , with unexpected surprises. Slightly pretentious, yes, but still worth re-visit.
5
Great restaurant with excellent food and an interesting wine list. The exploration of 8 flavorsand and then desert was a great theme and the fresh produce, in particular the excellent seafood, meant that the meal was exceptional - salt and fresh were our favourites. We had the matching wines with we're different and well chosen starting with a Chablis was a surprising choice but the wine worked well. Chef Andre came and said hello at the end of the meal which was a nice touch in these days of landlord chef
5
This restaurant blew us away... The service was the BEST we had experienced anywhere in the world! Stepan, GM, quickly sorted a booking mix up and had us meeting Andre at the end of the AMAZING experience! Would we go back??? YES YES YES... If you've been to Vue De Monde and loved it.... and you happen to be in Singapore... GO HERE!!!! It is a cute little place that can be a little hard to find.. Every night is a surprise and we did the wine matching... AWESOME!!! GO GO GO

Fine dining extraordinaire, very expensive but worth it. Over the top pretensions but hey what the hell? It was all part of the theatre of serving beautifully cooked, exquisitely prepared and flamboyantly presented dishes. I like the fact that although there is only one menu, diners' tastes are catered to, in the case of people who don't like raw seafood or pink game. Full marks for being very flexible with their wine pairing and choice of dishes. Arrogant chef owned restaurants should take note that a world class chef like Andre will actually consider diners' wants first as opposed to many European chefs who prefer to impose their will on their paying customers! The staff are all very helpful and charming especially the sommelier who has an amazing working knowledge of his cellar. There is a shorter and cheaper lunch time degustation menu available. Make a reservation as early as you can as they are fully booked most of the time. Also the restaurant is not easy to find as they are set back from the road and not very well lit. It is on stage right of the Metropolitan (?) Hotel. If you can only afford one expensive meal in Singapore, make it Restaurant Andre. You will not be disappointed. Amongst the numerous fine dining restauants in Singapore, it is the best

My wife and I enjoy fine dining and have eaten at many of the "temples" of gastronomy ( Alinea, The Fat Duck, Celler de Can Roca, etc.). Thus, we were exceptionally happy (and somewhat surprised ) to enjoy such a fantastic meal at Restaurant Andre in Singapore. It certainly ranked up there with any of the meals that we have enjoyed throughout the world. There are several things to keep in mind before making a reservation. This is not just a meal, but more of a culinary "experience", so approach with an open mind. There is not a menu, so you are served what the chef prepares (The waiter does ask for any food allergies or particular dislikes). It is not inexpensive ( With the accompanying wine flight, our bill was approximately S$600 per person). However, if you want a truly exceptional meal that artfully engages the visual, textural and gustatory aspects of cuisine, then I highly recommend this restaurant. If I have a minor complaint, it is that the wine pours are quite small, but otherwise, brilliant

We visited Restaurant Andre for lunch after reading numerous recommendations from various sources. The food and service were both excellent and the value for money at lunch was fairly good at 130 SGD. The wine list was mostly very expensive even compared to Australian prices, so the total cost could very easily blow out with a decent bottle or two.My favourite courses were the "Imperial Tsar Salmon lightly smoked, tomato and peach salad, basil flower sorbet" which was beautifully plated and had delicate flavours with lots of texture and the basil flower sorbet providing a refreshing element and the "Wild mushroom polenta bianca, 36 hour slow roast short rib beef, potato and onion" which didn't really have a twist, it was just delicious. The dessert course sounded good on paper, but didn't really come together for me and I thought it was the weakest of the dishes and probably the only misstep.This was a very strong lunch overall and I left impressed. The dinner menu is supposed to be more ambitious and I would like to try it, but at around 3 times the cost of lunch there are a number of other places I would like to visit first
5
This was perhaps the best meal we have ever had (at least in a long time) as good as the likes of Daniel in NY (different but as good).Loved the building, the dining rooms and all the food and wine - which by the way I did not think was too expensive for Asia.Highly recommend this place.Loved it.The only negative comment would be on the waiter who thought he was kevin Cosner from the Bodyguard. ear piece and all. he was hard to understand and a bit OTT.PS It is expensive expect about $S500 per head including drinks on a Friday or Saturda
5
Choose this place for a special occasion. If you don't have one, visit here will become one. The place is very high end, and rightly so. Taste and attention to detail are impeccable. The experience is complete with the entourage, sounds, smells, space, pottery, colors, air temperature et cetera all carefully orchestrated to create a united whole. Let the food speak for itself
5
Tiny restaurant near ChinaTown, very cosy ambiance, super service, and impeccable and inventive food.For those who dined at Jade on 36 back to Paul Pairet's time (2007), it is one of these great experiences, of very inventive food, personal approach and perfect and incomparable result.Can't wait to go back.One of my favorite place in Singapore.Only bemol, I wish the Foie gras would be served earlier, as I was not able to fully appreciate it at that point.Also, we had behind us a table with 4 men, talking quite loudly, and privacy is not optimized (would be good with some music maybe, so tables cannot benefit from next table conversations
5
Probably the best restaurant I have ever encountered. Ten courses of the finest food I have ever had the priviledge to eat coupled with ten superb French house wines each selected by Andre to compliment his superb dishes. Andre uses elements to describe his servings each serving representing either water, fire wind ect . It was a great experience and is highly recommended to any traveller
5
very well prepared, pinnacle of flavor brought out with every mouthful,great service and explanation of every dish

While in Singapore to participate in the Ironman, I was lucky enough to enjoy dinner at Andre.
Gorgeous food, amazing combinations, second to none staff.
The sommelier sure knows his wines and combinations and contributed to a perfect evening!
5
Have tried few times in this tiny restaurant near to China Town... Chef Andre is incredibly talented and the service crew with impeccable service. They have interesting wine selection as well. Reservation is hard to get, so have to book early.In my opinion, this is the best modern French restaurant in Singapore and possibly the best in Asia (apart from couple of my other favorites in Tokyo)

Turned up to restaurant Andre not knowing anything about the cost of the meal but knowing it was one of the best restaurants in the world and having eaten similar types of degustation meals had a rough idea of costs. The food was outstanding and we were not left hungry! The combinations of foods were sensational. The price of the food was what we expected but were a bit taken back with the alcohol. We were never shown a wine list and not really given the choice not to have the paired wines. We had five glasses of wine which were nice but not outstanding they alone cost 190 sing dollars. We may have still chosen this option in retrospect but would have been nice to have known the cost beforehand and also seen what wines by the glass were on offer. So just be cautious about making a decision about drinks before seeing the menu or checking the prices! The bill came to 1200 sing dollars for two which was probably a bit over priced for what it was
4
My girlfriend and I had a lovely evening at Andre's. The food was excellent and the service very warm and friendly. Special mention should go to Stepan (head waiter), Tomas and Ken (sommelier) who were both very attentive. The wine pairing is a great way to try the different wines with each course. The price is steep but reflects the effort made with each dish by the kitchen. Overall a very enjoyable experience.

We loved Andre when he was at Jaan...He is one of the more creative and talented chefs of his generation. I only waited until now to go to his own restaurant, and the experience was mixed. There is a lot of brilliance in the conception of the dishes. There is tremendous effort, from the army of waiters (plus as I understand, lots of people in the kitchen) to attention to details (website, artsy menu and wine list, etc). The food itself is also quite good. However, to perfect molecular cuisine, you need more experience, and I think Andre doesn't have it yet...This is definitely no Fat Duck or The Bazaar! (Andre is less of a specialized molecular place, but still he attempts some of it..) Because of restaurant Andre's small size and the law of economics, the price of dinner is nearly as high as a meal at The Fat Duck (where you have a much more fun and amazing experience!). Incidentally, the service, while friendly and eager, still shows lack of experience for a restaurant in this class (it's all in the small details!). I am confident that with time, Andre will be a giant in this business, and am glad to be part of his maturing

I booked Andre 2 months ahead through email for 12 of us. We were flying in to Singapore for the dinner at 8pm and 10 of my friends have not been to Andre before. They were going to Andre based on my recommendation. It was my second time. One week before the dinner date, I email the restaurant and much to my horror was informed that the restaurant was closed for an event. (Restaurant Andre did not even have the decency to inform me ahead of time). We had already booked our airline tickets. After a flurry of sms to the manager, in which I threatened never to go to Andre again and will tell everyone I know what they did, Andre management had a meeting, a change of mind and accommodated us. However, the dinner would be at 8.45pm instead and they would put us in the library on the 3rd floor. They also told us if we want to come at 8pm, they would provide a bottle of champagne while we are waiting at the hotel next door. When we were about to start the champagne, our table was ready at 8.45pm. So we didn't get to enjoy it.The food was good. Everyone enjoyed it. However, the service was mediocre. There were many times I had to get up to pour the wine. Somehow the waiter/waitress was either slow or not alert enough to sense the situation. We finished eating at 12 midnight because our reservation was pushed back 45 minutes.The reservation ordeal left a bitter taste. I found out that Andre was hosting a corporate event that evening. It seems that the restaurant was willing to disregard individual customers in favor of larger corporate event and break its commitment. It didn't matter if we had booked much earlier then the corporates

On a recent trip to Singapore we were lucky enough to be able to experience the gastronomic delights of chef Andre, born in Taiwan and trained in Paris. He has a brigade of 12 in his kitchen & it shows as every morsel was a taste sensation. He combines ingredients that delight the taste-buds and trick the eye. The whole menu was visually stunning, pieces of art. Yes, the portions are small, as one of the reviews say, I say you'd want them to be as there are about 9 courses that are presented to you. The waiting staff are attentive and very knowledgable about every detail of the menu. A wonderful experience
5
It is pricey, but we decided to splurge on a fancy meal and were so glad we did. The food was nothing short of amazing. every plate that was presented to us was followed by a story which was such a nice touch, when you know what inspired the dish, and what significance it has to the chef. the wine matching was perfect (i would highly recommend matching wines with the meal). The service as professional, friendly and 5 star, everyone knew what they were doing and they do it so well, wonderful atmosphere to go with the wonderful food. Chef Andre is a culinary genius supported by fantastic staff. I highly recommend a visit to this restaurant for a special night out.
2
I guess we should have stuck to Asian food, but the Tripadvisor reviews for Andre sounded pretty good so off we went.We were seated quickly our menu came and then we waited for about 15 minutes while water came, menus came and finally a waiter to take our order. The place was mostly empty so I dont know why the service was so slow.The food finally came after another 15 minutes. Strong tastes but absolutely tiny portions. A few courses of that and I was getting annoyed. Eventually the bill came and I was dismayed.A total waste of time and far far too expensive. Don't do it to yourselves
5
Unique experience with special touch of service and wonderfull staff knowledge. It was just perfect.
Thank you very much!!!

The bill was astronomic!! This pretentious restaurant has a Chef that is trying to be a Michellin star Chef but in my pinion, he will NEVER make it. The food was very mediocre, the service was slow and the Chef didn't even have the decency to come and say hello (the restaurant is super small!). I have been to anumber of Michelin starred restaurants, among them "El Bulli", when it was operating, and Ferran or his brother Albert were always super kind and so was the service. Mr Andre, I wish you a lot of luck, your attitude is completely out of place, step down from your pedestal and either improve or close

My husband an I visited Singapore recently and wanted to treat ourselves to a nice meal. We looked at the Tripvisor, and Andre's Restaurant sounded very nice.We were given a little table on the first floor. The wine waiter came to chat with us and recommended a very nice bottle of white wine. We ordered our food and when it came we both said 'it looks too good to eat'. And then we said 'but where's the rest of it !'. The portions were very small, but the food tasted wonderful - things we had very tried before and course after course after course of them.The trouble with this meal was that the portions were tiny - we don't have big appetites but came away hungry. And when the bill came we were truly shocked - the wine was well over £60 and with all the tax and other fees the bill was huge.I suppose Andre's Restaurant fills a need for people with far wallets and small appetites, but not for us
3
Dont get me wrong but the food here is good and the restaurant has a great atmosphere but The service for me personally was very slow however they were busy so can be to angry about that. Not the cheapest place to eat and perhaps not the best but there are so many choices in Singapore no need to worr

A million thanks to Andre Chiang's Octaphilosophy : [ The hypothesis of eight characteristics that attempt to discover through cuisine; the nature and significance of ordinary and scientific beliefs while investigating the simplicity of concepts by means of rational argument concerning their presumptions, implications, and interrelationships. The pure and unique hues of nature’s gifts from the land together with scientific research are juxtaposed alongside with the intuitions of the South, where primal aromas and texture evoke the endless trail of memories.] It was such a delight and it was my privilege and prestige that I was able to enjoy such a wonderful evening.the eight-course degustation menu was excellent enough to evoke the similar feelings of joy when traveling in milan, italy
5
chef andré's dishes are the epitome of haute cuisine in Singapore, and it's by no means an exaggeration. the menu could do with more frequent changes, visiting more than twice in the same month means you'll probably be served a few of the same dishes from your last visit. otherwise, it's always a pleasant experience
3
The 2nd floor part of the restaurant was too small, table was small that you dont have a space for your bread plate and you could hear the other peoples conversation from the next table. Sommelier is less than impressive, we tried to pick several wines we liked but it seems they dont have a stock of those and he keeps pointing the ones that were 3x the price of what we previously picked. So not cool. We waited for a long time to get the first glass from the champagne we picked, about 20 min. Staff are too stiffed, the guy who were serving us talked very fast and it seems he had a forced Aussie accent and it was very difficult to understand what he was trying to explain. Food is well thought and most of it were pretty good but just over priced for such kind of restaurant. Weve been to a 2 Star Michelin star restaurant in Barcelona but we never paid such price

Housed in a beautiful heritage building in Singapore, Andre looks like a distinguished establishment. We were greeted at the door and accompanied to our table which required us to take the lift to the upper floors. The interior decor has been carefully thought out and gives you the feeling of being in someone's private dining room. No menu as such is provided but a small list of Andre's cooking themes is provided. We enjoyed numerous courses which were very pleasant to the eye but lack the wow factor we expected from such a fine dining restaurant. Every course was obviously carefully thought through but Andre's search for imaginative dishes was let down by blandness and ridiculously small portions. The 'main course' as it was described when served up was so small that I have eaten bigger canapés! The kitchen was somewhat deceitful in announcing that we had been upgraded to a rabbit dish when they had in fact run out of the lamb main course. The wine list however and the sommelier were fantastic! Andre's sommelier has managed to fill the cellar with delicious boutique French wines that are very unique to Singapore and exquisite
5
I love this restaurant because they cook very well,we have tried so much course , Each course was delightful and engaged all the senses: taste, sight, smell and feel. I do not want to spoil the surprise elements of the dishes but I wanted to highlight the 3 dishes that stood out to me: (1) Black truffle cream with foie gras jelly, (2) Black chicken egg, morelle and jerome mushrooms, Iberico ham, black truffles and silver onions, and (3) deconstructed snickers bar.love to come back agai
5
A top class restaurant with a master chef at the top of the game in Asia. Contemporary cooking (think Fat Duck or El Bulli here) by Andre Chiang and his brigade that is in the absolutely top class of world restaurantsEvery dish a work of art in all sensesLocated in a small three story house near Chinatown, immaculate furnishings and helpful staff - the somelier was a joy - helpful and not the usual arrogant type.The price is VERY high - but if you want a world class meal then it's worth every penn

Chef Andre has helmed this eponymous restaurant for 1.5yrs serving Southern French nouvelle cuisine since leaving Jaan par Andre. He has definitely took it up a notch in artistic expression to be worthy of 2 Michelin Stars according to my palate. From the 4 course lunch my companion and I had, this is unsurpassed culinary expressions in Singapore. He takes his ingredients from fresh produce every day and fashion an experience that is elegant but not stuffy, visually appealing but not contrived and tasty but not overly abstract. No question he puts a lot of heart into his cooking. Forgotten Vegetable was a plate of exquisitely fresh veggies, finished off with grilled calamari in a shellfish stock. The contrast between the baby calamari and the baby veggies made it sailed above the mundane 'gourmet' food. The reconstructed snickers bar which we had for dessert was most interesting in texture and purity - chilled to a temperature to have chocolate and caramel tastes come through and yet maintained the crunchiness of the peanuts and biscuits. What a delicate balance! I understand that he even designed his own crockery which supports his whole personality. The interior has muted tones and understated elegance that allows a calm sense of well being to pervade the diners. Whether it is catching up between good friends or important business guests or lovers, Andre certainly delivered an experience that is memorable, relaxed, elegant and refined. Bravo
5
We spent an amazing evening at André's.Right from the very first moment of stepping into the restaurant (and being greeted by name even though it was our first visit there), everything was simply perfect.The food - as many have written already, it's not à la carte, but a degustation menu - came in 12 carefully selected courses, all arranged to fit into different food philosophies. The tastes were wonderfully assembled and the presentation was the best I've ever seen. André is truly an artist.For the wines, we chose the sommelier's suggestion of accompanying wines, which have been perfectly matched to the courses.The service is the best I've had in Singapore so far.All in all, a great evening indeed

We ate at Restaurant Andre in February 2012. The restaurant's website is not very informative so we were somewhat surprised to find that Andre offers only a degustation menu- there is no a la carte which means you eat what you are given. In a first, in my experience, there is also no choice of wine- all of it comes from a French vineyard, proudly described by the staff as small and not well known. The waiter was eager to encourage us to have wines paired withthe food, which I declined as I did not wish to drink a great deal. I asked for a glass of chardonnay which turned out to be thin and tart. When I mentioned this to the sommelier he assured me that I must be wrong and that the wine was actually very subtle with flavours of peach, apricot etc etc. I still thought it tasted thin and tart.Each of the dishes was preceded by a lengthy commentary from the waiter, describing how complex tit was and what a genius chef was in producing it. In the case of one dish we were told that the chef had not only produced the food but, in an overflow of creative genius, had also made the plates. I found the food too tizzed up and few of the dishes were inviting as food to eat. The dessert was a particular disappointment: chocolate ice cream plus a few chocolately bits and pieces.I would have dismissed all of this as pretentious and undistinguished dining were it not for the bill- a staggering $ Sing 900 for two of us.Citizens of Singapore, Restaurant Andre is having a lend of yo

Been to Andre twice so here are my thoughts:I tend to be wary of establishment providing haute cuisine. I am not a fan of foam and molecular gastronomy. I definitely prefer simple traditional taste. Nevertheless, there is something about Andre that made me go back a second time and quite likely in future as well. First, there is no compromise to the taste of the dishes despite their artisanal presentation. How did he infuse such intense flavors in the fanciful looking morsels? Second, Andre himself seems like a really nice and friendly chap.Third, this is a wheel-chair friendly place. There is a nice lift to go up to the upper floor if the reserved table is not on the ground floor. Only issue is the short flight of stairs at the front of the restaurant but the staff are always keen to help.There is no particular dish to recommend here as the menu is largely decided by Andre, unless there is a particular dietary restriction - for which the chef will prepare an alternative. Dress-code: Business casual. This is a nice place to bring your date for a special evening. If you are the introverted type, it may be a good idea to let the food do most of the talking
4
We dined here the other night with great expectations and whilst we had a very pleasant evening there was certainly no wow factor with the food.The menu is determined by Andre and yes there are several courses all beautifully presented and executed. However where the restaurant falls down is that there are too many flavours on the plate all competing for attention with the palate. Sometimes the addage "less is more" is very true.The service is impeccable though I have to say the waiter seems to rush through the ingredients.Would we go there again at $S700.00... probably not though I am glad we had the experience
5
We came for lunch and there was a mix-up with our reservation. However, being ever gracious, the manager offered us a seating and offered to let us try to dinner tasting menu during lunch time. We quickly agreed and were started with warm bread. There were different words to describe the different courses and it was a cool way to think about the menu.Pure - scallop ravioli with dill, seaweed, purple cauliflower and shallots. This dish had the nice flavor of scallop and the purple broth underneath had a strong cauliflower taste. There was no added seasoning to the food, hence the name pure.Salt - oyster water mixed with seaweed and granny smith apple foam. There was no salt added to the dish and the mix of the brininess of the oyster with the sour and sweet of apple was a good contrast.Artisan - aubergine from Kyoto, caviar from China, vegetable chips, and duck tongue from France. The duck tongue was good and the caviar was OK but small. My favorite part of this dish was the chips.South - heirloom tomatoes served on the left and seafood served on the right. The tomato sorbet was light and fit well with the heirloom tomatoes. There was sliced, cured harami with tomato that had great taste. Part of the dish included young coral, which tasted like the ocean, creamy razor clams, Spanish prawns, and seared mackerel. The raw red snapper was delicious.Texture - deconstructed squid risotto. The squid was cut into a risotto shape and the risotto was made into a crunchy chip and this was served with shaved cheese on side. This was a cool way to reverse the squid and the risotto and it tasted great.Unique - black chicken egg baked for an hour, topped with Iberico ham, morel mushrooms, truffle and veal jous. The egg was 20% white & 80% yolk and the richness of egg and truffle was spectacular together.Memory - has been the same course for 13 years, black truffle reduction over a foie gras jelly. The dish was very rich, very satisfying, and it was interesting to have just before the end of the meal, which was the perfect place to have this dish.Terroir - wagyu beef with natural beef au jous, dried garlic, mustard seeds, green pea reduction, dried olives and Chinese artichoke. There was great marbling on the beef and the accoutrements were good with the meat. However, this dish was not as great as some of the others. The palate cleanser was toasted rice mousse, toasted wheat, hay ice cream and burata cheese which was an interesting mix of flavors. I've never had hay ice cream before and it was OK. The dessert was a Snickers deconstruction, which was OK. I'm not sure why they need to deconstruct a Snickers in Singapore for dessert. The petits fours were popcorn with pop rocks and chocolate, passion fruit marshmallow, and grapefruit jelly. We ended with madelines made of hazelnut and honey which were light, warm and fluffy.The service was excellent as was the meal. Prepare for a few hours if you want the tasting menu and book in advance for your table
4
We went for lunch. There is no a la carte menu - only the degustation menu was available at about S$130 per person. The food was excellent and the service was good. Due to the acoustics of the restaurant and the limited space between tables, the restaurant can be noisy and conversations between other diners were audible. The wine, priced at S$40 for a glass of red wine and S$30 for a glass of white wine, was reasonably pleasant but seemed overpriced. This is a place to enjoy imaginative and well-prepared food, but not for quiet conversation over a glass of wine. Finding a parking space outside can be challenging, but the valet services at S$5 was very decent

Went for my wife's 40th and it was an amazing experience. Food-wise not Fat Duck but the service was better and atmosphere calm & relaxed, not pretentious. The "story" was interesting and the food was very good although one dish didn't work so well; presentation in all cases was excellent. Not somewhere for those with kids but perfect for a special romantic evening or important business lunch/dinner

Had dinner at Andre with my brother and 2 close friends. The restaurant only offers a 8 course tasting menu (which actually works out to 15 or 16 courses if you include the extras served between the courses and the 2 or 3 dessert courses that were not included in the formal 8 courses described as Octaphilosophy. We also opted for the wine pairing which consisted of a champagne, 2 whites, 2 reds and 1 fortified dessert wine; all the wines were french and the pairings worked very well.Each course was delightful and engaged all the senses: taste, sight, smell and feel. I do not want to spoil the surprise elements of the dishes but I wanted to highlight the 3 dishes that stood out to me: (1) Black truffle cream with foie gras jelly, (2) Black chicken egg, morelle and jerome mushrooms, Iberico ham, black truffles and silver onions, and (3) deconstructed snickers bar.Dinner with then paired wines will set you back $500 per head but, to me, it is money well spent on a wonderful and adventurous dining experience. I am already looking forward to coming back again

I had the unbelievable pleasure to be treated to dinner by friends visiting from Australia, at Restaurant Andre last night. My friends had read about the restaurant whilst back in Australia, where a famous chef had described it as one of the best restaurants in the world!! And he was not wrong ... being in the food & beverage industry I have had meals in some amazing places all around the world and I must say this is one of, if not the best I have experienced. If the 8 (plus extras) gastronomique delight does not excite you, then the unique and yet fine french wine paired will ... not to mention the friendly and professional service, the whole experience is (I am still living it) truly amazing. This is not just about tasting food & wine this is the full package and a must for all you so called foodies!! The restaurant is split in 3 levels, we were in the "library" or attic and you really felt as if you were at home ... every detail is taken care of, and the works of art are not only what is served to you, but the plates it is served on and throughout the restaurant!Words escape me with regards to describing the food, and for all of us it was almost impossible to pick a favourite, albeit the foie gras was to die for!! I personally have an allergy to fish ... and Chef Andre was not only accomodating to this but some of my "replacement" dishes out did the "real" thing! As I did not pay the bill I can advise with regards to the cost, but I did know it cost SGD180.00 to have the wines paired (6 glasses in total, plus a top up here and there) and if you consider the cost of one bottle of wine I find this extremely reasonable ... and to have the opportunity to try so many different wines all equal quality why not?? Again it just adds to the overall experience ...I will no doubt be returning, it is a must for any foodie, and a real experience for the rest of us ... a place to impress & really enjoy, not just for the food but an amazing dining experience

Top notch food, great and friendly service and a unique but nice dining room make this a great choice for lunch or dinner. Innovative and changing menu means you won't get bored.

Went for lunch.
His food at Jaan was better.
A step back I think.

Restaurant Andre is located @ Bukit Pasoh. The nearest train station is Outram Train Station, North-East Line/Purple line. I tried the set lunch @ S$128 (excluding taxes and service charge). The food is exquisite though the portions are really small. I was most impressed with a capellini dish (forgot the name!). There would usually be a different consomme dish to serve as a palate cleanser. Definitely worth a try if you feel like treating yourself. :

Dining at Restaurant Andre is akin to visiting an Arts Gallery displaying Culinary Masterpieces by Chef Andre. Almost everything in the restaurant is a piece of art. From the intricately designed decor, to the china (handmade by Chef) used to present the food, to the picturesque food plating and finally the excellent execution of cooking techniques. I enjoyed admiring the wonderfully plated dishes as much as savouring the food. The 8-course meal was based on eight elements, each inspired by Chef's experience in his culinary journey.

Having dined at chef Andre Chiang's previous restaurant atop the Swisshotel twice before, this was the second time we've been to his very stylish eponymous establishment in Chinatown. Chef Andre has coined the term 'octaphilosophy' to describe his approach to cuisine and his dishes in the full-on eight course tasting menu (plus many extras!) exemplify one particular aspect of his approach to cooking and showcase his well developed French and Asian influences. The ultimate is his signature 'deconstructed Snickers' bar. You think you don't have room for it, but you do! Look up feast in the dictionary and there should be a picture of this restaurant. One great addition would be a list of the dishes once the meal is over, just to be able to discuss, recall and drool. Great staff, a lovely ambience and an exceptionally talented chef

We celebrated a birthday dinner at Andre. It was a wonderful dinning experience Great atmosphere and excellent food from the degustation menu designed by Chef Andre who is amongst one of the top chef in the world. Well worth the money. A fantastic culinary adventure not to be missed

Andre can challenge some of the best chefs in the world, and the service in the restaurant is excellent. If ever there is a michelin star system in singapore, this restaurant is definitely 3 star. The dining experience far exceeds some of the celebrity chefs restaurants in marina bay sands, which are very commercial and below par food quality/service

Service : As good as any celebrity restaurant, staff were knowledgeable and service-oriented, polished act.Ambience : Nice, cosy, warm....The old shophouse which has a historical meaning in Singapore's history makes this an excellent place for setting up what is probably Singapore's best restuarant to be helmed by a local boy....Food : First, the mandatory french butter. Served unsalted, which is a surprise for those of us used to traditional french cuisine. Though it was handmade, but we felt it paled in comparison to those imported French butter esp Sur Mer ones with Normandy sea salt. But the main attraction : 26 courses over 3.5 hours sounds like a long feast and it really is! Some were clear winners,,,some were woh!!! some were traditional french cooking bordering on the heavy side and the order of the food could be better arranged. Some courses have too much of the mashed potato gratin sauce back to back that towards the middle of the feast, we realised we hit a wall with potatoes,,,and wished for something lighter or something sour to cleanse our otherwise heavy palette..... Ingredients used were top-notch and could not be faulted.The petit fours have nice arrangement but were so-so on taste.Overall, this S$500 per head dinner offers excellent value for money and a peak into the exciting new modern world of French cuisine,,,of deconstructing and reconstructing familiar and yet exotic flavours,,,,but 26 courses is a mit too much to experience all in one go,,,,it didnt leave us any room to want for more or to return soon unlike Santi. But Andre shows how far Singapore culinary scene has come since the days of Les Amis (traditional heavy French dining) which is so passe these days. We wished we had less courses so that we can leave with our heads giddy over some of the clear winners but we were lost after this feast,,,Andre is clearly highly creative and talented and has the full repetraur to be a Michellin chef, but a bit more boldness and confidence will surely let him come full circle. Will be exciting to watch as time goes by

Again, where I can go for a good decent food where I can find a good atmosphere. I finalized pick this one, restaurant andre. It is in the middle of nowhere in china town, but it wasn't too hard to find since it is situated just right next to New Majestic Hotel. The reservation lady told me to look for the olive tree in front of the restaurant. I did and found it.  Ok that was about finding restaurant part, now the food. Chef introduced all his menu throughout his eight character, so we totally had about 8 courses plus snacking, pre-dessert, dessert and a petit four. (16 dishes in total!!!!) My night began with snacking combined of fish and ship(deconstructed), Porcini tart, pop corn and chicken skin. it was so tasty and yum. Then, follow up by Pure dish, a scallop in thin slice roll with chive and purple cauliflower consommé. It was so pure, no salt, no pepper. Follow up by South, a big plumb served with salt water gelee and sea water grapes. DELICIOUS!!!! Artisan – Kyoto eggplant with cock comb and duck tongue. I’ve never eaten cock comb before but actually it worked quite well with crème Anglais. Next, south of France – a salad of tomato and peach with lots of interesting seafood like cure hirame and risotto with uni – so rich, the taste of the flavor from the sea was just a memorable. I started to get full, but I was told by the manager that, “There are a lot more to come!” OMG!!! Suddenly, unique arrived – the dish was my favorite! It was a artichoke with baby barracuda and white wine sauce. The acidity of white wine sauce, the saltiness of sear baby barracuda - So delicious and you bet! I was in ecstasy….. Memory – WOW – hot foie-gras jelly with truffle collie - you have to try this little cup on your own and you understand why is WOW!!! Next was main course, milk fed welsh lamb served with a cannel of mustard seed, 2 lines of pea puree and pine nut. It was truly terror taste like the menu on the table described, masculine, earthy, succulent. The meat was melted in my mouth………hmmm.. The pre-desert was quite fun. Chef served me the deconstruction of strawberry yogurt which was quite refreshing. Followed up by his masculine chocolate dessert with burn butter ice-cream!!!!!! Nop! My night wasn’t finished just yet. I ordered coffee – my black came on the unusual cup called, “dependent cup” it was very cute cup. The coffee arrived with a petit-four, it was very interesting combined of pop-rock white chocolate – so yummy, something that I always hates the smell but it was very good here was bell pepper with passion fruit marshmallow, Churo with lemon sugar dipped with lemon curd!  What did I forget? The wine is quite reasonable here. 180 for 5 glasses wine pairing. All of the wine were biodynamic natural wine, so if you think you like a big brand name which come with a big bucks. You won't find it here. Like French said, we should appreciate what is in the bottle, NOT what is on the label. I also believe it that way. I don’t care who said what, but for me this is one of the BEST restaurant in the world What they served, attention to details, compared to how much I paid was well worth. I do not think that I can find any other restaurant in Singapore that can compete with Andre’s food quality, services, and prize. Bravo Andre. I shall be back soon..

The food was stunning - even though I didn't personally like all the dishes, I could appreciate the enormous skill that went into creating them. A fantastic experience.The building, the decor and the waitstaff were all fabulous.The let-down for us was the "paired wines" - at a cost of $180 per person (no - we didnt' realise the cost when we selected the paired wine option - silly us). The pours were scant and no refills, one of the wines was particularly unpleasant - apparently a Sancerre which prides itself on being chemical free. It tasted and looked like it was oxidised - bring on the chemicals is all I can say. The sommelier made no apology and no effort to replace the glass of wine (no, I didnt drink it). A very small additional glass of red wine was charged at $40 per glass - so be very, very careful about asking for an extra one. The Sommeliar was particularly coy or thought he was adding to our experience by not being at all forthcoming about what it was we were drinking - where it was from or what grape despite asking several times, It got to be damn annoying to tell the truth. Maybe we just missed the point?The bill was humungous. If we had any idea the wines were going to be that much, we would have ordered a bottle of something we liked. To be honest, we've never had this problem before with pairings - wherever we have elected to go with that option, the pairings have been spot on and great value. Not so at Andre, I'm afraid.We were charged for 2 bottles of water sparkling water although we barely drank one bottle. Not the sort of place you feel comfortable about quibblilng over how many bottles you drank but annoying none-the-less. Frankly the bill was so huge, one bottle of water was neither here nor there.Would we go back - no. The sommeliar kind of ruined the experience for us but the food was amazing
