This is my family ‘s favourite dinning cafe. Even the picky eater like my grand niece enjoys eating there. Was there at lunch time today and discovered that on sat and Sunday they have daily specials . Instead of ordering our usual favourite dishes we had one of their two daily specials - nasi lemak. I love the lemak rice which the rich coconut taste and the ikan bilis. The Chef explained that she makes sure that the ikan bilis are not oily. I noticed that the cafe has several non singaporean patrons. Great place to dine.

Probably rental cost in the area is high, the price of food is correspondingly higher too, didn’t help that the menu doesn’t show any food prices at all too, so it’s either you ask the price of each individual dish or you just go ahead and order without knowing the price. The food was average too, nothing too fantastic to warrant paying a premium for.However, the restaurant specialises in their chiffon cake, at $5 a slice, worth a try.Could try loo’s curry round the corner for much better value for money and tastier food. But be prepared for much longer queues

Recommended by a friend. Made so very welcome by the Cheng family who were so attentive. The Ginger chicken was incredibly tasty and the Gula Melaka Chiffon Cake was to die for. Loved the homemade Kaya so much that requested some to take home to Yorkshire. It was made fresh and packaged beautifully. Cannot recommend highly enough! Thankyou

Came here on a Friday night with a couple of friends to catch up.Food - Personally loved the food. If you're a fan of hawker food and specifically "zi char" if you're local, I think you would enjoy this place. Strongly recommend the following dishes: Trotters beehoon, crispy chicken and hainanese curry pork chop. :)Ambience - The ambience was pretty nice and quiet on a Fri night, pretty good location for a catch up. As a whole, would definitely come back!Tip: If you're driving, there are limited public lots in the area, but there are many lots in the streets nearby like Tiong Poh and Eng Watt

This eatery is now called Cheng's @ 27, but still serves the same great homestyle Hainanese food, and cakes and kuehs. Favorites are the Hainanese pork chops, prawn rolls and duck with salted mustard soup. Their pandan chiffon cakes with gula melaka and homemade kaya are simply to die for! They used to have chocolate eclairs and cream puffs but stopped selling them this year, to focus on their cakes and kuehs

My parents have lived in the Tiong Bahru neighborhood for 2 years (US expats), and the whole restaurant knows them by name - this is definitely a good place for repeated visits. The menu is large, the staff is patient and friends, the food is hot and delicious. This was the second time I'd personally visited, and I was disappointed they didn't have the lime juice drink available, it was that good. Luckily, the cripsy ginger chicken was just as amazing as ever, The would be a good place to have dinner if you're getting tired of the city bustle but still want some local-style cooking

It could be the rental that have the prices of home cooked food offered on a higher end. SGD50 for 2 persons for a Pig Trotters Mee Hoon (for 2 to share with 5 pieces of meat, little vegetables), a bowl of salted veg duck soup and 1 fried beans dish. Along with 2 glasses of drinks. For $25, one could get a decent set lunch at a fully air con pace. The mee hoon is moist and is of a good standard, but certainly not out of this world

On walking about in Singapore, we stumbled up this place, not the cheapest but certainly one of the best. Food was of a very high standard and when you are eating with all the local Chinese people, then you know you are on to a winner.Im not a huge fan for Chinese food but for this place Im a big fan, tucked away at the back of what looks like a Deco housing scheme you will find it, believe me its well worth the hunt, it will not disappoint

Although the glaring, fluorescent lighting destroys whatever potential ambience this place could have (the location is ideal & picturesque), and the prices should equate with a more gemutlich atmosphere (and this is one of the world's most-trendy neighborhoods, after all), I will continue to come back here for the crispy chicken, which is the best food of this type I've ever had, anywhere. It's all about the fresh ginger, extra-thin slices, and the freshest, leanest-but-tenderest meat imaginable

We've lived in Tiong Bahru for some time and only went to Cheng's for the first time a few weeks back. Three visits since, it's now our new favourite.Sure, it's a little more expensive than you would expect to pay for local food (around $60 for two with mains, rice, and drinks), but it fantastic. Clean flavours and swift/friendly service.The hours are specific (we were turned away at 915 on a Friday night as they stopped taking orders at 845!), so work around them.The ginger chicken will change your life and the local ambience and friendly family that runs the place all come together to make it an essential visit

Great restaurant if u wanna try the local Hainanese food. The duck soup and crispy pork with curry sauce are the best in my opinion.

Close by to where we are staying this is a favourite local restaurant with quick service and good cheap food.

Lunch with Son on a Sunday. Ordered the crispy pork curry, sliced fish with bitter gourd and lime juice. Food was really delicious although prices on the high side

Their best seller dish is simple: just crispy chicken with ginger and cucumber (have to order rice separately) but sooo good!
Nice and quiet area too, with open air seating.

Had the Curry Pork Chop for lunch. Pork chop was fragrant which is tender on the inside but crispy on the outside. The curry was good and not too spicy. Combined this with a glass of lime juice and you get a very satisfying meal.

A very friendly restaurant where Westerners like me are very welcome. Try the crispy chicken with ginger. Delicious!!!

Asked for some recommendations during dinner. So ordered the crispy chicken with sliced ginger, salted vegetable duck soup, prawn roll and French beans. The taste was OK but the bill came up to be around $50plus. I supposed prices weren't stated n I also assumed that the prices should be like any cze char stall. I was a little surprised. I won't come again. If u like some good hainanese cze char , I will recommend you Jin Wee restaurant near siglap centre.

This is run by the Cheng family - Mum and sis are super cooks; dad and brothers serve and manage. We are so fortunate that they've opened their "home" to us. We loved the pig trotters bee hoon, kampung chicken, steamed pork, crispy pork chop and salty duck soup. The omelette was so good, we ordered two servings!Must try the gula melaka chiffon cake and the biscotti. At $50 per bottle, this was very expensive but not when you consider that it is made with cashews and almonds. Absolutely delicious with a cup of latte!

Cheng's is the type of place you can easily call your favorite. In The Singapore restaurant world that is saying a lot! The ginger chicken, the pork chop, the mustard/duck soup are all simply outstanding. If the food isn't enough be sure to introduce yourself to Mr. Cheng and you will soon see that he loves his family, his customers and serving great food. There are cheaper places to eat at the market, and I enjoy them greatly, but when I want to feel like I am eating dinner with my family I always go to Cheng'

I came across an article on their cooking and decided to give it a try. Took their signature dish of Hainanese Pork Chop Rice with Curry. We shared and it was so good that i forgot to take a picture before eating. Curry is flavorful. Car parking can be tricky
