Finally got to try the famous j2 crispy curry puff listed on bib gourmand. One bite and you know the pastry is the star. It's crispy and flaky without being crumbly. Pity about the filling though. I had the curry chicken and potato. It was mostly potato with hardly any chicken. Would have been nice if they had a slice of hard boiled egg too. Would not mind paying more for heartier filling

The name of the stall is a bit odd but the products are anything but. Curry puff is a very popular local snack. Here at J2 you can enjoy a lovely version: crispy skin, smooth but not greasy, flavourful but not overpowering and best to consume soon off the hot oven
