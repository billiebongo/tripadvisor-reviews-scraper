Good food, a tee bit expensive (well, to be fair, there is no place in Singapore that is not expensive), fast service, nice live music, and near the quay. We were here during the after work scene, so there were mainly people drinking after work.

Friendly staff, there's available seats on a weekday night after 930pm and one of the rare places that are still open at this time AND serves hot food. Love their dim sum menu! Plenty of small bites (steamed and fried) to choose from, and there's also pizzas! Pizzas are quite small in size thoug

Was surprised that they serve decent lunch food here. Spied some dim sum sets, but we went ahead with the char Siew noodles - noodles were okay, werenâ€™t very springy, but the char Siew was pretty good. Was priced at $7.5 nett, a standard CBD price
