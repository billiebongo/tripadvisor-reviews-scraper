I really enjoy the food here and the service staff have been helpful in sharing their opinions when asked about the food. Can have a great family meal and an awesome time without the issue of worrying of being too loud or quiet.

nice restaurant, excellent service. food was good (really enjoyed triple corn soup, and rotisserie chicken. also offered great advice on wine pairing for my meal.
5
My family celebrated Father's Day here, and had an awesome experience. Food was excellent & service was really great! We'll definitely be back soon!
5
I always enjoy shelter in the woods. Good food and friendly staff. Very good variety of food n good for sharing too
5
the food was good. Lamb chops were very well done, succulent...:) The service staff was very attentive and polite. Overall, an excellent first visit.
2
The charcuterie board was great. However, anything we ordered that had to be made at the restaurant was lacking. For $20, you'd expect better bread than white sliced bread.
5
Exquisite roasts and pates! I would definitely come back, especially for celebrations with friends and loved ones.
5
The food was good, especially the steak tartare and suckling pig, the steak was also beautifully done. Its a beautiful and quiet place for a romantic dinner. Yums... I will come back for sure.
4
Went for dinner on a tues night. Not crowded. Service was friendly and food was not bad. Had a couple of beers and we enjoyed the dinner
4
Suckling pig dish was juicy and skin was crispy. But came in the form of a few bite size pieces. Better to order the larger size ($68) if there are more than 2 diners. Duck rillette was smooth and creamy. Mix meat platter is great for a small group. Steak was pretty decent, baby chicken and lamb were both tender and juicy. The only item that didn't match expectations was the steak tartare. Pretty presentation but meat lacked taste. Tasted like frozen beef.
4
Ordered iberico pork w bruschettas, grilled squid and lamb shank. The lamb shank was the best. Restaurant was not overly full, so could have a quiet dinner.
5
i always love visiting shelter in the wood for its homely dining environment and unpretentious quality food. The seafood casserole, main lobster pasta and pork pluma never disappoint!
5
The portions were HUGE! Very well worth the money spent! The food and service were both excellent! The appetizer cold cuts came with a wide variety and the main courses more than filled us up.
5
Excellent service. Our plates were changed often to ensure we have a clean table. The grill lamb and beef is one of the best around! Well done to perfect tenderness with the juice seales in.
5
Food was amazing! We had suckling pig, chicken & pork
Great presentation
Awesome ambience
Definitely superb service
4
The service is good and food is really nice especially the recommended salad meats platter. Truly awesome!
5
great catch up with friends over some wine and meat. french dining tucked in the quiet hillview estate. the restaurant doesnt have many seatings so do make reservation in advance to avoid disappointment. kitchen's managed by a japanese chef, we had some cold meat platter appetiser, roast chicken, and suckling pig (all of them are good, which id recommend you try). service is ok, not top notch, but decent. will be back!
5
We've travelled around in france alot and the food here is the only one good enough to rival the few big names in Paris. We've been back here again and again and always have met with consistent quality, good service and excellent food! what else could one ask for
5
We went there for a quiet Sunday lunch and it was great. The atmosphere is quiet and cozy, the service is great and the food is delicious.The iberico main was the highlight of the lunch, although the iberico bruschetta and the grilled kind prawns were also excellent. Will be going back
4
I am French so I am usually quite disappointed by French restaurants in Asia because they tend to forget the basics of French cuisine (I am talking about cuisine not "fine food" here) : good portion, good seasoning and fresh ingredients. Shelter in the woods respect these 3 basic conditions. You may enjoy a good dinner with decent wine in a nice place. Service is attentive and you won't have a heart attack when you will get the bill :
3
went there with high expectations for the food, due to highly raved bloggers' reviews. Was disappointed with the food. quiche was too gelat and seafood casserole was a tad too salty for our liking. However, service was great, servers are very attentive.
4
Had a quick dinner with 2 other friends; it was a toss up between the lamb rack and the steak, but I went with the steak, done medium, and it was delicious, although I have to say my friend, who ordered the same thing with the red wine sauce, & I both agreed that the red wine sauce was better than the mushroom sauce, which I ordered. My other friend ordered a the whole roast chicken with bacon; she was small and petite but she finished it up to the bones! Our starters were oysters, which were good and fresh, and the grilled squid which had the most wonderful sauce (can't remember what it was, but do give it a go!!)No dessert, as we had to leave (plus we were all very full!! .. but I will definitely go back for the Pineapple Crumble !! Surprisingly light and deliciious!!
4
We stayed nearby and found this restaurant to be the most appealing of the those in the restaurant quarter on Greenwood avenue.We sat outside on a pleasant night and had good service, food and wine. My wife was a bit disappointed that the baby chicken was sold out, but the half of the bigger chicken was grilled to perfection; chicken can as we all know easily be dry. My grilled whole snapper was also perfectly grilles and the vegies for both dishes tasted well. We did not have to pour the wine ourselves, which I of course do with pleasure, but is a sign of good service when you do not have to. The result was then, of course, 2 bottles of nice French wine.One may say that the tables outside were very close and gave little privacy. This ment, on the other hand, that we came to talking to our French neighbor table, ending up with the 4 of us sharing the best part of the second bottle.I am sure we will be back on our next visit to Singapore and Greenwood Avenu
4
It was a lovely experience there celebrating my Mum's birthday. Service was fantastic. Food was great except for the chicken which was a quite dry. The chicken was part of the meat platter we ordered. Loved the sole which was fresh. Beef lamb and knuckle was fantastic.
3
We went there on a Monday and it was quite filled by 8pm. Food is good. Bread excellent. Service is good. But the website says it's touted as potential Michelin star. Not quite the oomph of one star. Will we go back ? Yes. But currently Singapore is exploding with choices. Surprisingly there was ample parking although we were warned.
1
Food was bad. So called roasted suckling pig came in pieces, skin stuck to fat and rubbery. To make matters worse it smells like overnight meat. Was not even warm. Rack of lamb came warm. Looked like the meat was left in oven to keep slighty warm.Had a battle to cut it up. The sauce did not help.THE sole came in burnt at the edges, flow of butter. Obvious the fish was cooked in butter that burnt in the process.French bread stale.Be careful. We did not make a fuss although it was not cheap. First and last for me but others should be made aware. Never had such a bad experienc
3
We had quite a blast for my friend's birthday celebration at Shelter in the Woods . They manged to get a corner table for the birthday girl. They are supposed to be famous for their meats , but the best dish of the night was actually their lobster pasta . Enjoyed my meal ther
4
We we're celebrating a friend's birthday and as we were a group, it was a great way to sample the restaurant's offerings. Their specialties are rotisserie meat & fish dishes. We shared a charcuterie platter to begin, the pork rillettes & foie gras torchon were standouts. The three corn soup was tasty but the texture was a little too dense for my liking. Once the mains arrived, the meal really got started - suckling pig, lamb chops, steak, roast chicken - all roasted to perfection. The endive & blue cheese salad was also excellent and a perfect foil to the meat. Desserts are not their strong point but one memorable dish was the pineapple crumble, roasted pineapple & fresh basil flavours which made for a refreshing end.
4
really like this place. have eaten here once for brunch and twice for dinner. both times came away feeling like, damn, we need to do this more often. most recent visit included a fantastic squid/clams/chorizo starter and grilled lemon sole - one of the best pieces if fish i've ever tasted. decor is rustic but the kitchen's technique is refined. have not been blown away by the desserts, but highly recommend for anything else
5
Judging by the huge crowd in this restaurant, it must be a big hit with the patrons, I was absolutely dazzled by the fare at Shelter in the Woods, with modern European rich flavours with a delicate Japanese touch. The portions are not big and are just right, which is good. The service staff were exemplary, they were super polite and were well-trained. Will come again for sure
5
Was amazed by the fare at shelter in the woods. Modern european rich flavours yet with the delicate Japanese touch. Portions are not huge. In fact very good sized in our Asian context. The desserts are awesome.
4
Came here for a birthday dinner for a friend. Food was good and service exemplary. Will come again for sure
5
Attentive to detail on their meats and sides. Will always go back for more and the staff is overall well attentive and know the menu well and can give proper opinions on dishes.
4
We ordered the Escargot and Lyonnaise salad as Starters and it was terrific. The lamb and duck confit is nice too. Overall experience is great. All these dishes is good for 3-4 people sharing.
5
Cosy ambience, friendly and attentive service, great food – what's there not to like about this place?
5
Excellent french food by a Japanese Chef!
Traditional and great quality. Very good service. I can highly recommend it
4
Our first experience at this restaurant. Fellow diners who live nearby say this was their favourite restaurant in the neighbourhood.There are a number of meat dishes that will satisfy the meat lovers.We had a very nice tenderloin that was lean and meltingly soft with a great accompanying smoky sauce.As it was a wine dinner items that we wanted to try were not on the set menu for that night. So we will be back to try the suckling pig, aged wagyu and cured meat platter
3
Went there on a Saturday evening for dinner. We ordered 2 glasses of wine for drinks. For appetisers we got escargots and foie gras. Mains was a rack of lamb. Considering the price paid, the food was average. The rack of lamb could have been better, it was tough.
4
We had the first dinner here with an average feelingFood is good but pastry is missing some techniquesThe bread is really not good at all but their food is tastyService is good too but need to get more details Price for 2 adults and 1 baby 3 years was 295$ SGD I think for kind of bistro restaurant it is overrate
3
Portions are generally small. Last time I went the bread was nice and warm but this time it was at room temp... a small sign of inconsistency. Food was on the whole very tasty. We had the squid paella and suckling pig. The clam and chorizo pasta was ok but the smokiness of the sausage overpowered the clams which were succulent and fresh.
5
Great eggs Benedict and awesome desserts. Wonderful service and beautiful settings... will definitely come back for brunch!
5
Small little eatery in the Singapore suburbs. Service was impeccable. Probably one of the best I have experienced so far whilst living in Singapore.
4
First time and it was a good experience. Food served was awesome and I'll definitely be back again!!
4
Service is impeccable , although they forgot my coffee. Well it happens isn't It ?
Lamb rack could be better. Roast suckling pig and seafood casserole were great. Overall a good experience.
5
Although somewhat pricey, the quality of food, service and ambience made up for it. It is definitely memorable for me, and not because we spent too much.Worth the visit and even repeats as budget allows.Went on a Monday evening. We had the meat platter and chorizo squid
4
Nice atmosphere and ambience. Servers were very friendly and detailed in letting us know what the available food choices are. Food was ok, we really liked the chorizo squid (starter), the breads were very nice and red wine sauce for the steak was quite unique. The average steak (not the $158 one) was average
5
I enjoyed the cozy ambience. Each dish was a gastronomic delight, great presentation of food as well. Just a comment that a couple of dishes were just a tad salty but I tend to have less salt in my food so this is purely just my personal opinion. There was also a decent selection of desserts and we were all happy with our choices. Great choice of mascato that's being offered at the restaurant as well
4
We were four friends from different countries and it was our third time at Shelter. We again liked the home made pates with the quiche, delicious. The roasted lamb and ribeye steak were great, especially with the mushroom sauce.The service was smooth and friendly, we particularly appreciated that the staff took time to explain the food and the good recommendations of the sommelier for the wine bottles
2
We've been to Shelter in the Woods many times and have enjoyed the experience. The food is good, particularly the rotisserie items. They always have a few specials of the day that are worth trying. Evidently they've had turnover in staff and our experience suffered as a result. We were asked to place our rotisserie order in advance given the 30-40 minute wait time. Less than 10 minutes after placing the order the rack of lamb was presented, before we had even received our beverage order. Each appetizer was brought out separately, 5-10 minutes apart, by a different waiter each time. The second main dish was brought out before all of the appetizers. After the meal was over they finally realized that the third main dish hadn't been delivered. It went immediately into a box to be taken home. Unfortunately, no apologies were given and the staff, including management, appeared completely oblivious to the anarchy. It's too bad as they've done so much better in the past
4
2 of us shared a cheese platter, escargots, seafood casserole, whole rotisserie chicken and a bottle of wine.The cheese platter at $18 was good - came with additional sides such as grapes, dried apricots, jam and biscuit but too much for us to finish, would be good if the sizing was halved. Love the escargots-came nicely plated and baked with garlic and mashed potato, 6 pieces for $10 was reasonably priced. Next up was the seafood casserole (~$40) of 2 fish, clams, mussels, 2 scallops and 2 prawns, right portion to share with 1 for a main. The sauce was a tad salty otherwise the items were fresh. The last item was the whole chicken ($40) baked for 40 mins and came with roasted potatoes, garlic cloves, salad and curry sauce (optional as choice of sauce). They brought out the whole chicken and asked if we wanted it to be sliced and we readily agreed. It was nicely sliced into 4 parts-2 drumsticks and 2 thigh parts which made eating easier. It was tasty, well marinated, and tender. For a hearty meal for 2, would recommend the escargots, seafood casserole and whole rotisserie chicken.
3
Tried their seafood caserole and rack of lamb. Seafood was superb, lamb could be cooked a little longer to improve the texture, alittle raw in my opinion.
4
Shelter CHARCUTERIE BOARD steals the limelight from the mains courses. Suckling pig were well roasted with crispy skin.
4
The food was extremely delicious, and the service was one of the best I've experienced in Singapore so far!
4
I have been here twice and will come back again. Their starters are unique (think duck rillette, squid chorizo and escargot served on bone marrow) and so are their mains. My favourite was the ribeye steak as they do a pretty darn good medium rare. The duck confit however, I found a tad salty.As for the desserts, they were slightly disappointing. While the chestnut tiramisu sounded promising, I thought it was too sweet and lacking the espresso punch regular tiramisus have. The apple tart was also flat but the vanilla ice cream was good.Overall I would come back for the mains but not the desserts. (Oh and ask your friendly servers for wine recommendations. Ours was quite on point.
4
We had a great time and the restaurant is really delivering on the promise of a great French / European experience. Great vintage atmosphere. Restaurant a bit pricey, I guess 20-25% higher then expected. Also, didn't have some wines on the list that were advertised. Overall feeling, will go back. Plus: neighbourhood in Greenwood is just great and vibrant

Group of 16, went for dinner at a nearby restaurant and decided to have wine and desserts at Shelter in the woods. Arrived the place at 8.30pm, welcome by nice ambience, relaxed and cosy mood. As we were all taking our seat, the waitress came over to take our order and then we were being rudely informed that we should have mentioned them that we are not here for dinner, just wine and desserts; as they have prepared the meats in the oven! This is not a place that serves set dinner, so I am shocked that they cooked the meat even before we were all seated properly. Appalling! I can understand if the meat took longer to cook but it would be her good manners to inform us over the phone when we made the reservation if we like to order in advance. Like all good proper restaurants e.g. order a Peking duck when making reservation. Then we were being treated very badly after that, as she took our order and kept asking "is that it?" Mid-way, we decided that this is not something that we should put up with, and left the place. The waitress then told us to leave, and the other staff felt so embarassed and apologise to us. I am sure it was our bad luck being served by a poorly trained emotional staff, this happened on 13 Dec at 8.30pm
5
Very Nice staff and good wine!You will spend a great diner there, the staff is doing his best to offer a good experience!The meat (duck, lamb and pork) war tender and tasty I'm not a big fan of their foie gras but it is ok  
4
Very much recommended. Rotisserie suckling pig is a delight and went down a treat. One of the featured red wines was not available but was recommended a cheaper bottle which complimented the food wonderfully. We both had three courses which is a testament to how good we found our meal. Not entirely sure on some of the decor(!); but wouldn't hold this against the place. Overall a very tasty experience.

Hosted wine dinner from Château Pavie Macquin & Château Larcis Ducasse.Nicolas Thienpont’s father George, one of the ‘great Flemish tribe’ bought Chateau Puygueraud in 1946. His father, also called Georges, was a wine negociant following in a century old family tradition. This tradition continued with the purchase of Chateau Troplong Mondot in 1920 followed by Chateau Vieux Chateau in Pomerol in 1924. The latter remains in family hands to this day.Nicolas, fourth in a family of thirteen, did not seem destined for a career in viticulture. After studies in law and philosophy, and a small detour into teaching, he strayed into the metal industry (personnel management) in Provence.Disheartened by the paper-work, he returned in the early 1980s to the family farm where cereals, cattle, soya, plums and kiwis were the order of the day. In 1983, he undertook his first vinification at Chateau Puygueraud and from 1985 he assisted his cousin Alexandre in the management of Vieux Chateau Certan. At the end of 1994, the Corre-Macquin family asked him to take over from Maryse Barre at the helm of Grand Cru Classé, Chateau Pavie Macquin.In 2000, the Pradel de Lavaux and de Conink families, owners of Chateau Bellevue (also a Grand Cru Classé) took the decision to name Nicolas as director of the property.Finally, in 2002, Jacques-Olivier Gratiot, appointed Nicolas as manager of Larcis Ducasse, taking over at the head of this exceptional property.It is this chain of events that allows Nicolas Thienpont to “wander” with pleasure through the diverse expressions of quality that make up the wines of the Right Bank

My family of two adults and two children had a nice Sunday dinner roast here. I was pleasantly surprise how succulent ROTISSERIE "CÔTE DE BOEUF" was. It was a good size meat portion to share between four of us. Sides were delicious but the portions are quite small so you need to order a few. We were happy with mash potatoes and the green beans. The service was attentive. I felt a little rude asking to repeat everything twice to an Indian waiter. Great casual ambiance as well
5
My fave restaurant in Singapore. Best Spanish ever. Better than Catalunya n bam by far. Best Japanese chef. Terrific pates n razor clams
5
We celebrated my wife's birthday at Shelter. We have two young daughters, 5 and 7, and the staff treated them like princesses! Great food, wonderful service, nice ambience. Highly recommended.
4
Food was delicious, service excellent. I enjoyed this cute little restaurant. Nice ambience and very comfortable.
5
Had a totally captivating experience at the Shelter in the Woods. Friendly staff, coy ambience, wonderful food.
3
We like the restaurant. The food is good in a cozy + casual atmosphere...BUT not sure about service and they still charge us service fee?! We've tried lovely foie gras pate, which served different potion in each time.
5
Had a really tasty dinner for 2 persons3 starters - oysters, crabmead ravioli in lobster bisque, mediterranean style gambas in shells2 mains - rack of lamb, rotisserie chickendessert - pineapple crumble with granitasa very flavourful, hearty meal, the mains meats were cooked to perfectiongreat place to escape the crowds, service was attentive and polite (the resto was relatively empty)word of advice - just valet park, dont waste your time circling for a parking lot, before the valet left for home, he looked for me in the restaurant (he even remembered where i was dining) to hand me my carkey - SERVIC
5
Really can't believe I haven't heard of this place sooner! Our table was already prepared as we arrived - with child seat, plastic utensils and all. The service started and ended fantastic! If that wasn't enough...the food & wine selection were superb! Shared the escargot, charcuterie board, spare ribs and homemade sorbet. There is no doubt we will be back! Thank you to our wonderful and attentive waitstaff.
4
the duck confit and snapper was really good. Spinach salad was also great with the unique popcorn flavouring it had - never tasted salad to be so tasty ! Service was very friendly , although the food preparation time was about 20 minutes. Overall a great experience , and would definitely go back again !
4
We had 2 appetisers to share and 2 mains and a cote de boeuf. We were stuffed. Of course there were deserts and a bottle of wine as well.The Garlic gambas were fresh and garlic tasted was not to overwhelming. Wished they shelled the gambas though. Beef was tender and the red wine sauce complemented the flavour well. The bill came to about $530 with a $110 bottle of wine.
4
warm cosy feel and decent food.started with a great caesar salad, followed by the rack of lamb. A little under cooked for medium. And it would have been better if the fat was more charred. The duck confit was competent but not the best i had (the standard has been set very high in this country by some other establishment that sadly is no more)Dessert tarts were divine, I'd come back just for them
5
Very good coq au vin. Very tasty and light.
Superb dessert: meringue and rapsberry.
Nice service.
I warmly recommend this place!
5
Good food and great service.
Portions are very generous and the restaurant has a great atmosphere to enjoy dinner in.
Would definitely visit again.
4
Place is a it far from traditional city center, but I had a very nice dinner with a friend - dinner "al fresco" on the terrace.The food is just great - I had the lamb rack (rose of course)which was delicious and you must ask for the FANTASTIC puree.As a starter we had clam/squid/chorizo plate which results to be quite amazing.No desert 'cause we were so full already.Staff is extremely friendly
4
Been here a couple of times now, if you love pate's--and my family love pate's-- this is the place for you. They have a few different types and they are served on nice wood carving boards. I really like this restaurant, it is well run and they have some nice wines by the glass and bottle. Also try the clam and chorizo spaghetti........very good. Its easy to share at this restaurant, they have good sized menu and you end up trying a lot of different things. I enjoyed the atmosphere as well, you can sit up at the bar or reserve a table--the bar is great if you decide last minute to come.Overall, a very enjoyable evening and dinner wont break the bank. I thought value for money was decent
4
so this is a nice neighborhood restaurant with good service. Come here if you like meat - appetizers range from various types of pates and oysters to mains like sucking pig, rotisserie section with chicken, beef and pork. There are also seafood dishes like lobster pasta and seafood casserole - both of which were very nice. All in all we had a great time.
5
The service at Shelter was great! The staff there were attentive in attending to us and ensuring that we were comfortable, knew what was on today's menu and were prompt in responding to our requests. The food was absolutely delectable. We had the Chorizo Clam Spaghetti; Lamb Rack; Roasted Suckling Pork; and the Crème Brulee. The clams were really huge and fresh and the pasta was well salted. The lamb racks were to die for! Evenly distributed amounts of fat and meat, melts in your mouth and not hard to chew at all. The suckling pork had a nice crispy skin on the outside while the inside was smooth and tender.On the whole, I would say that this is a place worth trying out! :) Kudos to all at Shelter :)
3
We had a fantastic meal, and the raspberry tart was amazingly good. But as the restaurant needs the table back at 930pm for a 2nd seating, we were hurried through the main course and were asked repeatedly whether our plates could be cleared. Before i knew, i was given the menu to order dessert! 930pm came and the restaurant wasnt full, our table wasnt needed back! I hope the restaurant can plan better, though seatings and crowds are unpredictable, it can still be improved. At least we should not feel a need to gobble up and go
5
Went on Sunday for the Brunch menu.Amazing food for a pretty reasonable price. I ordered the Sunday Roast Beef, Suckling Pig, and Quiche. Would recommend all of them.Very cosy and relaxed setting.The staff were very attentive and we even received a complimentary dessert for Mother's Day. That was definitely the icing on the cake.
3
Had a chance to walk in early. The choice of food was great the overall choices of the food was good. The pork and pâté was great. Soups were done well. Sadly the steak was supposed to be medium rare but came out medium well. We did mention to the waiter to just let the chef know but I doubt that happened. The rest were attentive when we asked for water. However another waiter took forever or totally forgot when I asked for a hot sauce. Lastly, the cheque took forever to arrive and I had the cheque after another table had asked for it. Kinda spoilt the mood for us.
4
Having tried to get a table for some time was happy to be able to get a table for 4 on 6 hours notice. . Now i see why.The restaurant was half full or half empty depending on your views .. as its been packed before (allegedly) id chose the half empty.Good menu and fair wine list. Each priced arpund average. Menu varied and changing specials and the place has a goid ambience. Staff is friendly, helpful and attentive Food is served one by one so 4 people had starters served separate and the main courses likewise. . Shame. The food is average .. not michelin standards. Not fabulous. Not worthy of rushing back. . It eas average. The lamb was slightly undercooked and was excedingly fatty ... average. The oysters served in salt water and a sliver of lemon no attempt st vinegrette or such. Deserts were good .. coffee sublime.Worth a try ..yes. worthy of dome of the hype .. not now ... maybe needs to look at otself and bring back the standards if they were evident
4
Quality of the food was great. My partner and I were very satisfied with the meal and service. Will come again.
4
Lovely food in a cosy restaurant. We had the charcuterie board which was fantastic, followed by lamb which was cooked to perfection.
5
The restaurant feels like a cosy cottage with a friendly and laid-back atmosphere. We were greeted by the friendly staff who gave us several recommendations from the usual menu as well as the special menu of the day.EVERY single dish was delicious! We had the grilled razor clam that was done just nice with garlic and salt. They are truly finger licking good. Next we had the Shelter Charcuterie Board. The foie gras "au torchon" was so tender and tasty as well as the duck rillette. It was so fulfilling and my kids could not stop helping themselves to the fillings. The mains we had were the Seafood Casserole and the Rotisserie suckling pig. We polished the casserole so clean that they do not need to washout. They even gave us another serving of broth. *So embarrassing* of which we have no hesitation of finishing it. The suckling pig was of a generous serving with extra crispy skin and tender juicy meat. The pineapple complements the meat so well. In short, we cannot complement Chef Masashi Horiuchi enough for all the wonderful food that he has cooked with so much dedication and perfection
5
Cosy, bubbly and friendly place a bit out of the city buzz. Ideal for a quiet dinner. Great food choice, Japanese chef who worked some years in Paris with Michelin starred Robuchon. You can tell the by the French inspired menu.I recommend the foie gras to share as a starter and their famous rack of lamb. Their wine list is extensive and reasonably priced.We liked it very much
5
We had a very nice evening sitting at the bar. All fresh dishes were prepared in front of us. The charcuterie, steak hache and beef were very good and it was just as if we were in one of the best places in France. The staff is friendly and engaged with the guests and with each other. I look forward to come again
5
This place has been around for some time but I never went cuz I never read great things about it until recently. Chef Masashi Horiuchi from Joel Robuchon, London just took over as 'consultant' 4 months ago. Recommend the Charcuterie Platter, Steaks and Squid with Chorizo. Go quick before he leaves! Reservations essential - even on a weeknight it was fully booked!
3
Food was good but wished the popular seafood casserole which was meant to be shared was a bigger portion. I had confirmed reservations but arrived only to be seated at a table for 2 when our party was for 3 and had to squeeze while having our appetizer and at the same time waited for another table to be done so they could shift us over. Wasn't too happy abt this and to add, the place is really small and it was packed so it was rather noisy. But the restaurant mgr (I think that was who she was) was nice and kept updating us when we would be able to move to the bigger table and all the service staff there are also very friendly and readily available.
5
Lovely ambience, great food and good service. Consulting chef, Masashi Horiuchi adds a very personal touch to the service. Suckling pig melts in the mouth. Duck confit, a traditional french favourite, was also very tasty. Not so floored by the deconstructed pineapple crumble though. Will be back again soon.

Amid all the rave reviews, a booking was made for a birthday dinner. Staff called the day before to confirm and I reminded them it was a birthday dinner to which he muttered "YEAH YEAH YEAH" impatientry. I kid you not.Upon arrival, we were seated and ordered a bottle of red wine. Which took 20 minit's to arrive. The bottle was sitting on the counter and has condensation on it. It was chilled. Now, this is a french restaurant isn't it? Red wine chilled? Anyway, asked for the sommelier and they recommended wines by the glass. Just 3 options. Whatever. I've never had red wine served chilled in my life and certainly not in a ftench restaurant!!AND upon dessert, our neighbouring table got a happy birthday, we didn't get none. Despite me reminding the guy who called. Food wasn't too bad. Some hits and misses. The charcuterie board was nice- loved the rillette. The seafood casserole was a recommended dish. It came served in a huge cocotte, only to lift the lid to discover measly contents. Taste was ok, perhaps erring on the saltier side. Nothing to shout about.Their roast pig was good. Loved the grilled pineapples, we oordered a sharing portion which had 3 little slices of the pork. Perhaps we should be ordered the full portion.The roast chicken had the option of house curry sauce or gravy. We ordered it with curry sauce since it seemed to be their home made signature sauce. It was awful. The sauce had a mothbally taste. Just awful.The chicken alone was fine, a little salty but ok.Desserts were fine. We had the pineapple crumble which was the same grilled pineapple served with the pork, accompanied by crumble on the side. Also had the berry meringue dessert with raspberry sorbet and vanilla ice cream with berry compote on the side. I enjoyed thisWhen the waitress came to check on us, she asked us if the food was alright. My partner told her the chicken was salty to which she replied very patronisingly thay she would tell the chef. That's it. And did she go off to tell him? NOthere's more. Check came and my credit card got charged more. If I hadn't checked, I wouldn't have known.What a horrible birthday experience. I felt so horrible for my partner. Never dining here ever again and most certainly NOT RECOMMENDED!

Great rack of lamb, and the rotisserie chicken was delicious with crispy skin. The quiche was a standout for me - delicate mushrooms and caramelised onions that just melt in your mouth. They had quite a range of yummy looking pates too, so it's a good place to take that lonely homesick European in your life. That way, you can eat the excellent lamb and listen to them complain about how expensive the stuff is and how it's a tenth of that back home.

Great food, portions a bit small but oh so tasty
A bit pricey but to be expected around the Greenwood area
Lovely staff and great venue
Loved the look of all the Rums
Will definitely go back

Booked in as preferred destination was full. Great food and great ambience in this quaint little French eatery. Service by staff was exemplary by Singapore standards. The duck and liver parfait was fantastic and the beef cheek stunning. Highly recommended.

I booked Shelter in the Woods for my wife's birthday after reading a few online reviews which all seemed very favourable. Personally I am not a huge fan of French food which is overly fancy and delicate so it was nice to see that this restaurant focuses on simple and rustic dishes cooked very well.We started with the Pate board which was more than enough for two of us share. The restaurant has a great selection of pate which I believe at least some of which are made on the premises. For fans of pate this is a dish sure to please with plenty of bread slices and a couple of side condiments to pair with. For mains we chose the restaurant's signature dish of suckling pig and another dish of the roast lamb rack. Both meats were cooked superbly well with nice seasoning. My one criticism is that the portion size for the suckling pig was a little small with only three 'cubes' of pork spread out on a large plate with some very nice caramelized pineapple accompaniment. It would have been nice to have a couple more pieces of the melt in the mouth pork for the price of the dish.The ambience is pleasant with the feel of a rustic old Eurpoean house. The restaurant is very casual with all kinds of groups including children too so it may not suit those couples looking for a very quiet romantic evening. However for those looking for a non-stuffy, informal venue it works great. We will be back

We had a lovely meal, focusing on the restaurant's signature dishes - the pate board, suckling pig, seafood casserole and prime rib. The steak tartar was very well prepared. The kids went for pasta and fish 'n chips. Since they finished their meal, the taste must be good too. The staff were attentive. This restaurant serves food that is good value for money. A nice place for a family meal

Apparently this place has just undergone a renovation and we were some of their first customers on this night's "soft opening"... I can't praise it enough. We had no reservations but just walked right in... The decor is tasteful and wonderfully understated. Welcoming and unfussy. Lovely furnishings, comfortable chairs and a nice sturdy but unassuming green on the walls. Plenty of 'rustic' accoutrements (deer busts, antlers, etc.). Our friend had the lamb which he said was quite good, my husband had the pork and I chose the quiche and chicken broth with chicken wontons. Kids had braised pork belly and fish 'n chips. For dessert there was house-made ice cream (the chocolate was rather dark for the four year old, but the adults liked it just fine), apple tart and meringue glacee. Service was just fine. There was even an 'aperitif' course of rum and hibiscus granita to cleanse the palate between courses. I would have preferred a different flavor for the granita - but how refreshing to be served an aperitif to begin with!The atmosphere was intimate and it wasn't so loud you couldn't carry on a conversation. The staff was more than tolerant of the kids and very understanding. My most stringent criticism was that the fish from the kids menu was greasy. The prices were very reasonable. The most expensive thing on the menu was a cote de boeuf for $88 - but that's intended to serve 3 people! Our entrees were in the mid-twenties to mid-thirties. Especially for a sit-down dinner in Singapore, with Western-type food, this was more affordable than average. It was also the most reasonable place on that street...and the menu was the best suited to our purpose (our friend from the US had a hankering for meat). Portion sizes were quite adequate and presentation was superb. I was the only one to order a small entree and a soup but no one left hungry, nor would we have without dessert. We live a short and pleasant walk away at the Arcadia and I asked my husband if this was a good thing, or a bad thing, that we found a nice restaurant so close to home. He frowned that it must be bad (because he knows I'll ask to come back), but I am convinced it is our first bit of good luck in Asia! I'm actually a little torn writing this review. I don't want the place to go out of business, but I don't want to hassle with crowds either. Let's agree that you only come on nights when I'm somewhere else, OK? I'd really like to keep it my own little personal 'hole in the wall' with REALLY good food..

Dropped in for a quick set lunch on Saturday. Starter was a take on ham and eggs with some nice girolles mushrooms - tasty but what French restaurant would not serve bread, especially to mop up the egg! We ordered bread and of course got a big basket which was returned to the kitchen mostly intact - nice bread but we really only wanted a few pieces not a basket fit for a family, which of course would have jacked up the price of the lunch considerably and unnecessarily in my opinion. What was also poor was waiting over 5 minutes for the chef to cut the bread as he was understandably busy - not much consolation as our starters were now cold - why does the chef prepare the bread and not the waiters? Some attractive butter came with the bread but unfortunately we had no knives to spread it with! The main was smoked spring chicken and creamy purée which tasted lovely but a little more chicken would have been welcomed. Desert and coffee were nice.In summary, if this place wants to go the distance then the Singaporean chef needs to embrace more of the offering of a French bistro. They comped the bread in the end which was the right gesture and much appreciated

Shelter in the Woods is definitely one that needs to be persevered with. Firstly, the food is excellent with a very balanced menu. The wine list whilst not huge is again well balanced and the sommelier Vincent is very knowledgeable. It's certainly way above average for a 'neighbourhood restaurant' list.There are other interesting twists also such as the list of rums on the menu which was a very different offering and a very pleasant one. That's all the good stuff.The service wasn't 'bad' per se. The staff were supremely helpful, polite and chatty. The problem however is there are simply not enough of them. We had to go find our own menus, we waited 25 mins for bread to accompany our rillette starter and probably waited another 25 mins for our main course plates to be cleared.The place was entirely packed but that means that the restaurant can afford to hire more staff! We will certainly be back but the service needs attended to and quickly

We had read really good reviews on this restaurant, so ventured down. Really liked the location, and the restaurant ambience. The menu is not extensive, but we were going for the signature dish...suckling pig(35sgd) the mash an extra 10sgd.... I had gone expecting a suckling pig on the plate ( maybe I was naive) and was disappointed to get what looked like 4 chunks of pork with quail eggs and some leek BUT it was delicious melt in the mouth perfectly cooked. The mash was very creamy ... But still tasted good. My friends risotto was very small and left him hungry. The rest of us had the pork. Where they really hit you is the wine....Cheapest bottle 70sgd.... Then a leap into the 100's and upwards! If you are a wine buff...this is your place, but we just like a glass with dinner...don't go here if you are on a strict budget..or just avoid the wine and drink tap water( bottled water 8sgd). We can't fault the tasty food, just wished for bigger portion ..the taste deserves a 4 rating!

I've heard good things about this place and was looking forward to my Sunday Brunch that late morning...Everything looked good, but I didn't feel much in way of 'love' going into most of the dishes presented.. Only the tomato starter was indeed very good but everything else was, sad to say, very ho-hum and in fact both the suckling pig and beef had a stronger-than-comfortable gaminess to them...Maybe I'll try again, not for 'discounted brunch menu' but on full a la carte menu instead... Because I did hear good things about them...Service-levels were very high... That, was good..

When you want to get away from the buzz but still have some good vibe head down to Greenwood Avenue. We had a slow & wonderful weekday evening! The evening was cool so we decided to sit outside which was a great choice! The food is good here! The Sucking Pig & Tarte flambée was soooooooooo good! Gonna head down just for these two dishes. The wine list is pretty extensive and pretty good choices as well. Loved the service! We were attended to by this really nice local guy. He had good knowledge of food & wine served which is not common here. Only peeve was that kitchen was backed up that we waited a good 45mins between starters & mains. Other than that, it was a lovely evening and we would definitely come back for the Sucking Pig & Tarte flambée
