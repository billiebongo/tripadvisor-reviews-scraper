Quaint little sushi place where my wife and I celebrated our 7th year wedding anniversary. I think it's a great experience for anyone who have not tried omakase before.No deposit was requested from me. However, I can understand why they might want to do so as the seats were limited- cost of doing business will be high if clients dropped out

Depending on your budget for lunch, $38, $68 or $98, you get a different type of sashimi sushi. I tried both the $38 and $98 menu and I have to say that both the menu never left me (and my wife) wanting to come back for more! The fish slices that were served are so fresh. The chef even pays small details like putting a little fresh ginger onto the sushi to ensure you get a variety of taste when you pop the sushi into your mouth or even how he serve the sushi, i.e. from the lighting tasting ones first to the oily fish to a drier fish texture to ensure that we get to properly taste every single sushi that were served or not bringing too much rice into this mini pot to ensure the rice stays fresh. BTW, there only serve sashimi, so if you are not into raw stuff, then there is really nothing much for you.I saw reviews that chef has a different standard to different customer, i.e. friendly to regular while not so friendly to a 1st-time visitor, I would say that chef is more like an introvert person. When I was there for the 1st time, I felt that he did not chat much but he does join in the conversation when he has something to add and he may appear to make sarcastic remarks but maybe it maybe a "cold" joke for him (chill folks). For the second time, as he was more familiar with me, he did chat a bit more but still lesser than some Omakase chef I know. If you are looking for a fun-loving and chatty chef like at Teppei, then I think you will definitely not find it here. However, I don't really think this should bother anyone since we are really there for the food which I can see that he takes a lot of pride in making them and ensuring that they are the best to be served. The place is very neat and clean and the chef cleans the cutting board every single time after he made a sushi. On my second visit, they had 3 person around, so one was in charge of serving tea and starter while the other 2 chefs were serving customers filling their tummy! Service is honestly not too bad!As for reservation, I made for 3 person for the $38 menu, no issues too. For my second visit, I made for 2 person and 2 weeks in advance, so no issues too. For "hot" dates for V-Day or Mother's day, it is definitely wise to book in advance and expect that their basic menu will not be available. For the price, it is definitely worth the tasting experience and I will return to dine there again

You can a very reasonable sushi Omakase for $38 and better quality one at $98. Love the starting dish of onsen tomago (soft boiled egg) as it’s always just right. The sushi rice is nicely done with the right amount of vinegar. Overall the experience is good and truly worth it.

Offer a selection of Omakase menu. Usually go for the 15-course S$38 for lunch. Small place with total seating capacity of 9. Their communication can be rather confusing at times. Tired making reservation for dinner and was told 15-course only for no more than 3 pax. I had 4 than. The next time I tired to make dinner bookings for 3, was told 15-course only possible with no more than 2. So it was really frustrating. But the food is good and fresh though

Food was great. I went down to reserve cause I heard of their strange booking ways online. Wasn’t treated well and felt unwelcome. That’s fine if that is a unify equal treatment. What puzzles me is they were actually greeted selected or frequent customers with great smile. As first time customers we were ignore and stared at especially from the chef at the left of counter when I went to toilet, as if “why did you come to my restaurant”. Then the chef that served us was on the right of the counter, ignored us, while I was trying to chat casually. Then I asked “are you chef Roy?” He replied “I never heard of him” while that was listen on their website. But the best worst is, he chatted with joy with customer on our right. Cause one of the men been there before and he got extra portion on the truffle egg and special triple portion of the rice bowl. Food is great but it’s shadowed by their attitude of treating us as a 2nd class citizen and the unequaled treatment in your face. Nor I will go back or recommend my friends, there are plenty good places that welcome customers.

Tried making a reservation more than 1 month from the actual date, for 5 pax. Initial plan was to order the $38 set. However, was told that I have to go for the $98 set for group bigger than 3 pax. Asked if I can break up the group and make 2 reservations, was told that the group will not be seated together then. The staff Roy initially tried to "retain" me as a "valued" customer by saying he would allow me to get their $68 set for 5 pax and call back to confirm. After 2 weeks, i compromised by saying I would order the $68 set for 5 pax. He added a new rule requesting me to order sake if he were to allow me order $68 set, and to go down personally to make a deposit. I refused to budge as that was not our preferred dining choice. He asked me to reconsider and call back.If there is such a rule and min order of $68 or $98, it should be clearly stated in the website and not waste the customer's time to call in. Line was always not being picked up and reservation can only be made via phone. Pre dining experience was already very unpleasant. Totally unreasonable and unacceptable

Tried the $38 menu then the $68, then finally the $98 menu. Having been through all menus, I can say that no deposit was requested from me. Never have the staff been rude. Pix are for the $38 menu. There's only 1 waiter who doesn't hover around and only comes out during serving of items that are not over the counter. Nigiri sushi served is nice and fresh. Chefs do not talk much, compared to other places in Singapore. As I'm a small eater, I requested for less rice with my sushi. As they are a low frills omakase place with good quality, they expect people who are coming to read the menu carefully before making a reservation. My husband does not eat chutoro or ootoro, he didn't know the $68 set consists of those. On the day itself, he tried to change it but they did not allow him to do so because they already set aside a fixed amount of meals to be prepared. The difference between the $38, $68 and $$98 set is probably the quality of fish used. For the $68, they have chutoro, ootoro and 1 or 2 others more than the $38 set. for the $98 set, needless to say they have uni, and instead of a chirashi bowl, Roy coats each grain of rice in uni, before adding more uni and tobikko into it. Where else can you get this kind of value for money in Singapore?Lesser service, good quality of sushi (I didn't say outstanding but good enough for a quick fix), good price point. Make your reservations early, it's a 9 seater so it gets filled up easily

For this reason, I am not going to bore you with reviews of each individual item- since you don't get to choose anyway, & you're at the mercy of the chef in front of you.But I will say this: The food was delicious. It was fun to watch Chef Lewis prepare each item carefully & lovingly in front of me. I wish that more explanation was given to each item (because I always love hearing about my food), but I am sure Chef would be happy to answer whatever questions you have, as he did mine.There aren't any entertaining theatrics involved, just a simple, unassumingly quiet atmosphere for you & your partner to bask in & chit chat. In fact, the other 6 diners next to me were all SO quiet that I felt like I was being too noisy (I wasn't ok) (lol) talking to my partner throughout the whole dinner. The lady next to me was playing a game on her cellphone, completely ignoring the person she was dining with. A GAME. This is something I would never understand.Overall, an enjoyable experience! I am sure you want in, too, so here's a word of advice: Ryo Sushi only seats 8 pax at a time, with 3 dining time slots per evening- 6:00PM, 7:30PM, 9:00PM, so it would be very wise to call in advance & make a booking. Accepts credit cards  Air-conditioned seats only  No WiFi available  No service charge or GS

I tried to make a reservation with Ryo Sushi and I got the most ridiculous requirements ever. I first tried to call them over the week, and they never pick up my calls. Gave them the benefit of doubt as they may be busy.A couple of days later when my call finally went through and I told him my preferred sitting and date, the first thing he says is that I have to deposit a minimum of 50% of my total bill and that the minimum order of the $68 set (fatty tuna). This is understandable because they have had bad experiences with customers who cancelled their reservations at the last minute. He then asked me to call back a few hours later to confirm.When I did call back a couple of hours later, he then told me that half of my order has to be the $68 set (fatty tuna), while the other half must be the $98 set (sea urchin). This is practically forcing me to buy their product??? What can I do if all of us want to eat the fatty tuna? What if all of us are allergic to sea urchin? What made this change of requirements for reservation in the first place? Why did he not tell me when I first called - it's not like it's the first time people made a reservation for more than 3 people right?I believe that there is a limit for an establishment to reduce their no-show risks. I am fine paying the deposit, and even limiting my order to a more expensive range. But forcing the menu down people's throats is the last straw.Please educate me if this is the norm for omakase-styled restaurants. Either way, needless to say, they have lost good business and their reputation here

Omakase is my all time favourite and has been to several. I tried the uni omakase ($98) while my friend took the $68. Both were very good. Nothing fancy, no fuss, simple yet wonderfully fresh. Similar concept like Sushi Dai at Tokyo. Unless you are an uni fan, the $68 will suffice. I highly recommend this place to anyone. Will definitely return. Do make reservation in advance. They are usually fully booked
