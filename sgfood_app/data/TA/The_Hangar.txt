Came here with a friend to enjoy some coffee at its outdoor seating. With good weather, its pleasant enough to have a chat. Coffee portions are quite small, but very flavourful. Service was kind of meh, but its still worth the visit if you're around.
5
We have been here for a late breakfast - great food and delicious coffee. Very friendly service
We got Even a dragon fruit for free! We totally recommend this place!

The hangar is in q great neighborhood in Singapore, has good breaky. A bit pricy though...
Service is good, they have tables outside.
5
With a catchy name out the front "Coffee, sandwiches salads and s...t like that" this is not your usual cafe in Arab Street. The coffee is outstanding and the breakfast menu was brilliant. Whilst it was a bit pricey the service was good and we even had our coffees refunded when one of the meals rocked up late. Id recommend this place for anyone that wants a good Australian type coffee and a good quality cooked western style breakfast...

The Steak Burrito Bowl ($18++) reminds me of Chipotle on a good day, but even better. Not only does the generous bed of cauliflower rice make me feel healthy, but the other ingredients are also bountiful & delicious. The flank steak slices were tender & juicy, & the roasted veggies - mushroom, cherry tomatoes & guac, have very harmonious flavours. Nothing was fighting over each other for attention. I LOVED THIS. I walked out of the Hangar feeling super duper happy & also quite full.The Steak & Chips ($20++) tasted better than it looked. Was worried this medium-rare flank was overcooked, judging from the outside. But after I cut into it & started chomping, my eyes lit up. The chips & salad were unfortunately nothing special; I'd rather the Steak Burrito Bowl over this, but that's just my personal preference. The latter is definitely more filling & value for money.Washed my meal down with a nice glass of Amber Ale. What they had on tap differed from what was on the menu, which was fairly odd. Our server also didn't seem to be able to tell us (or just couldn't be bothered to check?) the brands of beer that were available - only the types of beer. This was the only downside of my visit, but I'll be back - hopefully I'll know what I'm drinking the next time.  Accepts credit cards Air-conditioned seats available☀️ Al fresco seats availabl

Well we ventured into this cafe, expecting that it has to be Australian given the logo out the front of the cafe. "Coffee sandwiches salads and s... like that" !!Service was good but pricing opportunistic. Given that the day before we sat perched 57 stories high in the Marina Bay Sands luxury hotel bar, with a beer costing us $16, paying this price in a cafe on Arab street was considered quite rude. Juice, served in a small glass loaded with ice at $7 equally as rude but more dispaointing given the lack of quality and value. Don't get me wrong I don't mind paying the price providing what I buy is value or outstanding. Didn't bother with the food, not worth the price. Sorry but missed the mark for us. Give this place a miss and head to one of the many restaurants in Arab street which are keen to serve good food and drink at fair pricing
5
Pav is the man! Super chill cafe and bar right at the end of Arab st. Music, food, staff, vibes.. I can't say enough about this place. If you're in Singapore even for a short stay this is a must. I promise you won't regret it! Long live sexy coffee
5
Just had a great breakfast here at the Hangar. Relaxed, prompt and very friendly service. Food was amazing. I will definitely come back here again and strongly advice people to stop by.The atmosphere is chill and relaxed. No fuzz! Nice table setting outside where you can enjoy the view with a superb cup of coffee.
4
Been at the Hangar for lunch. The menu is on the healthy side, and all items look very tempting. I tried the salmon and quinoa bowl and it was great. Coffee is also quite ok, though the portion was a bit small.The waiting time was, unfortunately, a bit long. It took 30 minutes to get my order. Since it's lunch break and people don't that much time, I think it'd be good to try serve a bit faster. The place is not big so it gets packed during peak hours. It seems like they accept reservations though
4
Small place with fun low-key atmosphere and good food & coffee. I felt like portions were a bit small considering the price, but I didn't leave hungry. Our cappuccino and chai lattes were delicious. Recommended place! Also nice that it opens early enough for breakfast since so many places were still closed
4
Came haji lane for photoshooting sesions amd walked past this hidden gem and decided to give it a try. Very satisfied with their services and foods. Definitely coming back!
5
Had an amazing food in here,
Very good service as well! High recommend!!
French toast- soooo good ! Yam!
4
Definitely a place not to be missed; a hole-in-the-wall restaurant that boasts great service and ambience. Unfortunately, food needs to be improved!
3
I have been to Australia but yet to visit a cafe there. Upon inside the place, it brings back those memories that i had there.
Food was great and so was the water.
1
We did not have brunch there as first of all they did not prepare a table for us and secondly they did not have high chairs for kids.
5
Great little place on Arab St. Best Cappuccino I have had in ages, and the smoked Salmon and poached eggs is outstanding. Can't wait to go back. Only a 5 minute walk from the Park Royal Hotel.
4
Cool little indie coffee shop in Arab Quarter. Used to enjoy popping in here at lunch for a steak sandwich with chips and a flat white. Always found it to be top notch with a friendly crew.
3
somewhere nice to escape from the heat. didn't try the food but the coffee isn't too bad. very friendly staff
3
mediocre food; great place to hang out and chill though. average service but really value for money!!
5
Was recommended The Hangar by someone living in Singapore if we wanted decent coffee and they were not wrong. This cafe is run by an Australian and we know how fussy we are about our coffee! It is a really cute place and has wine and food as well and if you are looking for your avo smash you will find it here. Yes the coffee is not cheap, but then coffee in Singapore is not cheap anywhere. If you are visiting Arab street then do stop here as you won't regret it. Really enjoyed our visit to The Hangar
4
Stumbled on this great little place on Arab Street. Friendly Aussie service. Try thier home made sodas and pulled pork sandwich. Delicious.
5
Good quality food at a very reasonable cost. Must try the $2 oysters night and the killer cocktails.
5
Sandwiches were awesome, interior was really nice as well and the staff was super nice! I can only recommend this place!
5
Locally brew craft beer they serve here is amazing. They use German and Aussie Malta and hops and it really does the trick. Great atmosphere and friendly staff.
4
You have to love these folks. They take laid back to horizontal and still manage to come up with consistently outstanding coffee (over many many visits). The food however is hit and miss and the service can often be a miss. But if you want to step into an alternative era (imagine Haight Ashbury in the 60s) and don't mind the craziness of misplaced and misunderstood orders, a kitchen in a different time zone, and bush philosophers behind the bar ... and trade that for great coffee, then it's worth the experience.Given 4 stars because worth going for the coffee (get a take away) but know what you are letting yourself in for ... and then enjoy it rather than resist it
4
Had the salmon quinoa salad, it was decent not fantasic, the dressing was a little sweet. My partner enjoyed his chicken schnitzel sandwich. We went for the black mountain coffee but unfortunately wasnt available the day we visited. The iced latte with the alternative brew was still good! Great friendly staff!
1
Ordered a soy chai latte and got a normal one....than corrected the mistake but no apologies at all. Then the poached eggs on fresh sourdough bread and avocado.disaster.there was just one tiny egg(and not even poached decently) on old cold bread. Super overpriced even for singapore. The waiter told us it was his first day...but it was totally unprofessional, seems it never read the menu before or never actually worked in a restaurant. The guy that came out from the kitchen (the cook?) was such a dodgy person and he wasn t properly dress to work in a kitchen that ask 13$ for a sandwich. Asked the bill and complained to the guy who makes coffee (owner?) And the only answer was that they will do their best to improve in the future. But the only thing that had left to us was a big regret of entering in that cafe. Never again
1
We ordered avocado on toast with mushroom and I couldn't believe we were charged $12 each for 1 piece which didn't have that much topping on it. I understand Singapore can be expensive but it doesn't cost a business much to do 2 pieces of toast or make sure there is plenty of toppings. The vibe of the place is pretty cool and they did a nice chai latte. I wouldn't return though

A colleague and I decided to lunch in this place as we were looking for some healthy options. The salad menu looked nice so we decided to give it a try. It was not difficult to find a table as the place was not full. We ordered two set meals (meal+a coffee at your choice). The waitress was polite but had to ask twice what we ordered. Surprising for a simple order of two lunch set meals. And then the coffee was served after 10 minutes. Save that the meal was not consumed yet. That was a minor problem as it is common for locals to drink coffee with their main course. The problem was that we waited almost 45 minutes to get our sandwiches and when those were served, it was the wrong order (choice of bread). So back to the kitchen and finally after 10 minutes, the "mini" sandwiches arrived. No chips or fries and pretty lean for a 10 USD bread. What I really did not like is the waiter telling us "congratulations you finally got your meal". That was unprofessional and impolite and showing he really did not care about the wait. As office workers, we unfortunately don't have the luxury to lunch during 3 hours! On top of that, they charged an undisclosed 1 dollar for the double espresso I ordered with my set meal (double shot). We were expecting the restaurant manager to at least waive the 10% service charge but nothing of that nature was done. They just told us that it was because they just reopened after NYE and that it's usually like that during lunch time. I am not sure about dinner time but I strongly discourage any busy business men to visit this place. It's overpriced, service is unprofessional and food average
3
Arrived here after 9am with customers already sitting outside with coffee on their table, we went in to ask for a table but were told it was not open yet despite the opening hours being 9am so we were told 15 mins so we decided to wait. We then ordered coffee and breakfast both of which took a long time to arrive despite there only being 3 tables occupied. The coffee was quite good but the food was pretty bland and average and shouldn't have take as long as it did to produce
5
Great Coffee, great juices, great food. Modern and very friendly. Went several times during our stay.
3
The Hangar is a cosy place, with an interesting menu different from other cafes. The waiters were patient in explaining their items on the menu and I felt that their service was warm and good. Food was interesting, but taste was on the average.
4
Though small, nice place to hang out w friends, decent music. Delicious picolo (expresso/latte drink). My girlfriend ordered avocado expresso, also delicious. Was going to give 3 stars due to higher price, but changed to 4 for the quality and the hang out 'atmosphere'.
5
Different and quirky, this Aussie coffee bar is great fun, and the bonus is wonderful coffee.
Oh, and the loo is a must visit....
5
Brazilian pulled beef rice bowl was delicious! The beef was tender and flavorful. Staff was also very friendly and helpful :)
4
A cosy Australian vibes cafe with yummy sandwiches and delish mocha.We were a bigger group of 5 and the space is a bit too cosy for us. But I'd say this is an awesome place to hangout for 2-3 people.
3
We got off to a great start with friendly waiters on arrival, quick drinks service, great tasting coffee and a cute interior. However the brunch food we ordered took a long time to arrive. We ordered 4 dishes and the first meal came out a good 20 minutes before any other meal which is not acceptable when you're trying to all eat at the same time
5
I deliberately sought out a cafe that had flat whites (coffee) on their menu. We weren't disappointed. We walked about a 1 km from hotel to Arab St - very hot and humid. And so when we arrived we both had a yummy mango smoothie, followed by an excellent flat white (made with fresh milk, not UHT). Excellent location to have a look at this area of Singapore and great atmosphere
5
We had a quick bite at lunchtime at the Hangar and wasn't disappointed. I'd go back just for the coffee. Yes, it was expensive BUT just what I needed. The food was also good, but guys, get the timing right so everyone is served together! In fact, the food was very good. The area and atmosphere is great and the service friendly and engaging. Thanks for my coffee fix! And good luck with your coffee roastery, although if my coffee was anything to go by, you have it nailed!
3
It is a shame as the coffee and the food is good and nice environment but the service is very bad... the staff should be nicer (smile more) and proactive - it seems they are annoyed every time you ask for anything and they are rude sometime..they don't understand the basic of customer service.... as I said it is a really shame as the owner is trying hard..
5
Great little coffee shop / wine bar in Arab lane. The coffee is awesome, the owner, a laid back Aussie dude remembered us and our order. Highly recommended for all coffee addicts 😘
4
The food was fabulous and the owner very engaging. But they were severely short staffed, and I had to repeatedly ask for my orders.
5
A friend recommended the Hanger for lunch on my way through Singapore. There's an coffee machine with barista stationed near the front door and the smell of dank coffee beans hits your nose as you enter. I ordered food, with great service from the nice waitress; the Cuban chicken sandwich and then a martini glass of potent homemade ginger ale. I walked out, floating down the street with a good taste in my mouth from the arabica double espresso shots
3
This is a great place to spend some alone time, whether it's catching up on some reading or doing some work. The cafe is a small space with both indoor and outdoor seating, and it has a really chill vibe. Staff are super friendly and don't mind you spending ages with a drink. The place has both lunch and dinner menus. I tried to order the Spanish Chicken off the dinner menu, but I think there was some miscommunication and I ended up with the Mexican Chicken Salad. Not a big deal so I just accepted it. The chicken was cooked well, but there were really only 4 elements to the dish: the chicken, roasted peppers, guacamole and the salad. I wouldn't have minded paying a little more (the salad was $14.90) for a more interesting and filling salad. My friend got the lemongrass steak sandwich on ciabatta with a side of chips. The sandwich was okay (although I think the bread-to-meat ratio was unbalanced - too much bread). Also, the side of chips looked underwhelming.Definitely could improve the food and communication, but a really comfortable vibe.
4
We were looking for an easy lunch place with some atmosphere and this place has it all. Excellent vibe when you enter, attentive team looking after you, not too pushy to take your order but there when you need them. And the food was fantastic, Between four of us we had the lamb, french toast, cous cous salad and one of the hot meals. Loved it so much we then stayed for coffees which were also fabulous. Only downside was the size of our first table - but we managed to move to the round one
4
We ordered Norwegian's Catch, Lemongrass steak sandwich, Iced Cappucino and Long black. Lemongrass steak is suppose to be their signature dish. But we find the Norwegian (salmon) is better. The steak is too tough and there wasn't any lemongrass taste or smell...rather disappointed. The lady who served us was very sweet and friendly (there is only 1 lady running around tables, other guys are either cooking or making coffee). Overall, good experience...will come back for the coffee but will try other food
2
Ordered the lamb, arrived with coleslaw instead of the states cauliflower mash and gravy. Correct sides arrived a fair bit of time later by which point the lamb was cold, and it was then that is discovered it was undercooked in places (perfectly done on some of the pieces). Server was extremely polite and friendly and I would try again as I feel like it is a good place that had just had an off order, which I appreciate does happen, but needless to say I was disappointed.
5
we found this little gem early in the morning (9ish) strolling around Arab Street where most of the shops are still closed. went in with least expectation but they served very good coffee (Barista was from Melbourne) and we love the egg and Bacon breakfast roll.worth the money and just grab a cup of coffee if you are not hungry. you will not be disappointed
5
The Hangar & The Broth House (next door) are owned by the same chap so you can sit in either and order from both menus! (The Broth House is bigger so better for groups). Food is delicious - our group had Lemongrass Steak Sandwich, Smashed Avocado & Feta on toast, French Toast with fruit & syrup, Beef Vietnamese Pho amongst other and all were deemed to be delicious! Prices are good, staff are very friendly and attentive. Lovely tucked away little spot in the heart of Kampong Glam
5
Coffee is awesome and so was my ham, cheese and tomato toastie with the most delectable ham which the menu boasts about. My daughter's French toast was also to die for so we were very happy. Very friendly and welcoming owners and staff members. Industrial decor but good vibe all round. Can't wait to take my partner
5
Great ambience. Great food. Great service. Although main course was extremely limited. Most of the menu consists of side dishes.
5
Great service, great food and AMAZING coffee :)
Went for a quick brunch before having to pack up and head to airport and this place was great! Cute little spot!
4
Stumbled across this place when looking for somewhere for breakfast.
Good options for food and reasonably priced.
5
We didn't know it when we walked in, but it's owned by an Australian (and we are Australian so maybe we are biased) but great food, awesome coffee (the best) and fun service.
5
Newly found and great place for friends hangout and tasty food! Mexican chicken salad made by tender chicken trunks, creamy avocado and greens, the beef sizzling with lemongrass(Thai style), and tacos with special sauces and stuffings, especially the tofu one, superb. And there is no GST, only spent $47 for 3 persons! Will definitely come back again!
4
Feel like having afternoon coffee with a twist? You found the place! They do great expresso martinis. Beans are from El Salvadore - excellent for black coffee or try Black Mountain. Feeling hungry? Try a bowl of kolo Mee or pasta. Come back in the evening when the bar is open and swinging. Relaxed place to chill!
5
Great place for students, one sandwich with fries and a coke will cost you SGD 17 service included. Chose the chicken avocado sandwich or the salmons teriyaki which are both excellent. The staff is friendly, and proposes free water. Nonetheless the place is not very comfortable
4
Came in like 11.30 looking for breakfast but they only do it until 11. Nevertheless, they offered us the breakfast still which was super nice :) had the French toast which was really what I needed (sweet and tasty :D ) and the coffee was good too!Cool looking place too
4
We took two friends to this restaurant on a Friday night. The food was fantastic, but the waiters seemed more interested in their ipads than in serving us! We had to get up and get our own beers from the bar. However, the food was fantastic and excellent value - would come here again
4
A regular brunch location this place never disappoints. While I've only ever had breakfast here, the menu includes lunch and dinner options. Licensed with a good bar selection, and awesome music, The Hanger is what you would expect to find down an alley in Melbourne. The staff are friendly and the service is good. Meal sizes are just right and pricing is on par with Singapore standards.The cafe itself is small, as are the tables so sometimes expect a wait, but it's well worth it. I recommend the "End of the Rainbow" yogurt pot for sure.
5
Great coffee, cool and cosy set up
Didn't try their food but the selection looked good. Definitely will be back for coffee. Free wifi.
5
Stumbled across this cafe and we were so happy we found it. Had a coffee just like we get at home, and smashed avocado and fetta again just what we love. Fantastic to see some serious foodie thing going on here.
4
Went for late lunch. Friendly staff. Nice cup of coffee, a little bit strong for me. Average food. Reasonable price.
5
Really good coffee! The lunch special which includes a sandwich and chips with a coffee is great. Found in one of my favourite neighbourhoods, kampong glam.
4
I saw that they had a nice beer selection , even Peters cream stout and we went in. It's a tiny little cafe with a warm atmosphere. Both bartenders were very friendly. The coffee drinks they were making looked so beautiful I wish I had them as well.

BOTTOM LINE: This place was designed sincerely, and has some winning aspects, but in the end you can do much better in this neighborhood. Won't be going back, for dinner at least.GOOD:* Coffee is apparently legendary* Cool vibes and kind staff, live music from time to time. They folks there are kind and welcoming.* Food - Fish tacos are fantastic. The brownies and cakes are tasty. My wife tells me their breakfast stuff and lunch salads are better. Maybe dinner is just a bad time to go.BAD:* Incompetence - Was there on a Friday night, so peak hours, but as I stood in line several people came up to the cashier angry about something. Their drinks hadn't been brought, the wrong food was delivered to their table, the price on their bill was incorrect... My wife and I ordered some tacos and dessert, and they served the dessert first. I get it. These guys had a lot to handle, but it's their job to handle it and they didn't* Food - While there are a few highlights (above), it was generally a disappointing experience with lousy value.* Drinks - If you're not here to get amped or drunk, there is literally nothing for you. No juice, no soda, no nothing. Just tap water
5
Was recommended to try this place by a friend who now lives in Singapore. Probably not the type of place we would have gone without the recommendation but we really enjoyed it! The breakfast was really good and the place seem to be well patronised by locals and expats alike
1
Went together with my friend.The place was empty.Having 3 staff.and 1 cook i think.i ordered the hangover it consist of sausage,2 eggs,sauteed mushroom,sauteed tomato,bacon,hashbrown,home baked sour dough,and spicy baked beans.My friend ordered,end of the rainbow which basically a greek yougurt with,granola and berries!For drinks i ordered cappucino and my friend ordered iced latte.To be honest none of the food or drinks we like,the hangover plate was totally dried and very oily and i can say its not hot.The only thing that is hot is the sausage that came late we dont know if they forget or what.The spicy baked beans that very sour and theres no heat at all.I asked the staff if really meant to be that sour and can answered me yes,but in menu claiming its spicy!!My cup of cappucino that have chip.3 staff inside everyone was plying with their phone.The best thing happened when my friend ask for 1 piece of friend for the hangover that i cant finished!And ended they charged us additional sgd 3!! Without saying anything!We paid sgd 59 in total for this experienced.Not worth it at all.once again the place was empty!only me and my friend.There is no service here.We went here from a good review in tripadvisor.And a friend recommendation.Not again.Theres alot of cafe growing everywhere if this kind of service will continue,better think again.Maybe you guys want to do training again.The server that seems not fully knowledgable,2 other staff plying phone in the corner.Better go to forty hands or artichoke

Came here for brunch on the weekend and opted for "The Hangover" breakfast as I was feeling quite hungry. This consisted of some fried eggs, a sausage, some bacon (not crispy), a chick-pea dish, some hash-browns, and one of the tiniest pieces of bread I've ever seen. I asked for more bread and got an additional slice (for which there was an additional $5 charge). Coffees were decent but came at extra cost. Overall the bill was $60 for 2 (which was a little expensive considering my friend's choice was one of the cheaper offerings). On the plus side, service was friendly and efficient
3
Friendly service, good coffee but breakfast was $8.90sgd for a thin piece of sourdough toast with feta and avocado. Tasted good but was not enough for the cost and left feeling hungry. Better if they gave you two slices or one thicker slice. That being said, I still like the place but was disappointed in the food.
4
It's small with friendly staff with great coffee (I drink soy) and awesome brownies. Nice bread. Just off haji lane, easy to find.
4
You can enjoy Good atmosphere and rich aroma of coffee
Food is also good, but take time a bit because only one cook makes dishes for us
I recommend to have enough time
5
Stopped in with family and was overjoyed at quality of coffee and the awesome staff. A hidden gem well worth checking out. Sandwiches were great and smoothies divine
4
Excellent coffee, great friendly staff and good food. I had the kurobuta sandwich which was nice with good flavors. Only slight drawback is that the staff is not proactive in offering items once you finish them. I'll definitely be back again.
4
Got to love a joint run by someone who knows what he's doing because he loves what he's doing.Expect quality food & drinks & for many - the dope of coffee. Even the music sounds good here!! Appreciate a fitting of good sound system. Makes me stay longer than I should.Always love how I am greeted by a beautiful latte art in my cup. Sexy coffee indeed!! Come for a good time & more!! & for travellers who are early birds, they open earlier than most cafes. So come for your morning fix that your hostel might not provide.Have fun!
5
We can stay and eat in a hotel anywhere in the world and you might as well be in an airport transit lounge. The appeal must be to a wide customer base and we certainly cannot fault where we are currently staying, The Park Royal on Beach Road. But to truly appreciate a country you have to eat out. We were looking for a breakfast in the Arab Quarter and found the Hanger quite by chance. We have had breakfast there now twice and will do so again before we leave Singapore. Pavski and his team are so friendly and welcoming and the food is COOKED TO ORDER. So don't come for some express kept hot under a light fast food, enjoy a vanilla latter whilst you wait for your hand and home made delicious waffles topped with fresh fruit and dripping in maple syrup. Or salivate over The Hangover, not too much, just enough but filling to set you up till the next chicken rice, popiah or whatever
5
Stayed near kampong glam and was looking for a light bite a coffee around lunc time and found this super small cafe on Arab Street. Positively surprised by the unique and tasty coffee and the sandwich was really good too. Recomend for coffee lovers who are not looking for the normal big chain coffee
4
I needed a breakfast place in the Kampong Glam area at 11am and The Hangar delivered! Great coffee, a small but delicious breakfast selection and friendly staff. Only drawback is that this place is tiny - it is a cafe after all - so tables for more than 4 have to sit outdoors
5
Was supposed to eat Sunday lunch at another venue on Arab Street which turned out to be closed thus "fell in to the lap" of The Hangar. The place was jammed packed - inside and out - and no wonder. All day breakfasts plus lunch menue - super food with lots of smoked salmon with a variety of condiments - great Mexican salad with fresh chicken and guacamole - and not to forget the home made sourdough bread. Coffee beans from El Salvador - and they really know how to make use of the beans and their alternative coffees plus the normal ones are exceptionally good. Great imported beers too and finally I found a place which served Hawthorn Pale Ale! Homemade carrot cake, chocolate fudge cake - YUM!People working there are very efficient, friendly and professional in all they do.This place has been in operation for about 8 months - and appears to be an instant success - a bit alternative - but truly a great place to frequent. Opening hours between 9-7 on weekdays and 9-6 on the weekend. I bet you they will soon extend opening hours for evenings as well due to popular demand.Well done folks
5
I had to do some work in Singapore and am staying near Arab St. My hotel recommended this cafe - and it's been great. Solid wifi, plugs for laptops, comfortable seating, good air conditioning, nice coffee, good service. I also really like the aesthetic of the place - good amount of dark wood
