It wont' go wrong to dine here if you're craving for Korean food. Marinated BBQ, pajeon and haemuljeon were so delicious. The atmosphere is nice too, you can book a room for group gathering.

This is real Korean restaurant. The food is very good - my favourite of course is grilled beef.
The only problem of the restaurant is the staff: impolite, inattentive and not professional. It is spoiling the nice overall impression on the restaurant.

This restaurant provides super value lunch menu and very generous side dishes to their customers. The seafood tofu soup is a must try and it simply taste super delicious!

Average meat quality with average pricing. Alittle smoky environment and staff were mostly not very service oriented need to be called upon numerous occasions to refill side dishes, tea and even complimentary vegetables wraps have to be asked then served up to us without any smiles from crew. Missable given so many others Korean restaurants in Sg I guess

Wang Dae Bak Located at #01-64 22 Cross Street China Square Central, A casual dining ambience Modelled after a typical barbecue restaurant in South Korea, the decor features round metal tables, robust chimney exhaust and plastic chairs, and the decent-sized restaurant seats 50 patrons comfortably. Wang Dae Bak whips up the finest Korean delights. Enjoy a unique spread of the freshest vegetables, seafood, chicken, and meats, the food that we tried was simply the best, Such as the spicy marinated chicken, Pork Bone Soup, Seafood Pancake, Prime Rib, Marinated Pork All had lots of flavour. On the whole a must try for all Korean food lovers, It gave me another view point of having Korean dining in a sophisticatedly way. The Staff are very professional the service is excellent and very friendly and attentive. The food is beyond expectations. Overall, So Satisfied, We Couldn't Ask For More

I was recommended to try the kimchi pancake, well I had not disappointment when dining here. My suggestion is you need to have more than 1 eater to finish the pancake, it's quite large. The taste was nice and crispy, in fact the kimchi taste was not heavy as expected, but the oiliness may make someone stay away from it. What made me happy was not the pancake, instead the stuff is the one who gave good service upon my request.

We are regular diners here as the food tastes authentic or at least similar to the food on our Korean trips. Service is usually good but they do get quite busy so you may have to work a bit harder to get the staff attention sometimes. Prices are reasonable for the quality you get. Lunch sets from $10

it is our usual haunt for lunch for a korean Fix. But they only serve BBQ for dinners so here we came for the fix. Quality of meat can be better but it was still yummy. Many many side dishes and free flow....... thats's good. Ginseng Chicken can be a little stronger in flavour.The kimchi pancakes and seafood pancakes were yummy. The cold noodles was refreshing, though I wished the serving was a bit smaller to leave room for the rest of the food. Great place for a cosy dinner . Not as smelly, hot and crowded as the other branch at amoy

Went for lunch today with 2 colleagues. We had the Army Stew ($38) and the Cheese Kimchi pancake ($24). The stew is really delicious and we finished it to the last drop including a second top up of the soup. By the time we reached the cheese kimchi pancake we were just too full and could only finish half of it. The pancake is huge and good enough for 4-5 pax. I find the pancake a bit too sour for my taste and probably will not order it again. The free side dishes are normal and forgettable. But definitely I will go back for the Army Stew again and try the BBQ next time. The place is at the far end of China Square Central, right next to the overhead bridge crossing over to the Hong Lim market.

Great experience trying korean bbq in Singapore. You will for sure leave with a full stomach! Great for group of friends for dinner.

The service was excellent along with the food, This is the type of place you wont leave feeling hungry !!

Came here often with colleagues for lunch. Lunch set cost around $10+. Value for money and very tasty. Service is prompt and food served fast. Definitely coming back! üëç

I love these Korean Restaurants where you get the raw meats and cook it for yourself on the Hot Plate on your table. It allows you to interact more with your friends like standing around a Barbecue being Social.
The food was amazing and plentiful.

Simple dishes little frills pretty humble settings. Had the marinated pork loin n prime ribs.. meat was very very good. Japchae so so..Prices reasonable n attentive staff. As with any Korean BBQ restaurant u walk out smelling of BBQ but get used to it!!!The only downside is that they insist on 2 BBQ sets of meat even though there were only two of us resulting in excessive food .Other than that thumbs up. Will be back

We made a reservation for two as advised by a friend fearing that it will be too crowded and we wouldn't get a table without it. Getting here isn't tough and the restaurant is pretty easy to locate. The nearest MRT station would be the Down Town Line China Town station. Exit the station from 'Exit F' and the restaurant is just a street away. The decor of the restaurant was really modern and sleek, as this is the newer branch (another being at Amoy street). We ordered the meat selections Set A, along with the Tofu Soup. All the meats we had were thoroughly marinated. The free flow egg and side dishes were really tasty as well. Also, the grill operates using real charcoal and not gas/electric stoves. What really made an impression on me was the attitude of the staff. Even though it was rather busy, they responded to requests promptly and always with a smile. I would not hesitate to return or introduce more friends and family to this fine establishment in the future. Keep up the good work

Had a BBQ dinner with family. First time to notice is the promptness of their service who attended to our need. Food serving was good and quality is there. Price is mid range for a typical restaurant in that area. Pity the place was full on a weekend and the smoke exhaust were not able to function to its optimum.
5
Very local and popular place. Some tourists come too. Busy, noisy, bustling. Full of smoke, steam, smell etc. the servings are huge. I was surprised how people can eat it up :)). Good pancakes, chicken and pork to roast on your table. Pickled veggies to go with. Nice culinary and cultural experience

The Korean BBQ shop is very well liked by locals. Set dinner was very worth it with a lot of BBQ portion and cooked food. However, felt that the small dishes are very limited and also the cold noodles is not exactly the real aunthentic taste. One problem is that the inner seats tend to have stronger smoky smell. Best is that you go there wearing some old clothes so that your clothes or hand bag will not have the strong smell. The cooked egg on the rim is good! And it is refillabl

We ordered seafood pancake, a plate of pork belly, 2 plates of chicken and moscato soju.The seafood pancake is very big and very fulfilling. Unlike some other Korean BBQ shop, We have to cook the meat ourselves. Food was not bad. I like their moscato soju, sweet n yummy. We came in 5 pax, total about $84
5
As my friend recommended, this is the absolutely the best Korean resutaurant in S'pore, or maybe in south asia. Foods are exellent. Especially Sundubu Chige is ausome. Staffs are all kind.

Recommended by a friends on their BBQ stuff.
It was a great dining experience. We really enjoy the food there.
5
Love the kimchi pancake and the bbq and esp. The egg. A great place to chill out with friends and have a delicious, hearty Korean meal.
5
Need to make reservations...serving nice BBQ food...the marinated chickens are delicious and they provide eggs where you can pour at the side of the grill...but prepare your clothing to get smell

We've were hanging out to try Korean BBQ, but this was disappointing. The food was slightly overpriced, not exceptionally tasty. The staff were very helpful and friendly, so much so, that they took over most of the grilling for us.All in all we enjoyed steamboat much much more, at a place with an unusual name "koipy" on mosque st. We stumbled across the other night. It was liquid gold

Made a reservation for dinner on a Wednesday evening and was seated at a cosy spot which allowed us some privacy. Staff were polite and attentive (consistently asking us if we wanted the egg river refilled when it was emptied, all the way till I was satiated, which is commendable). Food was pretty good. I specifically enjoyed the seafood pancake which was pretty large. It was really crispy around the edges, just as I like it. A group of 5 of us couldn't finish it though, but it could be because we ordered a lot (teehee). Will keep the restaurant in mind for gatherings in the future :

during busy days, service gets real poor, with staff ignoring your calls and when you personality walk up to them to get new orders, they wont acknowledge and just walk away. could be just a unlucky day for me. food wise excellent! good meat marination. love the unlimited free flow of egg at the side!definitely one of the more authentic Korean food places in Singapore
4
We liked it here alot and we usually eat quite abit here. The atmosphere is good and the service is good as well. Do be prepared to queue for the dinner/weekend or it is better to make reservations before going down.Only downside is that shirt will be smelly.. But they will provide a spray to remove the smell so not so bad. :
5
At S$11.00 plus all the usual Korean condiments this has to be the best value full lunch meal in town. No wonder there is a queue. The best value only works if you go alone because you don't have to share the free kimchi with anyone. Highly recommended for busy white collar crowd

We visited Wang Dae Bak Korean Bbq Restaurant and it is one of my wife's favourite Korean BBQ Restaurant in Singapore. Service by staff is friendly, food is really delicious but i find that it is slightly overpriced. We always ordered the set because it is more affordable
4
We tried the BBQ this time. It was nice. And the side dishes were nice as well. I love the mashed potatoes. The service was good and the price is affordable as well
5
We visited the wang dae bak in Amoy street but couldn't find the place to review. Assuming it is the same quality: this was awesome. A really fun experience for the family, with excellent food and nice staff. Definitely highly recommended
5
Last minute walk in to restaurant at 2125 and staff still served us with last call at 2130! Despite this we didn't feel rushed. Supervisor was extremely friendly and recognised that we weren't entirely sure how to get started and came over to cook for us! We ordered a set meal and meats were amazing. We also got noodles and seafood pancakes. Meal was not cheap but well worth it! Highly recommended.
5
I went there to have Korean food for the first time in my life. I have chosen that restaurant because of a few websites and the recommendations here on tripadvisor. I was there with my girlfriend and we ordered a plate for two and a soup, it was a lot and we really couldn't finish all of it. The staff was quite amazing. Thank you Harace for the Korean noodles and the nice talks. I'd really recommend that place though the quality was good and the meals reasonably priced

My girlfriend introduce me to Wang Dae Bak BBQ Restaurant, not knowing what to expect as i'm pretty skeptical with the Korean cuisine food in Singapore aside from Togi Restaurant.To my surprise, the food here is outstanding, one of the dishes i would highly recommend apart from the BBQ is the ginseng chicken soup which is superb! the service staff over there provide top-notch services as well :) I would highly recommend Wang Dae Bak BBQ restaurant for people looking for authentic Korean cuisine at an affordable price! The restaurant location is easily accessible as wel

The food here is outstanding! And eating here is quite a spectacle. The experienced staff carefully but efficiently bring out a bucket of hot coals that they place into a recess in the middle of your table. They then cover it with a hotplate which will be used to cook the myriad marinated meats, eggs, mushrooms, etc that you can order from the extensive menu. It was so delicious my wife and I had to stop talking for the first 10 minutes to just sit there devouring it! If you're an inexperienced Westerner like we were, the staff will help you cut up the meat and place it onto the hotplate, but part of the fun is to then do this yourself. Go for the marinated steak and the mushroom selection

5 of us had large spicy tofu soup, chap chai, prime beef, pork, largest seafood pancake ever, all for SGD23 each. I've tried Korean at several places and this is very delicious. Only downside is table for 4 is already crowded and small. Exhaust fumes will get onto clothes too. Superb service, there's a bell to get service

Place served delicious Korean charcoal bbq food. The Makgoelli beer served in a metal bowl make the beer seem to taste even better. Ha ha. Pancake was big. Pity only one size so if there is only 2 of you, you might not be able to try other variety of food. Unless you want to keep half of it to take away later.Egg on the sides of the hot plate is simply delicious. and don't forget to bbq the rice cake at the side of the hot plate. It's crispy on the outside and soft on the inside.Only grouse I have was.. The table is a little small for the food and our cutlery and drinks. And yes.. If only the lettuces were bigger leaves ..Overall very satisfied. And planning on return visits with other friends

Korean pancake was yummy. Soft on the inside and crispy on the outside. Portion is really big!Bbq was nice too. They even allow you to bbq egg at the side of the hotplate. Some of the side dishes was nice too. The fresh lettuce for bbq could have been more chilled and bigger
4
Me and group of colleagues eat there almost fortnightly for lunch. For $10-12, there is unlimited side dishes, free flow tea! The main course is also always flawless, no complaints at all!The staff are efficient, although not overly friendly.The best lunch place in raffles place/Chinatown area!PS: note that dinner menu is different from lunch and prices are much higher. Mainly BBQ items.Tip: do book in advance for dinner as they are fully booked on Friday.
