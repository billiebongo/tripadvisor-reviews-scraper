Terrible food and service. Mushroom vegetable dish tasted tinned and spicy soup was like dish water. Chicken was like pigeon meat. Filthy toilets and rude staff. Do not eat here. Walk down the street and go somewhere for decent food that’s a lot cheaper
3
Not offensive but nothing to make this place stand out either. Felt we could have got food of a similar quality from the street traders probably at a lower cost.
5
We visited on a Friday evening and had the Singapore Chilli Crab. This was the first time that we have had the dish. It was superb and will be having it again next time that we are in Singapore.
4
Rated this restaurant. Generous servings, fast service, reasonable prices, great duck.....what more could you want. Definitely worth a visit.
5
We liked this place so much we came back for a second time. We loved the sweet and sour pork and the honey ribs. I'm not a duck fan but the other people in our party loved the duck. At first they came out and cut it up and make appetizers. They then took it away. They took all of the duck off the bones and made a stir fry out of it and brought it back out to the table. I heard the stir fry was outstanding. Also, the tiger beer was only 8 dollars. The bottle was about a liter and I was only expecting a 12 oz. bottle which would be typical in the U.S. so we thought that was a great price compared to other places we drank at in Singapore
5
Travelling from Australia to Singapore, Fatty's is always on our shortlist of restaurants. The "Nuclear Chicken" (known as Hotpot chicken on the menu) is highly recommended; and the salted egg yolk prawns are superior to similar dishes at high-end restaurants in Singapore. And the duck - can't be faulted. We went back a second time on this trip just for the duck - the flavour and tenderness is better than anything we can get in Australia
4
There are many places to eat in Chinatown but I'd been advised by my sister in law that a trip to Fatty Weng was a must. We were not disappointed, there is a good choice of food and the Fried Noodles were just lovely, and not unreasonably priced
3
You can definitely find better food within a 1 block radius but this is a nice air conditioned place with very professional and nice staff. Has the feeling of a tourist trap and it definitely is a bit pricey compared to surrounding competition. If you want a safe comfortable place without all the hustle and yelling of the better chinatown spots, this is your place
5
This was the second time we have visited this restaurant (1st time 3 years ago) and ordered Peking Duck. (PKD)So often when you retrace past experiences there is disappointment - NOT THIS TIME. The duck was as sumptious as before and our stir fry dish of duck with ginger delicious. Beer very cold and service excellent.A few days later we then compared PKD in Hong Kong (at the Trip Advisor #1 rated PKD restaurant) but Fatty Weng's wins hands down. HK duck was moist but the pancakes were very heavy, more like a wrap, and no second dish was offered as normally expected except at extra cost
4
I visited Fatty Wengâ€™s on my own. I needed to sit down with a cold beer and something nice to eat!It was very hot in the street - humidity was through the roof!The cold beer arrived quickly, and then it was time to look at the menu. A good seat at an outside table provided a place to watch the world go by.My choice of Sweet and Sour Pork arrived looking very appealing! It was full of fresh vegetables and tasted perfect...probably the best that I have had. The Pork was cooked perfectly and the sauce was just right. A great meal to set me up for the evening
4
I can truly recommend truly this restaurant. Authentic food and a good portion . Lemon Chicken war the best.
3
Fast service and fast food. Little Fatty served us, he was very helpful. Beer wasn't cheap but where is it cheap in this town? I ordered the vermicelli and it was surprising... luckily there were others on hand to help finish it for me.
4
This restaurant had great food but it took up to 1 hour for all the food to arrive. Very disappointing!!

Nice Cantonese Cuisine
Was a fan of their food since their beginnings at Guillemard Road

Good value and nostalgic food.
Brings back memories of old school Chinese restaurant cuisine. Nothing fanciful but just good enough to keep us satisfied and happy.
4
Great service here without question. Good was quite good. Quite pricey though for the serving size. If unfamiliar with the area, this is safe choice in a nice setting.
1
Quite unethical stuff coming from this place. You order a duck and they bring it out to you only to return it to the back and give you a single stir fried dish. I guess 50% of it was missing when it came back to us.I argued, then the waitress acknowledged that it wasn't a full duck and went to get manager. Then manager offers to give free dessert for them DELIBERATELY STEALING FROM THEIR CUSTOMERS.I've ordered 50+ beijing ducks (from all parts of mainland china, chinatowns in new york and chicago, and now singapore) and never once felt like I'd been cheated this bad.1 full duck should be enough for 3 people. What was delivered to us wasn't enough for my wife and her mother. How is that even possible
3
I was impressed with their warmth, friendly welcoming behaviour and speed of service. That was the best part in our dining.Other than that, was really normal/average.It wasn't that wow impressive chinese food. Wasn't bad, but was okay'sh.The one thing that can be easily noticed is there is not cook art and talent in the dish. Surely not mouthwatering.Coming from London, have found that chinese food and dining there is so delicious that can be easily memorable.In short, go there is you are hungry....and you want to eat. But don't seek a top eating joy
4
After a day of touring, sightseeing and rejection at Clarke Quay we ventured to China town and found this oasis. Great food, respectful service ( a few items were missing from our feast) but this had no impact on yummy food and cold beer. A great find in a busy environment.
1
We called in here for lunch on a Friday but the sulky miserable waitress was not happy that we were not ready to order when she came back to our table.She then blatantly avoided coming back to take our table and left us waiting, we were bemused.We walked out after twenty minutes, worst service ever! Fatty Wengs has apparently been open since 1967, living off past glories I think
4
We are here because most other places were closing and this was still open! Service ok, food was good with plenty of it. We struggled to finish it all! Reasonably priced.
5
Fantastic service ..
Fantastic food ...
Made all my family feel welcome and relaxed and explained the menu fully ! Even found $50 on floor which is worth the tip !!!
If back in Chinatown will definitely call again 👌
4
During our stay we visited China town twice and dined here on both occasions food was good and staff very friendly and at prices which were relatively cheap in comparison to parts of the city
4
Every visit to Singapore we make time for Peking Duck and a beer at Fatty Weng in Chinatown
Great location, great food and great value
4
Good Peking duck with double service .
Good sauce and tiger beer .
Staff is cordial . Not cheap but good quality .
4
Had dinner here with family. It was quite costly for 4 but the meal was excellent. Had the Singapore chilli crab on the recommendation of the waiter. Our opinion all round the table was- meh! Its an overrated meal.
3
We had come to Chinatown Food Street to walk round the stalls and have some dinner. At 9.30pm many of the restaurants had started to close but Fatty Weng was open. The food was ok, normal Chinese menu. Service was good and friendly staff. Small portions are big enough for 2 to share, the rice too
4
After shopping in Chinatown we're making our way to Chinatown Seafood for their S$6.95 Tiger Beer when we came across this place. Same beer price, great deal for S'pore, but also a nice, very clean little restaurant. Very attentive staff, and even though we only had mee were very pleased. Prices a higher than hawker stalls, but reasonable.
4
We have previously been to the Fatty Weng Restaurant, but not for several years and in that time it has had a makeover. It used to have Peking duck hanging in the window with photos of the owner along with influential customers on the wall. All now disappeared, the ducks because of health and safety legislation. However the duck was as good as ever and is recommended. The restaurant is good value and we ate there 3 times. Charging for the nuts is a bit OTT but we realised they were an additional cost and refused them, however we did need the hand wipes and a decent napkin would be a welcome addition to the service which is good
4
This restaurant is probably the best one in the China Town of Singapore. My beautiful young wife and I enjoyed the Peking duck twice in that place, which was surprisingly good: crispy skin, tender juicy meat, carving before guests' eyes. Quite similar to that of Beijing restaurants, except for the soup, which is lacking here
3
Came across this place whilst wandering around chinatown looking for a pit stop for lunch. It looked OK so in we went.
Typical chinese fare, no real complaints from us but it was nothing special. Service was reasonable. Overall, quite pricey.
1
Getting charged for facial towelettes and a crappy bowl if nuts ripped off Don't bother going food is average workers bored stiff
4
This was fun and there was plenty to choose from, plus more than you could want quantity wise. Very good, fast service. Delicious food. Recommended.
4
Reasonably priced restaurant in Chinatown, we drank beers and ate our faces off. It was delicious and the portions are huge.
5
Been here 3 times now on each visit to Singapore. Service is great, the food amazing and not overly priced.
4
Visited on a Saturday lunch time. Service and food were very good. Situated in a very busy area of Chinatown I would guess that you will fall across this restaurant rather than find it. If you do find it I don't think you'll be disappointed.
5
Excellent meal provided a good price in good time by very friendly accommodating staff. Well worth a visit
4
We ate here in 2005 when we were last in Singapore and had enjoyed it greatly. Consequently we decided to return to sample the Crispy duck.The restaurant interior is not as I remember. The tables do not have table cloths and to my disappointment, there are no napkins or tissues to protect your lap or to wipe your fingers on.However! They do place a moist tissue on the table pre- wrapped variety you get on a plane - yet these are disgracefully not free and you are charged on the bill if you use them. We were also brought some of those nuts - sort of Bombay mix whilst we looked at the menu and the young waitress murmured something as she placed on the table but not in English. It wasn't until after we'd sampled one or two we saw on the menu these are chargeable too! Very cheeky. I don't even like them.Ordered 1/2 crispy duck and the waitress sliced the skin off and a waiter then wrapped inside pancakes. This wasn't as nice as I remembered and there was some sloppy fat underneath some of the skin which I don't like - all mushy in your mouth. The remainder of the duck was stir fried in a black pepper sauce, nice but too much.We also had some fried dumplings which were not pleasant.A glass of wine served in a tiny glass full to the brim and husband a beer.It's on the tourist trail and wouldn't necessarily recommend, not because of food quality more because I felt it is rather stingy to charge you for a moist napkin which is soooo small.Toilets located upstairs, dirty
4
Our last day in Singapore after 3 weeks on the QM2, had a gorgeous meal in Fatty Wengs, the staff were great even helped me with the chop sticks, will definitely go again next time we are in Singapore.Richard & Susan Croft West Yorkshire. UK
3
We had an early lunch there. Food was acceptable but nothing special. Found it a bit overpriced to what I am used to have in Chinese places across Asia. Recommend the food stalls in the street, who seem to offer similar dishes at slightly more reasonable prices. Some staff was friendly other rather indifferent
5
We went to Chinatown for our first dinner in Singapore. Staff were very helpful and attentive. Food was fantastic! we will definately return.
1
Food was very average. We all had upset stomachs after eating this evening. We were charged for nuts and wet towels that were on the table when we sat down. The only good thing was the air conditioning.
4
my husband and I dined at this lovely Chinese restaurant and had a great dish of sweet and sour pork, rice and drinks. Loved the atmosphere(we say outside)
1
An expensive place to have dinner with the family. Dishes were small and food was only so-so. Two thumbs down.
4
Very friendly waiter (Lionel) recommended pork ribs, Peking duck, we added the egg fried rice and Chinese mushrooms everything was delicious with Tiger beer to wash it all down with..... yummy a little pricey for lunch but look at what all 4 of us ate....
3
Not sure how authentically Singaporean is this restaurant, but food was alright, the peking duck was great and so were all the other dishes. However, given that it is in China town, i am not sure i would head back there as there are other choices to choose from
4
We stopped by here by chance. Had not reviewed prior to sitting down.We sat outside. Hint: sit under the fan, it provides a nice cooling breeze.Service was prompt, very pleasant. We had chicken wings done in a fish sauce deep fried. Different, but good. We also had sweet and sour pork. Excellent. Portions sizes (we had the large) were more than adequate. Two large Tiger beers and a relax, watching the world go by! We enjoyed our experience here. Recommende
4
We sat on a table outside basically in the road and wondered if we had made the right choice of restaurant. Food was so good especially the Peking duck that was sliced in front of us put into pancakes and then the remainder taken to the kitchen to be served in a delicious sauce. This place does not look much from the outside but worth going to for the atmosphere you are surrounded by and the great food
4
So we couldn't be bothered trawling through Chinatown looking at restaurants.We were hungry and the big cheap Tiger beer advert pulled us in. Went for half a Peking duck together with a fried rice. Both tasted great and there was enough for 2 of us. With 3 large Tiger the bill was around 80 SGD. Not a cheap meal, but the service was good and the outside seats are great for people watching
5
We had lunch on two occasions at this restaurant and one both occasions it was delicious. It was great to escape the heat and humidity of China Town. The food was delicious and the service was great. If you visit China Town we would recommend this small restaurant.John & Gail Lane
4
A nice restaurant with a terrace a bit of the street and thus a possibility to have quietly some good food. And this you find certainly in Fatty Weng! The menu is different then in the other places and it has good choices. You can choose between small and large protions. And the portions are large! The service is excellent. Very quick and with a lot of attention. We had the chicken in special sauce and the beef with black pepper. The rice with small silver fish was also delicious. The price is fairly reasonable. Anyway the quality of the food is good, so this compensates a lot. I'm certainly going back
5
Visited just before Chinese New Year so it's very colourful. Allow extra time to get to the restaurant because the area is heaving with people. Great buzz. Felt perfectly safe.The restaurant seems chaotic but our service was 1st class and the food excellent.We shared a half duck, had small lemon chicken, small spare ribs and it was almost too much for 2
3
Had the crab, whole baked fish and pork ribs ( as most tourists do) - very very nice but we had similar dishes previously for far less cost. Beers were pricey and couldn't get bottled water. Next meal we went to the street stalls and ate in the communal eating area, had a great time. Go here if you need the air con, otherwise eat like the locals
4
Wanted to try some authentic Chinese food whilst in Chinatown and Fatty Weng didn't disappoint. Nice table, clean, Tiger beer, soup, sweet and sour pork with rice, all served quickly by very friendly staff. We had a great night, so much so,we went back the following day for lunch. Really good, give it a go!
3
We had too much hawker food on our Singapore trip and wanted some original chinese food in chinatown. This restaurant is conveniently located and has a modern design and friendly staff. We had their signature fish and 4 more main dishes: all in all good food but high price and small portion (even if you order medium size)
5
Stopped here for lunch while in Chinatown. Very busy place, but service was very quick and although we only intended to have a light lunch, the food was so good, we were quite full by the time we left. We didnt have the Peking duck, which is their speciality, but others around us did, and it looked delicious. A definite must if your in Chinatown
5
Reserved table for 8 for lunch. A variety of dishes, but Peking duck was the fave. Crispy skin carved at the table and the waiter rolled up the pancakes with spring onions plum sauce and the crispy skin. The rest of the duck was carved and served separately. Delicious
4
Just stopped off for a snack here, didn't try the recommended jellyfish salad but had our first crispy duck. Served with a cold beer and a side of deep fried chicken, delicious. Not as cheap as the hawker bar on the rest of the street but well worth it if you aren't confident on the street food way of eating
1
Waited for 20 minutes for someone to take our food order. Then another 25 minutes for it to arrive on our table (it's in the wok was the stock answer when I enquired about the delay)It should of stayed in the wok. The beef was greasy and rancid the plate of food was of such a poor standardThen go figure we get charged for the towels which where already on the tableGIVE THIS PLACE A MISS. AN OVERPRICED TOURIST TRAP THAT DOES NOT NEED TO RELY ON REPEAT BUSINESS
4
After walking through Chinatown for quite some time, we picked Fatty Weng. Staff was very friendly, but we didn't get the food at the same time. So 3 of us had their meals and 1 had to wait very long. When we finally got the bill, we were quite shocked. We didn't order any exclusive dishes, just some fried rice and chow mein and some meat, but it was really expensive. This wasn't the first restaurant we had been to in Singapore, so we could compare the prices. The food was good, but too expensive. There's so much more in Chinatown
5
We had a delicious dinner, with excellent lemon chicken, and good priced beer (for Singapore), service was very pleasant and attentive. We would definitely go back.
4
Had no idea where to eat, so many choices. Found Fatty Weng for lunch. Ordered the half Peking duck, fried rice, chicken soup, dumplings and a bottle of wine. $116 Singapore dollars. Fantastic food and service. Air conditioning. Would certainly return.
5
We had a family of 10 and they had no problem seating us. We had the Peking duck. And that was amazing. Highly recommend trying it.
5
We keep coming back to this restaurant for the lemon chicken. Perfect crispy chicken and perfect lemon sauce.
Sweet&Sour pork - eat it all!
Everything on the "favourite" meny - we love :-)
Always welcoming and service minded waiters.
Will be back!
3
Having dinner outside on the street, the fact that the restaurant is in China town, makes it special. Food is good although they use too much sesame in their dishes. Most enjoyable place for a Chinese dinner.
4
I took my relatives visiting Singapore to Chinatown last night. I was looking for a value-for-money resto for dinner, and chose Fatty Weng after some quick Googling. Most of the reviews said the food was tasty BUT there were 'surprise' charges in the receipt. I was ready to tell off the waiters to remove the wet napkins, nuts, etc., but I was pleasantly surprised when they asked us from the get-go whether we want these 'extra charge' items or not. In fact, they had put up a couple of notices on the table placards about this already so the waiters reminding us again was stepping up on their part. This tells me the resto actually reads the user reviews and listens to their customers.Needless to say, the food was great - we all enjoyed everything we ordered: peking duck, honey pork ribs, salted egg prawns and veggies w/ assorted eggs. Prices were reasonable given the location, resto ambiance, excellent service and food quality. I will be returning to Fatty Weng again! Satisfied customer right here
3
Ok..not good not bad...the "since 1967" sucked me in...it may be typical in Singapore but they forced the purchase of wet naps on the bill and did a forced gratuity that I didn't notice till later so I double tipped...the fried rice was actually really good, but how hard is that to make..the chile prawns were hot and decent...id keep walking
4
Adapted a noodle dish for a vegetarian and was tasty without the meat. I had the chillie crab which was a treat as it was very expensive. The crab was beautiful but very messy. The staff were very accommodating. Got busy later and there were lots of staff on hand to help with our order. Nice clean restaurant and rest room
5
We looked around for Peking duck and didn't want to pay crazy prices nor order ahead. We made our way to Fatty Weng in the middle of Chinatown and it was great. Had half a duck with their homemade pancakes and had the rest cooked schezuan style and it was awesome. Added some seafood noodles and we were done! All outstanding and great place to watch people walking around Chinatown. Highly recommend for mid priced good food
4
I don't want to put the place down totally, as the food was very tasty and Siem of the best I've had in Singapore all week.The staff was friendly at first and brought out a mixed nut blend and sauce , on two small dishes . We thought they were commentary and found out when we received the bill that we had been charged for them , as well as for the wet napkin .Besides that , the dishes were reasonably priced , and tasty , so not a perfect stop , but nowhere near a bad one as well
3
Food was SO good, tasty and served quickly. All services were quick and polite. Everything clean.
Prices reasonable considering everything in Singapore is so expensive.
4
Our lunch experience at Fatty Weng's was overall very good. Had the Peking Duck as a starter and main. Was delicious. Service was very good, restauraunt ambience good (air conditioning was appreciated after hours of shopping) and price was reasonable.
4
I would love to rate this 5 but our table kept getting dripped on and we also could not have peaking duck as sold out!
But apart from that amazing food, service and location!
5
Exceptional food and service - freshly prepared and great variety to choose from as we had rice, noodles, dumplings, and two soups. Great break from early afternoon visit to Chinatown - highly recommend to sit inside as it was cool and cozy.
5
Great wait staff and excellent service. Food choice is great. Good for a group like we were. Highly recommend.
5
I enjoyed my meal there last week ; Ordered their Specialty dishes such as Deep Fried Soon Hock Fish, Baked Honey Pork Ribs, Seafood Combination Clay Pot. Yum Yum 👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼
1
Visited with my vietnamese friend during vacation and we were both craving food. We spotted this place and as I love peking duck we chose it. We get seated and the servant mutters all the answers to our questions regarding the menu. When the peking duck came in with a servant mixing it up for us, I politely ask for some sugar on it since that's how I like it - no matter what. The servant looks and me and answers me as if I were stupid. In general the service and servants were rude and not service-minded at all, some of them starring at us while eating. The food we ordered - the Peking duck was okay
1
we stopped here for lunch due to the air con and the 3 small children in tow on a very hot day. we ordered one chicken dish and fried rice for the children. we added a basic broccoli dish that we later got charged $18 ++ for.total bill of over $100 for lunch with not even one dish each.buyer beware!
5
We were not specifically looking at eating here, we just chose the restaurant as we walked past and I am so glad we did. Great staff, friendly and not pushy, food was delicious and fresh and tasty. Was not too expensive for what you got. A great find, and if we did not have a local with us we would not even had known about this place.
3
Excellent Peking duck, carved up and pancakes assembled at the table very professionally. Duck meat is then presented separately. At $35 for a half duck, it's not cheap once you add in extra's and tax. You also have to order rice and Gai lan extra if you want to make it a full meal. Everything, first and second course came out at the same time. But please, stop the surprises when you come to pay. No serviettes at all on the table, and initially we thought what a nice touch to have a damp one in a bag, coming in from the 95% humidity. And the very small, two tablespoons of mixed peanuts on the table we also thought were complimentary, until we came to pay. I know it's not much to add on another $2.50 or so to our meal but it's a bit cheeky! All up our meal was $70 which included a Diet Coke and beer
5
We stopped here for lunch and weren't disappointed. The food was delicious and the staff very helpful and friendly.
5
Reluctant at first to try street food on the first night of a cruise but we went for it and we were not disappointed.
Sit out on the street and watch the world go by.
5
Best Crispy duck pancakes I have ever had!!!
Staff were nice and friendly and the food was delicious
If you are visiting China town definitely check this place out!
5
Basic restaurant with close tables, but the food was fantastic. I had a prawn dish which was the best i;ve ever had.
4
Had a light meal of Peking duck and Tiger beer.Just what was needed after a long days travelling. We had planned to go somewhere else; but they were closed for a private party. We stumbled upon Fatty Weng without reading any reviews and therefore had no preconceptions.While our choice of duck may seem a little to safe for some it provided a simple light meal we thoroughly enjoyed
4
Had dinner here - food was as good as d as I remember and great service too. Duck amazing, and expertly carved at the table, fried rice first class and honey chicken melted in the mouth. Not the flashiest of places to dine overall but the quality and quantity of food makes it well worth a visit - you won't be disappointed
4
We wanted to eat in the local hawker food market up on level 2 but it was too dam hot so we searched for a restaurant with air con and found Fatty Weng.After a quick scan of the menu we settled on the deep fried fish and pork ribs plus two icy cold tiger beers.Both the pork ribs and fish were sensational - I did not look closely at the pricing on the menu so when I went to pay I almost choked ! the restaurant is not an upmarket place and does appear to be a cheap eat from the outside but the bill of $110 was a surprise with the fish costing $50 - I suppose the tip is check the pricing and make sure you are ok with this
4
My husband and I ordered a variety of dishes, including half a duck, which was expertly carved at the table and the crispy skin made into pancakes for us. We were more than happy with the food we received, it was all very tasty. The staff were attentive and friendly too. We left, feeling that we had enjoyed a truly authentic Chinese meal (different to anything we'd had previously in the UK)
4
Fatty Weng's is right in the middle of Chinatown and looking like it could just be a tourist trap. For us it was much better than that. We had a nice balanced meal including some delightful bean curd and mushrooms, excellent fish, and a really nice chewy deep-fried beef dish (the name of which escapes me). We would be happy to go back
4
We are always very impressed with their Egg Fried Rice whom I think it's the best in Singapore. The vegetables are also very very good irregardless of the cooking method. The staff are generally polite and service oriented. We had vegetables, fried rice and prawn paste chicken and all tasted good. The only think I thought is that the price are bit pricey. A good place for tourists but there are cheaper good (if not better) food elsewhere. The egg fried rice is one of the best in Singapore though.
4
This is the first place you come to in Food Street. There's always a tendency to keep looking but its worth saving yourself time and stopping here. Good value, tasty food and fast service.
4
In the heart of Chinatown, good quality food and friendly staff. Sweet and sour pork was lovely. Peking crispy duck was great too.
5
We went here on the recommendation of the concierge at the Fairmont hotel where we were staying. I have to admit, it is nothing to look at as restaurants go but I have travelled Asia many times and it is what it is.The restaurant was hectic, leading up tho the Chinese new year. We didn't wait long for a table, the service was erratic and very disjointed, so many staff not following any set order of service of managing tables in a particular section. Although when we did receive our meal in stages and not all together I have to say it was the best lemon chicken I have ever had in the world. It was divine, it was a huge plate and never thought I would manage. It was just too good to leave, I had to devour it
4
the food here was really tasty ,the portions are generous and there is plenty of choice on the menu. also the beers are some of the cheapest i came across in singapore this place is in bustling china town ,it was great to sit down and watch all the tourist activity on the surrounding stalls.it was extremly popular and you may have to wait if you want an inside (air conditioned table
3
Passed by this restaurant and liked the look of it. Friendly staff and fast service, but the food was average. The advantage was there was quite a lot of it if you're hungry - good portion sizes. The best choice was the beef in black bean sauce which was tender and delicious, but the lemon chicken was disappointingly sweet, like lemon curd, and the chicken with ginger stew was almost inedible to our taste. If you choose well you could have a good meal here
3
I walked in after reading the good reviews here on TA. To be honest I don't get what's the big fuss over this restaurant. The food was ok, nothing too impressive -- very basic Chinese food. Don't try the corn soup -- came very bland. Service was ok. Overall, I wouldn't recommend for this cheap Chinese food, which isn't, by the price , cheap at all. Try other locations or if all fails just to Burger King -- if you go for fast food, you might as well pay fast food prices
2
In a good location in Chinatown, this place was busy and had a pleasant atmosphere. Our drinks order was taken very soon after we sat down and arrived very quickly, which was much appreciated after wandering around Chinatown in the heat. Sadly it was down hill from there. It took a long time for someone to take our order and it took over an hour for one of the dishes to arrive. When it did, it was not worth the wait, nothing special here
4
Had a birthday lunch celebration for my dad with family yesterday. The food was good, though we felt a little thirsty thereafter, we guessed it must be the MSG in the food we ate. The staff were all so friendly which made us felt so welcomed.
4
We stopped for lunch. The food was good in terms of choice, quality and quantity. The service was friendly and efficient. It is leaning towards being expensive and as others have noted being charged for hand wipes and a little bowl of nuts is unnecessary. On weekdays they offer a set course menu but this is not available at the weekend
3
If you are hungry and just want to eat something quick and not to pricy, the restaurant is a good choice. If you are not too hungry the small plates are enough. Service was good and friendly. Just beware that penuts and wet towels are charged extra!
1
The only thing good to us was that it has air conditioning in a hot day. However, we didn't like the food at all. Furthermore, it is very pricey as well.
5
One of the best crab I have ever had!!! Don't hesitate to go for the Singapore Chili Crab: it is not hot at all and very tasty. Loved it!
5
The absolute best Chinese food I have ever tasted. I have travelled extensively through Asia and was amazed at how good the food was. Good value for money, air conditioned. Great place to taken family when in China Town
5
The chilli crab was excellent well cooked & large serving.
Service good & staff were excellent
Easy to find in Chinatown.
Great place to eat & have drink.
5
Loved this place, Found it on our first night and went back on our last. Great food, great staff and service.....loved it.
4
We were invited to an anniversary celebration of a Cantonese clan association. Since this restaurant is known for its Cantonese cuisine, we were looking forward to enjoying the best they have to offer. I was personally disappointed. While there is quantity, the quality is lacking. I only enjoyed the Peking duck (which is not a Cantonese item). the other 7 main items (including cold platter, shark fin soup, mushroom & brocolli, sweet slices o pork chop, noodles with duck meat, teamed fish, ...) were just average
3
We revisited this Restaurant as we had been there two years ago and enjoyed a lovely crispy duck meal. This time howeverthe restaurant had changed hands and although the venue had been modernised the quality of the food was not as good. We were also taken aback when being presented with the bill we had been charged for the hand wipe and a dish of peanuts which were already on the table when we arrived, certainly a tourist rip off. It was not a cheap meal so no need to charge for extras which we were not informed of in advance. This was the only restaurant in Singapore where this happened. We will not be dining at Fatty Weng next year when we do our annual visi

We wanted to eat a traditional Singaporean chilli crab and thankfully chose Fatty Wengs. We knew we were in for a treat when the waitress tied bibs round our necks and we weren't disappointed. The crab, the divine sauce and little bread rolls were truly orgasmic. I so hope I can go back and repeat the experience again
4
We stumbled across the place, mainly because we were looking to have wine with our dinner. We had lemon chicken which was really nice, different from home and not fatty. The service was good too. Only negative is that they put nuts down in front of you when you sit down but charge you for them. Also you pay for your napkin, but it does tell you this on their men
5
Visited Chinatown for food; dined air conditioned in 'Fatty Weng's ( you can also sit outside). Wife had Lemon Chicken and Chilli Crab, beautifully cooked and presented. So impressed we returned the following evening eating again inside, beef in black pepper, and large prawn omlette with noodles; again excellent food, reasonably priced dishes. Staff most helpful and gave excellent advice on dismembering a chilli crab! Would recommend for quality Chinese food and friendly staff.

Once again another great meal ,service excellent ,staff remembered me even though it was 12 months ago that I had visited the restaurant , the meal was beautiful ,and prices reasonable will visit again
4
Nice food at a good price. Just what I needed. Although the staff were a little pushy and it seemed like they were trying to hurry me and get me out.
5
We had crab & sweet corn soup followed by salt & pepper prawns with fried rice. Amazing flavors and seafood was fresh
4
Pleasantly surprised to find great food in the tourist - aimed Food Court in Chinatown. Staff carved a half Peking Duck for us and it was perfect. I can also recommend the salt and chilli prawns. Great meal with helpful & efficient staff
4
Saw this as walking in the foodcourt area, looked clean and had an inside eating area so decided to go in.not a huge menu choice but we had two dishes, lemon chicken and sweet and sour pork, with a bowl of boiled rice and egg fried rice, it was very nice food. 2 tigers beers and the total cost include service charge 10% & govt tax at 7% was $59.This would be about the same in the UK.we found the staff friendly and took time to speak with you, asked if we wanted forks but we said we would go with chopsticks. A nice meal.
4
We stopped here for dinner as the restaurant looked clean and we could sit inside in air conditioning. There were quite a few other patrons inside as well.Staff were great, very friendly and the food was delicious. The servings are quite large. I ordered the small servings of sweet and sour pork with Yung Zho fried rice, and it could easily have served 2 people. My friend had the prawn noodles and the small size was plentiful for one.Drinks were a bit expensive for a can of coke at $3.20. The sweet and sour pork and rice was $22 excl GST and service charge, and the noodles with prawns was $13.Note : a small bowl of peanuts are placed on the table as well as wet ones, and are charged to your bill at the end unless you tell them up front to take them away.Nice for a meal, reasonably priced
1
Came here and had a really bad experience. The food was flavorless... Literally flavorless. It was also extremely greasy. On top of the bad food... The wait staff practically insisted that I use a fork. I know I'm not a chopstick pro but I found it really rude. Bummed I wasted my money here. Definitely can't recommend
4
Two of us dined. We chose the deep fried Soon Hock fish specialty- comes with a sort of oyster sauce, and was pretty tasty, cost around S$42. Added a mixed veg dish (~S$14), some Yang Zhou fried rice (~S$8) and a couple of Tiger beers ... price was S$93, which seems a bit expensive, although that may be common in SIngapore considering the 10% service + 7% GST. Being charged for the wet-wipes (60c) and nuts ($S1) seems to be standard around there too, so wouldn't get worked up about it. (The night before we dined nearby and total price was around S$50 for two dishes + 1 steamed rice and a couple of beers and no GST charge ...). Staff were pleasant, service was quick, air-con was good and restaurant was busy. As we were finishing I noticed the diners nearby had been given a more extensive menu - don't know why we only had the large one page one, but if you want to see more dishes, make sure you get the big menu
3
As the restaurant is at the beginning of the Chinatown food street, this one seems to be not the best choice. Although the service was Ok, the prices are definitely high, and the food is just normal. So, I would recommend to consider options further on the street, for both quality and value
3
Popped in for a quick lunch while visiting China Town in Singapore, service was Ok location is not bad on a corner just before the main food drag i had a crispy pork dish with a veg fried Noodle which was tasty. i would consider it value formoney due to location
3
To expensive for this quality level, normal food, slowly service. They are talking to the people at the street.
4
We have been to Fatty Wengs a few times now and it always manages to impress. We usually sit inside and have never had a problem with service.
4
This was a pretty good restaurant in the heart of Singapore's Chinatown. We were looking for a place to avoid the heat and get some good food and I feel like we found the right place. The pork was good, as was the fried rice.
4
The staff were friendly and advised us on our meal choice. All the staff had a very pleasant approach and were attentive to our requests.
The food was well presented and very hot.
All in all a great place to eat.
5
On a very busy corner of Smith (FOOD) Street in Chinatown, we sat outside and enjoyed watching the world go past.Food was fantastic, service was great, beer was cold. Had Peking duck,that was made with the skin and the meat was served with onion and ginger, I'm drooling now just thinking about it. For half a duck that was $35.00. Fatty Weng's is enough reason to visit Singapore IMHO
5
Our first main meal after arriving in Singapore. Came across it by chance.a young lady enticed us nicely into a very small restaurant. We surmised it was good as there were 7 waitresses.! Service was speedy & efficient. Dishes were explained to us. We chose two prawn dishes,small portions.The chilli prawns with noodles were great. The Tiger prawns were enormous and superb.I would recommend this eatery to anybody who loves spicy,asian foo

We are a family of 5 and we had dined at Fatty Weng on several occasions. We were always allocated the round Chinese table that is customary for Chinese dining in the upper floor. However when we dined at Fatty Weng last week, we were instead given square tables on the lower floor that were more suited for western/casual dining. It was not an easy task for the diners to use chopsticks to reach for food that were placed at the other end of the table with and the sitting configuration made conversations extremely difficult.We requested the manager to allocate us to the round Chinese table in the upper floor but she refused our request outrightly and cited that the company policy dictates that the upper floor is only open to diners who spent more than a certain amount of money. The manager was abrupt and not customer centric, and we were highly disappointed with the restaurant that, despite claiming to provide quality Cantonese cuisine, is more concerned with profit maximisation than to respect the culture of Chinese dining
2
Our recent visit left us disappointed with this restaurant. Centrally located in China town the looks de it inviting for us to go in for dinner. Once inside we were seated rice crackers and nuts were placed on the table. Food was ordered and was.quickly bought to us. When we asked for the bill we found that we were charged for the nuts without being advised there was a cost, charged for the napkins that were already on the table as part of the place setting and the final insult was being charged for item "warm water" when one person had asked for a glass of water to drink. No recommendations for this place :(
3
This restaurant is in a very prominent position in Chinatown, at the corner of Smith Street and close to the many food stalls.We stopped for drinks, but, possibly because we were not ordering food, the service was quite abrupt so we did not linger.A pity, as it is in a prime position for people watching.Note: there is 10% service charge and then another 7% tax added on to each item on the bill
5
Absolutely, the best dining experience in Singapore after two trips. The wait staff sat us outside per our request, although the interiors was well lit and comfortably air conditioned. An articulate waiter helped the four of us create a meal that was just right for us without a lot of left overs and took advantage of the locale fare, while creating an entice selection of food.We had the duck wraps (phenomenal), chilli crab (1kilo), local veg and spring rolls, which was enough. Prices were reasonable, figure 50 SGD per person. One of us dropped our chopsticks and the wait staff had a new pair there before we could turn around
5
Last ate in Fatty Wengs 20yrs ago after a review in the daily Telegraph. More upmarket now. Lovely food and great service and good prices.

I travel in Asia all the time and used to live for 18 months in Hong Kong and so I am used to Asian Restaurants and how and what they serve up.I stopped at 'Fatty Weng' for some lunch during a Singapore business trip as I liked the look of the menu and also the dining area was nicely air conditioned and bright and clean looking. It was being used by both locals and tourists which is always a good sign. The staff were smart and polite and as I paid my bill I shock hands with the boss of this restaurant that has been in business since 1967. For my lunch I ordered a 'Minced Chicken and Corn Soup' (SG$6.00) followed by a 'Stir-fried Beef with Ginger and Spring Onions' (SG$13.80) with a side of 'Steamed Rice' (SG$0.80) and a Bottled Mineral Water at SG$2.20. Now these prices are VERY reasonable and I have paid way higher not just in Singapore but also in mainland China... A bowl of steamed rice for GB£0.40 and a very good quality stir-fried beef for GB£6.75 That to me is good value for a sit down lunch in a cool and comfortable restaurant. The reviews that seem to be 'upset' at pricing and saying things like (RIP Off Prices) all seem to be for the seasonal Crab dishes... So my recommendation is: Stick to the pork or beef and you'll be a very happy tourist
4
Many places to eat in Chinatown, but this establishment appeared more appealing due to "nice look" outside and was located on a corner with air-conditioned glass enclosed dinning room. My wife and I split a half Peking Duck. It was delicious and the price was right. Also very nice dinning room upstairs. Clean toilets were also a plus when navigating thru Chinatown. We would definitely go back
2
We made the mistake of venturing into this resturant on our recent visit to Singapore.It looks ok from the outside and wanting to try the local chilli crab dish we were shown a table outside which was good.The busy busslling streets surronding the resturant adds to the ambience and atmosphere but thats when the good feeling ends.This resturant is a tourist trap and exploits it to the max!!!Firstly there is no price for crab...so they basically make it up as they go along.Firstly we were told it was 78 singapore dollars when the bill arrived it had changed to 98 dollars!!The crab was basically all shell with the meat no existant!!!There were locals on the table next to us who paid HALF the price of us...it seems one rule for them and one for tourists.Basically in all the different places we ate in Singapore this was by far the worse!A TOTAL RIP OFF!
2
This is a quaint colonial era restaurant on the corner of Smith St. in the heart of Chinatown in Singapore. I came here with my boyfriend the Sunday after Chinese New Year looking for decent chili crab because it's "the local dish" to try according to my co-workers. The menu didn't list a price for the meal, it just said "Seasonal Price." The place was pretty busy and the service was terribly slow. Eventually a waitress took our order and informed us that the portion was for 2 people. What seemed like an hour after sitting down we were finally served our beautiful large chili crab. It was a messy dish that required cracking the shell and extracting the meat (they brought us forks upon request). We had a side of fried rice, tea, and a beer between us, the grand total (including 10% gratuity built in) was $130!!! Yikes
4
We were just passing so tried! Portions were very good which we were warned about - the waitress warned us that small was enough and she was right!Food arrived in random order but we survived. The lemon chicken was declared to be zesty - it all disappeared? The honey ribs were great and the chicken and ginger very nice.Yes it was a surprise to pay for towels and the total was not low; But seemed typical for Singapore
3
This was our last dinner in Singapore. While I can't say that it was a bad meal, I wouldn't say it was a great. We had the pepper crab. I was surprised that it was on the sweet side. The waitress explained the higher price difference to us that they use a different, bigger (better?) crab than other restaurants nearby. They sell by the pound so our meal was closer to $100 that night, with a side dish of kai lan (chinese broccoli) and drinks. I don't think the crab was cooked that well since we had to try harder getting the meat off the shell. The pincers were huge. As others have stated, we were totally surprised the rice crackers and napkins were charged, esp since they are set on the table as you sit down. No one ever mentions this. (I found that a few restaurants charge for napkins, this isn't the only establishment). While it is really nothing (like 60cents) it is the principle
1
We went with trip advisors average reviews and can see why it's average! Pushy waitresses pointing out expensive items with loud utterly fabricated 'hmmmms' every time you mention anything. You're brought peanuts and a paper napkin which is charged for on your bill! If you've ever had crispy duck, this ain't it. It's a pre cooked duck deep fried in cooking oil. They bring it out on a trolley, demand you take a photo of it, 'hmmmms' all around again before removing the crispy skin ( no meat) and together with 6 microwave steamed pancakes, 4 tiny tiny cucumber sticks and a bit of ginger and hoisin sauce were left to it. The rest of the duck returned later in a different dish which was okay and we had some egg fried rice and one beer. Total bill $67 singapore dollars. Even though service was included, they still demanded a tip. Not good
1
As been stated with other reviews, if you eat here be prepared to pay for everything they bring to the table including the paper hand wipes. When we sat down they asked for our drinks order then brought up a bowl of nuts which we assumed were complimentary followed by our drinks. Shortly after they bought our menus which states that the nuts are not complimentary. The food was ok, and as another review mentioned, the portion sizes were small ( the small option is for 2-3 persons but is in fact a normal size portion for 1). However the attitude of the staff when we queried the bill spoilt any enjoyment of the meal. 10% service charge was added also to the final bill. In this popular district of Chinatown there are dozens of restaurants to choose from and this is one I most certainly will not be retuning to. Forewarned is forearmed
3
Had a meal here lunch time while visiting Chinatown. Felt they were rushing us to order as they were standing over us as we were trying to decide from the menu. When food arrived it was very good and tasty and again I felt they didn't trust us as they seemed to be watching us all the time. Maybe it was just us we must look suspicious or something. Not too badly priced for Singapore
4
Authentic Chinese in chinatown. Great food and affordable...not two things that go together well in Singapore normally
4
Watch out the portions are humongous so one dish feeds 4 easily. If you eat here you risk becoming a "fatty wengker"! That said the food tasted delicious. Just too much of it. Watch out for the complimentary peanuts- they aren't free!
4
Had a few meals in the restaurant, the sweet and sour pork is the best I have ever tasted. Restaurant staff fantastic and helpful.
4
We walked to Chinatown from our hotel as we wanted to experience some authentic, local food. Had a good look around before we ventured into Fatty Weng, primarily because it was a hot evening and it looked nice and cool inside. Staff were extremely attentive and friendly. We had soup to start which was piping hot and delicious. They bring the dishes out as they are ready so the starter and main courses all merged into one which didn't bother us. Main dishes tasty but huge even though we ordered the medium rice which could easily have served 5 people.Didn't think bill was expensive but as per the other reviews, didn't notice that the nuts and towels were charged for; just thought that a nice touch!Gave the impression of good family business
1
As previous reviews watch out for the bill. Napkins and tiny bowl of nuts are not complimentary. Food portions are small and that was after being told to upsize our dishes. Staff where interrupting us to pay the bill whilst we where still eating, fine as they where closing up but to stand and stare almost pressurising us not to read the finer details of the bill was rude beyond believe. How can they charge all these add ons which were not asked for? Better off elsewhere you'll save 60% have better service and won't get fleeced. If you think this place is good then take a look at your bill first
2
This place was recommended as being authentic and reasonably priced. That may be so but we were certainly taken for a couple of mugs. The food was mediocre, luke-warm, unattractive and very unappetising. Service was very slow so I expected the food to be fresh but it wasn't. The rice was awful. I've lived in this part of the world so I know what they can do and this isn't it. There were a group of locals on an adjacent table. Funnily enough they had great food. Large platters of mouth-watering dishes, smelling very appealing. And they were served much more quickly, even though they arrived after us and there were eight of them. Hmm, you wouldn't get away with that in Blighty. Favouritism, methinks! It gets difficult to find anything other than fast food in Singapore nowadays but please cross this one off your list if you are anything but local
5
We decided to dine here on the TA reviews by others. It was tasty, clean and not expensive. We had been seated outside as it was a humid clear evening. Right next to Sim Lim centre it's perfect to have a nice traditional dinner with some great dishes and drinks.
4
Went to Ftty Weng's restaurant on the recommendation of a friend whilst on a visit to Singaporein October. The restaurant is about half way along Smith street in the Chinatown district of Singapore,in a street better known as Food street, the reason being the amount of outdoor takeaway food stalls and shops in this one street, frequented by locals and tourists alike.Fatty weng's is on a corner amidst a crossroad of stalls selling everything under the sun andquite popular from what I'm told especially at night when the street lanterns are lit and the humidity is high as it has air conditioning !The food is a mix of Cantonese , Chinese and Vietnamese styles depending what you fancy.Pork and shrimp dishes are good, chicken less so, reasonably priced given that this is Singapore,but the local beer is called 333 or Tiger beer and icy cold on a sticky evening.Try it and see if you like it
3
I was taken here by a friend, and we chose this place principally for the airconditioning, since it was stifling hot.Peking duck was not bad, but not as good and more expensive than what you get at the Peking Garden restaurant chain in Hong Kong (can't answer for Singapore). Pork and shrimp dishes (Cantonese) were good, but not outstanding. If you are already in the area, this might be a suitable choice, but I wouldn't go out of my way to come here
3
We dived in here as it had air conditioning and cold beer. The menu looked OK too and we expected to pay more than at the open air restaurants nearby. We were brought a small bowl of peanut type snacks, our beer and the menus. Having ordered, we opened the hand wipe towels in their polythene bags. Food came in good time, and then there was the bill: 60 cents for the peanuts, 60 cents each for the hand wipes, and 10% loaded for service charge. We will not return - a bit underhand albeit the sums involved are not huge
3
Read the reviews here and thought we would give it a shot, found the food to be very ordinary and definitely not the cheapest option.
3
Tourist rip off ; I did not check trip advisor before, but did check my bill.. A lot of additional charges ... Ridiculous !
5
We had dinner at Fatty Weng's twice on a recent trip to Singapore! The service was absolutely wonderful! As soon as we walked in the door we had drinks in front of us. Staff even gave my little sister a lesson in how to use chopsticks! The meal was delicious and was value for money. The location was right in the heart of the Chinatown markets; surrounded by street stalls and Chinese lanterns. The staff also remembered us on our second visit which was really nice of them! Catered to all tastes, and satisfied our entire family! Well worth a visit
5
Was surprised by some of the reviews here. I do understand the points about nuts and wipes and we were surprised not to get serviettes but the food was outstanding and well priced.We found no problem in communication. We ordered three dishes and were offered an extra vegetable dish which we needn't have agreed to and also we had two portions of egg fried rice. We had marbled pork in butter sauce, beef with ginger and Sichuan duck.All the food was exceptional and probably the best Chinese food we have eaten. The only oddity for us was the large pieces of dried chilli in the duck dish which were a bit hard and inedible but they were easily left out, don't know if this was an authentic feature.The food came as it was ready which we thought was the usual way in a Chinese restaurant, it didn't come all at once. Hence choosing a variety of dishes to share.The couple at the table next to us ordered one dish each and therefore one had their meal before the other. I don't think ordering a meal each in a Chinese restaurant works and I blame the ignorance of the customer in that instance.We found there was a lot of food (but we managed to finish it off) and we had really left it up to the waiter to advise on quantity as you obviously don't know how big portions are.It was so good we went back the next day when we repeated the marble pork and also had sweet and sour pork and lemon chicken. This time we only had three dishes and asked for one plate of rice for two. The sizes worked better for us this time.As to the comment below about toilets, they were clean and not off the kitchen at all but off a store room cum corridor.Advice to the restaurant? Stop charging extra for the nuts and wipes and include it in your costs. Ask the waiters to make a judgement on portion sizes as the customer does not know how much to order.As for the food, ingredients, cooking, keep up the good work, the quality of the food is certainly not a problem. All the staff were very welcoming and super friendly. Extra plus point, it is inside and air conditioned which was one of the initial attractions
2
Stopped for dinner after strolling around Chinatown. Waiters don't speak any English (being in the very centre of Chinatown I would expect at least English!). We ordered some chicken and mushrooms noodles: DO NOT order large unless it's for 2+ people, stick to smaller portions. While waiting for the (quite good) food they gave us peanuts and wet wipes: NOT COMPLIMENTARY! WE WERE CHARGED FOR SOMETHING WE DIDN'T ASK FOR! This should never happen in any restaurant. Moreover they don't provide napkins, so if you need extra wipes I think you'd be charged for them.Cherry on the cake was the filthy bathroom that you reach through the kitchen. Overall not recommended.
3
Good place for typical Chinese food, good quality, but like to increase dish sizes and this has a two fold affect on price Â£35 per head is a tad expensive in my opinion with no beers. Then again beers in Singapore are a whole different issue
2
Same experience as the last person - the food wasn't bad but the extra charges were unbelievable. There were no serviettes so we used the refresher towel left on the table and were charged for these as well as the small bowel of nuts that were brought to us. Usually if something is placed in front of you on the table before a meal it is complimentry - but no ..... was very disappointed. Can't recommend :
1
This restaurant was a disgrace.... great looking menu which looks nothing like what you get. It was extremely overpriced and very small serves of food. I couldn't believe the final bill included the so called complimentry peanuts that no one ordered for $1 and you also had to pay for your napkins... the food tasty terrible and it deserves this review
2
While deciding on what to order the waiter brought a very small dish of nuts which we didn't order so didn't eat but later discovered had been charged for! We were also provided with two refresh towels (wet wipes) which yes you've guess it we were also charged for!!! Whilst only small charges it's the principle and for that reason we would not return to this restaurant or recommend it
2
Chose Fatty Weng's in Chinatown since they had indoor seating. Service overall was average and attentive. Food was good but portions were small for the price.When we get our bill, we see the restaurant charges you for everything, even the small cup of peanuts they put on the table that you don't ask for. They even charge you for the wet wipe towel they give you. I could have done without both of those so don't just charge me for them. Will not go back, and do not recommend for the simple reason that they nickel and dime unsuspecting tourists
3
This corner restaurant is really nothing special. Service was okish, food was okish and location was okish. It won't hurt to go, but there's no reason to recommend it either.
5
Fatty Weng Restaurant has moved to 37 Smith Street #01-01 & 02-01 S58950. No longer at Guillemard road.
5
Very popular restaurant. The food was delicious and my kids loved all of it...even the vegetable dishes! But they especially loved the pork ribs which is apparently a Fatty Weng favourite.
4
Had a meal here as it looked a bit cleaner and more comfortable than many of the places in Chinatown. Food was pretty good service was quick and including a bottle of wine it was under £50 for two which was fair
5
On Thursday 19th August my husband and I experienced our first meal of Peking Duck at Fatty Weng's restaurant in China Town. Fortunately we were with a couple of locals who knew exactly what and how to order.The duck had its skin expertly cut off in front of us and placed in a bowl. The rest of the meat was returned to us in another bowl mixed with their home made black bean sauce. First you place a small thin crepe on your plate, with a piece of shallot and a piece of cucumber, then put some special sauce, similar to plum sauce on it, then roll it up and eat it. It is simply delicious! The cost was only $49 for two of us which was unbelievable! We also had a dish of chicken and cashew, Chinese cabbage accompanied with fried rice. I opted to use a fork but the other three used their chop sticks. It was good that the choice was given.We also had Chinese tea which went well with the meal.Now, if anyone suggests Peking Duck I will know exactly how to eat it, which, I find is always reassuring
4
Had a fabulous late lunch at Fatty Wengs. It was a warm day and it was nice to get in to an airconditioned restaurant but the food was such a surprise. Service was very good and we didnt have to wait too long for what turned out to be a memorable meal. Great egg fried rice, and I am not usually a rice eater, and the prawns we had were so succulent and flavoursome my mouth is salivating now. All the places along the Food Street looked good but we are glad we went in to Fatty Wengs. Would recommend
4
We ate inside as it was very hot and humid outside and the aircon was very efficient inside the restaurant. Food was very good quality and service was good as well.There was a cover charge and service was added as well so could be a bit pricey, we only had china tea to drink which kept the cost down a bit. Its very central in Chinatown so you have some stalls etc to wander round if you want to make an evening of it
4
Ate here with my wife and 4yo daughter. We ordered a few dishes, the signature honey pork dish, fried noodles, fried rice, spring rolls etc. plus drinks for a total of about $70 sgd. Staff were very friendly. Food was delicious and filling, we probably ordered too much. We were a bit shocked and disappointed to see a charge for the nuts and wet towels given to us though. Never been charged for these things before and feels a bit stingy. They should either notify the customers there is a charge or absorb the cost
3
We were exhausted with the heat in Singapore so we stepped in for air-con. restaurant .the duck was delicous , best perking duck I ever tasted .the mistake was .... the owner recomment the signature fish dish from her restaurant , it was a large dish for 2 persons and tastedless .!!!Thai coconut was cold sweet and nice for a hot day service was okeverything was charge , from napkin to small plate of nut , we thought it was a compliment from the restaurant .We will try other restaurant next time We are in Singpapor
2
Terribly over priced, and left feeling like we were manipulated as tourist--over $88 sgd for 1/2 Peking Duck and 2 Tiger beers. The dish was well prepare, but did not include anything but the duck and pancake rolls!! we were charged over $25 for a side of egg fried rice plus a small plate of mix veggies. Also, charged for nuts on table and wet napkins...yikes, we feel like we fell into a horrible tourist trap--despite all the other options. Please be clear with customers with menu, and what is being up charged. Will not return, nor recommend
5
Had lunch here was hungover and the solids here helped to repair me...beef with ginger and chicken dumplings with noodles were very pleasing.
4
Excellent tucker and service, Great menu choices - wine extremely expensive but. Nice alfresco setting, and aircon area. The restaurant is within walking distance from anywhere in CBD. We'll be back.
Cheers Niels and Mary, Humpty Doo, Australia, Down under

A portion of noodles with some (little) meat and a couple of prawns for S$15, and they even charge for the peanuts they put on your table without asking (and you start eating them). Avoid.
4
If you've tried the beef kway teow at Lorong 9 and think it's good, come and try this dish here and you will forever return to Fatty Weng's. I usually takeaway here.
4
We stopped into Fatty Weng for lunch while exploring China Town. The airconditioned interior was particularly appealing! Peking duck for two ($35) was great value with first course served as duck pancakes and the second course cooked as your choice of four dishes. We chose the ginger and spring onion option which was delicious. All up, including a drink each, we paid around SGD $55 which we thought was pretty good value despite the fact what we thought were complimentary nuts were charged at $1 and the face refreshing washers on the tables were 60c each
4
Ate here twice on recent trip to Singapore, wish we gone here first as we would have come back every evening.The staff here are very good, the choice on menu excellent, the prices very good for Singapore, if you want to eat in an air conditioned restaurant, do not pass this one by
2
Looked busy during the day, so called in for dinner. Food was good, their signature honey BBQ pork ribs were awesome, but the service was so bad and rude that it spoilt the night. They were more interested in closing on time than looking after clients. $80 dinner for two in Chinatown is over the top too! Had better meals and service in the hawker centres
4
Compared to other places in Singapore with the exception of the hawker centers this was very reasonable for the food and portions we got. The duck noodles were fabulous and the fried rice was some of the best I've had. I also had the Nonya shrimp - which is a type of paranakan food unique to Singapore - spicy and flavorful. Took a local there and she loved it
1
Was at the newly opened branch at Smith Street Chinatown. It was an experience to forget - an absolutely horrid meal.The fish maw soup tasted like salt water, tasteless just salty at $8 per individual bowl.Bean sprout with shredded duck meat appeared like they were soaked in oil overnight. Tasted ok but extremely oily.Home made tofu was small in serving but tasted very bland.Roasted chicken was forgettable too.Service was poor and staff ill trained.Not likely to return again

Went to this small little restaurant on Guillemard Road for a few times these month. Quite an okay restaurant with no air-conditioned seats. Being seated quite near a small drain is quite a torture at times as you may get to smell the stench coming from the drain near the seats if you get unlucky so i usually take away food from this restaurant and most of them are packed in a yellow banana leaf which makes it better. The food here is great! the price is also not expensive for a zhi char restaurant so it's quite worth the money and worth the time coming down here. its not crowded at sometimes but i came here during the weekends and it was quite crowded. I need not to wait long for my takeaway to come to me even though there was quite a lot of people here at that time

Came with my friends for dinner.. Quite good.. A family friend told me about the place.. Quite easy to find. Not too crowded as well..Will visit again in future..

This is a cute local joint which serves up hot tasty dishes at a great price. The morning glory vegetables were delicious, as was the fried pork and steamed fish. Don't come here for atmosphere or sophistication... But good honest food!

Food came quick, service was good, food was really hot when it arrived. The service was quietly in the background as we visited with our friends. Price seemed pretty reasonable (S$ 150 for 8 persons and we were full when we left).

Food is tasty, but seating area along the drain, too dirty for my standard.

My family came back to Singapore after our trip in Malaysia, it was my daughter's birthday and I decided to bring them here since I know they will like the food. It was great that everybody loved it. We ordered fried rice, fried tofu, buttered crab, sweet and sour pork, crispy noodles and vegetables. It was a hit! It was pricey but mainly because of the crab that was around $42 a piece. The only issue was, it was along the road and beside a drain so it smells, with cockroaches going around your tables and the worst was the toilet that you will have to see the how dirty the inside of their store looks like. But overall, the food was great
