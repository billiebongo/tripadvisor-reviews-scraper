cheaper than anyone else, 800grams good for 2 pax for only $50+ we love it and its yummy. i thought it will be hard to find the place but it's not :)
5
All dishes ordered exceeded our expectations and the price point was reasonable. A tip to would be patrons: check the menu out before your visit as there are certain items you have to pre-order.
3
Its my first visit back since the move.
They used to use good glasses for wines, now its the cheap sort.
Everything else was status quo.
5
Must try the US black angus ribeye steak, tastes very juicy and tender. Comes with a plate of rice that soaks in the flovour left behind by the steak.
4
Beautifully steamed fish. Served deboned. Have eaten several times here and their previous locations. So it is good enougt for us to keep following them around.
Strange location but thats part of its charm.
We also usually bring our own wine which is another plus.

Firstly, you need to go here in a large group to get the full benefit of their extensive menu. some of the group sets provide amazing value. Next, if you are looking for ambiance and atmosphere, this place is not for you. It;s located near a storied car park and the decor is almost reminiscent of coffee shops of SG - lots of plastic chairs and tables and lots of people buzzing.With that in mind, lets talk about the food. For me, I now the a new favorite for Black pepper crtab and Crab bee hoon!! They are amazing - the crabs are full of roe which are mixed profusely with the thick paste of black pepper (generous abundance of the sauce unlike some of the other established crab restaurants where the sauce quantity is getting less and less everyday) and the bee hoon is saturated with the thick soup and roe. The crabs themselves are very fresh and of good size.The other seafoods (prawn, clams, razor clams) are all very fresh and delicious as well.Next, the most surprising item on the list - USDA prime ribeye beef steak!!! you really don't expect this, but it's true. the portion is HUGE (500-600 gms without trimmings), so again - you need a group of beef lovers! the taste is genuine USDA prime and it's beautifully char grilled to the doneness of your liking. They make a fried rice (called Heart Attack rice) from the fat trimmings of the steak after melting it, but frankly, while inventive, it was not too my liking - the taste was weird and I found it a bit bitter. But, it's included in the price so you dont have to think much about it.In summary, one of the best places - taste wise, wallet wise to go with groups and hog out on seafood and streak.Revisit likelihood - as soon as I get my friends together
3
They have a young millineal crew BUT attitude sucks. No courtesy and I have to keep saying please and thank you, sarcastically with the hope the crew got it but hey no it did not happen. The seam squid was miserable - came in 2 large double oval plates place one on top of the other but 3 medium size squid cut into small pieces. The mee goreng this time round was laden with oil - super oily that the dish was hardly touched.
5
Located on the car park floor of an industrial building in a quiet residential area; an unassuming venue which belies the quality of the fare on offer. Tastiness is matched by the generous spread of dishes available, which includes both popular local delights and Western favourites. The steak and fried rice combo far exceeded expectations, and the pork and seafood choices were a good match for what you get at fancier establishments. Excellent value for money as well, considering the amount ordered.
4
Mind the location and layout the food taste good and worth its value! It serves not only seafood but great ribeye steaks, ribs, lamb racks, cheese board, banana flambÃ© and others! Its yummy! Their Hokkien mie, mie goreng and fried sotong are great tasting. It has many more choices and a great place to relax and hangout at a reasonable price. Location is a warehouse complex on the mezzanine floor. Take the ramp up to park. Its at the Lam Soon Warehouse center at Hillview. Heard they are opening a branch at CHIMJES soon
4
The Black Angus Rib Eye Beef was grilled to the right tenderness. We ordered 2 types of crabs - Chili and Garlic Bake. The gravy to the Chili crab was so good my son asked to pack the remaining home. For those garlic lovers, garlics were generously used for the garlic bake crab which gives out a nice fragrant. Crabs used were very fresh.
1
Foods served are generally great. However the services provided was not up to the standard. Have to think twice whether to dine again.
5
Most of the dishes we ordered are v tasty and unique.
Prices were on the high side compared to cze char but still much affordable compared to restaurants.
4
Local food with a twist. Western ingredients fused with local dishes. Interesting place to bring tourists for a different experience
4
Must order the US beef cooks in medium raw. Perfect taste for the price paid. The 800g crab is extremely fresh and exceed my expectation. Portion is Super big too.
4
dishes were served really fast. often come here for birthday celebrations with the family and the steak is really my favourite dish!
5
We went to New Ubin as one of my friends recommended the place. We ordered the wagyu beef and fried rice, steamed squid, fried kailan and salted-egg prawns. The beef was melt-in-your-mouth yummy and done just nice, and the fried rice (which is an accompanying dish when you order the beef) was really yummy! The steamed squid looked like a simple dish (soya sauce & garlic steamed squid), but tasted heavenly! We really enjoyed all the dishes we ordered and we ate every up - one of my friend even ordered extra steam rice so that she can finish up the steam squid sauce
2
New Ubin Seafood is not unfamiliar to all of us who dined on 25th Jan. Although we are not frequent patrons, we have had good experience at the restaurant together or separately in different occasions. We are just a bunch of foodies who gather for a meal once in a while.At this visit, food and service standard dropped. The Garlic crab was not flavourful, the beef was not as tender and the fried rice was harder than before. The only saving grace was the fish, it tasted fresh! We had two other uneventful dishes - so so, can't say good or bad.Staff serving our table was certainly not as knowledgeable as before; and wasn't clear explaining the food or dessert. We wanted a single person portion dessert but the staff understood it to be for the group to share and delivered so. Rather odd experience.This could be a one-off. We'll probably go back again, but not anytime soon. Not the most attractive place for 6 pax to spend $500+ and maybe get a good meal
3
Was excited to get my mud crab fix while recently at Singapore. One of my colleagues recommended this place (I would usually go to No Signboard Seafood for mud crab) but had never been to New Ubin before, so was excited to try.As there was 5 of us, we opted for the signature set menu, man is that a lot of food! From Foie Gras to Fried chicken to Steak and Fried rice, all this before the crab! The crab did come out, we opted for one chili crab, and one salted egg. I have never had salted egg crab before and was not a fan. The chili crab was "OK", but feel it is better at No Signboard. We were able to order huge Asahi beer bowls with tap things, they were neat! And this is a fun place to go with big crowds, for lost of rich food, really good value for what you get.So, all in all a good place with good food, just prefer other crab places
5
The food was amazing. We've been living in Singapore for almost 2 years now. We visited so many local restaurants, but always felt the food was somewhat bland until we visited this restaurant. Everything we ordered was so good.The place is very popular with the locals. We were the only non Singaporeans in the restaurant. It was so nice to see how really Singaporeans eat and live. We will be back
4
As recommed by my sister, we have lunch at this restaurant. Most of the foods we ordered such as the beef steak, chili crab and salted egg crab, prawn rolls, bee hoon and pork belly was so yummy. The service was very fast and the waitress were quite friendly. Would surely recommend this restaurants to friends and family
5
The food was excellent and the portion sizes were generous, it does have a slightly odd location, but this was of no matter once we were seated. I would highly recommend eating here.
5
I will like to visit it again soon, great place for meeting up with friends. Enjoyable dining with them
4
Visited the new place after it moved to Hillview. Place is still retaining its old world charm. Will come again soon
1
This was one of our favourites when it was at Sim Ming. This is our first visit to the Hill View location. Complete disappointment. Fine dining prices, but hawker centre experience.
2
Was there for colleagues farewell... environment not so good and the foods are so so only.... not value for money
4
The services provided exceeded my expectations. Staff are helpful and spontaneous. Food is good but slightly pricey.
4
Other than the location is a little bit far for us, overall experience is pleasant. Service was good and I highly recommend garlic baked lobster!!
5
We are fans of this place and have often visited their restaurant in sin Ming drive before they moved to their new location. We drove quite a distance and you should note that the restaurant is not immediately visible from the industrial building facade - it's on the 2nd floor. (Look for a neon lit crab sign) The food turns out to be really the same old, reliable and incredibly tasty dishes that got us hooked on them in the first place. Their new location is also larger, but features the same ocean blue ceiling top, and also the olden days plastic chairs that I find endearing. Great place for a family lunch out!
4
I was taken here by friends who live in Singapore. I wouldn't have found it by myself, up on the 6th floor of a multi-storey car park in an industrial estate.But I'm glad I did. It is a busy, bustling, authentic-feeling restaurant that doesn't stand on ceremony, but serves tasty dishes at reasonable prices.When I visited, every table was occupied and there was a real buzz about the place. And I felt I had discovered some secret local hangout.Well worth a visit
4
We had dined several times at the Sin Ming premises, but this was our first visit here.They seem to have replicated the aircon room here as well, and some of the staff like Poon are here too.We had some guests in town and they wanted to visit as they had heard about the place. We ordered the usual dishes, such as pork and chicken satay, which were still very good. The crispy baby squid was also nice and crunchy. The Angus beef was a popular dish, while the fried rice was flavoured with the beef drippings.The signature hokkien mee was not as good, though, and the stock was rather bland.It is located on the 6th floor of an industrial building. We suggest you use the passenger lifts, or drive up to the floor. We parked near the gate and used the goods lift, but these lifts were locked down when we left
4
1.7kg Grouper Fish was fresh and ideally steam. Overall the food and service by Ann and Darren was wonderful. Ann is always around to serve your needs and Darren recommend the fresh catch for the day. What need improvement is restroom outlook and facilities.
4
Good service and resonably good food. Very good variety of food served for all. However, disappointed with the chilli crab as the meat was not "solid" enough.
5
Good food as usual. The casual environment and food make an easy last minute choice with friends and family. Even though reservation is always recommended. Later slots are usually available.
3
wanted to treat my family a good dinner and birthday celebrate and the foods really down....especially the crab...:(
5
This restaurant has one of the Best Food in Singapore!
A Must Try and will visit again!! I have feasted 3 times in a year.
5
Their US Black Angus Ribeye with fried rice never fails whether you have it at the restaurant or have it pre-ordered and delivered. Also delicious was the NZ Lamb Rack and Hong Kong Kailan Special.
4
I've been here for years and following them since there moves. Consistently good. Favorite dishes is the prawn rolls (Hei Chor), Singapore Chilli crab, Fried prawn paste chicken wings (Har Cheong Kai), Baked garlic crab, the beef steak with beef fat fried rice. These are just our usual order. We also tried their fish with signature Cin Chaluk sauce..... Amazing! Staff recommendation on what is fresh / good for the day is fantastic. A must visit when you are in Singapore. The restaurant location is not that central, but getting a taxi/uber is easy enough to get through anywhere
1
Food was over priced, staff did not know the actual size of the food, asked him how big the $14 luncheon meat fried rice was, he told us it is for 2-3 people, turns out it is only for 1 person. Please don't order that unless you're feeling rich or whatsoever. Prawn paste chicken was $15 for 8 pieces, whot???? you can clearly get that many pieces for $8 at other zi char places and it would taste the same or even nicer. Definitely not worth coming, but if you're feeling rich and want to spend some money, this is the place to go.

I heard good things about New Ubin Seafood but the overall experience was lacking. To begin with, the interior designer was either blind or used things they found in a dusty attic somewhere to decorate the place. The staff were clearly untrained; they came across as brusque (but not rude) and required multiple reminders for cutlery and drinks. The menu was an annoyingly disorganised mess in the same vein as the interior. [New Ubin Seafood I will redesign your menu for free if you like] The food came very quickly and ranged from ok (salted egg soft shell crab and garlic sweet potato leaves) to pretty good (boss bee hoon), but were largely unmemorable. The prices were on the high side - $160 for 5 people. I left not understanding the hype
4
First of all; I made reservation 2 nights ago based on the Handy Hotel Room review & Online review including a mention in the Michelin Guide. Couldn’t get one earlier. We arrive there by Uber; it’s an industrial building our driver not sure if the address is right! So we get out; take the elevator to the 6 floor where we find a parking! We walk to the back of the parking to find a restaurant in the parking! The food was good; if you never had North American Red Meat before I can understand why everyone loves this place. We had a great dinner. I did find it a bit expensive considering the location (parking garage) & the service wasn’t on par!
5
Great food and setting for a dinner gathering with friends.
The beef steak is a must try!
Remember to book in advance.
5
Overall experience is great. Cozy and quiet place within industrial area. Food and service are great. Reservation is straight forward. No problem with parking. Lastly, BYOB!
4
Excellent quality beef and fish head steamboat. Beef was tender and juicy. Fish head steamboat was so delicious and full of quality ingredients. Prices are a little steep but worth the quality of food. Excellent place for lunch event with the family.
5
Great food and superb service. Had the vadai which was a new addition and it was awesome. Goes well with whiskey of which there is a fine selection available.
1
Food is good and price higher than average. However, the supervisor staff is not up the mark. We ordered 2 additional dishes after our order came. The first addition of fried vegetables came 20 minutes later which was fine. But after another 15 minutes our Mee Goreng still have not arrived. We enquired and they told us it was mistakenly delivered to another table and they will prepare a fresh one immediately. After another 15 minutes, they brought out a dish of Hokkien Noodles (which we did not order) instead of the Mee Goreng. We asked the waiter and his supervisor what happened and they said they made another mistake and will attend to it. He sent the waiter back to the kitchen to fix it.The supervisor kept coming back to our table to give us one reason after another instead of going into the kitchen to make sure the order was right.
5
Had a gathering here for 8pax, and we probably over ordered: 1) 2 x standard portions of Boss Beehoon2) 1 x large hokkien mee3) 600g of medium rare waygu with side of heart attack fried rice4) Fried kailan 5) sambal petai prawns6) prawn paste chicken7) onion egg8) beerwe were stuffed but happ

Have heard many good things about new ubin seafood and I’m glad it didn’t disappoint.Food was served quite promptly and I felt that the quality of food was really value for money. In particular, I really enjoyed the salted egg squid, satay was fabulous, har cheong gai and fish with some spicy sauce and petaii. My family also liked that the spinach with three eggs was not too starchy like other tze char places. The crab was okay but the sauce that came with our chili crabs was really nice. Having said that, the only dish that was probably a bit more meh for us was the hokkein mee. Our servers were all quite knowledgeable and recommended the right portions and right stuff. Loved the whole tze char vibe at new ubin and will surely return again
4
Been here a couple of times this year, reservation was honoured promptly when we arrived. Food was good, but they ran out of larger crabs, we should have pre ordered a day before. Staff was attentive, she provided an ice bucket for the white wine and got us wine glasses.
5
Situated at the top of an industrial parking lot, the casual canteen feel to the restaurant made it more fun. The beer tower also helped! For the overseas travelers, book the AC room. We enjoyed the Singapore Chilli Crab with fried/steamed Man Tou, Ribeye steak with the "heart attack" fried rice stir fried in the beef drippings, Fried egg roe, and crispy eggplant. Enjoyed chatting with owner. You must also save room for 2 dessert items - durian creme brulee and the gula melaka fried bananas with coconut ice cream. We'll be back at some point to try their other dishes
3
For the pricing that the restaurant is charging, the food is considered as average. Kudos to owners for putting in the effort to get feedback from customers but it’s rather redundant given the time lag in between feedback given and next follow up which could be 2-3 weeks later. However, the beef steak is still excellent during lunch hours. Avoid eating it during dinner or when the place is fully packed. That’s when the steak has either no taste and over cooked. There used to be economical sets which are rather value for money. The sets have been changed at least twice within the year and unsuspecting repeat customer will just order and realized later that there’s food shortage or limited drink flow. Service here is good though. Come here just for beef and eat elsewhere for other food. There’s limited aircon seating area and you’ll probably be seated outside with no aircon and charged at aircon restaurant pricing
4
ordered Chilli crab, bbq pork ribs, satay, mee goreng, fried rice.
Chilli crab was average. Highlight was pork rib and mee goreng.
4
3 of us, the bill came up to $133. We had ordered a 800g chilli crab. Otherwise the food is generally good but the portions are really small.
4
Majority of the dishes we tried is nice but price is slightly high. Very convenient for people who drive there, as restaurant is located at the carpark.
3
Food was good but prices are on the high side especially for the beef.
The restaurant ambience could do with a major makeover. Not well-lit, floor was dirty and table looks old and worn out.
3
Heard a lot about it but was disappointing. Some dishes were pretty good but others so so but expensive for the price and setting.
5
One of my favourite restaurants in Singapore.
Always something new and wonderful to try....
Steak USA and Crab are always sensational....mouth watering.
Interesting journey to get to the restaurant but always worth the effort.
Highly Recommended.
5
This place is now one of our favourite eating places. Service is good and the dishes are served very promptly. We could not resist ordering the salted egg crab again. I still prefer the black pepper crab to the white pepper crab. The pork ribs were tender and juicy. My favourite was the small crispy squid you’ll love the sweetness and crunch. Come early around 6.30pm to beat the dinner crowd.

1. The setting is not exactly new. (It’s in an al fresco canteen in a multistory car park of an industrial building)2. There’s much more than seafood on the menu. (Beef is one of their signature dishes)3. It’s nowhere near the sea. (It’s right in the middle of Singapore).That said, we had a great time. Portions were huge, service was very friendly and the angus beef cubes, heart attack fried rice (!) and crab beehoon were heavenly. Just thinking about this makes my mouth water
2
I went to Ubin Seafood with my colleagues for a Christmas celebration. One of my colleague is a vegetarian and we tried to order a personal portions of noodles or rice without egg. The waiter was very rigid and said any noodles or rice without egg will not taste good. When we ask for suggestions, he recommended Mee Goreng. We asked if the "Mee" can be changed to "Beehoon" - his response was, "No, the chef has never cooked this way before". Then we asked for another recommendation, he said fried rice. When we ordered that, another waitress came to us and again, mentioned that if it is without egg, it will not taste good. We understand that they want to maintain their quality of food, but this rigidness, is ridiculous. Any other Cze cha stalls are able to do a main without egg, I don't understand why can't Ubin Seafood. We have been to their outlet in Sin Ming before they moved to Hillview and they made vegetarian noodles for my colleague. Was it a change of Chef or just that the waiter is not willing to give in?
4
I guess this is not your typical tze char food, but the price is indeed pretty reasonable for the type and quality of food we got. However, we have one gripe with the serving portions. We went as a group of 5, ordered the set meant for 4-6 and yet we were only given four portions of foie gras. was a hunger games moment. other than that, we don't have any complaints and we're glad that we were seated in the air conditioned area on a hot day.
3
Hawker center standard food with premium pricing. This could be a result of good quality ingredients but taste was nothing to shout out for. Service was prompt and pretty decent.
4
The food was good, didn't expect much due to it's location and the amount of people there. Staff were nice too! This restaurant deserves more credit :)
5
Standard of food is great. The beef never fails to put a smile on my face. Always make a booking first to avoid disappointment.
4
Service was rather erratic but the std of food was consistently high compared to the last time we were here.
5
New Ubin Seafood Restaurant is tucked away from the usual buzz of Singapore and it serves great food! Would definitely go back more times.
5
Awesome chill place for big group catchups(: had the 10-person set and everyone left with happy tummies(:
4
Had a dinner with family and made a reservation thru CHOPE. Reservation was fast and easy.Dinner was good with generous serving of food, Jason was helping us with the order, and he was a helpful chap recommending us the dishes. Nice experience at the Restaurant
5
We visited this restaurant with a group of friends; it was a truly memorable dining experience. We enjoyed the friendly atmosphere and service; however this was not about the service and/or the ambience, food was the real star of the show. The meat platter was delicious with the beef in particular being impressive: top quality and cooked to perfection. The medley of Sri Lankan crabs was delightful too: beautifully fresh and flavoursome. Everything was fresh and cooked beautifully; we really felt that this place does its best to serve high quality food at affordable prices. Book in advance to avoid disappointment: the place was heaving with punters and we enjoyed the merry atmosphere. The place operates a "bring your own" alcohol policy - and the corkage is free. So don't forget to take with you a couple of nice white wines to go with the delicious sea food. Or whatever takes your fancy. Enjoy
2
You would find too many expat dinners here with the canteen like premises.That chilli crab (500gm) will cost you $50 at least per crab with very little meat. We had the salty egg crab and it was unlikely fresh crab s the meat was soft as opposed to firm.It s never eat to eat crabs these thanks to choice crabs exported to China as with musang king durians .Too much hype about the food n crabs here. Not worth the trouble to come all the way here
5
You need to make a reservation to ensure you have a table. I loved the food here and I recommend the sotong fried with salted egg, the beef steak, fried chicken wings and the dessert is worth a try. The black pulut with coconut ice cream, though the pulut is not sweet at all, the ice cream is. Do refer to the photos I took of the dis
5
Love the garlic baked crab and beef. Simply delicious. Was surprised we were given indoor seating with aircon. Made our dining very comfortable.
4
Nice garlic crab, affordable price.
Fast service.
Great steak and hokkien noodles.
No aircon though.
4
My second visit since they moved to the west. Ample parking, quick service and excellent food! Love their fried rice with beef dripping!
4
The food was excellent.
The service can be improved, with the staff being more attentive.
Will for sure go back for more.
4
Makes you feel at home with the food that reminds you of yester year! Staffs are customer oriented and makes your dining experience a memorable one!
4
Attentive & prompt service. Food is not bad, extremely crowded for a rather remote place. Very casual place and great place for big group gathering. Though do take note that they are strict on keeping within 2 hours eating times...
3
The steak came cold, 2 small unflavourful crabs. I think the menu is overpriced. Could’ve gotten better food at some random neighborhood zichar. The service slightly made up for it
5
every single dish were amazing!!! the flavour, the freshness of food, and especially the cooking! weâ€™re late for the table as we got a bit lost, but they managed to sit us down in 10min and service was super friendly! we left in food coma :
4
Venue was very secluded but it gave off the kampung vibes with the decoration in the restaurant. Food was pretty yummy esp the mee goreng and the beehoon and chilli crab.The mantou was not tasty and it cost 1 dollar per mantou - skip that if you can.Overall good dining experience with speedy service despite the restaurant being very crowded
4
BYOB no corkage. Decent pricing as this is a low cost environment. Outdoor sitting was cool and well ventilated (November season). Best to make reservations direct with restaurant. Booking platform Chope is preferred, as Quandoo does not show real availability. Lots of options on the menu, the sets are a good way to get started. I like almost everything we had: satay ok, hokkien mee was good, beef, kailan, salted egg soft shell crab, prawn paste chicken wings was very savoury, calamansi lime juice to my liking, the dessert was french loaf with butter and kaya - surprisingly good despite being stuffed at the end of the night. Kaya was fragrant and not too sweet. Too busy eating, and forgot to take pictures..
3
1st visit is in Sep17. All is very impressed with quality and value.
Decided to go again in Nov17. Wow ... a total let down I must say.
4
If you are looking for a clean environment to dine... This is really not the place. Food... not bad. Surrounding smell... my goodness, where do i start? Very pricey for hawker food though...
5
2nd time to the restaurant but 1st time to their new location.
Food as usual impressed the guests! Weekends are usually packed so if u want to have good conversations...sit outdoors-its not so warm!
5
Great choice for a meal with friends to celebrate a birthday - great food, free corkage, what's not to like?
5
New Ubin is famous for its interesting combination of local food and western cuisine. The nostalgic "canteen" environment gives us the most unique experience~
4
Yummy and fresh - garlic baked crab, also try beef which come with complementary fried rice/wedges and special hokkien mee. like or check in FB page which you will get one free drink each
3
We booked for 830pm session but table was not ready until after 9pm. This would not have been so bad except that the restaurant wanted to chase us out at 1030!
4
Decide to try this place after hearing much about it. Was there on a weekday night, still quite packed with people, but no que, glad we made a booking ahead.We had a steam crab and a baked garlic crab. Both was good, however I had fresher crabs before.We also had the Sambal Petai, the sauce is our favourite! We used it as a dipping sauce for almost everything. I also personally liked the atmosphere of this place
3
The service needs improvement. We were being shown to the table but no one provides us with the menu. I had to walk up to the server desk to pick up the menu. The waiter was not familiar with the set menu. Food was generally good but the portion of the appetizer that we ordered was a bit shocking. They served only one salted egg soft shell crab to a table of five people. Is soft shell crab that expensive? I really wonder... Maybe it is the top grade soft shell crab.
3
Marketing as a tze char and a non-aircon canteen set up price, the price we pay is too high. The crab size at $45 for one is below my expectation. The texture of the crab is soft not firm. A small bottle of 330ml beer costs $8 is surprisingly hig
5
Staff were prompt in responding to requests prior to our reservation date (able to communicate using iMessage was a bonus) and also provided excellent service during dinner.
Must try dishes - Angus Ribeye (MR) and Chin-chalok Soon Hock.
5
Put in request on chope to get indoor seating and to order the rib eye in advance and request was granted. Really loved all the dishes, great experience
5
Food was really delicious...esp the steak and boss bee Hoon. Good value, although the place is around Upper Bukit Timah.
3
The restaurant is too stuffy and hot as the ventilation is not enough for such a large crowd of people.
5
Service was good.
The location is quite remote, but that adds to the ambience and novelty of the area. With the opening of the Downtown Line, it is more accessible than before.
4
Salted egg sotong dish was too watery and jelak (aka too rich). It would be better if the sotong was fried first then lightly coated with the salted egg .
5
My friends and I had to return to New Ubin seafood after barely 2 weeks. We had fallen in love with of the crabs. The Sri Lankan salted egg crab and black pepper crab were superb. The Hokkien Mee special had plenty of gravy and slices of pork. The pork knuckle was reasonably priced. The menu offered other seafood and Western items too. A great place to bring family and friends both local and overseas. It is a popular place so it is wise to make reservations to avoid disappointment.
5
So this place is a lot of fun and has one of the most extensive menus that I've ever seen. If you intend on going, then do some homework on what tickles your fancy.I recommend:1. The US black Angus steak2. Fish with sambal and petai3. Baked garlic crab4. Pork jowl satayThere's airconditioned rooms if you book beforehand. Also, could corkage is free
4
We came with some guests from out of town to New Ubin Seafood for a different experience. Some of our local friends recommended New Ubin Seafood. We visited on a Sunday night. The location is definitely unconventional - level 6 of a commercial type building just off the car park in a less conventional area (but free parking)! Some tables are open air but there are some tables inside with air conditioning. We ate garlic crab, bee hoon, Kai Lan, soon hock risk, seafood hor fun, fried rice, and pork satay as well as the red bean pancake. The fish and crab were very fresh. The hor fun was not as good as I expected. The red bean pancake was crispy, not too oily and not too sweet. Go for a more local experience (ignoring the decor). Good value meal
5
My friend and i were quite late to our reservation and their staff called us to check and informed us of the last order so we ordered immediately when arrived.The food arrived very very fast and we are able to eat leisurely with no pressure to turn in the table since we were the last of the last customers
2
With so many friends raving about this place, I was rather disappointed when I finally visited. Food is ok only, portions too small and expensive. Definitely not value for money. Will not visit again given that the food is not particularly anything to rave about.
5
Good fusion food. Service was okay, food is slightly pricey but every dish is well-made! Had a great time w my family.
1
Is not value for money. They charge 5 Stars pricing in industry canteen. With that pricing you can easily go to any 5 Stars hotel restaurant for dinner.
4
Roast beef was excellent as usual. Fried oyster as good. Chili crab was so so and gravy lacked flavor.
4
Staff was curteous and prompt in their service. Quality of food is good but somehow a tad below quality for dinner (I had dinner on 3 occasions previously).

We order XL Crab with more than 1kg, it was served in a very big plate for 3 of us only. Chili crab was nice but we feel it's a bit too much gravy. Potato leaves and squid was nicely stir fried. It's a good place for gathering and it's my 2nd visit. Price is a little pricey at that kampung style environment :)

This resto keeps moving for some reason. Finally decided to make a booking (better book early). Must try at this place are their US black angus rib eye which comes with the ‘Heart attack’ fried rice, probably fried under the bbq with the juice and charred fatty of the beef. Also their Garlic baked Sri Lankan crab and salted egg yolk soft shell crab, so good that the place worth a visit despite its unorthodox location. Good to know that Michelin recognise this place and awarded the Michelin Bib Gourmand in 2017. Note: we were only 2 adults and 2 kids thus we should have ordered smaller beef portion. We didn’t mention this, so we had 600gr and since we wanted to try a number of dishes we ordered too many. We spent around $229 (10% service charge and 7% GST inclusive).Summary: overall we are happy with our decision to come to this place
3
The place is quite ulu and tough to find. Inconvenient location unlike previous premises. The atmosphere is average and layout of the floor space is no good. The food tastes average and overprice. Not worth the value. It was my 2nd visit but would be the last one as well unless they improve their food, atmosphere and location.

Had a family dinner last Sunday. The good - reservation system. Is great. Reminders to reconfirm a couple of days before. Really convenient and easy. The food - set meal was good value with foie gras, crabs done two styles and Angus beef. Thing is the beef was served like warm rather than sizzling hot. Not as good as my last experience. The service - two really good servers but otherwise lackadaisical attitude throughout. Expected better. Overall, ok experience. Might be back but room to improve
4
It was our first visit since they moved to Hillview . Making reservations via Chope is so much easier . We ordered our usual Favourite dishes n we love them esp the Angus beef n the fried rice . The portion for the rest of the dishes was also very generous. Will definitely visit the restaurant again and also recommend friends to dine there too.
5
The place is not new to me. I’ve been there several times since it was situated in Sin Ming. Always good food. Just too many choices for just two people to try them all.
Love that the corkage is waived.
5
good price for the big crab not the small crab, the difference only $10 from small to big crab ,
the fried noodle and fried rices is the best
4
A refreshing spin on the traditional zichar. Service was attentive and relaxed. Food portioning was average but quality is good.
5
We enjoyed the great food and good service rendered by the staff. As usual, the beef was done to perfection.
3
Food served quite fast with angus beef platter as the star dish. Nicely charred with a good fried rice as the accompanied dish. Only problem is the service really needs improving.
5
Not easy to find but food is worth the hunt.
The place is located at 6th floor which is quite a distance walk from the lift (shady too)
3
We were very much looking forward to dinner at this much talked about restaurant in their new industrial building canteen location. By the time we completed our meal, we wandered what the buzz was all about. The crabs, done in chilli crab style and pepper style, were edible but not memorable. Their famous Boss beehoon and beef fried rice did not have the required wok hei and yummy finish. The beef was good. The general ambience was messy and wash areas need sprucing up, in spite of private rooms. A great pity, as this place has the potential to be a happy successful local food venue.
4
It was our first visit there, as a birthday celebration. i wanted to have (big crabs) and a friend recommended me the place. We ordered a 1.6 kg crab. since it was a big crab, we could have it done two ways, an idea which we like. Both the garlic and black pepper style was done nicely. Crabs were fresh and yummy :)Service not bad too! Would return to try the other menu items
3
There is room for improvement in service - 1) we requested for a table next to the table assigned to us but the waitress responded without any smile: 'No. We assigned this table for you.' We couldn't understand why couldn't change when both tables are if the same size. 2) When the waiter cleared the table, he re-cycled the set of utensil not being used. This is very unhygenic
1
We had a big group of 13; 7 adults and 5 kids under 6. Although we were given the air-con room, it was so packed and noisy. My 2 1/2 year old girl was sitting on the high chair but her chair got knocked into at least 5 times. So I've to carry her. No way to change the location of her high chair position as we were in a corner on the room. The server were mainly outside. There was only 1 waiter inside so it took a long time to place order for the set meal. We ordered the Cze Char delight set menu. And the set meal was written in a confusing layout for the 4th dish. Please look into improving your menu. We don't understand all the OR or And. You can consider labeling or categorizing them in group and numbering the dishes.... There was free drink for the set meal but the waiter didn't even ask us. Ordered our food and he's gone... took anther 20min to order drinks. :( Another bad service : When the server served a dish (a small plate of black looking meat), we just ask him what dish was that. His replied shocked us; "You don't know what your order?" We were taken a back. The reason why we ask was the dish doesn't fit into any other dish in the menu so we want to confirm if it has been served to the correct table. He didn't bother to check & he left. now he told us is only a server and he only serve food and he does not do any other thing.... That's a good excuse. Ok, since he is only a server then we check with the waiter.So we had to wait for the only waiter in the room to be free and that dish turns out to be smoked pork collar. It wasnt like smoked... it jusy look like stir fried pork belly in dark soya sauce...The Hong Kong Kai Lan Special was horrible. THe deep fried leave were overcooked & turn out bitter. The other stir fried portion was filed with pesticide smell; Gosh!!! they didnt bother to wash the vege... This is my first & last trip here.....
4
The place has a slight seaside vibe even though it is located in an industrial building you wouldn’t expect to find such good food. The food is rather exquisite, and although it is slightly pricey, I personally think it’s worth it :)
4
The famous steak and fried rice never disappoint me. The boss bee hoon was great too - except too oily.
4
Service was very good and food was good too. Elsie was our server and she was very sincere and personal.
4
every dish here was really good, but there was a mix up in orders and we waited so long for our food
5
Perfect place for groups. We liked everything we ordered. Great evening and will be back again very soon!

It is our first time dining at this new location at Lam Soon Industrial Building. We made reservations for 6.30pm, arrived at 6.10pm and was shown to table 82. We placed our order at 6.20pm and told the person who took the order that we are still waiting for 1 more person and to hold till we let them know when to serve.At 6.33pm, we told one of the staff that they can proceed to serve the dishes. The Bamboo Clam which we had reserved was served in less than 5mins which took us by surprise. After that, we had to ask 3 times for our rice to be served, it was finally served after 10mins.We wanted to order more drinks and looked at the menu again and each time, it was difficult to get the attention of the 2 staff standing behind. They were either busy chatting or looking at their mobile phones. We had to raise our voices to get their attention. We waited till 6.55pm and the rest of our dishes were still not served. We ask the staff to check and they came back to tell us that we had asked for the dishes to be put on hold!? Perhaps the Bamboo Clams were not meant for our table. Clearly there was miscommunication amongst the staff but no one bothered to apologize to us. The quality of the food was still good but I'm very disappointed with the service. The occasions when I've been to Sin Ming, I've had way better service despite the crowd
4
Never before did I think sitting in a car park (or edge of car park) for dinner in plastic plates will be such a fun dinner. Well, it was. Steak was amazing, chilli crab too, boys enjoyed the chicken and we all had a great time at a reasonable price
4
The restaurant was good but then during the reservation process I was not told of the end time of my reservation. Hence we were rushed out of the restaurant nearer to the end of dinner. I think it would be a good idea to indicate the entire duration of the reservation.
2
Have a chance to dine in this eating place this evening and was rather curious to find the eating place packed with dinners. Prior to my visit I have already heard of this place hence we decided to order their famous BBQ Angus beef, Pork ribs, Blue Mussels, Steam Squids and Fried Bee Hoon. All these dishes were also highly recommended by the waitress who attend to us.If I have to use one word to describe my experience dining here, it would be “disappointing” for me. Disappointed not just because the foods were badly presented, they taste normal and they are not value for money in my view. Disappointment also on how my fellow Singaporeans can fall for this eating place when they are many Zi Char places can cook the sane dishes much better than this eating place. The beef and Pork ribs were served cold and this leads me to suspect that the beef was not cooked when order, but it was mass produced in the kitchen as it is one of the “must order” dishes. The blue mussels were also badly prepared too with about 10% of the mussels still tightly closed, in my view you can get much better blue mussels along Clark quay or any bistro in town area. If there is anything good about this eating place it would be their service. Service wise I would say they fair above average. And if I am ask would I revisit this eating place again, my answer would be a “firm NO” because there is nothing that can attract me to want to come back again, not to mention that I can easily get the same type of foods in many of our Zi Char stores. To me, this is only a eating place, a crowded eating place. It is not really a restaurant cause most of the dishes were cooked before you place the order, that’s why they are served cold and not steaming hot. To sum up it is only fair to say that this is a like and dislike eating place as they are people who like the foods here and they are people like me do not find the foods here tempting.
5
I can't remember if I have ever written a review on this restaurant. I have been here many times during days where they are located to Sim Ming till now where they re located in Hillview. Each time, the food and service never fail. This restaurant is really a mixed bag of seafood and steak house; Malayto Chinese to western cuisine; steam to grill. Every dish in the menu is well executed and prepared. Flavours are not fusion but exact for the dish itself. So I believe they just go with selecting their best dish in each cuisine and put them into one menu book. Service is friendly and fast. I really cannot complain in a local zi Char setting sort of place. Bonus! Free corkage for any number of bottles BYO. Easy parking. Please make a reservation a few days in advance.
5
Prepare to steak out. Rice to the occasion. Eat the crabs outta youselves. Oh yes, tonkatsu very much.
5
Definitely on pricey side, but the food quality is excellent. Staff is attentive, friendly and accommodating. Food is served rather quickly. Pleasant experience. Will sure come back
5
It wasn't so crowded during lunch which was good. Service was good and prompt. Food was of cos delicious. Parking was free. Only setback was biten by mosquito cos it is not aircon
2
I went new ubi seafood with my hubby to celebrate my birthday and the foods taste average but the service is good.
4
We ordered about 8 dishes for 4 people along with a beer tower, totaling at $280(~$70/Pax)
Dishes are all really good, especially the famous angus steak!
4
Try the beef and crab. Get some fried bun to go with crab. Steamed fish just so-so. Advanced booking is required.
4
A good place for people who like beef, lamb and pork. They do it a special; Asian fused with western way.
4
A great zichar place that is near the west. When many great eatery has been hailed from the east, this is a great hideout in the residential area / factory where you can taste of the real "wok - hei" in their dishes. Although it is slightly pricely on the dishes but the quality is there
4
We had a most interesting and enjoyable dinner at New Ubin Seafood Restaurant. Interestingly the menu also offers meat dishes, most famous is the Australian ribeye steak with "heart-attack" fried rice using the fat from the steak which is absolutely moorish!!! Equally delicious are the chilli crab and black pepper crab which are finger licking good the owner SM Pang is charming and hospitable. It definitely is a "must-go" restaurant in Singapore 
2
The restaurant seems overrated. It looks more like a canteen. And it is situated in some kind of industrial building. Crowded and noisy. Not sure if this is because there are not many choices around that neighbourhood. Dishes were really average. The 600gm steak looked more like 400gm to me and already cost $84. Serving staff and waiters were just overwhelmed. I felt sorry for them. They were working like robots. If you prefer some ambience, go elsewhere. Not going back anymore.
5
the foods was good! the freshness of the crab and so meaty! ambiance and atmosphere was great! will come again!
4
Good food and good service, with the waiter kindly advising us on the best combi of dishes for our lunch. Quite hard to find, but because we went during lunch, we were lucky enough to be seated in the airconditioned section. Will return!
5
Beef was great. Tequila chicken was unique. Garlic butter crab and hokkien mee was above average. Overall, great experience.
4
Have to tray the Angus Beef Steak. It is the best dish and it comes with beef, fried rice, and potato wedges.
2
Entered from the rear of the restaurant instead of the front but no one bothered to tell us anything. We waited for a while before someone directed us to the front. Placing our orders, asking for chilli on the table and asking for our rice after all the dishes were served took many, many tries. And it wasn't even like they were trying to be nice about it. Some of them just gave the curd nod and never came back
4
Surprisingly is not crowded for sat late lunch. Food was nice as usual, but the beef steak that we order feels a bit cold, especially when comparing to the hot fried rice, it's even more obvious. Staff was right in asking us just order one more additional dish, portion was definitely enough for 2.
5
Great food, every item ordered was delicious and the portion is just right for sharing. We had butter crab, USA beef platter with heart Attack fried rice, egg yolk squid, fish roe with petai sambal dip, fried Hokkien mee and xo chicken. The dessert of pulut hitam with coconut ice cream is great for sharing too. Limited aircon tables, but ample parking! Definitely will be back
4
Funny how the restaurant has morphed from a seafood place to one that does really great meats - the steaks and the pork collar. The seafood is still very good, especially the crabs, salted egg calamari and the steamed bamboo clams. Price is not cheap for a canteen ambience but the good is really good.
4
Been back to New Ubin in the new locale of Lam Soon Industrial bldg. I must say the locale is as exotic as previously nested in the car workshop area of Sin Ming. So taking newbies there creates some ooh and aah. Fortunately the food continues to be just as good. Plus free corkage gives this place a plus. Their baked garlic crab, Mee goreng, halibut with petai sambal sauce, black bean bitter gourd fish head and satay are constant family favourites. Been here over 6 times and old Sin Ming probably even more so there's basis to my review
3
[1] Chilli crab sauce watery. I understand when its cool - the sauce will turns watery BUT this is not the case as it comes watery. Could you make thicker sauce ?[2] Man-tou bun is very tiny - smaller than the many times I came to you. And at $1 it really turns me off to enjoy my chilli crab with man-tou. Could you make the bun BIGGER ?[3] Service is still excellent
4
Meal came promptly and all dishes were scraped clean. Steak especially good. Staff did become a little too obsessed with closing time, however
1
Never fail to receive bad service from this restaurant. Server was uninterested to recommend, as usual.
5
U.S. Angus Rib-eye Steak and Heart Attack Fried Rice was really good! Location was a little out of the way, service was alright.
5
Food was good though a little pricey, love the atmosphere as the weather was perfect and it wasn't too hot or smoky
3
Extremely difficult to make a reservation as they hardly pick up calls. Food is not bad but does not justify the high price.
5
We went to the restaurant to celebrate a birthday and we had a great time! The food was delicious and the staff very friendly and helpful.
5
We'd always wanted to try New Ubin out since it moved to the West (and we live nearby, hooray) but we never seem to remember to make early reservations. Popular dinner timings (from 6 to 7ish) are always snapped up early so make sure you 'chope' your tables early ;) Food was served promptly and I must say we really enjoyed the Hokkien Mee, Orh Chien and Garlic Bake Crab! Polished off every speck on the plates! We will be back very soon for the Angus Beef. I've a feeling this is going to be our family's favourite eatery. Thanks for a lovely dinner
3
We went to have lunch at the new place. Service staff were responsive. The satay was juicy and yummy. It was the best dish for the day. The crab, however was hollow, not meaty and too salty. When we have feedback to the staff they told us to return the whole crab before eating. The fried omelette was too oily. Overall we felt that it was not a great lunch. May not return.
4
Food was good in general though a little steep on the price. However, service was extremely great when the waiter took time to explain certain food items on the menu and gave us opinions on the quantity and what we should order which were really useful when we placed our order. A shout out to the great staff - Shawn/Sean
4
hello. maybe their foie gras isn't the tastiest in singapore, but its damn good and at $7.50 for 3 large chunks, if you want to sup upon MASS QUANTITIES of it there's no better place.the XXL sri lankan crab was the best crab I've had in singapore bt
4
Their signature dish is the fried rice with steak and boss bee hoon, which is similar to the heart attack fried rice you see in Eighteen Chefs.
3
The place is a bit warm. Order 2x 800gms Crabs. But 1 seems to be lesser than 800gms.
Yellow Roe Cold Crabs - Good
US BLACK ANGUS RIBEYE STEAK - Good
Garlic Baked Crab - Good
Salted Egg - OK.
The rest - OK
4
My first visit here with my husband and we were blown away by their prawn hokkien mee, bamboo clams and prawn paste chicken. Service staff were excellent as well.
5
Food portion is just nice and taste is fabulous.
Staff were polite and well knowledge of their menu.
Price is reasonable
Overall our son enjoyed his birthday dinner. He make the right choice on choosing to eat at New Ubin Seafood
3
Had difficult locating the place, no signage at the building at all.
Food was good, specially love the beef steak, boss bee hoon, prices not cheap!
4
I came to this place with the local friend here. First when I arrived I thought it was a wrong place the entrance from the building which I can't imagine will have the restaurant in here. We used the lift and walk through the car park and here it is the restaurant. It was very busy. I went inside the set up very casual which for me I didn't expect that the food will be different from the setting. We ordered Steak, Egg with Foie Gras, Rice cook in beef fat, Squid with salty egg, Vegetable, Crab with Chili sauce, Tequila chicken and Razor clams. Egg Foie Gras was amazing simple but the taste was very good. Steak was nice. Squid is one of my favourite dish too the way they cook the salty egg that I never see before. Tequila Chicken is a must dish. Razor Clam was delicate especially the broth went very well with the clams. Overall my experience was exceed expectations. If you are looking to have a good food I would highly recommend this place for dinner
5
Went back to our favourite restaurant for crab! Their garlic baked crab and white pepper crab taste the best! This time round we tried the salted egg yolk crab where the crab is coated with salted egg yolk! It is nice as well. Too bad the promotion of the 3 for the price of 2 small crab is over, if not I will visit there more often.
4
Seafood is a big thing in Singapore and many places do give you good fare. This place deviates somewhat from the ordinary. For starters instead of going for chili or pepper crab (which are good) you may want to try the garlic crab instead. - aromatic and creamy with a lovely flavour that heightens the sweetness snd juiciness of the crab. Another dish you cannot skip - even if you think you don't like that vegetable - is the brinjal! I would go there just for that! My kids who absolutely don't eat brinjals were converted into groupies of this wonderful dish. You'd not have tried it elsewhere! If you want a meat dish - the beef is a must! Smoky, cooked to perfection and bursting with flavour. Another dish worth trying is the durian creme brûlée- so smooth and flavorful- made from Mao Shan wang durians so you can be assured of the quality... if durian is not your thing... then go for the banana with gula Melaka and coconut ice cream. While it's tucked away in an industrial building the ambience is surprisingly quaint and comfortable. Another surprise on the menu is that it also prepares seafood done Indian style... though I've not tried that yet..
2
Service was bad. Too crowded, noisy and took them 40 mins just to take our order. They didn't bother to change once our plates throughout the dinner. Honestly I've tasted much better and cheaper Zi Char places. The only dish was above average is the grilled steak
3
Made a reservations for 7pm and wound up having a table at 7.30pm. Again waited almost an hour for first dish to be served. Orders for four crabs was changed to 8 cray fish because they have none left.10 minutes later was told that the crayfish is not enough and will have to content with 4 cray fish and 2 crabs (surprised they told me that they have none left) As the staff are excellent and very responsive, I did not pursue the issue and happily go with their suggestions.Overall dishes are average but with the excellent staff like that, they should up their food menu with sufficient forecast or some nasty customers will take it out on them.5 stars for the server
5
Must eat stake in this restaurant. Very soft and delicious. But chilly crab is too spicy for child. Let's try
4
knuckle is excellent &value for money. grill prawn is over cooked.
steam groupa meat is powdery texture not fresh.
4
Other than the ambience, everything else is perfect here! Food was served surprisingly fast and awesomely delicious!
4
Great food served here. You must try the garlic crabs that taste extremely good. Cereal prawns too. Not forgetting the durian dessert.
4
tried this place at its old hood before years ago and finally got to try it at its new premise at hillview. still really good. steak is a must-try though the kangkong can be spicier in my opinion.
5
Awkwardly located, but once found you'll end up in a lovely setting with friendly personel and simply wonderful food.
5
Chillie crab and wagyu beef with heart attack fried rice should not be missed. Great value for money. Good service and friendly staff
3
Went with a party of 10 with prior reservation (I was told that the restaurant is so popular that you can't walk in and expect to get a table). Our reservation was for 7.30pm but we were kept waiting for about 20minutes before they show us to our table. We ordered quite a variety of dishes - prawn paste fried chicken, brinjal delight, boss beehoon, chili crab, salted egg prawns, chai po kway teo, beef and accompanying rice, oyster omelette, seafood udon and 3 types of dessert - yam paste, pulut hitam and fresh fruits. The first few dishes were served very quickly, within 15 mins. But we waited more than an hour for the prawns and crab. The standout dishes were the beef and accompanying rice plus the boss beehoon. Rest of the dishes were average. I went to this restaurant when it was previously located at Sin Ming. Felt that the standard has dropped though the place is definitely much cleaner and more organized. If you want to try, please make reservation and request to be seated in the air conditioned room. Our meal costs us about $440. Oh, please ask the waiter to repeat your orders and also check the bill before paying. They missed out one of our orders and also charged us for coconut drink which we did not order.
5
Tried and tested their food when they were located at Sin Ming. Standard of the food is still there. Love the crispy pork knuckle!!!! Service was quite prompt. However we went there for dinner time and the building number wasn't very visible (hidden by shadow). Apart from that, all is good. Just make sure you make booking in advance!
4
A group of 20 of us had dinner there on a few Saturday nights ago.We had pre-ordered the Dinner Set menu and for a place which is smack in an industrial building on the 6th storey car park, it's terribly popular...we had to wait for 15 mins past our booking time! And were told that we have to finish by 9.30pm!Besides the lively noise, there's nothing much for ambience but the food is very goodand for the price, the serving portions are generousHighly recommend the Sri Lankan crabs done in 3 styles-Chilly, Garlic & butter and Black Pepper; the very addictive Caramelised Brinjal delight; and the unusual US Black Angus Ribeye with fried rice.For drinks, just go with the free flow lime juice and Chinese Tea
5
Great seafood, good atmosphere, very friendly service. Fantastic crabs, definitely have to use the hands for these. A bit hard to find but well worth going.
4
Ordered a salted egg crab, was good.
Order kai lan and pork knuckles as well.... so so only
baby squid was crispy...
5
The best seafood ever, location was weird but with the price given, it's worth it, satisfying meal, no doubt!
3
The location is quite out of way. Food was nice and interesting. However, the price is slightly steep.
4
Went to the old ubin seafood at sin ming and was amazed by the good food! First time here after they moved. Service can be improved
2
Food portion was small. Not worth the price paid. Too expensive. Price stated on menu was not accurate when reflected on the final bill.
5
Great local food! Favourite items are beef, prawn paste chicken and the caixin. Reserve before hand - it gets crowded!
5
I've tried the New Ubin Seafood restaurant when it was still at the old Sin Ming Industrial area, and that was when I was totally captivated by its service and quality of food! Being a steak and crab lover, I was bought over by the marvelous food that I was served! The crabs were fresh, and the medium-rare US Black Angus Ribeye steak dipped in salt and mustard sauce, serves with the fried rice was a killer! The only set-back that time was the horrendous parking situation that I had to put up with.Thankfully, the restaurant has moved so much closer to where I stay, with ample parking! Guess what? The service and food quality remain just as excellent! I was reminded by sms on my reservation, and even offered to place a pre-order of fresh oysters and "Can Boleh" aka Creme Brulee made from Mao Shan Wang durian! The crab was PERFECT with its freshness and tender meat, topped with the fried buns. And the dish that stole the show was of course, the US Black Angus Ribeye steak with the fried rice! The steak was done perfectly medium-rare and the thought of it still makes me salivate!! I'm very much looking forward to my next visit in the near future...Thanks for the awesome food and service, New Ubin Seafood! ...and did I mention that there is no corkage charge for the wine bottle that you bring in?
4
Foie gras was delicious, but looks different from what was on the menu. Not value for money.Steak was very tasty, with good dips of sea salt and mustard. We were recommended medium rare, but it wasn't consistently medium rare - not sure what went wrong ther
4
on that day, my family and I were celebrating our daughter's birthday. We were surprised that they provided a complimentary chocolate mousse with a candle for dinner. The service was excellent and the staff was very attentive. I was a bit disappointed with the food. We ordered the chilli crab and garlic backed crab which was on promotion with free salted egg sleeper lobster. It also comes with complimentary rice. We also ordered the steak and vegetable. The staff did not ask for the doneness of the steak. It came out rare. We then requested for the steak to be cooked again. The food was not as good as I had hoped as their signature crab dish did not impress. The value of the items that we have ordered is fantastic compared to other places. At the end of the day, the ambiance saved the day
3
Great restaurant, great setting, rustic decor, however pricing was exorbitant. Quality of food has taken a dipped since their days at Sin Ming. Could be better, but definitely still good.
4
I tried a couple dishes and for a Chinese themed restaurant in a industrial building, it's surprising good. Esp for the lamb rack which is very tender and delicious! Thumbs up!
4
Their reputation is well deserved. The food was superb though bit pricey. Our party of 5 had the famed beef, garlic baked crab, steam prawns,n soft shell crab, 3 cup chicken and topped by fried bee noon. All in, great stuff, place was extremely packed.
4
Reservation was conveniently gone over chope website. Restaurant also send a reminder SMS of reservation. Appreciate such service. Food was great. Definitely will visit again
5
Lovely seafood. Value for money. The crabs are very fresh. The black pepper steak is done just right. Great place to hang out with friends.
1
Can't believe some people say the food is good!
It was absolutely nothing.
For every dish, I can think of at least 3 to 5 other places that serves better.
Nothing is reasonable priced.
4
Recommended dishes will be beef steak with fried rice, fresh oyster, pepper crab and stir fried kai lan vegetable. Desserts like banana with coconut ice cream and chocolate lava cake were awesome. Looking forward to try new dishes next visit.Service staff are friendly and helpful. Expect slight waiting time even with reservation made. Good to make reservations 2 weeks in advance. They will confirm reservation via sms and also take pre-orders for their seasonal items. Request during reservation if you prefer a table in air-conditioned area as many tables are outdoor with shelter
3
Steak was great, but the crabs/lobster was average - dry. Long waiting time (understand they're busy but would be good if they times the service better) and the indoor seating atmosphere wasn't very good as there were no windows/opening to allow sound to get out, it was very echoey and hard to have conversation unless you raise your voice. If you can choose, sit outdoor seating. But thank you for having us
5
Despite a change in location, New Ubin Seafood still kept their great service, great food and even the rustic ambiance! The restaurant was packed on a Sunday night, but staff remained attentive and food came out quickly. Added the garlic fried lobster as recommended, to my usual menu and it was delicious
4
Worth the detour to have some of the highlights on the menu, but seriously... this place is hard to find, in a Super weird industrial area with a weird layout that's just plain uncomfortable and yet it still brings in the crowds.Come dressed light and expect the same comfort as a hawker centre... don't even dream about this place being like a food court.Have the boss man bee hoon, black Angus steak and fried rice with drippings. Lots of other stars on the menu.Make sure you book ahead because this place is always crowded
5
food was superb as per recommendation. The portions were decent. The place was big and comfy for us to enjoy a hearty meal with our friends
3
Spent $400 food taste is over rated. Staff service is good
Food is average . 3star. Just the crab and prawn I order is not fresh , crayfish and soon hock is good
5
Enjoyed the meal thoroughly. Oysters were fresh. The omelet was awesome. Loved the fried rice. Downside : fish was not fresh and overcooked.
4
The food were better than my last visit which was really disappointing. The heart attack fried rice was way better. Overall it was ok. But whenever it comes to getting the free lime juice, the waiting time is extremely long or forgotten.
4
The family enjoyed the mains: their signature steak and heart attack friend rice were yummy. So was the garlic baked crab. But the orh bee didn't provide a sweet ending. It was v v dry. Like dried glue. :(.
Overall still a good experience.
4
Been to the new outlet a couple of times and the garlic crab has been spectacular each time! Succulent sweet crab coated in a delicious salty garlic glaze.
4
Went there for family dinner on a thursday evening and it was packed with people. Had the famous noodle and bee hoon. Also the crab (chili crab and the salt egg). The chili crab was good. Overall the food was delicious and nice.

It is very hard to describe New Ubin Seafood! Try hawker centre style seating with incredible local dishes crossed with a great steakhouse.The looks aren't fancy, the location is unusual but the food is amazing.This is a classic "local treasure" that if someone has taken you there it quickly becomes your favourite casual dining spot.The food crosses many countries and styles, so everyone will have something they love, and the cooking is first class, generous and super tasty.The pork ribs are to die for, the steak top shelf and, oh yes they also do amazing seafood!Get casual, and get down to New Ubin Seafood - you can thank me later
5
Booked early enough to be seated in the air-conditioned section and food was very nice and tasty for the whole family - age range from 3 years to 79 years . Service was excellent and they were on hand to also recommend dishes that turned out great
2
It's a place with a kampung (small village) ambience so if you like authenticity go for it. Food there is overpriced for the quality though, the crabs were really small and the slipper lobster had no meat. Also, the fish seemed to be frozen and not fresh. Only saving grace was the beef but even that was ok and not fantastic. We ordered 2smaller sized portions (580g) because the rest of the food wasn't great. The 2nd time the fried rice was charred and not as good as the first one.Go only if you're nearby and only want to eat beef
4
I like the set meal that we ordered especially the beef and pepper crab. My family liked every dishes. A good place for family dinner.
5
Good food. Service need to improve. Servicing too slow and forgetful No attention to details. Overall, food is excellent.
4
This is not your usual Zi Char with numerous must order specialties dishes like Egg Foie Gras, Garlic Crab, Angus Beef etc.
3
Wasn't too impressed with the food this time. Had the pork ribs, boss beehoon and garlic crab but all were average nothing too impressive and price was on the higher side.
4
it's a neighborhood seafood place. local and authentic.food itself was ok, slightly above average to were to comment.we ordered different type of seafood, they were good, but not surprisingly good.size of bamboo clam ere a bit small, and bbq squids were very small - not recommend to order in fact.We tried the grilled live tiger prawns ($13/100g!), taste was so so, just missing the chewy texture, wonder what's wrong.we had the oyster omelette too, the oysters were extremely sweet and yummy. just there were only 4-5 pcs in.Staff attitude were superb, very helpful and professional.Just when the restaurant was full, it's a bit under-staff.we are paying $140 for 2, wonder if we should have ordered the 2-people set instead. Maybe next time.Yet, given the place was in fact a bit far from town center, not worth the travel all the way. Suggest to go only when you are around the neighborhood, or is driving

We went over for dinner on a Sunday night. Reservations highly recommended. Our party of 8 was seated in the air-conditioned room. Interesting set-up as it is basically a non-air con restaurant except for that 2-3 large air-con rooms which can seat about 6-8 tables per room. It was my first time there after hearing my friends rave about the place. Free parking, just drive up the ramp and follow the lights! Once you get up to the floor, one will not miss it. Now the food. Interesting mix of local zi-char, seafood and western food. The US prime beef served on their wooden board comes with helpings of potato wedges, was very good. It comes with a plate of fried rice, using oil from beef. Tastes good. However, it doesn't come cheap. We also ordered the drunken prawns, which was fresh and succulent. But those who love a more herbal soup may find that a little 'light'. We also ordered the usual hot plate tofu and the Har Cheong chicken wing (prawn paste chicken wings). They were tasty, but I find the tofu a little salty. We also tried the Boston lobster with efu noodles. Nice, but again, a little salty. Priced charged separately for lobster and noodles. Not cheap. The 3-egg spinach vegetable dish was not fantastic as they did not use the round leaf spinach. This made the veg tough. They had used the long stemmed chinese spinach which restaurants usually use with mushrooms and abalone. The fried HK Kai Lan was a saving grace as it was very nicely stir-fried and part of the leaf was cut and minced and fried crispy. This made the dish very delicious. I find the white rice we oredered to go with the dishes of good quality, not the cheap jasmine rice. Overall, the experience was good, but did not come cheap. Probably depending on what you order, it may be reasonably priced meal. They can definitely use a little less salt in their cooking

We had one night in Singapore and wanted our dinner to be something delicious and memorable.We decided on seafood in particular .After researching we found New Ubin ! And we weren't disappointed.Our hotel was in Scotts road ( cross road Orchard Rd) so we orders a cab and it took about 10 mins to arrive. The restaurant itself was really tricky to find as it's in an industrial type area with no signage outside. The cab driver was great though and after asking a pedestrian we found it.We had a reservation ( did from Australia) and upon arrival were seated. The wait staff were extremely helpful and only too happy to answer questions and advise on dishes. The food was beyond our expectations. Fresh and delicious . We had the crab 800gms for 2 persons it was cooked in white pepper sauce and was soooooo good. Cooked to perfection and just so yummy. We had Kankong ( green vegetables ) cooked in belecan , prawns baked in oatmeal!! Sounds different but try them. Whole prawns in shells cooked in oven covered in oatmeal . Similar to prawns cooked in salt or clay idea. The prawns were a highlite. Juicy sweet so yummy. We had oyster omelette crispy style again perfect and full of fresh plump oysters and beautiful eggs as well. We had creme brûlée with durian and a durian custard style dessert too. We adore durian and found these 2 desserts absolutely Devine impetuous! My husband had beer Asahi and I had lime juice.We were 2 very happy satisfied diners. The food the location the staff everything about this restaurant was fantastic and we would definitely go back .
4
Angus beef was really good. Fried rice that came with it was more like claypot rice (black one too) than the usual zhichar fried rice. 600g of beef for $85. Quite expensive. Salted egg soft shell crab has generous salted egg but kinda oily ($12/crab). Orh Luak was really good! Super huge oysters with very little flour/egg. But again the egg/flour was oily. $18 for 4 huge oysters. Tequila chicken was very fragrant. They pour the alcohol in front of you and you can really taste the alcohol in the gravy and chicken. Overall good food
3
The service was pretty good, the staff were rather attentive and patient. However, some of the food was quite a disappointment especially the US Black Angus Rib Eye Beef. It is overrated, the beef was bland and cold. Worst still, the Heart Attack Fried Rice that comes with it was dry and hard. The only hit was the hokkien mee which was pretty decent
4
The quality of the food was as expected based on previous visits at their old location. Would've preferred the beef to be cut into slightly bigger cubes so you can appreciate the flavour a little more and it would've hopefully not gotten totally cold within minutes due to the tiny bite-size cuts. Pros and cons... I've been to their previous location before which felt bright and lively but parking wasn't easy there and I didn't particularly like the industrial area and the random stray dog loitering around scared me a little. The Hillview outlet felt a lot smaller and more like an industrial building canteen (which it probably is). There's free parking and a huge car park at Hillview though which is a plus. I will be back for sure for a simple zhi char meal.
4
Service was quick and food was great. Had their best known dishes and was as good as ever. Will go back again.
4
Great Services.
Food are good but a little salty to our taste.
Great place for family outing and gathering.
4
Looked forward to the Angus beef fried rice, but the rice was not nearly as flavourful as before. Beef was still good. Salted egg soft shell crab was also great.
4
Food was pretty good - prawn paste chicken was da best. So was the famous Ubin Mee Goreng. Not so hot about the butter crab, although the chilly crab was tasty.
5
Enjoyed the meal with family, food quality is superb and tasty especially the crab with black pepper!
5
One of the fine eateries in Singapore that offers a fuse of cuisines in Singapore. Rustically located, my family and I like the food, not forgetting the price that is reasonable.
2
greeted with friend staff (special shout out to Elsie) who takes the extra mile to ensure we don't over order :) Sous vide egg with chargrilled foie gras was GREAT! However the main dish US angus beef with fried rice were utter disappointment. They were served warm and dry, as though they were cooked earlier on, and heated up prior to serving to customer as these were served ard 10 mins after we placed order. Hope it could be better when we revisit next

Just had one of my worst dining experience at New Ubin Seafood. We ordered its signature dish "Beef Steak" of 600grams which comes with the Beef Fried Rice. We were only served the Fried Rice without the Beef Steak. As this was our first time here, we weren't aware that the Beef Steak was missing. We didn't think much about it but were slightly disappointed that this famous dish was such a letdown being so plain (only had the Fried Rice). So at the end of our meal, we proceeded to make payment for our meal. We were very shocked that the plain fried rice is going to cost us S$84 and we tried to clarify with the cashier. Instead of finding out more details from us, she blatantly told us this is the usual price for that dish. At this time, we were holding up the cashier's queue. And of course, we were deeply embarrassed with many others in the queue overhearing our conservation. We tried explaining that we did not see the 600g of beef at all. It was with much insistence on our end that sent the staff to go checking with the kitchen. I do not understand why the staff do not have the initiative to check in the first place and save us from all these awkwardness.After the checking on their end, it was confirmed that it wasindeed an oversight on New Ubin Seafood's part. Servicerecovery was bad, no apologies or explanations were given.With such an experience, I do not see myself going back topatronise this place ever again. Just a word of advice to all:Do check your dishes when they have been served andscrutinise your bill before payment
1
it was a dissappointed experience when we re-visited this place at the new location. I must say that the overall dining experience was not as good as before. From the service to the foods. We usually prefer ala-carte, but this time we decided to go for the 4-6person menu totalling at s$300. The presentation and plating of the foods is herrendous! Worst than the normal Tze-char restaurants. And the meat platter, the way they chopped the meat and present is very amateurish! Like a massacre of chopped meat on the board. Everything just not photograhable.Also the servers seem less enthusiastic than before, pretty rush in taking order and service, and forgetful. The dessert we had was kaya toast. And its really not good and worst than kopitiam's. We were a big fans of this restaurant, we totally understand the concept, but the foods, the service, the new environment, just does not live up to the standard and hassle to travel here for foods. Honestly, you can get a so much better foods with half the price elsewhereIn Singapore

We visited the place to try the highly recommended angus beef which was served on a huge board with mustard, salt and chilli sauce. It was also accompanied by wedges and rice fried in the beef oil. The beef (medium cooked) was really juicy and we enjoyed it! Most people seem to be there for this and a cup of red wine.But the dish that i really really loved was their ovenbaked crab (as recommended by the staff). It looked kinda dry at first but we were soo wrong. We took the first piece and alr noticed how fresh and juicy the meat was. It was then tt we licked our fingers and oh man it was finger licking good. The oven baked goodness somehow retained the sweetness from the crab and the saltiness from the ocean. Really satisfying :)Other than the two main stars, we tried the hokkien mee but the fishy taste was abit overwhelming for me. The yam paste would have been better with some oil cause it was a little to dry. But we appreciated that it was legit yam. Anw i will definitely be back for the crab as well as to try other dishes! Bonus points for great service!
3
Went there on Fri evening with friends, quite crowded and the seating is constrain as they try to optimize space. Not a nice ambient and felt a bit warm. But food is good, maybe a bit oily
3
Drinks was served separately for hot & cold. The in between time took quite awhile.
Food was nice but 1 of my order was missed out.
1
Food is served half cooked, the dishes full of food stain and stuck on the bowls and plate. Food take 1 hr plus to serve when there's no crowd yet.
4
Celebrated Mum's birthday on a Saturday night.Hits: hokkien mee (very flavourful!), Salt baked XL Sri Lankan crab, patin catfish (massive portion!)Misses: signature medium-rare steak (steak was lukewarm) with wedges and rice fried with beef fat (rice was dry with little flavour)Overall a pleasant experience. Place seemed a tad quiet compared to when we visited in Sin Ming, possibly due to them only accepting reservations now
4
The standard of the food remind as good as the old venue in Sin Ming. But now the venue is too far, we did not drive as we need to drink. it was quite a distance from the MRT and we had to call for cabs after the dinner which took quite a while
5
Our 2nd visit here, this time to try their individual noodle dish, the Fried Hokkien Mee Special. Comes in 2 sizes, $14 for small and $29 for large, but the small could be shared between 2 people. The HKM comes with prawns, whole baby squids, pacific clams, and pork lard. This is the very wet kind with alot of gravy, rich in egg. Worth a try if you are around the area
1
too expensive for their mediocre angus ribeye steak. cost 2 of us $95+ for a min 500g steak which turns out to be 550g, 5 sticks of satays, and their 'free' fried rice making out of the residuals of the steak which is unhealthy & horrible. no more next time

Firstly New Ubin Seafood as moved to: 63 Hillview Avenue, Level 6 (Canteen) Lam Soon Industrial Building, Singapore 669569. It is on the same level as the upper deck car park - drive straight up to the car park.Secondly this is NOT the usual restaurant where the menu is solely fixed on a particular cuisine. It is very much a Singapore-style east-plus-west-plus-local food selection. And do not expect the usual restaurant setting. This is much more rustic, more homey and seemingly "make-shift".My favourites here are: (1) Wagyu steak + fried rice; (2) Boss bee hoon; (3) Smoked pork collar; (4) Crispy baby squid; and, (5) Oyster omelette.Service is quite brisk and efficient. However do make reservations for dinner service. Expect a queue

Food was slightly above average zi char. Was there with my wife and friends from Malaysia. For the hype, we expected the food to be better than it was. We ordered the signature pork knuckle - it was crispy but not as tasty as some very good western stalls. The salted egg sotong was also not fried as we were expecting.
4
Family had a nice dinner and we tried some new dishes but the old favourites were still great. The kids loved the satay and the pork ribs.
4
it is usually crowded, better to book 2 weeks in advance. food was good as usual. theres air con indoor sitting too
3
Ordered 10 pax set meal. Food was good, but maybe due to the time we arrive, 2pm (last order was at 2:15pm). The staff were kinda of rushing us and pushing of convenience for themselves.
3
Pre-ordered the foods but waited for more than half an hour. Last dish came after an hour. A bit disappointed. What's the point to pre-order the food and ended up waited for more than an hour.
4
Is really inconvenient for the location as we have no car. But overall food was good and fast on serving. Will definitely come back again.
4
The food are all nice and sumptuous. The location is hard to find but convenient parking at level 6.
4
As you stand surrounded by auto repair shops, your first thought will be to question whether you've got the right address. Your second will be to wonder whether you've travelled back in time, such is the appearance of the place. But look closer and you'll see a small lounge, a fish tank and a sizeable wine cellar. On offer are mostly Zi Char dishes and seafood, like butter crab, but don't ignore the charcoal-grilled American rib-eye
5
We celebrated my father in-law's birthday there with the family and enjoyed ourselves thoroughly! Food was fantastic and served without any delays. Easy to order due to the warm hospitality and professional service that greeted us right from the start of the evening. Will definitely visit again soon
4
The restaurant is housed within an industrial building. It was easy to locate the building but got quite lost when we reached the 6th floor.Setup was simple but it was quite interesting to see how close it was to "nature". I wonder why there aren't any monkeys.Food wise it was normal. Seafood is fresh and pricing is reasonable. Won't say the same for the pricing of the vegetables though.Place is busy and reservations is definitely required. I would return if I need to have a seafood feast
1
i had made the reservation prior 2 months in advance for family dinner, as we had a few kids therefore i called them to request for a indoor table, and even a few days earlier i call to confirm for the availability of the indoor table, as i had experienced insect bite there so i try to avoid it with children, but when i reached there i was given a outdoor table, true enough my kids and myself got bitten, and the staff there inform they can't do anything as there is no more indoor table available. Aside from the table matters, my fried rice came with a crush lottery paper at the side which look like a decoration, after informing the staff there they exchange us a new plate, i am not sure if it is really a new plate either, next is the garlic baked crab, the crab is spoilt there is a very bad smell and after informing the staff they change me a new plate as well. Of all these incident there is no apologise from them, when i inform them they just took the plate away and change us a new plate, customer service is really bad, and the food hygenic is in doub
5
This is a seafood restaurant but also famous for steaks. Beef steak is very nice and reasonable. Beef steak is served with beef fat fried rice. This is excellent!
4
Table service was excellent. Servers were informative and helpful. Beef fried rice used to taste better.
5
Been here a couple of time and this round I brought my family here. They definitely enjoy the food and we look forward to our next visit here again!
5
Eye-Wateringly delicious rib-eye, phenomenal black pepper crab. We went as a group of ten hungry adults, and no-one was disappointed. We were there on a Saturday night, and the place was buzzing and packed despite being on the 6th floor of a massive industrial building on Hillview Avenue. Singaporeans know their food, and seem to flock here. I'd imagine tourists might be a bit nervous about making the trek out to Hillview, but if they want to get a genuine experience of real Singapore and great food to boot, then I'd put this up there as a must do. I couldn't recommend this place more. Absolutely loved it
4
New Ubin has done local food with a twist very well for a long while, and even with its shift to a new premises, maintains its standards. I do feel the previous location had a better atmosphere and accessibility though. Service could be a bit more prompt
4
We were there on a Friday evening and the dinner started ok. Great service from the waiter who took our orders. As the crowd comes in, the service became very slow. Waited for thirty minutes for our dessert durian dessert and we had the cancel and reminded them thrice. Finally we had to cancel the order as we could not wait any longe
3
We decided to try out the new location. The similarity is that it resides inside an industrial park, you have to park amongst the trailers, goods vehicles, now you have to take the lift up to level 6. The usual favourites like the satay, Hokkien mee, Angus beef, lamb chops, seafood, all were good. Except the staff were quite pushy to get more exotic seafood on our table, as well as trying to describe which wine we should buy with no idea what wine pairing means. White and sweet wine doesn't go with red meat, although it certainly is smooth to drink. Simple meal, but overpriced. We can get something better for the price we paid elsewhere
2
Went for family dinner of 4 and had the following comments:1). The booking system is excellent, easy and hassle free through online or sms/Whatsapp. They even have a reminder and confirmation again a day before the dinner.2). The services is good, fast and friendly. The food comes out fast as well.3). However, quite disappointed with the limited options for the food to choose from. There are both Chinese and Western food but if you are going purely for Chinese Tze Char, there are limited variety. The name Seafood Restaurant is kind of diluted with Western food mixed into it.4). The food is not as tasty as expected, even their signature dish for the crab is below average. 2 of the dishes among all that we ordered were Chili crab (don't have that "Omm" factor) and also their signature Garlic Crab (not much taste & quite plain).The rest are just normal and not worth mentioning.5). Price is slightly on the high side but I will not complain if the food is really good.Overall, we are not impressed. Unless they improve on the quality of their food and more variety (concentrate on the real Tze Char please!!), I'll will not recommended it

If finding free parking is your thing and good local Singaporean cuisine you want to savour. This place not only brings you the usual suspects (Seafood like Chilli Crab, Satay, Oyster Omellete), it has been including the best in West, Indian and again a MUST TRY is the Angus beef, cooked to perfection that all you need is the sea salt and mustard. It comes with fried rice and chips but ask for medium done.) Other stuff that is really good - Pork Knuckles, Satay, BBQ Ribs. I had the pleasure of having Mr Pang join our table and he hosted us to his history and hospitality. A true restaurant owner who shared his views of what good food should be about and how the food when served tells him what is the state of the kitchen. My guests from HK and UK enjoyed the evening except we had no more space to try the desserts. Overall I would rate all food to be above average and you WILL enjoy the generous use of spices and good cooking. It's a casual eating place so shorts and T shirts is fine. Please make reservations and be on time

The New Ubin Seafood Restaurant mved from Sin Ming to 63 Hillview Avenue industrial building 6th floor. Trip Adviser need to change the address.Location and ambience I prefer the Sin Ming. There were inadequate signage to find the restaurant and I am not sure why there is a "Canteen" signage at the restaurant.At Hillview I must say I enjoy the cool wind. However the tables and chairs were placed so closed I hear clear conversation of diners. I could even reach out to the next table and grab a crab claw. Getting out of your seat is near impossible without knocking yr diners around you.Food taste less exciting, there is no meat flavour in the steak, Rice that comes with the steak is cold and too oily. I tired their garlic crab, nice flavour but lack the garlic intensity.I hope they would work on increasing their flavour, more exiciting menu and review the seating arrangements.I would still go back for another try some time
4
Their new location was a little hard to find and far away from town. However, the food is consistently good and did not disappoint!
3
Dinner with friends in their new location. Food was so good when i first visited them in Sin Ming but can't say the same this time. Let's hope they work on maintaining their standard or they will lose their customers.
5
Service staff were attentive and environment was great for catching up over a wonderful meal. They also have high chairs for your toddlers!
5
Try the chilly crab and bamboo clam. Inexpensive and good portion and lovely food.
Angus rib eye steak is yummy for a sea food joint.
5
We booked a table for 5, and overall the food was good, service staff was attentive and thoughtful, taking into consideration our pax to order the beef for us. On that topic, order the beef! It is awesome :)
5
Food was excellent as usual and the service staff Wee Teck and Ting Ting were attentive and gave good recommendations.
4
Food was nice. Service was good. Restaurant provided 2 wine glasses each for our wine tastings. Aircon temperature in the room of 4 tables was just right so that food didn't turn cold quickly.
3
Atmosphere: Impressed and relaxing. The place allowing bigger group to dine in.Location: Considering OK, as within 2KM radius from DTL - Hillview MRT. Free parking for those driving.Food: MUST try their signature beef, but I tried and sad to say reaching standard level. Yet to have a try on their crab.Price: A bit expensive generally
3
New ubin may be previously known as a tze char stall however judging the price it charges, it's been escalated to a restaurant category minus the restaurant ambience. The promo of bamboo clam promo - Buy 2 get 1 free is not worthy as the $10 clam is small
5
They have moved to a new location, but they have not lost any of the quality of their food. We were a very large group of over 20 adults and kids, and they managed us extremely well. Food flowed smoothly, and everything we ate was top notch. The meat platter and heart-attack rice are devine! Mussels, prawns and Chilli-Crab all great. The house recipe for slipper lobster is also a must try. Best of all is the staff who are extremely friendly and accommodating. Do not worry about the location: it is all about the food
3
Food was decent and good, but the heart attack rice was not as nice as it taste so bland and not worth the calories. Prices of the food are on a slightly higher rate, will come here once in a while next time.
4
Love their signature beef steak as well as their chilly crabs, oyster egg. Their molten lava dessert with vanilla ice cream was mouth watering.
5
Salted egg and black pepper crabs are a win. For staples, you have to try the Boss Bee Hoon. If you're feeling adventurous, check out the foie gras egg. Steak is a must.
4
I preordered the xxl crabs, oysters, caribinero prawns, lobsters. All were delicious. Only thing is the deep fried prawn rolls were bot as great as I wished. The lobster soup was surprisingly tasty. Great job!
3
I have been to Ubin Seafood at their old Son Ming location but since they relocated to Hill View. We opted for the set menu plus a steam fish. The froie gras with half boiled egg was average. The froie gras could have been seared a tad more. The steak was decent. Steam fish was pretty average. But the fried rice was a let down to me. Overall $285 for 3 which included 2 jugs of beer.
4
Visited for second time (new location at Hillview) recently and was not disappointed. Skipped the grilled foie gras because of an indifferent first experience but went instead with their "recommendation". This included fish roe with sambal petai & cincalok, satay, seafood mee goreng, kailan, oyster omellete (crispy exterior with plump oysters) chilli crab and crispy baby squid. I was impressed with my first try of fish roe presented in such delicious mix of flavor and texture – especially with the piquantly marinated petai. And because enough has been written about the rest, i'll skip mentioning them, save for their passing the test of my rather fastidious makan kakis (aggregating seven).As we rolled out of the restaurant, we heard that Indian food is also available in another part of the same site. Guess that will be left to another day to tell the tale
3
The quality of food is still there even after they had moved from their previous location, Sin Ming. But the quality of service is rock bottom, especially so for those few Chinese (maybe China) staff. I have nothing against Chinese staff because I received fabulous from some of them from other restaurants but those in New Ubin Seafood really lacks training. One was reluctant to explain the set menu, the other ignored our request for cut chilli and another simply dropped me a "I can't find your birthday cake" statement. The whole experience was saved by the good food and a young server who searched for our cake (otherwise I would had to go into the kitchen and look for it myself).
3
When New Ubin Seafood Restaurant was located at Sin Ming, the beef served on wooden board and the fried rice that goes with it was our favourite and it was really served steaming hot and tasty. It was with great anticipation when we visited the relocated restaurant at Hillview. However our beloved beef was not as before. What a letdown The Chilli Crab was also not up to mark! By the time the buns arrived, the Chilli Crab has already turned cold and it's really not appetising dipping the buns into the cold Chilli Crab gravy! I don't think I will visit this restaurant again unless I decide to give it another chance.
4
Was disappointed that I could not get a table with air con even though I made a reservation more than 24 days in advance. Food was good as usual. It is a choice for me to bring friends or family members who have yet to try unique cze char with western cuisine.
4
When my son suggested that he wanted a hearty meat meal, my first thought was New Ubin Seafood. I had wanted to try out this place for awhile but never got to do it when they were still located at Sin Ming. When they moved to Hillview, I put off the idea even further as the new location is just too far from where I am. But when the son wants to eat, the mom would do anything to please, most usually. The distance we travelled was all worth it. Of course we ordered the Angus steak, medium. It was cooked to perfection - taste, tenderness and the right doneness! The steak came with fried rice as part of the deal - we all thought it tasted more like Claypot rice. Rice was coated with dark sauce and it had bits of dried meat which we believed was Chinese dried sausage. But it was all good. No complaints even though it didn't taste like fried rice at all. We also had foie gras on top of volcano egg, fried kailan and lamp chops. The foie gras was cut a little too thick and tasted livery. A little strong tasting for my liking, however the volcano egg was oozing with goodness. The fried kailan was an interesting concept although it sounded plain jane. It was topped with some seaweed bits and fried dry style. A style which we normally wouldn't have thought would work on kailan. The lamp chops were really yummy - they grilled it again with the right tenderness and juiciness and the meat was treated so well that there was only very little hint of lamp taste. We enjoyed our meal so much that went on to tabao (takeaway) fried Hokkien prawn Mee, Mee goreng and prawn paste chicken wings for dinner that same day. They were all good - tasted like good o' Tze char dishes should. This new location, I believe has larger capacity to seat more people and is a lot more airy and comfortable than the old location which I hear was quite cramped. However the setup is a canteen so there is no aircon. Be warned. Service was attentive despite it being a Tze char stall. What's most important, my son loves the food and is extremely satisfied that his meat cravings was addressed. The restaurant offers 15% discount for NS men dining there. I think the owner must have a lot of respect for our NS men. The restaurant even have old photos of soldiers and a book called "From Boys to Men" at the entrance. Too bad, my son forgot to bring his 11B card

Ordered the beef steak with fried rice. The beef steak is good but kind of pricey for a zhi char dinning.
5
Excellent food.. beef n lamb was awesome!!! Definitely will return.. very rare can u BYO n not get charged for corkage...

Great time in Singapoore with delicious seafood what i expect. Associate are very courteous. Enjoyed lots. Thanks to waiter to give us a nice service.

Come here if you are up for comfort food that is unapologetically greasy but mostly big on flavour. The menu should probably be described as eclectic. It features perennial tze char favourites like sweet and sour pork and fried rice but also rather unexpectedly (for me), steak and spaghetti carbonara.The stir fried dishes have good "wok hei" (literally breath of the wok). It's can probably be described as the flavour imparted to food from cooking with a well seasoned cast iron wok. This is the holy grail of stir frying. What we ate:1. Foei gras with onsen egg2. Pork satay (a little too fatty for me and could do with more time on the grill for proper char)3. the signature steak and heart attack fried rice (the steak was decently tender and cooked medium rare. The fried rice made with steak drippings was delicious and had good wok hei)4. Boss bee hoon (another dish with great wok hei)5. Spaghetti carbonara (served up bubbling away in a claypot. There is about 100x more sauce than the traditional Italian version. Tasty, not too cheesy)6. Durian penyet (delicious durian served warm with coconut milk; portion could be bigger)7. Molten chocolate lava cake (good for those who really like a lot of chocolate oozing from their chocolate cake)Much has been said about the poor quality of the toilets. Do remember that the restaurant essentially occupies space carved out from the 6floor car park of an industrial building from the 1970s. The layout is therefore a slightly odd U shape with the regular tables placed along what looks like a corridor that wraps around part of the building. On the whole, this is a satisfying tze char experience if that's what you are looking for. Be warned though that the food is pretty greasy and heavy. Our dinner including one beer and two glasses of lime juice totalled about $180 for three people. That's on the high side for a tze char.

This place has moved from its previous premises at Sin Ming, moving into a larger area twice its size. Food is still consistently good, with the popular favorites the steak, garlic crabs, and boss beehoon. Recommend to make reservations before coming down, and reconfirming them a day before, as his place can get pretty crowded. There are a few tables seated inside the aircon rooms, while the rest are open air

Visited this restaurant after hearing good reviews.We managed to secure a reservation on a Tuesday evening.We ordered 500 grams of Augus beef, Kai lan, fried egg plant ,2 sticks of foie gras satay, black pepper crab, egg omelet and KL fried thick noodles.The beef came with 'heart attack' black fried rice, made from beef lard and potato wedges.The beef was succulent but the rice was a huge disappointment.There is hardly any taste in it.Potato wedges were crispy but flavourless.For S$75 on this dish, I was not impressed.We ordered 2 sticks of foie gras satay just to try, I have tasted better foie gras, it was not seared at a high enough heat to give it a crisp outside.The Kai lan veg dish was okay, nothing fanciful.The fried egg plant was probably was the worst, it's crispy, between sweet and sour.More like a beer accompaniment than a dinner dish.Totally disaster.Pepper crab 800 grams priced at S$58, it was good but I have tasted better.We had 2 mugs of beer, 2 coconut and a soft drink.The total bill came to S$276.For that price, I easily could find somewhere better to have dinner.Out of a party of 5, only 1 said he will come back for the beef. The rest agreed this place is over priced, over rated.I do not recommend this place.One trip advisor mentioned it was a Michelin star restaurant, how it got its star, beggars believe.They is absolutely no ambience, miserable looking staff, dirty toilets. I do not have 1 good thing I remembered from my visit.If you are looking for good seafood, you are better off finding one along the east coast seafood stretch
5
My friend's family took us here and it was by far one of our best meals in Singapore. Not fancy, but just a great selection of different foods. Great presentation and each dish mouth watering. Casual dining but I would certainly go with a business colleague
4
This is one of several casual eateries that have been awarded a Michelin star. The food is good - even by the standards of a great country where almost everyone lives to eat - and where most social conversations involve talking about food!Before I comment on the food, I would point out some serious negatives that really should be addressed as a matter of urgency by the operators of this restaurant:1) The toilets are disgraceful. Not only is there no handicapped toilet (which I thought was a legal requirement!?), but the (men's) washroom has 2 squat toilets and only one sitting. To add insult to injury, these were wet and not particularly clean when I visited this evening.2) Notwithstanding the ceiling and pillar fans, it was tremendously warm – uncomfortably so – because there is no air-conditioning.3) For a relatively pricey (though decent value) eatery, there is no Wi-Fi. This is a particular problem in view of the fact that quite a few diners were foreigners (or visitors) who may not have 4G connection.The gentleman serving us throughout our meal, was most attentive and professional. However, they should train their counter staff to smile as some looked bored and unfriendly.Now to the food. The 8 of us (including three kids) had: - Foie Gras (duck liver) satay - melt in the mouth yummy - at a very reasonable S$7.50 per stick- US Rib Eye steak cooked medium rare (very good; 600 g for $84), which came with fried potato wedges and a very nice fried rice (cooked in beef stock and dripping, I think)- Hong Kong Kai Lan (vegetable) which was just slightly above average ($13, small but adequate for all of us as we were quite stuffed – over ordered)- Their crab and slipper lobster $84 promotion - 2 medium-size crabs cooked (optional) differently + 2 slipper lobsters. For the crabs, we chose 2 contrasting styles: butter cream and black pepper. The lobster was cooked dry in salted egg yolk. While the crab dishes were pretty decent, there are many places in Singapore that serve much better crab. The slipper lobster was just "so so" and really nothing to write home about!- Yang Chow fried rice ($8 for a portion that's quite adequate for 3)- Fried Hokkien prawn noodl - very nice ($26 for a large plate)- Chilli crab sauce ($5; for dipping the Man Tou in) - Deep fried Man Tou ($1 each - we had 8)For desert, we ordered a small traditional Yam paste with stewed ginkgo nuts ($10 serving three) and a Durian Pengat (warm fresh durian paste served with thick coconut milk; $5 for a single portion). These were delicious - but unlike some (and I cannot understand why!), I adore good durian.For drinks (besides plain water served without charge), we had fresh lime juice ($2.20 each) and Asahi draft beer ($7 for 330ml) and Chinese tea ($1 per cup).Summary: We had heard great things about this restaurant from friends who are true food connoisseurs. Regrettably, we left feeling a bit underwhelmed.
4
We patronized this restaurant a few times when they were in Sin Ming. Yesterday, my family went to their new location for a birthday lunch. They maintain the same decor and set-up. We ordered many dishes and they were all delicious. The service staff was helpful and the food was promptly served. They have an excellent reservation system. My wife who made the reservation received an sms asking about our experience through a short survey. We especially enjoy their beef steak although it came medium raw without asking our preference. We normally like medium well
4
Had the foie gras on stick which we prefer more than the one with egg. And the US Angus beef was very good. Hard the Orh Chien fried with egg, but that was bad. Dessert had the molten lava with vanilla ice cream and banana gula melaka with coconut icecream, both very good to end the meal. Will be back, but sticking to a few dishes
5
Greeted with warm and friendly staff,
My 3rd experience with 2 visits and 1 food delivery
Excellent and definitely recommend to friends.
3
Food is cold and probably I am the early customer where they had prepared most of the popular dishes in advance. Standard is by far worse than the first time I ate. Please maintain the food quality please
5
The ambience and environment brought me back to my childhood days' of outdoor dining, loved it. Thanks.
4
Very good to feel Singapore local atmosphere. Staffs are freindly and food is delicious while all of them are very reasonable. Must try the beef and lamb. Not easy to access but I want visit again.
4
Came here for chilli crab. Was sensational. Eccentric location in a multi-storey car park but that doesn't make the food any less delicious. Definitely not a fancy atmosphere.
2
Food was very salty .
Beef fried rice was not as good as last time at sin Ming.. now the rice taste like just dark soya sauce. All the fishes standard drop and all the food are salty..
5
A very unassuming atmosphere- portable tables and chairs with tented roof on part of the building. BUT really great food. This is truly a hidden gem if you like a hawker atmosphere with superb food. Do not think that you can just turn up and get a table- reservations are really necessary.
4
Ordered the wrong crab!Ordered garlic baked crab instead of pepper crab because I just couldn't remember which one I should order. Luckily it turned out fine. Meat was tender and sweet. Roe was a bit hard though.Also had Hokkien mee (noodles) and that was not bad but not great.Crispy baby squids were excellent. They have a coating of sweet black sauce over them
4
ordered our fave steak and fried rice, somehow the steak didnt taste as good as when we had it at sin ming. it wasn't bad, but just didn't taste as good as we remembered. perhaps the steak was too lean and fat less..however the fried rice was just as amazing.we had the hokkien mee too and it was delicious. har cheong gai and sotong was ok. overall still a pretty satisfying meal, will go back because of the steak and fried rice
4
The food at New Ubin seafood is good, especially the beef & fried rice. The ambient is acceptable for family gathering. A bit crowded. The restaurant is pretty popular and I used Chope to book the restaurant a week in advance. However, it limited our dining time to 1.5 hrs only, which we can't sit and chat longer.
5
Both the food and services is very good, the service people there are able to recommend us the food and give suggestion, the food is serve promptly. Super like the Wagyu beef.
4
Went there for the wagyu beef. It's great! Well cooked and love it paired simply with salt. The rest of the food wasn't as great but the highlight was the beef
3
Food is good but expensive. The restaurant atmosphere is average. Could be better. Anyway is a good restaurant for the whole family.
4
Great food. Worth going again. This is my 4th time there and the food standard is great. Our family & friends enjoyed their meal there too.
3
Food quality doesn't taste as good like last time. Limited timing seating doesn't appeal to us. Food seems not hot enough.
4
Good food to accompany the great occasion. The beef and lamp chop were excellent. Best of all is the BYO policy.
5
We've been dedicated fans of Nee Ubin Seafood for some time and used to patronise their Sin Ming Industrial Estate. Their food has been consistently awesome and I always look forward to their specials. Last night it was Mussels with garlic and white wine sauce and Durian Creme brûlée- both Super yummy!Must orders: fois gras with soft boiled egg - amazing combination, beef steak with beef fat fried rice - to die for, Hor fun - wok hei heaven, Kai Lan cooked 2 ways - cooked just right!An awesome meal every single time
3
We ordered N-King Crab and it was not so fresh, we returned the dish and got it written off, and they compensated with a small or-ni (yam) desserts. Other food like Hokkian Mee, salted fish fried rice, petai, all are up to standard. Will come again but doubt will order crab...
3
Table not ready when reached. Need to wait for another 15mins. The person who took order, did not take down all the order, miss out on the green tea and hotplate tofu. The beef steak is really good. Do not order the butter crabs it was not nice at all, milky and cheesy, i cannot taste the butter.The chilli crabs was alright. The garlic crabs is the best among the 3. Probably under staff as well as all the staff look so busy. Overall i have better experience the previous time i cam
3
Would recommend for diners in the west looking for competent and somewhat innovative cze char food. Classic dishes like steamed fish and eggplant were well executed. Food is served at a timely pace but service staff could be better.The ambiance of the new space is certainly better and ultimately, this is a decent spot for competent cooking
4
The food is good and the service is excellent. Special mentioned to Yvonne for the attentive service.
5
We had been to Sin Ming several times and most of the group hasn't been to the new location.
Food was generally good though we noticed a slight inconsistency.
Overall a food place to have zhi Char without paying over the top.
Recommended.
5
This restaurant moved from a well known location recently and I'm glad to see the new operation still lives up to previous fantastic standard.
5
Staff was friendly, service was prompt, food was impressive and costly as always. Would return here.
4
This place serves good old fashion sea food and other stir fried dishes which grew up with many of us.
Service is prompt.
No marks for ambience.
Recommended.
4
If the place will be big enough then this will be a 5 star rating. I will like to recommend the Steak.
5
Had the signature dishes - ribeye, black pepper crabs, etc. superb taste and quality. Will definitely be back!
4
Great place for gathering with friends and awesome food. Especially the steak which was prepared excellently.
3
Making reservations with chope was a breeze, locating the restaurant was easy peasy, parking was plentiful...and free! We were seated quickly, food ordering was mater of fact....no questions asked nor were any recommendations provided. This was a pity as we were there for the first time and it would have been nice if the servixe staff suggested some favourites to us. The service staff was professional and polite but despite the fact few tables that were occupied, their attention was a little difficult to get, when we wanted to make orders, add orders....and even to pay the bill. Food quality wasn't something that would make me travel to eat, neither was the experience something that was special enough to draw me back. Would I recommend it? Perhaps only if you are in the area and are looking for zhi char for dinner and are willing to pay a little but more for your food and ambience
2
I finally managed to get a lunch slot last week for lunch to celebrate my daughter's birthday.But the whole affair was disappointing.Service was slow even for a less than 50 percent capacity crowd .Food quality was only so-so but the quantity apart from one dish was dismal especially the 2 salted soft shell crab which must come be from a midget variant.Definitely the last time I will eat here
5
Food was fresh and tasty. Recommendations made by staff was good! Promotions offered was worth the money.
4
Reasonable prices for good food! Lots of free parking too! Reservations were easy to do as well as pre-ordering the XL chilli crab.
4
We all enjoyed the delicious dishes, the beef there is one of the best that we gave tasted, my sister will flys in every 2 years from Canada and this is one place that she must have the beef and the traditional hokkien noodle.
5
We arrived 10 min before our reservation time and were promptly brought to our table. Service staff was friendly and attentive. Overall experience was good.
4
Tried some of their recommended dishes but only found their crabs and pork knuckles worth trying. However their har cheong gai and orh luak was very average much to our disappointment. Staff were friendly and our order came pretty fast.
4
This place has a definitely better ambience than the previous outlet at Sin Ming. Most dishes were slightly above average. The best dish would be the Garlic Baked Crabs and Steak. With the ongoing buy 2 get 1 free promo, the crabs are a must have!
4
First visit to this restaurant. It was packed! Signage was not very clear, which has canteen written on it. Have been recommended to try their angus beef and fried rice. Ordered medium rare and found it too chewy... The fried rice was good but I prefer Japanese garlic fried rice which is more fragrant. The best dish we tried was the salt and pepper squid which was tender and juicy. The prawn paste chicken is just average. The food was generally tasty, though the price is on the high side.
5
It was my first visit after they move to Hillview. We ordered garlic crabs and steak and the jap big cockles . The steak is very juicy and tender it is one of the must order dish and it come with fried rice. First try of the garlic crabs and it was not disappointing at all.
4
Good innovative food. Really enjoyed the hokkien mee and bee hoon. Would definitely recommend them. Price wise it's about 50% more expensive then other similar restaurants. It's also quite warm in the afternoon and the aircon room has limited seating. Felt the beef was a little overrated. Salted egg soft shell crab wasn't great either. Would come again. Free parking which was a plus.
4
Food was very good.Our booking was for 11am on a Sunday. When we arrived at 11am, the restaurant was not ready to admit guests. Even after we were brought to our table, we were kept waiting, and had to ask for menus. If the restaurant is able to sort these issues out, I would give them 5 star ratin
5
Food was amazing; Although the location was further then the previous one but the quality of the food served certainly made it worth while.
4
The service staff was young, friendly, made good recommendation and honest. Food was great. The beef was delicious
4
Overall d dining experience was quite gd for food & services! But it was surprise dat their Beehoon serving on has 1 size... which jus enough for 2 or 1 for big eater... ::)
4
Service generally good but reserved seats were not great. Had to request for a change of seat cos the receipts were running down at the side of our table.
4
New venue has more seats. Food comes quickly & service was prompt & good as before. Angus still oh so good, crab was fresh & sweet, food was perfect. Space between tables are cramp. It's not really an inexpensive dinner venue, so diners would like to hang around abit to chat & being able to unintentionally overhear the entire conversation of the next table made it uncomfortable.
5
New Ubin Seafood has become one of our favourite places to go since they moved to Hillview Avenue.The favourite chilli crab with fried mantou or salted egg yolk crab are still great. My kids even eat vegetables when served the HK kai lan. The highlight for us, however, is their Black Angus ribeye served with heart-attack fried rice. Priced by 100gms, the steaks are cooked medium and served with caramelised onions and wedges. Paired with their famous heart-attack fried rice (essentially rice fried with beef lard), it is not a meal for the faint hearted... literally... They are not as easy to find these days perched inside the carpark on Level 6 of the Lam Soon Industrial Building, but this new location provides plenty of parking compared with their old location amongst the car repair shops of Sin Ming. Just drive up the car park ramp and head for the Canteen. If you like surf and turf, this is the place to go. Bring friends so you can order a variety of food. Can't go wrong.
4
The place was nice. Food was also really nice. Overall experience was good. Will go again. 4 star because when I was there they seem to forgot my pre-order food, even after 3 to 4 time reminder. The pre-order food came in 30min after all our other "normal dishes" that was ordered there. Should not pre-order food be faster?Maybe they were very busy that day and had miss communication.
3
The services was a little slow due to CNY period I guess. We had a post CNY lunch and the food sequence was wrong. Yu Sheng came right in the middle of the sequence of dishes and by then the table is all filled. Waiter attending us was helpful, but unfortunately he is not able to address our queries in most instances, and he shuttled between us and his manager almost for each question we raise on the food choice
5
Located in a sleepy industrial building, you'd never think New Ubin seafood had moved here (should it now be known as New New Ubin Seafood instead?). But yes, it is here, just a short drive up the ramp to the 6th floor. The food is just as good as it was (beef steak with heart attack fried rice), and it's crowded even on weekdays, so you might want to make a reservation. Worth coming for
3
It was overall a good experience however the slow service at times due to the huge crowd there was annoying. Ordered a bowl of rice and repeated our orders to 4 different servers before we were served and when that happened, we have finished most of the dishes. However, the food served there tastes great
4
First visit after moving to hillview, easily overshoot as a bit dark at the entrance of Lam soon building. Overall good.
3
As expected the specialty Angus Beef ribeye was nice and tender. it was a bit pricey. Service was good. However the oyster omelette was disappointing, egg was overly fried and there were only 4 pieces of oyster.
4
Business is GOOD!!!
Be ready to wait...but food is definitely worth the wait!
Black angus ribeye beef is a MUST TRY! Signature meat platter is good too...
5
Everybody was contented with the food. New union seafood will never disappoint you. Every dishes was just YUMMY!
5
I am surprised this place is in industrial area canteen by day. The food menu are local and western. I ordered angus beef and it was good. The price is reasonable too.
4
Food is good but very pricey. And most tables are non-AC. Promotion buy 2 crabs get 1 free is pretty good and u get to try 3 different Flavours! Great value.
4
I'm amazed this place is in the canteen of industrial area. The food here is simply mouth watering. Good value as well. I tried angus beef and was fantastic.
4
My 2nd visit. 1st visit was at sin ming. I find the new location is much more spacious than at sin ming.
4
Steak lived up to its reputation! Har cheong gai also very good. Lovely meal with friends though slightly pricey
4
The service staff were all very friendly and prompt, I love the decoration of the place with the led lights all above, makes the place look very lovely. The food was mostly good, but the crab dish was so so and the Boss Bee hoon was not that spectacular as well, guess it's not their specialty for crab
5
Sumptuous meal! Great food and service! However, it was a little pricey. Be reminded to make reservations in advance if you don't want to wait.
4
😍chilli crab n angus steak! Awesome for group gatherings so you could try out the diff dishes. Love the fried rice that came with the seafood... fried with pork lard. Must try
5
The reservations via chope was so easy and follow up from the restaurant staff was excellent. The service by the staff-Angeline was good and good was fantastic! Not my first time and will never be the last!
4
Great seafood place which we visited got a farewell dinner got a colleague. The chilli crab was huge and extremely fresh
5
Booked through Chope. Easy app to use. Food is nice especially. The staffs are very friendly. Highly recommended.
5
Reservations had to be made at least 2 weeks prior, but the food was great with reasonable waiting times (:
4
Dishes were great overall with the portions being just nice. The beef was really tender but it is pretty pricey. Will recommend others to visit!
1
Food was cold when served. Over rated restaurant. Will never go back again. I was utterly disappointed.
4
The beef was good , comes with fried rice and chips, the fish roe with recommended sauce was nice.... .... easy to park , quite crowded, should do booking in advance
2
Booked a table for 5pax but was given a table for 4pax. After 10mins, came a family of 4 but was given a table of 6. I asked the staff and they just shoved it away as they were not in charge of reservations. Very bad in handling customers feedback.. Staff was not familiar of the menu either. Wanted to order a small Yusheng for 4-6pax to Lohei but they only have one standard size which costs $68. I asked what is in the yusheng as it's not in usual market price of $30+ but the staff has no idea and they was no picture or brochure of the yusheng at all so we didn't order as we had absolutely no idea what is in this expensive yusheng. Big disappointment as it was my family CNY reunion dinner. Will never go back again
4
My first time to visit New Ubin Seafood after moving place. They still maintain the atmosphere and taste.
5
Good services provided by the staffs and the food is served promptly upon order. The food is of quality and my family having a great lunch.
4
Promotional Crab was value for money. Pepper Crab must try. Environment was something different from the usual chi cha shops
5
I you want gourmet food at a reasonable price, new Ubin is the place to go! Quality food and efficient staff
5
Although the shop moved to a new location, the food and customer service is still excellent! Will definitely patronise again.
4
Location is in the canteen of an industrial building and it could be difficult to find. Seafood was very fresh and well cooked but also more expensive than many places.
4
Food was ok. But pricing is a bit on the high side. The atmosphere was average. Service has been great.
3
New Ubin Seafood Restaurant has recently shifted from Sin Min Road to near Hillview area. The restaurant is located in an industrial building called Lam Soon Industrial Building. You can drive up directly to the 6th floor, it is located at an previous Canteen, so if you see signage pointing to the Canteen, just follow it.I have been to the previous location and current location, the current location can seat more diners compared to before. But as per previous location, reservation is a must before you head down here.The last visit was an impromptu decision to order takeaway from the restaurant. We ordered the US Black Angus beef with fried rice, Hong Kong Kai Lan special and You Tiao. The waiting time was acceptable around half an hour. They placed everything in a nice New Ubin Seafood tote bag for us, so we just paid and go. The problem came when we have left 10 mins later, we received a call saying that they have left out the fried rice that was part of the Black Angus beef and asked us to come back to collect it. We were not exactly pleased with this, but we decided to drive back to the restaurant to collect it since the meal would not be complete without the rice.When we reach there, I expected the fried rice to be there waiting for us, but nope. They had to ask the kitchen to cook it then, and so I had to wait again...By the time we reached home, the food was cold. So I can't really say that we enjoyed the food...I believe that due to the bigger restaurant, they had to get many new staff and some of them are inexperienced. So I think a visit to the restaurant needs a little patience.
5
Love the food! The pre-ordered 2.5kg Sri Lankan crab (cooked 2 ways - garlic baked & steamed) and the grilled US ribeye were excellent! Lots of new staff amongst the overall crew working hard to please. Obviously there will be some teething issues resettling the restaurant into a new location which must be at least twice as big as the old restaurant, but one cannot fault the effort made. Most importantly, good to see the food quality is as high as ever!Thanks for another great dining experience & looking forward to my next visit
3
The biggest disappointment was the black pepper crab. It was not anywhere near to an average compared to a few places where I have eaten them.The US Rib beef was excellent as it was one of their House dish. Dou meow was good and we ordered a second helping.I was scheduled to turn up at 8.30pm but changed twice to 9pm and then 930pm due to unforeseen circumstance.They were very accommodating (needless to say there were less crowd ..)and obliged my request.Altogether a satisfying dinner treat for my overseas guests. The decor seems to be transplanted log stock and barrel from their previous Sin Ming outlet
5
Had a good feast at Ubin Seafood. Food was fresh and served on time.
They even gave us indoor seating when we previously thought only outdoor was available.
4
Good food, good and fast service. Suitable for bringing guests for a local experience.
Some may find the prices for the type of food and location on the high end - it is still a dining option worthy to keep on the list.
5
Delicious seafood restaurant which located quite near to my neighborhood. Must try the promo crab with white pepper.
2
food price is more expensive then the coffee shop and the portion of food is small. We ordered the 2 crabs yet they given shortage of the crab. All the food is cool and cold not hot. It means waited awhile before service us.
4
We were brought to our tables without delay and food came 20mins after ordering. Food was fairly good. Took some time to locate the restaurant as it is parked right behind a carpark. Need to improve on the signs.
4
so good, try the steak. Might be the best in SG. Ambiance is a bit strange, being in a parking lot, but also part of the charm.
4
It's probably my 3rd time visiting the new ubin seafood restaurant and the food is still so good. If you haven't been here, do try their steaks; mid rare of course. It's cooked to perfection. Do also try their buy 2 free 1 crab promotion with different flavours. My personal favourite is the salted egg yolk crab. You can also tell that the fried man tou is freshly made. Service here is also good. Must come and eat here at least once in your life time !
3
First, this restaurant is not centrally located in town or near mrt or shopping malls. It is located in an industrial building.It is also not air-conditioned.But it can be a good place to go if you decided not to go to a crowded shopping mall restaurant on a weekend.Food wise is good, we tried the angus beef and it would have been better if it's priced lower. Service is average.
5
Food - fresh, good quality, value for $. Dishes that I enjoyed: chili crab (crab meat was firm and tasty), HK style steamed bamboo clams (fragrant and non-chewy), brinjal (totally did not taste like brinjal), hokkien mee, the fried rice that came with steak, choc. lava cake.Service - although it was New Year's Eve, a busy evening, service staff was attentive and promptAnother big plus - no corkage for wines and whiske
5
New Ubin has moved yet again, this time to an industrial building in the northern part of Singapore - Lam Soon@Hillview. Compared to its old premises, Lam Soon is not as charming and quaint. But the new premises are more spacious, cleaner, have better toilet facilities and ample free parking. New Ubin continues to draw the crowds with familiar favourites like satay, beef, crabs and fried beehoon. But some of New Ubin's best dishes are not on the menu. You will need to ask Mr Pang and Frankie and you will not be disappointed
4
Wide varieties of choices and suit my family who some don't take seafood! Beef and crab were good but not the oyster omelette.
4
Food was great especially the beef ribeye with fried rice. Nice new venue too. Just slightly pricey.
4
An exclusive place to have a meal with friends with good food and service. Will be going back for dinner on 14Jan
4
The signature food for example garlic crab and steak are really good! The oyster egg especially very crispy and the oysters are big and fresh. Very yummy!
5
Lots of greenery around, and easy parking. Food was yummy and corkage is free so you can bring your drinks.
4
Food is great but crab is a bit pricey. Overall, it's a nice place for family gathering. Will definitely come again!
4
Its definitely a gem!! Quality food with awesome service too!! Still got many dishes not tried, will be back soon!
4
I would have preferred if the restaurant would have a dial in where I can talk to someone confirm certain things. eg I was hoping that a prebooking some weeks before would have secured me a place in he aircon room. When I got there, the waiter said that I could have indicated ...which goes to show that he was not aware of the lousy booking system.

This is my first visit to Ubin Seafood Restaurant after hearing so much about their Beef. My comments for the beef is passable only,Furthermore, I really do not understand why should the beef be served in a "Set"? together with the Fried Rice and Potato Wedges. The fried rice is nothing great and the wedges is too dry. I must say that their Chilli Crabs is quite good. It is a pity, we are unable to order and try other dishes on the menu because of the Beef set
3
I have eaten here many times and always enjoyed the good food and reasonable prices for which I was prepared to put up with the indifferent service. In the new place, pros are plentiful free parking, nice view of green. Cons are layout very inconvenient, one Long and narrow space. Seating is uncomfortable and cheap looking. Poorly designed tables that do not allow seats to be properly stacked under and placement of tables means a very cramped experience. Service is worse - condiments were not provided until our meal was almost over, and one dish was served cold and had to be sent back. Food wise, worst of all, not as good as before. Several dishes quite ho hum. Signature ribeye dish still good (but the accompanying potatoes were the dish that came cold). Once that slips I will stop coming.
3
Boss beehoon has chunks of pepper in certain parts... not cooked evenly. No wok hei taste.
Chilli crab's sauce too sweet... but crab is big and fresh.
4
Abit pricy but the crab is great. Will be better if they wash the crabs abit more as I can actually taste and feel the sandy stuff that is stuck onto the crab legs
4
Finally we have a famous and decent seafood restaurant at the west. Great food and great atmosphere. Love it's beef and hearthe attack fried rice.
4
Food is very good and service staff are very attentive and helpful. Venue can accommodate a lot more patrons compared to previous location. However found it a little costly considering location and setting.
4
Was a generally good night at the New Ubin Seafood. Though we had to make a reservation , the procedure was simple we did manage to get a table of our preferred timing. The dishes were served rather quickly and food was good.
5
New location but the same great food! Portions were generous. Took a set meal for 10 although there were 11 people and yet we could not finish the food.
5
Ubin seafood maintains its standard in food quality. Can look through the menu on its website before going.
3
crab was fresh. hokkien mee not as rich in stock as another that I am used to. Masala roe was competent. But I prefer my usual at an indian restaurant. Guess comparison not fair even though it is styled ala marsala.. foie gras satay was edible but had initial smell. overall, i like the rustic ambience. quite rare for a Singapore joint
3
Located in the back of car park on 6 th floor you will find too many western expats in the location. Promo this month was order 2 crab and get 3rd free and each crab costs about $42. We also had the steamed flounder which tasted like cod. Not bad on these 2 dishes.As for the deep fried black sauce prawns it was mediocre and the prawns did not taste very fresh . we had a sweet potato blachan and another side dish the total damage was $194 for 3 of us I didn't have the steak as the reviews were mixed . The crabs were very good . BTW this is not the place for a romantic date but you can impress by order more crabs
4
On top of the standard items (steak, softboil egg with foie gras) we tried their pepper and garlic bake crabs. Crab meat is juicy and the half bake recommended by Chris was really nice!Services are also very good. Location about hidden at the 6th floor carpark. Would be good to have some signages along the main road
4
Very good food especially the beef and satay. A must go. Will definitely go back again to try other dishes.
4
Their signature beef dish was great everyone should come and try! The design of restarurant was interesting as wells
4
Food service pretty fast and it is fresh. As for the service, the staff are attentive and friendly as well.
4
Solid seafood and lovely beef. Get the US beef. Also razor clams are good, but no vermicelli. Cereal prawns are delicious (they can deshell them!). Their new location is hard to find, but go toward the canteen area towards the back of the building.
2
Back again to their new location but was disappointed. - waitress don't know how to take order she keep asking another waitress for help. The other waitress sort of ignore her and ask her to take the order herself. She missed out some order but well, it happen everywhere. - we asked them about the order they missed out and was told got to wait another 20 mins instead of expediting it for us. - The bee hoon, caramelised rice and fried oyster are very oily. - read review that the Mao shan wang durain-boleh dessert is "wow" but was disappointed. It's very watery without much durain taste. - somehow rather still prefer the setting in the previous location. - overall a disappointed experience
4
This restaurant is bang on the money. It is a Zi Char place. It is not a steakhouse. No indeed. But the steak is so unashamedly good.The main event is the US Black Angus ribeye steak served together with sea salt flakes and fried rice caramelized with beef drippings. What’s the steak like? Simply perfect. Affordably priced. A melt-in-the-mouth delight. Its intense, juicy twang – offset by a small pile of caramelized onions and Idaho potato wedges – is an education in how good beef can be.Another lip-smaking items on the menu is the orh chien oyster omelettes with fresh live oysters. The fish roe – deep fried with petai and sambal, served with chinchalok is also chest-thumpingly good. Only item NOT to order is the utterly disgusting salted egg squid.All in, this is a purist’s encounter with beef, and it is as uncomplicated as it is excellent. This is the true truth as I say it as it is
4
Restaurant is located in an industrial building. Parking is ample and complimentary. We had the beef, prawn paste chicken and crab which were all good. The hot plate tofu and spinach w eggs were average. Will revisit to try other dishes. Customer service was good and prompt
5
You won't know an industrial building has such a gem on its Level 6 carpark.NUSR has long been famous when it was in Sin Ming Industrial estate.At the new location, it is more tidy and oresentable.The dishes still taste wonderful If you don't like the trouble of eating their famous crabs, you can still enjoy their beef and beef fats fried rice. Even the usual prawn paste wings are great.Some more plus points, no corkage, no towel charges, quick service
4
We had the pepper crab which was outrageously yummy . It's not cheap - $140 for a large 1.6 kg crab which was enough to feed 7 of us . The "to die fir" ribeye was a tad over salted but the tenderness of the meat made up for it . Oh and the accompanying artery clogging fried rice was superb.The kai Lan was superb as always . I found the crispy brinjals a bit on the sweet side but the others loved it . We also had the French style clams which was good. It came with some pieces of French loaf which was great for soaking up the white wine sauce. The mee goreng was uneventful. We opted to have the pulot hitam dessert which did not disappoint .The place is not cheap . The bill came up to about $60 a head . This included 5 waterchest drinks and 4 beers . The service was faultless.Good dining experience overall 
4
Very yummy zichar with very good service staff. We kept increasing our orders because we wanted more. Ended up with 10 dishes for 5 of us! Wok hei smell for stir fried items and the beef was done very well! The disappointing part was the dessert. Just stick to the zichar food.
2
Ambience vs food quality vs price just doesn't add up. Didn't feel money well-spent. Dessert steals the show. But I'm not going into a cafe ya..
3
The beef this time was fibrous unlike in our previous visits. The other dishes were average. The restaurant will be moving away from our neighborhood. Don't think we will make the effort to travel to the new location.
3
The beef too salty & squid not fresh request take 1 more tomato souce but the waiter forgot. The food come out too fast but the table too small
4
location is not easy to find as it is in an industr zone. cab driver wont know there is a restuarnt there. no air condition but.it.was.not very.hot. quaility of.the.food is.good but a bit expensive. overall happy.with the.dinning experience
1
- poor service
- over-price
- poor environment
- location not the best
- charges service + gst on top of total bill
3
Always been a big fan when they were located at Sin Ming, especially for their wagyu beef and the associated fried rice. Ordered the same dishes this time, but the beef that was served was lukewarm, same for the fried rice. Made us wonder whether the portions were cooked in a large batch and served in smaller portions when ordered. Very disappointing, though flavours were decent.Other dishes like salted egg squid and white wine lala were OK
5
Great service, very authentic vibe. We got the New Ubin Seafood menu for 4 people plus a few extra dishes. See pictures for some of them, great personal favorites of mine were the Black Pepper and the Garlic Crabs. Highly recommended when in Singapore. Worth every minute of the 25 minutes ride from downtown
5
I can't recommend this place enough. It's a bit tucked away and hard to find but once you find it you won't regret it. Most of the restaurant is an outside terrace with circular tables on the balcony. Everyone gets the singapore favorites: Chili Crab and Pepper Crab - which Ubin makes amazingly. But I recommend you get the Baked Garlic Crab: its a whole crab steam baked with dozens of garlic cloves. Everything softens and infuses the Garlic taste in all of the crab meat. You can even eat the soft baked garlic cloves as well. This place is also well known for it's amazing Ribeye steaks that are cut into small bitesized pieces. And the restaurant will fry up the Ribeye fat with rice to make their famous "heart attack rice." It's a harsh name but it is absolutely delicious
3
Went to New Ubin Seafood restaurant in Sin Ming just before they moved to their new place. Read the rave reviews about this place in the local newspapers and decided to round up some friends to go there.We ordered chili crabs, crabs with salty egg, fried brinjal, kai lan, beef, beef fried rice, pork ribs, stuffed you tiao and fried hokkien mee. The beef, beef fried rice and bbq pork ribs were great. The rest of the dishes were average and nothing to rave about. Service was ok but the place was super crowded and difficult to find.Hopefully the ambience will be better in their new venue. We paid about $380 for 8 people. Will come back for the beef and pork ribs but will probably skip the seafood the next time
4
Was there to celebrate my grandson birthday also before they move to hillview.Been there few time find the food oily, taste okay. But my son in law and family like the food also they know the owner.The place is crowded on weekend and is very noisy.Thought crowded our food came quite fast. We have satay. Beef, beef fried rice ( vrt oily very unhealthy) hokkien noodle, fried fish roe,vegetables, raw oyster, some kind of a foe gria with egg,(dont taste like foe gria ) fried you tiao with cuttlefish ,pepper crab and chilly crab.Overall food taste has improve to my surprise. Don't know the cost before didn't pay the bill. So busy but service still good. No wonder so popular
5
Thoroughly enjoyed this restaurant which focuses on serving absolutely divine fresh seafood without all the blabla of sometimes overhyped 'branded' places. Try it out. You won't be disappointed.
4
The food was fantastic as usual and the service was still decent despite the crowd on a weekend! Looking forward to the next time!
4
Food is great though haven't tried the seafood like crabs yet but of CoZ it's in direct relation to costs.
4
Annually we will come to this favourite place of ours (family +++) Even my sister from Canada that visits us every 2 years will request to have one of her dinner here before she goes back home.
1
Slow service by a few new temp staff. Insisted to see all the facebook like for the free drink. Keep chatting among themselves delay the serving of food!
5
The service staff is very attentive and though was told there's another sitting after us but there was no haste and we sat till last order.
4
Close an eye on the price and fill your stomach with goodness! For savoury foodies, this is a must try. Angus beef with fried rice and chilli crab were two of the dishes which made us crave for more~
5
My family and I celebrated my wife's birthday at new ubin seafood. We were given a large table with indoor air conditioned seating. We ordered some of their specialties, including fried crispy brinjal, special hokkien prawn mee, chilli crab, salted egg crab, black pepper crab, fois gra poached egg, U.S. beef platter, prawn paste chicken. Food was served very fast after ordering. Service was good and for some items like rice, noodle; the staff helped is to divide and distribute as well Food quality was good and we found the brinjal very special. Definitely a must tryThe Aunty even gave a cup cake to the birthday girl (my wife).A cake which i brought along was kindly stored for us in the fridge and Aunty helped to light our candles and take photos for us. Even though this was our first visit there(I had previously heard of new ubin from friends), I found the environment to be warm and friendly. Food price was not expensive either as our food for 8 people came up to 300 before gst and service charge. New Ubin will be a recommended destination for us in future
4
The beef is a must try. And the fried rice that comes with it is equally good. Hei Zhou is fantastic as well, crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. They have this ongoing promotion buy 2 get 1 free crab that is reasonably priced. You can choose different flavours for your three crab so this allows you to have variety. Not the best tasting crab around but still very bery affordable for the quality
5
I have been here many times, with my family, with my School buddies from SJI, with my Bike Buddies from Springleaf and more. The Food is exquisite yet very local. The serving portions are good and the presentation is something you will find is good restaurants. For a Chinese Cuisine to serve Foir Gras is unique. The Beef and Lamb is also mouth watering. We usually bring our own Wines and Liquor but they have a good selection too .. ask for the private room...that's where they are "hidden" .... Unfortunately ... This month these Good People are moving to Hillview Estate at the Old Lam Soon Building... please check with them directly on the move.. I am sure its going to be just as good or better ! Have fun !
4
Usually packed place in Sin Ming.
Recommended dishes
Boss Bee Hoon
Grilled Beef
Heart attack Fried Rice
Hong Kong Style Kai Lan
Their Red Wine selection also pretty afforable
Just that the place will be noisy and packed
Strongly recommended to book in advance.
4
A must try are their garlic baked crab, angus steak and special kai lan. We love their food and the ambience. Its a pity they are shifting out of their current place to the west. Hope they could retain their current kampong setup style.
3
Food came extremely fast within 5-10 mins of ordering at one go. The steak was too salty but it was nicely done till medium rare. Seats were cramped and I was constantly knocked into by the servers.
5
Although i did not get my table on time, the staff did try to make sure the food is ready when we alrd seated.
4
Food was good and staff, surprisingly for Singapore our days, very service oriented and with a big smile.
3
The Hokkien Mee & Prawn Paste chicken mid-joint wings were well-flavoured and tasty. Alas the dishes left us unimpressed. The garlic-steamed prawns could be fresher, the boss beehoon was charred and kailan was okay only. Service was prompt and effective.
4
No disappointments here. Third time here and it's very consistent. Crab is arguably better than the steak.
5
Had a great dinner there before they moved away. It's a pity they will be moving to Hillview, where it won't be accessible as now. Nonetheless the food is great, though the cost has gone up over the years, still good value. The staff is good and while it's not a fancy restaurant, it gives you the local eatery feeling with awesome food. Great place
5
This place has probably some of the best food in Singapore. It's not central and not obvious to find, but worth the trip. Must make a reservation... this place is always packed. Chilli and pepper crab are excellent. Service is good, food comes quickly. Price is not extortionate. Highly recommended
5
Had a booking for birthday celebration with friends and the food was amazing to taste plus extremely value for money and they do not stinge on portion size. Definitely go for the 2 get 1 free crab offer when you're there! Chilli crab was super generous w the gravy, order yourselves some fried man tous (which is BIG and worth it) and you can't get enough!
4
Mixture of Chinese and western, this restaurant will give you a new experience when you can eat US beef and Chili crab at the same time!
4
Very nice restaurant but need early booking! Nice and flavourful decor. But Always full, hard to book. Must try their pork knuckles, beef steak - very very nice! Check out also their salted egg prawns.
5
the crabs were totally awesome. along with the beef which was cooked to perfection. the bucket promo is value for money as well
5
Tucked away but so much in the one place. Food great as usual. Garlic baked and black pepper crab amazing. Hope they don't lose some of the experience at the new premises.
5
well, where else can you find the best of all cuisines in a mid-range restaurant setting?!
perfect when i have to please different taste buds in the family
4
We took the Shiok Menu. It was really shiok. There was interesting fusion of foie gura wih poached egg (one each). The beef with fried rice was good! Do not underestimate this dish. The beef was medium rare the way we like and the fried rice taste like claypot rice. Since we were unable to finish we taobao it. The service crew went through the extra mile and told us what is the best way to heat it up to retain the juice. So thoughtful!Dessert please go for the gula meleka caramelized banana with coconut ice cream. The Durian Pengat was interesting. Texture and warm like yam paste but is made of durian.The only reason why I gave a 4 and not 5 is it can be costly. But I believe is due to quality
5
A great night spent over food!Love the Beef and the I name it 'charcoal rice'. Ordered about 4 dishes for 4 of us and portion was just good.The recommended and must order is the US Black Augus Ribeye Steak with Fried Rice, Wedges and Onions. I especially love the Fried Rice and have had a good portion for myself (for someone who don't like rice).Restaurant take in reservation so you don't have to wait (always crowded) and food is served shortly after.Price is slightly above average.Overall, good atmosphere and food is awesome!Cheers,Jazly
4
The beef here for all the 3 times we've come has been the highlight. So succulent and juicy, well worth the price! It was the fastest dish to be wiped out, as usual. Read some reviews that recommended the crabbeehoon soup which was a big letdown! It was left untouched after we all had a taste of the bland soup. Only the crab was sweet...also, the butter cream crab sauce was a tad too thick for our liking. We would go back but definitely will not be ordering any crabs this round
4
Quality of food is excellent. Boss is super nice. But counter service staff is inflexible. An hour into dinner, we (3 pax) bump into 2 friends & ask if they can extend our 1.5hrs so that our 2 friends can join us instead of waiting for their reserved table for 2. Afterall the restaurant can release the reserved table for 2 but they insisted no until the boss came & we explained our coincidence meeting of our friends which he gladly helped us extend.
2
This visit was extremely dissappointing. We had crabs in 3 different flavours. The chilli and salted egg crabs were simply bad. The meat was dry and tough for both and the chilli crab sauce was not its usual full flavoured finger licking good. Although the staff was willi g to replace the dishes we declined. The hokkien noodles too was not at its normal yummy standard. Thankfully the garlic crab saved the day. Atmosphere wise, we chose the airconditioned room which may have been a bad choice as the adjoining table was loud and boisterous and the enclosed space amplified the din.
4
Just one word "good" however, the price is not cheap too. The staff knows their dish well. They can recommend to their best.
4
Not our first visit. When we found out that they are moving, we decided to go before they shift.
Hope the price and standard remains at their new restaurant.
5
While the seafood was also good, the outstanding dish has to certainly be the US Angus steak with the delicious fried rice.
4
Food is really good here. Unfortunately the experience was slightly marred by a pushy order taker who keeps rushing us to place an order, despite the fact that we were there early (at 11.30am) and there was only 1 other table taken in the restaurant.
4
Must try the Angus rib eye steak cubes! Hokkien mee is good too. Vegetables dishes can be improved, ribs were succulent but the sauce was a bit too sweet and overpowering.
4
Wanted to go back to Ubin Seafood again before it moves away from Sin Ming at the end of the month. Ordered our usual favourites but this time, the steak came a little under than our ordered Medium. Other than that, we get our usual high quality seafood fare!
5
The Black Angus beef was up to its usual great standard, perfectly juicy and charred and had the right degree of doneness. Ordered the one-for-one BBQ tiger prawns - great value for fresh and succulent seafood. The Clair de lune oysters were sweet and tasted just like the sea. Chocolate Alexander was the perfect end to the meal
4
Service was prompt and reservation system was advance. it will automatically route you to Chope.com for online booking. Food was more skewed towards fusion style, in contrast to the nostalgic ambience. Only thing was that I was slightly disappointing comparing the food standard here 5 years ago. It was definitely better then
4
This place used to serve good food at reasonable prices. Had dinner there 2 days ago and found that the standard for many of the dishes had dropped significantly.Perhaps because it was a Saturday, the place was super packed. Some of the dishes we ordered were served lukewarm; I suspect they were cooked in advance and in bulk to cater to the crowd. The brinjal delight was very disappointing, they were limp and not crispy as should be. The oyster omelette was oily, soft with only a handful of oysters and overpriced at S$36.The much raved about US beef also came lukewarm and the portion did not appear to be the 600gm that we ordered.The crab dishes were still good and resonably priced with their promotional offer of 1 free crab for every two ordered. Crabs were smallish in size.The other dish that we enjoyed was the prawn paste chicken.The cost of one small bottle of Asahi beer was S$8. Overall the meal was expensive
4
The New Ubin was a place that I had been to before several years ago and did like it. I decide to return on this trip after it was recommended by Michelin. When I made the reservation I was surprised that the person reminded me several times the reservation was only for two hours. I was again reminded of it again when I checked in. We ordered lamb satay which I thought was unusually good for Singapore. I typically prefer the Kajang variety from Malaysia. We ordered the halibut that was outstanding and reasonably priced. The rest of the dishes did not disappoint. Overall I had an excellent dinner. The waitress that served us was particularly funny, pleasant and efficient
5
The Angus beef with fried rice is a must try! Medium cooked is recommended. The fried rice tastes like claypot rice which is great too!
5
Definitely a must try. Different from the usual style of crabs found in Singapore but so good. Good priced wine list as well.
4
Looking for a rustic Singapore food, look no further than New Ubin Seafood. Good selection of seafood, served in the way Singapore like it. Their communal steak is a must try plus their heart attack fried rice. Yum yum
5
The crab was huge and absolutely delicious. My party was a small one (of three), but if you do go in a larger group, the buy 2 crabs get 1 free promo is definitely worth it. The staff there knew exactly what to recommend you, and they sent an SMS before my visit allowing me to pre-order a lobster. Excellent service
4
Place is ideal for whole family relaxed Sunday get together - they have a wide variety of good food from meats to seafood. V fresh and cooked well. Little boost as you can expect with three generation groups. Our fav place for the family. They also allow BYO Wine and they provide wine glasses and ice bucket. Would always recommend friends to come. Service is friendly.
4
We enjoy going to New Ubin Seafood as it is walking distance from home and work.(sad that you are moving soon)All service staff are friendly, very "on the ball ", and remembers their customers. Am thankful for the little bowls of 'sweetness' given to the birthday babies
4
the biggest highlight was that we were unexpectedly given a table in the very limited aircon area - a great bonus since we had a toddler with us, and it was a really warm evening! (though this probably won't happen again, haha). ironically though, the drawback of being in the enclosed aircon area was also that it was far too noisy that evening, with many big groups having boisterous celebrations, a bit overwhelming for our tiny family of 6, but we survived.. overall, staff were accommodating, and the server assigned to our table provided very helpful tips on what to order and was quite attentive to our needs. little touches like a "help yourself" area with free flow water, additional cutlery, napkins etc were great, makes everyone's life easier especially during peak dining hours. food was served very fast, altho maybe slightly TOO fast because with everything on the table, some got cold quite quickly; but i guess that's how they manage to have faster turnaround for the next seating. but for the price, it's decent value for your money, so can't complain too much also. glad we managed to visit just before it relocates
5
Hidden behind work shops panel beaters would never know about the restaurant if it wasn't for a friend that lives in Singapore. Very unique casual dining lot of locals eat here, and now I know why the food is fantastic. They have great wine selection, but you can take your own.If you're on a budget or want to eat with the locals this place is a must
1
Made reservations for 5 persons for lunch on Sunday and upon arrival only had 3 sets of cutlery. Service staff was told twice to bring the cutlery. Dishes were served in a disorderly manner, the cold crabs which is usually served first ended being the last dish to arrive. The Angus beef steak, fries and fried rice were served separately and different intervals, the fried rice is disappointing (it used to tastes much better)Tried to get service staff attention for the longest time to get tools for the cold crab, but to no avail. No one came over to the far end to check whether tables require service.This will be the last time I am bringing my family to New Ubin Seafood. This restaurant is now BANNED
4
Be prepared to wait up till 20-25mins for your table despite your reservation. My reservation was at 7pm and I got there about 7.05pm. Table was still occupied when I reached. We didn't get seated till 7.25pm. Fortunately the dishes didn't take too long. For families with young children, do take note (in case they are starving). Food is good. Will definitely visit again
5
It was a hassle-free experience! Fantastic arrangement. The restaurant has provided us a good table for a relaxed dining experience.
4
Tourist whom are seeking for local delicacies are in for a treat! This is one of the few good restaurants which has a local feel which located right in the heartlands. Cant get more local than this.
4
Easy and convenient to make reservations, good and quality food and fast service. Overall satisfied.
3
An hour prior to my reservation I received an SMS from the restaurant touting limited quantities of oysters and mussels. I placed an order for the mussels when I arrived at the restaurant only to find that that those served were not fresh. The saving grace was that the restaurant took the item back to their kitchen and off my bill
5
We ordered the crab in 3 different variations, salted egg, black pepper and the original chili crab. The last one was by far the best one, the taste of the chili sauce is just amazing. Order some of the fried or steamed buns with the crab and just dip them into the delicious sauce
4
The Rib Eye steak and Fat fried rice combo is definitely reccomended.The fresh oyster can be more succulent in my opinion. Which is also the most lack lustre dish from the 2pax set meal we had ordered.The Foie Gras & Poached Egg entree was different. Dishes were served quite promptly.And the floor staff gave reccomendations and opinions on how the steak should be done / and desserts to order. Which was nice. The HK vegetable special was good!And the desserts (depending on what you have picked), was served casual but relatable to our local palate.We picked the Alexander Lava Cake woth Vanilla Bean Ice Cream. And Gula Melaka Banana and Coconut Ice Cream. Be prepared for a satisfying meal for two! :
4
Hidden within an industrial area lies a restaurant that resembles a village style theme. Went with my kids and they love it. Nice steaks and noodles. Beware, that the steak comes with a huge plate of black rice.Overall, nice place to have a lunch or dinner.
3
Our family of 8 went for a sunday lunch 2 weeks back and I wasn't specially impressed. Yes, the foie gras and the angus beef steak was good, but isn't this a seafood restaurant? We ordered 3 cooking style of crab (chilli, salted egg yolk and garlic), but none was worth my 2nd try. The only salvage was the herbal prawn, prawns were fresh and juicy. My grandpa liked the kongbak (braised pork). All other dishes were not terrible either, it was just okay. I remembered eating here years ago and had much better impression of their seafood than this time. If you really have to eat here, do not miss the angus beef. If you have special craving for worthy crab, you'll be better off elsewhere

Intro: this visit is actually my 2nd visit, The first time, I had tried the Angus Beef and Boss Beehoon which to my surprise that it is of quality esp. on the beef as this shop is a Tze Char Shop** despite of disappointment on grilled seafood. After recommendations I decided to give a 2nd chance on the Seafood. However, it was below my expectations bringing a tad of regret, I expected to be better than. **A Tze Char (a Chinese dialect term lit. Cook and Fry) Shop is actually a shop run like a hawker stall but has a premise of it's own and they serve Chinese style cooking mostly influence by Cantonese cooking but unique to South East Asia's flavors1. Food: Was expecting to be better. Chili Crab: This Classic Singapore Signature dish, when it was served warm, it still made it but as the dish cools down, the sourness of the tomato sauce might have been a bit off. Black Pepper Crab: This version taste pretty much like those served in the hotels buffet with the exception that the crab is fresher. Salted Egg Prawns: This version is a bit too salty for me, as compared to some which have added cream, this taste like it wasn't prepared much just merely cook the salted egg yolks into butter and stir fry with the prawns. too much of this is no good. Pork Satay (Skewered Pork with peanut sauce): Sad to say this was the only dish that i find it okay but it a bit too pricey where you can get something better at 20% cheaperSmoked meat fried rice: a combination of east meets west. overall it was fine but not "wow" enough2. Value: Other than the crabs which is having a nice promotion, it isn't very value for money given the place, service and atmosphere in totality.3. Service: The Service here are very drastic, some good some bad in in general is sucky. They would even reprimand you for not using the restroom to wash you hands despite that the lemon water is used to rid the smell of the food. 4. Atmosphere: They have tried to cover the surrounding to break it but the fact that it is in an industrial area and the fact that it is in an old place doesn't make you feel better, sometimes you can smell chemicals just outside the shop. Plus the tables they have assigned was bad, on a wooden plank over a drainage. the feel was horrendous and it really makes me off my appetite. 5. Conclusion: I believe they can do better than this in my Review Gauge: 33/10

My first visit to this restaurant last Sunday was pleasant given the quality of the food I ordered except for the noodles. It was too soggy and I did not rate that highly. The beef was good but I wondered why it came with fried rice; being served together with fries is understandable but I thought the rice was odd as it did not go well with the beef. However, for those heavy eaters, this is a value for money dish - one order and you get three items. (We had to pack the rice home). The fried prawn roll was excellent is among the best I have taken. Finally, the garlic crab was pretty good and I was tempted to pack home the garlic as well. Why waste such tasty items.

Great food, fast service. They even managed to accommodate us even though we were about 15 min early
5
friendly service, excellent and fresh food, with a surprising variety. The wine list is absolutely sufficient and competitively priced. the entire setting is down to earth, the minute you enter you feel surrounded by happy diners and a good vibe. very highly recommended.
4
Made reservation, received SMS confirmation and reminder, they also sent the promotion on the day of reservation. Great upsell! Service crew is great - also gave my hubby a birthday chocolate tart with a lit up candle. So sweet.
5
Took a friend here for dinner
Speed of food coming out was fast and tasty
It has a wonderful atmosphere - feels like we've been transported back in time to an Al fresco dining location
5
This is my fifth visit and I'm definitely coming back again and again! Their food is consistently good, service is forever attentive and they just get better from my each visit. Well deserved Michelin 1-star restaurant 🌟
4
The half boiled egg w foie gras was the best. The halibut with petai and chinchalok sauce was very good too! My Korean friend was absolutely thrilled with the food!
5
Our first visit and New Ubin indeed offers amazing food and price!Reservation is a must especially for their air-con room but be patience wth their responses.What attracted me was their US beef with heart attack fried rice which was the star of day!!!Beef was tender with juicy pink centerTheir Hokkien Mee is another must try. One of the best awesome service i gotten when I requested for more pork lard.When our Mee is served, the server surprised us with a bowl fully filled with pork lard!!! A traditional Zi Char restaurant that serves both local and western cuisine Will definitely bring my oversea friends and family there
4
Amazing place with a surreal location, surrounded by auto repair shops. The 'Seafood' in the name is a misnomer - in addition to crab (served all possible ways), bamboo clams, oysters, prawns, squid, and fish, they also serve steaks, satay (including foie gras satay!), pork knuckles, kangkong, etc. Calling it a zi char doesn't do it justice, since in addition to Chinese, it also serves Indian, Malay, American, and German dishes. A wine list that would put many proper restaurants to shame. Friendly and efficient service. All this good food and homey atmposphere at remarkable value. Never mind the 'B' hygiene rating, or the rats that run outside the place at night - people come all over town to visit, so make sure you book

Came here for a family dinner. Made reservation and was early, staff there gave us a Big table in the air-conditioned room. The table was for 10 people, a bit too big for a family of 3. Nevertheless, we were happy because it was air-conditioned. We ordered buy 2 get 1 crab promotion. Ordered chili crab, black pepper and ginger onion. Potion of the food was big, worth the money. Service by the staff was quite prompt. In the end, the bill was reasonable as compared to other seafood restaurants we have eaten. So will come here again!
3
Latest visit for dinner with friends. Arrived 5 mins early for our reservation and told to wait, table being cleared. 20 minutes later, after all other parties that arrived later than us whisked in and sat, I approached the counter to check. Was greeted by an eye-rolling waitress and an impatient "Your table is still being cleared."Finally got seated immediately after that. Food is slowly declining in quality while prices keep creeping upward.
4
For first timer, try their signature dishes.
I had beef, haddock fillet, satay, Hokkien Mee, fried baby sotong
Guest , both locals and foreigners were pleased with the food
5
Servers went the extra mile, to provide attentive and unobstrusive service. Helped to set up a birthday cake complete with many candles.
Chilli crab and beef were excellent.
4
2nd time here, lunch service seems slower even though it is more crowded during dinner time. Food was still as good. Highly recommend the US black angus ribeye and boss beehoon!
4
It's located near some car work shop area, quite crowded during weekend. I order fried chicken wings which is quite good, fried meehoon is ok, the steak is really good and must try, stir fried vegetables is also very good.
3
Food is okay but overall seems over-rated. Service could be vastly improved! Was slightly late for reservation as could not find the place. Hence called the restaurant to explain the situation and the person on the phone was understanding and hold the reservation. However, upon reaching, explained the situation to employees at counter, they were indifferent and more interested in engaging their own tasks done. After shown to table, NO one gave us a menu to order despite waiting for 10 minutes and no one is interested to take our order and seems to be pushed around to have our order taken. When asked for recommendation for dishes at ordering, answers were mediocre! Its a BIG embarrassment when I am entertaining overseas guests there for first time. Fortunately and only saving grace was that we managed to get some attention from two elderly workers later whom we were able to see to our needs and requests
2
Considering the price point, service level is found wanting. Despite not crowded (at 5:30pm) and we had sufficient time before next table slot (7:30pm), food came out in a rush. We had two wrong orders. We certainly can find another place with better ambience and food quality. Hope they will improve on this.
3
I have been there many times but this recent visit was not a very pleasant experience. We ordered three crabs in three styles, the chili crab was not very fresh, especially the claw part. The restaurant was so busy that it was very noisy all the time, and booking is tough as you can only have the table for two hours, which was quite stressful
5
Our Singaporean friend warned us not to be alarmed if the taxi took us into the middle of an industrial area with car body workshops and, indeed, that is where you find The New Ubin Seafood Restaurant - in the middle of nowhere. It's a sprawling Chinese style street food place, with copious tables - all full! Reservation recommended. We had the most amazing dishes. Satays (yay!), chili crab ( double yay) but also the most delicious fried eggplant that I can't describe except to say it seemed caramelised. We had about 8 dishes, each excellent, but apparently the chili crab is the best in Singapore. The decor is what you would expect of a street stall, but the toilet was sit-down rather than squat, so that had beeninstalled to European expectations (thank you!) We needed Uber to get a taxi, since the location is off the beaten track, but I'm sure the restaurant would have called a taxi for us if we hadn't had data roaming.
4
Located just below the residential blocks, New Ubin Seafood Restaurant seems like a prime dinner spot for the locals. I like that they offer quite a few creative dishes like the Angus Ribeye Steak with fried rice and Foie Gras egg. It sounds a little bizarre but its really worth the try. I also realised (after going) that there are some dishes that needs to be pre-ordered before your visit
4
We ordered tiger prawn (buy 1 get 1 free), three crabs (buy 2 get 1 free, in three flavors) and kang kong. The vegetable and prawn were nice. Chill crab was a bit sour, but the steamed crab and especially garlic baked crab were very delicious. The serving time was a bit long after the kang kong
5
Very nice menu for five people witl all the best dishes: amazing foie gras, three sorts of crabs ... A great moment !
4
The seafood is fresh and delicious. Love the hokkien mee. Very popular place despite the ulu location
4
Staffs noticed the long wait for food to be served and gave us complimentary drinks while we wait. Attentive in their service.
4
love the noodles with dried parsnips and the crab that was served
was a little disappointed with the steak as it was way over done for our liking. we had a good meal nonetheless
good pricing too!
4
Food is fresh and delicious but too salty.hope next time it will be improved. I will take my family there again.
5
We've been here many times and prefer the meat to the seafood. The steak and ribs are great. The restaurant allows you to byo booze with no corkage. A great place to go with a group of friends
3
We book at that place by recommendation of a friend. There, we ask to the weitress if 1 crab (of 800gr) was enough for 2 poeple (of course is it...) but she tried to sold us a bigger one (of 2,5 kg) and a lot of specialities... I felt like a tourist who are trying to cheat... The crab was just ok
4
Sunday is a family day for bonding where we would choose a restaurant for lunch. We went to New Ubin seafood for its crabs. This did not disappoint us. On promotion was Angus beef with condiments and a plate of fried rice - thought that is a meal in itself. The place was busy and you need to make a reservation using the automated reservation application. I thought this restaurant has been around for 50 years is modernized. The place part air conditioned, part not, still reeks of the 60's.
4
Must make a reservation - It's very popular!Try and book your table in the air conditioned section. Dress really casual and cool - shorts and t-shirts are the norm here. The restaurant is mostly non-air conditioned though there is a small air conditioned section. It's proudly no frills - just superb food with no pretensions about the ambience or service. And the food is really divinely good. Fried rice and fried beehoon are unbelievable tasty; tender steak with fries, lobster soup, satay and meat platter were unforgettable. Prices are very reasonable.
5
My husband and I ordered the US Black Angus Ribeye Steak and Boss Bee Hoon. I personally really love the Boss Bee Hoon and it is one of the best I ever had. Steak was nicely cook and the fried rice that came along with it was yummy too but you can give the wedges a miss.
4
Like the setting. It remind me when I am mid twenty having dinner with my poly classmate having dinner at Pulau Ubin.
4
The food are good and the service is good as we are able to get our seat fast base on our reservation.
5
Reminiscent of old style restaurants that are now more commonly found in Malaysia, this gem has some of the best seafood fusion I have ever had in an unpretentious environment (though be prepared to pay top dollar, it's worth it though). Unlike the more upmarket seafood places like Jumbo or Red House, this place does not pretend to be fancy, nor would you be paying for the classy dinnerware. This is the sort of place you go to in a comfortable shirt you don't mind getting messy, where you dig into some excellent crab, beef, and one egg-foie gras dish that was out of this world
4
What can i say? A rustic seafood restaurant right in the middle of an industrial park full of car repair workshops. To get there, you either drive or take a taxi. Walk-in is near impossible, unless you plan to wait 2 hours for the overflowing dinner crowd to clear. You will definitely reserve ahead. The food is rather decent. The crabs were fresh, and cooked to near perfection, especially the baked garlic crabs. The menu is quite extensive, offering all various dishes of meats and greens in addition to the usual seafoods. My advice is to stick to the seafoods, and surprising the bbq ribs. There is only a few tables in the air-conditioned enclosure, and be prepared to do alfresco dining in the humid Singapore weather. The restaurant has a wine cellar and serves a decent wine list. I did not check if the restaurant allows BYOW, but there is no harm asking. It may charge a reasonable corkage charge. We, a party of 3, managed to chalk up a bill of S$215.00 without alcoholic drinks. So, be prepared to pay S$70 per person
4
I am a regular here and love this place. Try and book the aircon rooms! Their food is awesome and reasonable. Favourites are their steak with fried rice, deep fried kailan, their boss beehoon, their hokkien mee and their Chai po kway teow. I love the carbs here more than their seafood! Always busy, always with a buzz! The best teze char in Singapore
5
With high expectation, I visited New Ubin Seafood Restaurant for the first time on National Day, 9 August 2016 to celebrate a good friend's birthday.The US Angus Beef coupled with Fried Rice using the beef fats was fabulous and simply shiok and the Blue Mussels cooked with white wine and garlic was marvellous too. Well done Chef 
3
I would say that food and service were good. Friendly and generally attentive staff where kopitiam environment was concerned. We ordered the foie gras with egg, rib eye, pork knuckle, brinjal, Kai lan and salted egg yolk squid. All were tasty. Our only grouse was that the place was filthy. The floor was littered with soilled tissues/serviettes which was gross. They should up their hygiene and cleanliness.
5
Are you tired of Chilly or Pepper crabs? Then you should try the Garlic Crab. I never imagined that taste of crab together with garlic would be such a great. And, do not miss out the steak, it was highly recommend by everybody, and it was all true. Finally, try foie gras. It was one of the best foie gras that I tried in Singapore
3
Interesting eatery which showcase the true Singapore makan culture. Good food and service, especially loved the complimentary corkage and ice bucket.The place would be more conducive with better ventilation (inside seating) and that patrons are given more time (1hr per seating is very short) to enjoy their dinner.
4
Don't be deceived by its humble location... Tucked within the car servicing hub location, away from the city... This place serve great seafood which threaten even the big names at the East Coast. The crabs served in Garlic butter, spicy is great. Be sure to leave some stomach for its prawn balls and fried rice! Frequented by a majority of locals, the price is certainly worth the travel. Please make reservation by using Chope app, or call direct to avoid disappointment
5
This is the second time that I visit this restaurant. The first time I come with my friendes and this time with my families. The food is amazing and the price is cheap.
5
The atmosphere was pretty casual and laid back, albeit somewhat chaotic but the food made up for it for sure!
4
Overall nice food and ambience. Especially recommend the US rib eye steak that serves with clay pot fried rice which taste fragrant. Hokkien mee is also recommended, gravy is thick and ingredients are fresh.
5
We had just 4 hours in Singapore on our way home to Sydney from a holiday in Thailand. This was enough time to have lunch with a local friend who recommended this place. It was a bit of a trek, about 35 mins from the airport (which is quite far in Singapore terms), but totally worth it! The restaurant is in the middle of an industrial area, opposite a lot of car body repair shops. It's nothing fancy and not touristy AT ALL which is one of the best things about it. Service was quick and friendly.The menu is extensive, I hear they do great steak but I needed a crab fix being a visitor to Singapore. We ordered Hong Kong Kai lan, salted fish bean sprout - both delicious and cooked perfectly. Also bbq tiger prawns and black pepper crab - huge prawns cooked perfectly and the crab was the best I've had anywhere!!! We will definitely go back there again for a fix next time we visit Singapore, even if just for a quick visit like this one. Thank you new Ubin seafood for the best meal of our whole trip - it was amazing
5
After hearing about New Ubin Seafood for awhile, our family was quite keen to give it a try for ourselves. We booked a reservation for my mum's birthday dinner and were not at all disappointed! The online reservation process was smooth, the waiter who served us was extremely friendly and hospitable, the food came quite quickly, and of course, everything was delicious! We especially enjoyed the buy-2-get-1-free deal for the crabs (we tried white pepper, garlic and black pepper - our favorites were the white pepper and garlic) but also other favorites like the rib-eye steak and HK kai-lan special. My mum was even treated with a free birthday dessert! All in all, a memorable experience, and we'll definitely be back
4
Food was awesome and delicious. We have been there a lot of times and the standard is still good. Only twice we been there with friends which was the food standard a bit dropped because was too many people and was festive season. Overall I still rate it as awesome
5
Was wary after reading some of the negative reviews out there but hey, our party of 14 had a great time! The service was attentive and proactive to change plates and bowls with a smile. The food was yummy - my favourites include the mee goreng (fried noodles) which has that nice "wok hei" taste and of course the famous steak diced into bite sized pieces. The durian pengat was rich and delightful. Kaya (coconut egg jam) toast for dessert? Well not the usual meal of the day for that but the kaya was light and yet flavourful. The vanilla ice cream reminded me of my lovely wife's homemade recipe, with its telltale dots of natural vanilla and yellowish tone. I can't find anything wrong with this place and will be back for sure.
5
We went in a group of 7 and all 7 of us left happy and very satisfied with the food. We are planning our next visit to new ubin already. The steak is a MUST order. The hokkien mee and foie gras with half boiled egg was excellent too. Can't wait to go back and try all the other signature dishes
4
Have eaten here many times. There are certain dishes that those "in the know" have to order. You will note none of these are seafood.... Ribeye, pork knuckle, pork and lamb satay, pork collar and boss beehoon. However, and this was sorely disappointing on my latest visit, do not order dessert here. It will take forever (we waited 20 minutes while indifferent staff repeatedly claimed it was "on the way") and when it arrives, will be poor. Better to get your full of meats and run
4
Ordered: Beef steak with fried rice, 1 black pepper crab, 2 Chilli crabs, deep fried eggplant, salted egg squid...No complain about the quality of the food and the service. My colleagues and I enjoyed ourselves. But the place is a little stuffy and warm. Can improve in it.
5
food is really nice and service is good too. ambience is ok. Value for money and good location for gatherings.
4
The Hokkien Mee, Angus beef and Kai Lan were really good. However, the table we were given (there were 4 of us) was quite squeezy and it took awhile to catch the attention of the waiters at times. Overall, a good experience with good food.
5
awesome fatty beef fried rice, beef, foie gras n garlic baked crabs.
the freshness of the crabs blew me away. thumbs-up!
4
Have come here before a few times. Standards reliably good. The beef is still excellent and the XL crabs superb
4
Delicious steak that was just as I remembered it. The salt and pepper squid was disappointingly bland however. Maybe it knew it had already accepted that it just couldn't compare to the beef.
4
Food is great and innovative, but the restaurant is really small and space is tight. Located in an industrial area, the restaurant looks rather makeshift. It makes for an interesting"zhi char" experience in Singapore. Reservations are highly recommended, even for weekdays.
3
Food was good as usual but the staff service were lacking in these few aspects:- Lack of attention to customers needs. eg: ensuring water is replenished and not standing around.- Clearing of plates while customers were still eating off the plate.- Leaving of beer bucket (still with beer) i=on he floor instead of finding an alternative location or stool to place the bucke
5
Since we discovered this place, we've made a tradition of celebrating every family members birthday here. If we can't have dinner at the restaurant, we'd still call to order the food for pick-up. The steak with it's sinful fried rice, crab dishes and boss bee hoon are must tries! The food is great and yet the price is reasonable. The place is always packed for dinner so make sure to make a reservation
5
I know this is a seafood restaurant as the name states, but the highlight really is the steak! The steak is beautifully seasoned and nicely cooked, and cut into pieces to share. Very tender and juicy. They will also serve a fried rice with it - cooked in the fats of the steak and very very delicious!Their boss beehoon is also amazing, and definitely a must order! It's apparently bee hoon cooked the way the boss likes it, and the boss definite has good taste cos this is great!The seafood is good too, but nothing really that memorable that you can't find in other places like Jumbo
5
Chilli, black peper crab, barbecue beef, poached egg with fois gras... This isolated restaurant offers high quality of food in a unique place.Located in an industrial area for car repair, New Ubin seafood is a must discover when living in singapore or for traveller who wants to go beyond singapore marina and tourist spot to enjoy more local place and authentic food. Recommended!!
5
Food was fresh with excellent cooking, reservation is somehow a must else difficult to get table. Plenty of dishes available. Great beef and seafood.
4
2nd visit and love it! tried the wagyu beef and the rice. it was delicious and tasty. had the salted egg yolk crab and it was full of salted egg sauce.
5
The booking was efficient and easy, the rest of the work was done by the food of the restaurant And the staff there. Very good experience
5
Wanted to try out the famous crabs, but they ran out of good sized crabs. So we gave it a miss and went for Black Angus Beef Steak.Very good quality steaks and superbly prepared to medium-rare. The dish was paired with tasteful potato wedges and a generous serving of their special fried rice (cooked with a nice essence of beef).Great food, generous portions and value for money steak.Will be back again for the crab and many more
4
I booked almost 2 weeks ahead to get a table in the aircon room - it was worth it.. food yummy, especially the steaks. We ordered the eggplant dish, but didn't like the sweetish taste. The prawn paste chicken was fab though! So was the kangkong with sambal.
3
Not sure if the original chef was on leave, but the food was much much much saltier than the last time I went. The beef rice was so salty we barely touched it. Same goes for the oyster omelet - egg was too salty.However, we were glad we got attentive service from (especially) Uncle Tan and Jaso
2
We went for dinner yesterday for the first time. The XL Sri Lankan crab was very disappointing as the meat was not firm nor fresh. We asked for a female one when we placed the order but when the chili crab was served, the waiter could not even confirm whether we got what we wanted. For the price we pay at this largely makeshift shed, this is not a value for money venue for seafood lovers
2
Food was not bad but I would still rate as average though. The raw oyster lacks freshness and meat shrunk. The Angus beef was not as specular as what others claimed to be good. We asked for the smallest cut since my 2 daughters are small eater. Waiter came back and informed they only left with the larger cut only at 600g @ $13 per 100g. We were disturbed when the same waiter informed the Cacausian diners next to our table that he will get them smaller cut at 500g. This really spoilt my appetite. This is not good service n unethical(??). Dishes were served fast and it gives you the impression that they were rushing to clear you out asap. The area that we sat, each time someone walked passed, the chair vibrates which is rather irritating due to the floor board. Overall, I personally feel that the place is over hyped and yes the bad experience on the beef cut which we only managed to finish half the portion
5
You have to reserve a table first before coming here. Located in the middle of industrial area/warehouses, don't be surprised if u think u got lost finding the restaurant. Place is packed, even on the weekdays. Food is good, price is reasonable, service is friendly, fast and good. My favorite : 1. Beef Steak 2. Caramelized Eggplant 3. Squid cooked with Salted Egg Yolk 4. Shrimp paste chicken wings  Recommended! Will definitely come again!
5
The food was excellent. In particular the chilli and garlic baked crab. Also the signature dish of rib eye black angus steak. Will definitely come back again, but it is important that on weekends you book in advance otherwise you may have a long wait. Booking can be done on line. Unusually for a neighborhood restaurant they have quite a large wine cella
4
Great food. Slightly pricy. Must order the beef and egg plant. Waited quite a while for our bill, asked for it like 4 times
5
Not our first trip here, but nevertheless I've decided to post this to put up my recommendations.
Anyone who comes here must try their beef, their ngoh hiang, their satay, their fried rice and their pasta. Two thumbs up
1
The wait for garlic baked crabs was almost 1hr in between other dishes. And crabs came in big disappointment. They were not enough garlic flavours and salty.
5
Not a typical Singapore restaurant. The food excellent, service medium and the surroundings very basic. Would go again.
3
Ample food choice, the serving time is fast, the food is tasty. I will come again
Because the infrastructure is old, i experienced intermittent blackout which is quite disruptive
4
The food here is outstanding. The steaks are succulent and flavourful, while the lamb does not have the "lamby" smell associated with mutton. The seafood is fresh and delicately done. This is a great east meets west restaurant. What deserves special mention are the fried brinjals(eggplant). My kids usually refuse to eat them but they shoveled these up their mouths and were shocked to learn that they were eating brinjals. Very uniquely prepared - crispy with a hint of sweet and sour....the only reason this place did not get 5/5 from me is the ambience as it is located within an industrial estate. Make reservations early and try to get the air conditioned rooms! Really worth the visit
3
We ordered the 398++ set for 10 person. The set was not flexible at all. I wanted to change the Chilli crab to some other style but it was not allowed. The crab tastes nice anyway. The caramelised eggplant tasted weird and the other option as kai lan... Again we could change to something more normal like spinach... US beef was good ... Salted egg prawns were nice but overall I think it was not a very nice exp ... Conclusion --- don't take the se
5
What a dinner - to be remembered for a long time!Every single dish was simply perfect - eggplants like I never had before, tiger prawns in garlic, chili crab and many more. Book a table in advance! Place is packed. Better to go with 6-10 people party, to try many things.
2
Went there for parents birthday celebration, sitting was fast as I had reserved 1 week in advance. Looking forward towards the food.First 4 dishes came relatively fast, then. Next dish took kinda forever to arrived and the subsequent ones.Ordered salted egg squid, fried baby shrimp, 2+1 crab promo (Chilli, Garlic bake, Salted egg) and few other dishes.Disappointed in all their crabs, wasn't fresh. Its meat were mashy, chilli crab wasn't hot. Not to the extend I would said cold if you know what I meant. Baby shrimp wasn't deep fried to how I thought it would be, it was just mehh, didn't even finished it. So was the salted egg squid, squid wasn't deep fried btw maybe its just their style.Overall, I won't returned for the food however service was good and can't complained much as the prices are reasonably cheap
5
THE best is almost every aspect and every dish. Don't expect a posh ambience; it's the food you came for in an authentic but clean restaurant (in the midst of an industrial zone, no less!)The serving staff speak fluent English, and the washrooms are clean!Eat your heart out; the ribeye steak fried rice can trigger a heart attack, but is so worth the risk
4
Great service! Went with two kids and the staff were really attentive throughout the meal. Food was good too!
4
Food is good. Steak was rather pricey for that place. Atmosphere and service could be better. But overall experience is pleasant.
5
A great staple go to place for excellent food. Highly recommend a visit to anyone that hasn't tried it.
5
Highly recommended for food
Must try beef, herbal chicken soup and many more
Their service is also very good
4
Fresh ingredients were used and the taste was fantastic! Reservations were made easily and advanced orders were all in order! Service was prompt too.
5
The food was delicious and the service was excellent! The angus beef is a MUST TRY dish! Definately gonna come back again!
4
We reserved a table for 4 pax for dinner at 1730hrs. They would require the table back by 1930hrs for the next seating. We reached at 1730hrs sharp, and it only took about 5-10 mins for us to get seated. There was a promo for crabs (buy 2 get 1 free), so we ordered that. The styles we chose were : black pepper, chilli, salted egg. We also ordered other dishes e.g. veg, mee goreng. The food was pleasant. 4 of us were seated at a relatively small table. Space was limited. Our dishes came really fast and there wasn't any space to place the dishes. It just kept coming. I feel that the staff/servers should take note of that. 3 huge plates for 3 crabs, another 2-3 other dishes to add, and not forgetting drinks etc, we couldn't eat comfortably.They did not chase us out at 1930hrs though. We were done at about 1945/2000hrs.Overall, food & service was pleasant
5
I came here for dinner with my two friends. One of them couldnt eat crab so we only ordered the crab with fried vermicelli, the steak and the steak fried rice, prawns and some veggies. The portion of the crab vermicelli was massive that came with a gigantic crab that was sweet and plump and lots of delicious vermicelli. The three of us couldn't finish it so I had to ask them to pack it for take away. I literally brought the leftovers back all the way to Hong Kong and had it for dinner at home the following evening. This place is definitely a must go whenever in Singapore. It is a bit hard to find so make sure the cab driver knows how to get there before you jump into the cab. We were lucky to find a cab driver who knew the way and dropped us right outside the restaurant. Very good value for the foo
4
Alfresco dining made more interesting with more than just "zi char" food. The signature Hokkien mee is a must order. Pork satay was great too! Advance order is required for the German pork knuckle so we didn't get to have any. Food portion was generous too.
5
We had a really nice table in the corner. Staff was attentive, food was really good. Easy convenient reservations through Chope, no hassles. Even though they messaged to take the table back for 2nd seating but since no one else showed, we could dine leisurely. The US steak is a MUST! quality and delicious! Yum.....my mouth is already watering again!
5
First time I have been there and the food lived up to my expectations. Food quality was great. Really enjoyed the beef. We have already recommended it to friends. Have low expectations on location.
5
Food at New Ubin is always excellent. Great variety and fresh seafood. But fave is still the steak and the rice that comes with it.
4
- great atmosphere, lively and charming on a Friday night
- prompt and friendly service despite the full restaurant
- great value for money
- would recommend and return for a second visit. Well done!
3
Our food was not served piping hot - despite the repeated reminder and request - it arrived luke warm for the steak and chili crab.
4
2+1 crabs were awesome to enjoy different cooking style at once. Angus beef steak was juicy and soft. Atmosphere is typical local restaurant, not neat or cosy.
2
Inferior quality crabs served. 3 crabs cooked in 2 styles. Only the smallest tiniest one was ok quality, the other 2 technically big ones were soggy and soft. When feedback, service crew was rude and took an extra 40 mins with 3 reminders to replace the order and only 1 crab was replaced. Interesting selection of food but such lousy service is intolerable. Never again for me
5
Oh wow this beef! Barely cooked in the center and great tenderness. But the "heart attack rice" takes the prize. So called because it's cooked in beef fat, it's probably not the healthiest but frankly who cares! I'd also recommend the wasabi prawns, and the salt egg crab. With cholesterol at New Ubin its in for a penny, in for a pound
4
Eventhough this restaurant located in industrial area and the ambience is not like those fancy restaurant but it serve quite good food.We love their angus beef steak and fried rice. Their hokkien mee and cereal prawn also taste good. Seems they know how to stir it well and use premium fresh ingredients.Tried the dessert. We love durian pengat and chocs lava with ice cream.Foods are reasonably priced as food and service is good.Need to book appointment as some times it quite packed
3
The service staff were friendly and helpful. All requests were quickly met. Food-wise, can be better. The crabs were not very fresh and one had a pincer with rotted meat. The staff were quick to replace the dish when we informed them. It was nice that a senior service staff actually came by again to ask what went wrong, and apologised. It is a rustic environment, good for a messy meal with friends.

i came down with my 2 girlfriends yesterday for dinner. The buy 2 get 1 crabs promotion was just awesome . At the recommendation of Koon, we ordered a hookien mee and 2 ways kai lan. however it will good if their foods served will be hotter . I will be coming tomm night for Father day celebration! can't wait to try other dishes too.
4
Nice as an occasional visit. Too often and your arteries will be clogged!!!
Wish they had more healthy options for those at the table who are too health conscious. Otherwise makes the rest feel guilty !!
5
Love coming here. They noodles "boss style" is a fav along with their rib eye steak. Tried their Chilli crab and it is excellent as well. It's not a fancy restaurant, but being tucked in an industrial estate is part of its charm.
5
Whilst they have an admirable wine list, this upmarket hawker accommodates you brining your own, so if you're planning a BYO wine night, this is the place. The beef platter is awesome and the satay is very good. The staff are excellent and friendly.
5
Although we didn't get the air conditioned section as requested, place was cool & comfortable. Place had happy vibe & food was excellent as usual.
5
Great food, good service and a nice atmosphere. The steak was great, the oysters very fresh and the local dishes tasty. A very good value to boot.
5
Nice food and ambiance. excellent service. will bring more friends to visit this restaurant. Better to make reservation before you visit the restaurant as it is always pack especially weekend. food will serve within 15mins after you have ordered. that is very fast compared to other restaurant. friendly staf
5
Thanks for the awesome experience last night! Everyone was blown away by the quality of the food, and the helpfulness of the staff. Admittedly, it was a little pricey, and not having aircon definitely made everyone a little hot and uncomfortable, but nobody could fault the food and service. And that's what we came to do anyway - eat!!
5
The Rib-eye steak is TO DIE FOR. Yes, yes.. The seafood is great. I'd go for the squid, the eggplant ... Heck order anything on the board ... Can't go wrong. Amazing quality food, but the beef is really the best part of the entire meal!
5
We had crab dishes, but the one cooked with Russian garlic was my favorite, and the recommended coconut ice cream served with caramelized fried banana for dessert was just out of this world. The chefs have excellent palettes, and everyone was friendly. The only set back was location, in the middle of industrial area which is not easily accessible, if you don't have your own transport
3
Food came within 10mins after we ordered. Dishes ordered were;1. Salted egg York squid, the flavor was very good but squid feels under cooked.2. Signature Kai lan, excellent dish.3. 500g steak with fried rice, a must order.4. You Tiao Salad, good dish with two different dips.5. Cai pok noodles, good wok hei taste but good for salty food lovers
4
The restaurant is a bit out of place but definitely worth it.
Tried their steak, the steak sauce fried rice, their fried hokkien mee , pork knuckles, crab etc all very nice.
4
Food was ok but its abit warm and cramp.Would be better if place be fully air condition.Staff were friendly and efficient.The crab was good.
4
Good hangout place for friends and family. Steak is good. The outside seating can get a little warm and uncomfortable.
3
The beef is good and we can't get enough of it. We also order crab - butter cream (taste like carbonara - quite weird for crab), chili (still okay) and black pepper (so-so) lastly the service is really slow. We need to keep waving our hands to get attention of their staffs. Serving speed/wait is acceptable.
4
It's the place to go to for great food and inexpensive wine. You can BYOB (except beer) or you can choose from their extensive list of good, affordable bottles of wine (nothing by the glass). Garlic crab was awesome! Boss beehon was super tasty and the kaolin was fresh and crunchy. Definitely a place to visit again
4
The steak is really awesome but the only inflexibility is that they would not make to cater to different diners' preferences - they only make their steak to one same level "medium well" which is in fact more medium than well. The fried rice that came with it was delicious though. So was the sweet potato leaves with sambal. The Fried Oyster Egg was good, but I thought a little over-priced.
5
Stepping into the enclosure of the restaurant immediately transported us back to the carefree days of old. The reservation, seating, ordering, food savouring and payment process was simply an exquisite experience. The team of staff is simply superb and customer-centric. I discovered a most unexpected gem amongst an industrial estates, with rows of car workshops ☺
4
Always nice to dine here but needs to make reservation as it is always crowded.Beef steak is wonderful. Fried rice with oil from the beef steak is a must. Others- pepper crab. Roast pork with bun. Wine list is extensive n reasonably price.Heard the place is planned for clearance... not sure...but do enjoy the food when its still here.
4
We ordered the signature beef cubes (medium rare) that was really tender and we didnt know it came with this black fried rice that was really nice and flavorful, Boss beehoon recommended by the staff and i highly recommend it if you can take spicy food, it was filled with wok-hei which i love, Kailan was fresh and crunchy. Salted egg crab, crab was fresh but i would prefer if the sauce was creamier as its more to the dry kind. Sat outside and it was a bit stuffy, would be better if there were more fans.Really enjoyed the food n would definitely go back.
3
Brought a couple of seniors here for lunch as it is rather difficult to get to without transport. We ordered the recommended dishes which were quite good. Our favorite was the prawn paste chicken. We then had dessert which was yam paste (in local language, orh ni); this was excellent which is the reason for the very good rating below.The menu had an eclectic mixed of cuisines; seafood , chinese, steak, indian etc. There is something for everyone
5
Went here with 6 friends tonight and had great food the whole night. Well priced wine and byob with no corkage is amazing. Great place and will certainly be back. Not a high end setting but that makes it even better IMO.
4
Price slightly more ex than usual zi char stall but totally worth it! But environment a bit stuffy and warm.
5
You don't need an expensive fancy restaurant at a prime location in the city to impress your guests.
Ubin never fails to impress my guests with its unique atmosphere and great food.
1
Totally agree on other customers' reviews lately, we've been to New Ubin 6 times, recent dinner was horribly disappointing. Reservation system sucks. Dishes were served cold & taste was mediocre, shall not return for good.
5
I love the food at New Ubin Seafood. The restaurant is always packed everytime I go, and yet the staff is always attentive and helpful. Many thanks to the servers who are always so kind and thoughtful!
5
Went here for dinner with friends - huge range of local and western food options, all excellent! Good wine list, fantastic desserts and great service - the location may be hidden away but thats part of the charm!Would highly recommend to anyone but do book ahead - we had to book 3 weeks in advanc
5
There was no dry tissue offered but one of the servers (an Indian gentleman) was very helpful- he gave us a kitchenpaper roll. Initially they said we can only stay for an hour since we came late by 45 min (thanks to a thunderstorm) but later accommodated us to stay till 9pm. overall, great experience. The aunty who served us was very friendly too
4
Seafood rave! Call first esp. on dining hour, and go there in group so you can have various menu in affordable price. My absolute fave is the crab in salted egg, dip mantau in the sauce, yumm! Another fave is their steak. Square chopped, tender and juicy.Make sure you order the regular crab for buy 2 get 1 promo. Unless if you're loaded with cash then feel free to order the XL size
5
I was there over the weekend for dinner.The angus beef, fried rice and the boss mee hoon were great but cant really say that crabs that I ordered were fantastic. Probably just normal. The staff is very attentive and helpful with good food suggestions.Must make reservation early to avoid eating at the non-aircon and cramped corner
5
Had Mother's Day dinner at the restaurant last weekend. The order taker patiently gave us recommendations on the menu when we could not decide which style of the dish to choose. She even gave us a bowl of white rice on the house just so we could try the sauce of the dish she recommended. It might not be an expensive item, but to me, this is the difference between normal service and excellent ones =) Food serving time was good too
2
The food was disappointing and definitely not within my expectation. Made the booking upon seeing some good reviews. Will not be visiting anymore.
2
Returned for the 4th time of the year, sad to say that their food standard has dropped. Or maybe just the day we went ?
4
Observant and prompt service, fresh well cooked seafood. What more could you ask for on a night out with friends?
5
Pork knuckle, beef and pork ribs were excellent! Highly recommended. Took into account the babies in the family and provided high chairs though the babies were too small for high chairs.
4
We like the atmosphere of New Ubin but we would like to suggest that you do something to reduce the noise of plates and glasses when the waiters have to reorganize them once washed and cleaned.
4
Awesome place, with nice food. If you like to experience eating in an old kampong feel place, this will be the recommended place for you.
5
Their brinjal specialty dish is very good and unique. Their beef was done very well and the crab bee hoon was excellent. Black pepper crab was good as well. The seafood is very fresh here. The satay was normal, nothing to shout about. Service was good despite the busy crowd on mother's day.
5
Its a whole journey getting there driving through an industrial estate - which is why its quite fun. Most of the time its hot unless you get their private room which is wonderfully air con. There are so many well-known food which is really yummy like heart attack fried rice and the boss mee hoon. Loads of fat. The crab is great because there are loads of garlic and that is so healthy!!! Lobster ; oyster; US grade beef.... the list goes on and on.... Having said all of that, one is really here for the total experience of this rustic back to 70s feel rather than anything else
4
Although the location is a little bit difficult to find and it's a bit noisy. It is a great find for good food and service. The staff was attentive and tried their best to cater to our needs. The beef is a must try and the drunken prawns were to die for.. love the soup.
2
But we drive all the way there to eat the seafood, what's the point when someone had to cancel our bill n eat nothing in the end. Was just hoping they shall say " let's us try to replace it wit one more time , then if still not good we will cancel the bill" instead he say " well I can't guaranteed the next replacement if the crab is good or not..so maybe we shall not try anymore and cancel it."
5
Good place to go with a group and always book. Very busy and not smart at all, but fantastic food, very attentive service and brilliant value. BYO wine too.
5
Boss Bee hoon & FOie GRas SOft Boiled EGg are the best food. My kid enjoyed the pork collar from the signature platter.
Spinach in 3 egg is not that great.
4
Rustic environment with excellent food though it can get a bit warm at the non aircon area. Kurobuta pork rib is excellent. Tender and Juicy!
5
Interesting location with wonderful food and good selection of wine! Service was friendly and prompt!
3
There were only 2 of us so we ordered only the beef and their signature garlic crab. Angus beef was ordered medium. It was cooked properly. However, maybe because the staff were too busy, the beef was served only sometime after it was cooked. It was not sizzling hot and was a bit cold. The scent of beef has somehow vanished and the fat was not delicious anymore.The signature crab, garlic crab, doesn't have much flavour. It did not leave any impression to me. I bet other dishes like chili crab of salted egg crab would be much better.There was service charge as well, which surprised me a bit. Two of us spend 150 on two dished, which is not cheap
4
Came here as recommended by my children. Parking was limited due to the crowd. If parked at nearby Industrial area, walking among dark alleys. We got second seating at 815pm. The place is full with locals n tourists - alive with sound n sights. Food was order quickly n with good recommendations. Food also came quickly surpassing expectations. Prices seems reasonable to portions given. Must try the live seafood - prawns, Gosh n crabs. Received good reviews. Worth a try. But book early
4
I know they are very popular & always full....but at time clearing the dishes too fast make us feels that we are being chase away......we would appreciate they do not immediately clear the dishes once the satay is gone but we do like to eat the cucumber & onions as they are meant to be eaten right not just for decoration !! Overall the food is good, fresh & price wise is on the high side but the beef is superbly nice & the garlic baked crab yummmmy !
5
Don't be put off by the location : in the midst of an industrial estate. This place is a culinary gem! Great seafood and more (the Beef and Heart attack Fried Rice is one of their signatures) : the kitchen turns out some of the most mouthwateringly innovative cuisine. The atmosphere and ambience remains uniquely Singapore! A must visit
4
Singapore is chock full of hearty Chinese style seafood and "tze char" restaurants and a few of the "famous" ones are tucked away in industrial estates probably due to the lower rentals. What's different about New Ubin is that in addition to the classic repertoire that's found at such restaurants, it has an interesting "western-fustion" selection too. So for the first time at a "down home" seafood restaurant, I had not one but 2 foie gras dishes ! And a very popular item here that we saw on almost every table, including ours, was a slab of angus steak with chips, grilled medium and cut into cubes so that it can be eaten with chopsticks. I enjoyed an interesting eggplant dish which was bursting with aromatics and also an interesting selection of other greens done in very simple chinese garlic style.The seafood selection is decent but I realised that for a restaurant that has beginnings in seafood, the meats and vegetable selections delighted more than its seafood offerings. We had 3 orders of crabs of which the garlic style was interesting only because it is not common at other similar places. For the black pepper and chilli style crabs, I'd say it was ok. One exception was the "hei zhor" or shrimp roll which tasted like it also had minced squid mixed in - that was chewy, moist and fried just crisp enough. I'd say worth the calories!Ambience wise, the restaurant is very popular, and very packed so be prepared for it to be very noisy! Choice of indoor air-conditioned dining or outdoor dining
5
Been to New Ubin a couple of times before and usually order a standard set of dishes such as the steak and beef fat rice, crabs and vege (e.g. Kangkong), etc. Never been a fan of the beef fat rice cause it always taste a bit too charred for my liking but absolutely love the beef, simple yet delicious. This time we didn't order crabs but we noticed manyn people ordering crabs that sat on what looked like a mountain of deep fried whole garlic cloves. Definitely going back to try them one day. Tried the chye poh kway teow for the first time and i have to say, it was worth every calorie although i wldnt suggest eating on a regular basis no matter how tempting that would be. The soft fragrant kway teow is fried with chunks of kai lan, chye poh and most importantly pork lard, lots of it. I felt guilty eating it but it was so good I cldnt stop. My friends and I joked about how there was more lard than chye poh on that plate. We also had the prawn paste chicken which was yummy although not very different from other good zhi char places. We ordered their specials of the day, Fine De Claire Oysters both natural and cooked in Mornay (baked in creamy cheesy sauce) style. Delicious! We had to restrain ourselves from ordering more. Excellent and efficient service from the start (including reservation) to end. SMS system for reservations was extremely useful and informative. Service staff were polite, friendly and attentive. Always kinda felt the place was a bit cram but rustic. Nevertheless we managed to get a table with ample space for a baby pram as requested. Probably my best visit yet. Will definitely be returning in the near future for more lard and crabs
4
...such good food in the middle of a row of car body shops...
The food was fresh and very tasty, staff was helpful and friendly! Prices are reasonable, portions pretty big so chose wisely!
5
Brilliant variety - Angus prime steak, lamb chops, Sri Lankan crabs, Tiger prawns, monster scallops, fresh oysters
5
Unique dishes, waiters are great at recommending dishes and portion sizes. Food is always perfect, and they take good care of us! Plus, it's not crazy expensive!
4
I had make the reservation of 10ppl at 8.30pm through Chope cos there no other time available. However, I reached there before 8pm and hoping I can get a table earlier. The staff manage to get a table for me. Staff at New Ubin is friendly and serving of the food is quite fast
4
Had dinner here on a Sunday evening. Evening parking was easy to find (as you can park at nearby closed motor workshops) compared to lunch time where it's hard to find an empty parking lot. Excellent crabs especially with their promotion of 3 crabs for $76. Crabs were fresh and meaty and done in 3 styles - baked garlic, chilli and salted egg. Our favourite was the baked garlic crab. Also had the ribeye steak with fried rice which was yummy. Best of all, there's free corkage. Food was served within a short time and service was good
5
Restaurant is tucked away at an industrial estate that has many motor workshops. Somewhere we would not expect to find unless guided. The service is excellent. If you are a seafood fan, this is the place. Sri Lankan Crabs among the best besides other dishes like Waygu Beef steak and stir fried dishes. It's casual dining, unlike Long Beach in Dempsey. Highly recommended
4
The meal package for 4-6 pax that is worth 268+++ is very worth it in my opinion. I didn't even realised the crabs came in 3 diff flavors! Food is too much for pax of 4 so 6 will be ideal! Service was excellent or rather we were lucky to be served by a cheerful chap.
5
New ubin seafood serves a wide variety of chinese stir fried dishes including seafood. It is rather pricy compared to other similar places, but the service and standard of food is worth it. Make sure you have a reservation if you have a party of 4 or more. Certain dishes require pre ordering so its a good idea to check the website out before going
5
Went to this restaurant with some skepticism - another restaurant hyped up by the millennials as I see many raving posts in social media.Located in an industrial estate, the aircondition sitting area is limited. The ambience akin the "off the beaten track" place, but the quality of food served beats many Michelin stars restaurants.New Ubin Seafood is one of the few places that I truly enjoyed every dish served! It may appear unassuming at first but the first mouth will send your taste buds dancing.Must try: Garlic baked crab, Herbal Soup Prawns, Salted Egg Squid
5
Good food overall. What makes our dining delightful is the excellent service from Francis (he's part time employee). He went beyond our expectation in servicing our requests and the passion in customer delight. Hope the management recognize this employee as an asset and recognize him in a big way.
4
We were lucky to get a table for 2 for lunch without reservation on a public holiday. We only tried the steak as we read that the portion was big (including the fried rice). The steak was good (while eaten hot) and reasonably priced for the portion. However, I was a little upset to pay for the service charge (when service was practically not required, and the outdoor sitting was not air-conditioned)
4
Went for second time yesterday, as usual the place was super crowded. So don't try your luck to walk-in without any reservation, especially on weekends. Super super love the steak and the "Heart Attack Rice", would love to be back again for more! Affordable price with great foods 
4
Simple dishes cooked to perfection, bringing the natural flavour of the fresh ingredients to great taste. The Angus beef is well grilled that it melts in your mouth, while the aroma of rice fried with the extricated beef fats is intoxicating. The chilli crab well cooked with flavourful, rich sauce is finger-licking good. The fried bee-hoon is coated with the great wok-hei of the skillful chef
3
First time to this so much talk about restaurant. Food indeed good especially beef steak, Sri Lanka crabs. However, I was very much put off with the sight of filth and stench of lavatory. I hope they take pride in decorating and maintaining the toilets too as they have done tastefully with the food and restaurant layout. Keep it up
4
On 28/2/16,my family had lunch at the new ubin seafood restaurant.We reserved a table at the aircond room, which was packed with customers. We had a nice seafood lunch. We ordered 3 varieties of crab of different flavours. We ordered chilli crab, salted egg crab and garlic crab. We had hongkong steam soon hock fish, baby kalian, barbeque tiger prawns, fried rice and chicken. A great place to have seafood and crab
4
This restaurant is simply the best place for seafood, especially XL Sri Lankan crabs.The must-try dishes are XL Sri Lankan Crab (chilli or garlic baked), foie gras steamed egg, boss bee hoon, hokkien mee special, ribeye steak, steamed squid and kaya toast. There are wines, which go very well with the seafood. I usually call at least a day before to reserve a table on normal days, and at least a week before on public holidays and eves. It is a very crowded, noisy and busy restaurant. Please do not expect high class service or comfortable seating here.Lastly, do not miss this place if you are a tourist as it stands as one of the iconic gems of the Singaporean food culture
5
Situated in the middle of nowhere, the last place you'd expect to find a diamond in the rough, I've been here twice and we're planning to make it thrice next month. The first time was with 30 people and the food was excellent, we must've had everything on the menu, needless to say the seafood was the really good, especially the crabs, they also specialise in meats, pork ribs etc. There is also a cellar of sorts and whisky is the drink of choice, the owner did impart his knowledge and made some great recommendations. A great experience at this excellent spo
5
One of my favourite restaurants in Singapore. Best to go with a big group of people as you can sample a large number of dishes and be sure to bring your own booze. Remember to book well in advance as this place is very popular even though it is in the middle of nowhere (an industrial estate amongst car repair workshops). Would advise to go for one of the few rooms in the a/c area as the outside can get very hot and stuffy.Favourite dishes include:- Madagascan prawn sashimi- Carbonara (yes strange order at a local SG restaurant)- Steak and accompanying "Heart Attack Rice"- Garlic GrabHighly recommended
5
New Ubin is one of the best hidden jewels in Singapore. The restaurant is housed in an industrial/residential area, Sin-Ming area, just off Thomson Road which is not easy to find. It is completely out of the way and hard to get to, unless you're driving. The food is traditional sumptuous and authentic Singaporean cuisine in a casual, family-friendly environment. We ordered Simple food, such as chilli crab, black pepper crab and garlic crab ,also salted egg yolk squid, barbecued king prawns, razor clams , kang kong, fried chicken and chilli eggplant, all radiantly cooked and served with a smile.It's not like a restaurant located in the orchard belt, but is well worth a visit. The facilities are basic, so don't expect luxury, but the atmosphere is dazzling, and the service is friendly, even when itâ€™s unproductive. You can take your own alcohol, but we were surprised too by the extensive and fairly reasonably priced wine list on offer. Definitely worth a visit, especially if you want a change from the normal and a delicious meal. Price is affordable and worth going back again. I would happily go back again soon. i promise that it will be an unforgettable experience
5
Again i rarely give 5 stars review but this restaurant earned it despite it out of nowhere location (I certainly cannot find this restaurant without my local Singaporean friends) We ordered Chinese New Year Set Menu for 10 people for $488 ++ and it was uniformly delicious from appetizer to dessert, total it was 8 foods (noticed they use a lot of "8" because it was Chinese Lucky Number).The appetizer for all of those who celebrate Chinese New Year (Imlek) was Yu Sheng (a combination of a lot of shredded vegetables with rare salmon, peanuts, sauce etc mixed together (sort of like salad)). To be honest with you Yu Sheng never tasted excellent just weird many things combined into one but out of respect for tradition it tasted ok.Next was fish maw soup and shark fin soup, both were quite good (I felt both soup was the same just one added fish maw)Now here come the Phoenix Chicken which was excellent and then Black Halibut Fish Fillet both were excellent.What truly elevated this restaurant was their seafood. We get super delicious salted egg XL Crab. Not only the crab was delicious (not too salty; just perfect) but it was gigantic in size ! Perfect for 10 people. The other seafood in the set menu was Boston Lobster which was super juicy & fresh. Size wise again it was enough for 10 people. Mind you to cook for 10 people wasn't easy and to cook consistently for 10 menu items certainly need perfection (& by the way the restaurant was pack and I bet most of them will order this set menu to celebrate Imlek. So imagine cooking for at least 200 people at one time ! )Amazingly they also throw US Angus Rib Eye Steak for good measure ! as if all the good seafood they served weren't enough !I think the value for money in this restaurant was 5 stars not only for the foods were delicious & abundant but for the service which were also excellent.By the way they also have a stellar wine stock to accompany theirs excellent seafood selections.Happy Chinese New Year 
5
Excellent evening with a surprise of top quality steak and ribs USDA in addition to a selection of crab and other seafood.
4
It's was a surprise to me when I arrived this place. It's near to HDB and industry area. But u can see many people in and out of the place. The place is better than a coffee shop yet not a classy restaurant. It's just comfortable. We ordered the beehoon crab, their popular steak, bamboo clam, oyster egg and stingray. The price is reasonable and the good is good
3
The restaurant is in an industrial area, the decor is minimum but the place is very popular, so book ahead. Even then you may be squashed at the busy door way. I would suggest going by taxi as parking seems at a premium. The food was very mixed. The steak and prawn dishes were outstanding, but the ham dishes were over smoked. The menu is very extensive and quite expensive. The couple who we were with loved it, so very much a personal taste
5
I reviewed best steaks in Singapore before leaving the UK and as I didn't want to pay an absolute fortune to eat in one the big name steakhouses, this sound of this place really appealed to me.As this was to be for my husbandâ€™s 50th birthday we got all dressed up and caught a cab to the restaurant. On the restaurant website there was a picture of a ramshackle sort of place accessed via a walkway over water.......we were really surprised then to be driven to a very industrial area and dropped off outside a car repair garage!We found it hilariously funny that this was a real locals sort of place and definitely not for dressing up so we stood out like sort thumbs. BUT it was worth it! The steak was heavenly and way up there is my top 10 best ever steaks and I have eaten a lot of steak in a lot of places around the world.A real experience.I realised afterwards that the photo I had seen on the website was of their original restaurant, hence the name New Ubin! Oop
3
Highly recommended by colleagues. Went for the crab promo of buy 2 get 1 free. Waited for additional 40mins for the free crab and reason was ....can't cope due to crowd. Pls, the place is crowded most days and walk ins are not encouraged. This is sufficient ground to ensure you have enough man power.The place closed at 10pm but we were served the free crab at 9.50pm and yet the workers tried to clear our table almost immediately after serving our last dish.Spoil my day as itz supposed to be a birthday celebration for my gal.Disappointed
5
The decor doesn't say much but your taste buds will tell the true tale. Call ahead. Sitting difficult at times due to high wait. Parking is also difficult. We had the pork satay, lobster sashimi , lobster broth soup, deep fried calamari and salted egg coated squid for appetizers. Main entrees were ribs, steak, beef gravy fried rice , fried bihon and bread with kaya spread. Excellent wine stock. We had 5 bottles of 2004 wines ranging from Shiraz , ect. They have decanters to allow reds to breath. Manger very knowledge on his wines. Staff n owner very friendly.
4
The restaurant is located in an industrial/residential area which is not really accessible, but it was really crowded. We ordered the baked garlic crab which was something different from the usual fare. The garlic was baked to perfection and tasted like potato instead. The pepper crab and ribs are delicious too. Price is affordable and worth going back again
4
We were 9 in n umber including 3 kids aged 11-17. We have been here a few times before and found the service patchy at best. Much better this time. A waiter called Eric was particularly friendly and helpful. We ordered the suckling pig a few days in advance as required. This is a dish I have had in Hong Kong and the Philippines on several occasions. New Ubin's version was nice but very fatty relative to the amount of meat and was quite oily. Don't get me wrong, when I order a suckling pig, pork fat is what I am after but this was so rich. A real hit with the 11 year old mind you They had their usual special of buy 2 mud crabs and get one free. We went for 2 chili and 1 white pepper. All good without being standouts. Had the steak as well which is always good. The Kang Kong with belecan was delicious as was the eggplant dish. An anti vegetable eater in the group really enjoyed this as they are very crispy with a fair amount of chili heat. One of our party only drinks vodka. Note- they don't have vodka. Restaurant was packed- as per usual and it was a lively fun evening with their very relaxed BYO policy. I think the vodka drinker still enjoyed the evening
5
This is a gem - simple food brilliantly cooked and served with a smile.Situated on an industrial estate, surrounded by auto shops, this does not look promising initially, and it has no view.BUT bear with it - take your own wine , settle in and select from a great array of seafood and more western meats.The salted egg yolk squid is superb, as are the barbecued king prawns. Oysters, razor clams, lobster....you name it, they have it and cook it to perfection.The beef is fabulous and served with rice fried in its juices, and the ribs are tender with the perfect BBQ sauce.Plastic chairs and plates, a great buzzing atmosphere, a good price - but book in advance since it gets full all the time.A little way out of the centre of time but every bit worth the effort
4
Free Parking! one of the best perks of eating at New Ubin. Initially it seems like a strange location to have a restaurant, but I believe the restaurant has been there for a long time and they actually have both aircondition and al fresco seating. The restaurant is very casual and you do not have to worry about the dress code at all. the menu is a bit strange and it as it has jap food, western food and also local food. One of the key dishes is the heart attack rice where they serve angus beef and the sauce and fat that comes from the steak will be used to make fried rice. Indeed it is a must try. The foei gras with poached egg was also a nice dish, served uniquely in a coffee cup. One thing that didn't go so well was the sashimi prawns. They were large and looked amazing, but the prawns didn't taste so good and a few people at our table had stomach upsets after that. Perhaps we should not have sucked all the brains out of the prawn heads. Spent about $50 a head with a group of 8 of us and i must say its quite a classic place which you can go pretty often. Simply drive up there with your flip flops, and enjoy the casual setting with the great food
4
Visited with local friends as there was promotion for buy two (crabs) get one free. We ordered three kinds of recipe for Crabs and they are all very good. The Ba-Ting fish was excellent yet a bit high price.
4
Rustic restaurant in midst of the industrial estate. Beef steak also available plus Chinese Zi Char. Even satay is available. West and east available. Relative affordable family lunch.

Love their usual suspects - beef and beef fried rice. Mee goreng has a nice stirfry "wok hei" and isn't overly sweet or spicy. Must have their garlic baked crabs! Great value and quality for the price you pay

Seriously good Singaporean seafood, supplemented by excellent steaks and lamp chops. Strongly recommend this popular eatery, with brisk service, in an untypical location off the beaten track. Good selection of wines. Be prepared to get your fingers dirty on the irresistible crabs

Went there for dinner with a group of friends. The aim of the dinner was to eat crab bee hoon. However what impressed us the most was the beef steak which was amazing. The crab bee hoon turned out to be too soupy.Overall we were impressed with the menu as they have all type of food from Korean, seafood, Indian, western etc.. You are literally spoilt for choice. We order 7 dishes for 6 of us. The best dishes were the beef steak and prawn paste chicken wings. The other dishes were ok.. The crab beehoon was abit disappointing as it was abit too watery.Service there was good. You are allowed to bring your own wine. Parking for a lot might be a bit troublesome as it took a while to find a lot. There were a lot of low rise car workshops. Overall good dinner. Interesting menu. Hope to try other dishes

This restaurant is my go-to place for large family gatherings or office functions. I can easily custom-make my menu, service is always excellent. There are many air-conditioned seating areas. The best thing about New Ubin is the creativity of the chefs. Expect trusted local favourites, but be open to try new dishes, you won't be disappointed

You won't find many restaurants in Singapore that offers Chinese Food and Angus Beef Steak in one place, but this is one, and a good one at that!Prior to visiting this place, I have always thought that they are just a usual hawker centre stall situated beneath an HDB housing block, but it turns out that they got the whole block 27 to themselves having options for an indoor/airconditioned and outdoor seating. The place is like an upgraded hawker centre but still wont be the place if you are into cozy places where you want a good conversation with your companion (Definitely not for first time dates). The place can be really noisy when it is full packed.The food is amazingly good (At least the ones we've tried). Flavorful and plenty of servings. What stands out for me is the sinful Squid in Salted Egg Yolk. It is so sinful as it is overladen with golden salted egg yolk and there's not a part of the squid that is not smothered with the sinful sauce. It is very satisfying! Definitely the best salted egg yolk dish I've tried yet. Another stand out is their Angus Beef Steak cooked into perfection! It would definitely rival those highly commercialized steak houses around the city. It comes with Fries and a plate of the Beef Fried Rice which i believe is cooked in beef fat (Yes! Sinful!) and bits of beef. The grains are not overcooked, still firm and yet soft to the bite. It has an amazing flavor similar to that of a claypot rice but less the burnt rice that hardens and stucks between your teeth when eating. It's just the flavors and it is so good! The Fried Brinjal (I didn't even realized that it's Brinjal) and Stir-Fried Kailan are not bad and are worth trying. We didn't order crabs this time but would definitely try on our next visit.As for the price, it is on a bit of a high side for a usual Cze Czar place. They do not show on the menu the prices of the dish so you better be ready when paying time comes.You would wanna book early prior to coming over. I do not suggest walk-ins. As the place could really be packed and there are very less chances of getting seated if you do not have reservation. We just walked-in and fortunately we went early (just after they opened for dinner on a sunday) so we were seated to a table that we should vacate before 7pm which is quite a rush for us. Better book early, I suggest.Parking is plenty within the vicinity. There is a high possibility that you could get one especially if you are there early around 5:30-6:00pm, just before the throngs of diners comes before 7pm

Hosted guest from overseas here. No problem with reservation and they send reminder via sms one day before. Ordered beef, beef oiled fried rice, Chilli crab, grilled crab and satay. Service is fast and friendly. Owner came for a quick talk, and we had cheese in his wine chiller!

Good food. I like the causal setting and service. Great place if you prefer to bring your own wines. No corkage and they will still serve you e wine glasses n ice bucket.Am only disappointed that food standard not consistent. Went couple of times n encounter once food served not as well prepared as other times
5
A great place for seafood, but also amazing meats. We had very good chili and black pepper crabs, yummy salted egg squid, fantastic fried noodles, crispy pork knuckle, deep fried chicken wings... everything was really tasty. The service was speedy and kind, giving us lots of advice on what to order. We brought our own wines, but they also offered us some passito wine from Sicily and a cheese board. We'lll surely be back next time we are in Singapore
5
Buy 2 crabs get 3rd free! Just as well, as I have so many favourites. I love the white pepper crab and the chilli crab, and oh there's the ginger crab, and the black pepper crab..... I could go on. They're all fantastic.

We’ve followed the Ubin guys around Singapore for years. I have yet to find better seafood anywhere. Its all about the food of course but the location makes it more fun. Call it rustic if you want but once in the restaurant it doesn’t matter. Crab superb, as is everything, always. SM and the boys are wonderful. I was asked why I hadn’t been in ages and was told I served you on that table over there last time. This occasion we were with a big group of friends. Wow! Some off menu specialities..astonishing. Don’t know what more to say. I will not take friends to east Coast to be ripped off..get the real thing at Ubin
5
Located in a neighborhood surrounded by car repair shops, the food is so true in Singapore taste. The USDA Ribeye steak, salted egg crab, Boss beehoon, Prawn paste chicken, Hokkien Mee, pork knuckle are divine but heart stopping stuff. The only dish that didn't have a kick was the Chilli crab, a bit average. They are so popular you have to book two weeks in advance and you can only stay for one and half hour. Not a romantic ambience very local rustic but definitely a foodie haunt
5
I was taken to this restaurant by locals, since I wanted to taste authentic Singapore food.The owner is very friendly and the atmosphere is very relaxed, one must not be scared by the confusion, since the food is excellent.I enjoyed everything but the best was the lobster Sashimi and lobster noodles. Great place, hope to go back one day
4
recommended by a friend who is a local resident. Location is awkward as in the middle of an industrial area but the website provides decent directions and map. The crab was my main aim and was excellent. I also sampled bamboo/razor clams and stingray, which was a revelation to me! The menu in general was extensive and a little pricey but worth it
4
The restaurant is quite out of the way in an industrial estate. Most of the tables are outside although there is a small air conditioned section which I understand needs to be booked way in advance. The quality of the food is fantastic - we had two types of crabs (chilli and black pepper), several types of noodles, beef, veggies... Very satisfying experience. The staff is very friendly and helpful. On a Friday night, this place was very packed, so book in advance
5
This place is out of town but absolutely brilliant seafood. The chili and pepper crab are a must. We also tried oysters, satay, fish roe, steak, lamp chops, and a few other things, none of which disappointed. Superb value for money. Very authentic and very good

Didn't know what to expect, my business partner arranged a dinner in Serangoon(kind of the central heartland area of Singapore) at a restaurant I had never heard of. Pulled into what appeared to be an industrial park with car repair shops around and old clunkers, etc. The space is open air but covered and then has Air conditioned private rooms, too. One of the party preferred AC so we had a private room in the back and the owner happened to be at the table next to ours. He came over and said hello and we all had a drink and then the food started. I assumed this would be a Singapore seafood type experience, but this was an international expo :) We had foie gras in an egg custard, very very rich and wouldn't order again but very happy i tried and would recommend to everyone to try once. An amazing and very different green vegetable that looked like a wrinkled butter bean and was very dense - can't describe the taste, but unlike anything i have ever tried before. We had an amazing sliced rib eye, house smoked pork(Where the heck am I, back home in Georgia?), beautiful crabs, and I left a very very full and happy customer.I sent my friends there for their anniversary and they loved it and came back with nothing but great things to say - they live in Bali and come in every so often- officially their favourite singapore restaurant now.Our first baby is on the way, so I am waiting until she is born and then my wife and I willl go back for round two

I was introduced to this restaurant by a local friend, who's quite the 'bon viveur', and now I never miss a chance to dine here whenever I am back in SIngapore. It's the classic local combination of exquisite food, with fast and efficient service, no-nonsense surroundings and quite out of any normal restaurant area. In fact, it can be hard to find and most taxi drivers seem oblivous to its existence. Google it and take the directions with you!BYOB, though you can buy alcohol there. Food: the signature dishes are crab, sirloin steak (with rice cooked in the dripping) and crispy chilli aubergine! The steak alone is worth the trip!Definitely book a table
4
Visited here with some friends for dinner. Ordered their famous crabs, ribeye steak and some others. The steak is very tasty and is highly recommended.
5
I went with a group of ten colleagues who live all over SE Asia, and we all agreed that the food was delicious, especially the excellent crab - we had chilli crab, black pepper crab and garlic crab in the 3 for 2 deal - but also the kangkong, fried chicken and chilli eggplant dish! The restaurant is based in what looks like a former naval base in the heart of a big industrial estate outside the city. It's not like anywhere else I've been in Singapore, and is well worth a visit. The facilities are basic, so don't expect luxury, but the atmosphere is brilliant, and the service is friendly, even when it's inefficient.!You can take your own alcohol, but beer wasn't particularly expensive.Definitely worth a visit, especially if you want a change from the norm and a delicious meal - I would happily go back again soon

The thing that I enjoy the most about New Ubin is that it is one of the most relaxed restaurants in Singapore serving what I consider to be the best local style food around. They also have some speciality dishes that you need to try. The service is attentive and relaxed, there are no airs and graces here. When you arrive for the first time you will thing what the ... The restaurant is situated within an industrial estate and the tables and chairs inside are the same as those provided in the better appointed hawker centres. But don't leave, you are about to have one of the best meals you will have in Singapore at very non-Singapore price, it is great value for money. Our dinner for 6, which included some speciality dishes, cost us around SGD260, this did not include alcohol as New Ubin has the best corkage deal in town, there is no corkage :)The wine list is also pretty good, but bringing your own wine is not a problem, they also have good quality glassware and decanters if needed.I have eaten there many times and have not had a bad dish yet! My favourites include the Black Angus Rib Eye, Salt and Pepper Squid, Boss Bee Hoon, Carbonara, Live Lobster Sashimi, Pork Knuckle, Kang Kong and Baby Kai Lan, to list a few.If you are visiting Singapore, give New Ubin a call and book a table, you will not regret it

You know the conflict you get when you come across a good restaurant. If you share it too much it will get crowded and hard to get a table. This is one of those times. These guys probably brought local cuisine to a whole new level. The mastery of wok-hei brings another layer to every dish. Every familiar dish tastes better. Fried baby squids are more crispy. Cereal in the cereal prawns is more fragrant. Western steak is crispy on the outside and soft (medium rare) on the inside, despite the cut is clearly not top grade, the chef was simply able to bring the best out of it. Try the fried bee hoon and beef fried rice too. BBQ ribs was above average too. Be adventurous with the menu, you can't go wrong.

Fresh NZ oysters to start the meal and keep the appetite going.Ordered 3 types of crabs for their buy 2 get 1 free promotion. Their Chili and Butter-Cream was mediocre. Garlic baked was slightly more interesting but not good enough for me to come back here again. Had sambal Kang Kong which is one of the better ones we had tried. The rest wasn't worth mentioning. For a party of 7 having average tze char food fare, it's considered pretty expensiv
1
We read about this place in a Seabourn magazine and it waxed lyrically about it. We made a reservation and duly turned up.The staff were pleasant, the food very poor, the entire experience was bad. I note another reviewer commented on hygiene. The toilet was filthy. In all the years I have been travelling to Singapore I have never experienced such a bad restaurant on all counts even in the late 1970's.Oh and to finish the evening I ended up in one of the private hospitals with food poisoning
4
2nd time visit and went on a tuesday night with my friends. service was good and prompt. ordered kailan, mee goreng, hotplate tofu and their signature beef. oh mine the beef was even better than the first time I tried, which I went on a crowded Saturday. In all, a decent place which I will go back again.however, the price was expensive for what many will consider just tze char food. Spent $30 per pax for 5 pax
5
I like places which give good food....and the ubin serves great food!Its foodie heaven...Each dish had a unique flavour.Service is great, The ambience is all about food, family and friends.You can get your own alcohol , for regulars they store it on the premises too. good collection of scotch and wines.Wonderful place, will happily recommend. Little on the pricey side though
3
I was recommended to this restaurant through a group of really awesome friends. They have been raving about the beef and hokkien mee. tried both but found the beef a little too salty. but i have to say these people are really generous with the portions. service staffs were alright and helpful but a little slow when we tried to place order for our 2nd drink. Price is acceptable and not overly priced :) great for all occasions :
4
the food was excellent even the location isn't where you would expect a high quality seafood restaurant. However I went there with lock friends and was positively surprised and impressed. Even they are well known for the seafood the steak they serve was for me the best dish. Order a variety of meals and share so you can have a taste of everything
5
This place is always busy on any night, whether in the air-con room or the hot and humid outside. To ensure a table, book way in advance or go before the crowd. All the food I have tried is good.
5
Great food, great hosts, reasonable pricing, NO CORKAGE!
Try the beef (a must), mutton curry, hokkien noodles, cai-por hor-fun, satay, and foie gras egg special!
5
When we told the concierge that we wanted to go to the restaurant's address, he queried whether we were sure and commented that guests do not normally go to that area! We advised that a local friend was meeting us there for dinner and highly recommended it. The location and decor is not why you go there. The service is terrific and is focused on local inhabitants. They are the vast majority of the clientele. The location is in the middle of an industrial area that focuses on car panel beating. It is subject to the government ownership and likely redevelopment in the near term.The food however is an interesting east meets west blend. We were fortunate to meet the owner who has devised each plate himself. He has a true passion for food and wine. The garlic crab is fantastic - delicious, distinctive and all eaten - as is the US beef - cooked rare and therefore not normally eaten by my wife and she ate it and found it delicious. We took advantage of the free Bring Your own wine policy and loved the french and italian wine that we had with the tasty dishes. The prices of the meals are extremely low for any tourist, and very reasonable for the food quality
2
If you only want taste and value for money then you might like this place but if you are like me who considers ambiance, crowd, hygiene and location then you are in for a disappointment.There's a lot of variety of sea food available but its located in an industrial area.Restaurant feel like a food court (cheap eating places spread across Singapore) and for that also you need a reservation. Unhygienic environment, tables and lousy cutlery and plates. Its a family run restaurant so their staff is all family members and mostly young school going kids running here and there in confusion.Had heard a lot about it but just for food I cant go back to this place and would definitely not recommend it to any tourist

3rd time at this hidden gem. Was there twice for lunch and this time back for a birthday dinner.Food was great as usual - Boss bee hoon, Fried Kai Lan, Salted egg squid, Signature steak and fried rice, Hokkien mee, Garlic prawns..A few of our favourites and they didn't disappoint.Although it was a busy night, there were sufficient wait staff. And they allowed us to cut the birthday cake there without hastening us too much.
5
What amazing food in the heart of government housing and car repair shops. While all the food was fantastic, the foie gras served in egg yolk stands out. And of course, don't forget the crab.We reserved a table a month in advance to make sure we got a large table in the air-con room. The downside would be having to eat outside in a rather hot and humid area that has little breeze. But that would be better than not getting a table at all. You must book in advance
5
Brought my parents here as a first paycheck treat. The surprising thing was that they seated us in the wine cellar room for 5 of us. It was due to the other tables in the air-conditioned area being too large to accommodate our small group.Waitress was helpful but not really proactive in recommending dishes as what other people had mentioned. Overall, the food was really good. I especially liked the Wagyu beef steak, although I was abit doubtful if the amount we were served was 600g in total! It was heavenly though.We ordered the 2 crabs + 2 slipper lobsters (crayfish) promo. My family enjoyed the crabs immensely (Garlic + Salted egg). Black pepper slipper lobsters were pretty good but not really up my alley. We also ordered the HK Kailan special which was pretty good as well. However, this was served earlier and so we were stuck with eating just veggies for awhile.We also ordered a Large crispy baby squid, but what came in the end was Scottish squid. We did not know this and hence proceeded to eat what we assumed was crispy baby squid...until the bill came. As it was charged by per 100g, the price of that dish was pretty hefty. It was disappointing then.What really made this disappointing experience so much better was the fact that the restaurant actually sent an SMS for review of the overall dining experience. I responded and long story short, I was refunded for the squid dish. Thank you Josephine for actually reading the feedback and acting upon it. My family and I will definitely be back the next time round for some delicious food again :

Service was great. I suppose we were fortunate to have an attentive and cheerful waiter which made the whole dining experience all the more pleasant. Yusof took initiative to suggest the appropriate sizes of the dishes to order. He was also attentive when informed of some allergies of the group members. He immediately went to check with the kitchen if the brinjal dish had honey when he learnt that one of us was allergic to it. Another person could not eat prawns and he reminded us that the mee goreng had prawns in it. The food on the whole was very tasty but really too oily for my liking, especially the brinjal delight and prawn paste chicken. The Sri Lankan crabs were rather worthwhile as you get one free if you order two - that worked out to be just $76 for 3 crabs and we chose to cook them in two styles on Yusof's suggestion. We opted for the chilli crab and the garlic crab. The chilli crab was delicious. The garlic crab was really flavourful but way too salty. When the manager (or perhaps he was the owner himself) who was nearby heard our feedback, he immediately had Yusof take the dish away and replace it. We were served a fresh dish and it did not taste so salty this round. He explained that that was how the dish was suppose to taste but acknowledged that it was probably too salty by our standard. We were impressed with their effort to accommodate us. The cereal prawns were huge and fresh but the cereal was strangely too sweet, like too much sugar went into it. The pork collar was really tasty and fragrant. So was the salted egg squid. The prawn paste chicken was also too oily. The spinach in the three egg spinach was bitter but that is probably not the fault of the restaurant.Overall, I would consider the food delicious but with Chinese food, sometimes tasty food also tend to be too oily. It would be great if they go easy with the oil

Celebrated a birthday with family. First time visit but our second attempt at reservation. Definitely reserve before heading to this joint in an industrial estate. Drive in at Block 26 and you will find it at the far end.We are a party of 6 and ordered 9 dishes costing $300. The most expensive are the Sri Lakan XXL crabs; garlic bake and classic chilli crabs at $91each. Liked the garlic bake crabs better. Had fried man tou ($1each) to go with gravy. Tried both Fried Hokkien Prawn noodle special and Boss Beehoon. Prefered the burnt taste of the beehoon. The Oatmeal cereal prawns at 300gsm was only $18, 5pieces quite cheap. Do give the Salted Egg Squid a miss, it was plainly salted egg yoke coating the squid, tough and bland ($14). Har cheong kai ($14) and Kai Lan ($12) was ok. Overall, we enjoyed the dinner, some hits and misses. Rather reasonable at $50ave per pax with drinks. Will be back to try the steak and fried rice.
5
A $20 taxi ride via a few back streets and u-turns eventually got us to this little semi hidden gem in an industrial estate opposite a panel beater but given it was a Monday night the place was humming with tables of 6/8/14 people so clearly the locals must love it !!!S$9:00 for a 700ml bottle of Carlsberg was a good find and the Saint Claire SSB from NZ was a little pricey @ S$45 but eminently drinkable!Crispy squid was not what we expected but absolutely true to description... whole baby squid fried until ... crunchy...S$14Slightt mix up with rhe angus rib eye saw us hooking into the beef fat infused fried rice and then moving on to the Wasabi prawns.... $9:00/100gms so S $27 for 4 bigguns that I can still taste now!!! Great!Rib eye arrived cooked as requested (Med-rare) and gorgeous melt in the mouth Angus that would rival Wagyu for taste and tenderness...accompanied by a nice dijon sauce and some caramelized onions this was a highlight and so filling we left the wedges and dead horse (tomato sauce) be ause we were STUFFED! S$200 For two inc drinks and 2xTaxi fares seemed like good value - highly recommend by these two Aussie
4
For those who love good foods without looking at the ambience. Must try the crab with Garlic, the wagu steak and fresh durians for the season!
4
Nice crab and other stirred fried dishes! Started the dinner at 5:45 pm and left at 7:10 pm. Couldnt quite believe as more efficient and pressed than HK. Like it.

My husband and I had New Ubin Seafood recommended by a friend of ours who used to live in Singapore. Based on his view of it being the 'best crab in Singapore' how could we not give it a go?!?!? It's pretty far out of the way if you're staying in town but we decided to take the 30 minute cab ride to have dinner here and while it was packed (we had to book) and the food was good, I'm not sure if it was worth the journey. Granted 30 mins in a cab isn't much but when good chilli crab is plentiful in Singapore I'm just not convinced we needed to go quite so far out of town. It was relatively inexpensive but you are still paying by the kg rather than a set price... For those keen to go the food is good and staff were friendly and helpful. At this restaurant you are certainly eating with the locals which is always nice
5
Excellent Father's Day dinner at this great zhi char coffee shop/restaurant serving local and western dishes. Extremely packed and reservations essential. Obscure location in Sin Ming industrial estate but not hard to find, hence the crowd. Ribeye with beef fried rice, hokkien mee, excellent crispy pork knuckle, foie gras satay, salted egg squid were all excellent! BYO as well
4
It's well-known that if you choose to eat where the locals eat, you can't often go wrong. And New Ubin Seafood bears out this old adage very well. It's currently located in the former canteen building of an industrial estate, certainly not as idyllic as its origins on quiet Pulau Ubin. But by word of mouth, it's grown quite a reputation for churning out delicious local favourites, often with a style that's evolved over the years. Fans love the shrimp paste chicken, kai lan (Chinese kale) special, Hokkien mee special (the health-conscious should beware that they're fairly liberal with the crispy pork lard), mee goreng, garlic-baked Sri Lankan crab, and squid fried with salted egg yolk. That's not to say that the menu doesn't also include some sophistication. Check out the crispy pork knuckle (Bavarians, eat your heart out!) and the angus beef steak. They do have menus of course, but in the event that these are temporarily unavailable, just refer to the static menus chalked onto the walls of the building. Seating's mostly in the fan-cooled section but if you do get to eat in the air-conditioned section, don't forget to check out its ceiling that's lined with empty egg cartons - a nice touch
5
If you want local food, you won't get any more local than this. No frills, in a strange location, in an even more strange building. This is basic local eating and it was fabulous. Slick service, great depth and choice to the menu, and not at a bad price either. The place was packed with locals which speaks volumes its self, booking is recommended. This is basic dinning, but that's what's makes it a great experience.
3
New Ubin is usually full so do call early to make reservations. Service is friendly and attentive. But you don't go to a restaurant for its service but rather its food. SGD35 for five small bottles of beer with a complementary dish of shrimp paste chicken wings is good value. Chicken wings were well marinated with crispy skin, but could have been hotter. The wings were likely cooked in a batch but not served on the fly. Then the signature dish of the restaurant: Sri Lanka Crab. For normal crabs it costs SGD38/crab (500-700g) while for XL crabs it costs SGD7/100g (1.5kg - 2.5kg). They have promotional offer for ordering two normal crabs with the third one free. Since the three crabs can be prepared in three different styles so we went for that instead of one single XL crab. We picked three styles: White Pepper, signature Baked Garlic and Bee Hoon Soup with milk (i.e. rice noodle). We asked them to serve one by one so we may savour each dish orderly. To our surprise all crabs turned out to be very much overcooked. And the bodies and claws were all super overcooked and weak in taste which made us suspect if the crabs were either pre-steamed then chopped up before cooking in each style (judged from the look and taste), or even not freshly prepared crabs but frozen ones. Apart from the excessively overcooked meat, all the three styles were disappointingly mediocre: Bee Hoon soup pretty bland, white pepper not strong at all with wet overcooked egg white, then the signature baked garlic style looked great with abundant baked garlic but the crabs did not get much garlic flavour at all. It costed SGD150 for three persons, with three crabs, HK Kai Lan vegetable, beers + wings, 10 x satays. It is a good deal in terms of value but definitely not taste..

I came here to celebrate my sister’s birthday together with our families.We booked early to secure a table in the air-conditioned room. For Sunday lunch, the restaurant was packed and all tables were occupied.  As there were children in our group, we ordered mainly non-spicy items, so they can partake in most of the meal. We also ordered some new items that we had not tried before.Here are the highlights:- Smoked Pork Carbonara: $19. My first time ordering this. Wasn’t sure if we should order a pasta in a Zi Char restaurant, but no regrets! Served in a claypot and it easily serves 4 pax. Loved the egg yolk in the middle which you break and mix in the pasta. Smoked pork slices added a nice flavour. Recommended!- US Black Angus Ribeye Steak: $75.60. This is one of the restaurant’s signature dishes. We had it medium done and its done the way we asked for. Its served with potato wedges and fried onions and 3 dips - salt, mustard and ketchup. The beef fat was used to cook fried rice that’s served about the same time. Recommended!- HK Kai Lan Special: $18. A restaurant signature. Leaves of the kalian are sliced and deep fried with white silver fish and served atop whole kalian stems. Its crunchy and good. - Crispy Pork Knuckle: $26. This was done German style and served with a red wine reduction sauce. The pork is deboned and chopped up so you can dive into this quickly. Skin is crispy and we finished this in quick time. - Black Ink Squid: $14 for small portion. This is a new item on the menu and it was surprisingly good. I was expecting something like a squid ink pasta type of dish, but its more flavourful. The squid used are bigger than baby squid, which are cut up and cooked with curry leaves, onions and squid ink. The curry leaves imparted a nice curry flavour and I couldn’t stop at one serving. I ate quite a bit of this. - Crab: $76. The usual promotion is ‘Buy 2 crabs and get 1 crab free’. For our visit, we bought 2 crabs and got 2 crayfish free instead. We had the crabs done 2 ways: -- Black Pepper: There was little gravy for this dish, as the sauce clings onto the crab. I found the crab a little dry for my liking, compared to the crab in the chilli crab dish. -- Chilli: The chilli crab sauce wasn’t spicy and had a more tomato flavour. We also ordered deep-fried mantou (Chinese bun) which we dipped into the chilli crab sauce. For the cray fish, we had it done in salted egg yolk. The cray fish is halved length-wise. The salted egg yolk sauce is nice and it clings onto the crayfish. I used a spoon to scoop all the sauce on the shell, to enoy it more and not waste the sauce. Its good. We enjoyed our meal and left happy.The restaurant is at an obscure location, but it’s worth the visit! Recommended

Yes, you got it right. Go and order beef steak and pork knuckles instead of prawns or crabs at this restaurant. I find their crab dishes are average and not outstanding, and so are their prawn and seafood dishes. But their signature Angus beef steak is outstanding. We also ordered their pork knuckles, which I find even better than in most German eateries in town.
4
Popped in for early lunch on Mother's Day. Restaurant was fully booked but we managed to get a table on condition we finished by 12:30PM. Do call ahead for reservations if you plan to go, to avoid disappointment. Tried the boss fried beehoon (yum!!) Which reminds me of fried kway teow. Smoked pork fried rice was well executed, eggy with tender chunks of smoked pork belly, not too greasy. Also tried the deep fried fish roe, fried with sambal petai beans. Meal for two came up to just over $40. We also got the complimentary lime juice for liking their Facebook page. Will explore their wine list/cellar next time.This would be a good place for family fatherings as there are a couple of large tables that can seat more than ten.
4
The Angus beef was so juicy! Good quality at affordable price. Though a bit inconvenient to get there, I would recommend it as it worth the effort especially if a group meal - you get to sample many dishes
5
We tried 6 different dishes including the beef, and it was amazing ! The owner is also extraordinary !
5
If you are looking for a local's favorite crab house this is the place! Delicious food, decent service and value for money prices. You will see local families having dinner and few tourists or expats,

This is a really good restaurant in a really weird location. The setting - off a side street in an industrial zone, surrounded by car workshops - is bizarre, but the food does not disappoint. You definitely have to book (certainly at popular times, when it can be hard to get a table). The menu is classic Singaporean mixed with a few odd choices - like steak and chips (delicious fillet steak, beautifully cooked, served with real chips and french mustard!), all well worth a try. The hot pot was great and the caramelised baby squid was superb! Only some areas are air conditioned, so if that matters to you, then stipulate when booking. We would certainly go back when next in Singapore

Location is not what you expect of a seafood place but in busy Singapore, it might be a plus to drive in a different direction to the masses. The seafood is really more than decent. Really like the pepper crab whilst the chilli is too sweet for my liking. It also serves ribeye which seems odd but it is pretty good. The world beater here is the deep fried baby squid. It's sublime.

First off, let me say we love eating at New Ubin Seafood, because the food is certainly well worth going for. The experience is also certainly interesting, because it is located at the most unlikely of places, right smack in the middle of an industrial estate of car workshops. Having said that, it is actually quite accessible by public transport from the main road at Marymount Road if you are not driving; if you are driving however, then parking is usually tough, so you are best off parking at the MSCP at Block 22A and taking a short walk over. Food wise, they certainly serve a strange mix of items on the menu, which is probably reflective of the foodie mentality of the boss. As the name suggests, seafood is certainly big on the menu, but the surprise finds are the angus steak, the satay and the pork knuckle! The top favourites for me are definitely the steak, which is a really good piece of meat done very well (and of course accompanied by the fried rice which ONLY comes when you order the beef), and the roasted garlic crab. I particularly like the crab because it is unique to Ubin's menu, as far as I know, and I've never had it anywhere else. The full flavour of the garlic comes across in every part of the crab, to the point that I enjoy sucking on the shells when all the crab is gone; the garlic is so tender you can pop the clove out of the skin without chewing on it! The crispy baby squid is also a must try, having the right balance of crisp, sweetness and spice. The satay is also surprisingly good for a fairly upmarket place, because they use only thigh meat, and the sauce is the right consistency of chunky peanut which you can taste and feel. The only downside to this place is that when they are crowded, the bill can take a long time to come (we once waited 20 minutes for them to bring the bill). Otherwise, we have no complaints, and are happy to bring a constant stream of friends. The freebie lime juice for liking them on FB is a great advertisement. Service is a little hit or miss, depending on who is serving you. Its not the cheapest, but food quality is worth what you pay

the restaurant is located in the industry area with a lot of car workshop around the place. it is so hard to find a parking lot.the service staff do not seem to be very friendly. they did not take the initiatives to approach us to take order and we called them so many times before they came to take our orders. furthermore there was this guy at the counter who kept shouting at his co workers. not exactly the right do to do when their customers are around.however, the food make up it! i was surprised that the standard of the food is so much better than the service. if only the service can be as good as the food

We went to Ubin Seafood on last Monday. We arrived there at 9pm as we have a reservation at 9pm. On arrival to the restaurant, none of the staffs really bother or has the initiative to come over to assist us. Neither do we know the person in charge of table allocation is stationed behind a pillar until someone came to tell us. What a bad arrangement to start off with. We have ordered poached prawns with rice wine, one ribeye steak and one 'kai lan". The poached prawns are not adequately cooked. It was also not as fresh as what i had expected. I love prawns but this is the worst prawn dish i have ever eaten. I do agree that the ribeye was not bad. However, there was obviously a problem with the timing of the food served. The beef fried rice, which was supposed to be served together with the ribeye, only came after we finished the beef. No staffs actually bothered to inform us about the rice, which was supposedly served together with the beef. Due to the large crowd, the food was already cold when served.The service was really bad. The person in charge of reception was not forth-coming. No customer will know who the person in charge of reception really is. It was extremely chaotic. We have asked one waiter (i think he is a filipino) to bring us one bowl of rice. He didn't acknowledge when we requested for the rice. He just brushed us off. We then requested from another waiter. He acknowledged but the rice never came. It was only after the THIRD time we requested from the third waiter that our request was entertained. By the time the rice came, we almost finished eating. Not to mention another 15 mins wait for our bill. This again was after the second time we requested for the bill. All in all, the food was over-rated. Definitely overrated. Service is really bad. None of the waiter/waitress is really interested to serve the customers. It was one of the worst eating experience i had over the last one year.

This restaurant is located at Sin Ming Industrial Estate, where there are many car workshops. It’s the least likely place that you will expect to find a restaurant, and more importantly, a restaurant that serves good food!I was tasked to look for a place for dinner amongst my colleagues to celebrate a birthday and I selected this location. The restaurant is known for their seafood and also beef.- Deep fried Baby Squid: Baby squid deep fried till crispy and toss in a sour plum sauce. It was gone in no time amongst my group.- Hong Kong Kailan Special: This was kailan done two ways. The leaves were sliced and deep fried. It is placed atop poached Kailan, creating a two-in-one dish. Kailan is a personal favourite of mine, so I loved this a lot. The deep fried leaves remind you of seaweed. - Mussels in White Wine Sauce: Fresh NZ mussels cooked in a white wine sauce. All of us liked this dish. Mussels were fresh and plump.- Hokkien Mee: A signature of the restaurant. There’s clams, fresh prawns, pork belly and baby squid cooked with yellow noodles and thick vermicelli. The broth they used is delicious and reminded me of Campbell Chicken Soup! I was scooping up all the sauce leftover on the plate, cos I like it so much. Must Order!- Mee Goreng: This is an old-style mee-goreng, Chinese style. Simply fried with egg, fish cake and prawns with lots of ‘wok hei’. It looks appetising when it reached the table. I walked away to take something from the service table and the dish was gone! In less than 1 minute, and I didn’t get to try it. So I ordered another plate to make up for it.- US Black Angus Ribeye Steak: Served with caramelised onions, potato wedges and fried rice with beef dripping. The presentation is great. - Crabs: For the usual size crabs, there was a ‘Buy 2, Get 1 Free’ promotion. We opted for it to be done two ways:> Black Pepper: Crab meat is decent, and I find this dish spicy, cos of the pepper. The first few mouthfuls were OK, and then the pepper kicks in. I found a piece with lots of crab roe and had a good time munching away.> Salted Egg Yolk: This was similar to the salted egg yolk squid, but the salted egg yolk gravy is drier and coats the crab better and I find it tastier. It could be the cooking of the crab that the gravy simmering to a reduction. The saltiness is just nice and flavourful.- Salted Egg Squid: Cut squid slices wok fried with salted egg yolk. The salted egg yolk paste was generous and coated the whole dish. The paste is wet (not watery).- Or Nee (Yam Paste): Coconut cream on the side, and also came with soft creamy durian paste, which can be eaten on its own or added to the or nee. It was a great meal at this restaurant and I will definitely be back here again soon.We brought our own wines for the meal and there was no corkage for the wines. The service staff was also prompt to bring new wine glasses when we asked for it.Highly recommended

Coming to Singapore for over 30 years now and visiting at least once a year. I have seen how much the city changed and also the food.People always say that in earlier days the food was of better quality and of better taste. This is often the case but not for New Ubin Seafood restaurant. Seafood as it is supposed to be, fresh and original taste.As i remember it to be, an absolute must try
4
Sri Lankan Crabs, buy 2 free one. Any cooking style taste great. Must order include crabs and beef steak. Avoid fried rice and noodles.
5
This place is really a treasure! So many good food in one store!So here's the dishes I really enjoyed and must order the next time when I come:1. Steak - super yummy combo with the mustard sauce2. Salted egg squid - they are super generous with the salted egg3. Kai Lan with seaweed flakes - vegetables never taste so goodThere's one dish they said we had to order way in advance which is the egg foie gras but they had it. So I tried it, I think the truffle oil is way too much got a little gross eating it. But the foie gras is quite big piece and yummy too!Also if you like their FB page in front of them, you get a free lime juice! Will def come again
5
Had dinner on Christmas Eve with some mates. Brought along our Chivas Royal Salute.(no corkage) We ordered their signature and recommended dishes such as Scottish Blue Lobster â€“ sashimi, Fresh La Perle Blanche Oysters from Normandy, Beef Steak and others. Friendly staffs and ambience. Look for Jolene, she is an excellent host. Strongly recommended
4
Not a place for a romantic dinner. It was noisy with lots of laughter and loud conversations amongst the diners. There were lots of house specials such as Boss Meehoon which was delicious. There were some cross cuisines such as soft boiled egg with foie gras. Overall the food was delicious and with the atmosphere the place provides, it was a real insight to a visitor to Singapore. Service can be improved
4
Been here a few times recently and always impressed. Very local (in middle of auto workshop district) and quality always excellent. Great value and you can bring your own wine. But no real need to. Their wine list is decent and very reasonably priced. The steak is very good and allows you to get the hallowed product - heart attack rice. Pretty self explanatory but delicious
5
This place is the place to go for great food. Though a zhi char restaurant, it has one of the best steaks in Singapore. The other dishes like that kong ba pow was also pretty good. They have an ongoing crab offer of buy 2 free 1 and you select on how you want it cook. Service is decent though when it's crowded it can get a bit difficult to get their attention
3
My first to this restaurant. Ordered two chilli crabs and free 1 salted egg crab..you cab the flavour of crabs you want. The banner outside the restaurant says GST is absorbed. But the final bill how the gst is included. The staff said the banner is not updated. But best thing they do not charge service charge
5
My third trip and this place never fails to meet the mark. Some may comment that for a 'seafood' place it seems strange that this place is recognized more for its meats, but that has never been my complaint. The beef is cooked to perfection and even the ribs outperform many US chains over here. Don't get me wrong. The seafood here is good, just not great. It is when you couple the meats and of course attentive, smiley service that makes this place worth the effort to find and go. We finished the meal with the foie gras satay which was cooked perfectly tender and creamy with just the right chat on the outside. Mopped up the drippings with the accompanying French toast... Yum! Very very worth the 10k I am going to run soon.. Well maybe later keep it up guys
4
Went there twice in a week and the food was good!! Love the Angus beef that came with wedges and fried rice - very unique and nice, very filling!! The durian dessert was nice too, but I feel that it is a bit overpriced. Do remember to book if you are visiting in the evening or weekends!
5
We visit Singapore once every half year for business and a little trip outside our home in Bali. Crab is one our to eat list each stay in Singapore. We have now found the best place yet to eat crab! A place where the locals eat. Super tasty crab. Forget the overpriced crap crab you eat in town and head out to this place. Make a reservation coz it gets quite filled up. We had black pepper crab, garlic crab, chili crab and salty egg crab. Can't wait to go back here
4
We really enjoy our take away food from new ubin its all fresh & tasty. This place is highly recommended to all our friends. Surely, we will be back for more!
4
Tucked away in the corner of an industrial estate, this place seems perpetually crowded. Very local with excellent steak and lots of seafood. You can BYO wine but this is one for easy to drink wines.
3
We had a table for 10 on Saturday night. The place was packed. We had satay (meaty, tender and tasty), prawns in soup (bland and no taste of wine), deep fried baby squid (crisp but bland), chili crab (no oomph and the gravy was too starchy), steamed fish in soy sauce (bland and the fish was a bit chewy), beef (best dish of the night; beef was nicely seared with pink center and melted in the mouth), beef fried rice (too salty), crayfish (tasty but tough) and special kailan (tender crisp and tasty). We also ordered an eggplant dish, but it never materialized. Overall, the dining experience was just average
5
This is one of the most unique seafood restaurants in Singapore. Sure, we have the well known ones over the island and they are excellent too! But you are still missing some unique dining experience! The very first time I was invited to this restaurant, I was rather taken aback. Nestled in an "industrial" estate amongst motor workshops, you would not expect such a restaurant to dish out special platters to excite the taste buds and to satiate the culinary adventurer in you. Again I learnt never to judge any thing, and that includes such a restaurant by its "cover" and in this case by its location. Why is this a unique dining experience every time we visit? Well, we liked to be surprised by what the chef (in this case the owner) can rustle up, and he has never ever disappointed. From the succulent and fresh oysters to the most tender and fragrant beef and the tantalizing fried brinjal skin in a secret sauce and his often new and wonderful experiments and creations in the kitchen, you will be transported into a food paradise that you will never want to leave! Sure there is the menu of their popular offerings. These are good too. But my recommendation is to seek out the resident chef, give him your budget, and get him to surprise you and your guests! You will never regret it! This is the place to be to eat and be merry with drink and laughter! Do book a room for air conditioning comfort and privacy. Salut and Bon Appetit

A very unlikely place to have a good Rib eye steak but @ $12 per 100g, its worth it. I must comment however that they could provide more options for sides as their steaks only come with chips. The seafood dishes are very good too but I would do that in a separate visit as rib eye does not go too well with chilli crab for me.

We made a reservation to dine at New Ubin afer reading good reviewd on its food, especially its grilled beef. Intially, we had high expectations of the service as after making the reservation via Chope 3 days in advance , we received a sms confirmation within an hour.On the day itself, we reached the restaurant at 6.35p.m on a Wednesday evening. The restaurant was 20% full. We were assigned to a small table at the far end corner of the restaurant. When we requested to change to a slightly bigger table, we were told we could not. The reason given was that there was only 2 of us, and that the restuarant would be full.We then proceeded to place orders for the beef and steamed baby squids. After waiting for 20 mins, the beef came. It was grilled to our preference, and fairly tasty. The beef fried rice was stir fry with dark soy sauce and the beef fats, which was quite interesting. However, the steamed baby squids was a big disapointment. We have specifically wanted to and looking forward to try steamed baby squids.The steamed squids were all medium sized - nothing close to "baby" at all. When we asked the waiter, we were told "oh we only have deep fried baby squids. For steaming, only medium sized one are used". Then why did the waiter not tell us that baby squids are not available for steaming when we place our order?! If we had known no baby squids were available for steaming, we would not have ordered at all. The medium sized squids were bland and tasteless - we could only taste the garlic and soy sauce used in the steaming, a complete disappointment.  For 2 dishes (500g beef, steamed squids, 1 lime juice, 1 water), we paid a bill of $87+. We did not find it good value at all, especially with the poor service, non- aircon envrionment, misleading menu, slightly above average food. We'd rather pay 20% more to dine in a proper restaurant with much better ambience and service, and food of similar or even better quality.And by the time we left the restuarant at 7.40p.m, the restaurant was only 40% full. . . Unfortunately, this would be our FIRST and LAST time at New Ubin. We would not recommend this restuarant to our friends.

Ordered 3 types of crab - chili, salted egg and garlic baked. Seriously, this is what I call jack of all trades and master of none. None of these are up to the standard. There are many tzechar out there that can make better crabs. The black angus beef for 70 bucks are definitely not worth the money. I would have gone to a proper steakhouse to get better steak at the same price range.The service are lousy and slow. Plates and bowls are dirty. Disappointed. 4 of us spent almost 200 for such a low standard food. The place is nicely decorated and not stuffy and hot like other tzechar place. Not going back for sure.
5
The place is incredible : in the middle of an industrial car repair zone, this very very local joint serves excellent grilled beef (despite its seafood name) and also good seafood. The atmosphere is nice, weird also, And service is gentle. A different restaurant to try in Singapore
4
Order the Foie Gras Satay (min of two piece thou). It's amazingly done. Also, the beef rocks. A good almost 600g serving for the 4 of us. Can i just say it is AMAZING again? There are also a Buy 2 get 3rd free for most of the seafood , crabs, bamboo clams etc... So if you are a big seafood lover, This is a steal. Make reservation early. Dinner crowd is madness
4
You would never think that you would find fine dining in this dirty, smelly industrial zone but it is real. The food and service are quite a bit above Singapore standards. Singapore restaurants are known for having the worst service imaginable but not this place.. the staff is friendly and prompt. Our beers never went dry and food service was quick. Now- the food... I have eaten in everything from dirty food courts to high end hotel restaurants in Singapore and honestly cannot recall having better food anywhere. The US Prime Rib steak is awesome, perfectly cooked, juicy... perfect. The Chili Crab is wonderful and the dipping buns are excellent. We tried Chili and Pepper crab and both were excellent, the pork cutlet and dipping sauce was awesome and the Prime Rib alone is worth going for. You can bring your own bottle of wine if you wish... all in all- excellent place for dinner with coworkers or friends... not much for romance

Hi
Great food and local ambience. Beef can be regarded as signature dish. Fried tiny prawns is another great dish.
5
Best seafood we had for a long time (we are coming to Singapore since 1983). Try also the smoked pork neck.
1
On the table: Steamed Bamboo Clam, Salted Egg Squid, Hokkien Noodle (dark), Ngai Bai, Har Jeong Gai
Lacked of wok hei and most dishes are oily.
3
Made a rsvn for air-conditioned area for lunch on Sat. The air-conditioned area is not very big and the place looks old, it literally brings you back to the 70s/80s era. Staff were attentive and polite. Ordered the smoked pork carbonara $19, HK kailan special $12, hotplate beancurd $14, curry fish head $26 and prawn rolls $14. The carbonara was delicious, prawn rolls were quite good but the rest were just fine, not exceptional. The dishes I ordered were quite basic and I would have thought that they would do a good job since they are quite innovative with the items on their menu but it was disappointing. Although the restaurant was not full, it took quite a long time for the food to be served. Since prices were not cheap and food not fantastic, I wouldn't return again. I can find cheaper and much nicer zi char elsewhere. Also, finding parking was difficult
1
Came here first thing when it opened for lunch on Sunday at 11.30am. We only managed to leave at 2.30pm.. We ordered the same dishes for our two tables. Firstly, it took more than 25 mins to get the first dish out and it was only for one table. The following dishes also came out randomly (ie. One table got their food whilst the other did not). Other tables who came later ordered, ate their food and left whilst we were still waiting for our food. Been here many times but the food quality is noting to shout about anymore and the supervision of the manager and owner has greatly deteriorated. Spoke to a few of my friends and they also share the same.. (ie. That it's going downhill). Anyway, don't think I'm coming back here any more in the near future.
5
A friend brought a group of us here for dinner, and it was one of the best meals I've had in Singapore. It is very casual, and has way more options than just seafood. The steak I had was the best one I've had in a restaurant in Singapore. Ribs were also excellent. Service was very good and prices were reasonable for the amount of food we got
4
Very crowded place on a weekday night. Glad the food came rather quickly after ordering. More memorable dishes include the angus ribeye, foie gras satay, and chilli crab which was quite fresh. Tasty food definitely but watch your cholesterol levels ! Service is good despite restaurant running at full house 
5
I've lived in Singapore for 12 years and only just found this gem. The food is senstational especially the steak and rice, smoked pork shoulder, clam, foie gras skewers, fried aubergine, kailan done 2 ways. It is BYO so means that I don't have to remortgage. Service is good and the ambiance is great. Took a big group from work there and they loved it. What a location! Who said Singapore is boring?Maybe I should go tonight...
4
Always make a reservation here especially of coming in a big grp on the weekends. The food here is really flavourful, with the salted egg prawns and cuttlefish being the most unforgettable. And yes the heart attack fried rice too! Salivating as I recall the dining experience. If they can fully air condition the entire restaurant id have given them another star
5
New Ubin has come a long way since its humble beginnings at Sin Ming Industrial Estate. The restaurant has always been our family favorite as its menu is sure to include something for everyone. Apart from the usual seafood offering are items like crispy pork knuckle, satay, pasta, fish steamboat and their signature Angus ribeye steak which is served with a good portion of mouth-watering beef fried rice. Wine lovers will be happy to know that New Ubin is also a BYO restaurant. The setting is casual and relaxed, much like having a nice meal at home. A must-visit
2
Steak: Nothing special. Meat is tough and taste is boring. Pricy for such quality.Beef Fried Rice: Confusing taste.Satay: Our mutton satay was sour, probably gone bad. Ketupat came separately and it was a total failure, breaking off into pieces.Fried Hokkien Prawn Noodles: This is the better one of all.Stingray: Average but different from usual as they use belachan chilli (waiting time is about 90 minutes, so be prepared to wait).Shovelhead Ray: Average (waiting time about 60 minutes).Overall: Trying to be unique but nothing special, pricy at S$50 per pax. Service is good though but that's about it
5
Was introduced to this place by a colleague and the food was so good that I went back a 2nd time. It is not quite easy to find if you are not familiar with the place. It is surrounded by car workshop at Sin Ming area. Must try is the beef grill and prawn sashimi
1
The service tonight was so slow it may as well have been no service. Had to ask to order 4 times. After a very long wait, watching everyone around us get their food and tables turning over, we get served 1 rice and 1 veg and then nothing to go with it for ages. After 3 more dishes, another 30 minute wait.... Cancelled remainder of food and left with huge ill feeling for an evening spoilt.We have eaten here many times and whilst the service can be erratic this was just downright rude. Maybe we are just not welcome
1
Went for a seafood meal after sending my car for servicing opposite the restaurant. Service was the worst I have ever experienced in Singapore. They have a dedicated person just to show u to your table and will not do anything else. Vegetable was not fresh. We had to ask 4 servers for steam rice before it came. In the end we ended up having our food packed as we just could not tolerate the bad service anymore. Will never go back.
5
This is a seafood restaurant, but the best dish is widely acknowledged to be the US ribeye (along with the beef fat fried rice). Other great dishes are the boss beehoon, salted egg squid, white pepper crab, garlic crab, smoked duck. If you have a lot of moolah the Alaskan King Crab is amazing. Unpretentious service, great food, great place to go in big groups and with family. This is possibly my favourite restaurant in Singapore
2
Given that the restaurant is hidden deep inside an area surrounded by dodgy car repair shops in the suburbs, the fact that it's packed must mean it's pretty damn good. And diners were mostly local families so you can't really go wrong. So it's hard to understand why a place with average quality food and a very rude hostess could be so packed. Every dish was served cold without fail. The atmosphere was nice, resembling more of a family restaurant in Cambodia, most of the other waiters were charming and efficient
3
You wouldn't expect what we call a neighbourhood "tze char" - (that's local speak for local casual eatery that cooks just about anything in Chinese cuisine under the sun), to have the kind of following or accompanied hype this place has. Especially not with the nondescript and out of the way location in the middle of an industrial estate full of car workshops. But this place has some avid fans.The menu is unique amongst tze chars in Singapore. One highlight is the Heart Attack Fried Rice (beef fried rice made with beef drippings and served with a huge sirloin steak with caramelised onions on a wooden board). This tells you that this definitely isn't your run of the mill local eatery. If you're adventurous, try the Shovel Nosed Shark done two ways. It's an interesting menu, and you'll definitely not be alone, large crowds turn up here even on the weekends.Make sure you make your reservations. They're surprisingly organised here and there's even a host at the entrance to seat people like a proper up market restaurant
4
Was recommended by a friend and am very happy we came. Have been trying various east coast seafood places the past month to satisfy my craving for Chili crab etc. New Ubin seafood serves very good Chili and black pepper crab along with other versions. I like their chili crab. We also liked their grilled angus beef and accompanying beef fried rice. Am going back again in a few weeks to try their other dishes
3
Ok if you are foreign tourist its too much trouble to get to here and problem to get back if you don't have local cell phone to book a cab as there is no cab you can flag down unless some other comes by cab and you get the opportunity to hop in.Food is good depending on what you order and may be exotic to some westerners but not to local or localised expat eg salted egg crabs or butter crab which doesn t not come cheap at $38 a crab. We did not have the angus beef or the fried rice fried in beef lard which is kinda off limit if you worry about saturated fats or greasy fried rice. That said its the must have dish on most tables and given the large serve you probably need 2 or 3 pax to share a dish esp if you want to savour other top of list dishes. We had kalian(too oily) but stirred sweet potato leaves and taugeh were not too bad,we also ordered chin har look (deep fried soy sauce large prawns which was fresh and yummy.All in the vegies dishes are not expensive but the steak and crabs and prawns are the pricey dishes.in summary you can have some very good dish and some mediocre so how you/I rate them depends on background and experience but by and large, the better judge would be the locals whom would shun the place if it was that bad. so by that token it is so full you can walk in means the food should be good to very good otherwise they will close shop esp this is in a quiet hard to find industrial park. Last word is if you don t fancy crabs or prawns or seafood or poor service don t bother to come here as there are so many seafood restaurants along the East Coast par
4
Have been to this place twice now and have been blown away both times.The food has such variety and excellence that the name is probably the most misleading thing. Service is functional and probably the only area that doesn't stack up with a gourmet restaurant but everything else certainly does.It helps if you know someone who knows the staff or owner and ordering ahead for the best dishes is also a good idea.Go and be very surprised, it's superb
3
The rib eye and the rice that came with it was excellent. But seems that outside of these 2 dishes, that's when the proverbial slope becomes slippery.The garlic crab was a big tasteless disappointment despite the quantity of garlic lobbed into the dish. The egg yolk squid - what can I say. The sauce was poured over the cooked squid and therefore, the taste either wasn't absorbed by the squid or just doesn't match the type of seafood. The other saving grace to the beef is the cereal prawn which was fried to the right consistency.
4
A friend recommended we lunch there for the ribeye. Strange, I thought ...having steak at a Singaporean seafood joint. But after eating there twice, I now recommend this place too. The ribeye is a thick steak , charcoal grilled and then cubed before serving. Not your typical sides though, it comes with rice fried with beef fat and sweet dark soya sauce. The seafood dishes are really good too. I recommend the crab bee hoon or vermicelli and fish roe in a special shrimp sauce.
3
The crab bee hoon is awesome. I love the deep fried shrimps. It is delicious to go with the sambal. Good taking this when having some beers. The mussel in white wine is also a must try dish. Unfortunately did not get to try out the Angus Beef
4
Angus ribeye was yummy! Accompanied by the fried rice, it was certainly a lovely meal. The baby squids were pretty good too. Other seafood dishes were good, generally, including the crabs. It's the beef that is the MUST HAVE. Make a reservation early, better if it's a day ahead. They're fully booked every night
3
When to New Ubin Seafood restaurant with my family. I rate this restaurant overall was average despite service was quite good.We tried butter crab. Not so tasty despite the crab is quick fresh. Fried baby squid and fried rice with salted fish was ok. Nothing special. They ran out of tiger and Heineken beers. Only singha beer available. Not many choice of alcohol beverages.If you are going for chili crab. Go for Jumbo or long beach. Black pepper go for no signboard and butter and bee Hoon crab - go for Melben Seafood
4
Be sure to call ahead to reserve a table as this place gets very busy at dinner. Better yet, go for lunch and you get to sit in the airconditioned room! Have the usual seafood by all means - prices are reasonable. The prime steak was cold when we were there but it is something unusual and almost every table had it. I wished it had been served warm/hot but the kitchen was probably overwhelmed.Have the shovel nosed ray too - another unique dish. Portions are small and I wasn't sure if that was the usual serving. Nonetheless, preorder it if you can. Overall, good value for money and a place different from the usual seafood restaurant
4
Our local Singaporean friend brought us here by car. It is a simple restaurant located in the middle of a dingy industrial area - as we are Malaysians, it sounded like home! There was 4 of us, and during the ordering process, the staff who took our order decided to give us the smallest portions - so if you go, please ask for medium or large. We found our food portions to be unsatisfactory. The food was delicious but the portions could have been better. We brought our own wine - no corkage charge I believe. We ordered the famous Angus beef which was out of this world - clearly a winning dish in its own right. The fried rice was nice but very small in portion. We also had the salted egg squid, chili crabs, kailan, prawns and our total bill was SGD187 for 4 pax which I thought was expensive considering the teeny tiny portions.By local standards, this place is a gem. However, the seafood (portions, servings and quality) in Malaysia are superior by far

Went for Mother's Day as mum requested "Hainanese steak". Since The Ship had closed, decided to try this. We ordered the angus rib-eye. About 5-600 gm of beef with the fat mostly sliced off, served with grilled onions, yummy crispy potato wedges and a side of fried rice. The rice is special, as the is where your sliced off beef fat has been put to good use. This was the absolute highlight of the meal but the other dishes were also good, the "boss" bee hoon and diou Miao veggies fried with garlic. One disappointment, we had ordered steamed fish but it took so long - we waited for 20 minutes after everything else had been FINISHED and our dishes taken away - finally they agreed to cancel it. So honestly I have no idea how the seafood here is! But I would come back for the ribeye anytime! (And the price was fantastic, $10 p/100 gm or about $55 for our dish (including all those yummy sides)). Just don't expect service or ambience and you'll be fine

Brought my overseas colleagues to New Ubin Seafood as we did not find the food at the mainstream seafood restaurants that fantastic. .. as often recommended by many foodie websites. Saw a review by a local food writer on this deals restaurant and the menu looked very interesting. 15 of us had chilli crab, cereal prawns, salted egg oysters, beef fried rice, bamboo clams, wagyu sirloin steak, Hong Kong Kailan, baby squids, beer, fruit juices and fresh coconut. The best part of this meal was the price. It only cost us only SGD41/pax! We also realised that we could BYO and there's no corkage. Everyone have a thumbs up for this meal. We will definitely be back!

For first timers, the restaurant is hidden right in the midst of Sin Min's car workshops!Not exactly the location to find seafood.What did we Order ?-Pork-Knuckle ($24) - crispy and crunchy, I prefer the original German style-Surprisingly, one of the restaurant's famous dish is the Angus ribeye steak ($10/100gm). Fabulous taste and portion! The beef-fat fried rice is so appetising (and guilty).- The wasabi prawn is so so only**crabs and steak are on most tables**Price is very reasonable (listed on their website).Please Rsvp beforehand, as it is pack almost every evening.I would like to try their crabs and satay on the next visit

Dined with 6 family members on Sunday evening. Outlet was located off the main roads, nestled among car workshops in the Sin Ming industrial area. The restaurant is known for its crab promotion which entitles you to one free crab with every two ordered.On our visit we tried the salted egg crab, black pepper crab and chili crab. The crabs were not huge Sri-Lankans which we could usually find in other seafood joints but they were fresh. Flavours were robust without being too cloying, especially so for the salted egg crab. We also had sweet-sour pork, fried baby squids, herbal prawns (the prawns were HUGE and each bowl could only fit one eventually). Under the recommendation of the service staff we also tried Mussels De Blanc and another fried kailan leaves - leaves were interestingly shredded and fried wth small whitebaits. On the overall, food variety and quality was decent. Worth a try!

Singaporeans in the main have hugely demanding palettes. Critical, cynical and spoilt for choice they are a difficult one to appease. When you therefore come across a large eating establishment which is constantly busy and where it is essential to have a reservation, you know you have got something special there.New Ubin Seafood is not for everyone. If you favour the likes of Marina Bay Restaurants, the St. Regis, Four Seasons and Ion type places and would not be seen dead in a 'block 27' eating house amidst an industrial estate which is a hospital for ailing, crashed or dying cars,( some are totally dead) this is not a place for you. If however. you are a true gourmet where innovative, new, exciting, different flavours and textures and ultimately and simply great taste is your homage, this may be the Mother of All Restaurants for you.Mr. Pang, owner, ex accountant, bon viveur, serious whisky and wine consumer and host extraordinaire loves people who loves food. No matter that you are rich or poor (well not too poor as some dishes may set your bank balance spiralling downwards), doctors, ministers, lawyers, car mechanics (loads of these around) a banker or financier, if you are lucky enough to be attended to by the man himself, you are in for a treat. To go through the menu with all the right expletives is unnecessary and superfluous. Suffice to say, that the known dishes have been praised enough in past reviews. It is often the new and various experimental dishes that appeals. Occasionally, it misses, perhaps a little too sweet, heavy or just quite not right. Often it is spot on. Be it a fish congee or fried baby shrimps (akin to the Poole Prawn) in its entirety ( had similar dish once before in Skye Gyngell's Petersham Nurseries Cafe in UK) or plain Fried Hokkien Mee, Aurbergine Fritters, Blackened Beef Fat Rice, this is my kind of food. If Mr. Pang likes your party enough, he will bring a bottle of one of his cask whiskys to partake at the end of a meal. This is the sign that you have arrived here.Decent wines are available at decent prices for decent folk who drink indecent amounts (like us). Service when available, can be chaotic and hit and miss but this is part of the charm of this eccentric copi shop type restaurant.. It has extended into back rooms and even the sides of the building. Let us hope success and over expansion does not take it's toll in some of the most exciting and extraordinary good cooking to be found in this Mecca of a Country for gastronomy

Went to this 'off-the-beaten-track' restaurant, to get some good singapore Crab on my trip here, and was blown away by the flavour, taste and choice.Out in the wilds(?) of Singapore, nestled amongst Car repair shops, New Ubin was crowded with people enjoying seafood and other dishes. We ordered the Baked Garlic Crab, the White Pepper crab and a complimentary extra crab dish -I was blown away by the taste and tenderness of the crab, and the spices. The place was crowded, noisy nd bustling with parties and groups, but they fitted our party of 4 in. Good service by Singapore standards, and staff are happy to discuss the options and help with orders.Amazing food - do yourself a favour and go ther

Lots have been written about the beef and the pork knuckle, which have been consistently highly rated for their excellent taste and value. Owner Pang is innovative and always trying out new dishes. In my most recent visits, i tried his fish steamboat and rice porridge in claypot. Both were excellent. The fish is a fresh catch for the day, with its meat cut up for the steamboat. For the porridge, the sweetness comes from the fish bones, crabs and whatever is fresh. Remember to add lots of garnishings and condiments. Three thumbs up

A bunch of us friends decided to try the famous New Ubin Seafood Restaurant over the weekend. We heard so much of their signature dishes of various crabs dishes and with their offer of ordering 2 types of crabs and we will get the 3rd crab free. Plus, we also heard about their famous beef steak dish. Being foodies, we boldly went off on this cuisine adventure.Firstly, the place was a bit hard to find. It is deep inside a light industrial park, next to a public housing project. So, don't expect much of a scenery. Lucky we made reservations for he 4 of us but still, we got the outdoor sitting instead which was a not that great.Yes, we ordered Chilli Crab, Black Pepper Crab and got a Salted Egg Crab as the free one. My take on the crab dishes, about average and only the Black Pepper Crab was nice, in my humble opinion.The famous beef steak, was basically a grilled beef steak cut into cubes, grilled to your specification. Ours was medium well. When it was first served, hot and fresh from the grill, it was nice. It came with a small pot of claypot rice (basically, rice cooked in a claypot and served with some mixed sauces. The claypot rice was nice. Overall, the beef was nice but please eat it up when it is hot, otherwise, when it has cooled down, it doesn't taste great. The price of this dish was very expensive and I won't try it again.We also ordered the cereal prawns and a vegetable dish. These were average tasting.Overall, I find the food just slightly above average, despite its popularity, but the price we ordered for the dinner was on the higher end

Located deep inside the Sin Ming Industrial Estate neighboing to local garage workshops, it was not an intuitive location for a seafood restaurant. Indeed it took us and our other guests quite awhile to find it. We had 7 adults and 4 kids. Ordered the following:1. Their signature shovel nose ray: (need prior ordering) done 2 ways. Steamed and stewed in thick sauce with bitter melon. Interesting dish. Prefer the steam method since it's lighter on the palette. 4/52. Squid stir-fried with salted egg. This was quite diappointing. I think it would taste better if the squid is deep fried in batter before coated with salted egg sauce. Would be less soggy. 1/5 star3. Poached shrimps. The boss recommended us to cook te shrimps the simplest way, poaching. Sadly, the shrimps were not only dead, but also unfresh. Would be better to just fry with sambal. 0/5 star.4. 1/2 roasted chicken. Ordered this for the kids. Nothing extraordinary that you won't find from a normal chicken rice stall in a hawker centre. 3/5.5. Baby kailan stir-fried with garlic. Just nice. Not over-cooked. 4/56. US Angus Beef steak served with mustard and chilli sauces and potato wedges. The beef steak was done well. Nicely charred on the outside but juicy inside. The sauces were unnecessary. 5/5 7. Fried rice with fats from the Augus steak. Yummy but totally busted the cholesterol scale. 5/5With a few cups of lime juices and bowls of steamed rice, total bill was just ~ SGD 220. Totally reasonable for that quantity of food in SG, a place with rampant inflation nowadays. The business was extraordinary for a restaurant in such a secluded location. There were insufficient waitstaff. Took us a good 15 mins before we could get someone to take our orders. Serving time was ok. 15 mins before dishes to start arriving.CAUTION: reservation absolutely required.Would return to try their crab dishes next round

We were absolutely staggered to find this complete gem of a restaurant. We were taken by some friends as we had no knowledge of the place whatsover. What a great surprise it was.There is a superb blend of local and Western dishes - the off menu curry pie was incredible - and there is a great selection of wines and whiskies as well as a great understanding on corkage.Excellent service with very helpful staff also. We'll definitely be back

Definitely not what you expect, it is in the middle of an industrial estate, surrounded by car workshops. However, the food is worth a foodie's trek. Even though it says "seafood restaurant", it has excellent non-seafood options too, like the smoked duck and beef rib. The beef tallow is also used to make a very flavorful albeit potential artery-clogging fried rice! The squid rings coated with salted egg is the best I have tried. Not overcooked and chewy! Best of all, the owner Mr Pang is more than happy to allow you to BYO. And if he likes you enough, will even give you a little whisky from his own collection!

I am not a seafood fan. Yet I have gone to Ubin Seafood dozens of times and brought many friends and relatives there, who in turn, have gone many times with their family and friends.What's the secret?Excelllent food, seafood and non seafood at prices that keep you coming back for more.The boss Mr Pang has a variety of "gourmet foods" that will not be amiss in a high end restaurant. These gems include his signature Rib Eye Platter which is US ribe eye, done medium rare, with a generous side of potato wedges and crowned by the most sinfully delicious plate of beef-fat rendered fried rice. This is the dish that almost every table will be gorging on!Then he has a smoked duck appetiser that is in-house smoked. Also great pork knuckle and braised pork leg dishes that bring you quickly to cholesterol heaven.Seafood lovers will be well catered to with the barbequed dragon prawns, crabs, sotong dishes and steamed fish dishes.Definitely a must try if you are a foodie

A good friend said that pretty much everthing at this restaurant was good; except the fish. Go figure. But when my wife and I got there we were immediately attracted by the crispy pork leg, the brinjal special and the fish roe with chinchalok or fermented krill. That's as close as we got to seafood. The crispy pork leg was good and it came with a limey chilli sauce and another that had hits of pesto, basil, yogurt. The fat and skin go well with the former and the meaty bits with the latter. It took a while for the brinjal special to arrive but it was worth the wait. Deep fried brinjal sauces in a sauce made from, among other things, tamarind and honey and flavoured with curry leaves that were also deep friend. The last dish took an age to arrive and we had to ask the waitstaff to check on its progress. Just as we were about to give up, it showed up. Chunky pieces of fish roe, in a tamarind flavoured chinchalok sauce and with lots of petai, sometimes known as stink bean, a difficult to find bean of which I am very fond. The two dishes, the brinjal and the fish roe complemented each other well. For unknown reasons, our rice did not arrive but I would not have managed, It was a large pork leg and the serves were ample. At $30 a head, without drinks, this can hardly be classed as a cheap meal but it was excellent food at the price. I'm told the pork satay here is very good too. Next time

Beef and german pork knuckles are the two must-try dishes.

Nice local seafood and stir-fry dishes. Don't miss out their beef steaks! You'll need a car or cab to access the restaurant. Relaxed dress code...

Good place to go with a group. Looks pretty basic, tucked away on a backstreet opposite a row of workshops, but fantastic fresh food - try the crab, any way you like it! Good value and always busy. Very informal and laid-back.

A good place for informal dinner. Price is reasonable and owner Mr Pang is very accomodation. For those who drink, this is a perfect place. Black label anr wines are reasonably priced.

On 26th October 2012, we had dinner at this establishment which is hidden amongst the motor mechanical workshops at Block 27 Sin Ming Road. It is not our first time eating at this restaurant, but the food here deserves mention.The restaurant is run by Mr S M Pang and his wife Michelle together with Franky Seet.As it was a public holiday, the place was jammed packed as it is on weekends. Parking is available at the road side in front of the restaurant and at the HDB parking lots behind.We tried the following dishes:Satay. This was tender and succulent served with cut cucumber and onions. Delicious with either the usual peanut sauce or with cut chilies in black sauce. Next came the small deep-fried buns, with crispy skins and sweetish crumb. These were tasty and served as an appetizer.Smoked duck breast. The meat was soft and tender, very little fat except under the skin and deliciously smoky in flavor.Cold crab. The flesh was fresh and firm, sweet and tasted even better with the chili sauce.Fried rice with seafood. We found this a little too saltish and oily, but all the same, it was delicious, with the aroma of wok-fried rice, strips of fatty pork and of prawns and squib.Sambal Kang Kong fried with dried shrimps was crunchy and not too spicy hot. This was served in a generous serving of the sambal.Fried Egg plant with dried red chilies tasted sweet and with some sourness, and the skin of the egg plant was crunchy.Squid fried with salted egg yolk was nicely done, not too salty, was chewy amidst the sandy sensation and juicy. There was a generous amount of salted egg yolk covering each bite size squib.US Angus Ribeye Beef with roasted potatoes wedges (skin attached) and caramelized onions. Came on a carving wooden board with two sauces, a tomato based sauce and a peppery sauce. The meat was very tender with that ‘melt-in-your-mouth’ sensation. Not too well done or rare. Perfect! A most unexpected dish in a seafood establishment and even more surprising is that the dish is so well done.Crispy Pork knuckle. The meat was very tender falling apart easily, but unfortunately the rind this time was not crispy as we expected it to be.Fried noodles was delicious, probably because of the generous slices of fatty pork meat. Came fried with some prawns, squib and clams. Very flavorful with the strong wok taste!Fried rice with Beef droppings. Our last item is complimentary with the US beef dish.The rice was fried with the oil from the beef dish with bits of beef fat fried to a crisps providing some crunch, but the dish tasted flat this time. Some of us ate the rice with sambal sauce to enhance the taste. The dish has been dubbed by the establishment as the “heart attack fried rice,” and you cannot order this item without ordering the beef. All the dishes were like 'medium' size in portions, so you are able to savor more dishes.The alcoholic drinks are priced very reasonably and there’s no corkage if you BYO. The menu also includes the normal seafood fare of crabs and prawns done either with chili, garlic, pepper, salted egg, or just steamed. For a seafood restaurant, it’s surprising that the beef dish was so good. Certainly there are not many places in Singapore where you can enjoy a good Steak and Cze Char food! Definitely a place to recommend in spite of some inconsistency in food preparation. When it’s jammed packed with diners, the service can be quite slow. There’s an air conditioned room which is not lavish in decor which sits about 8 tables, and you cannot help but notice the cardboard egg cartons that pad the ceiling which helps dampen the noise from diners.Opening hours are from 11.30am to 2.30pm and 5.30pm to 10.30pm dail

When it comes to down-to-earth prices for the best seafood in singapore - it is here - new ubin seafood at sin ming. Atmosphere is as industrial as you can get but who cares when the food is really fresh and cooked the way it is supposed to be - authentic and singaporean. Go for the white pepper crab if you have to choose only one as it has a unique aroma and taste and of course the sizzling ribeye steak with the accompanying dark rice cooked in all the juices of the fat and drippings.. YUMMY! Pang also has a selection of good chilled wines but we always go for the ice cold Erdinger ; that and fried rice and salted fish is a staple we just keep coming back for more of

Who would think that one can get delectable Singaporean Seafood (crab, sting ray, salted fish fried rice) and a high end wine cellar (with glasses matching the varietal to boot) in an industrial estate full of auto repair shops? Well, Ubin Seafood is that place. The owner Pang is a former finance executive who clearly knows how to spoil his clientèle. You must try the BBQ steak and the accompanying fried rice

I offered to buy a friend of mine a dinner if he would drive. He suggested New Ubin which is owned by a former schoolmate. Despite the fact that my friend is a native Singaporean and has been here many times, he still had trouble finding it, partly because the GPS couldn't find it either. It is also surprising because it is across the street from a lot of car repair shops. But what a find. It is large by local standards with huge eating areas both inside and outside. There is also an air-conditioned dining room. The food was plentiful and delicious. Among other things, we had the ribeye steak which was great. (It is cut up so you can eat it with chopsticks.) We also had a nice bottle of wine which i would not ordinarily expect. This is another exemplary of Singapore's reputation as the best place in the world for food (except maybe San Sebastian)
4
A bit of a hike from the beaten path to find this place, but when you get there you get a sense of discovery. It is set in the industrial zone in what may have been a car repair shop earlier. Though this is supposed to be a seafood place, the meat is surprisingly good too (we tried the steak). Even if you are not big on rice, you MUST try their fired rice, which is fried in the fat from the meats cooked there (probably unhealthy, but oh-so yummy!). Try to get a table indoors, which is air-conditioned

Heard a lot of reviews about this restaurant esp the negatives about its overcrowding and service and the positives about its wok-hei and its ribeye steak so decided to drive to the heartlands to find out with 3 other good friends.We ordered the following;(1) the ribeye steak was very well done, soft, succulent and full of flavour (in fact better than some of the better steakhouses like Mortons),,and the beef lard was used to cook a free dish of beef fried rice (so - so as rice was moist whereas it should be crispy dry for fried rice). but the beef was yummy and definitely a signature.(2) the hokkien prawn mee was robust, prawny and the stock was so delicious,,,,in fact, we had a 2nd helping of the prawn mee as we gobbled down the first helping in record time,,,,if we have to order some carbo, then this prawn mee would triumph over the fried rice.(3) the hong kong kailan also had good wokhei, they chopped the leaves and fried with salted fish and the rest of the kailan stems were braised and then mixed together,,,,nice crunchy wholesome taste,,,,simple and nice,,,(4) the crispy eggplant had a sourish, sweetish taste to it. First impression was good and tasty abit like those indonesian spiced drink but got a bit overwhelmed by the 4th or 5th bite,,,but good for a first taste....(5) sambal petai,,,,the chef had taken the effort to remove the bitter bits and the petai was crunchy but the sambal was a bit lacking in fire,,,,(6) Dont try the coffee,,,obviously no one comes here to drink coffee so coffee here worse than 3 in 1,,,,,But come during lunch,,,,we sat in an aircon room and enjoyed good food and good service,,,weekends and dinners obviously can be a bit painful.All in, we paid 130 and considered this to be relatively good value as the steak and beef fried rice was only 58,,,,some consider expensive but i sonsider a steal vs Mortons and the Cut.(6
