The place is not big, the wines were great. The service was excellent. Different dishes to go with wine. Worth trying it and making your own minds. Would go back to if visiting Singapore again.

Never heard until one of our friends recommended the restaurant. Japanese owner was very friendly and on hand to introduce the dishes. Though not out of the world but food is fresh and good tasting. Prices are reasonable. Very cosy restaurant with limited seats.

It's definitely a great place for fine wine lovers, nicest glass of wine I have ever had. Lovely atmosphere. Beautiful cheese and chutney. Can't wait to go back!!

Had dinner tonight at Le Pin. The main man, Shige, is an engaging and generous host. My meal was excellent, Spanish with a Japanese twist, and the wine was a pleasure to drink. Needless to say, this being Singapore, the wine was not cheap, but the food was quite reasonable. The place is hard to find - at the back of the 2nd floor of Orchard Plaza, but well worth the effort. Will definitely tell all my friends in Singapore. Just hope it doesn't get too popular...

Don't be fooled by the exterior that looks quite dodgy to say the least. This small wine bar sells some of the finest wines and champagnes in the world. If you want a Latour or a Puligny Montrachet then come here. I was also pleasantly surprised about the prices. Cheaper than London

My friends introduced to me this particular wine bar and I was skeptical at 1st but am so glad that I went. The food sold was delicious esp salads and there are a variety of good vintage wines to pick from which are not costly. The boss is a japanese guy who's very friendly and serves very well
