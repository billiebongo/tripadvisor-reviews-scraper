Tried them for the first time this past Wed. Fab, friendly, fun staff with good service. We only had a few dishes (octopus ceviche, fried olives, pulled pork, crispy chilli con carne, & the chocolate-egg custard dessert), & they were ALL good. The dessert was so good we wanted to lick the bowl. Can't wait to go back to try the cocktails & more dishes.

Went with family over the weekend. Place is popular with locals and expats. Good food - small portions but reasonably priced. So if you are hungry, just order more. Food is tasty. Service is fast. Matt and Lorenza who served us are simply great with their recommendation and very pleasant / helpful service. It was a fairly busy weekend evening for them but they kept their broad and lovely smiles throughout. Restaurant generally has a happy crowd.Great place to catch up for drinks with friends

This is an absolutely brilliant new joint in Singapore. The food was great, the service was excellent and the ambiance was perfect. Definitely recommend visiting at least once! Just a little warning that it does get a little busy inside but you'd expect that from such a cool place

I don't often write reviews, but I must say that Casa Poncho is one of my new favourite places to go for drinks with friends. Despite being a relatively new establishment, they certainly know what it takes for people to have a good time here. The ambience at Casa Poncho is lively and hip, marked by the colourful decor and paintings on the wall. My choice of cocktail was the Marca Pina, and it was delightfully refreshing. It went very well with the Guacamole and Chips that my friend and I shared. The people here are all very friendly too! So if you are looking for a place to chill and hang out with friends over good drinks and music, Casa Poncho is a great choice for that and I would recommend

Stopped to Casa poncho with a group of friends as we were starting the night. The first impression was how charming and different it is.We ordered a couple of their Mezcal based cocktails ( Margarita mMezcal was delicious !!) and really liked the particularity of this liquor. Service was really nice and entertaining, everybody loved the vibe and music. Then we ordered some of their tapas sharing plates; Simply put all of their dish were amazing. I personally really enjoyed something that they call the 'burrito love affair' and the 'pulpo ranchero' ( grilled octopus!!). We were also told by the manager that they recently increased all of their portions so I guess we had luck!Truly an amazing night, thank you casa poncho

Food portion was tiny. Variety of dishes were limited. The recommended mexican wine smelt bad. Not comfortable ambience

Food was delicious but service was sub-par. The glass of house red I ordered smelt foul and when I asked for a different glass/drink, the waiter did not come back

Absolutely love this new, sexy Latino restaurant situated in the charming district of Bukit Pasoh, one of the few shophouses with a front terrace leading you through the bar, dining area and through to another back terrace. Owners have transformed what was once the Chinese mahjong association to a super hip, exotic and colourful space, full of soul, with its Mexican artefacts and vibrant murals. Tapas style dishes with a modern creative twist. Enjoyed the tuna ceviche, fried olives, chicken/beef burrito, pork tortilla and beef con carne, as well as the superb Mezcal cocktails. Perfect for parties and groups of friends. Lorena the Mexican manager and Chris the bartender were wonderful
