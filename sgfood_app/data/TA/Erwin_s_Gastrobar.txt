Food was tasty and service was efficient. Enjoy every time I eat here. A little noisy here but to be expected because it is a casual place to have a quick eal.

Overall, the bar has a pretty chill vibe and is a good hangout place for friends to catch up! Food was average, but ambience makes up for it!
5
Loving the food and service as always. Didn’t drink this time round but it’s really good for chilling after a day of work~
4
Nice place to chill and have after work drinks. Can be a bit pricey though! But the atmosphere is good and comfy
5
two of us went when the bar wasn't as crowded and service was excellent! though it was mainly just a one man show. chairs were abit dirty though... the cushion chairs with holes and alot of dirt stuck inside
4
Good food and service. Went for lunch and good value with entertainer one for one set. Will revisit agaub

I had waited for this place to open up on weekends so when they did, I tried it out. Had been to the outlet in Valley Point before and was expecting same in terms of ambiance and food.Unfortunately neither the ambience nor the food lived up to the other outlet. I imagine it is a better place during the week when the area is bustling

I returned for another lunch at Erwin's with a friend yesterday. Quite crowded at lunchtime, even on a Monday, but we were able to get a table inside at 12:15 still. We both opted for the beef burger which was quite tasty but took a while to arrive. Very noisy inside. The bill also took a long time to process, but the staff were friendly
2
1 hour and 50 minutes for a one course lunch says everything you need to know about the service and when the food did arrive it wasn't worth the wait. It seemed like the fish in the fish and chips was frozen. Beer was find and if I was to return it would be for drinks

We visited during lunch to celebrate a colleagues' birthday and ordered salad with salmon, agility olio with crab, chicken and tuna salad. For sides, we ordered fries. Unfortunately, we were not particularly impressed with the food. Standard was mediocre as the salmon in the salad did not taste fresh and had a rattler 'frozen' taste. As for the crab aglio olio, again, it tastes average and not exactly delicious. Fries did not impress us either. Again, the fries don't taste fresh. However service was good and they were attentive despite the lunch rush hour.
4
Food was good, especially love the fries. I was surprised by the lunch crowd though, quite packed. Overall, food service was still fast!
4
Service was really quick! The minestrone soup was also nice and comforting with lots of vegetables! Aglio Olio was nice with the crab meat too (:
3
Just bar food - nothing gastro about it. Came here for lunch for the third time. Liked the fish and chips but the steak was chewy and flavourless and the steak sandwich fared no better. Only come here due to lack of business lunch options.
4
Had the chicken parmigiana, loved the salad and fries. The chicken wasn't to my liking tho, but overall a wonderful atmosphere for me and my partner to chill at.
4
The food was good and the portions are reasonable. Pity the calamari didn't seem marinated enough. Service was good.
3
Ok for not too formal business lunch but need to shout can't talk as insure the restaurant has too much noise, everyone seems to be shouting...
Also service staff should be more attentive checking on diners requirement, to take orders etc...
3
Decent American good priced at a slight premium (possibly due to its location). Would look to try other options in the vicinity.

Erwinâ€™s is a great after-work hang out spot, with mostly office crowds. They have a very good small bites menu and high-quality German beer & Italian Prosecco.But no problem, if you come after a workout for some healthy food options. We absolutely love their tuna steak - great quality, good portion and nice greens.And what really comes handy, is their salad options - you just tailor it to your diet.The service is very friendly, quick and efficient
5
I come here to meet my friend who works nearby. With chope we always manage to reserve a table even tho the place it packed during lunch hour. I love the new menu. I had the raw salad with grilled chicken. It looks like a huge place but I managed to finish it cuz it was so yummy. Definitely coming back again
4
I was thinking of those draft beers would be straight out from those taps on the wall. Turns out, those are just wall decorations! Beautiful and looks very real. Food, services and ambient as met our expectations. In fact, the place turns out to be full and very lively once approaching 8pm. Perhaps it's one of the favorite places to go to afterwork. I'll still be continue to dream for a place where I can have draft beer from the wall of taps.

visited about 4 times for happy hour, birthdays, celebrations of all kinds and types with friends, ex n colleagues, .... good service from the friendly staffs. indoor cooling or outdoor environment overlooking the high sky scrappers
3
Food is not bad though abit overpriced for the portion. Service is generally not bad but lack service staff during lunch time.
4
Food is definitely great at Erwin, Service personnel are funny just that the serving of food is a little bit slow. Especially for Desserts which do not require cooking.
Overall the experience is good.
4
i had a seafood stew which was well seasoned and the seafood not overcooked as often the case with seafood stew.
2
If u are going for Happy Hour, this is a decent outlet... with reasonably priced beer and wine.. but avoid the food as they are largely disappointing... Service is another issue... may take a few attempts to remind them during busy hours...

Came here for lunch today with a friend and we both opted for the steak sandwich. Quite tasty and served fairly quickly. Freshly squeezed orange juice was also pretty good. Only real complaint was that it is just too noisy inside - we had to raise our voices to be heard above the din
2
Clearly not a place that most diners will think of for a decent meal. Every single food item we get to sample is edible, but forgettable.A good chill out place if you want to hang out for a quick drink. Service crew can be quite slow and forget orders at times. Not a place I will recommend unless you are in MBFC area and couldnt find seats elsewhere
4
We booked a table for 10 but there was limited seats when we arrived (thankfully only 6 of us came first, there's only 4 seats) Wait staff were courteous but told us they couldn't give us more chairs as there are big groups of 20 (although we booked early so no excuse) Overall food was relatively priced, would go back during non-peak hours.

This was the second visit for me in two weeks. For the first visit, we had ordered veal cheeks, fish and chips and chicken parmigiana. The second visit we ordered fish and chips and the Ribeye. Both times the food was great, the service excellent and ambience cosy.This place serves very good drinks as well. My usual is the Red Mojito. Really recommend this place for lunching or chillax after work (it's just outside my office building). They serve breakfast as well but I haven't tried it out yet.Will be back again

Good for casual lunch for people working around the area. Very popular for both locals and expats. Salad, burger, sandwiches, lasagna etc and good selection of drinks. Relatively large portion and very tasty. I had lunch here for 2 days in a row and enjoyed different dishes. The only disappointing thing was that I had to ask for the bill three times and it took more than 15 minutes to get the bill and pay.
4
the food is pretty much standard british grub but hen again, people come here for the drinks and vibes rather than food. and for that Erwin's pretty good. decently priced too.
3
Food was decent; nothing spectacular. Had to keep on getting the condiments by ourselves as there wasn't any supplied. Service was alright
3
Positives:
* Location, Location, Location... but poor service
* Perfect for Coffee catch-up
* Optimal for beer catch-up
Negatives:
* Service is not timely and not friendly
* Environment / tables not comfortable
2
We ordered a mushroom risotto. It was disappointingly tasteless. We asked for red wine and they had only a couple of options; more were listed on the menu. The wine we got was quite bad too
5
Dropped by this place using the Entertainer App. Had their ribeye beef steak and tuna. Both was equally good. Pretty pricey to done without any promotion or use of the Entertainer App. Great resturant ambience good for after work catch up with colleagues or friends. Will be back ^

This is an extremely popular place for colleagues to enjoy a pint or unwind over drinks, especially on a Friday night. They serve addictive finger food such as chicken wings and fries.But we would also recommend this place for lunch too, since they have a rather extensive menu.Tried one of their hearty specialties which is Chicken Parmigiana. This is crumbed chicken breast drenched in Napoletana sauce and mozzarella. It is well paired with fries and salad ($19).My colleagues had their New Zealand Mussels, served in a small metal bucket, and with some bread.They also serve weekly specials, which you can check from their table standee, or with their server.My colleague had their Vittoria coffee, which was aromaticService is efficient, fast and fairly friendly.Decor is cheery and laidback.Their indoor seating is a tad cramped and noisy, but one can opt to dine alfresco in their outdoors area instead, which is great at night.Recommend this popular place, in the area.HelenSingapor

Been to Irwins a few times for lunch. They serve a pretty decent chicken parmigiana...not as good as the ones I get in Melbourne but good enough. There's a good variety of beers on tap too. The only thing is it gets really noisy inside when crowded and you just can't hear what your friends are saying. And it's too hot to be sitting outside during lunch time. If the bar can do something to reduce the decibel levels, it would be a great place..
3
I have visitted this place with my friend quite a few times, the food taste is incosistent. We have ordered coffee together with our lunch meals, the coffee was served first before the food was seeved! It was cold, once we have finish our meals :
3
Working at MBFC, Erwins is often a default choice for a quick after work drink. But I feel they don't really try hard because of this fact. People will keep coming back despite average beer, food and service and pretty high prices. I'm going to try a few others for now
5
Regardless if you come for breakfast, lunch or dinner, Erwin's never disappoint me. t's very convenient that they open early for bf and offer freshly squeezed orange juice and great cappuccino.For lunch or dinner, I prefer their salads (you have many choices) and the quesadilla (best in Singapore). And this is one of the rare (only) places where you can order Aperol Spritz and Hugo. Overall a great, convenient place for good food and drinks
