I left a note on my Chope reservation to say that it was a birthday celebration for my husband but the restaurant didn't seem to take notice. Nonetheless, the service and food were great.
1
The wagyu didn’t even taste like a really good wagyu and the halibut was cooked to the pint of being a dried fish, the filet mignon was bad and overall the steaks were all hard and the halibut was very dry.

Steak is good in terms of flavour and texture...not surprising for the price they charge. Come here if u would like to be serve by pinoys wait staff who can be snobbish when you do not order enough. Lightings a little too dim.

I went with a friend on the 13th of Feb to celebrate my birthday after reading rave reviews about the steak here. We ordered: A bone-in ribeye, a lobster bisque, their signature jumbo lump crab cakes, parmesan truffle fries, stir fried mushroom and spinach, and a molten lava cake together with a glass of Malbec each.The Good: I noticed they printed a personalised menu for my birthday. The lobster bisque was nice. The crab cakes and fries were alright, and the "Morton's Legendary Hot Chocolate Cake" certainly lived up to its name. One of the best lava cakes I've had to date.The Bad: We ordered the Bone-In Ribeye done medium-rare to share, as we had been informed it was a rather huge portion. When the steak arrived, I prodded the centre of the steak with my knife and it felt soft and squishy. True enough it was blood red when I cut through - akin to a meat picked off the shelf of a supermarket. It took us a while to ascertain whether it was really uncooked or merely the restaurant's terribly lighting playing tricks on our eyes. I understand you're going for a romantic candle-lit atmosphere, but this is really too dim.The restaurant was not packed, but it took us quite a while to catch a waiter's attention (probably because it was so dark?). Your service staff was polite and he duely took the steak back to the kitchen to be redone. However, when it came back, the centre was still inedible. After the second attempt, I was so exasperated and the waiter suggested I just slice the remaining steak into chunks before it was sent back into the kitchen for the third time. It took THREE tries mind you, before it was even edible. Of course by then it went from undercooked to overcooked. Is it that difficult to take the effort to check for doneness of your steaks before sending it out? If your chefs have difficulty cooking the steak because of its thickness, please don't even offer it on the menu. I'd rather a thinner piece of steak that is done right the first time. I was incredulous. This is a steakhouse, not your neighbourhood kopitiam. I came here expecting some standard in your steaks, not just your sides. At the end of the meal, no one checked on us whether we found the food satisfactory. I guess having sent the steak back thrice already made the statement

The good thing about Morton's is the service offered to patrons.The wait staff play close attention to the diners and are often within earshot when needed.The steaks are good and so are their crabcakes! Their desserts are also worth it!Wish they would bring back the introductions of their various steaks during order taking though
5
If you are looking for a good Steak whilst in Singapore, Morton’s Steak House is worth. Visit. Truly great Sirloin Steaks with homemade Chips and an excellent choice of Wines
5
Went to celebrate a friend's birthday. They personalized the menu to wish happy birthday, and they went beyond normal service to make the experience special. The food is really good as well, definitely a recommendation for couples or close friends if you want to make a special occasion memorable
5
We usually order the filet mignon of varying sizes depending on how hungry we are and the Cajun spiced ribeye. For starters and sides, we like the crab cakes, spinach and French fries. Oh! Try not to fill up on the irresistible bread. Molten lava cake is beautiful but we are not fans of the soufflé. We have not been here for about a year because we bought a BBQ and the man of the house grills a mean steak! We are happy to “rediscover” Morton’s and will make it a point to dine here more often.
3
The porterhouse steaks and it was incredible and probably one of the best steaks in town.However could really be giving the other dishes including the soup and side dishes misses. Had only a mouthful of the spinach and made an enquiry with the waitress and feedback was “yes it was supposed to taste like this.”For desserts, without looking at the menu, we called for the soufflé and Molten cake as per the waiter recommendation, and he went ahead and ordered the soufflé for two portions without informing us (only two of us) there is a single portion option. Of course we could never finish them.
5
An electric storm came in and as we were staying at the Mandarin Oriental - and having had a friend recommend this restaurant highly - we decided to not venture out but see if we could get a 'walk-in' at Morton's - and goodness me, are we glad that we did.Service was 5-Star all the way - unobtrusive but perfectly attentive - staff explaining both food and drinks menu, impeccably professional and absolutely on the ball from start to finish.Semi-open-kitchen allows you to see the vast array of steaks coming out and the professional, fast, orderly way in which the kitchen worked.The oysters we had to start were fabulous - fresh, great texture and perfectly presented on ice.We both took Steak Mignon 6oz and 8oz and I have to say that this was one of the most tender, succulent steaks I have tasted in many, many years. The sauces were perfect, button mushrooms fabulous, 2 kinds of potato superb ..... you could not failt anything (not that we wanted to).Great wine/cocktails selection; superb quality food cooked precisely how we wanted it cooking and if you do one thing on your next visit to Singapore that you can REST ASSURED will not disappoint, then I would suggest Morton's at The Mandarin Oriental as first on your list - you will NOT be disappointed for sure.Thank you very much for one of the best dining experiences we have had for years

Way below expectation compared to other Morton‘s. Too expensive for what is offered. The service is ok.
5
I read some reviews about the drop in standard of service here, well for me it was stunning. Amazing details for my girlfriend's birthday. Cocktails, wine and food, all fantastic.
4
Nice place for groups/couple but is pricey.
Best steak and good seafood such as sea bass and lobster soup
5
The ambience is elegant yet inviting. The food was top quality yet affordable. Staff were attentive and friendly.
3
This was my fifth or sixth visit but the steaks were a bit off this time around - nevertheless still better than other steaks restaurants.
5
I've been at Morton's less than a week ago and I found it amazing!Inside of the Mandarin Oriental Hotel the atmosphere is very nice and the staff is amazing!The meat is outstanding and the size of everything is terribly huge! Don't order appetizers if you are having main course and side dishes! The staff was super because as we wanted to order more they suggested us not to because the size of every dish is really big, they were very kind!The pricing is not cheap, actually is quite expensive but it definitely worth it

I have to add the caveat that I went for lunch ( they are open for Sunday lunch & on special occasions like New Year's Day).The set lunch is 3 course (Sgd 65) and more if you choose certain dishes . The appetiser of the French onion soup was very good . However , what surprised me was that I had ordered a salad which was fine but no dining knife was provided for me to cut the salad slices which were large . I had to use the steak knife and this surprised me . We waited quite a while for our mains and I was on the verge of enquiring when I was informed by the manager that our server had placed the order but it had not gone through to the kitchen. However , I noticed the restaurant was not full & servers did not notice earlier .When the mains arrived , we ordered steak but steak dishes we have to pay extra (other options are salmon & chicken ), they were good .The last course was desert and again , if you opt for a certain desert , you have to pay extra. No extra is required for what I had which was key lime pie.I have been for dinner & service is better ; maybe the staff " coast " along a bit more for lunch . Still overall, not an unpleasant experience

We are styling in Mandarine oriental Singapore and my wife liked to have stake in top US Brand,They are offering special Wagyu US beef , so we want tor the best. But it was disappointing. As the meat was as soft as we know it.My guest order Fillet , he could not finish 1/4 of the steak, but the salads where excellent, and the onion bread. The staff where very friendly with great service
4
All 4 of us agreed the steaks and sides were very good but also noticed the quality of the serving staffs service capability, presentation, and attention to the small things that make a restaurant great were a Long way off what we had experienced previously at Mortons.Be careful Mortons you could lose position as there is lots of good competition.
5
Another experience at Mortons'. Great. Best service, good wine, beautiful meat. It's expensive but it worth. I eat ribeye as usual: terrific. Well cooked. The filet mignon is great, too. The waiter was so kind! He took us to the terrace to find a place to smoke. High level wine list
3
Happy hour with martinis and steak sandwiches. Book a table, have a few of the really tasty drinks and a few tasty steak sandwiches.
5
Food was awesome and staff was attentive and friendly. We will definitely be back. The Cajun steak was a bit on the dry side after the seasoning, but the bone in ribeye was fantastic.
5
Best steak in town. Ambience is very good! Service is excellent. Good for occassions/ celebrations :)
4
Went there to celebrate my wife's birthday in November. Food was great. we especially loved the warm bread, lobster bisque, crab cake and the USDA rib eye. Service was very good as well. They surprised us with a cake with a candle and a customized message wishing my wife a happy birthday. Will be back again

We moved from Hong Kong where we routinely dined 2-3 times a month at the Morton's in Kowloon. This is our first stop at the Morton's in Singapore and we doubt we'll ever be back. The service on comparison HK to Singapore is drastic: in HK we felt welcome and special every single time. Here we weren't even a number. Giving credit where it is due, the food is excellent. Their service staff, however, is lacking in the extreme from hostess to bartenders to waiters to busboys. It seems nobody cares about the customer.In my opinion, the management needs to radically re-educate their staff to understand that customers choose Morton's because it's supposed to be special. Otherwise, customers can go to Dan Ryan's or even Burger King. The prices at Morton's are exhorbitant: why pay them unless the experience is going to be fantabulous?Of the many examples of disappointing interactions that night, here's one that stands out. Cassandra called to confirm our reservations. She asked if there were something special being celebrated. When I said no, she said, oh well, then we'll see you tonight, leaving me to feel as though I was underappreciated before I even arrived
3
Morton’s has been an institution in Singapore for a long time so I was really looking forward to my repeat visit after several years. I must say I wasn’t blown away by the quality of the steak. Definitely had better at other places like Bedrock. Most disappointingly, Service was rather slow and it took a Long time to get anyone’s attention. The sides were lacklustre as well. Only thing that stood out was the soufflé. Don’t think I’ll be back again soon

Brought my wife to Morton's Steakhouse @ Mandarin Oriental to celebrate her birthday! Received a phone call to confirm my reservation. Was asked if I was celebrating anything and told them it is my wife's birthday! They then told me that that would prepare a personalised menu (2nd pic) and provide a complimentary dessert for her birthday! It is so nice of them!Upon arrival at the restaurant they wished my wife Happy Birthday once they know my reservation details. They have even prepared a nicely made photo holder/birthday card!Like many steakhouses, a loaf of bread is with butter at the side is served! The bread was really fragrant (it was onion fragrance I believe) and tasty! I would have finished the whole bread if I wasn't so full from the rest of the dishes.For drinks, we only ordered a Mocktail, Rosemary ($10) (we don't really fancy alcohol). It was a sweet drink that whets our appetite. For appetizers, we shared a serving of Maine Lobster Cocktail ($51). It was served Mayonnaise and Salsa on the side. The lobster was fresh and juicy. Based on the portion I see, it was probably from one lobster body or the claw.We also shared a portion of Lobster Bisque ($38). They portioned it out into 2 smaller bowls for us, so the picture that you see is not an accurate representation of the whole portion of soup. It was unlike any other lobster bisque that I have had before, it had that creamy taste but it wasn't that thick either and it didn't have that strong 'lobstery' taste that made it taste kind of fake. There were also some lobster chunks added into the soup. It is delicious!My wife had the 'Fillet of Fresh Salmon Topped with Jumbo Lump Crabmeat With 3 Grilled Shrimp & 2 Shrimp Alexander' ($110). People who loves seafood would definitely love this dish! The salmon tasted awesome and the shrimps were succulent and juicy! The crab tasted slightly more 'crabby' to our liking but it was fine

This is my first dining experience at Morton’s and it is for my boyfriend’s birthday dinner. The overall experience is brought to disappointment by the service quality provided by the staff. I’ve prearranged and communicated clearly before hand but on the real day itself, they screwed everything up. First of all, i booked for 3 pax but when i arrived, the staff told me they mistaken my booking was for 2 pax, hence he asked us to give them some time to fix. I was quite surprised when they said this, as I called them 3 times before the day to make sure all my instructions were noted. This was the first incident that start to make me wonder about their customer service.As a courtesy from the restaurant, for anyone who celebrate birthdays at Morton’s, they will take a photo and print it out as a small gift from the restaurant. So I specifically told them to only take the picture when the dessert is served, which is after our main course. The second incident was when the girl came to take picture for us before we order. I then had to remind/ tell her that i’ve pre-arranged the photo session to be taken last. Even when they took the picture at the end of night, they did not even let us view the picture first before they print out. She just walked away after taking and came back with the printout after 5 minutes. (Of course the photo doesnt look good)Third incident is, the stupid waiter that served us, funnily announced to the birthday boy (my bf) that because of his bday, he is entitled to a free cake, WHICH I ALSO SPECIFICALLY MENTIONED NOT TO LEAK A WORD ABOUT THE DESSERT!!! All the surprises seem ruined by the stupid staff, which is totally frustrating for me as i spent so much for a small surprise but the restaurant cannot even deliver!!!!!!!

We visited early evening during our trip in singapore. We have a baby with us and the staff were fantastic with him. It allowed us to relax and have the first meal out together as a family since he was born. Great food, lovely ambience and we loved the staff. Hopefully we will make it back
3
We ordered Cajun steak. Yes it's big portion, fills your stomach but I find quite a few fatty areas and Flavouring a little too salty for me. Apart from this, the steak is tastefully done.The lobster bisque is too salty that I had to change to something else. Customer service is excellent and beyond praises. This makes up for the lack of quality of food.
5
Looking for a quick early dinner. Meat being favoured , we narrowed to Morton the perennial favoured. Food was done to expectations !
3
Service is very good, very attentive and friendly. Food is very average. Music is very irritating. Not my type of place.
5
I love to come to Morton for steak dinner. I love the complimentary bread served while waiting for our order to come. Service very friendly and helpful. Nice ambiance too.
5
Great service and wonderful steaks. Only wish we had a Morton’s in London. Inside the Mandarin and also has a separate bar.
5
For extreme steak lovers only - the steaks are awesome, but expensive. Good thing is the portions for the steak are mostly shareable. We had the ribeye (medium) and it melted in our mouths. The complementary onion bread is awesome and the special souffle dessert (takes 25 mins to prep) is fluffy beyond imagination. We tried the crab cake as an appetizer and while it was delicious, 1 piece for 40 dollars was way too much for it. I would skip the appetizers next time and go straight for the steaks and maybe a side.Also a plus : the cocktails, they are good as well. Ambiance is shallow light (we went for dinner), so it suits all sorts of romantic and corporate events - people talk in hushed voice which is a relief.Revisit Likelihood : Definitely
5
Knocked it out the park again. Such a strong service team and buzzing ambience. They nailed the steaks and each side was outstanding. Ordered the Porterhouse and it was cooked to perfection. Beef Taco starter should not go a miss!! Thank you for a very accommodating evening from D. JONES and Friends!!
5
Tried the Double Porterhouse for Two that fed three. Meat was flavorfully aged and cooked to my liking – charred outside and juicy inside. Morton's Salad was good accompaniment. Was too full for dessert. Could only look enviously at dinner companions with better appetites who wolved their souffles and chocolate cakes...
5
My wife is a meat lover and the first thing that came to my mind for her birthday dinner was steak! And where better to get big, juicy and succulent steak than at Mortons. The service was impeccable. We were very touched that they gave my wife a signed birthday card and a customized Mortons menu that had my wife's name on it. Not only that, they gave my wife a free dessert. We ordered the 10 oz Wagyu Beef to share as we have also ordered the goat cheese salad (very nice! especially the caramelized walnut and sweet beetroot) and spinach with button mushroom sides. You will definitely walk out of Mortons full and satisfied
2
Service was good but food was below expectations for a supposingly renowned steakhouse at the Mandarin Oriental Hotel. I ordered a medium steak and it turned out almost well done, the replacement was closer to medium rare! I expect a steakhouse to master this basic a lot better

We just had dinner at Mortons, it was our 'special' treat restaurant for our honeymoon as it's an expensive place. We had both been dying for a great steak and tossed up between Mortons and trying Cut, but we absolutely love going to Mortons whenever we visit America and especially love the New York restaurant so decided to 'play it safe' and go there.Unfortunately we made the wrong choice. The Mortons in Singapore is a hollow shell of its American counterparts. The food is half as good, and twice the price. We spent $455 for two $25 glasses of wine, 1 crab cake, two eye fillets, cauliflower mash, and Brussel sprouts. In defense, the cauliflower mash which was a special was amazing. But when asked if we were celebrating anything special and we told them it was our honeymoon, they told us to 'leave room for dessert' only to not bring any dessert out. Something so foreign to the American Mortons as the last birthday my Partner celebrated there, they bought us out a dessert. Furthermore the bread that they brought out unannounced, then magically appeared on our bill.Overall if you are wanting a steak restaurant in Singapore, give Mortons a miss and save it for next time you are in America. It is a poor and expensive substitute for the real deal

A very good American steak house
May be the best in this part of the world
The food is exactly made to perfection
Laik in the USA
Exelent service
Hi prices
5
Awesome food and services! Bread was nice! Steak was superb! Gd customer service! Definite 2 thumbs up!
5
Had Honey-Chili Glazed Salmon Fillet for lunch. The fish is vibrantly colored with a speck of black pepper. It is served with chick peas, corn. The food pairs well together. Salmon is soft and tender.
4
Undeniably delicious steak, unforgettable onion bread and great service. The lighting can be further improved for a more enjoyable dining experience. It is just too dim to enjoy the meal to its fullest. Would have given it the maximum rating if not for the lighting.
4
the restaurant has a nice ambience. food was delicious. the service staff were very prompt and proactive.
4
Attended a lunch event at the venue. Food was great and fast. The ambiance is good. Compliments to Ms Avon for all the event arrangements.
5
Staff are all very attentive and professional. My server is Leo and he pays a lot of attention to our needs.Steak is great, many variety of wine choices. As I was celebrating my birthday, I have a special dessert too. Thumbs up for food and service
5
We went to Morton's to celebrate our wedding anniversary and we're not disappointed. Despite us arriving an hour ahead of our reservation time, the restaurant had a corner booth ready for us with personalized menus bearing our names. Food was excellent - bone-in ribeye medium rare with a lovely crust and a perfect pink centre, delicious crab cakes and yummy onion soup. Service was attentive without being intrusive. And to close off the wonderful evening, they surprised us with a huge lemon soufflé on the house
5
In the years that I have been at Mortons, they have consistently always delivered above standard food and service. While the menu may look pricey, the quality as well as quantity is definitely satisfying and you would not feel as if you're getting ripped off. While some of the service staff simply served (nothing to complain nor rave about), there are a few of the Mortons staff who went beyond, making small gestures to make your meal even more pleasurable and such gestures don't go unnoticed.

We used to dine regularly at this restaurant in the past and decided to return for a visit on a Friday night after some time away from Singapore but it proved to be a bad decision. Food was great but spirits were dampened with the constant camera flashes that kept going off at 2 tables next to us. While we understand that the patrons were trying to capture those beautiful memories but the comfort of the other patrons shdnt be neglected at all.A manager came by during the main course to check if everything was well but promptly walked away when I mentioned about the continuous flashlights that were going off that was causing discomfort. I guess he wasn’t prepared in dealing with anything other than positive feedback.At the end of the meal, we gave the same feedback to the ladies who greeted us on the way out. Unfortunately, they took the chance to leave while one of them tried to assure us that she will take the feedback to the management. At this point, it really seemed that no one in this restaurant seems keen to take any feedback. To be honest, it seems that some of your patrons found the lighting at ur establishment too dim and were fishing out their phones so that they can use their flashlight to read the menu. On top of that, those who wanted to capture beautiful memories were using their flashlight like crazy too. Dear Mortons, pls turn up the light cos clearly, ur patrons aren’t appreciating the lighting at all. If u decide to leave the lighting as it is then may I humbly suggest that you remind ur patrons to refrain from using the flashlight. Even the Night safari discourages visitors from using the flashlight when taking pictures
5
It was our first time at Morton's and given the opportunity we would definitely visit again. The steaks were exquisite, drinks delightful, staff excellent, and the dessert - their famous molten chocolate cake was to die for!
5
Was there for a birthday celebration. Understood that the dresscode was suppose to be smart casual, but the staff made an exception for us, knowing that it was for a special occasion. Really appreciate that. We were even offered with a special birthday menu arranged prior to our arrival and even helped us to take a group photo. On top of that, they even developed the photo and made it into a birthday card! Very surprised by the service. Much detailed attention was given to us, from ensuring our glasses are sufficient with water to folding our napkin even when we stepped away to the restroom for a short moment. The staffs in Morton's are definitely the true assets! Kudos to all the staffs!
4
When it comes to ordering meat, you can't go wrong at this place. Been here twice and the service was a lot better the second time compared to when I went in 2016. Although I have to admit, the price point doesn't justify what you get in return in terms of service and maybe presentation. It's pretty straightforward, you get a piece of good meat, that's all. All in all, the ambiance of the place and feel is quite good
4
I booked the restaurant for my husband as he is really into steak. The restaurant is all good, including the ambiance, food (even for me who doesn't really eat beef), and wine. The service is good but not too great compare to fine dining. The restaurant should find a way to let customers view the menu under such dimmed lighting
3
Overall quality was as the same as ever, good quality.Service let down as it seemed like dining at the best restaurant with hawker center service. Service was without care or with professionalism. was embarrassed to take my guest there, and with good quality of food, execution was done poorly, two of steak was mixed up and was not cooked properly
5
Meat and wine lovers - like myself - will find it hard to avoid Mortons. What you'll find in their Singapore branch, though, is more than you can expect from your typical Mortons experience. The chefs here just know their stuff! It is meat, cooked and served at its best - using the word "perfect" is cheesy, but it's deserved. I'll be here anytime I visit Singapore. Thanks guys - keep it up
3
The only meal out I have had in Singapore where I felt totally ripped off. A starter to share, steak each for main, and a desert was over $600SKD. Without wine!The food was ok, but not amazing, and certainly not worth the money. If the meal was brilliant and the service to match, then I would be happy to pay, but it wasn't. We will not go here again
1
I have travelled around Asia on business for over 10 years, and also living in Sydney, i am used to paying very high prices for dining out. However I was absolutely appalled at the prices of a steak when I opened the menu and i wish I had taken my wife's advice and left straight away. To be charged SG$125 for the smallest version of a NY steak and SG$100 for a 6oz Fillet without sides was daylight robbery. The steaks were not rested at all after cooking, so blood was oozing out of each cut of meat while we ate themI do know that wine is very expensive in Asia, but the bottle of Australian Red i choose at $150 a bottle is only $20 in Australia and maximum $45 in a restaurant.The service was mediocre and the side of brussel sprouts was cold and uncooked so had to be sent back, which did allow our steaks to rest, albeit in an ever increasing pool of blood.I certainly felt completely ripped off, and very dissatisfied with the entire dining experience, that even after a week after visiting I still feel very angry about it.Do not waste your money here as there are plenty of better steak restaurants in Singapore at half the price
5
As it was a meal to celebrate my hubby's birthday, I called the restaurant to inform them that it was a special dinner and if they could prepare something a little special it would be great - and they did. When we arrived at the restaurant, the staff wished him a happy birthday. The print out menu was sort of customized with a happy birthday message and there was a nice little decor piece on the table. A photo was taken and given to us to keep, and dessert was complimentary. Service was awesome throughout and the ambience romantic. Food was great, the husband enjoyed it a lot and said that Morton's would be his new go-to place whenever he craves for a good steak! Would definitely recommend this place and will come back again in the future
4
The low lit interior at Mortons provides an ideal setting for some good steak and wine. The freshly baked bread was great to dig into whilst sipping our red wine. The cellar had a small but good selection of wines.The steaks were very good cuts and preparation was perfect. The sides were also very good. The Brussels sprouts in particular really hit the spot.The vanilla soufflé and the freshly brewed coffee were just a perfect way to end a great evening. Would definitely go again
5
Service, food and atmosphere was impeccable. Enjoyed a complimentary soufflé as we were celebrating a birthday!
5
They give you a nice photo in a frame
And a customized menu to take home as a souvenir. Their food is delicious. You have to trey tho lemon drop martinis, yummy!!
4
Excellent meat perfect to enjoy a good steak with truffle fries. the dessert (soufflé grand marnier) was good also. the atmosphere is quiet in this restaurant located in the hotel but no view. We have enjoyed our diner.
5
The Steak is fantastic and awesome. Quality food in a romantic setting. Service was excellent and really commendable. The dining experience was more than pleasant. Definitely back for more.
4
Not my first time here but still as great as I remembered. Celebrated my father's birthday and the staff called in advance to note his name just so they could print it on the menu! Such a lovely gesture - we settled for just 'Dad' of course.. the mains are pretty good - had the ribeye and salmon to go with the salad and spinach with mushrooms. Wine was decent, normal priced for a hotel, as with the hard liquor. We had a lovely lemon soufflé on the house along with the bday cake we bought (weird that they didn't put all the candles though so my dad was only 60 lol!). Overall great experience thank you and we'll definitely be back for the prawns we eye-feasted from the kitchen!
5
We wanted to try this chain famous steak house, so we arrange and made reservation during our vacation trip in singapore. The experience was really nice, up to our expectation in mind. Decoration of the restaurant is really luxury, resembling a great night for fine dining experience. Staff are very friendly, had a good wine, and steak of course are great, coupled with their excellent tasted peppercorn sauc
4
The good thing: a mortons steakhouse in singapore looks similar to the one im stamford or florida and the meat is of the same high quality.As a steak lover you cant go wrong with mortons. Also side dishes like mac&cheese or cream spinach are highly recommended.On the other side you need to love the slightly darky rooms and the wine card which does not give you much of a choice than to ordering a bottle of red wine for over 100 Dollars. Even for me as a Swiss, thats quite a price for a standard bottle of red.But overall, quite a solid dinner. Would always return for a nice steak
5
Me and my sister visited in 2012,2015 and already planned to visit Morton's again! We love steak and been to many different fancy restaurants and we both picked Morton's our favorite place! Food was awesome and the service was also friendly and sweet!!!Sorry I forgot your name T.T Looking forward to visit there again in October :
4
I visited Morton's in 2013. I returned in 2016. Best fillet I have ever had and the ceasar salad sets the standard. Bread is amazing. The only hiccup was the server who was either confused or rude, or perhaps a bit of both. But the food made up for it
3
I've eaten here twice now, both times at the bar. Maybe its because the bar is away from the main kitchen but both times the food was somewhat cold by the time it reached my table.The steak is OK but for $100+ it should be really something special and it just isn't. Mortons definitely delivers with a certain style but the food and service don't come up to the price.
5
Best fillet mignon I have had in years. Great staff. Side dishes are for two , they are huge. Had cheesecake , lovely , and large portion. Would recommend this restuarant.
3
I tried to go once but failed my expectations. Not that good steak and not attentive service. Will not come back again
4
The martinis were very decent. Great place to catch up with friends on a Friday night! Would definitely go again!
5
Service, quality of food, ambience was impeccable. Service staff were detailed and very attentive to our needs.
5
Wife brought me here for my birthday. Food was great, service was very personalized (Birthday card/photo, FREE birthday dessert) and friendly. Portion is BIG for Asians and I would recommend sharing for those dining in groups. Not the cheapest by any means but worth every dollar for those special occasion. Will come back, thumbs up
4
When we arrived, we were told that our reservation was cancelled. I informed the receptionist that I made the reservation personally and I did not cancel it. On the contrary, I actually confirmed my reservation over the phone about 2-3 days prior. However, the receptionist and another team member insisted that someone had called to cancel the reservation. We were offered the alternative of still keeping our room but we had to vacate in less than two hours. Considering that this error was no fault of ours, we found this treatment right at the beginning of our evening to be a rather unpleasant one. Furthermore, since we were there to celebrate my wife's birthday, she was less than pleased by this oversight and the response from the staff. We had expected much better service.That said, the food we had was absolutely fantastic. The lobster bisque, wagyu filet mignon (a special dish) and bone-in ribeye deserve special mention. The chocolate lave cake was awesome too

Was at Morton's last night.The meal started off well. We enjoyed the ahi tuna tower and the prosciutto wrapped mozzarella.The mains and dessert were a disappointment. We ordered two lobster tails and a centre cut rib eye, medium rare (the latter at the recommendation of the Maître D' for its marbling).The steak came fully cooked, the lobster tail was dry and the souffle was soggy. Manager Edwin was kind enough to offerus another steak but that was hardly better than the first. Against our wishes he took the initiative to waive costs for the steaks and the souffle (we hadn't even given feedback on the souffle as we didn't want to overburden the poor man).To summarise, we wouldn't come back at the current pricing unless the standards are improved

I have been to this outlet of Mortons on numerous occasions and have always received impeccable service and fantastic food. Yesterday six of us took dinner at Mortons and all were pleased with the fine dining experience. I arrived before my guests and I sat st the table and enjoyed a whisky sour, then another - excellent!! My guests arrived and we were set for dinner. I chose the hot seafood selection for starter and the bone in ribeye for mains - medium well which was cooked to perfection. Nice selection of vegetables. Closes a little earlier on Sundays so last orders at 8.45pm. Not cheap, but then again fine dining with quaintly food in Singapore is always expensive. However, we were delighted with the dinner and the chatty friendly service from the staff. Nothing was too much for them. I would say good value for money - the steak was excellent and I could not have wanted better. Potions were large and we shared three vegetable dishes and three baked potatoes in addition to our meat selection. Great ambiance, good air conditioning, and excellent wifi. One of Singapores finest restaurants, and my first choice for steak.

Great steaks (especially the fillet mignon and chocolate mousse) as usual but service can be improved for a $400 meal for

Cannot recommend this place. At these, frankly stratospheric prices, I expect a lot more than a good steak.The service was abysmal, we seemed to have two waitresses who cyclically asked the same questions 30 seconds apart. Then at the next table an uncouth scruff in shorts decided to sit alongside his partner, facing us and kiss and cuddle. Very rude and annoyingly invasive as our main courses just arrived.Instead of managing the situation in a considerate way, the staff fussed around him and rearranged their table so that both were sitting square facing us. Totally unacceptable. They say you should complain there and then, but on this occasion it would not have been possible without causing a scene, besides which, I was livid at the actions of the table staff so would have struggled to contain myself.Anyway, we paid up and left. On the way out the hostess said "Hope you enjoy your dinner" without even looking up from her computer screen.All the elements of a lazy established restaurant which doesn't have to work too hard to meet targets. Delivers nothing memorable in the food stakes and nothing that bears remembering in terms of a service experience. Twenty eight SG$ for a tomato salad is fairly memorable though.First time I've left a restaurant actually angry

Excellen as always, had been eating at Morton's for over 20 years all over many contries like Atlanta, San Francisco, Hong Kong apart from Singapore.
5
It was good, staff were friendly and explained in details on the menu. Were helpful. I'm happy with the photo and customised menu. It was memorable.
5
We have come here several times for our birthday and anniversaries and Morton's never fails us each time. Food quality is excellent and the staff is polite, friendly and attentive.
5
The steak had a good marble and cooked perfectly. Portions were big. Desserts were good too.
Service was great.

Went there twice last year, and was impressed. This time nothing impressed, all very average, yet at the Morton price...
4
Always my favourite restaurant. Staff is attentive to your needs. Food is good. An enjoyable place to dine in.
4
It was a nice personal touch to deco, specialised menu with birthday girl's name and photo at the end of the event to create memories. With this personal touch you have won over patrons for special occasions.Maintain the service & the good food else you may lose out to a few good competitors out there.

Its sad when the food standard drops and the taste has changed. When Hortons opened its doors in the 90’s, its Porterhouse steak was the best USDA beef and be best steak in town! Even the onion loaf has shrunk in size. Originally Hortons never had a menu, they wheeled out choice cuts of beef on a silver tray as get the guest to select what they wanted. Only the service and ambiance was good
3
We had a function in a private room which was rather stuffy and warm. The service was good and personal. However the food did not live up to expectations. I had the 6 oz filet mignon. The beef was good but nothing spectacular. The sides and the soup are ordinary. The dessert was also ordinary. Perhaps I expected much because of the reputation.
5
Celebrated my birthday at Morton's. Staff has very thoughtfully customised the menu with my name and birthdate, table was decorated with birthday signs and all the staff came to wish me happy birthday. I think it's really sweet and thoughtful of the staff to even take a picture and have it printed. Thank you so much for the wonderful memory! :-)Food was excellent - the perfect medium-rare cut.
4
This time around my dining experience is much more pleasant with much lesser noise. The crowd is thinner and makes for a quiet dinner.
4
Quite pricey and the quality varies a little between visits but overall still a very good steak house for the meat lover.
5
Went for dinner at this amazing restaurant.Amazing steak and other dishes.Great service and friendly staff.a great experience and highly recommended.
5
Fixed this up months ago when we found there was a Morton's in Singapore.
Once again we were delighted at the quality of the service and the excellence of the food.
The steak was exquisite as was my wife's surf and turf mixed grille.

We had an excellent dining experience at Morton's the other night for a get together with friends. As to be expected the cuisine is very much American style fine dining, and the food choices as well as the dishes served did not disappoint. We especially enjoyed the lobster bisque and fresh salad with burrata cheese for the appetizers as well as the Wagyu Filet Mignon and Jumbo Crab Cake with grilled shrimp and scallops for the mains. The side dishes we chose were the creamy spinach, grilled green asparagus and the bacon mac & cheese. We loved the spinach and asparagus with a "vengeance", but the mac & cheese was a bit too "cheesy" for our tastes (and we actually enjoy cheese a lot). This was the only dish we didn't enjoy tremendously, and it really was more of a question of personal tastes - if you love your mac & cheese with loads of cheese, this is for you. We will simply choose another side dish next time, and overall were very impressed with the food offered at Morton's. The meat and fish dishes were fresh, tasty and extremely well prepared. The presentation was beautiful and not overly complicated, and the portion sizes were very generous. We did not have wine with our dinner, but the wine and cocktail selection is very varied and extensive - you will certainly find the right wine or spirits to accompany your meal. I personally enjoyed the atmosphere at Morton's very much since it is cozy and relaxing without being overly stiff - yet the whole place still has a very elegant "early to mid 20th century feel" to it. The only area of improvement was the service - even though our waitress was very friendly she did clearly lack deeper knowledge of the menu choices and was not as attentive as we expected her to be. Morton's is a fine dining establishment with prices to match, and at this level I do expect service staff to anticipate the needs of guests when it comes to basics (like missing cutlery etc). A bit more attention to detail and customer focus would have made our experience perfect. Finally, be warned about the directional signage within the Mandarin Oriental hotel intended to help you find the entrance to Morton's. We actually were directed in all the wrong directions by it, and spend a good 5- minutes trying to locate the restaurant entrance. Just go to Melt Cafe first, then turn right and you will find Morton's - there is no way to spot the restaurant from the elevators since the entrance is completely obstructed from view up until the very last

We made a reservation through Chope and indicated that we are celebrating our 10th wedding anniversary.When we arrived at Morton's, we were pleasantly surprised by the specially printed menu with well wishes to us on it. They proceed to take a photo of us, printed and placed into a simple card signed off by all the staff.We started with the Bread which has a crunchy crust and soft bread on inside, followed by appetizer, a rich and savory Lobster bisque.I had the fillet mignon 12oz (medium rare), soft and melty to my liking. Hubby had the rib eye 16oz (medium rare) which he preferred as he described it - there's texture bite and it is what rib eye should be like. Due to my cravings, I ordered the Parmesan/truffle fries which was a bad choice I made as the steak was filling enough. (If your partner is a small eater, I would say a 16oz to share would be sufficient).Morton gave us a complimentary dessert, the Lemon Souffle which was soft and airy, perfect to end the night with.Good dining ambience, servers were friendly, approachable and gave recommendation professionally. Additional note: We saw families, friends and couples at Morton's without noise disruption. Everyone was just enjoying each other's company. There are private dining area if you have concerns
5
Ok les be clear- this is not a cheap place to eat. 2 aperitifs, two glasses of wine, two (smallest) steaks, one bottle of water and one shared desert came to $440.What to do get is the best steak I've had anywhere in the world as well as easily the best customer service experience in Singapore (admittedly this is a low bar, but it's as good here as any three starred restaurant I've been to).Furthermore it appears to be the only restaurant in Singapore that has a sensible control on temperature and air conditioning.I cannot recommend this place more for a special occasion. We will be back
3
Beef was done well. Consistent with ala carte menu. Bread which was always good, tasted a tad stale. 3 course menu in promotional email was said to cost s$65 excluding taxes however when we got to the restaurant we realised that almost all on the items on the set menu carried an additional charge to it. In the end we paid s$80/pax for the main entree alone with additional charge for the appetiser.
5
Before I start the actual review I want to make sure to tell you to leave room for dessert. You'll thank me later. This is a place I would go for a special occasion. A very good wine list as well as selection of cocktails. I couldn't decide between beef or seafood so I went with the mixed grill. Glad I did. Impressive list of starters, try the crab cakes. Nice plate presentation on everything. Dessert exceeded my expectations and my ability to finish it all. :-
5
We opted for the $65++ 3-course lunch set, and topped up $35++ for a 16oz prime rib steak. The steak was so huge!!! It was absolutely delicious. In fact every course was delicious. Do also try the molten lava cake if you visit. Morton's has the best lava cake I've ever tasted. Absolutely amazing lunch here!!!
5
As usual, service was great & attentive. We had a wonderful evening. For 3 of us, we ordered a Porterhouse steak, a baked ocean platter & 2 side dishes. That was more than enough for us.
5
... you must eat a steak here. It's worth every cent. Made better by the service and friendliness. Everyone at the table enjoyed it very much!
4
The steaks are outstanding but just so ridiculously expensive, even for Singapore standards. Plan on spending about $200 per person. If it weren't so expensive I would give it 5 stars.
4
Service staff was attentive & friendly. The doneness of steak was on point. Definitely a great experience to celebrate an occasion!
5
The steak is juicy and delicious however I wish the plate stays hot longer.. The ambience is chic. A little bit too dark to read the menu.
5
Our host, Noor was fantastic and his recommendations were spot on. He was able to anticipate our needs and delighted us with excellent service even before we asked.
Morton's also customised our menu as it was our wedding anniversary.
5
Food is nice & well recommended by the staffs. Nice ambience but was abit dim on the lighting.
Recommended for steak lovers!
For non-steak eater, there are other nice food too.
5
If you want to feel really full you should eat the 5 peppercorn rubbed ny strip steak because it 500+ grams but it's quite spicy because of the peppercorns, the honey balsamic salmon is quite good too and you should try the legendary hot chocolate cak
5
Even by the lofty service standards one expect from Morton's,Singapore , and Mandarin Oriental, tonight was an exceptional service. Morton's has become one of my favourite steakhouse in Singapore for several reasons.The most important of which is the food and service are excellent and always impress me. When we were seated ,we were greeted by the Captain,John,who by the way is an outstanding Individual who is dedicated to service and it shows. He continuously checked on us to make sure our dining experience was everything we envisioned. He exceeded at every level. Truly one of the best dining experiences we have ever had. Highly recommend to anyone who really appreciates a truly personal fine dining experience.
4
The restaurant is within the Mandarin Oriental.As I had been to the restaurant 18 months and had a bad experience with the food as my rib-eye was simply bad (probably just out from the freezer), a friend convinced me to go back.This time, the filet was perfect both taste and cooking.Unfortunately the side dishes are not paying homage to the quality of the meat and a lot of improvement could be made on that side. For the meat lovers, you shouldn't be disappointed and I would go for the fries to make it a safe bet when it comes to the side dishes. I haven't tried the seafood side so cannot comment.As mentioned by others, it is a bit on the dark side when it comes to the lighting but I think it is just fine.It is also on the expensive side as a meal for 2 cost me 380SGD with a glass of wine each. So you have been warned !Bon Appetit
5
My first visit but I'll be back again. G&T was served quickly allowing me to pursue the menu comfortably. New York strip was perfect
5
Mortons Steak House is definitely the definition of fine dining in Singapore. The service staff would try and cater for your every need. The steak were done to perfection. Portions are big in here, which also match the price.
The dinner could not be faulted
3
We went there with a group and we had a set menu but the overall setup was not that nice amd steak was average
5
Dinner at Mortons was excellent. Great service and a great steak. Not the cheapest place to eat but great for a special occasion.
5
Came here visiting a friend - they do great happy hour cocktails 5-7 whilst also bringing round steak sandwiches for everyone from the restaurant next door. Situated in the Mandarin Oriental which is a gorgeous hotel.
5
One of my all time fave steak houses, Morton's guarantees a fabulous meal every single time! Our faves include the Centre Cut Filet Mignon, Centre Cut Prime Ribeye, Bone in Ribeye... my advice, go several times and try them all. They are cooked so well and medium rare is truly melt in your mouth perfect!Last night, they also had a special which was prime steak tartare... again truly wonderful, every nite was fresh and flavourful!Another must do, try all their 'Mortinis' my faves include the lycheetini, appletini, expressotini and chocolatini... supper yummy and addictive. You cannot stop at one!Happy hour 5 to 7 pm everyday at Morton's Bar, a good selection of 'Mortinis' with free steak finger sandwiches... excellent!Don't forgot to make reservations at least 3 days in advance.

We have mixed feelings about our dining experience at Morton’s steakhouse in Singapore.The restaurant is really too dark. I understand dimmed lights are cosy, but this is a bridge too far.Nothing to say about the menu and wine list, apart from the fact it is very expensive.We used our I-phone light to read the menu and wine list, but of course we could not use that during our dinerI hate when I do not see what I eat…..Are we not generally saying that we eat with our eyes?Noting to say about the food, that was as expected
5
Fairly occupied even on a Monday. Suggest to call and book before hand. Even though price is on the high side, it is worth it. Ordered lamb chops and they were so well done that stayed tender even after a long night of slow dining. Excellent, will recommend
5
A not too big and cosy place I found. Had a close encounter with a perfect big steak and just a salad, accompanied by beer. Just loved it. A great experience after weeks with mainly Asian food.A place with a cosy atmosphere and very friendly, perfectly serving staff.Worth to come back here

Mortons has a name for being the best of the best steak house in Singapore. It also has a reputation for being ruinously expensive. Honestly the expensive part is accurate, and best, well maybe. However it not good value, and frankly you might have just as good a meal for half the price elsewhere.We (a group of eight) had one of the private rooms, and kicked off with shared seafood platters for an appetiser. This turns out to be first class with superb lobster prawns and oysters. Very good start! Then the main course, which is things went slightly off the rails. The steaks are mostly enormous, but the waitress suggested we could have 10 oz Wagyu rib-eyes instead of the massive 14 oz slabs of cow on the menu. Three of us chose this option and two of us asked medium rare. But when the waiter served our steaks they were definitely not rib-eye, and not Wagyu. What we were served was overcooked filet mignon. At this price (over $100 per steak with out any sides) this sort of thing is outrageously unacceptable. Don't get me wrong this was a very nice steak, but NOT what we ordered. Sides are very pricey, typically S$25 to S$30 each. That for example means S$25 or S$30 for a (nice) plate of fries or mashed potato. We challenged the waitress about the "wrong steak" issue and she brought the manager. Since our bill was probably well north of S$3000 including drinks he agreed to give us two of the three wrong steaks for free, but really they could afford to. If you were here on your own (say as a couple) you might not find them as accommodating.Wines were excellent, but very expensive.Deserts also expensive. S$25 for a chocolate mousse!!!! (We shared one between three of us). It was a nice chocolate mousse, but S$25? Really???My advice would be give this place a miss unless you're really rich, and have a huge appetite, or somebody else is paying. There's much better value elsewhere. Sorry Mortons, I really wanted to give you a rave review. The food and wine really is good, but it's just not out of this World fabulous enough to justify your prices.We were there on a Saturday night from 7pm to after 11pm. It was far from busy. I think that says it all.
4
Courteous waitress, love her recommendation for steak. Steak serving was huge we split 1 steak into 2 plates. Got a complimentary soufflés for birthday. Total spending was appx $300 for 2.
3
Had dinner there and could not get a table till 9.30pm as resident of the hotel. A single course took 1 hour to arrive cold. Not impressed.
5
As always service is outstanding, food is great and for me is the best steakhouse in Singapore without paying $150 for Wagyu top cuts and still a proper size.
4
Good on special occasions where you want to get quality food, albeit the premium pricing. They help to celebrate your special day, be it anniversary or birthday. That itself is a good value already!
4
love their ocean platter and filet mignon. their chocolate cake is another must order. happy with the dinner :)
4
As usual a nice table decor. Courtesy of the house a free dessert.
Steak was excellent and fish/noodle dishes likewise.
Mortons is not cheap but they dont fail on delivery.
Except for the onion bread was overbaled and dry.
Never mind, I'll go there again
4
Team was attentive and offer good recommendation. Was my husband's birthday and the table and menu was personalised with his name.
Food was great as well!
1
Absolutely terrible. My wife's meal was inedible and my fillet was not recognizable as a fillet. What a disappointment! THIS WAS TO HAVE BEEN A SPECIAL NEW YEARS EVE DINNER, BUT WAS ANYTHING BUT SPECIAL. I've eaten a Mortons a number of times in other cities and they were good. Not so in this instance, even though very expensive
5
Second time here and the steak is also awesome! The deserts are very nice too. But I realize their wine price has gone up a lot, the wine I had 8 months ago has double the price now! The salad dressing are too thick, too. So the point is, eat their steaks because they are simply awesome
5
We were in for an anniversary surprise. There was a customised menu printed at the table, a complimentary dessert and they also took a photo and printed a photo card to make it memorable. We ordered Ginger paw and Pineapple Mojito which were interesting cocktails to kick off the evening.Then came the Lobster Bisque and five onion baked soup and both of them were great. For the mains we settled for Wagyu Steak- medium rare, Chicken Christopher and Jumbo Crab cake.All dishes were made to perfection. We finished off with the complimentary Gran Marnier Souffle which was fluffy with a nice orange flavour. A wonderful evening and full marks to their staff for their attentiveness and great service. Will visit again
4
Nice ambience and accommodating staff, who made our first experience a pleasant one. Wine sommelier also provided excellent tip for our pallet. This restuarant serves USA beef, we ordered 3kinds of Main for sharing but I like especially their Waygu Beef.
4
Overall the food and service were excellence. However the music was not so appropriate for the setting.
5
Overall, the service was exceptional and the steak was nicely done. The menu with my Wife's name, complimentary birthday dessert and the photograph really makes our day. The only feedback is the lighting is little dim to read the menu properly.
2
Not what I had expected of a reputable steakhouse... very noisy...not a pleasant ambience to dine, wine and carry on a conversation. Definitely not for couples on date...go somewhere else or you would lose your girlfriend. Quality of food also not up to expectation. Ruth Chris Steakhouse much better bet if you want a sreak meal
4
Service was attentive enough without being overly irritating. Glad you scrapped the beginning intro and let the diners directly choose from the menu. The lobster bisque could have had more lobster meat, and perhaps soup poured over it to show more pomp? The 8-ounce filet mignon done to my liking (medium) was excellent. The sides (creamed spinach & brussel sprouts) were excellent, too. I wanted to try the molten lava chocolate cake, but mistakingly ordered the double chocolate mousse instead - luckily, the latter was sinful enough! I had a few qualms - that night was crowded and the tables too close, and the lighting was a bit too dim. However, I definitely would want to come back, in not for the molten lava chocolate cake
5
Service was really good and the staff welcomed us warmly. They made my husband very happy with attentive details such as printing his name and birthday wish on the menu which we brought home. They also gave him a souffle, took a family picture for us and put it nicely in an envelope, all complimentary.Both my husband and daughter absolutely loved their steak!! Definitely will visit agai
3
The good: Waitstaff were prompt, effusive and helpful (though I wouldn't have expected any less from a 5-star steakhouse like Morton's)The bad: The prime ribeye was a disappointment - meat was lacking in flavour and tough. I'd requested for my steak to be done medium rare, but it was verging on rare. Could have lived with that if the steak had at least been tastier and juicier. The lambchops were also similarly bland and unexciting.Have had better steaks (at far better prices, too) at other restaurants. Will not return
5
We were lucky enough to book a table on New Years Eve. Firstly we had expertly crafted martinis, my fav was Apple, others had Dirty Martinis, which they informed me were excellent, as it was NYE I might have had more than I should but the atmosphere was so good and our waitress (Mary?) was so friendly. Then we moved into the restaurant and ordered our lobster starters which were amazing and I was tasked with smothering butter on the freshly baked loaf of bread on our table, bliss. We were very politely informed that if we would like to go outside we could drink in the atmosphere of the NYE Fireworks celebration in the bay. Words fail me. That view at any time day or night is breathtaking but with family and friends, priceless. Then back to the restaurant to order our STEAK ! Simply the best, as the song goes, we all ordered different cuts and each one of us was jealous of the others meal. We'd ordered plenty of side dishes but to be honest we could eat it all and we are good eaters. Everyone knows this area of SG is expensive, wine is very pricy, but I think Mortons is worth every penny, the quality of food is exceptional the staff were outstanding. I cannot make 2018/19. But I am definitely trying to make 2019/20 NYE celebrations at Mortons

What can you say about Morton’s that hasn’t been already said? This is a serious dining experience and there is a consistency throughout the Morton’s chain, including their location in Marina Bay, as well as their Hong Kong location. It matches the experience I have had at my location Arizona location.My experience at the Marina Bay has always been positive. The welcome is warm and the service is professional. Soon after being seated, our waiter was there to take the orders for martinis, and they were delivered well-shaken and ice-cold, which is essential on a hot Singapore evening.From there we moved on to some very fresh oysters on the half-shell, followed by excellent Caesar salads. The challenge with the menu is the huge variety of options, but this night I had a rare center-cut filet and it was outstanding. We added to the table a serving of hashed-brown potatoes, but had no room for any dessert.This was a nice dining experience, and while there is a cost for this type of meal and ambience, it was well worth it
5
Restaurant was seemingly accommodative to our group of family that gathered to surprise me on my birthday that was well organsied by my husband that was well coordinated by mortons!Your level of service is exceptional made possible by superb staff which is hard to come by yet retain. Hope your restaurant continues to constantly exceed in service and food.Thank you everyone!Cheers,Seren

Very good customer care. Special touch with words with the manager. Very good meat. Musia played a bit too loud for my taste.
4
There is sth that makes be feel relax , comfortable in Morton's & I think it was the staffs , environment & Ofcourse the food was delicious. Very joyful experience.
4
The steak is so delicious that it almost melts in the mouth! Very thoughtful and personalized way to customize the menu with hubby's name for his birthday celebration.
5
A fantastic meal matched with top notch service and ambience. Steak was cooked to perfection and we were really look after by the staff. The onion bread is definitely worth a mention.
5
Excellent service, never had to look for service crew. The service crew is always around us and asked if anything they can help! Feel like a king throughout the fabulous dinner.
3
Vastly overpriced steakhouse which actually meets the standard of the hotel whereas mandarin oriental is normally excellent this place is cold standoffish like the restaurant Quality wise it is supposed to be the best so they say but price does not stand nearly in comparison for what you get and on top there is also a very arrogant atmosphere Dinner for 2 was close to 500 Singapore $ and this did not even include a bottle of wine ! Advise do not go there
5
The steak was fantastic, and my family and i truly enjoyed the food and atmosphere at Mortons Steak House in Singapore. Although we tried many Mortons Steak Houses in ASIA, and we believe the service at Mortons Steak House was beyond our expectation. Cheers for the Staff who has extended their service to us! Best regards.

I went with my partner to the Mortons in Singapore for our year end dinner. We ordered the Cajun & Peppercorn steaks. The server did not make any attempt to let us know that each of the steaks was large enough to comfortablly feed two persons. What a waste of food and such unethical service. Will definitely not be coming back ever
5
The visit got my whole family, from my 70 year-old mother-in-law to my eight year-old son extremely excited.And at the conclusion, the look of complete satisfaction was unanimous on all our faces. The meats were tender and juicy, the vegetables succulent, the double dessert combination of souffle and lava chocolate cake was lapped up even with filled tummies. In fact, even the starter - the onion bread - was such a favourite that we ordered a second one and packed it home.
5
In the States Mortons is one of many chain steak houses but in Singapore it truly shines. The quality of the meat is excellent, in my opinion better than in Florida. The wine list is extensive and diverse. A hot bread loaf is served before the first course and was simply inhaled by all. We had a Rutherford Ranch Cab that went perfectly with our steaks. Started with Lobster Bisque and a Chopped Salad which was main dish size. For the Mains we had two New York Strips which were grilled perfectly (Medium Rare) with sides of spinach and mushrooms. No room for desert. When you need a change from Asian food this is the place to go
4
Went there to celebrate a birthday treat, dinner was not bad and my server (guy with a bun) was very professional and courteous. Food was good as mentioned but not mind blowing either.
4
Food was excellent but American style portions which are way too much. Bring your money with you as if your having two courses and wine your at least $250 each
4
Worth for money, splendid food and nice ambience. Great for steak and dessert lovers and wonderful service.
5
Service was good and food was excellent. Celebrated my wedding anniversary there. They were nice to offer a complimentary dessert.
5
Celebrated my birthday with my hubby and 2 kids here recently and it was a fabulous experience. The steak is really the best in town and I truly enjoyed the ribeye steak although it was really quite large for one serving. I finished the entire 12 oz by myself but I generally have a huge appetite. The service staff were really warm and friendly to my kids too. We had always skipped going there for dinner cos my hubby doesn't eat beef and it's an elegant n romantic restaurant and we had thought they'd not welcome kids but the staff were all really happy to play with my 2 boys. They kept them entertained throughout dinner. The restaurant manager Edwin in particular was exceptional in his service and extremely attentive and friendly. I'd definitely be back soon
4
I have had deeply mixed experiences with Morton's. Steaks are fantastic. Pricey, but very good. The weekday happy hour from 5-7pm is one of the best deals in town. Service is quite uneven. Happy hour wait staff can be awesome, but I have had some memorable experiences for all the wrong reasons. But generally the happy hour staff is quite good.Skip the burgers. I have tried many times and keep having the same experience. Tasty meat is served to you as this bland grey mass. I don't understand how they get the steaks so right and the burgers so wrong, but they do. It's a real shame and I have stopped ordering the burger. It is such a disappointment. Stick with happy hour and the steak sandwiches. That really is your best bet.
5
I've been to Morton's several times and each visit never disappoints. Service staff are always so courteous, efficient and extremely professional. If you're on a budget they have a happy hour every day from 5-7 where they serve martinis for $16 and complimentary steak sandwiches. Dinner here can easily cost between 300 - 800 for two, depending on your menu choices. They also have a set menu at $128 per pax with great value that offers starters such as crab cake, a steak and a dessert For some reason they never ever show the menu until you ask for it. My favourite would be the Ribeye steak on the bone, the tower of tuna and salmon and their soufflé. This is the place to go for special occasions
5
We had martini cocktails on a Friday evening. They are great! Each martini is $15.95 each from 5pm - 7pm. They call it the Mortini Nights. You can choose from the: Classic Mortini * Cosmopolitan * Appletini * Chocolate Mortini * LycheetiniWe had the Cosmo and Lycheetini. Fabulicious.Morton's also serves complimentary Filet Mignon steak sandwiches to every guest.What's not to like
5
We visited here with friends while I was on business in Singapore. I'm unsure if it was the forth or fifth floor of the mandarin oriental but I'm sure it was the best steak I've ever had and that's to date. You can get bigger steaks in Singapore (Hooha cafe) but not better but you do pay through the nose for the dining experience. Not a cheap eatery but you get what you pay for. The welcome we received on arrival was average for a five star establishment but the service and food was second to non

I have been to this restaurant before the renovation, in the days when trolleys laden with half a hunk of cow was briskly pushed past you in the vain rationale that you would manage to stop the attendant and break into a conversation about the various cuts available that night. Not anymore. The restaurant is full of millennials - and while they are probably nice young adults, they lack the obvious saviour faire endeared and showered upon you by the previous team of professional waiters. Morton's lives up to it's name but not up to its reputation, sadly. The steak tartar [flashed by your eyes as a wonderful treat on an entrée card] looks almost too good to be true - lucky they had a good photographer because the actual dish that arrived lacked both the lustre of the picture and along with it the taste it promised. Sadly what could have been a promising opening was a very big disappointment. Conversely, the steak was the star [and why shouldn't it be]. It certainly managed to rise where the tartar did not. I will comment the Chef on the way it was cooked and acknowledge this was one of the better cuts of beef I have eaten lately [if not the best]. The ambiance is so-so, there is a sort of buzz around you but nothing I would associate with elegance. Being in the Mandarin Oriental Hotel you expect a level of decorum but this was like the close of the DJIX with brokers willing to sacrifice all the week's trading for one last attempt at glory. I thought Morton's was going to be on the mark, its why I passed up an evening at CUT in MBS and Osia at ResortsWorld Sentosa, but as with life you live and learn, and next time I won't give nostalgia a chance to prove me wrong like it did tonight

As always a nice dinner of course all American when you crave a bit of good old steak or lobster. Of course also at a big price!

I decided to treat myself on my last night in Singapore. Morton's is not cheap but if you want a really good steak and won't worry about the expense this is the place to go!
5
Loved their center cut prime ribeye, and their staffs are attentive to our needs.
Recommended for dates and family gathering.

Awesome experience at Morton's. Value for money food and service. However personally felt that the light is too dim
4
Awesome steak and services, although it is a bit expensive. Free cake for celebrating birthday is a nice bonus.

Always a joy to dine at Morton's. Attentive service staff, lovely ambience and almost perfect food (if not for the salmon). The salmon was perfectly done, not many restaurants are able to. The downside was the huge portion that what tasted like chinese stir fry vegetables that came along with it, prefer the lemon butter sauce that it was used to be served with (please bring that back!). My partner's steak was done the way he wanted it, and the lava cake is to die for :)

A brilliant waiter saved this from a complete disaster. You go to Morton's expecting to have the steak of the year cooked to perfection and pay accordingly. The price tag was more than there, sadly steak was not worth half what I paid and poorly cooked and the $265 bottle of brunello Montalcino- just overrated grape juice. It had no business being on the wine listt let at that price. $870 later for 2 pax- I left in disgust
5
I must highly recommend that this is a great restaurant choice to celebrate any occasion. They make it special when you mentioned the occasion during the reservation to the time you walk in and seated, to the billing with a custom photo card and the menu. Of course we had steaks and salads, with a complimentary soufflé. The night truly enjoyable. Will be back again

Morton's in my favorite restaurant in the USA, however, it was not the same in Singapore. I stayed in the Mandarin Oriental Hotel and it was great, but this restaurant made me so sick, the hotel staff had to come and clean up the vomit from all over the hotel room. It was awful! I would not recommend it at all

I visited yesterday Morton's Singapore as per recommendation by a local resident and since I craved for some good Western food. Booking was made by phone. The restaurant was easy to find at the Mandarin Oriental, 4th floor. The hotel itself conveys itself a dark, gloomy ambience which extends both to the bars and the restaurants itself, including Morton’s.Welcome was pleasant and they had the reservation and name ready. As described by other reviewers, the seating is spacious and comfortable, feeling of an up-scale diner in a sort of vintage-future setting. That evening predominantly visited by Japanese.I had the following: Mojito and San Pellegrino, 8oz New York Wagyu Steak with Truffle/Parmesan French Fries, Chocolate Mousse and Espresso. Cost about 210 Singapore Dollars incl. taxes, without tips. There is nothing to complain about the food; meat was cooked as ordered medium-rare and a meticulous piece; side dish was tasty and plentiful; chocolate mousse delicious. Large bread “cake” with butter was served prior to the meal. Definitely not hungry anymore after this meal.On the positive side:- Staff plentiful and attentive, well-trained regarding the food offering and preparation- Food was very tasty- Was offered a free cocktail at the end of the meal by the managerOn the negative side:- Somewhat annoying background music as another reviewer also stated- Staff chit-chatting with each other esp. the Filipinos; not affecting their attention but a no-go in an upscale restaurant- Heard the staff push/up-sell at the next table i.e. more than one side-dish per person and the most expensive meat on the menu- When paying with CC, was hinted – though in a nice way – to tip in addition to the service charge leviedOverall:I rate the overall experience 3 out of 5 because of the unfavorable value-for-money ratio. Yes, it is Singapore but that doesn't justify a price that is on par with a Michelin or 18 Point Gault Millau restaurant for this kind of meal and dining
4
If you are looking for a good cut of steak, you can rely on Morton's to deliver great food and service. Staffs are courteous and helpful in making recommendations.
4
This is my 4th visits and this time the Ribeye that I ordered is not as good as my last few visit. Their truffle fries and chocolate cake is still the best.
4
Went with friends and ordered the Australian beef steaks and they were just perfect. Nice n juicy with a selection of sauces available along with breads.
Seating available inside with air conditioning or outside too.
Quick service and good food.
3
the servicing size was generous. The food quality seems to be average and nothing much to rave about. The waiting time is too long.
5
Had the beef taco, prime rib eye and choc soufflés. isn't a fan of taco but my gf really love it. best souffle i ever tried. prime ribeye cooked perfectly, juicy and flavourful.
5
Morton's has some of the best steak in Singapore. Upmarket restuarant with attentive staff. If you are hankering for a great steak and wine then you can't go wrong.
4
The food here is great. No doubt the steak is first class. The wine selection is fantastic. And the starter tuna tower is one of the best tuna dishes I've had. Fresh a bit of a kick - a most wonderful dish to start. The service is good and efficient. No issues. The only issue is the prices. But Singapore can be expensive so it is not that this place is exceptionally pricy but it is certainly far more expensive than an equivalent meal in Melbourne New York or London. Would I come back? Probably yes if you are set on a good dinner in Singapore anyway.
5
I've eaten at a number of restaurants specialising in steaks around the world, and I can say hands down this is the best I've eaten, so good I'm putting my first review on trip advisor. Service was fantastic, meal was fab and of course the company was the best. So good we will be back on Friday before we leave Singapore. ( don't let me down )
4
I made a booking when Mortons started serving Sunday lunches. The set lunch seemed to be an excellent value with three courses at SGD 65++. But then the additions crept in. Beef tenderloin $15 surcharge. Sauce $5 surcharge. Hendricks martini $29. Bottle of sparkling water $14. A simple lunch ended up costing over $150! An order to add crabmeat was forgotten. An apology but no attempt at service recovery. Would I return? Only if someone else paid. I hadn't returned in 10 years. There is a reason why. Food was good and service was friendly but is this enough
3
Ordered a caipirinha from the bar even though is not in the menu. Drink came extremely strong, the sugar and lime was not added in. I called for the service staff again and told them of the problem. They took the drink back and served again. No apologies given and this time, even though the drink was correct, it was obviously not made fresh and new. It was merely sugar and lime added and put in a tall glass. So that is a great bid disappointment for me. Food, we shared a steak and a dessert. We wanted pink and but steak came tough. SoufflÃ© too puffed up, too much sugar as it was crispy and inside soggy and runny, over obviously too hot, outside cooked too fast and inside not done enough. Though service at the restaurant is good, but because of the disappointment from both the bar and food, I will not go there again. For the price, plenty better options in Singapore.
5
Delicious food, impeccable and attentive service, and a nice selection of wines and cocktails! A great dining and drinking experience! Thank you!
5
We have been dining at Morton's for a long time and I have never written a review. Guess I have taken for granted the excellent service and great food that we were spoilt for.
4
Came here on Saturday with some friends. Surprisingly they have a happy hour Monday-Saturday from 5-7pm. $15.95 for cocktails and they bring around free steak sandwiches. They call them steak sandwiches but I would say a sliver of meat and some sweet bread. In no way is this going to fill you up, but its nice to soak up some of the booze. It's very very dark inside. I'm not sure why so dark, but I guess that adds to the 'sexy vibe'. I've eaten at Morton's several times in Chicago and it had a very similar feel. Great spot to escape the heat for a few and grab a strong cocktail
4
After hearing much about Morton's we decided to try them out to celebrate our 9th anniversary. First and foremost, I have to say I was extremely impressed with the way they customized our dinner experience. We had our very own personalized menu wishing us happy anniversary, the table had confetti on it, we were given a complimentary soufflé and out photograph was taken and presented to us in a personalized card to help us celebrate the occasion. Other than that we had very pleasant service staff including a lady named Zara. Her service made us feel extremely welcomed. As for the food, we tried the baked garlic butter oyster, onion soup, waygu beef, peppercorn rubbed beef, pan fried brussel sprouts and horse radish mashed potatoes. Other than the peppercorn rubbed beef which felt a bit tough even though it was cooked medium (probably because it is meant to be mostly lean meat) and didn't rock tastebuds, the other dishes were awesome. Perhaps we should have taken Zara recommendations on the beef. Besides the complimentary lemon soufflé (which was alright), we also ordered the chocolate lava cake which was yummy but a tad too sweet for my liking. Definitely hope to be back to try more of the items on the menu
5
Having tried both the Michelin star awarded Wolfgang Pucks Cut and the less Hollywood Chicago high end steak chain outlet in the mandarin oriental our family all voted for Morton's steak being the superior steak. Dark traditional atmosphere great service exemplifies high end American steak. Both the large rib eye and the filet mignon medium rare are great choices. The seafood platter appetizer with truffle fries and onions rings makes a great dinner and splurge dinner. Make sure your credit card is fire proofed as you will drop a bomb here. Everything is premium priced especially the eye watering wine list. Good example of old adage you get what you pay for.
3
I had cocktails and bar snacks with friends at Morton's Bar in August 2016. The cocktails were excellent - large and strong and tasty. The bar snacks were a mixed bag (some very good, some just OK). The service was OK/good but not excellent (and it wasn't busy). The bar was very dark, too dark really. In future, I would go during their happy bar promotions but avoid at other times. The other bars in the hotel are much better if you are paying full price and they have superb service.
4
Having drink is expensive in singapore, so why not get your monies worth in a fancy hotel with free sandwiches for 2 hours mon-fri 5-7pm?We did, staff were friendly and the place was very busy.Price for 4 (very nice) cocktails and about 10 finger steak sandwiches £44.Happy with that
3
Having heard so much about Morton's and having wanted to eat here for many years, I finally made it.But, on the whole, it was a let-down.Initially, the restaurant is really impressive (with an amazing wine-list) and a throwback to fine-dining of the 60s and 70s, with plush sofas and glittering chandeliers. But the ambience is ruined by music that is totally inappropriate...loud, generic "pop" which, we were told, was the result of a management decision to replace the jazz standards that used to be played. A pity...and a stupid decision indeed.But what of the "meat and potatoes"? To start with (literally) the lobster cocktails were truly divine, delicious and succulent, and augured well for the steaks to come. But these turned out to be shockingly stringy...and were replaced by better cuts; but lacking, second time round, in flavour. And the size was certainly NOT what we ordered. And this, in a restaurant which prides itself on the quality of its beef!Good service though, attentive and courteous.And the cost of this good-in-parts meal for two; and a HALF bottle of Bordeaux? Over 500 Singapore dollars.The money was NOT an issue. The experience just didnt match-up
1
Our steaks were under done and all three sides were poorly done. The $40+ crab cake was really not worth the price. The salad was drown by the sauce. The ambience was really poor contributed by the poor service, bad music and activities from the kitchen. Staff looked very stressed and not well trained. They offered to transfer our drinks from the bar but later could not find our drinks.. Which is quite bizarre!

I visited Morton’s at the Mandarin Oriental in Singapore for a solo dinner in July 2016.I’ve visited some of the Morton’s locations in the US, and so was very much looking forward to this experience.From the outset, things were very professional indeed. I had a glass of excellent white wine in the lovely (but very dark) bar, then went into the main restaurant. The waiter was extremely friendly, and seemed genuinely happy to be working there. (Being from London, I don’t see this very often!).The food was uniformly good - at least up to the US standard of Morton’s menu items. I had the delightful crab cocktail, followed by the NY Strip steak which was perfectly cooked. Being on my own, I found it unfortunate that all the side dishes are huge (and hugely expensive). I settled on a baked potato, which was spectacular.I skipped dessert, but was approached by the manager and, in a wonderful act of generosity, was offered a complimentary digestif. I chose the excellent Calvados, which was delivered in an extremely heathy portion!Upon leaving, all staff members were effusive in their thanks. Whilst the food was good, the staff is what made the experience great.The only minus point (and reason for the 4 stars, instead of 5) is the price. It really is MONSTROUSLY expensive. I had a starter, a main, a side and 2 glasses of wine. Including service and tax, the bill came to S$350. Very, very steep indeed. I get the feeling that, as with their US locations, Morton’s is designed for businessmen and expense accounts.It was also interesting to note that their signature pig-shaped oil lamps have been upgraded to LED technology. Very impressive!I certainly recommend Morton’s in Singapore. I doubt you’ll find better service anywhere in the country. I’d recommend it even more if you can ensure someone else is picking up the bill
5
had baked scallops as a starter, bone-in fillet mignon (both limited time specials), and a glass of red,- S$245 (incl. taxes/services). yes, expensive, but this is mandarin oriental premise.
service was good, friendly and attentive.
5
A week night happy hour is an excellent experience, cocktails and free flow steak sandwiches. It keeps you just on the right side of the strong cocktails they serve.
4
Persuaded my colleagues to go here rather than Ruth's Chris which is walking distance away. I normally like both and they serve pretty good American steaks. I know many US folks will cringe at these chains but they're better than most steak houses outside the US if you fancy a taste of home, really in Singapore there are much better choices for local cuisine but we were working late in the hotel. The steaks were ok but I've had better - and better at the Ruth's Chris, apart from that this was an as expected Mortons - good decor, wine, food, clean and a bit price
3
Seen good reviews about this place and I decided to give it a try. First off, portions for sides and appetizers are big so order conservatively. The steaks were good and prepared to our desired doneness although it may not be the best quality beef that you would get compared to the other steak houses. The Appetizer and sides however, not that great. Does not taste as how a 30$ plate of food should taste like.If you like martini, the Lychee martini is one of the best I've drank so far, that's highly rated by me. An oh. stay off the coffee - It's not great
4
My wife and I ate here whilst on holiday in Singapore, it was recommend to us by one of the staff in our hotel.The restaurant has a very elegant and luxurious feel to it, staff are excellent, very helpful, and knowledgeable. The menu is varied even if you're not a meat lover (which my wife isn't). The food was cooked well, and was tasty, they even made us a free SoufflÃ© as we were celebrating our anniversary, as well as taking a photograph which they printed out and put in a card. Very nicely done, and made us feel special.Thoroughly recommend this place, we'd certainly go again
5
Having relocated to China three years ago, I became vegetarian! Not because I don't like meat of any kind, but because of quality control uncertainty! I knew I could totally rely on Morton's for a wonderful, mouth watering, quality dinner- beef!!!!!! I felt like I had died and gone to beef heaven! The service was top of the line and no question of the wine selection being great! Well done!! Pricey, but what do you expect from high quality food and beverages?
4
Celebrated spouse birthday at Morton's steakhouse. Nice ambiance and great service. The servings are relative huge. Good enough to share. We had 2 adults and 2 kids, ordered only 2 mains and 2 sides. And that was already quite a struggle to finish up the food. Not that they are not delicious but servings were generous. The steak was well cooked and on in my opinion, it's overpriced. I'd similar quality or better at other steakhouses prior. But if you want a place to impress your date, this is it
4
We were a party of 4 and it's our first time to Mortons. A little turnoff at the start as the staff who called said we had only 2 hours to finish our meal as there was a booking next. (it did not happen to us at Wooloomooloo, so i was quite taken aback). Nonetheless, it was not full on a Sunday night, so i'm not sure what the staff was referring to, that there's a booking after our seating. Anyway, they didnt chase us away either. We had the anniversary menu. Our steak was done as we ordered and were delicious. Starters were great! We ordered the crab cakes and scallops! Love them! We had an ala carte of lobster bisque. However, the wine in the lobster bisque was too overwhelming, we could taste more wine than the lobster in the soup, definitely not for non-drinkers, rather disappointing. Lava cake was good though! Some staffs were attentive while the others were not at all, had to wave our hands to get their attention. Lighting in the restaurant was slightly too dim as well. Would likely not return unless on a special occasion
2
1 unbelievably expensive even for Singapore!!2 of course as a single person, given the worst table, right behind the host station, staff walking \ running right against the back of your seat 3 teak was underdone, despite offer for new steak, it just cooked longer, and same vegetables were reheate
1
I have been going to Mortons for over 15 years. Every time I visit Singapore and have enjoyed their steaks and ambience. However, this visit has been a large disappointment. It is a few years since my last visit but the performance has deteriorated significantly. Firstly, the food quality is lower and the prices higher. Definitely not value for money. The side dishes were especially very poor. The potatoes au gratin seemed old and recycled. It felt like the chef had lost the plot and did not know how to create mouth watering food. Secondly, the theater that came in visiting Mortons is gone. No food trolly showing the quality of the fresh produce and no detailed explaination of the food and its origins. Finally, the music is too loud and completely inappropriate. It is now a very ordinary steak house which is over priced. I will NOT be going back either with the family or for businesss outings. There are now much better steak places in Singapore. PS Normally I include photos of the food to show how great it looks, however in this case it was such a disappointment that I did not take a single photo
4
Table, ambience, menu and service were all solid. Service in particular was very good. They do 6oz steaks, a nice size for me. Pricing is high, yet that is expected - Singapore on the whole is not cheap.
5
Although expensive, even by Singapore standards, I have not found a better steak anywhere in Singapore. Great food, great service, great atmosphere.
3
Had high expectations of this steakhouse as it was constantly rated as top 5 steakhouse in many websites. The ambience was a bit rowdy as the noise from bar was very loud. The lights were so dim that i could barely tell if my steak was welldone or not. Ordered a center cut ribeye based on the waiter's recommendation. When they serve my steak, i was shock by the size of the steak. A third of it would be enuff for me. The taste is ok but i expected much more for a 99 dollar steak.Service is great and the waiters were constantly checking see if everything is ok. But i can't help but feel that they are just going through the motion..Expect to pay abt $150 per pax for a steak with starters... more if you order drinks and deserts.Unlikely that i will return for a second tim
5
Our dinner was to celebrate a birthday and an anniversary, and we were very happy with our choice of dishes and the level of service and attention at Morton's.Whilst not cheap -no steakhouse in Singapore will ever be cheap- it is one very welcoming and well-run establishment. The steaks are delicious - and so are the sides and the martinis at the bar - and the staff is very attentive and cordial.And if you are celebrating a birthday you get a souffle for free. My son was very pleased with this surprise!We will definitely return
4
My husband and I like Morton's and we've visited this restaurant not only in Singapore but in the US many times. Food is great, service is excellent. But how do you pair an upscale, expensive restaurant with the Rolling Stones and Justin Bieber?? Last time we went here, Chicago blues and jazz were playing...this time we had a loud ensemble of bad pop music more suitable for a Friday's. On departure my husband asked the Western manager about the music, but he said that the head office supplies this directly from Chicago, so there is nothing they can do. Really? Am guessing this was either a poor excuse or the person who is making this decision from Chicago should be demoted to dishwasher
5
Went here with my wife to celebrate our anniversary. I was a bit surprised to see so many families with small kids (was hoping more of a relaxed romantic dinner). However the service was great, we ordered the prime rib (the one thats only avail sat & sun), woww... the size was huge, split it with my wife, and taste really really good !!and also the crabcake was awesome!! definitely must try!! we guarantee to come back to taste other foods, looking fwd to order the seafoods... btw, we've had a free choco soufflè
5
We have gone to Morton all around the world. This is a great one. The Manager came over several times to check on us. We spent 4 hours and never felt rushed. Food is always of high standards and they nicely checked on us many times to make sure we did not want anything. Service was excellent. Timing of bring out courses was perfect with time to relax in between.Yes please go this restaurant
5
Had dinner with my friend at one of top steakhouse "Morton's" located at Level 4 of Mandarin Oriental Hotel.It was my friend's birthday, a special menu written specially for him & the Hot Chocolate Lava dessert was on the house.Restaurant was packed on Sunday night. A little noisy but still fine. Helpful and informative waiters and waitress with personalised service.Enjoyed a 3-course dinner at about SGD $220 per person. Costly but enjoyed
4
Good steak, better sides, and even better service. - 6oz filet steak was good and cooked perfectly. I was surprised to see that it was not the thick cut filet I'm used to (from CUT and other high end steakhouses) - it was a much flatter version (pounded?)- mac 'n' cheese was amazing with a good cheddar flavor and crispy top- fluffy mashed potatoes came with optional toppings (sour cream, bacon bits)- my water glass was never below half full- multiple staff came by to check on our meal and ensure everything was to our satisfactio
5
A little hidden away inside the Mandarin but well worth seeking out. Morton's are pretty much always great but the Singapore restaurant really is superb! I shared a 1kg Porterhouse steak with my friend & it really was one of the best steaks I've eaten.The service is great & ultra professional & the restaurant looks good although nothing spectacular.All in all, the best steak house Singapore has to offer
4
Thank you so much for the dinner!
Very big and flavor steak amazing dinner!
The steak was perfect, very good service, definitely be back to see you!!
5
5 of us went for the happy hour.
The service was outstanding and super friendly
The appys were really yummy. I will return.
5
First time I try this steak house in my life. I hope to visit this restaurant as soon as possible with my family. I will never forget the tests.
3
Comes with a big reputation and I had such high expectations. Steaks smelled good on the grill, taste was so-so. Average but filling. Typical grilled steak in a very expensive place.
5
The Prime Rib is quite large, melted in your mouth, tasty and more than enough for two.
Special thanks to Justin our server for the evening.
5
My wife and I are big fans of MORTON's and have been lucky enough to go to quite a few of their establishments in different destinations. There are a few rules that you need to know if you visit a MORTON's: 1. It will not be cheap. 2. Either have a steak or a MORTON's 'Signature Dish'. 3. Always share a sliced beef steak tomato with blue cheese dressing. 4. Allow a minimum of 2+ hours to really enjoy & savour the experience. The MORTON's at the Mandarin Oriental, Singapore is a great restaurant...a stunning room, with stunning food and service to match. All of our dishes were presented magnificently and my wife's 12 oz Filet Mignon was cooked to perfection--I had the Signature "Chicken Christopher" which was equally delicious!!! All in all, this is a "top notch" dining experience that you can really enjoy...a wonderful experience...thanks MORTON's !!
5
On the 5th floor of the Mandarin Oriental Hotel they have one of my favourite restaurants - Mortons. It is expensive but high quality. The staff are very good and the service pretty quick and smooth. Everything you'd come to expect from Mortons if you've been to other branches of the chain
2
Not feeling particularly hungry, the 3 of us only had mains - 2 x 6oz filet mignions and a 16 oz prime rib eye with truffle fries and sauteed brussel sprouts. Plus a large bottle of still mineral water to share. The bill came out at S$402.50 incl 10% service charge. In terms of quality (particularly in relation to the price), nothing was worth writing a postcard about. I have eaten far better rib-eye steaks for a third of the price. Charging S$22 for the sprouts (in all honesty, I cook far tastier sauteed sprouts!) and S$24 for the fries was a bit much. To top it all, the waitress (albeit very sweetly) pointed out that "tips are not included..." My reply was that I don't believe in tipping except for outstanding service when service charge is already included. For a place that charges so much (for thoroughly uninspiring grub), training, encouraging or even permitting their staff to ask for tips just degrades the establishment. How fondly I recall the phenomenal Hida beef in Takayama and the wonderful practice throughout Japan of refusing tips..!
4
I had the 2 pound lobster and it was done perfect! The steak was also very good. Am very pleased with the service as well. Totally love the cheesecake. The ambiance was excellent but the music was a little off for such environment though. Highly recommend as dinner date if the music was soothing and soft
5
Martini time at the upstairs bar from 5 pm daily. The lychee martini's are the best. And are half price. Free mini steak sandwiches passed from 5 to 7. The restaurant itself is typical , very dark, expensive, and delivers amazing lobster and steaks. A must do every time I come to SIngapore.
5
Everything that you'd expect from Morton's. Slightly more expensive than the U.S. Still great service. Substantially similar menu.
5
Tonight we were having dinner at Morton's Steak House. Not the first time here but always surprised me with the quality of food. I ordered a crab cake for appetizer, and a mixed barbecue consisting of a fillet mignon, bacon wrapped scallops and prawn with some asparagus and some greens, for mains. The Morton's salad we shared was fresh and crispy. Service was above standard. I also like the bread. Very delicious
4
Steak was super yum - tasty and tender. Very importantly it was up to expectations and mind you, expectations were high as we were celebrating a significant birthday and everyone at he table was a big steak fan! Even the kiddos were happy and this place is surprisingly kid friendly! A big plus in our book. Extra points too for yummy side dishes that were a lot larger than we thought they would be. Kudos also for delicious dessert and attentive yet not over bearing service. Even more brownie points to the lovely waitress who recommended a very good and extremely well priced wine to go with our meal. Thank you for an excellent evenin
5
It has been quite a few years since I last visited Morton's - blame it on the plethora of restaurants that keep popping up.The food doesn't disappoint - I love the crab cakes, cream corn and mac & cheese. The complimentary bread and souffle were wonderful. My husband enjoyed his steak though the lobster bisque seemed a tad salty.The service was impeccable. Justin who served us was one of the best service staff I have encountered for a long time.After getting used to new contemporary decor that restaurants seem to favour these days, the warm , cosy ambience of Morton's was a refreshing change.I was glad my hubby chose this classic restaurant for our wedding anniversary. They are experts in turning a nice dinner to a special one - from personalised menus to complimentary dessert and special photo momento. Thank you Morton's
5
I booked Morton's for my son's 18th birthday, and it didn't disappoint on any level. Obviously though, it's not going to be a cheap night out, by any standard.We were shown to our table, which was strewn with glitter and the menus had been personalised with birthday congratulations, my son's name and the date. He's not one for a fuss but I think he was a bit chuffed.Food was amazing. As a not-particularly enthusiatic beef eater, I went for the smallest - a 6 oz fillet mignon. Utterly delicious, but still too big for me. The dinner conversation pretty much stopped as everyone chowed down. The sides were perfect and the service was top-notch.And the birthday lava cake was a perfect ending (for those that could fit it in).A very special birthday dinner, indeed
5
The steak is great. Not a surprise. Expected. I know that's now fair to expect. It's the best steak or one of the best in Singapore. I don't care about the new Japanese fatty steaks, the idea of a heart attack makes me sick... Lol Get a good USDA grade steak all fashion blue and enjoy.
4
Ok , so I've been a Mortons fan since the 90 and as far as steak quality, it's tough to beat. The Grill master /Chef is top notch and delivers and exquisite steak . IN the same mold , the sous chefs prepare a Sea Bass that rivals any top rate seafood restaurant in the region ... so you might ask me why no 5 star.....Jr rookie servers . When you lay down 8 bills for a two person meal , I expect on the spot service. Also, while an extensive wine list was on offer, there was no sommelier to walk us through the wine list. But really , why to I go to Mortons ?? it's all about the beef !!! and on that point you will not find a better 100 dollar porterhouse in the City !! Hands down .

This is actually about the Morton's bar in the Mandarin Oriental, not the restaurant proper. Stopped in for drink post conference session, and ordered what is an easy thing to make, a Manhattan. What I got instead was a grossly watered down, nearly tasteless drink that cost almost $40! I actually watched it being made, and know exactly the problem. The bartender shook it for close to a minute, resulting is something that had zero flavor and left me not caring if I ever had another drink again. It was so bad I did not even have the enthusiasm to complain (the jet lag didn't help there either). Just horrible

i love the singapore morton's, and the food is exactly as amazing as every other morton's (for me that includes the 12 oz filet, the au gratin potatoes, and the grand marnier soufflet). only drawbacks here: the prices are just nuts (i'm sure this is a non-issue to the many big-expense-account business clients). plan on spending about $350 - $400 for two people. other minor issue on this visit: one of our waiters had very weak english, and we had to ask him to repeat things multiple times (and still didn't know what he was saying a couple times). this might sound horribly ethnocentric; but english is the official language of singapore, after all

My family has eaten here six times to celebrate occasions; rightfully so because the cajun steak delights,and service is efficient. IN addition, the restaurant is nicely appointed. Tip: Reserve a booth. And let them know if it's your birthday because the restaurant prints a menu with the celebrant's name on it, and offers a complimentary choco lava cake that is divine..

Great martini during the happy hour of 5-7pm accompanied by complementary fillet mignon sandwich, reasonably priced (for Mandarin Oriental).
4
Staying at a nearby hotel and decided to go for the steakhouse rather than the buffet next door. Did not disappoint. Sides were probably too much, but the waitress did warn us about that.
3
A bit noisy and the food is so so. Service is good but prepare to pay more for the service and the food
Great for birthday or anniversary

The food was good, wine was good but the service was horrible.
Getting rushed to down the wine and get out of the restaurant is definitely not the way you want to spend a romantic dinner...
Utterly disgusted by that.

I love the ribeye. The cut is really as close to perfect as it gets for a large chain. For me, one of the best as a global brand, in terms of consistency in food quality and service.I feel a bit guilty about the size. Everything, including sides, is just huge; taking from their Chicago heritage, I guess

Morton's is always on my to do list when in Singapore. I have not had a bad experience there to date. The only fault I find is I liked the decor before they re-vamped it. It had an old world charm with its booths and red wood features. I accept a modern change but it's lost its charm and I feel they have crammed too many tables in there so it now feels crowded and noisy. Apart from that (which is personal opinion) the food is divine! I had the center-cut filet mignon, medium rare and it was perfect. My bf had the signature cut prime new york strip and he says is the best steak he's ever eaten. Shared sides of Parmesan & Truffle Matchstick Fries, mac & cheese and asparagus, all delicious. Generous size portions for the side dishes so we could not eat the entire meal (3 ppl). The service is prompt and the staff are friendly and knowledgeable. I would strongly suggest making a booking as each time I have been it is full with people waiting for tables. The prices are not cheap however worth every penny in my opinion. A fantastic dining experience with fantastic food
5
Although a little pricey (around SGD 100 for a Rib eye Steak), this place served incredibly good classic American steaks. Portions are big and the meat is just unbelievably good. Try their blue cheese sauce but avoid bÃ©arnaise which was disappointing (curdled, buttery and lack of tarragon)!

Walked in to Morton's last month when I was in Singapore without any reservation with my daughter, got seated at bar counter. Food was excellent cocktails was very nice. But the bartender "Sugen" spoiled the entire experience with his fake and overdoing service. He even flirt with my daughter and offer her his mobile number and even offer to bring her around Singapore and Malaysia. What a Proffesional service in a 5 star restaurant. All this done when I went to the gents.Swearing and using vulgar words out loud seems very common even infront of guest!Using mobile phones, drinking openly, slamming things, touching his face and hair etc etc etc.The worst bar and bartender I ever visited and seen. I can accept all this if I'm in a low scale bar... But in Morton's its unexceptable
5
Dine in for a Business Meeting here for the first time and heard a lot of greatness about this place before.The restaurant is high class, dim dark and service is top!The cuisines was more than I had expected. I don't remember the meal name I ate, the Sales Manager called it the Million Dollar Burger. Hahaha! But it's good.Price is high though as it is in the hotel. Definitely come back again

We selected this restaurant based on a local foodie blog review. The overall Mortons experience left us feeling like we'd been charged for someone else's meal. Let me explain...Starting with the positive - the bread was lovely and arrived with soft butter, drinks of decent measures and strengths, and the side of creamy spinach cooked very well. The cons - we opted for a porterhouse cooked medium rare. It was the plainest steak I've ever tasted (just no taste at all - I've cooked much better at home) and it was cooked rare. Massive fail. The meat was also cold on the inside upon the first piece of steak eaten - not good! Mash was lumpy and not creamy despite the description, and the truffle and parmesan fries were coated in so much truffle oil it was over-whelming. The blue cheese sauce we ordered did not arrive, however a cold gravy flavored sauce was provided instead. When asked if we were enjoying the meal, we mentioned that the meat was cold and were offered the option of heating it up for 2 mins. We politely declined in the fear of a microwave job. Despite our obvious discontent with the meal (we left a lot of the steak) we were offered a free desert which we declined and a free tea which we accepted. The bill for this shocker of a meal including taxes came to over $600 Singapore Dollars. The is without a doubt the most expensive steak I've ever had in my life (it made the Hawksmoor in London look cheap!). And whats more, pretty much the worst. We also observed a few other diners complaining of their meal while we were there which was quite disheartening. It should be noted that the waiting staff are very attentive and really do try their best, offering to take photographs, asking questions about your trip and generally very quick to clear / clean the table and refill drinks. Overall a very sad end to or last night in Singapore. We were hoping for a five star restaurant situated in a five star hotel and left with only a five star priced bill. If given the option of having a meal there again (even for free) I would politely decline and certainly eat elsewhere.
4
The tenderloin was excellent despite being overcooked. I requested it medium but it was served more like well done. Despite this the quality of the meat shows through. The asparagus and baked potatoes were also great.
5
Excellent food and ambience, great attention and variety of dishes beyond steaks. We loved the filet mignon, T-bone steak and side dishes. Good service and nice desserts although a bit expensive for the value offered.
5
The quality of meat and quality of preparing and cooking processed here is win over CUT or Wooloo. The services was very attentive. The decorations is nice. And the price is High but worth it.
3
Savor some of the finest, juiciest USDA prime cuts (try the porterhouse). Could and should have been four stars except for the price which is higher than for some Michelin starred restaurants in Europe. For American food? No thanks.
2
First of all, we are world travelers and have been to some of the best steakhouses around the world. Morton's is a well established name globally for steaks, we were very excited to go and have a nice dinner in Singapore.This restaurant is completely over rated. Steaks were ok but arrived in a puddle of blood, side dishes were tasteless, and the wine was of average quality (especially when it appears that the $179 bottle we ordered costs 10 Euros in France).Very disappointed
4
As were were staying at the Manadarin eating in Mortons was an obvious choice.Our Party were very familiar with this chain (outlets in Houston) The eatery was buzzy and busy (Thurday evening) The steaks were cooked to perfection and the starters too were tasty. The wine choice was expansive also.No hesitation - if its Meat you are after, then look no further
2
I've eaten here several times and the service is hit and miss. One night the service is good and another it's atrocious!For last night's meal we both ordered the NY 20 oz steak and some sides. My wife's steak came out piping hot (the way a steak should be) and mine came out almost stone cold!! I thought it was strange when I put truffle butter on it and two minutes later it hadn't even started to melt. I thought it was a little strange and when I took my first bite I couldn't believe it. To their credit I told the wait staff and they whisked it away for a quick warm up ( hopefully not in the microwave) and it was back in 10 minutes. I can't for the life of me understand why my wife's was hot and mine was cold?? I'm assuming they were cooked at the same time. Not sure how long mine was sitting around for (quite a long time by the temperature I suspect).If this was a complicated dish, perhaps new on the menu then I could understand the odd stuff up here and there but this is a steak!! The bread and butter of Mortons. Is this not what you are famous for?Not what I was expecting from a $140 Steak!

I booked for a beefy anniversary dinner, and they really know how to make it special. Right from the time we entered - we saw our table embellished, our menu card read "Happy anniversary", we had complimentary dessert on the house. And not to miss, the steak was as nice as could be. the host & attendant took great care of us, and gave us a memorable card with our evening's photo captured. All in all a great evening

My wife planned the birthday dinner @ Morton's. Usually we will celebrate my birthday overseas, but we were not prepares to travel this year. This is my first visit to Morton's Singapore. The restaurant spots an old day American feel. The staff were very welcoming and explained the menu in great details. My wife ordered the French onion soup, while I ordered the lobster bisque as starters. Our mains were prime cut and sirloin steak, respectively. The foods were decently delicious. A good place to celebrate important dates
5
This is a very reliable steakhouse, and absolutely matches the standards and quality of the US originals. The recent refurbishment has made subtle but effective changes. The space is more welcoming and achieves a good "steakhouse" vibe - smart clean white tablecloths, solid furniture, suitable lighting.You come for the steaks obviously and they're very, very good - a good selection of cuts, well-aged, tasty and very well prepared. I eat my steak medium to medium-well which can attract the ire of steak snobs, but I get perfectly cooked food here every time I come. I've occasionally had better steaks elsewhere, and you shouldn't look for any particular mind-blowing "wow" moments from your meal here, but all dishes are very good, the atmosphere is convivial, the wine-list has some excellent options and the bill is acceptable. I think you'll need to be very unlucky to leave here disappointed.The bar is another strong plus point. They do an excellent happy hour with very good "mortini's" and free filet mignon sandwiches. Very acceptable
4
As always this place is excellent. Food service and atmosphere first class. Yes it is expensive but with that comes quality.
5
They do serve one of the best steaks in town, and the serving is huge. The only drawback is that it is quite expensive. But if you want to treat yourself to something high end, this is one good suggestion.
5
We had a super supper - nice atmosphere and staff very helpful and friendly. The beef is of course amazing, and we really loved the bread they bring t the table, although it was a little too much for my my DH finished it off!! We will be back

This is one of a number of these restaurants located internationally. This one was on the 4th floor of the Marina International Hotel.We have been lucky enough to have been to two other Morton's, San Francisco and Hong Kong so we knew roughly what to expect re the cost,but even then the final cost rather staggered us.It was our wedding anniversary in a couple of days and we informed the hotel concierge of that when he arranged the booking.On arrival we were greeting with "happy anniversary " a greeting which was repeated by the next four table servers. This set the tone for the marvelous service we received for the remainder of the night.Calculated wine had a mark up of approximately 500% but alcohol is very expensive in Singapore due to taxes.We both chose the mixed grill for the main and which consisted of a 6oz fillet steak, two scallops wrapped in bacon, and three king prawns, all resting on a bed of asparagus . We also chose the cognac sauce. The steaks were both absolutely perfect in every way, succulent, juicy and cooked just right. The sauce was a perfect compliment to the steak, never overpowering but rather complimenting the meat. We added a share serve Parmesan Truffle matchstick fries. Alas,although they were delicious we were unable to finish them due to the very abundant steak. However the complementary Souffle (for the wedding anniversary) was extremely light and tasty, and this DID disappear.Whilst I am glad we do not celebrate every wedding anniversary at Morton's because of the cost, I almost wish we could .At the completion of the meal we were presented with a souvenir menu with Best Wishes on your Wedding Anniversary printed on it (also gives us a reminder of the cost!) and a photograph of the two of us also detailing the event.These are only little touches but they define just how high the level of service is at this establishmentDining at Morton's, particularly with the service at Singapore, was a treat and perhaps could be used for very, very special occasions, because just dining there is just that, a special occasion.Would rate higher if allowed, but please be conscious of the cos

Went here on a Friday night, the first night of the F1 weekend with my wife and we really enjoyed the food. We made reservations a few days in advance and on the day of the dinner, they kindly called me to reconfirm the reservation and offer directions to their restaurant as a lot of the roads around their location were closed due to the F1 race. I had the 6oz filet and my wife and the center-cut prime ribeye and both were cooked to our request. I had mine medium rare and my wife had her's rare. We ordered 3 sides, creamed spinach, macaroni & cheese and au gratin potatoes. Everything was very tasty. We couldn't complain about the food and the services was friendly and attentive, but not in your face. It is pricey but when you want quality, you do have to pay for it in Singapore
5
I've tried CUT by Wolfgang Puck, and I can't agree with all that boo-ha about how good it is. In truth Morton's beat CUT hands down. I can only conclude that the people who choose CUT don't really know what a good steak really tastes like

I’m a steak fanatic and any chance I get to visit a steakhouse; I jump on it. So, I was quite excited to finally get the chance to try Morton’s Steakhouse at the Mandarin Oriental. Unfortunately, I left with a fairly unmemorable experience and without hesitation can recommend alternatives that provide an overall better dining experience, food quality, and price point.Located on the second or third floor of the Mandarin Oriental, it’s not the easiest place to find. The front is quite narrow, so you’ll need to keep your eyes open. The façade and signage is nice and promising. Upon entering, there is a nice cocktail bar which creates a decent ambiance. There were three of us (guys) and we had a few beers before dinner. One in our group ordered a $29 Margarita – disappointingly it was a mix (and if it wasn't, it sure tasted like one) Not a great impression.Once we sat down, the service was casual and lively, which is not something you tend to get in Singapore. It was refreshing to have a bit of a laugh with the waiters and sommelier, who was quite knowledgeable. We didn’t have any appetizers, instead just went right for the meat. I ordered a bone-in rare steak and this is where my disappointment came, there was no bone and the steak was fairly thin, which meant to cook it to my liking there'd be no char aka Chicago style. Instead I got a steak, while ok for taste (could have used more seasoning), that was a little grey and looked boring.We ordered a number of sides for the table which were okay. However, the asparagus was a disaster soaked in balsamic vinegar – horrible. Plus, the stalks were so thick, that the only sweetness of the asparagus was found in the tips. To finish it off were some coffees and carrot cake. I have to say though, despite a fairly blasé main course, the carrot cake was one of the best I’ve had!Check time. Just shy of $500 / person. I’m well accustomed to Singapore dining prices and $500 a person, while certainly on the higher end of the spectrum, was certainly not worth the food and dining experience at Morton's. For about $100/ person less, you can probably have a much better time at some of the other steakhouses in Singapore… I’d just give this place a miss. I think it’s very much a case of riding the reputation name from the US and a place for people to show off a little. The setup and feel of the restaurant would be ideal for a business dinner or date but be prepared for a fairly average yet expensive experience

I was advised that Mortons was the best steak restaurant in Singapore. Happily I was staying at the hotel where the restaurant was situated. Book early, the restaurant fills up quickly. It is not cheap by any stretch of imagination. I have eaten steak as good, for much less, but that does not detract from this restaurant, because the beef is all imported in.I had a very nice filet mignone steak, with Asparagus, crab lumps and Bearnaise sauce. Straw potatoes with Parmesan and truffle oil all rounded off with a decent Creme Brûlée. Very attentive staff all rounded off a good meal. When I made the booking I was advised that the dress code was 'Smart Casual'. This is however not enforced. I saw patrons in flip flops, tank tops and shorts. Maybe it is the region the restaurant is in.However all in all I really enjoyed my meal
3
Dinner at Morton's should only be tackled if you haven't eaten for several days. Portions are huge, but they come at an eye-watering price. The wine list is just mind bogglingly expensive and, as a result we didn't order any wine. We were too full for dessert and so didn't have one. A much better experience could be had by the customer if portions were more modest and came at a more reasonable price - we could even have had room for dessert. Not sure what to recommend about the wine list other than moving he decimal point - and I am being entirely serious in that commen
5
First I'll talk about the service. Good service is almost impossible to find in Singapore but Morton's is the exception. Attentive staff and real knowledge about the menu and food. A real gem in Singapore.Now the food. The seafood appetizers are the best. A little pricey, but what isn't in Singapore. Steaks are really good, cooked to order. This is one of my favorites in Singapore
5
Private room for a party of 13. The food was faultess as always and the only downside was that service was a little slow compared to normal. Seth and his team delivered another very enjoyable evening and we can't wait to go back.
3
I find the place too dark.
The steak are done nicely. Although I personally prefer Japanese Wagyu than American beef.
Crab cake is very nice but pricey.
Service is good.
5
Went there for my birthday dinner and have to admit they served one of the best steaks I have eaten. The food is unarguably superb and worth the price.
3
Have been going to the restaurant couple of times a year. The quality of the food is still good but noticed during our most recent visit that the service level has dropped. It is not to say that the service staffs were rude/incompetent but they are no longer as warm as the previous crew before the renovation. Maybe it was a busy Friday night with a packed restaurant
4
Although overly dark in the restaurant the menus are a sensible font-size so even a fifty year old like me can read them.....we were given a semi circular booth which gives a nice position to view the restaurant.....The wine recommendation was pretty good although pricey for a nice but standard Malbec.....the steak was great....portions too large......and I loved the brussel sprouts!Service was a little patchy. My main criticism is that the concept is rather dated......however, this is a minor point and what should I expect!

Just back from a highly disappointing experience at Morton's Singapore. Very friendly service did not make up for lack of quality of both food and wine.Drinks before dinner: Her: Whisky Sour - no egg white, but still good enough (w/Famous Grouse) . Him: Pomegranate Mojito, very nice.Starters: Her: Jumbo Shrimp Cocktail, interpretation of a shrimp cocktail with dry ice for show, not interesting. Him: 1/2 dozen oysters, fine.Mains: Her: Signature Cut Prime New York Strip, OK but not worth the price (120 S$ ++). Him: Center-Cut Prime Ribeye, only OK but no value for money at 99.50 S$ ++.Sides: Creamed spinach, more cream than spinach. Grilled Asparagus (we were not asked if we wanted it to come with balsamic vinegar, which we didn't).The worst part was the wine. A Barolo Batasiolo 2011 at 195 S$ ++. It had an awful, bitter taste with nothing to redeem it, the span of color and its depth was indicative of a very young wine. Our host himself characterized it as "stringent", which was an understatement. I came to suspect that the wine was a fake. We were offered, in a very friendly manner, two glasses of other wines, and were able to to choose from a variety that we tasted. Thinking that having sent back well over 1/2 bottle of Barolo (we, really tried to give it a chance) the two substitute glasses would be complementary, we were surprised to be charged 2x29 S$ ++.Total bill (including water, no coffee): 775.64 S$ which is frankly ridiculous.I can not recommend this place

My fiancé made a reservation a week before our visit and informed the staff that were celebrating our anniversary. He even informed the staff to write "Happy 11th Anniversary, xxx and xxx". On the day of our reservation, we arrived on time and were directed in to a table. To which 2 personalized menus had been placed on the table, to our delight. However, the menu was for another customer, it indicated "Happy Birthday, xxx." So the waiter took away and menus and told us he will come back with ours. First mistake. Why were we directed to a table that was not meant for us? The waiter took our order and told us that as we were celebrating our anniversary, there would be a complimentary chocolate lava cake for us. He came back with our menus and this time our names were printed correctly, but there was an obvious grammar error and what was printed on it differed from what my fiancé told the staff to print. It was printed "Congratulations for you wedding anniversary, Xxx and xxx." There was a grammar mistake and it's not a wedding anniversary, it's for dating anniversary. That did dampened my mood a little as we were paying for the entire dining experience and the menus will also be returned to us.We highlighted to the waiter who promptly told us they will amend and pass to us later. But he dropped another bomb by telling us that the complimentary dessert was only applicable for wedding anniversary and not dating anniversary. This time I was really disappointed because I heard so much on the signature dessert and thought that it's a wonderful gesture by the restaurant. Moreover, we were told that the dessert would be complimentary, and then it was taken away. What about the mistakes that we tolerated?Till then, the dining experience had been disappointing, though the steaks were delicious. We ordered medium rare for ribeye and New York strip. The doneness for these two steaks were not consistent but we were fine with it.The staff were courteous and helpful, but the few mistakes spoiled our anniversary dinner
5
This was my first visit to a Morton's and I wasn't disappointed, the service was first class. I ordered the 20oz New York Strip Steak with a half portion of both the Lyonnaise Potatoes and the Mushrooms with Spinach.The steak was cooked perfectly medium rare as requested and the sides went perfectly with the steak. Although very full I ordered the 'Chocolate Bomb' for desert, takes around 20 minutes to prepare but believe me if your a chocolate lover do not miss out on this one!!!!!
5
If you're looking for a budget or even mid-range meal then this isn't the place for you. However, if you're looking for fine dining with a lovely ambience and impeccable service then this is your place. The steak was absolutely amazing with delicious sauces and sides. And the key lime pie for dessert capped off one amazing meal
4
My friends and I visited Morton's Steakhouse for pre dinner drinks on 27th June. Mr. Md Noor Achang was on duty. As this was our first visit and weren't sure what to order, Mr Md Noor Achang took time to understand our preferences, explained each type of drinks and helped us picked our ideal drink. We really appreciate such customer care and support and had a enjoyable evening at Morton's. Mrs. Fong
5
What can I say?....... Delicious meat, wonderful friendly service and a comforting atmosphere. Best steak I've had so far and I have had a lot. Expensive but worth it, overall meal was top notch.
5
It's just one of those must places you should have been when u like good food and a decent atmosphere. Granted it's pricy but worth the effort. Make a reservation...
5
Ohh this place is excellent... Martini's are pure and wonderful... Apple and Vodka with olives were done to perfection. And the stake sandwiches... yumhh yummmhhhh. A must try for all.
4
Went over there for Father's Day !! Ordered the double cut tenderloin ( basically it's juz lyk normal tenderloin and upsize it) it's great to go for like a 1-time only event though.. If u r a steak lover and would like to go somewhere cheaper with the same quality of steak I recommend lawrys lunch promo... But overall great steak !! Huge sundae!!!
4
You are paying a lot for a very very good steak. This is a lovely restaurant presented in a lovely hotel. The food is of exceptional quality. The steak was of extremely good quality and cooked as requested.Although an expensive meal - it is worth it for the quality food.Wait staff are very very friendly and extremely attentive. Wait staff have a keen eye for detail and we were well looked after
5
Getting my steaks cooked to medium rare has been near impossible in Singapore. Most restaurants here end up serving it medium, which is okay but not what I want. Morton's gave me a near perfect 14oz medium rare NY strip! However, their desserts are amazing too...so having a 14oz NY Strip with a Creamed Spinach side-to-share after a lobster bisque badly affected my ability to fully appreciate the sundae. My advice, skip the starters, have an 8oz or 6oz steak (or split a 14oz or 16oz), then enjoy dessert.Red wines were good but very pricey, even by Singapore standards
2
First of all, I'm not new to this restaurant and also fine dining experiences. In fact I visit many of decent steak house and Michelin star restaurant, hence I knows the standard and what to expect when I visit this kind of place.I decide to visit Morton Singapore again to celebrate my wife Birthday which It make me regret. Get to the point, we order cold seafood platter for 2 at 90 SGD !! which in the menu, it's described of serving Alaskan King Crab, King Prawn, Lobster Tail, lumpy crab cake, sounds great right but not at all. I shocked when the platter was served, instead of a full leg of King crab, it is only one third of the whole giant leg and divided by 2 for 2 peoples !! we are talking about the same length to Iphone 6 !! This must be joking !! The Lobster tail appeared only half of the tail which they cut into 2 pieces so we have in total of 4 small pieces of Lobster !! This even worst than the normal buffet and looks at the price, it is 90 SGD or 50-60 EUR for small bit of King Crab and Lobster which it's more like left over!!The ambient, not the quiet or romantic type of restaurant but with a lot of children. Some crying, some playing... at this point, I feel more to the Chinese restaurant not the Steakhouse at Mandarin Oriental !!Only thing that I still like is their Legendary Sundae..... I will only go back for the Sundae but not for other menu...

I've been to CUT at least 5 times. Each time it was a delightful experience. I was hoping to have a similar experience and to give Morton's a try again after a bad experience with Morton's in San Fran. Made a reservation online. They sent me an email to remind me and then another call on the day itself telling me that they've 2 seating on Sunday. As my booking is at 6pm. She said at 8pm, they'll have to shift us to the bar for drinks. I hang up feeling puzzled. We ended our show early and reached Morton's wine bar at 5+. Had 2 cosmo cocktail - not impress by the taste. Probably they've 6 service staff in this small empty wine bar but we couldn't get their attention when we wanted the bill. We made our way to Morton's steak house. Their starter bread was a big lump of round bread. Uninteresting and doesn't give you that feeling of wanting to eat much of it. Chardonnay from Napa Valley was good. Couldn't understand what's 12oz in grams? asked the waiter, he told us to wait as he needs to cal. 12oz of Filet Mignon is the smallest steak you can find in the menu and it is HUGE. Can easily share with 2 person. Filet Mignon was very good - no ounce of fat and cooked to perfection. Partner's Ribeye of 16oz was disappointing. So much fat in the meat and didn't cook to what we ordered. Side dish of Spinach&mushroom and Steamed Asparagus were nice but nothing to shout about. When waiter brought out an array of dessert to view. Again the presentation was a typical mid-range American restaurant - huge and dull. We couldn't bring ourselves to order any. Overall, Morton's steak house pricing is similar to CUT yet the ambiance, waiter's knowledge, presentation, taste, the wine glasses at CUT are way superior than Morton's. Waiter who attended our table is poorly trained. He couldn't pick up that when my partner said his steak is not really done to what we ordered, he just walked away. Also told us the red wine by the glass on the list is from light to heavy? We thought was a funny way to label your wine in this manner. 1 waiter however did pick up our steak problem and waived off 2 glass of wine from our tab. We were grateful for his kind action unfortunately, I can't bring myself to be back again

Morton's is always good. But this was superlative. The food was just divine - the Australian strip particularly. And the service was so excellent, because of the personal attention given by the manager Edwin Seow. He is a total star! He has built the most fantastic team.... So ignore the expense. Eat well, live well
5
We ate here in celebration of a special birthday. Called to reserve our table and attended to by someone professional who cared about me - check. Seated at a quiet table with a personalized menu - check. Enjoyed delicious filet mignon, ribeye and NY strip w/sides of grilled asparagus, brussel sprouts and truffle fries - check. Celebrated the birthday boy with a pre-ordered chocolate souffle (on the house - nice touch) and a bottle of Shafer wine plus port - check. Nice atmosphere, got better as the evening went on. Yes, it's expensive but the food was much better and less expensive than other highly recommended steak houses in Singapore. The restaurant was packed and still excellent service and high quality of food
5
the Prime Rib was the most juicy and tender piece of meat I ever had! The service was outstanding too, very friendly and professional staff.
Morton's is not cheap, however I can confirm that it is worth every single dollar. Best steakhouse in town
4
Best steak I ever had in town..
Really love the place and it's good for the couple. Pleasant and friendly staff. Cheers guys! Highly recommended!
5
It was expensive although we were aware of that from past visits, the service was 1st class.
After dinner we had Singapore Slings in Raffles long bar to finish up a great trip to Singapore.
2
been there twice, would say the standard has dropped so much.
The place is noisy despite having to pay so much. Not worth the monies
3
Been to other Mortons and this one just not up to standard. Far too expensive and disinterested staff! Very expensive wines/drinks. That said food very good although had to sit in bar area which was very noisy.
2
Steak is not that amazing like the review - wanted to try this restaurant for a very long time but isn't that good. Price for this Isn't worth it for 2nd try!Small Birthday cake and personalist name stated on my seat menu + arranged for my birthday with photo :) great job
3
We shared a porterhouse steak (24 ounces) which was more than enough for two. Very nice t-bone cut and medium rare was cooked well. Shrimp starter was ok but almost larger than our table for 2 , which was too small. The restaurant was very very noisy and tables too close together for our liking so not an intimate meal setting in any way. Service was super efficient almost to the point of no gap between courses , which was a pity. Not sure if we will go back as our favourite steak place is cut in MBS and thus does not come close , but steak is worth trying and staff are good. Coffee was average and lukewarm

Mortonâ€™s is a classic American dining experience, serving mouth-watering prime aged beef and delicious, fresh seafood, relaxed ambiance and a tempting menu featuring grain-fed aged beef, succulent seafood and classic steakhouse dishes, also some of the most decadent desserts in Singapore. The implausible food comes at an extremely high price. Its fine dining therefore be prepared to pay a premium price for the ambiance and food. Service is excellent but it comes with a price, but what the hack you only live once

I came here for business dinner with another 2 person. The restaurant is in oriental hotel, a five star. We make a reservation before there we wait to be seated. You get the menu and they will trolley different grades of steaks to your table and you will be asked what kind of preferences you like such as wagyu, marble, Kobe etc. they have varieties from usa, Australia, Japan etc. side dishes such as fries, mash potato, vegetable need to be ordered separately. It's fine dining therefore be prepared to pay a premium price for the ambience and food. I would say the food is good and service is excellent but it comes with a price when you check your bill.

Service I have to say is still top notch. Unfortunately the 2 portions of Cajun Ribeye we ordered were too salty. It was salty to the point that it completely overpowered the beef. The crab cakes appetisers and cheese cake desert were good though. We were also disappointed to find out that corkage was $100. Overall I fell that there are many other steak houses in Singapore with better

Service 5/5
Ambience 5/5
Food 5/5
The best porter house steak that can be served, this is the place for it. Agreed that it is a bit heavy on the wallet but if you are interested in splurging, this should definitely be on the cards..
5
Better be invited to this one ;) Prices are off the roof but if you are willing to spend the amount you will not be disappointed!

I hosted a dinner to celebrate our new business venture.The evening was fabulous. The service was friendly and professional with just the right amount of attention to the guests wants and needs. The food superb. Probably the best restaurant I have been too.

+ meat was excellent: well cooked and tasty
Asparagus were amazing
Good cocktails
Nice ambiance
- service a bit too pushy
Gratin to avoid
3
No doubt about the quality of food however i am not sure about the service - took wrong order which is a big deal for me- waitress wasn't serious enough - she took order without writing them down - hence we got wrong food
5
Came here for my birthday, staff were very well trained and accommodating. They took took our picture and gave us a nice personalized card for the occasion! Came with a free portion of cake as well. We went for the steak and seafood offer (not on the menu, needs to be asked for) but total bill was still S$500! Overall was very pleased with the steak and the crab cakes were the best I've had, you can really taste the fresh crab mea

Morton's is incredible, a classic American steakhouse experience, offering the finest beef in sumptuous surroundings, with shag pile carpets, waiters in formal garb and period piece light fittings. Starched white linen, heavy silverware and beautiful oversize wine glasses all make for a luxurious dinner. Predictably, the waiters have all memorised the specials (as in any self respecting high end Yankee joint) and pour out all the spiel with excessive adjectives in a completely unnecessary manner. My meal was one of the best this year. I went for the mixed grill for $98. The scallops wrapped in bacon were incredible, so tasty and perfectly cooked, the bacon salty and crisp. The prawns were large and juicy, but the steak? Out of this world! The shoestring truffle fries and grilled asparagus perfectly complimented the meat and the French Bordeaux washed it down well.Dessert was interesting - massive portions and not actually like the samples that the waiter brought to the table. I had the plump and juicy raspberries served on a bed of whipped cream and half the soft and velvety cheesecake, which was too large for one of my neighbours and would be enough to feed a small family.Given how successful and prominent Morten's is, the fact that the hotel has chosen to hide it away beside the rather mid market World cafe is pretty bizarre - and the so-called Bar at Morten's is not actually beside the steakhouse. Once you have found Morten's, however, make sure you have plenty of dollars, as the incredible food comes at an incredibly high price. $22 for a portion of perfect truffle oil drizzled and Parmesan sprinkled chips? Worth it at Morten's
2
We asked for medium ... But after about 45 mins the steaks and both were overdone. One was salty. Not sure why. There must be big issues Staff were apologetic and helpful. They tried hard to make it up. But we came to this overpriced restaurant for good steak, not apologies, and didn't get it. So FAIL
5
This was our second visit to Mortons in Singapore, first visit was 4 years ago, and it is still the best steak I have ever had, anywhere. I just can't put into words just how good the food and service is in this restaurant. The scallops are to die for but the steak just oh its just brilliant. We ended the meal with a souffle and oh again, just devine. Go there, spend the money and just enjoy
5
I was not sure what to expect when i dined at Mortons. i was searching for a special place for my Valentine date and came across Mortons for their Steak and hot choco cake.We were a little early but we were warmly welcomed by staff and brought to our table near the bar. We were then introduced to the menu by the waiter, by the name of Shaun, who clearly detailed the specialties of the place. Clearly he knew the menu rather extensively and was a very inter-active person.Kudos to him for actually going out of the by to help us to snap a picture for us and to instruct the cook to have the steak cut into two for us without any instructions from us.The servings for the meals and side dishes were extremely generous. Clearly a table of two had trouble trying to finish them. Steak was very succulent as well and their legendary hot choco lava cake was actually very favorable (this is coming from a person who dislikes choco)We were extremely satisfied with the food , atmosphere and Service (once again kudos to Shaun, our professional waiter) and we look forward to coming back soon :

Morton's is one of my favourite restaurant in singapore for special occasions. Food and Steaks are very good, cooked to perfection, pricey but worth it. Wine list quiet extensive, i always opt for italian wines being from Milan. Staff and management extremely attentive.
5
my family and i went to Mortons for the first time a few years ago, and now every time we visit singapore we always eat here! the steak is absolutely delicious and tender, by far the best steak i, or my family have ever had! the bar is also lovely and quiet. There are different side dishes, but we always order the cream spinach and butter mushrooms, which are perfect. Definitely if you are in singapore you must come here one night
1
Had booked a table. Were welcomed by the hostess, who followed us to the table in the middle of the restaurant. Thereafter nothing happened at all, even though a lot of waiters were passing by in a hurry. The restaurant was almost chaotic. After 10 minutes without service - not even the menu - we left in anger. Went to Ruth Chris Steakhouse where we had an excellent service
4
We called for a table at 9pm on a Thursday night, which was perfect for us; when we arrived the place was packed but the crowd did thin out. Unfortunately there is very little in the way of sound absorption and of course anybody who was anybody was there, and they liked to shout about it.The staff were a delight, very accommodating, we found them very entertaining and wonderful hosts. 10/10 here.The wine list is a dream. We shared the Australian 24oz steak, and I must say it can only be beaten by one or two other steakhouses I've visited, in Bangkok and Hong Kong. We took a chocolate mousse and a side of raspberries - delicious. The presentation and attention to detail is on point.Overall, the only improvement could be made on the decor. It lacked a feeling of intimacy for me, which I would expect to find for the price, even for a chain steakhouse in Singapore.
5
It was my wife's birthday so I made a booking at Morton's. We had been there a few years before for my birthday so knew that the food would be good.The service was excellent, waiter (Shaun) presented the specials in such a way I could remember them all! The wine was nice and cold. Overall service was exceptional.The food was outstanding. My steak cooked to perfection, as was my wife's steak.Desert was on the house for her birthday. Also excellent and more than enough for us to share.It is pricey but well worth it
3
Now, lets see, when you sit down they give you a cob of warm bread, which you try to cut and butter with a steak knife-where is the logic there??? I didn't like the taste of the bread I thought it was very dry but that's personal.We ordered 3 Filet Mignon 6oz steaks, 2 sides, 2 glasses of red wine and one chocolate mousse, over $450.00 Honestly!!!!! Good steaks, yes, but!?We travel the world and have eaten in many Steak Restaurants, the steaks, were good, service ok, ambience average.Would we return, defiantly NOT!!
5
Steaks are cooked perfectly but very expensive - S$80 - $120 with side dishes extra - S$22-24. Excellent service and great desserts. The largest raspberry soufflé I have seen - our waitress did warn me so my husband had to help me eat it. Really delicious; I love soufflé and this was one of the best.
5
The dinner my family and I had at Morton's was delicious. I'm not one for franchise restaurants, but this steak house was definitely the best in Singapore and better than most I've had in the states. I've been to the Morton's in Houston and in Scottsdale. They aren't even close to this one. My family and I would say this is probably the #3 or 4 best meal we've had.The steaks were very flavorful and the sides were delicious. The creme brulee I thought was just ok. If you just happen to be in the area, go, you won't be disappointed. It is an easy walk from the Marina Bay Sands hotel
3
The restaurant is dimly litted and is crowded best is make a reservation.The steaks here are expensive so I expect it to be succulent and palatable. The seafood platter has quite a variety which we chose as appetiser. We spent over $300 .... Overall it didn't impress me with so much talk of Morton - the Steak Place
3
Celebrated my daughter's 18th birthday. She is a steak lover and I have been told that Morton's serves one of the best. The place was okay. the service was acceptable.But our purpose of our visit was to savour the steak and I have to say that while the fillet mignon was excellent, the rest of the meal was rather forgettable. And the birthday girl's verdict? - She shrugged her shoulders and said 'Yeah, it was okay'. Which was rather disappointing after spending about S$100 per person (without wine).And I can think of a few other restaurants here that served better for less
4
the steak is best which i celebrate my birthday with my whole family there for pass years. remember to reserve table they are quite full during weekend.
3
Great atmosphere for a private date. Very good presentation for the food selections. However, the steaks are priced at market rate for a very good steak, but when you total up the steak with the sides; overpriced..
4
If you are in the mood for a great steak and don't object to top end prices....then Morton's might be for you. The wine list is delightful, the food is presented well and the sides are fabulous, the French onion soup is superb. The waitress brings you a hot homebaked bread with really lovely butter to start with. The atmosphere a bit noisy and cramped. The interiors are dated with strange music. But if you purely are in the mood for good food. ..This place is the right one. Set at the Mandarin Oriental hotel in Singapore's business district it is easy to get to with ample car parking and public transport options. Good food at high end prices is what you have bargained for.

We went to Morton's during our 40th wedding anniversary trip to Singapore and dined there on Christmas day. The food was excellent--some of the best steaks we ever had--but the service put this experience right over the top. Everyone on staff was attentive without being smothering. We were made to feel truly welcome, and when we mentioned that it was an anniversary trip, even though it was NOT the actual date of our anniversary, we received special treatment that was heartwarming and unexpected. Not only were we treated to dessert but were offered comped after dinner drinks. Alas, are were too (happily!) full to accept. And this was topped by receiving souvenir menus with a Happy Anniversary message.The manager of Morton's came to our table and was charming. The staff took perfect care of us, especially vital because my husband has a severe food allergy. The treatment we received here was one reason we've stopped thinking of our Singapore trip as "once in a lifetime" and have begun planning our return.For excellent food and beyond excellent service, I highly recommend Morton's
3
I have given this a 3. Should it be a 3. Probably not on a good day, but this evening was a disaster. My guests all love a good steak when they come to town & so we thought we would try Mortons given the reputation. Very disappointing !The first steak we sent back which I had never seen done before in my company. The second came back & it was badly cooked & still cold in the middle. The staff were great, I can't complain there, the product & price though was very disappointing. I won't go back & don't think my dinner dates will either.

I'm sad to write this as Morton's used to be one of our go-to, celebration restaurants.So it's with a heavy heart that I bid this restaurant good bye. Why?During our last visit in December I was appalled 1. restaurant had been renovated to squeeze in another private dining room, round tables squashed in to offer more covers and some of the booths removed. Bye bye the luxury and clubby atmosphere with attention service. Poor service staff were tripping up over themselves having to serve more tables which were tightly crammed together.2. to get food poisoning here! I suspect it was the lime margarita (the worst I've ever been served by a bar - in a white wine glass for goodness sake!) Our waiter Jerry did the best he could and got it changed, but still I didn't finish it. IS it possible to contract food poisoning from one drink???OR the culprit was the "a la Oscar" sauce that I ordered with my steak (creamy sauce with crab bits) as they were the only two items none of the other diners shared.3. because I did write to Morton's the next day to alert them of my poor experience, but no reply after over a week.....$580 for 3 pax with one beer, two soft drinks and one dodgy Margarita
3
We had delicious steaks - not the best we'd ever had , I mught add, and then got the bill. Very expensive which left us feeling wuite stung! Most people like steak and chips but do they have to add truffles and Parmesan cheese to them to make them unbearably rich!
4
2nd Visit this year last time was not good pleased to say this time round food and service were much better and we all enjoyed a great meal. Service was attentive and done with a no rush attitude.. Back to its best proved my last visit was just a one of. Its not cheap but you get what you pay for
5
The last time I've been here was more than 10 years ago. Entered the restaurant and did realise the tables are close to each other. Luckily we had a side table that was not in the middle of the roomWe started with a Caesar salad and shared that, the portion is large. Then I had the smallest steak on the menu, the 6oz filet mignon. My friend has the 8oz. Both were excellently cooked and of good quality. The red chianti we had was $25 a glass. Overpriced. Then the dessert menu came, which was basically almost all the desserts on a tray. Strangely there was no Molton lava cake on the tray, and no mention of it. I knew this was their special and so asked for it. The cake was ok. We had an Australian dessert wine that was $30 a glass. Overpriced againAll in all, a good meal with good service, but the wine prices are such a turnoff, though I suppose it's quite normal in Singapore
3
Always loved the happy hour at Mortons - $10 cocktails and free steak sandwiches but our recent visit was a disappointment.Slow service, had to constantly ask for a "free steak sandwich" - two rounds in two hours :( but it was a just a noisy, ordinary bar when it used to be so special.Think the Mandarin Oriental now resting on it's laurels - it used to be one of the few places to offer value for money and the free sandwiches were free flow and delicious. There are lots of places that now do canapes and half price drinks so in the future I think we'll probably try one of those
5
I recently walked intoThe Mandarin Oriental Hotel to take a look on an afternoon off and found Morton's The Bar and Morton's The Steakhouse. My wife had raved about their restaurant in Cleveland so I stopped into the bar intending to have a drink and perhaps something from the bar menu. While having my drink a waitress served little steak sandwich appetizers. The steak tasted so good I decided to go the the dining room for dinner. I ordered a medium rare fillet and spinach salad. A crusty loaf of bread arrived just before a good glass of the recommended cabernet. The steak was cooked perfectly, tasty, and very tender. The salad was a surprise in that the dressing had an herb I couldn't identify but the effect was excellent.Service was attentive but not intrusive. The menu is expensive but this is Singapore and was worth the splurge to me
5
Near perfect combination of incredible food, a comprehensive wine selection, and great service. By far one of the best stake houses in Asia and I have been to many. A bit on the pricy side, but if you appreciate a fine dining experience well worth it.
2
This used to be my favourite restaurant in Singapore but I don't know what has happened to this iconic restaurant. The starters this evening were dry; the seafood was limp and pathetic and the bill was completely astronomical compared with the value for money. The main course steak however, was good. Would I go back for another business dinner, was it value for money? Nope. Pity
5
Morton's steakhouse is in Mandarin Hotel level 4. There was a bit of renovation going on when we ate there, so the entrance to the restaurant was hard to find. We ordered a medium filet mignon and medium rare NY strip with sides. Both were cooked perfectly. We had Morton's salad, crab soup and fries for sides. The salad was ok, soup was too salty for our taste. Coffee and tea is free!The servers and hosts were very attentive, considering the house was almost full. It's a bit pricey, but that's expected for a hotel restaurant. The 4 of us spent $600 for 2 double-portion steaks with sides, a soda, 2 desserts and a cheap bottle of wine. Call in advance for a reservation, if possible. We called and told them we were celebrating a birthday, so they personalized our menus and decorated our table a bit. They gave our friend a free molten lava cake, too! They took a photo of us and printed it on a card, which they gave to us as a remembrance for that night. Overall, it was a wonderful treat! It's something we would consider again for special occasions.
2
The restaurant was recommended by a five star hotel when asked for the best beef in town .... First experience with Mortons. The beef 's quality is indeed interesting but the service is clearly not good at all for what can be expected in this category of restaurant. Just an example or two. We all ordered beef and while we were waiting for our meal there was a large fresh bread brought to our table together with butter. There was no cutlery for butter. So we had to use our "huge" steak knife for the bread and butter. Second and much more unacceptable. We ordered some expensive French wine. When we were served the second bottle they just poured it immediately in the same glasses without hesitation. They didn't change the wine glasses and just filled the glasses, mixing two wines from two different bottles. This is just unacceptable and especially in this category of restaurant. And with pricey wines. Besides these "mistakes", the beef is indeed good and tender but the side dishes could be much better, especially the French fries that are not at the same quality level as the meat. Same remark for the sauces that are just basic industrial mustard and ketchup. It would be better to have a real "bÃ©arnaise" or "fresh green pepper sauce" for instance. And finally, to end up with the service, we were told to wait for our table when many tables were free. The occupancy rate was basically 60 to 70% and however they continued answering over the phone that they had no availabilities and that the customers had to wait for a table. Which is just amazing since there were available tables all around. As a conclusion this restaurant should urgently receive some attention from the management since it seems quite badly managed at the moment.
5
Morton's steak house is tucked away on the 4th level of the Mandarin Oriental Hotel and offers an elegant and tranquil setting for that special dining experience. Service is attentive with out being transatlantically familiar. Steaks are the speciality and there is a wide range from which to chose. The desert menu is limited but, on relfelction, this is wise as those on offer are delicious and well presented. Morton's is expensive and a touch over-priced. Nevertheless, for those who want a memorable dining experience in Singapore, this restaurant offers style, quality and, above all, and excellent menu
3
7:30 pm on a Friday meet at the bar and then 8:30 pm dinner. Not bad so far but 2 (7 total in group with reservations) had to sit on foot stools. Not comfortable at all. Wine was served correctly but the Jack and coke was nothing but crushed ice and max coke. I had asked for only 2cubes of ice...oh well. Dinner was overall pretty good. As an American bragging about a Chicago steakhouse, it was tough to walk into a scene with renovation going on. No worries as that happens but....Appetizers were terrific as how can you go wrong with their oysters and the Rockefeller ones.Dinner was superb as grain fed US steaks are the swizzle. The sides were terrific and made to be shared with at least 3 others so do not be put off by the high price of sides.To the disappointing,,,,we wanted the prime rib but were told that only medium was left was a disappointment. I know something about prepping this meat but to only have medium left at 0830 on a Friday night....not good. The good news was the US ribeye more than made up for it. The filet mignon for a first time US steak eater (our Belgian friend) was a huge success. Bad point....the stuffed shrimp bombed...not the stuffing but the "cookedness" of the shrimp was poor. If we want our stuffed shrimp baked with stuffing, it oughta be cooked thoroughly. Didn't happen and my Louisiana wife wasn't too keen on that.Dessert wasn't bad as the brulet was a hit. Having spent a large time of our lives in the Fl. keys, we love Key Lime Pie and while it wasn't what we have had in Turtle Kraals in KW, this was very good and the crust is unlike I have ever had and it is truly world class. Nice job pastry folks!All in all, good experience with a few exceptions. Simply put, if you want a real US steak, don't mind the price and for now, overlook the renovations, it's worth the trip, hands down
5
This was our first experience with Mortons and it really did live up to our high expectations. From the friendly service in the bar to the fabulous dining experience in the restaurant I'm not sure where to start. The serving sizes are very large so be prepared to share some dishes if you are not a big eater. We started with oysters and the crab cakes which were fabulous and then each had the filet mignon, it comes by the gram and we had the smallest which I think was about 170g so perfect for 2 streak loving ladies. Wine selection one of the best I've seen altho we did have a chuckle over the Cloudy Bay Sav Blanc at $170 which retails in Australia between $20-$25 a bottle. We opted for a Napa Valley red. Sommelier was excellent. Never felt rushed and meals came out timed to perfection. Thought it was a lovely touch when our waiter asked if we wanted a photo together. All in all you won't have a bad experience here, but be prepared to pay for it
4
True steak house with the whole package: baked potatoes, french fries, all the classy sauce.The filet mignon is top so is the prime rib eye. Quality meat cooked to perfection.Service is fast and efficient.Prices ok for SingaporeNice location in the Mandarin Hote
4
It was a really good meal - the steak was almost as good as in the US, and I thought the vegetables were actually better in some ways. The only complaint is the price. It's about double what you would pay for an identical meal in the US at the same restaurant chain
3
As I said, it's a nice place to dine in. Great quality of food and drinks. Service is fabulous. What I like most about this place is the portion size!
Will I come back?
YES
5
Unbelievably good crab cakes, shrimp and fillet steak with mac n cheese and onion rings in the side. Definitely one for the list if you want an alternative to Cantonese food for one evening.
4
Was having a business dinner there and the quality is very high - super meat, nice sides and cool selection of mustards etc.The staff is also cool, but some of them lack the knowledge to match the pricetag. I asked for recommendation between two Italian wines, and the reply was that I should go for the highest priced bottle, as that was a quality indicator???If you want cool atmosphere, nice meat and a good selection of wines - then you should visit Mortons..
3
Although the menu and quality remains pretty much the same - which means of good quality, the service has dropped. If one had to pour one's own carafe of wine, that sums it up. The Bar which is located outside the restaurant deserves a mention. The quality of drinks is good. The complimentary steak sandwiches between 5-7pm is a stand out as the quality is very good. But the place can be packed and the quality of the crowd although "international" lowers to that of a plebeian pub in the east end of London. It's not acceptable within the confines of the Mandarin Oriental. The management must be strong enough to ask such rowdy patrons TO LEAVE
5
Mortons is inside the Mandarin Oriental and maintaind she same quality as on the chain's other steakhouses in e.g. New York and Houston. Good for business dining, expensive of course but as always delivers service and top quality.This Place seems always to be full so make reservations if you can, if not it is not a bad idea to waut 30 min over cocktails in the nearby bar
5
Morton's never fails you when it comes to both their food and service. They had recently renovated and I personally feel its a lot more classy than the previous decor. Ambience is lovely and they now have private rooms for business dinners. I'm always at Morton's for occasions-birthdays, Christmas and whatever occasion that you want to celebrate! When making reservations, always ask for the booth seats, it's a lot more comfortable. I had the centre cut prime rib and it was awesome! It wasn't too fatty nor was it too lean. Ask for medium plus which meant that it's in between of medium rare and medium well! It was lovely! We also ordered the oysters (Canadian) and it was great on its own without any condiments. The scallop wrapped with bacon was to die for-the bacon was crispy and scallop was cooked to perfection! The onion rings was one of its kind-I'm not a big fan but was certainly converted! The batter was crispy and it certainly did not fail. I think you can never go wrong with the good there! It's insanely wonderful! Do keep room for desserts-loved the chocolate mousse, key lime pie too. We had one of the best server-ADA who was witty and certainly attention to details when serving you! Overall, we had such a wonderful time at Morton's yet again and look forward to returning again in the near future! Would certainly recommend this place for all occasions or even if you just feel like having a great steak
4
The husband brought me here for a special evening without our kids. It was a lovely corner seating with confetti on the table. The fillet mignon is excellent if u like lean and tender steak. Must try the lobster bisque and sautÃ©ed spinach and mushrooms. We enjoyed the warm service. There was complimentary dessert for me and I enjoyed the key lime pie very much. What made is special was the service and a lovely hand written photo card of the evening. The manager even went to each table to ask about the food. Will love to be back here for another special event
5
We went in a large group during the F1 weekend and whilst very busy still very attentive service , from the knowledgable staff. Many guests had previously been to this restaurant as they are living locally so regular customers of Mortons. I found the food to be very good quality and the steaks were high quality and cooked to perfection. I am a very fussy streak eater and was impressed. They even had chilled champagne which is a rare find in Singapore, even when it's French vintage, so that received a big tick from me!Boisterous kind of atmosphere that night so was a fun night we all enjoyed and will return next time in Singapore.
3
Morton's steakhouse used one of the must visit restaurants for me every time I was in Singapore, but over the years the experience has deteriorated. The Food is still good, but not exceptional, and the atmosphere doesn't feel as high class. can't blame the management for cramming in as many tables as they can, but it's come at a cost to the overall quality... though the chocolate lava cake is still a dream : 
5
We have visited Morton's on several occasions. The food and service has always been top class. It is a kid friendly restaurant but most of all the chocolate lava cake is to die for! Whilst the price is on the higher end of the scale, their food portions are quite generous
2
Reservation easily made & seated me on arrival. Noisy & tables sort of cramped together. Music way too loud. The bread was hard, difficult to cut & makes a mess. I opted for 14 oz Strip medium rare --cooked perfectly, but at least 2 ounces of fat, which is not pleasing @ SGD 120 for a steak. I tried steak fries--they had an "off" taste--maybe worn out oil? Sent those back & tried half order of Asparagus--not much better--not really green or fresh. Service OK--head man attentive; but for the price, I expected a LOT better
4
This is my third review of Mortons and we keep them as a special treat for us.We visited them tonight, as it is our final night in Singapore, after 6 years living here.I had the lamb chops, my son the fillet mignon and my wife the veal. We followed these with the Gran Marnier souffle and the Hot Chocolate Cake.Firstly, the lady who called me to confirm the 7pm reservation set the evening off to a bad tone by asking me to note 'there is a second seating at 9pm'. For a restaurant expecting to charge me North of S$400, that is completely unacceptable.Then, when we arrived, my son immediately noticed his spoon was dirty. Not 'small smudge' dirty but small lump of food dirty. When we pointed this out to the waiter, it was grudgingly replaced. No apology.Final error was my wife asked for a medium-rare veal chop. It took 15 - 20 minutes to cook and arrived looking more on the rare end of the spectrum but was completely uncooked and cold in the centre. This compared badly with my medium-rare lamb chops and my son's medium-rare filet, which were perfectly cooked and red and warm in the centre. Given most of the waiters go to lengths to explain what the difference is between rare, medium rare and medium; this was very surprising.However, I have to admit, even with these 3 errors, the remainder of the food was excellent and, once corrected, we enjoyed everything.Morton's remains one of our favourite restaurants in Singapore but, at $534 for the bill and on our last night, we felt rushed and expect better than we got tonight
2
We chose this place for a last night in Singapore for my wife. With that price tag, we were expecting to have an enjoyable meal. Steak was good for sure but the question is their service. They throw a plate when I asked for one. Cold and hard bread. Kids are screaming and running around... I guess this is Singapore... Although we didn't voice out our frustration, we were lucky to be spotted by the American manager who moved our table to quiet corner and obviously talked to the team. Then the whole service changed! even the waiter who throw the plate to us earlier were smiling.... Im confident this restaurant can lift themselves to higher reputation but training is needed urgently
3
Disappointing experience when I made a reservation which was turned down for overbooking reasons in the main dining room and I ended up settling for a seat at the bar... The worst part was that tables were still available 2 hours after I had finished dining. unfortunately, VIP status was ignored and obviously a staff lacking training did not even apologize, nor did the restaurant manager showed up with an explanation.

Absolutely consistent with one’s expectations with the attention from management exceeding expectations in terms of taking care of the slightest request. Never inexpensive but you know that before you go. A little challenging to find if it is your first visit but for the right occasion Morton’s delivers. A very successful and enjoyable evening

Morton's never disappoints.It's our special occassion place we go to and have been left feeling very impressed each time.Highly recommend the tenderloin, asparagus and molten choc cake! Service is impeccable and they even made me feel as comfy as possible as I was heavily pregnant. The staff were attentive and even offered suggestions when I could not decide on the menu.Atmosphere is cosy and be sure to inform them if ure having a special occassion when making reservations. They will customise the menu for you! Can't recommend this place enough and will definitely return again

Morton's is not the place to bring your vegetarian friends.... Only meat lovers.Yet again, tried not long ago, and the quality of their steak is amazing. Perfectly cooked as we requested medium rare, tender, hot and juicy and a great taste. Few places are able to compete with them, a lot tried but failed....Service is good and attentive.Was not impressed by their appetizers, but the fact is, you are not going in a Steak House to eat green salad!A bit sad they stopped doing the meat trolley, which was a part of the show, but overall, the meat quality is there... at a price.For the wine list, it is pricey, but nice selection

We went there to celebrate my husband's Birthday in Singapore. They had the table designed and made us special menu to the occasion, and even made us a Birthday card at the end of the night with our photo :)My husband enjoyed his Birthday, and we had a great steak there. It is overpriced, but I guess for the pleasure you get it is worth to celebrate special occasions like that

You don't go to a Morton's without knowing you're going to drop a few bills and this is especially true here in Singapore. That being said, while it is expensive the food and service was typically outstanding. To the details...the crab cake appetizer was as good as it is anywhere in the US and the raw oysters had a nice local touch in their saltiness unlike what we experience in the US. The prosciutto wrapped mozzarella was a huge disappointment. The steaks were what I would expect of Mortons in that the quality was top notch. The staff cooked them exactly how they were ordered and the sides, spinach/mushrooms and asparagus were first class. In retrospect, this is an ideal place for a US expat to celebrate an occasion that connects them to home or someone that just wants to have a really good cut of meat but as said earlier, be ready to spend the $$

I had my birthday dinner at Morton's and it was one of the best dinner i ever had in my life! My friend and I had Seafood Platter and shared Rip eye steak. Oysters, lobster, and everything was so fresh and delicious, steak was also really delicious and it was just perfect. They offered all kinds of dessert after the meal, and even printed custom printed menu for me! Service was exceptional and it was a perfect birthday celebration. It isn't easy to find good quality restaurants in Singapore, but I am glad that I have found one. I would definitely go back for that steak and seafood
4
The title says it all. Everything you expect of Mortons is here, just at Singapore prices. Don't be put off, we've come back several times so they are doing something right. Steak is great, as always.

Much more pricy and the quality of the food is left to be desired. I am a regular at Morton's and you can give this a miss if you are in Singapore
5
This is the best Morton's I have been to in my life! I am a huge Morton's fan but this one is above all the best tasting of them all. I ate here twice, the first time I had the fillet which I recommend above all. the second time they had a special, a fillet with a lobster tail. Both are equally amazing! the Spinach is a great appetizer but remember, their starters are good for two people. Make sure you go there hungry!!
5
First of all, the crab cakes were absolutely delicious and set the standard for the rest of the dinner. The steaks were of course fabulous but I tried the barramundi this time round and the sauce was awesome and blended well with the fish. My family enjoyed this occasion which happened to be my wife's birthday

Food in "good" restaurants in Singapore is expensive. For the last dinner at that trip i decided to visit Mortons since i wanted a nice steak before the way back to Europe.We ordered Alaska crab legs which i love and t bone stakes that were ok. They brought us some onion bread that didnt order but was later charged. The crab legs at the menu where desrcibed as market priced (never comunicated the price) but we assumed that where fresh so that was the reason.Market means fresh thus the changing price) But not! i have eaten fresh crab legs and i know the diffrence 100%. That ones was frozen and the worce part is that they used voric acid that has laxative efects.( keeps the natural colour in shrimps and crabsMyself and my parter who is a chemist and knows about these things had severe diarea that lasted for hours within 45 minutes leaving the restaurant and before boarding for a long hall flight... Fantastic...The dinner with a bottle of moderate priced wine costed 250 euros which is a rip off even in Singapore. We wrote a letter with all the details to the management bun nobody bothered to answer. If I had free time i would made a formal accusation to the health authorities but mentioning this to other travelers hopefully will do the job..
1
Had to ask 4 times for the menu. Had to ask 3 times for the wine that had been ordered. Had to ask twice for the food. Had to ask 4 times for the bill. Waiters and the general manager walked around a lot but ignored us when we tried to get their attention
4
Liked the food great steak but not so sure the staff were as switched on as they should be,, they got my guests steak's cooked the wrong way round, They did re do but by then i had finished and the sides were getting cold. We got a complimentry side nice touch but must say we had to do a lot of chasing of the staff to get things done ,,

Most of the below review are true - this probably is the best steakhouse in Singapore (more on that later if you want detail) - so assume that is a given. I'll tell you about PRICE, service and ambiance instead... I get the impression this place/hotel is after Corporate account free-spenders with Amex cards, not couples/families looking for a nice upmarket meal. It didn't seem like the servers were using the meat trolley anymore either. Anyway, you can decide the following prices are worth it:- Pre-drinks, about US$15 for a house pour (Jim Beam etc) and US$25 for a Martini- Steak prices start around USD$90-100 (again, the steaks are excellent), before sides- I don't recall any wines below USD$110 (although the wine list is excellent)- Sides (fries, mac/cheese, salad etc) robbery between US$20-25 each! Personally, I drew the line on the SG$24 Caesar Salad - which was just lettuce, some cheese and two croutons. That dish must be one million percentage mark-up it's actually an embarrassment for the management. If you are going to charge that at least follow the standard recipe with bacon, egg, anchovies and cherry tomatoes - and make it organic whilst your at it... I don't think I've ever complained in a restaurant (especially since this was date night) but I calmly mentioned it and the server/managers regained my happiness instantly with a polite explanation and an after-dinner drinks. Very well done, true professionals for having the tact to recover the experience. THANK YOU. I wish I had recalled their names so I could write so here, as well So... Including Tax and Tip: 2 drinks, no starters, 2 steaks, 2 sides, 1 bottle of lower-end wine and 1 dessert to share was US$500!!!... It was a very good dinner indeed. So let's compare:1. Again, the service was outstanding as was the meal. It's a cosy, old-school ambiance and they really do find a way to make you relax and enjoy the experience. Top marks for service and style2. "Cut" is competitive to this place in terms of price but offers a more designer/stylish ambiance - maybe a younger crowd, but definitely not a place for families (young or old)3. "Ruth Chris" seemed nearly identical to me, but the steak not quite as good since it's served on a hot plate that continues to cook your steak. Therefore having it rare is not much an option4. Both "Woolloomoolloo" and "Le Bouchon" are a good substitutes for the above, it'll easily be 40-50% cheaper and nearly as good in most areas consideredWill I be back? Probably yes, but not as a regular. The Singapore steakhouse market has expanded to many other options in the last 2 years and Mortons seems at a tipping point now due to price - surely people will think about going elsewhere
5
Have dined here multiple times over the last 5 years. Each time, the food does not disappoint. Great steaks and top notch service. They even commemorate your special occasions with personalized menus and greetings. Yes, it is pricey, but the portions are big too so you don't feel ripped off. I would rate this as value for money. Probably the best steakhouse in Singapore
5
I was there to ring inmy birthday, the food was awesomeeee. Don't think I've had better rib eye steak EVER! every bite just melts in the mouth and the portions are huge too! The stsrters are delicious though the menu is not very extensive, food certainly is marvellous.The staff there is excellent they pay utmost attention to each table! On reaching there I found a customized menuon the table wishing me happy birthday and later a card with one of the pics they took!!they surely know how to make specialoccasions more special :) guys this is the place to take your loved one to for an amazing & memorable time
5
Went many items with friends who like meat. This place is one of the best for steaks and the wine menu is big. Service as perfect as the food.
4
The simple advice here is try it and see! Ok the prices are high but so is the standard. Not full marls yet as the staff could be better but then steaks are sublime.
5
I really enjoyed my meal here. The service was to-die-for, even by local standards. Steak was perfect. 5 stars.
5
had dinner with my girl on my last day in Singapore. Ordered the steak and it's top notch. It's tender, juicy and cook perfectly. The service's so good and friendly. The staffs look after at their guests.

I am not ashamed to say that this is my first time at Morton's Steakhouse, despite their legendary status among my beef-oholic friends. Their price tag is also equally legendary.Excited yet apprehensive about the quality of the steak and the size of the hole it will burn in my pocket, I accepted my partner's invitation to have dinner with him at Morton's.A few things sorely lacking in most F&B establishments in Singapore is the quality of service provided. At Morton's, you can expect the best, personalised service ever (Well, comparable to Black Swan, I would say).Stepping foot into Mandarin Oriental (Morton's is at Level 4), I gave 2 thumbs up to the antiquated-like settings with deep maroon and brass finishing. Somehow in my mind's eye, I always have this vision that good steakhouses will have these kind of furnishings. Anyway, I digress.The two waitresses greeted me with a warm smile and without hesitation I mentioned that my friend is already inside. To which, they confirmed my friend's name and one of them walked me to my table. The self-independent woman in me wanted to decline for her to walk me to my table but she was walking too purposefully for me to stop her. I spotted my partner in one the booths and he gave me a mischievous smile. We reached the table and next thing I knew, the waitress pull out the table with effortless Herculean strength to let me in. Wow. I guess this is part of their service to diners who sit at the booths which I feel was adequate for one person to slide in, slowly.Having checked out their menu online, I was still undecided on what to order so we decided to seek the recommendations of our waiter. He gamely and cheerfully recommended me a Center-Cut Fillet Mignon 8oz as he felt that the 12oz onwards would be too huge for me - if only he knew of my appetite for beef, having ate 2 Jack's Place steak in one sitting! For my partner, he recommended the Chilean Seabass Fillet a La Nage. We ordered the cream spinach after our waiter commented that the sauteed spinach and mushrooms are meh.The crowd was picking up by that time and I was impressed when our food came in record time. Verdict:1. Center-Cut Fillet Mignon - I was singing praises with every gentle slice of beef that I savoured - "Wow, very soft, melts in your mouth. This is good." - to the point my partner was highly amused. The 8oz would be more than sufficient to most ladies, but not to me. Almost to the point where I was tempted to order another one! Served simply on a white plate, the steak oozed flavourful spoonfuls of beef juice!2. Creamed Spinach - The dish looks overwhelming at first sight but it goes well with my steak as I had no sides on my plate. The delicious butter-filled aroma that it exudes is simply appetizing. Though it is 'creamed', it is light and easy on the palette.3. Chilean Seabass Fillet a La Nage - Fresh, that's one word to describe the fish. The portion is somewhat larger then what most steakhouses would serve but we are not complaining. The sauce may seem a bit too light for those who are used to creamy, buttery sauce but I feel that it acts as an excellent foil to bring out the freshness of the fish. 4. Key Lime Pie - This tops my list as the best ever, dethroning the Key Lime Pie at PS Cafe. Light and tangy with just the right amount of sweetness, this is a good choice for a desert. Best savoured with after-dinner tea (without milk).The manager stopped by our table to chat and check on our satisfaction and though I usually dislike chatting with the staff during my meal, I was infected by his good sense of humor and charm.Would I return again? Hell, yes! On special occasions though..Service: 5/5Humor of staff 6/5Food: 5/5Price: 3/5 (only because it would burn a huge hole in your pocket if you start craving for the Fillet Mignon 8oz every two weeks!

Checking out for a good steak in Singapore, Morton came highly recommended so I thought, why not try? My expectations where there already but this place exceeded it by a mile! My plane arrived late so I thought I was going to miss my booking but Morton call just as I finished checking-in showed a great care because my experience with restaurants are they do not call to check on booking. I went straight to the restaurant reaching about 10.20... kitchen closes at 10.30. We were guided to a booth table and, get this, they pulled the whole table out so that I did not need to slide into the table. The complimentary bun was quite big but the butter was heavenly. My tuna tower hit all the rights nodes and demonstrated balance of taste excellently. But the creme de la creme is ofcourse the steak itself. I had a prime rib eye and it was cooked to perfection. Tender, juicy with slight crust on the outside... one of the best steak (if not, THE BEST) steak I've had. Well done

Wanted meat.. Badly! Was my 4 time to Mortons over a few years period. When ordering, asked for the usual presentation of their cuts, but was advised that they don't do that anymore. Was a bit disappointed as that is one of the parts I liked, as I never remember the sizes. Ordered a New York strip and it was nicely cooked medium rare. Probably should have tried the filet minion as didn't find it particularly tender. Been to Mortons quite a few times and not only in Singapore, but left with a feeling that I don't really need to come there sometime soon again. Price and quality and total feel, just didn't work this time.
2
Disappointing in all means: Table not ready although reserved, took 1 hour to get the food, and once we got it, it was not served at the same time for all the participants at the table. 2 out of 5 meals were not as ordered. They took it back, put it under the "heater" (including the salad) and brought if back after a few minutes. The meal was perfect after that but the plate looked like a "dead garden". The service was ok but didn't care so much. The chef de service was there when we came but then disappeared and only returned shortly before we left. Although we complained to the staff, he didn't came by. Anyhow, we have of course complained (given that you pay 100 SGD for a piece of meat) and we have been offered dessert, which for sure was a very nice gesture but somewhat couldn't change the impression. Let me close by saying that the meat itself was good to very good, so at least this was ok. Rest definitely not
4
The lady picked Morton's for her birthday dinner for just me and her and we weren't disappointed. Staff super friendly, the place a little busy but we didn't get lost in the crowd, an amazing wine list, a menu that I wanted back here in Australia. Bacon and cheese macaroni, Alaskan crab legs, New York strip and filet mignon stood out the most. A little pricey all up but this place is a little bit special, planning my return visit as I type.
5
We went to Morton's for our 10th anniversary. I have to admit that the evening started off badly as we had to wait 30 minutes for our (pre-booked) table. The bar area was pretty poor ... I had to walk to the bar and order drinks rather than someone coming and taking our order (the waitresses ignored us for some reason).After we got our table things turned out much better ... it was awesome. The waiters and the restaurant manager were great. No, better than great ... you couldn't have asked for better service. And the steak was amazing. Really good.I feel like I want to complain about the poor start to the evening ... but everything else was so perfect that it's hard to give Mortons anything but 5 stars. It's a steak house ... and it's expensive ... but it's amazing
5
Food amazing and service fantastic, Kenneth thanks very much for looking after us on our 1st wedding anniversary.
5
Expensive but quality and service makes it alright. Sit at bar area in middle of lobby for a chill out experience. Ross the server is fun and made us feel very welcome

Mortons need get off their bottoms and get over here and protect their Name.
If they are still alive God's save them!
Multinationals wake up!
Steak average at best, but perhaps the customers are used to boiled buffalo!

Agreed it's not a cheap night out but the food at Morton's is exceptional. Great vibe in the restaurant, great service, excellent food!Wine list is fab, the steaks personify the adage "melts in your mouth" and the sundae for dessert is insanely good!Mortons is always a definite on our Singapore restaurant list

Mortons Singapore is always good for a nice steak . However the joy on each occasion turn very painful when the bill arrives !!The five peppercorn steak is priced at S$ 138 - that is US$ 110. A less pricer option was the rib eye at S$ 90. The wine list is ridiculously priced as well. We tried one of the 'lower ' priced ones for .....wait for it.....S$ 165 (US$ 133). We added Mash potatoes and Asparagus for sides and finished with a chocolate soufle to share between two of us.And the bill was ....S$ 635 (US$ 508) for a basic meal for 2. Ouch Ouch Ouch.....No complaints about the food quality but.....the prices are insane. No wonder Singapore is the most expensive city in the world for an expat to live in......Despite the pricing, Mortons is always packed with customers and for good reason....really great food.........you just have to forget about the bill coming later to enjoy the food !

The service is good and friendly, treating everyone like important guests which is no surprise given what they charge.We ordered the tenderest cut, fillet mignon. The meat were cook well for the done-ness ordered however my medium rare was way too salty tt I could hardly taste the natural taste of the meat. Thankful that they dun serve their steak with gravy though.We ordered the sautÃ©ed button mushroom and spinach which was nicely seasoned and cooked to preserve the natural sweetness of the mushrooms and spinach. The free bread that came with the meal taste a bit like foccacia with onions and was served nicely warm and crisply roasted. Desserts cost about 5x more than other places selling similar desserts. To our disappointment a similar dessert that we like better is only 1/5 of the price. Cheesecake was at $25 and carrot cake at $24.Nice touch of a small lit candle surrounded by ice for friend who's having birthday when we preferred to have a complimentary dessert from the 2 we ordered. They also had our photo taken for an extra gift.I hv tasted better steaks elsewhere at 1/2 or 1/3 of what Morton's charge.The lighting in the restaurant was too dim. I don't see myself returning again
4
We have been going to this restaurant for our birthdays and anniversaries. And each time, they never fail us - food, service, everything. Every course from the appetizer (crab cake), soup (lobster bisque), main course (poterhouse, prime cuts, etc), and desserts (hot chocolate cake) - WOW!!!. I am not a chocolate lover but will never miss their hot chocolate cake - just yummy.Yes....it is a bit expensive but you get good food and good service. Not to mention if you are dining there for a special occasion, the menu is specially printed for you for this day
5
My son was off to join National Service and we organized a farewell dinner at Morton's. The starters were a gentle preview to the food on its way for the rest of the evening. A family of four, each one ordered a different cut for our mains and couldn't decide which was best. The side orders stood their ground in taste and texture and complimented the juicy steaks perfectly. All this and a rich selection of wines enhanced our dining experience further.The evening culminated in a gastronomic carnival of a, mouth-watering, lip-smacking, selection of delectable desserts. Thank you, Morton's Steak House, for giving us a memorable evening.Going to Singapore? Your trip will be incomplete without a meal at Morton's.Do remember to book in advance or you are very likely to be disappointed
5
"So expensive lah" I can hear the locals protesting as they tend to do about anything that is not regarded as cheap (I say this endearingly, especially as I find myself often joining in).Morton's is not a cheap night out but it ranks as the best steak I have ever had in Singapore, outside of those cooked lovingly on the BBQ on my balcony. We've tried others, as you tend to do in search of a great steak. Lawry's? Not even close, Rive Gauche at Robertson Quay? Value for money and worth a try. Wolfgang Puck? Really good. The Prime Society at Dempsey? Expensive and somewhat disappointing.But Morton's? Great service, fantastic food and you get to walk out very satisfied as you mutter "so expensive lah" as you secretly plan your next special occasion

It was a random pick of a steak restaurant so didn't make reservation. It was slightly before peak dinner hour so no waiting needed luckily. Staffs were friendly and good service. We ordered a prime rib-eye steak to share. It was very tender and nicely done. Compared to the branch in Hong Kong, Singapore branch is bette
5
Great food, great service! Attention Singapore!!!! This is what a steak is supposed to taste like! Again ATTENTION Singapore!!!!! This is what service is supposed to look like!!!!!! PAY ATTENTION! Use Morton's as your template! ;)
4
If you like a good, tender and delicious steak whilst visiting Singapore this an excellent place to visit. Service was good and the Martinis perfect prior to tucking into a perfect steak. Atmosphere of the room excellent and definitely worth a visit
1
Steak here was equivalent to A$100 for a steak. Never would I pay that and this did not include vegetables. A friend had just mineral water and some bread and was charged A$56. Don't go here.
3
Food is average and considering the prices it is way too overpriced. It is not a restaurant recommended for the steak at these prices but more for the hype associated with the fact that you went there.Service in comparison to Morton restaurants in the US is below par and needs serious attention to detail, awareness of the diners needs and overall service quality leaves much to be desire
5
Reservation is recommendable. Reservation asked us if this dinner is for a special occasion. It was in fact the birthday of one of our family members and the restaurant surprised us with a cake at the end of the meal. The Steaks were huge in size and the quality of the meat delicious, and so were the side dishes, all cooked exactly how we wanted it. Service was efficient and friendly. As expected food and wine were very expensive but it was worth it. For a good premium steak Morton's is one of the two best steakhouses in Singapore
5
One of the best steaks in town. Although pricy but the portions are huge. Porterhouse steak is more than enough for 2 persons. Service is good and the service manager called me within 10 mins of making an online reservation. Staff is knowledgeable and provide recommendations based on the occasion and your dietary preferences. Crab cake and lava cake is really nice ... must try
3
It just wasn't the same thing and I've been to many of their branches when I lived in the States for 6 years.I had the prime rib 18 oz which I split with my cousin - we're Asians, we can't eat that size. I've had this cut in the past before. Yes, it was tender but I remember the ones in the States was more tender. I also had to put salt in my steak.BTW, it is expensive. But you knew that going in so suck it up. The waitress advised us to get one of those special offers which come with steak (we upsized to better and larger cut), choice of seafoods and choice of sidings and split it. I thought that was nice of her
4
Since reservations is highly recommended, we did via online and it was easy. A day prior to the dinner , there was a reminder sent as well. Upon greeted by the host , we were led to our table in the restaurant. Since it was our anniversary dinner, they have prepared a personalized menu for us! Since it was our first visit, we asked our server for suggestion on what to order. In the end, we had prime ribeye , fillet mignon, lobster bisque, mac & cheese and a complimentary hot chocolate cake. Mrs love her fillet mignon. It's was very tender and lean and easy to eat for the ladies. I had a 16oz ribeye and it was very fulfilling. It was cooked to perfection, moist and succulent. As for the mac & cheese, we find it rather dry and bland. Probably we are too used to rich cheese flavor. The hot chocolate cake was heavenly. Although it was rather pricey, the service and food standard masks up for it

On the recommendation of family we celebrated my wifes 77th birthday at Mortons Steakhouse at the Mandarin Oriental Singapore. The whole occassion was absolutely brilliant. The Steaks were cooked to perfection and were delicious. The ambiance could not be faulted. The staff who were most professional,efficient and friendly, my thanks
3
comparing prices here with Morton's in Macau, Singapore is terribly expensive. But service is excellent & the beef are the main attraction here. You won't go wrong with ordering the steak!
4
Happy hour - half price cocktails, normally 28 singapore dollars. Free steak sandwiches are a definite win.

OK, Morton's and I have a Love/Hate relationship. We have been patronizing them for years, on and off. And when Morton's is on, they are definitely on. But the problem is that in my opinion, it is a complete roll of the dice. Because at least 50% of the times we have been there, Morton's have definitely been off their game. For the prices they charge, a lot more is expected. Lobster bisque with one measly little piece of lobster in it would be laughable, if you didn't bother to look at the price. Baked potatoes which are crunchy in the middle are simply unacceptable. Shrimp Alexander which is so bland that one suspects it might have been frozen (on an island? Gosh, I hope not...) is embarrassing.All that said, the beef is consistently superb. Yes, it is pricey, but if you want top shelf goods, be prepared to pay top shelf prices. Where Morton's drops the ball is in their embarrassing lack of consistency. Great food and impeccable service one visit, then a month later it is almost as if you have gone to a different restaurant. If for nothing more than the consistency of the food and the service, we spend our money at Cut in MBS these days. Similar pricing, but far superior in virtually every way. I so wish Morton's would get their act together. If they could just be consistent, we would gladly become regular patrons once again. Thanks

For some reason, the menu choices have been greatly reduced, the trolley gone, but this is still a Morton's steakhouse. There is no bone-in Rib Eye selection. But the porterhouse medium rare with a balsamic glaze is just as delicious and compelling. The garlic flavored mash potatoes with extra butter and sour cream is equally addictive. The ice berg lettuce wedge with extra blue cheese dressing and bacon bits is as good any salad gets. Also, the dome like onion bread with creamy butter is still there and thankfully so. But the crab cake appetizer is just ok.... not as sublime as the salad, steak, or potatoes but is very acceptable. Same goes for the chocolate mousse which is generously portioned and is rich and delicious. I wasn't impressed with the wine by the glass choices. But I was overwhelmed with the bill when it arrived. Definitely, a record amount for me.In any event, I came away from the dining experience with an incredible aftertaste and a rich memory of outstanding and delicious food which is the reason why I visit any Morton's Steakhouse anywhere in the world

We went there as group of 5 meat eaters. We ordered some starters to share, nothing to shout about and it was some what disappointing. However when the mains came, I ate very quietly enjoying every single bite of my 350gm NY strip loin. Wow! We had the Cajun rib-eye to share. Now usually I do not like my meat marinated in any kind of sauces but this particular Cajun rib-eye changed my perception. To this date I am craving for it. It was simply crispy with herbs and spices on the outside and cook to perfection on the inside. Remarkable! Will I go back? He'll yes. Kudos to the chef! See you soon.

Have we been lucky, we arrived the 31st of December after an exhausting roadtrip of 45 days in Singapore and did not prepare anyhing special for that night. We called Morton's and they told us we can have last seating on 10.30 but needed to order before 11.00. They would serve us as long as we wanted to stay. And they did!At 11.45 they asked us to come outside on the balcony there we had an amazing view on the fireworks in the bay, I think over hundred Thousand people were gathered in front of the Mandarin Oriental where we enjoyed our champagne while looking at this amazing spectacle! (had no idea about this when we booked)After the fireworks they served us our maincourse a wonderful juicy steak, others took Alaskan Crablegs after that desert and we had several more hours before we went home. I would say, Singapore is probably a bit far for us next year otherwise I would know where I would spend New Year 2015

You do get what you pay for and yes it is very expensive but was really nice to have a tasty steak dinner in Singapore just for a change. We had a table booked but were not seated for 20 minutes, service was pretty slow too. The sheer number of staff singing happy birthdays was very off-putting and not very classy for the surroundings - once I can take, but 5 times over the course of 2 hours was quite annoying. Partner had the shrimp to start, tasty but very disappointed to hear they were not locally sourced. Overall a good meal but not outstanding for the price

We visit Morton's every 6 months or so when my sons are on vacation from college.This time we started in the bar, as they were promoting large martinis and free steak sandwiches. They were busy, as a result of this and, for some reason, only had two staff visibly serving. As a result, our orders were taken swiftly but then took some time to arrive. Strangely, the apple tea taking the longest? When they arrived, the drinks were delicious.We had to wait for the steak sandwiches, as we learned they were only served every 20 minutes; not something we noticed in the promotional literature. When they arrived, they were delicious.After drinks, we retired to the booth table for the main event. We were looked after by "Kendrick" who did everything he could to ensure our experience was great. He helped us with the order, took our orders, delivered drinks and the huge loaf of freshly made bread to us.We ordered scallops, lamb chops, fillet and the rib-eye.All were delicious. The char Morton's manage to achieve is balanced really well with the juicy and tasty meat. All the steaks were cooked to their medium-rare perfection.We finished off with chocolate lava cake and the immense and incredibly light soufflÃ© they specialise in. However, if you love desserts, you will want to see the trolley as well, as the carrot cake, key lime pie and chocolate mousse all looked impressive.One minor criticism we had was we felt the decor is a little on the dark and gloomy side. Nothing to worry about but it may be time for refurbishment to modernise. Or maybe this is part of the Morton's 'look'.We finished the evening considerably poorer than we started, as Morton's is seriously expensive and we wanted to look after Kendrick, given his great service.However, it is worth every dollar and we did not need to eat for the next 18 hours

After trying mortons in Macau and Hong Kong, I had to try mortons Singapore. Very impressive setting in the mandarin Oriental. Food and service of the highest standard. Only one slight negative is the Jazz music can get a bit tedious and rather loud. Complimentry Port after meal was a nice touch
2
$550 dollars for two including wine is in the same price bracket as 2 & 3 Michelin starred restaurants; you'd therefore expect a flawless experience for that price.Service:Plenty of fake smiles and too much pressure to order - no doubt to turn tables. Waiters seem to disappear constantly throughout the meal. You also get a token visit from the manager who asks how everything is - although he manages to do this without looking you in the face. All very false and contrived.Food: Bread they serve on arrival is baked from frozen and not enough butter.Steaks - massively overpriced and a huge let down. 100 dollars per steak for prime rib which has far too much fat and is basted in what tasted like gravy granules is simply ridiculous. Side dishes at $25 dollars each were, again, overpriced and the mash potato was lumpy, the asparagus overcooked and the mushrooms literally swimming in butter.If you are looking for a great steak restaurant in Singapore, i'd really suggest looking elsewhere
5
I went to Morton's following a friend suggestion, and so far after many trip in this city and the many diners in the Singapore restaurant scene, I can say that here IO had the best steak so far!!
5
With there with husband to celebrate anniversary. Warm reception by the staff, totally impressed! Had the best juicy steak. Environment warm and cosy Total cost for the 2 of us $400++, experience priceless! Will be back again!
5
After a month of traveling and eating non American food we broke down and came here for a great steak! Prices are high compared to the US, but the food and service is just as great as it is at home.
5
I have been visiting Morton's several time. Non of negatives encountered. Flawless service by Aida and the team.USDA steak is almost first class. Will patronize this again and again. This is definitely must. Thanks for the consistency and keep it up! One of the best steakhouse in Singapore and Asia
5
I've been to both morton and cut at mbs and honestly, morton was better. I was at the outlet at mandarin Oriental and the steak was cooked to perfection. Succulent and just to my liking. Price wise I'd say morton is more value for money, only cos I preferred the steak here
5
I have eaten here a few times .if one would like to have a good selection of steaks than this is the. Best location in this city to have one the quality is as good as in the USA the wine selection is nice .the value as one should expect in an high level restaurant .definitly not overpriced . Service very goo

This is my 3rd time to this restaurant and this is a place for people who love steak. We started with the creamy lobster bisque but i feel the soup is lack of the seafood flavour. Next, we had the iceberg salad with blue cheese and the blue cheese toppings is marvellous... I loved it....We also had the creamed spinach and I felt this dish too rich after having the blue cheese.We also ordered the porterhouse steak and ribeye steak but I personally love the marble fats, juicy texture of the porterhouse. Lastly, still managed to squeeze in a little room for the legendary hot chocolate to end this perfect dinner
5
Love their steaks. Ordered their Signature Cut New York Strip - 20oz for S$134, was pretty worth it and enough for 2 to share. Perfectly prepared in terms of doneness - our medium rare steak came out just as how it should be. The meat was juicy and the seasoning was excellent
4
The lobster soup is ordinary but the iceberg salad with lots of blue cheese toppings is fantastic to go with the red wine.Wines selection is great .Surprisingly 3 of us prefered the aus potterhouse over the US ribeye .But the prices for food is extremely high considering the 90 to 130 range for ribeye n potterhouse as costs for both of these are pretty low , I guess we are paying for the great service and also the quality of the cooking plus a very nice ambience for a steak house .580 sgd for 2 soups 1 salad 2 steaks , 1 side dish and a 2005 rioja reserve at 140 sgd ...hmmmmm portions are huge though

6 people, no complaints, what more can I say. Restaurant is busy and a little noisy, would not do for a romantic evening I think, but as a friends and family gathering it was spot on. Have been to Mortons in New Orleans so had an idea what to expect, this was a better steak, and better wait staff. Asked for a Wine recommendation, also spot on and we are fussy about wine. Thoroughly enjoyable evening all around, thank you

We'd had this place recommended to us. First of all, the place was noisy on the night we went... we are both a bit deaf and the clanking of cutlery and roar of conversations all around was a bit much. Having said that, all it shows really is that it is popular and we're a bit deaf!I found the food to be a bit curate's eggish. The bread was horrid (I'm European and it was American) and the vegetables lacked finesse. Lyonnais potatoes were huge and floury, lacking taste: not a lot like the dish I was expecting, to be honest. The other veg seemed to have been microwaved and were generally no more than ok. On the other hand the rest of the food was super. Very good steak, cooked just as asked for, wonderful oysters and scallops, followed by some nice desserts.The service was a bit scrappy at the beginning (no-one brought the asked for wine list, the horrid bread was plonked down by a waiter in a tearing hurry) but as the place emptied, it got better. American portions, I guess... large, so you feel you've had value for your Singapore Dollars
4
The meat is great, very tender, delicious to eat. good to go for business meeting.Only minus is the light there, the room is too dark, we could barely see our menu and after our plate, several tables around us had to use the handphone to lighten their menu/dis

Trust me, they know what they are doing or they wouldn't have been so popular for so long. Morton's is a classic American style steakhouse opened in Singapore for over 10 years. Not many places can claim they use Prime USDA beef. The ribeye for me is a juicy as a newborn baby. Ok I don't think that was a good metaphor, but the point is it's really tasty. Morton's bar also has a ridonkulous happy hour 5-7pm (mon-sat) which gives you a triple shot martini for $12.95 and free flow mini steak sandwiches. Camp by the door if you want to reach it before the eyeing guests all snap it up like zombies to fresh meat. It's a pricey restaurant but hey, if it wasn't good who would come back for 10 years to give them money?Read the full review with steak photos here!http://sethlui.com/food-review-mortons-steakhouse-singapore

I rarely review restaurants, but this place was such a disappointment I had to write a review, in the interest of encouraging people to save their money and go elsewhere. Dreadful from beginning to end, with terrible service and ambience, from the cutlery, crockery, glassware and table setting, to the food, which was below par in quality and presentation. The only redeeming feature being the steak, which was fine, but horrendously over priced. Luckily, there are much better places to get a good steak in Singapore, for less money and in a much more ambient setting; in my opinion Woolloomooloo delivers a far superior quality and experience for less money than Morton's.Frankly surprised that the Mandarin Oriental allow such poor standards in their hotel
5
Wonderful steaks, I had the rib eye which was superb and tried some of my friends Cajun Rib eye in Southern USA spices - equally delicious. I went with seven friends for an evening out and really enjoyed it. I have had good steaks in other restaurants but Mortons is the place if you love your steaks. A good selection id side dishes is also available for your steaks including mashed potatoes to die for, mushrooms, onion rings, creamed spinach and Brussels sprouts. Attentive service which was not over bearing. Enjoy
1
Was eagerly anticipating my meal here. Was a special occasion and from the get go service was bad. The server messed up our steaks! I asked for a ribeye and she triedTo pass a new york cut as a ribeye. What a liar i know my steaks and called the managerHe apologised and said this was the ribeye cut closer to the striploin, another LIE.He decided to replace with a true ribeye but served it welldone instead of medium rare.Hd him called again and he replaced a second time this time it was good but the memory ofLies and bad service are seared in my brain. Never coming back here again

the bar at mortonsMandarin Oriental SingaporeFourth Storey5 Raffles AvenueMarina Square, SingaporeA classy place to get some good martinis and steak sandwiches, this is the place to be especially during their happy hours from 5-7pm, Mons - Sats. The steak sandwiches are FREE ! and good.Many land up for the sandwiches i suspect , but their martinis are the yes you can get in Singapore. You have to arrive early around 5pm if you want a table without reservatio

Whilst located in the Mandarin Oriental, I quite liked the casual nature of the restaurant. The tenderloin steak I had was a perfect medium rare complemented beautifully by the grilled asparagus with balsamic vinegar and chips on the side. Dessert looked really good and I appreciated the offer to order hot desserts when ordering the main course to ensure that you didn't have to wait too long for it to be served post mains.Seating is a bit strange so do ask when making reservations for two to have a table where you face your guest rather than end up sitting next to each other.
5
It was one of the best steaks I have ever eaten!“Now, let’s go for eating delicious steak!” said my colleague who lives in Singapore.We worked a half day in the afternoon even on Saturday at the office.The work we were supposed to do was finished around 6pm.He drove me on the highway but I didn’t know where he was heading for.About an hour drive took us to the Mandarin Oriental near the Singapore International Convention & Exhibition Centre, Suntec City Mall, Millenia Walk and office towers.It was done some rehearsal for the ceremony of Singapore National Holiday on August 9 and there were so many people got together there.He kept on driving and got into the parking in the Mandarin Oriental.We took an elevator up to the 4th floor and finally I realized we were heading for the Morton’s The Steakhouse in Singapore. It is located on the 4th Story of Mandarin Oriental, which is situated in the heart of the Commercial and Central Business District. Inside of the restaurant was dark but rather huge. It is not like in Singapore, but in the US. The menu was on the table and we studied it while talking about general topics about Japan and business we are involved in.We have decided to share the appetizers and ordered “Jumbo Shrimp Cocktail” and “Dozen Oysters on the Half Shell.”I have ordered “Signature Cut Prime New York Strip” with RARE.But the waiter in charge of our table told me that our “RARE” is cold in the center and I recommend you to eat “MIDIUM RARE” which is hot in the center.”Since I did not want to eat meat with center cold, I followed his suggestion.The appetizers were perfect, which we shared and enjoyed ourselves eating them.The ordered steak came! It is big which is within the range of my expectation.However the quality of the beef was far beyond my expectation.It was soft, tender, juicy and delicious. I didn’t remember when I ate such high quality beef last time.I have eaten beefs many times in Singapore, but it was the first time I was so impressed by the quality and taste of beef.If you like steaks, it is really worthwhile to visit MORTON'S THE STEAKHOUSE!(Dinner on July 20, 2013
3
Make no mistake Mortons serves good steaks. But I have no idea how they justify the prices, £12.for a side of chips? We had a good night here but dinner for three at over £500 really is a bit rich, even if you can afford it
5
We got great service & great food. Had to wait 30 mins to get a table. A bit pricy though. Still would definitely go back again.
2
Service was terrible right from the start of making reservations. It was as if they wished you did not come to the restaurant.
Food was average for the price. Ordered a Prime Rib cooked medium rare, was given a raw piece of meat.
5
My husband and I used to come to Morton's a few special times a year when we lived back home. After living here in Singapore for the past six months (and contracted to be here for two more years) we have exhausted a lot of restaurants that are worth the high prices here in Singapore.Then, I found out there is a Morton's here at the Mandarin Oriental!Our last few meals we have shared a cold platter for two - clams, oysters, shrimp, mussels FOUR STARS!Ahi Tuna appetizer which I will not order again. To me, the tuna should be the star of the dish and it was laden with cream, avocado, tortilla chips. Not greatMy husband had the shrimp cocktail, fantastic! They are as big as a babies foot and Ice cold!Lobster bisque 2-3 stars. One tiny little chunk of Lobster in a very watered down, scorched, old lobar stock that was too old to be turned into bisqueLobster Mac and Cheese,soooooo good! So heavy but once in a while it is so decadent and deliciousBrussels sprouts with bacon, a little bitterOnion Rings - fantasticI always get the filet medium rare, absolutely wonderful! Buttery, seasoned perfectly, and cooked to perfection!My husband gets a medium rare cut of Prime Rib or a Ribeye...they are always fantastic as well!Now, the best part of going to Morton's is that they can make a great dirty Martini with blue cheese stuffed olives
5
I like coming to Morton's as the steaks here are the best I've had in Singapore, and better than any I've had in the UK. This at US standards and being set in the Mandarin Oriental the service is top-notch too. The steak will appear expensive to many overseas visitors, but beef is generally more expensive here in Singapore anyway, so why not pay for quality and save your money for local hawker food.We had cocktails before during happy hour, being a weekday there were free steak sandwiches offered but this was refused by us as we knew the size of the steaks to come.Morton's is great for birthdays with a personalised menu and a free soufflé for me the birthday boy. I had a Porterhouse (equivalent to UK T-bone). My wife had a steak and surf set as the steak is a more modest size. My medium-rare steak melted in my mouth.For side the Idaho potato was cooked to perfection, we also had a side salad and brussel-sprouts again perfectly cooked.The corkage is a bit pricey as SGD100, or 50 pounds, good job we had a decent Italian red to go with the meal (another treat).At times you have to pay for the good things in life, so recommend a steak here at Morton's
5
I dined here a few days ago and wow the food was amazing, the ribeye steak was absolutely delicious and melted in your mouth. And the sides that accompanied it were incredible, the creamy mash was so smooth and silkly that it felt like eating cream and the mushrooms cooked to perfection. One thing I think they can improve on is the peppercorn sauce it was okay but not amazing, but the steak more than made up for it. It was the best ribeye I have had and I have dined in top steak restaurants in London. As for price it was reasonable £30 just for the steak which was at least 400grams including sides and service charge and cheaper in comparison to London.
5
I really like this restaurant as do several friends. The service is exceptional as are the steaks and the rest of the menu. The wine list is also quite good. The service can be a litlte formal at times and I could imagine some people being intimadated by this but don't be. I've had occasion to return a steak or bottle of wine and this has always been handled very proffesional and courteously by the staff.The only warning I would add is that be careful what you order, you can find yourself struggling to eat it all
2
You would think due to the pricing of this steak restaurant and how this restaurant is in mandarin oriental you would expect a certain level of service, atmosphere, food however this could be further from the experience there. In my experience there1. The restaurant uses dim lighting to create the atmosphere however its more or less hiding the fact that many parts of the ceiling in the restaurant have black and brown spots - there not part of the design2. Dress code not required as many people went in with a t shirt, with shorts and flip flops and even questionable clothing.3. It would have been nice if management did not allow people to take photos of there food. A couple in front of me with a professional camera spend more than 30 minutes taking photos of there food using flash on there camera4. While I understand english can be a hard language to learn - not being able to understand many of the things staff said makes asking questions and placing orders become more difficult.5. Food - between a prime rib, potatoes, tenderloin, food was average in taste. but ok in sizeOverall for the price you pay to eat here I would only say try somewhere else, but if you do come here set your expectation’s very lo
4
A martini or two at the bar here never fails to relax me and companion before a night out. on some nights the wannabes could be a minor irritation but find a quiet corner and you can have a quiet conversation. Martinis are among the best in town
5
Words cannot explain the steaks that are served at Morton's Steak house. Their food is just good clean wholesome goodness served on a plate with a side of decadent fries or mash. Though this is a place that my wallet can only afford to visit once a year, it is the one place that I look forward to coming back to every time. The crabcakes are filled with chunks of real crab meat, though this does set you back 40 dollars for one piece!The French Onion soup is one of the best soups I have ever tasted, its flavour is rich, sweet and wholesome, just like your mother used to make... but better. Any of the steaks are a good choice, however, just note that the portions are massive. It doesn't make sense to order a smaller portion each since it is only a few dollars cheaper. Just go for the bigger size and share between two, it's more than enough for both. Make sure to save room for dessert, they look absolutely fabulous! I have always been enticed to order the other cakes, but, I always only have space for one - their signature chocolate lava cake. This has to be the best lava cake available in Singapore. It's definitely not cheap, but the service and the food makes it a very worth while and enjoyable visit every single time
4
What can I say, the place is an institution and perennially packed (at least in Singapore). Appetizers are at $25 to more (ie, what mains used to cost in normal restos just a few years ago...), a steak can easily be $100. Both are excellent: the lumpy crab meat or cocktail monster-shrimp for starters, and I think I had the rib-eye for main which was one of the best, most buttery steaks I've had here. One thing, besides the tab: the staff didn't know who had ordered what. It's not the end of the world, but in steakhouses in the US, I rarely witnessed this. When commanding certain prices, a venue should then offer a less amateurish service
5
They truly know how to cook a good steak. The loaf of bread is a meal in itself, and portions of everything are huge. I only had steak (twice) but the seafood is also very special. Go with a group or get a seat at the bar for one, either way it's great. Staff very attentive, concierge/restaurant bosses are also exceptionally helpful
5
Had ours daughter graduation dinner last night and we were totally happy. Nice service, great waiter and best steaks and deserts:)) a truly special evening and I am so happy to see Morton 's back to it good service. Last November I had a pretty back experience w my daughters birthday, steak were still great but the rest appalling. Happy to see the management took action. Best steak in town
5
The meal was really top notch. The food is not as expensive as I had aticipated after reading all the reviews so I was surprised to find that the food was rather reasonably priced. But what can set you back is the wine but on the other hand that is every diners own choice if and what kind you want to enjoy. The jumbo shrimp alexander was amazing and so was the steak with grilled jumbo aspargus - would go back here the next time I am in Singapore
3
We came here for a birthday celebration and had a lovely evening, mostly thanks to the great service. While the food was good, I probably wouldn't return - great steaks, but Morton's in Singapore charges twice (or more) what they do in the US. While I always expect to pay more in Singapore, I think Morton's has gone a bit over the top - it's a good steakhouse, but it's not a meal worth $400 SGD for two people, even by expensive Singapore standards.You'll have a good meal, but know what to expect - it's $100+ for a steak, about $30-$40 for a starter and about $25 for a side and the usual for a bottle of wine in Singapore. The food's good, but over-priced. The focus is on the steaks - our sides weren't the greatest and were left mostly untouched.Service was great
3
I've eaten here many times over the years - but it has been a few years since my last visit and it has gone downhill badly - and sadly - since my last visit.I always tell people - or at least I used to - that the crab cakes at Morton's might be the best thing I have ever eaten. Amazing, succulent jumbo lumps of crab meat gently held together in some mysterious way. No potato or breadcrumbs. But that was then. Now (May 2013) they are a very sad main course (or appetiser). Dry, stringy and incredibly disappointing.The crab cakes are now $110++ as a main course - you need to order (and pay for) the vegetables / potatoes separately. So a main course is now about $150++. For that price you need to get it right.Service is irritating unless you are there for a birthday party. We were at a business dinner and trying to have a sober discussion so having a clown (minus the costume) cracking lame jokes as a waiter was unwelcome. To be fair, he would have been appropriate if it had been a celebration, but it was not. Waiters seem to struggle to understand the type of guest they are waiting on.They used to display the steak options on a tray so you could see what you were ordering before it was cooked. That has now stopped, which is a shame.My 3 colleagues had steaks and enjoyed them - but I would not return
5
Tried the steak (can't remember what I ordered) but it was very good. Be careful with the portion you order as it can be huge! But you dun have to worry too much cos the waiter will show you samples of the steaks on a platter so that you have an idea exactly how big they are
5
I have been to Morton privately and on business occasions and every time it has been fantastic. Be aware you can share steaks, and all of them are huge, so it makes sense. Eating steaks here is very close to eating steaks in the US, same excellent quality. I highly recommend
2
We went to Morton's for my husband's birthday dinner so I was very pleased with the service when we arrived and the menu card with a birthday greeting, which included my husband's name. The lobster bisque was delicious and but I didn't like my tenderloin. It was cooked medium rare, as I asked, but it was a tough piece of steak, not at all tender when I cut through it, and I even found some gristle in it, which I didn't eat and moved to the side of my plate when finished. In the past I would complain but I decided not to send it back because it was my husband's birthday and our first date night since having our baby. We were both exhausted and didn't want to deal with it.However I was very disappointed with the quality of my tenderloin and had to douse it in sauce, which was quite bland. The grilled asparagus was also very bland and not to my liking. Also when our bottled water ran out, no one asked if we wanted more water so we had to ask for some more water when the desserts came. The server was attentive at first and took our picture but overall, I didn't feel a great quality of attention and food for the fine dining price.That said, we did appreciate the birthday cake - my husband loved the cheesecake and it was a generous portion - and I really enjoyed the chocolate lava cake.Overall, I found Morton's Singapore very disappointing and feel the quality has declined since we last ate there - maybe, a year or two ago
2
it's gotten too expensive for what it delivers. 3 mains, 3 sides, 1 espresso, 1 raspberry, 2 bottles of water puts you back over 500 sgd.we ordered the steaks to be done 'medium' and they came overcooked and dry. the service was poor. the waiter was too chatty and talked about things he knew embarrassingly little of.so yeah, the steak gets overcooked, the service is bad, the value for money is terrible, the atmosphere is primarily loud. apart from all that it is not a bad place
5
Mortons is Mortons. It is the same in Singapore as it is in Chicago and NY. Good, massive yet expensive steaks served as you like it. Pro's1. Steaks, how you want when you want. They are genuinely the best steaks in Singapore2. Ambiance - for a brief moment you can believe that you are not actually in Singapore but a real US steak / grill house. Cons:1. Although the hotel is inside the Mandarin Oriental it is not an MO restaurant. Consequently the staff attitude and service differs accordingly. 2. $90 ++ for a filet. Go figure BUT meat is expensive in Singapore and this is the best place for it. Ultimately if you are going to Mortons you know it is going to cost you close to 400 SGD for two with wine. 3. Because of the price your fellow diners are either brokers, bankers or birthday celebrations. Again go figure on the ambiance.
5
Perhaps the greatest steak we have eaten,portions too large for jet lagged English appetite but flavour and cooking was perfection. No hesitation about delivering a hot blue rib eye!
4
As an American living in Singapore, I find myself periodically longing for a little taste of home... and Morton's is a great place. Inside the popular Mandarin Oriental hotel (which is attached to Marina Square Mall), Mortons is a popular ex-pat hang out. There is the restaurant (be prepared for a 25% premium on the prices vs. the states) as well as the bar (in the center of the hotel). I recommend the bar - as they serve free prime rib sandwiches during happy hour. Which you may need, because the drink prices are STEEP ($15 SGD - $30 SGD per drink that's not tap water)
5
If you are planning to dine in style and enjoy the pampering service, come to Morton's in Mandarin Oriental and indulge the delicious stake. If you are waiting for your dining table to be ready, you may opt to have a drink in the bar and obtain some good discount for it. The minute you are seated, you will be served with a fresh baked loaf along with butter. Your designated waitress will be at your table to display the raw meats that are recommended for the night. All type of sizes and origins, and it taste super awesome.I would recommend for starters to take the Jumbo Prawn Platter (if i get the name right). The prawns are hugeee and extremely delicious. Do not over order your meals as the portion may be looking small however it makes you tummy tight by the first half.We enjoyed the ambiance, the classy dining, the rose wine, the good old steak and importantly the service. I could never ask for more
3
Eaten here on a number of occasions to mixed reviews. Have had some reasonable meals but also some awful ones, including a very unpleasant rib eye steak that was hopelessly cooked. Not worth the money in my opinion, the steak is better at Dolce Vita in the same Hotel
5
The steak is the quality that you would expect. So is the price.. The wines are extensive and pricey..as you'd expect. The service is good..as you'd expect. ..The location is typical ..in a hotel overlooking the bay ...as you'd expect ...and will I return ..?...It's expected of me so yes I will 
5
This is NOT a everyday steak house ...be prepared to be pamper and also shock by the prices ...I go for special occasion and maybe when I'm feeling real stress ...the steak are I would say the best in town .you pay ..you gets great food with super service ...
5
Went to Morton's Singapore 3rd April with our daughter and son in law. Perfect food great service brilliant atmosphere!! What more could you ask for? Maybe bill a little top heavy but really is the best!! Would I go back? You bet like a shot exceptional!!
4
First time back at Mortons after about 4 years. I'd been trying the newer places in Singapore (like Cut and Bedrock), but as I needed to catch a late flight I arrange for dinner there to make it easier. The steak was cooked superbly, and as usual I couldn't eat it all. Service was great and the place was packed. I'd certainly go back again. The only downside is that the toilets are not located inside the restaurant ... but I think I can cope with that when the food is great

My lasting memory will be the cost of a steak .. around S$120 to S$150. But that said it was a good steak which needed a S$250 wine to wash down the shock. Price aside the service, choice and quality here is good. But not one for the faint hearted

We had a lovely meal in Mortons with excellent service. Our waiter wasn't hugely knowledgable about what wines they had available as our first choice was not available but this was rectified and we enjoyed a good Montepulciano - pricey but that was to be expected. I ordered the Fillet Mignon and my husband ordered a Ribeye - both were cooked to perfection. We also ordered some mushrooms, spinach and chips on the side. The spinach and mushrooms were really disappointing and tasted too salty and almost tinned - not what you expect when side dishes were well over Â£12 each! Although we really enjoyed our steaks and wine, I thought it was hugely overpriced for food that didnt taste all that fresh. We have had far better in the UK and paid a lot less The atmosphere was very nice though and service was very good considering we arrived very late after watching the light show at the Marina Bay Sands hotel and came complete with tripod - not quite the arrival we had planned at the Mandarin Oriental! Worth a visit but think more could be done to improve the quality and freshness of the side dishes
5
Great food, great service, great deserts in a quality atmosphere. It is typical of most Morton restaurants around the world. I go here often on special occasions and I am not disappointed ever.
3
I ordered a Cajun ribeye steak($102) which was slightly burnt but the taste not bad. for not bad taste it too expensive
4
You'll never be disappointed of your steak by Morton's. The service is perfect, the meat tender, juicy like in the US. The wine list decent and affordable.

Before last week, I had last visited Morton's in 2010.The food was still as good as I remembered, absolutely divine. However, I my experience is that the total cost of a meal at Morton's has roughly doubled since my last visit in 2010.The meat was always expensive (only the small 6oz portion will cost you less than 100 dollars), but it is after all the reason why one goes to Morton's.What seems to have caused the final bill for a meal at Morton's to double since my visit in 2010 are the extras. A bottle of plain water will set you back 17 dollars, a side order of spinach (as the meat comes without any garnishing) will cost you 30 dollars, a salad apetizer 50 dollars, and though we got one of the cheapest wine on the menu (a basic Australian Shiraz), we still ended up paying 130 dollars for it.My advice: do go to Morton's as the meat really is fabulous, but avoid all side-orders and extras, and drink tap water (no sure what the price for that is ;-

I have been to multiple Morton's, Ruth Criss and other high end steakhouses around the world. I must admit that we were shellshocked by the prices at this Morton's, which are not justified even with the higher prices in Singapore. Our waiter was attentive enough until dessert, when he was too preoccupied with a larger group to serve our soufflÃ© to us in a timely fashion. I had to get up and find someone near the kitchen to track him down after nearly 30 minutes. The manager Seth seemed to be gladhanding several regulars but couldn't be bothered to stop by tables in our section of the restaurant to see how our dining experience had been. My recommendation would be to have a few nice other Chinese or Indian meals (or even a dinner at the Raffles) instead of blowing US $375 for dinner for two adults and a child. Feed your inner carnivore the next time you are in the US or Canada (or even Europe) and hold onto your well-earned money in the meantime
5
This Morton's brought us home to the original style Morton's. The happy hour offered steak sandwiches made with prime filet mignon for FREE! We enjoyed dinner in the bar. I had the cajun rib eye and the wedge bites salad. My wife loves Morton's onion soup. The service was impeccable and Seth, the manager, offered personalized attention
5
I dine at Morton's once every year, and every occasion has been a wonderful experience. No doubt the prices have risen over the years (so has everything in Singapore), the quality of the steak served is still up to standard. I ordered the Signature Cut New York Strip. It was cooked to my liking, medium-rare. Charred on the outside, warm, pink and juicy in the inside.The only thing that has changed is that they no longer push the cart of meat and seafood over to your table and introduce the different kinds of steak and seafood dishes they have to offer. Their dessert tray has also shrunk but nevertheless, their cakes are still simply delicious
4
went there with colleagues for happy hour. totally enjoy the happy hour mortinis and not forgetting the filet mignon sandwiches. we stayed for dinner. one of my colleagues was not too happy with his rib eye. we had the baked seafood platter and it was divine. service is good
5
Yes, it's very pricey, but worth every penny if you have such a treat. Staff are pretty knowledgeable and very friendly. Nothing like a smile to start a meal, and it does the food justice. Side dishes are very common though, nothing "wow" but hey, we're here for the steak right
5
Morton's is my favorite steakhouse in Singapore. Walking through the front doors, you feel as if you're instantly transported to a traditional steakhouse in the U.S. The decor, generous use of dark wood, big booths, subtle lighting, smells and sounds -- it all works. It's all just right. Every course: the breads, the salads, the sides, the steaks and the desserts are world class. Everything is well prepared with fresh ingredients and the results are delicious. Instead of the elf-sized food at many high-end establishments, everything at Morton's comes in big, generous American-size portions. Come with your stretchy pants or be ready to bring home a doggie bag. Yes it's pricey, but the flavors dancing in your mouth make it all worth it. This place is definitely recommended when you're looking to do a little splurging and treat yourself to the best steaks in Singapore
5
Morton's Steak House delivers some of the best beef on the planet and certainly in Singapore. Went their with a couple of friends and we all left more than full bellies and those T-Bones were perfectly seared with tasty garnishments topping them off..
5
Conveniently located in the heart of Singapore, they really live up to their reputation of serving you the really best steak. I had the 24 oz Porter House, which was probably the best steak that I have had in years. Their lobster bisque was also really good. The service was good. They had a nice wine selection, and the server really spent time to recommend me with their best wine. Although very expensive, it was worth it for a special occasion
3
Confusingly, although it looks like a lunar command module dropped into the middle of the Mandarin Oriental Hotel, this is a completely separate enterprise. Whilst you can charge things to your room, the bar menu is different from the one for room service. This might be obvious to some people but led to a little confusion when we dropped in to the bar and asked for a Mandarin Sling and nonplussed the waiter. Apparently an offshoot of a well-known Chicago steakhouse, the bar is typically American i.e. crepuscular lighting, in fact near darkness regardless of the time of day. Although keen to sell us Martinis, we did eventually get a couple of very large Singapore Slings, served in beer glasses. The sting of 50+ Aus$ was slightly offset by complimentary mini rolls containing a sliver of steak. Allegedly filet mignon, it wouldn't have enticed me to eat there but I suppose it was better than the more usual saucer of peanuts
4
Can't go wrong with this steakhouse in bustling city Singapore. Well, it's on the high end diner, so expect to pay lots for it. Reservation is a must to avoid long queue. Good city spot too, close to the bay and easy access to the Sands
1
Staff need customer service training. Told to wait outside as we dared to be a few minutes early! One fillet overcooked and one undercooked! Maitre d just shrugged just shoulders! Would not survive in states. Very over priced, not worth a fraction of cost. Would not go back
5
When it comes to steak .. We have our favorite place, and it's Morton ! They have a huge selection of steak and wine. We've tried many steak houses in Singapore nothing better compare to this. However, The price is expensive (at least for us). Prepare at least 200 SGD per person before you go
5
I have been to mortons a couple of times and everytime the steak is cooked perfectly, this is by far my favourite restraunt! The chocolate cake dessert is brilliant as well. Anyone coming to singapore has to go here! And you dont have to have steak, the seafood is deliciouse as well
3
Morton's has definitely changed a lot since my first visit back in 2009 to celebrate my birthday.i was there yesterday but this time..to celebrate my brother's birthday.we chose morton because of their impeccable service and yummy steak..they were singapore no.1 steakhouse in the past...not sure now. The restaurant was pretty packed with expats and foreigners yesterday.could be a reason why their standards have dropped. So the menus had my bro's name on it just like how they would do for everyone's birthday etc...but gone are the "talking menus' where they would push out a trolley laid with all the different kind of steaks and desserts and patiently explain to you about the cuts, origin etc etc...now it is replaced by a tray of meat where the waiter would hastily explain so that he can go back to do his waitering job ... We ordered a couple of dishes...the chilled ocean platter ($180) was delicious and fresh but the steaks were disappointing. It no longer taste the same. I ordered a Cajun ribeye steak($102) which was slightly burnt at the corners.my mum ordered a double-cut rib lamb chop($104) and it was over done when she requested for a medium rare...Because it was my brother's birthday , they had prepared a complimentary soufflé...the soufflé had shrinked many times its size ...they used to give a big portion of the soufflé so it could be shared by 3-4 people...inflation maybe? And instead if having 3 or 5 staff to sing a birthday song like in the past..the process has been shorten ...with the receptionist personally coming to your table to take a photo and printing it out later. The photo was alright but the receptionist wrote my brother's name wrongly and did not bother to check and change it -.-Overall, the only thing that was great was the ocean platter. Judging from some of the reviews here and on hungrygowhere, it seems like I am not the only one that feels that the standards in morton has dropped. So...my advice to you is....unless you have a lot of spare cash to burn, morton is a good place for huge steak ...if not, go at your own risk!!

We came to Morton's on recommendation from our hotel for a great steak. We did enjoy our steaks, my partners steak was on the larger side. Unfortunately after the expensive prices for steak, nothing comes with the steak so you must order sides and sauces at additional charge, this is a little rich.The restaurant has a lovely atmosphere very intimate booth style seating.We ordered Singapore slings, not the best.We shared a chocolate mousse to finish, lovely touch the bring around the dessert tray for you to choose.I'm not sure its because we have great steak at reasonable prices in Australia, but this was overbearingly expensive for a drink and a steak
2
Horrible Manhattan --- not even a Manhattan --- I had it remade, and the second one was drinkable but still not really the correct drink. The atmosphere was fine. The steak sandwiches were pretty good --- during happy hour when they are free, it's probably worth going with a different drink, though my cocktail confidence here is low
4
Morton's has a great Happy Hour from 5-7, Monday through Saturday. Martinis are on special for $12.50 and they throw in a few free filet mignon sandwiches while you drink. The sandwiches are served sporadically over the course of the happy hour, and some servers are strict about handing out only one at a time, so don't count on a dinner-size amount of free food. If you're really hungry, you can order some additional sides like their delicious french fries. The Happy Hour is offered both in the bar and the restaurant. We visited the bar, but I found it a bit dark. We'll probably sit in the restaurant bar area next time. Guys should note that there is a dress code of pants and closed shoes. My husband was wearing shorts and sandals on our visit and was able to stay, but was asked to dress more appropriately on our next visit

Heartbreakingly inconsistent. I was staying in the Presidential Suite of the hotel in which this restaurant resides. Had a fine dinner for four with wine by the glass and light alcohol totaling $700 (with an additional $300 gratuity, on top of the gratuity) one night. We were close to home (hotel) so returned the following night.On night 2, the wheels positively came off the bus!! Appetizers came profoundly undercooked The cooked appetizers were raw and my wife's tomato salad was so ripe it was spoiled and smothered in blue cheese to hide the rot of the fruit. Vigorous handwaving to attract the attention of waiters who are standing in an empty restaurant checking their iPhones (this pattern occurs over and over).. We complain, we send said undercooked and spoiled food back. They correct the error but the food looks half eaten on it's return. Then our mains come.. EVERYTHING is wrong. Filet ground burgers for the children which we politely and directly said, at the outset "We would like to have well done and don't want to send back" came medium rare. Another steak ordered rare is overcooked and the vegetables seem wilted. Things are so bad that we think the kitchen is "screwing with us" because we complained about the appetizers. I hail the restaurant manager Seth who was just terrific and regal on an introductory meet and greet of cordial "Hello's", but who now seems flustered and less than capable or sincere when a real problem is presented. We try to reassure him that we are trying to be constructive (we eat out 300 nights a year) and this isn't acceptable. He diligently waits for our food - which finally comes out of synch with everything else (near dessert time) and we are served the full check without any kind of courtesy or financial accommodation.Terrible service - terrible experience. No courtesy to its guests and a restaurant manager who should be shamed to the greeting position at the local Applebys for his complete insincerity and inability to take any form of action. We are young, rich and will absolutely never return to Morton's in Singapore. Further I will see to it that this restaurant will miss on tens of thousands of dollars in 2013 as recurrent business relating to our personal private bank and affairs in this city are booked elsewhere. Lesson learned -- Good riddance -- and a hearty piece of disrespect thrown back at you "Morton's Singapore" for the disrespect shown to me and my family on the night we attended
5
If you have a big appetite like me (and are not a vegetarian) you will absolutely love it here - this is the place to come for high-quality meat (and lots of it!)... if I could afford it (and wasn't already overweight) I would eat everyday - perfection
5
It was well worth taking out that 2nd mortgage on my home to devour Morton's fillet steak. The meat was seasoned perfectly. There was nothing to hide or disguise about this high quality cut of meat. All their meat is imported USDA Prime-Aged beef. Being the cynic I am, I ordered peppercorn sauce on the side, but I didn't use it. I just couldn't tarnish the flavor of this beautiful cut of meat. Creamed spinach was dreamy. Bread was just okay. Service was excellent. Appreciate the attention to detail and the fact that they only clear your plate once everybody is done.Meat was expertly grilled. Not a single complaint from the four hungry, experienced carnivores in our party. Great spot for a business lunch or dinner. Lots of testosterone. Very Chicago/NYC steakhouse "Al Capone" could eat here, feel. I will try Wolfgang Puck's Cut next time now that I have the ultimate benchmark.Great wine-list. Hope to return. Make a reservation
4
I went here for a business dinner. Lots of pluses:The bread served was great and that is not easy to find in SIngapore. A nice round chunk of crusty bread we could each carve up.I had the tomato salad: Very juicy and well seasoned. Delicious start to the meal.The waiter served us well but struggled when I wanted to drink my Asahi beer 'by the neck'. It was already 1/2 in the glass before he realised ...The steak was awesome. The waiter checked carefully how we wanted it cooked and it arrived perfectly cooked and delicious. Only challenge was to finish it as it was so large!The desserts looked great and were also huge. I would have tried some but the steak had already finished me off.I'll go back and try the desserts next time
4
Had a great meal experince at Mortons. Food was great, Service was great. We went there knowing about the cost so we came prepared. I have to say that the steak was one of the best that I have had in a long time. And they offer regular water so you don't have to worry about the "sparkling or still" line
4
I had Morton in Chicago several years ago and the experience in Singapore last year was just as good. If you crave for good steak and don't mind the price, you won't be disappointed. The sitting isn't huge so you may want to book in advance. I believe it's a popular dinner restaurant for business.
2
I really loved Morton's and we made it our favorite place for celebrating birthdays. I loved their attentiveness, deco, and the food. Last night I had to realize Morton's has lost most of it. No special welcome to the birthday child, pathetic deco on the table, just the personalised menu was there. Ordered champagne, which was flat. Talked to the waitress and she told me the manager would come. 10 min later the waitress came back and said that the champagne is fresh from a new bottle. How bad is this. Ordered lobster cocktail as appetizer, which was ok but nit spectacular. The steaks were divine, that's what saved the evening and the chocolate soufflÃ©, but the mashed potatoes were so unbelievable tasteless and not creamy. Overall that was probably the last time we went there. Really sad to see this happen, but with such bad service I am nit willing to pay such high prices
2
This place prides itself on its steaks and seems to get great reviews although having eaten there twice now (there won't be a third time) I can only say that other diners either believe the hype and/or don't know a good steak.Steaks are bland basically and a bit tough. I can only surmise that they don't know how to season and then cook a steak correctly which really isn't that difficult to get right.1. Ensure meat at room temperature before you start frying / grilling2. Use plenty of salt (ideally smoked sea salt) to season and use a high heat throughout (turning frequently)3. Allow to stand for 5 minutes before serving so that plate isn't swimming in meat juices when it's put in front of youWine list is also super expensive even by Singapore standards.In summary, very expensive but very poor. If you like and enjoy good steaks - go elsewhere.
4
The service was top notch and the wine list is excellent (unless you want Spanish wine). Steaks were USDA - just what I was looking for after three months in China! The flavor of the steak wasn't the best I've had from Morton's but it was good. AND they have the bar bite menu which is so reasonable...if you want good food at cheap Sing prices, that's the menu for you.I'll be going back this week...it feels like the Morton's I've always known in the US. :
2
Service was inattentive.
Bisque was overly alcohol infused.
Burger which you have to ask for is really good. Crab cakes one of the best.
Overall. Really over priced for poor service and slightly above average food
5
food was delicious excellent quality and actually not bad value for money. best desserts and waitress service in Singapore
5
We went to Morton's to celebrate our wedding anniversary having been to their Denver restaurant two years previously. Staff went out of their way to make it a special occasion, providing personalized menus and a photo. The food was excellent, the steaks as good as we remembered and cooked exactly as stated. The chocolate soufflé desert was excellent although not much room left after the steaks! Their wine list is extensive albeit pricey.We can't praise them enough for making our evening truly special. It's not cheap as others have pointed out but as a rare treat its well worth it
5
Finally had the opportunity to visit Morton's Singapore. Was so looking forward to the food, but ended up being totally blown-off by the exemplary services from Zack, our attendant-of-the-night.Having read so much online reviews, we went for the usual Crab Cakes and Steaks, but for a change, we ordered Tomato beefsteak with Blue cheese for salads. Man! The tomato slices are HUGE! And more importantly, the tomatoes did not squirm into a pile of mess when cut. And the taste, oh... It's just so heavenly! To me, the Tomato was definitely much better than the overrated Crab Cakes! Just need to watch out for the equally excessive blue cheese that might have been a tad bit too strong for the locals.We had Double Cut New York Strip and Filet Mignon. Bad choice to take Double Cut, because by then, we were pretty much full, not forgetting that we need to save some space for Hot Chocolate Cake ... But as said, what impressed us most was the impeccable services by Zack. Not only did he exhibit strong knowledge on all food items, he was also able to provide excellent recommendation in regard to food & wine pairing. Not forgetting his good sense of humor and cheerfulness, it really made our evening so much more lively!Do take note that the restaurant is pretty "lively", to the extend of noisy at times. So it may not be the best option for someone who prefers a quieter evening ..

have been dining at Moretons for years, however the sudden influx of steakhouses in sg over the past two years, there are now better options in my opinion. Steaks are still great big portions, however the rib-eye I had was better on previous occassions, quality of the beef was definately different. My friends and I still enjoyed it, however having dined at other steakhouses recently, I would say Moreton is slightly lagging now
3
After 2 months stuck on a job in N Sulawesi with no western food, I decided to treat myself while on a short break in Singapore. Took a seat in the bar and ordered the NY strip cooked medium rare. I ordered the smaller size, still an ample 14oz. The beast arrived and I have to say it was cooked correctly. But, and for me its a big "but", the flavour just wasn't there.........at all. Don't get me wrong, its a good steak. But this is top dollar by any standards and for this money the meat should have that magic that great steaks deliver. Won't be going back any time soon, you can have this quality elsewhere at a much lower cost
5
Morton's has been in Singapore for quite some time now. I first visited Morton's Singapore almost 10 years ago. I had just moved back to Singapore and had visited the mothership in Chicago a year before moving to Singapore. I was impressed and relieved that I would be able to find properly aged and portioned USDA steaks if I ever needed a fix without the price of a ticket all the way to Chicago.I recently visited again and I have to commend the fine folks that manage Morton's Singapore on keeping what works and not messing with what works. It's a steakhouse. It is therefore reasonable to assume that it should all be about the meat. The menu is mercifully short. The menu gets fancy or too lengthy at a steakhouse and the first thing to go is quality.I thoroughly enjoyed my rare NY strip. No accoutrements. Just a finely wet-aged hunk of USDA beef. I'm no vegetarian, but I do believe that eating meat selectively is a good thing. And that when you do, it has to be the very best. You humbly acknowledge the sacrifice of the fine beast and are filled with appreciation for the expertise and respect for the product that went into properly aging this precious meat. All this activity culminating in the moment of truth when you place that first flavorful morsel in your mouth.I don't have specific recommendations. I will just say that although there is a selection of Australian and USDA steaks, I am partial to the USDA and make the trip to Morton's only because Morton's can do justice to this fine product
5
Yes, Morton’s is an old favorite in Singapore; yes portions and costs are at the top end. Most of the reviews say it. “Terrific place, but pricy” is a common refrain. Now there’s a great way to enjoy a “Morton’s experience light”….Same terrific service and friendly staff but avoid the massive portions you can never finish and the whopper of a bill by visiting during happy hour. From 5-7, you can enjoy discounts on certain drinks and foods from their bar menu PLUS free steak sandwiches. Yes that’s free! I’m shocked that it’s not packed to the rafters every day considering the level of service and cost savings….did I say FREE steak sandwiches :-)Great idea Morton’s
5
Ate here one evening with some colleagues. The service was excellent and the steak to die for! Be warned, the steaks are pretty big but they do some "smaller" ones also. Think twice about a starter as there are some excellent desserts to follow! Would definitely recommend this for a great steak in Singapore
5
Got invited to this place for a friends birthday party. I was probably the only person in the whole restaurant who actually had no idea where he was.At first hand the prices looked ridiculously high, far too much for a piece of meat - wether it's a good piece or a really really very good piece. However as the night progressed I started to understand that it's not only the meat, but the whole experience what makes this place worthwhile. The best steak i've eaten in ages, fantastic service.I was glad I didn't had to pick up the check though
5
Mortons is the place for A++ steaks in Singapore. Huge ,perfectly cooked Australian , US beef. Great sides , Amazing wine list. Nice subdued lighting. Great staff , never keep you waiting.
But you are going to pay for it.
4
Once in a year thing, given its price tag. If money is not an issue, this would be the place to impress your date. Great atmosphere, steaks cooked to perfection and wonderful wine.
3
I enjoyed the food, but it wasn't too special. The wine list is prohibitively expensive, and the food is also overpriced. But the service is good (for Singapore) and I really like the ambience.
4
This has been an old favorite for many years and we recently re-visited them after a good 3 -4 years absence to celebrate a birthday. Lets get the bad bits out of the way - and there is only one - which is the price. A meal at Mortons has always been pricey and it has incredulously actually gone up further. If the price point of at least a $100 for the smallest steak in the restaurant does not faze you and once you have accepted the fact that this meal is going to be a splurge, then this is without doubt a restaurant worth going to, especially for the carnivores out there. Ambience - regal, formal and yet charming. Wonderfully suited for a special evening out - whether its with friends, business associates or just a family dinner. The warm, earthy tones used in the decor of this place makes it feel relaxing, and non-stuffy unlike many fine dining restaurants.Service - nothing less than perfect. Probably one of the best service in Singapore. This restaurant has always had fantastic staff and its very pleasant to find that after many years, standards have not dropped. Attentive, passionate about their food, and a commendable balance of quiet efficiency and warm casual chatter.Food - portions of everything is huge here for Singapore standards but even though we knew we would be stuffed silly, it is still difficult to keep ourselves from ordering appetizers and sides. This round we had the crabcake for starters, which is highly recommended. The steaks as always were done to perfection. We definitely did not need to order a side dish as just the steak alone would have been more than sufficient but couldn't help ourselves to the mash potatoes, which again is simply great. We had no more room to eat but had to order dessert and this is the reason why we love Mortons. Every part of the meal from starters, to sides to desserts is a high note on its own and while its a steakhouse, there is no part of the meal that is a disappointment and in fact, just when you think that it was the best steak you had, wait till you order the legendary hot chocolate cake. Beats most dessert houses hands down.As it was a birthday celebration, the menu was specially printed, the dessert was on the house and to top it off, we were given a polaroid photo together with a card from Mortons, signed by the waiter assigned to the table. Tiny gestures - but a perfect way to end the evening.If you are looking for a place that you can confidently rely on for a special evening, look no further
5
An evening at Mortons was a special birthday treat, and what a treat! For starters we chose a tomato salad and the shrimp. Wonderful flavours. For main course I had the chicken (3 large flattened chicken breasts) in a subtle garlic sauce which was delicious, and my Partner (the meat eater) had the fillet steak. He said it was without doubt the best steak he has ever eaten. We thought we wouldn't have room for dessert, but they had a "chocolate souffle for 2" on their menu, and as it was a birthday treat, they said it was on the house! I was so shocked by this wonderful gesture. They even piped Happy Birthday on the plate in chocolate sauce. And ... it tasted great. So light and delicate, the perfect end to a perfect meal. Highly recommended, and we would come again when in Singapore. Do note that it is expensive, but sometimes you do get what you pay for
5
I've consistently had excellent meals, excellent service and a great time on every visit. Make no mistake, it will cost a bomb, especially if you want alcohol (of course, alcohol in Singapore generally makes every place you could eat expensive very quickly). I go here for special occasions and highly recommend it for same. Staff are very friendly and knowledgeable about the menu. Oh yeah, expect to need to take a doggy bag full of the part of the meal you couldn't finish back home, these guys don't subscribe to the expensive restaurant = tiny portions idea. Love it
5
The challenge to find a restaurant in Singapore with both exemplary service and food quality / consistency is often futile. Good news for visitors, locals & expats alike is that Morton's offers excellent quality (air flown) meals with consistent, gracious service. As a family, we choose to enjoy Morton's as a birthday tradition and we have always left satisfied and happy. I would recommend Morton's in Singapore for anyone looking for a great meal but also an experience that reminds you of how great restaurants should operate. Other restaurants in Singapore simply can not compare. MBS is beautiful but even with the arrival of celebrity chefs and service training personnel, Morton's exceeds in every way
4
If it is meat you want, then this is the place to go.For me, the meat was a little undercooked but nothing the chef couldn't handle the second time round. Salad was good and by the end of my evening, I could hardly get up. I was F U L L to say the least.An overall good impression
4
My biggest problem at Morton's is choosing between the Lobster Bisque and the Crab cakes for a starter. Along with the outstanding selection of Steaks are wonderful sides... I recommend Morton's for any kind of outing, from a Business meal to a night out with your boyfriend
5
We go regularly to Mortons and that's because you always know what you're getting. Top class produce cooked to perfection with the most impeccable of service. It's a tried and trusted formula and the restaurant has a great vibe also.Go and be impressed but be warned, it is not cheap. You get what you pay for however. If there was one small gripe, the wine list could do with a little more depth in terms of the vintages but that's about the only thing. Top class
2
What's happened? Someone said all the old staff have moved on. The service was awful, our steak was overcooked and tasteless, the souffle was floury and rubbery. Please don't ask me to any more dinners there!
3
I have visited Morton's before on several occasions in the US.
Pleasant ambience and efficient staff.
Whilst the standard of the meals were fine the value is not there. A steak at S$100.
I have had better at half the price
5
Steaks and seafood flown in from the US. The usual Morton's menu, but always excellent. Service is consistently excellent. Call ahead for reservations. Excellent wine list.
5
If you want a proper feeling that you are in the US rather than in Singapore, you must try the Morton's Steak House.
It really feels that you are in Houston or Boston since everything works like back there.
5
We were met by name at the front of the restaurant. For our anniversary they had prepared personalized menus. The blue cheese salad wedge for starter was just OK but my wife enjoyed her Tuna tartare.You go to Mortons for the steaks and my double cut Fillet Mignon was amazing. I love steak and this is the best steak I've had outside the USA. They made our anniversary dinner experience very special and I would definitely go back again for a special occasion.
5
Service: Always good. What I particularly love is that they serve your steak, then the staff make it an absolute point to come back just 1 minute after everyone has had their first bite to double check the steak is served as requested (ie, if you order "medium rare" then you got a "medium rare"). I love that these guys do this religiously. Have been to this restaurant at least 20 times - only twice has my steak been overdone ("medium" rather than "medium rare") and each time without question they replace it with a fresh steak super quickly. Bravo for service which puts the customer first every time. They do this a little better at Mortons (when compared to Cut).Food: Awesome. For starters the jumbo lump crab and the prawn cocktail rock. All food is served very simply with a focus on the fresh ingredients (Cut is probably a little more technique driven). My favourite steak is the Cajun Ribeye - if you have not tried it, just do it, the spice rub is epic. The portions are huge. No one will ever leave this place feeling like "they did not get enough food but paid a lot". Nothing is worse than paying premium prices and leaving hungry, but that will never happen at Mortons. Compared to Cut, Morton's steaks are definitely larger and Morton's appetizers are definitely larger than Cut appetizers.Ambience: Great steakhouse ambiance, wood panelling, the staff come around and present the different cuts of steak. Properly done.Prices are obviously expensive, but I've never left here unhappy or feeling like I didn't get what I paid for

Celebrated a friend's birthday and enjoyed every moment. Ambience was nice and cosy. Table seating was just perfect. Waiting staff were professional & friendly. Though restaurant was packed, we had no slightest problem with the attention showered on us by every waiter the moment we stepped in. Food was plentiful, large portion & cooked to perfection. We had cold Alaskan King Crab legs, 3 different cuts of steaks (filet mignon, ribeye & poterhouse). Maybe a little expensive
4
the place is cramped and the place is almost always full. better make reservations if you don't want to be disappointed. the steaks are a bit pricy (compared to other good steak joints) but the quality of food is unparalleled. portions are huge and most salads are to share
2
Some colleagues took me to Morton's on a Friday night, after bragging about how good the steaks were. Bit of a queue to get a table, but good after work buzz and nice cold Tigers helped set the scene.The menus eventually came and I have never seen such expensive steaks. Even by Tokyo standards this place is horrendously expensive. I chose the least-worst option, it was pretty good, but my bill alone was $125. Not to be repeated
4
Admittedly, it is not exactly an inexpensive place to eat at. But for Singapore standards, and for the quality of meat, service and overall experience, it is worth the money. Their Martini selection is very cool and their "Center Cut" tenderloin is remarkable. Rservations are advisable; we were lucky to get a table as walk-in guests
4
Stands up well to the newer competition, this steak house veteran is still an excellent choice for a great meal. A little expensive but not absurdly so and the food is always great. Steaks cooked perfectly. They also have an extensive wine list.
5
Best steak I've had in years, but like all Morton's it comes at a high price. Located near the 'downtown' area, it's a great place to enjoy a luxurious meal and walk it off around Marina Bay.
4
It's a New York style restaurant with very high quality food, and prompt service. This was not fine dining however, the place was noisy and full of kids, and the pace was very pushy. And the bill was astronomical.
4
Serve great food and provide great service, but is bit pricy.
4
After our session our friends brought us to Morton's bar that serves martinis with different flavors from chocolate, apple, etc...The kicker is that they will serve steak sandwich all through the happy hour and you may eat as much as you want.We got there around 5:30 pm and the place was packed but managed to get a table and enjoyed our alcohol of choice, stories of past, present and future but above all the steak sandwich you can eat
5
It was our first visit and we were there to celebrate my bf's birthday. During reservation, they do ask if you are celebrating any occasion. They actually personalize our menu with a "Happy Birthday (name)" message and the date and you can bring home the menu as a souvenier of your visit. I thought it was really nice. Almost all the staff there wished him happy birthday as well.One table butler takes care of about 4 tables so they were really attentive. They took time to explain and recommend the items on the menu. It's our first time in a restaurant like this and I was a little overwhelmed by the great service. We ordered the morton's salad, double cut fillet mignon and a brussels sprout side dish to share. They offered to portion out our steak for us without us asking. As we were celebrating birthday, we get to pick a dessert of our choice (crime brûlée) and it was on the house. I loved all the dished that we ordered. Morton's salad is a blue cheese dressing salad but the blue cheese was not overwhelming at all. Our medium rare steak was cooked to perfection thought he did find the seasoning just a tad salty. The double cut is really value for money! Single cut about 250g is $90 and the double cut about 350-400g is $99. If it's your first time just wanting to try out the standard of the steak, the double cut fillet mignon is definitely a good choice. We saw other people's orders for seafood and such and it all looked so yummy.It being our first visit, we were presented with a gift card of $100 off minimum $300 bill on our next visit. On top of that, they also helped us take a picture and developed it for us and presented it to us in a "card". All these little gestures were really unexpected and really added to the whole experience and end off our dinner on a great note. We wil definitely return but maybe on a special occasion only because though service is great, the price is really something one has to consider unless you really have loads of money to spare :)Oh just a note for those who wants to visit, this is not a fine dining restaurant
4
Morton's is a restaurant we visit once or twice a year on special occasions. Prices have risen, and we do notice. However, the food is very well cooked and steaks are, in our opinion, the best in town. Service is efficient and pleasant enough. So we will keep coming back. Have started saving for next visit already
4
Staff are great...exactly what a steak place should be, good crowd, excellent beef, one of the best wine lists in town.....and please if you rate the place dont complain about prices.....! there are lots of cheap steak places in town...and they tast cheap and treat you cheap!!! Been going here for 7 years...and Mortona dn Lugers in NYC when I lived there..Lugers or possibly the Palm can give Mortons a run for the mone

This restaurant serves brilliant steaks as the title suggests but it is very pricy. I've tried some classic steaks, huge steaks, stuffed potatoes, Morten's Prime Ocean. Service is not very consistent. Went there twice, one time good and one time, staff didn't smile at all; waiter took order and went away without thank! For what I paid and service delivered it not worth money. I would expect it would be a whole lot nicer regarding ambiance and service but nothing really impress me much
4
This is an old favourite in Singapore, but only my first outing. Had been meaning to go for a long time, as this is THE steak destination in SIngapore. Well, probably not anymore as Wolfgang Puck has opened CUT, and the steak there is better in my view. I did enjoy Morton's, the service was good, the salads were legendary, (good blue cheese sauce! - taking the health outta salad!) and the steaks were very decent, but its super expensive, on par with CUT and i think i would prefer that. We went on a Monday night, and it was still pretty busy, a testament to the good quality of the beef
5
Love the service and the meal preparation here.. also the details they add to the presentation
5
regular visitor to Mortons.
never a dissapointment,
always good.
Good food and service,
slightly expensive!
4
Very good meat, and cooked very well, great service and very kind staff, the price is quite high, but is good for the quality that is offered. Clean, comfortable restaurant, recommended.
4
Been to many of these in the US, always the same, good quality service and food.
Been the Singaporean version here and also very good.
Shrimp Alexander is my favourite as is the Fillet Mignon followed by the Key Lime Pie...if you have room..... :)
3
my dad literally got angry eating their steak. BAD. He ordered the expensive steak, it was tough.
5
We frequent Morton's for any chance to celebrate - whether its a birthday, mother's day, a promotion or any excuse for a celebration. Our favourite is the Porterhouse, oysters, beefeater tomatoes salad with blue cheese and chocolate larva cake. The porterhouse is enough for two people to share. We bring our little girl who enjoys the chicken fingers and fries. It's not cheap but you can never go wrong at Morton's when it comes to a special celebration
4
loved the steak but expensive and didn't really like the fact that I had to separately select my own potatoe variety and vegetables instead of getting a recommended complement without having to pay more and more. But then again it's about the steak and they were out of this world. will take a while before i go bac

We went there yesterday for Martini Happy Hour.The Morton bar is so popular that, you have to reach there before 5:30 on Friday, otherwise need to wait until 8pm to get it. They have several martini - apple, chocolate, cosimo, lychee etc martini are in discount before 7pm, and nice beef steak sandwich provided free. From 8pm, there is late night offer - discount steak burger as well as Heineken.Very nice environment and super nice martini, really good for friends gathering
5
Loved it. They called me to ask if this was a special event, which I told them. We came ans sat down, the menu had been printed Happy Wedding anniversary. My was was quite impressed.I'm big fan of steaks and this was one of teh best. Problem is I cant decide if I like this or CUT more. I guess they are both equally very special steakhouses. Although I think the wines at Mortons are slightly more friendly priced. Wine corkage fee was $60 as we brought our own wine
5
We very much enjoyed our dinner at Morton's Singapore. We ordered the wedge salad to share (the waitress suggested we share rather than each take our own; much appreciated), each had a rib-eye steak and a tenderloin medallion (more than $90++each) and shared a chocolate soufflé. No side orders. We were stuffed! The steaks were cooked perfectly......very tasty and tender. The wait staff was extremely professional and very informative.
5
One of the best steak places in Singapore. They actually prepare the steak the way you like and the food arrives still warm and looking fresh from the range. Pricey but worth it.
3
Expensive. The food and service was good, but everything was charged, the cuts come with no sides. Can find better steak for less.
2
If staff bother to learn parrot fashion the BS on the meat selection i suggest they learn a bit more to enable them to answer basic questions. Full of noise due to the low roof and a place to be seen, its not for a pleasant dining experience. Foods ok though.
5
Morton's certainly deserves 'the best steak' in Singapore award, after many of visits over the past years it is consistently high quality food and if you really want to try properly aged beef then this is the place and you will find it hard to be disappointed. Be aware and ready to bring your credit cards, the quality and feast come at a price and almost everything is in addition to the price of the steak. Although you may come away having had the best steak in Singapore it may well also be the most expensive you'll ever have. If you also happened to bring along someone that is not so inclined to having a meal of red meat you may wish to warn there are limited alternative options
3
Expense account dining at its fullest. THis place is expensive, but service is good, and meal portions are generous, Mortons, loves BIG portions, and you leave feeling like you have swallowed half a cow, even on the small portions. Desserts could feed a small family in India for a month, especially the supersized carrot cake, which is obsene in its size
5
Was taken to this restaurant as a special treat last night - and wowee!! The service was fantastic - the food superb - and over all experience WONDERFUL!The steaks on the main menu are massive - so if you fancy something slightly smaller (still around 240g!) ask for the 'small menu' (also known as steak & seafood menu) - you get a lovely salad, fillet steak, a choice of prawns of scallops and a side! So still a massive meal! I had scallops with mine which were gorgeous. And the baked potato side was also huge so shared with husband (who was consuming half a cow on the regular menu!).We were encouraged by our lovely friend to end with the 'souffle for 2' - WOWEE! Turned up and looked MASSIVE - but we ate every scrap - was one of the top 3 desserts I have ever had anywhere in the world!Definitly recomend this place for a special evening
5
This restaurant serves brilliant steaks as the title suggests, it is a bit pricy, but worth it if you want some classic steaks, huge steaks, stuffed potatos and seriously huge entrees this is for you.Oh yes, it does have other things on the menu and cocktails don't hurt eitherLocated at a large hotel, this is part of a chain from the U.S, that i am not familiar with. (I should qualify this by saying we had just spend 3 weeks in Delhi and were craving a good steak
4
I don't like beef so I ordered lobster. It's really fresh and very tasty. My husband ordered a steak but he felt that the steak was somewhat over-rated. Onion bread was soft and nice but it like a kind of bread in the supermarket. Service is good but you will pay for that
2
Have you heard of the "Book of Morton's". In this guide the Morton's head honchos use on their staff and minions. theres stuff like - you are the chosen ones because we hired you, you have Slys body, Ashton' look and Sinatra's charm. You must patronize the customer by being cocky, insensitive and even rude. Your indolent attitude must be shown for all the mortonions to see. Think this is strong stuff. It's the truth. It's happened to me time and time again in different Morton's. But the Singapore one takes the cake. A one and a half hour wait after having a booking, with no apology from the Brit or Ozzy manager who just said they were pretty backed up. This followed by the cheeky, superior comments from the waitstaff and heavy steak at 11 pm. Paid the bill and realized I've been robbed and then thanked the robbers for it. Oh, by the way, the bread was great, as were the steaks and the chocolate fondant that I was warned repeatedly would take half an hour and to order it along with the mains. Just didn't enjoy the experience.

We had dinner at Morton's while we were staying at The Mandarin. The restaurant is very busy, and quite noisy. It does have a very nice lively atmosphere but I don't think it would be a good place for a quiet romantic evening! We were first served onion bread, which we both found of poor quality, like cheap american supermarket bread. We didn't order starters when we saw the size of the steaks portions on offer. My husband ordered a piece of Australian beef, I ordered the US one. Mine was good, more flavorful and more tender than my husband's. It was good quality but too expensive for what it was. If it had been dry aged, it would have been even better and probably worth the expense. The portions were huge, one steak would have been enough for the both of us. We didn't think of asking if we could share one. We ordered a side dish of potatoes lyonnaise and one creamed spinach. Although the side dishes were hefty portions, S$23.00 for spinach is not justifiable. They should reduce the size of the portions along with the price! The spinach portion we had would have been more than enough for 4 adults with normal appetites. The wine card had very limited selection of half bottles, not every couple can manage a full bottle between them. We didn't order dessert, we were too full. We will look for other steak houses in Singapore, next time we feel like eating a big slab of meat

Mortons is the genuine thing for martinis steaks and wine.
Great service - really good food - and yes do stop by at the upstairs martini bar before you visit - fun and crowded during happy hour.
5
Start from the fresh baked onion bread, to starter lobster cocktail, to main juicy steak, with fantastic sides and to dessert new york cheese cake etc.... my night is full of hapiness... Excellent service and wine waiter... Everything is just perfect... Must Try!!!
4
The best service and the best steak. Had both the steak sandwich at the bar with their famous martinis and on another ocassion had the steak in the restaurant. Out of this world. But very pricy.
5
Had the best steak ever.
Thumbs up for their service

We made a reservation for dinner through OpenTable, and we were shown to a booth in a romantic location at the back of the restaurant. Our waiter was very friendly and helpful without being intrusive. The onion bread was good, but we have had better kinds of bread at other steakhouses. We shared everything. We were surprised that they split our order of lobster bisque into two bowls that both seemed quite full. There was more lobster meat in each bowl than we have had in a lobster bisque before, and there was a spicy aftertaste, which tasted very good. We split a glass of Noble One botrytis Semillon wine, and again, each of us had a full-looking glass. Our single cut petite filet was more than enough to share. It was slightly tougher than at some other steak houses where we have eaten. As we cut with the knife, we could see the strings of beef fall away from the main cut under the blade. Every bite was acceptably tender except the very last bite of my half of the steak which had to go back on the plate because it was so tough. We shared a mashed potato side dish, and we ate only a bit more than half of it because there was so much. Sadly, we were so full that we had to skip the cold desserts (we would have had to pre-order warm desserts such as souffle). We wanted to shop in the Marina Square mall afterward, and the waiter showed us a back way through one of the restaurant’s function rooms to the mall. Morton’s did not provide the best steak we have ever had, but it was tasty enough so that we would recommend it to good friends for very good special-occasion food, service, and atmosphere in the Marina area. The bill was pretty high, but it was matched by the quantity and quality
3
i don't think the words "steak house" should be part of this name. Morton's is fine without the steak. it is a good european cuisine place, with fine european (less the beef) food! I like the ambience and service, but the steak itself sucks. do note that the food ratings below does not include the rating for steak, like i said the rating of steak is not even on the rating list, it is ZERO. the worst steak i ever had. And to someone eating at Gordon Grill and Raffles Grill, this steak is n o good at all!!!
4
as the name suggests, steak is the highlight of any visit to this restaurant. other than that, crab cakes are always a hit and lobster too. the vegetable options could be a little less decadent (creamed spinach, baked potatoes) considering how rich everything else is. the soufflés are delicious.

When I attended the Singapore Air Show in February I invited customers to dinner at Morton's Steakhouse, located in the Mandarin Oriental Hotel. My customers were delighted with the experience! I was not surprized.I am a VIP with Morton's and I have visited about 20 Morton's in 2011 alone. Most of the Morton's are located in the United States. I value the restaurant for consistency and quality at each location. For the most part all locations are pretty close in service and quality of the food. Singapore was no exception. Except it may have been even better than I expected.The service was exceptional. It was gratifying that the wine list was extensive, with affordable wines included. The menu was typical Morton's. This is a steakhouse folks. DO NOT ORDER FISH! I had the bone in ribeye, and I was not disappointed. If you have not had a Morton's ribeye, then you cannot be a judge of fine steaks. Others in the grop had filets or New Yorks. All loved their steaks. I also dined at the Raffles Long Bar Steakhouse later in the week, and I was thoroughly disappointed in the product. The prices were about the same, but the quality and the experience at Raffles Long Bar Steakhouse was very disappointing. The Long Bar Steakhouse steaks were similar to Denny's breakfast steaks. No kidding! I strongly recommend Morton's if you are looking for steaks while in Singapore
5
Food tasted:1st: Garlic Bread: very crusty, fresh and filling! Bread was as big as my face!!2nd: Jumbo Baked Potato ($19): very normal I would say. 3rd: Morton's Prime Ocean Platter for two, Baked ($85): SPECTACULAR! Crab cake was fantastic. 4th: Ribeye steak, USDA Prime ($97) - feel that Bedrock's steak is more succulent. Felt the steak was a tad dry..and not marinated/ seasoned enough.5th: Morton's Chocolate Cake (complimentary): The usual rich chocolate molten lava cake. =) Customised Birthday Menu=) Complimentary Photograph with Card=) Complimentary Dessert!=) Great service! Total damage including GST & Service Charges: S$236.58Feel the steak at Bedrock is better than Morton's. But I think this is individual preference.For very occasional dining

Everyone in the family are beef lovers except me. But still, we decided to visit Morton's on my dad's birthday.According to them, the steak was wonderful. Quite a big portion, so they ordered 1 to share. Onion rings not to our liking. As i don't take beef, i ordered scallops with ham. Scallops are fresh but a bit tasteless.Service was great. Every now and then they will check on you, see if you are happy/satisfied with your order. I have a 4yr old with me, so i actually brought outside food into Morton's as dinner for my son. I thought they would make a fuss as 'No outside food allowed' policy is probably stricter at all these places but no, i was wrong. They did not say anything about it when i was feeding my son. I think they do understand that there's nothing much on the menu for a 4yr old kid.Highlight of the dinner was the chocolate cake for me. If i were to go back, it'll just be for the cake and nothing else
5
This spot may be a little pricey but d quality n service is excellent,
5
Just amazing, best steaks in the Far East. Not little steaks, either, but the real deal.
2
Nice place...but OMG is it super super expensive~!!!
5
Mortons is widely acclaimed for great Steak; the added service & attention was greatly appreciated. 4 managers on the floor really working to be sure diners were VERY happy. I started with the chopped salad served with blue cheese dressing--fresh & tasty but nore than I could eat. My "smaller size" NY Strip was still BIG & perfectly medium rare. The steak fries are outstanding--each one beeter than the previous fry. Overall a superb meal. Good size wine pour by the glass & an impressive selection
5
Amazing service, ambience and consistently great food! We always order the Prime Rib before hand and they only have it twice a week. Perfectly cooked every single time. Other favorite would be the lobster. It is nicely cooked with a yummy butter sauce that leaves you yearning for more. Finally, although am not a huge dessert fan, but it's molten chocolate cakes are to die for. Would always go back there for some great comfort food. Perfect for social gatherings and/or romantic dinners. :

My wife & I had to try Singapore Morton's as we have had Hong Kong Morton's & loved that, this place is preety expensive but the steaks are good.To start off you get Onion flavoured bread which is really nice.I ordered Filet Mignon med rare & it was mouth water, cooked to perfection.Wife ordered lamb chops, very nice but really fatty.Side orders we got Mac Cheese & sauteed MushroomsDessert we ordered Souffle to share, was OKWith about 4 beers each the total bill was $312 Aus / $405 Singapor
4
Took my wife here for Valentine's day dinner.The service was good, the ambience was very good, the size of the servings was massive. The quality of the food - good. I've had better steak for less $$$ in my life time. The quality of the food simply doesn't justify the cost.Would I go there once in my life? Yes, just to see what it's like. Would I be a regular? Probably not

First of all, this review covers The Bar at Mortons, also known as The Martini Bar at Morton's. This is a smart casual location and is located in a small pavilion or a large gazebo right next to the restaurant proper. You can't miss it, it's right on the way to the restaurant which is where I first noticed the Bar; walking by it, admiring it and thinking it would a neat place to have drinks before dinner the next time.For about thirteen Singapore dollars you get a very respectable Martini. They'll do a Vesper if you prefer. The menu of worth a try" libations includes the citrusy and refreshing Cosmopolitan, the Lychee Martini which went three rounds at the table of giggling young professionals we were seated next to, and a chocolate-tini, which I never got to because it just felt too much like dessert.Happy hour starts at 5pm and you should get there as close to that as possible. It gets crowded pretty quickly and the place was pretty much packed by 6pm when I was there. Compliementary steak sandwiches which were as cute as they were tasty (read: small portions), make their debut at about 5:30pm and are served till 7pm. Other delectable comestibles such as the Blue Cheese Fries (blue cheese over steak fries) are also available but take a while, so be patient and enjoy your excellent martini.All in all, a thoroughly pleasant happy hour experience
5
My son: "I missed steak..I remember Morton's"The first visit to Morton's Singapore leave a very deep impression to him...friendly greeted by staffs..great menu intro & recommendation...the smokey beef, the appetizing colour, heavenly yum..yum yummy steaks ever and dont stop there..a photo shoot by attentive staffs...completed our dinner there..So..when we missed steaks in Singapore we remember Morgan's Steak Singapor
5
received several recommendations and decided to visit the place. the steak was very big (as far as I remember it was porterhouse) and extremely good. the service also - excellent. from negative expirience - it is pretty dark there, one of the visitors was very drunken and behaved himself strange :-), however, the personel made their best in order to calm him.overall, very good restauran
3
The steak is good. Was better. Price is still the same. Service is ok. Definitely a place worth bringing your girlfriend and mistress to, to impress, bed them, and starve for the rest of the month.
3
We were very excited to try Morton's having heard so much about it in the past. The steaks were good although the sides were way too salty. Overall, it was not worth the price. Waaay overpriced for the quality of food.
4
It is a great steakhouse but it is very pricey. good winelist. the pitch from the waiter is hilarious.
4
The steak is juicy and fresh. If you are on a budget, go between 5pm to 7pm on weekdays and order their martinis. It comes with complimentary beef sandwich, which is served to you every half hourly.
5
Perfect, not only probably one of the best steak houses in Singapore, but a great environment as well. Don't miss the Martini Bar outside of the resteraunt either!
5
This place has very good services, and they have good food as well. Its a great place to gather and discuss meetings in the private room or birthdays.
5
This bar offers great Martinis.. from dirty to lychee to the original ones. But Chocolate Martini is the best. They even serve free mini beef burgers during happy hours.. worth a visit but do go early as there wont be any seats left.
5
for the most awesome martinis in town, this is it! and whoever said martinis are for ladies obviously haven't been to mortons. happy hour from 5 - 7pm, with free steak sandwiches. tends to be full house, especially on fri nights, so we always make it a point to get there at 5 (no reservations).
4
I went there with a French friend who is a chef the first time and he ordered the food so it was great. We also discuss the products. no one knew he was a chef and they left us alone.The second time we went as a company. It was a get together and we wanted to try . The company boss booked a function room with 2 tables. We had great food and service.For the price they charged here, service better be great!;)They are famous for the steak but no chicken item but pheasant. As I do not take steak I had to take the pheasant during the first visit and a fish dish on the second. It was only ok for me. Perhaps, they are better at making steaks. The soup and desert were great.As the portion was huge, it could be shared by two persons. My colleagues had the lobster and it was great too.We did not order wines as it was very expensive. We suggest they have some reasonably priced wines as not everyone appreciate wine to pay an arm and a leg for it.Perhaps a house pour wine be good. Be prepared to pay at least $300 and more for 2 pax.It is good to try at least once and on special occasions. Service is really great! The only suggestion is when they are reading out the special for the day or recommending the products on that trolley, they may want to talk about it with more passion rather than rattling like a snake...on and on and on....with no commas and full stop. They may as well play it on a CD..smile.
5
Yes it's pricey. But it's well worth every cent, if you look at it as an experience to savour and remember, not just a meal. The service is top-notch: the staff are so well-trained they know how to give you just the right balance of attention and privacy, whether you're there for business or pleasure. The food is always excellent, portions are somewhat too big for me so I recommend sharing, not just the sides but even the mains. (A definite plus - nobody gives you a dirty look when you say you wanna share).If it's a special occasion like a birthday or anniversary, be sure to let them know when you make the reservation, and they'll do something special for you. Well worth saving up for - go ahead, splurge on Morton's when you want a treat
5
Service was impeccable. Steaks cooked to perfection. Portions were beyond generous. Worth the substantial price!!
5
Excellently cooked steak, very juicy and tender yet cooked to perfection. Very well trained waiter and very warm service. I had free cheesecake since it was my birthday. Definitely will come back when I crave for steak or for special occassion.
4
great steaks, very big, good food, great service.
5
ambience felt like i was in an old steakhouse somewhere in chicago very nice dim lighting.. steak were expensive but it was worth it! the grilled asparagus tasted so fresh and crunchy.. our very thoughtful and good looking waiter gave us a very lovely hot chocolate cake for our anniversary! will definitely comeback for mor
5
Service staff were very friendly and knowledgable in introducing the menu and different cuts of steak and selection of wine. Was served complimentary break which was warm and fresh. We ordered the crab cakes, ribeye steak, asparagus, fries, chocolate lava cake and a bottle of wine. The crab cakes were really good. Steak was very flavourful and the lava cake was to die for! Asparagus in my opinion were not very worth it since it was 5 stalks for $20 or $25. We couldnt finish the food. The portion of the steak is quite huge and if you are a small eater, you can order one portion and request for them to split into 2. That will give you more stomach space to try the appetizers and order more sides! Definitely a memorable experience and I would recommend it to anyone who wants to celebrate a special occasion to try
4
Meeting friend all staying at the MO after their delayed flight, had to adjust booking time twice; no problem.Very good steaks & desserts, extensive wine list, good service levels, great cocktails Yes its expensive, it is after all a top steak restaurant in a top end 5* hotel.....
3
Had a fantastic meal here a few years ago. The service is fantastic very good (but its very American and in your face it doesn't feel very geniune - a bit 'over the top'). Spent a fortune on dinner with a good friend of mine and don't get me wrong, it was a fantastic dinner but to be honest you can get great streak at a fraction of the cost elsewhere. I wouldn't be in a rush to go there again
5
I brought my wife and my family to Morton's to celebrate X'mas on the eve. They didn't have any special X'mas menu which was good and since it was Saturday we could try the prime rib (which is only available on Friday and Saturday). We got a private room too which was a bonus since the main dining area was a little noisy and we could really talk amongst ourselves without interruption. The only hindrance being in a room is that when you need service you need to go out and call someone but that only happened when we wanted to get the check. The food was excellent and I recommend trying a mixture of chilled and baked ocean platter as it has items like Alaskan Sea Crab Legs, scallops wrapped with bacon, prawns etc. The steaks we went for are the Prime Rib (which is the best, thick, juicy and tender), porterhouse steak for one and ribeye. All their steaks are great ad the porterhouse is huge, it is the size of the plate itself! But the prime rib is the best so if you are there early make sure you order it first and foremost because it goes fast! We had a few sides, steak fries, baked potato and grilled asparagus. The steak fries and baked potato are nothing new to describe but extremely delicious because the potatoes are from Idaho and huge. The baked potato skin looks like brown paper but when you eat it, it is very nice. The asparagus though I didn't really like because it was grilled with balsamic which I am not a fan of. Previous visit I had the steamed asparagus side dish which personally I felt was better. The service was excellent and our server Denise was funny, cheerful and able to recite the menu without reference and took our orders without a notepad. I have had steaks in a number of steakhouses in Singapore and everyone of them are good in their own right but Morton's is by the far the best

We a family of 4 went to Morton's to enjoy some good steaks. The steaks turned out to be ok , not really great . The side dishes were rather disappointing . The veggies were to salty and overcooked . But the price was however outrages , with only 2 glasses of wine and no desserts we paid over $ 600.- ! Don't borther , this restaurant is definetley overpriced for what it offers

You cant knock Morton's for the great food and giant portions. The service is top notch and at first glance it looks like any top class steak restaurant you would find in NYC. The ambiance is geared toward power broker meetings and classy cocktails. Food wise I give this location 5 stars.This is all ruined by the constant and non stop outbreaks of the "Happy Birthday" song which comes at an annoying frequency as to ruin any ability for you to hold a conversation let along to enjoy your food. Once or twice I get, but I have been for dinner here where a thunderous outbreak occurs almost every 15 minutes. This is highly disruptive if one were to be working on a "big business deal".I get it that people want to celebrate special moments at expensive restaurants...but there has to be a better (and perhaps more intimate) way of celebrating these events that doesn't great on everybody's nerves. I will go back...but recommend bringing ear plugs
2
While the steak is good, the service and cost do not match. There are much better places to each in Singapore. Think about how much you really want that steak first!!!

Had dinner twice in two days very recently. Both were equaliy good. Service impeccable. Without reservation, I was taken care off professionally. Steaks were awesome, matching wines by the glass were of good quality.
5
I know I can always get a great Steak at Morton's. My biggest problem is choosing between the Lobster Bisque and the Crab cakes for a starter. Along with the outstanding selection of Steaks are wonderful sides and an extensive wine list. You can count on a great meal and excellent service there as well. I recommend Morton's for any kind of outing from a Business meal to a night out with your favorite companion
4
Very good experience as the food is excellent tho' very pricey. The portion is huge and so it's sufficient for two to share. The dessert is unforgettably good. Service is attentive tho' I find the introduction section very long and draggy. But it's part of the whole experience
4
Top notch steaks, great starters and impeccable service, it's always a quality gig at Mortons. Only grouch is the wine list which is a) overpriced and b) suffering from a lack of great vintages.All in all you'll have a great time though and they happy to pack those enormous portions for you if you can't finish
5
We had visited Morton's before and had dinner there last night. Besides that fact that the dim lighting makes it difficult to navigate your way to the Restaurant and inside even more difficult to read a menu it is just a great place for steak. The debate will be, is it worth the money and the answer is, is a steak for half the price and lesser quality the same joy to eat? For us clearly, service and quality of food is excellent and worth the money

Saturday night at Mortons began with drinks at the bar.Qudos to Mike and the staff there! The drinks are great and the atmosphere in the bar was very relaxing, however then it was on to dinner. The restaurant itself has good decir, however as it was the weekend the noise level was very high and as this is an open plan seating arrangement did not lead itself to any form of casual comfortable conversation. I dont know about anyone else but I prefer not having to shout across a table to have a conversation with my husband. The server we had was mediocre at best. A very impersonable rambling as quickly as possible through the cuts of meat and dishes on hand . When we got to the food. The lobster bisque was excellent, however the crab cake was overall luke warm and cold in places.The mains were good - steak (although gristly and fatty in places) and salmon - however the spinach with mushrooms were incredibly salty . I didnt know anyone could do that to decent spinach.Garlic mash was excellent. Overall it's a decent restaurant but I wouldnt put it at the top of my list for great steak places or for a place to have a relaxing evening

I dined at Morton's this evening and am still in a Steak Coma as I type this review. Those that have complained in other reviews about it being too expensive should just eat someplace else instead of going to a place where you KNOW it's not going to be cheap and then whining about it. They've been around for decades doing the SAME thing: Morton's is a great place with outstanding steaks and you get what you pay for. For this meal, I had the crab cake appetizer, bone-in ribeye, asparagus w/ hollandaise sauce and creme brule. Everything was cooked to my liking, tasted great, and the service was fantastic throughout. No complaints, and when the bill came, I took it like a man and will even get a 5% rebate for using my Discover card. I was happy to have such a great steak, and will continue to dine at Morton's both here and in the States. Delicious

Been reading how fantastic Morton's has been in terms of service, food, atmosphere, hence I have decided to bring my wife to Morton's for our very first anniversary dinner in August 2011. Reserved our tables online via their website, which was foolproof to begin with. Arrived slightly earlier and was greeted heartily by the restaurant host (head waiter probably). Got seated at a small pathetic table next to liquor bottles and wasn't too happy at it first. I requested one of the waiter to move us to those cosy booths and it was granted within minutes. Ordered two entrees, a generous serving of the famous steak and wife had a seafood platter. Ordered a large bowl of brussel sprouts as well. On the whole, the food were nice (wouldn't say it blow us away) and up to expectations. As for ambiance, well, like some of the earlier reviews, I did noticed several patrons in jeans and some gals in those ultra shorts. So, do throw the notion out of the window that this place is a "formal attire only" restaurant. As for atmosphere, there were numerous tables with larger parties (friends, family, etc), hence it does not really give you a romantic setting that one would hope for. On the whole, I would recommend one to give a try at least once (for a special occasion)

I've been going to Morton's Singapore for years and the place has never stopped to please me and surprise me. Meat selection is top of the line, the food preparation is "Swiss-watch" precise and the side-dishes are so tasty to die for.The wine selection, except if one goes for eccentricity, basically meets each and every taste and so are the cocktails that the bar can make.Somebody had complaints about the service. Well in my case, as I am so picky, that's what made me coming through the years in first place. Have always been highly welcomed and perfectly attended to. Downside one may say is the price. Indeed, high end expensive but worth all the way
5
A must for steaks lover in Singapore.
Exceptional steaks - especially the USDA meats - tasty!
Good portion of food
Very knowledgeable sommerlier (Edwin Seow) with a great team of service member.
Downside - staff can over do it on up selling on food.
5
I have never had a steak like it! The staff were knowledgeable and attentive and explained the menu visually with the produce on a cart. I can't fault our dining experience and can do nothing but recommend this eatery. Enjoy,

Mortons Steak House, Mandarin Hotel Singapore.If your cozy with paying about SG100 for your dinner plate, then you will be rewarded with a mouth watering, finely cooked chunk of meat.Dinner for two, bottle of wine, dessert, total bill SG$650, .. not a daily event, but for that special occasion, its worth it.The venue is very nice, dimly lit, and comfortable, the service, impeccable, real pro's , and the food is just divine, everything we ate we were awe stuck w the preparation and presentation.In my 44 yrs , id have to rank my dinner ( and my wife's) as the top 3 in steaks ive ever had
5
We had another lovely meal at Morton's in Singapore. Before we had our entrees (appertisers), my daughter fell asleep on my lap, we were at a regular table. A booth had recently been vacated, and the staff were able to move us to the booth, so my daughter could lie down and sleep while we ate.
5
Well one of the top ones for sure at least...You pay a premium price for a premium steak, and they make them right here. Perfectly cooked to your liking, and it just melts in your mouth. Appetizers and dessert was good too.Service was good, it was our first time to this steak house and if I'm in Singapore again I'll definately repeat. Just remember, you get what you pay for
5
From start to finish this restaurant was faultless. From the cocktails in the bar before dinner right through to dessert. The service was excellent, attentive but not annoying staff. The table was decorated as it was my husbands birthday, they brought birthday cake and took our photo and put it into a card for us.The steaks melt in the mouth, the bread before hand is delicious. By far the nicest meal we have had in Singapore, there is absolutely nothing bad I can say about it
5
My family celebrated my birthday there. When we got there, we were shown to our table and I was pleasantly surprised to see a personalized menu. It was a great start to a wonderful dinner.The lovely waitress came around shortly after that I gave a brief description of the various cuts available for the night. My children immediately knew what they wanted for entree.They even served complimentary desert for the birthday girl and it was accompanied by the singing of the birthday song from the attentive waiters and waitresses.The steak was superbly prepared. They were scculucent and just the way I like my meats. Even the side dishes were fantastic. The sautÃ©ed button mushroom simply melt in your mouth.The price is a little on the steep side but the portion is so huge, you can actually asked to share it out.This is really a great place, a must for all steak lovers and the experience is memorable

I used to go to Morton's on a semi-regular basis for special occasions. I always knew that I could rely on Morton's to deliver the right amt of doneness I want in my steak, to provide a cosy environment and for those fantastic breathmints.However, on my recent visit, I was disappointed. I requested for a steak done medium and it came on the rare side. One of my party had his overdone. The crab cakes had shrank in size. Although these are issues that I would easily forgive in another restaurant (of lower price), I have to say that I was disappointed
1
One main each, one drink came to $350 sing. Proclaimed to have no tables till 10.15pm, we turned up at 9.30pm and they seated us, the place was half empty the entire night. Service was either overly attentive or not to be seen. Service was said not to be included as per written on the menu, and then was included on the bill and a gap left on the credit card slip. Bread was brought, was a loaf of onion bread big enough for a family, then we were told five times by the waiter not to fill up on it (why not bring bread rolls then?!?). We ordered and the waiter continuously suggested alternatives and other dishes including trying to make us order starters and dessert when we clearly didn't have any inclination to. Portions where so big we left most of the meal. My crab cakes had chunks of garlic so big that they may have well have been whole, I have brushed my teeth 5 times to no avail and am hoping to head out tonight. Seriously go anywhere but here in Singapore, the nation of incredible food, this place is a con

Morton's The Steakhouse, the best restaurant in Singapore, specializes in classic, hearty fare, serving generous portions not only the aged beef but also fresh fish and lobster. We had a wonderful dinner! Morton's famous for its animated signature tableside menu presentation: steaks, whole Maine lobsters and other main course selections, along with fresh vegetables, are presented on a cart rolled to your table, where the server display and describes each menu item in appetizing and entertaining detail. Everything was so perfect. But the price is quite high
5
Huge portions (almost ridiculous), great comfort food. Very similar to Morton's in Chicago. Great for business meals. And good for dates if you want something over the top. Expensive, but you knew that, right?
3
This is a place for people dining on expense account. The steak is average but prices are high.
Not a place to spend your own money in a city that has sooo much good food
5
Others come and go but Zee and co run this place incredibly. Wine list expensive.
3
Nice staff, very good service, ok wine list, nice decor but tasteless steaks. Size is not everything!
5
6 of us dined here, we ate fantastic food and had the absolute best service, especially from the manager, I think his name was Edwin and Roz the bar attendant. would not hesitate to recommend the food and service at this restaurant. We have dined at Morton's all over the world, but the staff made this experience so much better. Make sure you have some fun with the

I have lived in singapore for 18mths and never visited Mortons (manderin oriental hotel). Although people have recommended the visit we never got round to it until tonight....Well what can i say. Service is second to none but I want the food to follow suit to the service. but unfortunately it didnt.I feel the food is very over priced and over rated.Dont get me wrong living in singapore isnt easy when buying produce as everything is imported...But when I pay $87 for a Fillet Mignon steak i expect it to be suberb. It was chewy and full of sinue. The Entre was ok but not worth $85 for two people!!!! I complained to the management and to be fair they didnt charge for the meal!!! But our expectations were to go out for a great meal and pay for it but i feel it wasnt up to scratch....hands up to the management but the produce let you down!!!!I have frequented Pamplemousse on Dempsey and I can say the quality of the food beats Mortons hands down!!!!! DO NOT WASTE YOUR Singapore dollars on Mortons!!!! Take my word for it and prove me wrong!!!!! (An ex pat of singapore

Celebrated my birthday with my family of 4 & enjoyed every moment. Ambience was romantic & cosy. Table seating was just perfect. Waiting staff were professional & friendly. Though restaurant was packed, we had no slightest problem with the attention showered on us by every waiter the moment we stepped in. Food was plentiful, large portion & cooked to perfection. We had cold Alaskan King Crab legs, 3 different cuts of steaks namely filet mignon, ribeye & poterhouse. We shall come back
4
Usually reserved for special occasions, this visit was relaxing and enjoyable. Zyron is an outstanding Manager and has his staff on their toes which we appreciate.Price is only drawback - steaks were tasty and can definitely be shared between two.Excellent wine list. Thanks Z! We'll miss your hospitality
5
This is my second visit there.The service was excellent and lived up to the expectation of a fine dining restaurant.The steak was delicious, every morsel of it and was done to perfection.The onion bread was unique and delicious.The steak fries(large french fries) were delicious. The portions were very large so it is advisable to share the steak.Most steaks could be shared either 2-3 ways.I would advise those with small appetite to share the steak among 3 persons and then you would be able to order other side dishes and desserts.The atmosphere is wonderful for a romantic date.What I like least is the price.I think it is definitely over priced
5
Always my choice in Singapore when I want an authentic American steakhouse experience. Service is also excellent and must congratulate Zyron and the staff for many years of consistent, friendly and professional service. Wine list is one of the best in Asia, and at relatively reasonable prices for Singapore
3
You can do so much better eating on Arab Street, in Chinatown, at the fabulous Nando's on Victoria Street, at True Blue near the great Penarkan Museum, in Little India etc etc etc
2
Far too expensive. Food average. No atmosphere. Other than that, it's great. Oh, and every table there seemed to have someone who's birthday it was, with every five minutes the waiting staff singing happy birthday. Bizarre.
4
The steaks are very tender and the flavour is very good as well. The side order seletion could be better. The wine list is good but a few more by the glass seletions woul be good.But no questions should be asked about the steaks - they are really good
5
We had dinner at Mortons 10 days ago - we both ordered steaks that were trully excellent! All of the dishes were fabulous, take note that the "side dishes" are very large, more than enough to share for 2 people. Yes it is expensive as other reviews have indicated but that seems to be the case in Singapore. The staff were all very efficient, friendly and knew the menu well. The restaurant was full when we were there which we were told is usually the case so reservations are advised.Definitely recommend this restuarant if you enjoy a good steak
5
Of course the food here is amazing (everyone knows that!) so my review is instead about the service....I have been a diner at mortons for years and I wanted to compliment Shubash at the restaurant in The Mandarin Oriental in Singapore. I have visited many restaurants in my time and never before have I met such a wonderful server. Shubash was incredibly charming and sweet, going well out of his way to impress us. During the conversation my boyfriend mentioned that we were celebrating our anniversary. Soon after, shubash presented us with commemorative souvenir menus, printed with our names, dates and wishing us a happy anniversary. Wow I actually teared up because his kindness was so genuine and unexpected. I didn't think things could get better but a while later he asked to take our photo on the restaurants behalf. Of course we were happy to oblige, thinking our photo might end up on the wall, but then he presented us with a mortons greeting card enclosed with our photo and staff signatures. I can't tell you enough how wonderful shubash was, he gave the best service I have ever experienced. On our way out my boyfriend and I couldn't stop thanking him for being lovely and making our trip unforgettable
5
Fantastic steaks, cooked to perfection. I ordered a Rib-Eye rubbed with Cajun spices cooked medium. It is as close to steak heaven as it is possible to get! My daughter, who is not normally a steak eater had a well-done filet mignon, which she devoured with relish. The restaurant is not cheap but, hey, in my experience you get what you pay for in this world. Be aware that in the evening, with a couple of drinks, you are very unlikely to see any change from USD200 per person. Word of advice: unless you have a massive appetite don't order an appetiser & go easy on the delicious onion bread
4
A successful chain steakhouse - not a surprise why they're a success. Wonderful cuts of meat, the ability to cook them to the diner's request, and ambience that evokes traditional steakhouses (where one never had to worry about health). Come during weekdays from 5 pm - 7 pm for the cheap eats... 12 SGD martinis and free steak sandwiches during happy hour
4
Mortons in Singapore qualifies as at top steak joint. Very american atmosphere with noicy giggling women and waiters all over with huge trays of sizzlilin steaks...and thats what its all about, isnt it? Morton presents the meat tray very professionally, and there is a variety of cuts to choose from. Ended up with the RibEye on the bone, yummy! Ordered meduim rare and my companions ordered cold center. All ended up being cold center, which is why i grant Mortons 4 and no 5 stars. But not to worry....Its a fantastic cut...so suit up and have a fantastic evening at Mortons
4
Singapore is blessed with one of the best and most diverse restaurant scenes globally. But even so, every once in a while, we just want a steak. A proper piece of meat, grilled to perfection, in a proper steakhouse setting. This is when we head to Morton's. Sinagpore branch of the probably most fabous american chain, it caters to meat lovers and wine spectators alike
4
If you're looking for the best U.S. steak in town - look no further. Singapore is a foodies paradies, there are so many excellent restaurants that cater to every taste and cover all cuisines that the fact that Morton's has been in business and busy for so many years is a testament itself. Food is impeccable, service too
4
Everything is good ( understatement) ..... I mean excellent
Must try lemon soufflé as a dessert
3
Pretty good steak meal, although I am sure that they would consider it world class. Wine list ok as well.
The service was good as was the ambiance. Worth going to.
4
Great service and food in typically New York style steak house!
5
Ok - you're in a hotel, but the Morton's experience is awesome. Amazing service and great steak. If you need steak, this is it.
4
Just what you would expect
If you are looking for uncomplicate USA steak dining this is it
May be old fashion for some - but it's good at what it is!

I have no idea how this place makes it on the top 10 restaurants in Singapore. If steak is what you want try Ember inside Hotel1929. Morton's food is so average, I've had better steaks and salads for a fraction of the price. Hell outback steakhouse has this place beat. My tomato salad was a joke at $25, they weren't even ripe. My $30 glass of wine was crap and a very small pour. Best thing was the $20 baked potato. whoo hoo. Service was good, just good not spectacular. If you do go: I called for a reservation and they said no. We decided to go to the bar for a drink anyway, and the place was empty! They sat us for dinner right away in one of the best booths. Guess they had a lot of bookings, but even when we left there were still tables available. And how annoying that every table in there had a birthday, I think I heard the staff sing happy birthday 10 times during our dinner. The host was a funny, flirty little guy, actually the highlight of the place, he gave us a card to come back for a free martini. Still, what a yawn, go elsewhere if you want a $500 dollar dinner for two
4
The steak was good as well as the crab cake. Salad portion was huge. Service was generally good but they did forget some stuff. For the price I was expecting the steak to blow me away but it did not. It was not cooked to specification. The satisfaction level did not equate with what we paid. I will not mind going again but not tempted to go often
5
I go to Morton's Steakhouse at least once during each of my trips to Singapore (3-4 times a year). Great steaks, but also salmon and tuna as well as lamb, fantastic cobb salads and vegetable side dishes (try the creamy spinach). And, according to my wife, this is the best cheesecake she has ever tried. Some minor negatives, the restaurant's lighting is reduced to the bare minimum, and one has to wait for the waiters to deliver a seemingly interminable list of specials which would be much easier to understand, and remember, if they were written down. Still, this is one of my 2 favorite restaurants in Singapore
4
Service excellent; quick and informative. Our waiter gave us a complete presentation of the entire menu including bringing seven cuts of steak and a live lobster to our table so that we could choose. The portion sizes were very generous. Fortunately our waiter recommended sharing a NY strip steak for our main dish, ( the steak was more than 2 inches thick!) , as we had already woofed down enormous crab and tomato salad starters. All the food was of excellent quality, well cooked and very, very tasty
5
I have lived in Singapore for almost 3 years now and being from Texas, I get the urge for a great steak every now & again. That is just what I get every time I go to Morton's! A great steak, yes it is very expensive but what can you expect when you are flying in good beef from the USA. The staff is attentive without being intrusive, the starters & sides are great (try the mac & cheese), & the desserts are fabulous. Go & enjoy
2
Morton's steak is an overpriced oversold branding base and the only thing you are paying for is the nostalgic feel of the place. Even the most basic steak from Angus house in Takashimaya is much better at one third the price.
5
Great Steak place but a tad too pricey
5
Fantastic two for one cocktails with free delicious steak sandwiches!!
But get there early Happy hour is from 5pm - 7pm...but you can always then go to teh Swisshotel and catch their happy hour after!
3
Thoroughly over priced and over rated! Ordinary service, poor wine stocks and ok food
4
Morton's is a real American institution, and the portion sizes atest to that. I have no idea how my boyfriend managed to get through his succulent 20oz steak, but he did and still had room for a delicious molten chocolate cake dessert. Well, it was his birthday! The steak is the winner at this place - all the food is superb if you're a fan of big portions, although maybe it's not as special as the tripadvisor rating makes out. But we couldn't fault any of our choices. It was the old school ambience and the super-friendly staff that added to the experience. I'd booked the restaurant as a birthday treat and they went all out to mark the occassion with a personalised menu, a chorus of Happy Birthday, complimentary dessert and a framed photograph signed by all the staff. A great touch. Morton's isn't cheap, but it's a great experience. The cocktail menu is the biggest I've possibly seen, and they are very, very good! Hot Tip: The bar does a fantastic cocktail deal Mon - Fri 5-7pm with complimentary steak sandwiches ... so worth it!

This was our first visit to Morton’s and after having heard so many good comments about it, we built ourselves quite an expectation. Fine Dining at a premier restaurant. How long had it been since me and my wife did something like this without the kids? We made our reservations and had a call from Morton's to confirm our reservation. OK. So they actually make the effort to ensure that they prepare well for your experience. Both of us got dressed up and off we went. When we reached the restaurant, our disappointments began. As we approached the restaurant, it sounded more like a pub than a fine dining establishment. I thought we were at the wrong place. Alas, we weren't!! There were folks dress in t shirts and jeans and I think I may have spied someone wearing sandals. We got shown to table in the middle of the restaurant and the noise of deafening. We couldn't even have a decent conversation as (1) you had to repeat yourself due to high overall noise level and (2) you began to start talking louder just to make yourself heard till it felt like one was shouting!! We had to get educated first as what was offered in the Menu. So, our server wheeled over a trolley which had a tray of meat cuts. OK ...here's something new. He talked about Porterhouse, NY Strip Loin, Etc. Hey, with this knowledge, I could open up my own Butchery. Then he went on over to talk about the vegatables, bringing in florets of Broccoli, A whole Red Onion, A bunch of Asparagus and a whole jumbo sized Idaho Potato right to our faces! Its like we were going back to kindergarten and today's lesson is about - Vegetables!!! And through this time, we were struggling to hear him while controlling really hard our want to burst out laughing at this segment of the "experience".Right so, we made our orders and waited.The steaks were ok in terms of taste. Not ok at all in terms of value. The difference in taste between USDA and others (like NZ and Aust) beef wasn't all that much. We were prepared for this out-of -this-world kind of taste but in the end it was oh so ho-hum. Sorry, but if I made it sound that mediocre, its because it was.At no point, did we find nor experience a service level that was personal and up to the mark of such a reputable restaurant. The servers were seen rushing around from table to table and did not have the time to afford diners service that would have kept me coming back in the future. The total bill ( excluding taxes) was about $200 for a double cut fillet, a single cut fillet, two sides of mashed potatoes and button mushrooms. No wine, no appetizers, no dessert. Our opinion - Seriously over priced. Disappointing in virtually every aspect of a dining experience. Would we come back again? No.If I had to compare other restaurants for food quality, service, ambience and to make the comparison even more stark, I'd go for good 'ol Jack's Place any day or Black Angus. For great personalized service, food that stands out, and an ambience to swoon over, Gordon's Grill would be our choice any day.......then again, its just our opinion....

steak was amazing. another highlight was the appetizer. we order CRABSTICK with mayo. and its mind blowing so good, you can taste that the crab was so fresh. and its super solid. the garlic bread and butter they serve was also impeccable.the steak was served in reasonable timing. our minor complain was that they no longer serve any kind of sauce for the steak (i.e. mushroom sauce, black pepper, or any kind of standard steak sauce).but that's OK the steak it self was already amazing.i order lychee martini for drinks was also good.and of course CHOBOLATE CAKE, that we've heard so much rave about, for the grand finale. its was perfect.portion is huge. so make sure you're hungry. and DO make a reservation. cause we saw some groups have to wait for their table because they didn't make any reservation.ambiance was great. service was nice (attentive but not annoying) though menu presentation was a bit too fast we cannot hear a thing.as someone mention earlier, we know its going to be expensive, so we're not going to shout about it
1
I will keep it short as I am trying to forget having gone to this restaurant.EXTREMELY disappointing with everything from the apps, to the steaks, especially lobster and sides. ALL items were severely below standard for such a place or EVEN a chain restaurant. I have never written a review close to this negative before, so trust me when I say stay far away from this place!Really a shame seeing as how the service and ambiance was very good.The one highlight would be that they had the BEST chocolate souffle I have had anywhere in the world. I would go back only for the dessert
1
The practice of having a trussed-up live lobster carried around from table to table for hours on end as a display is not acceptable. Many better seafood restaurants do not resort to this cruel gimmick. Additionally the food is mediocre and vastly over-priced. The Oriental is a great hotel and I always stay there but this restaurant is its only weak point. I had to attend a business meeting at Morton's and will not go back. Why a visitor would bother with a steakhouse in Singapore is beyond me. There is so much better food and dining experience available
3
The wife wanted to do the Mortons thing so hang the expense. A couple of cocktails in the main bar - excellent selection and the service was good and into the restaurant. I think they had background music but I am not sure. Service was good, it is so unusual to wait 10 minutes between courses in Singapore. We went on a Saturday night which may have been a mistake as Mortons main clientèle is people celebrating and you can get sick of happy birthday after th 10th time it is sung by the staff. Spiel was barely audible, some of the steaks on display were big enough to feed 5. We ordered a lobster entree, a salad between us and fillet steaks (happen to be the smallest and cheapest which is unusual as this cut tends to be expensive)Lobster was delicious and a good size, the salad we shared was half a lettuce EACH with lots of garnishing (blue cheese). While the salad was very good it was HUGE.Steaks were good but not excellent, I've had as good or better at Fosters in Holland Village, considerably cheaper. The bernaise sauce had that congealed skin on top indicating it had been standing too long in the salver.Too bloated to eat dessert by then. We were expecting a large bill but over $500 for the meal and cocktails was just over the top
3
The steak's great but can be a little too fancy
4
Great service and food. Portions are huge. We knew it was expensive before we went so we're braced for it. Overall an enjoyable experience

Excellent steak

Best steak in town. Go on biz lunches/dinners ;)

Ols favorite steak house

not really at the top of fine dine restaurants yet

Been to Morton's twice and both experiences have been good hearty experiences. Good colonial service and atmosphere, and price. The quality of the meat is very good, and I'm always shocked people go there for other things besides beef. The salads and desserts are also good of course, and should be tried. The wine list is understanably superb. Just not sure this should be ranked as the number 1 restaurant in Singapore. It's just not global or exquisite enough. Oh, and for other good steaks in Singapore, try Uluru and Taver

What to say about Morton’s Singapore….its simply one of the best overall eating experiences you can have anywhere. Yes its expensive, yes, it has no local SE Asian cuisine and yes it’s in a hotel. Having said that, it is still, even dollar for dollar, one of the best around. The staff is delightful and attentive, even when they are rushing from table to table when the place is full….which means always. There is a fine selection of wines and spirits and the food is first rate. Mr. “Z” and his team are terrific folks and are always going the extra mile to make the experience a great one. They work equally well with large business groups or children. We hope to return soon

The steak's great but can be a little too fancy. Waiters pitch is often not well rehearsed. Anyways, its a place to go once a year, nothing more, being terribly expensive and all. It more expensive to eat in Morton's Singapore than the ones I've been to the US

Best crab cakes around. Juicy, sweet and pure unadulterated , luscious chunks of fresh crabmeat. Yummmmm..... Pricey but worth every single morsel. The steaks are juicy naturally sweet and enormous! Two can definately share, especially the prime rib. The sides are good as well....huge baked Idaho potatoes with all the trimmings, and the earthy rich sauteed wild mushrooms ...a must. The desset...the molten cake is to die for too....For two persons, without wine, 3 courses each comes out to SGD 350. Ouch...but will go back at least twice a year
5
Go for the happy hour...

Remember the wonderful steak, more than the price we had to pay...

Very nice steaks and generous portions. But be prepared to pay fine dining prices and the corkage is $60, very steep

Everyone should have at least one dining experience at Morton's. Aint a fan of steak but still enjoyed the experience and of cos the signature chocolate cake!
3
Expensive but a once in a while indulgence...
4
Excellent steak. American sized servings. Tender and juicy. Depending on the which part and type of beef you order, it can come out to be .. typically huge. So share. :)
5

Morton's has got to be one of my favourite restaurants in Singapore. I always have it at least once, when I come back home to Singapore. Although the prices are high, I highly recommend it for that special date or birthday. The service is excellent and attentive, and one should never be afraid to request anything here. The atmosphere is comfortable and familiar and the air is filled with chatter and laughter. This is a plus point and not a negative that a few misinformed reviewers who have been complaining about the ambience have been spouting. Needless to say, the food is superb. The steaks here are without a doubt the best in Singapore. The beef is of the highest quality and cooked to perfection. I'd recommend the Filet Mignon if you're after something smaller and more refined. The Porterhouse is great for sharing and is oozing with beefy juices.Side dishes are pricey for what they are, but they are well cooked and add much satisfaction to the meal. I'd recommend the stir fried onions, the spinach with mushrooms, fries and hash browns. Most of the appetizers are great too. My favourite being the Jumbo Lump Crab Cakes. They are cooked without too much seasoning or spices, letting the flavour of the crab stand on its own. It's pretty hard to find such honest crab cakes in Singapore. For dessert, one cannot go wrong with a Grand Marnier Souffle or Morton's famous Godiva Molten Lava Chocolate Cake. Both are splendid. So, mark a date on your calendar, and bring your loved ones or your favourite friends

Best roast lamb in town

The crab cakes are amazing, but not cheap. You certainly do get what you pay for.
4
The bread is to die for.
4
A bit too ex....though the steaks are quite well made.
5
My favorite. Tasty tender steak and good ambience but very expensive
5
Great steaks, sides, desserts and drinks! Best to go on an expense account, though.
5
Steak's excellent but the chocolatini rocks!
5

5
Truly the best.. with service to match! Yummy crab cakes too!!!
3
steak too huge for me, need to share
4
Quality steakhouse - not cheap.
3
Surprisingly, the grilled prawns fared better than the steak. Overall still quite good, but I would't say you get value for your money.
4
Exquisite steak and impeccable service. I was very impressed overall. It is NOT fine dining, expect a noisy and sometimes boisterous ambience. Not a restaurant for wooing. Very expensive, better for special occasions like anniversaries or birthdays. I would return, but not often.
4
When you're craving the US Steakhouse experience, this place delivers. The beefsteak tomatoes are killer. Bring clients and the corporate Amex.
4
steak steak half done plz thanks...
4
Best crab cakes and martini's in the house!
5
Hand pick your meat, stay here and eat without leaving the hotel, $$$$$$, business dinner.
5
love the steak and the fries. crab cakes were amazing. its a winner
3
We had a new york strip and a filet mignon, but felt that the steak was somewhat over-rated. Onion bread was soft and nice, and the chocolate cake was awesome. The apple pie was also good.
4
Ambience already builds lasting impression, not to mention the presentation & portions of food.
Wine selection is good as well
3
God stea, but very expensive!

Walking Menu

Best steak in Singapore - so far. Have it "black and blue" - charred on the outside and rare/medium-rare inside. The Ceaser Salad is very good too.

The KING of steak houses. Super expensive, but super amazing. This is what a fine dining steakhouse aspires to be.

My favorite in Singapore. Try the lamb Chops, creamy spinach, and NEVER LEAVE without trying the cheesecake. All of their potato dishes are amazing. I prefer the french fries.
4

3

3
Ok only. Too much hype given. Steaks are charred. Pricing? Roarrr.
4
Big big serving!!!!!!!!! Get it to share!
5
Steaks are very good. Didn't like the lobster. Guess that's why they call it a "steakhouse" and not a "seafood house". Very friendly staff who make an effort to remember you and your preferences. :p Pricey
5
martinis and the free-flow steak sandwhiches... MmmMmmm
4
I spent a New Year's Eve dinner there and it was spectacular. Of course the dinner bill was over the top too.. Loved the lobster, my friends who had the meats were very satisfied too. Beautiful ambience, they had balloons with pretty strings floating all over the room. I'd iimagine a normal meal there would still be quite nice and someone recently told me about a Happy Hour deal that sounded pretty good. I must try that
5
Without doubt, the king of all steakhouses.. Never fail to doggy-bag unfinished steaks. However, still taste good the day after though!
4
beautiful meats! fresh lobster and happy hour special is fantastic, martinis and mini burgers!
5
Best place for steaks, ever!
5
Great ambience. Steaks aside, the warm chocolate cake is fabulous!
4
the rib steak is better than the fillet mignon, very juicy and tender. the place is too dark for me, i can't see my food :(

WOW!
5
too expensive, too much food, too american, but so much fun
5
The best steakhouse I have ever been to.For Starters, you may try the prawn platter (served cold & fresh) It was succulent and the sauce perfectly brought out the taste. If you are not a prawn person, the scallop & bacon is simply sinful. The sides of buttered spinach and baked Idaho potatoes are fantastic and frankly could be eat alone.The main, for guys itâ€™s the Ribeye or porterhouse, ladies may want to try the fillet mignon instead as it is slightly smaller in portion cause everything served here is guaranteed to make you full.The Ribeye steak I had was served rare+ and trust me chilled US prime beef never tasted better .For desert either the apple pie or for chocolate lovers the hot chocolate cake with liquid center to give you that rush of endorphins.To round it up have the meal with a bottle of your favorite red wine or champagne and its the perfect evening.The best part, service is almost perfect and always obliging.Though a meal for 2 will set you by at least 200SGD++ (without wine) 300SGD++ (with wine or champagne
