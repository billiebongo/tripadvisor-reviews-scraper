Standard maintain the same for this branch. As usual long long queue is expecting and hence if I am not craving for that, I will not queue for that as i will be too hungry then.
4
The waiting time is getting longer after the renovation, but the food quality is still up there at the top! Please be there early to queue, as the waiting time can be up to an hour.

The food here is always awesome. Great quality and very consistent. Service is rush and usually there is a queue but most people don't seem to mind and always come back.
5
Lunch was always tasty. Good prompt service and replenishing of tea. Avoid peak hour crowd, I usually visit this branch at 11am when it opens.

It's not good as day one. The food standard was dropped. Xiao long pau is juicy but not that tasty. It can't Comparing with Taipei 101's

This is part of a chain of dim sum restaurants that are scattered around Singapore! This is the branch at Junction 8 and is located in the basement floor. For those who are spoiling for some good dim sum, this place is pretty good- their buns follow all the traditional "folds", have authentic flavor and their soup buns are a must have. We ordered the vegetarian dumplings, shrimp and veggie noodle, a cold beef sliced appetizer, 1 si gua shrimp soup dumpling, 1 regular soup dumpling, a round of garlic fried spinach, and shrimp fried rice. Food:1. Cold cut beef appetizer - The art of this beef is that it is marbled when you see it sliced and laid out so delicately in the thinnest slices and the marble is so intricate that it's a true delicacy hard to rival in anything I've seen in the US. the beef is well flavored and must be eaten cold as that what makes the marbled texture stay- eat this warm, and it will melt the marbled cartilage. I have attached a picture with a cup of tea next to it for comparison and it's remarkable how delicate the cut is. Not an oily dish, almost like a refreshing wet beef jerky if one were to describe the flavor. 2. Steamed vegetarian dumplings- 10 for 11.80$- For my vegetarian friends, this is the dish to get. The dumpling has various tofu and chives and vermicelli wrapped inside- it is flavorful and the green wrapping is a lovely color to see when they lift the lid off the steamer. 3. Steamed gourd and shrimp "soup" dumpling- 10 for 11$- if you're a soup bun fan, you want to try this version- it has the crunchy but yet tender soft si gua and the shrimp inside. The soup is a sweeter and more vegetable taste than its other famous typical counterpart, the vegetable and pork soup bun 4. Steamed vegetable and pork dumpling 10 for 10.30$- Gotta get the staple of soup buns if you're going to have good soup dumplings and a good dim sum set. There are the 13 folds that are described as the art of folding a true "delicacy" correctly that one will not find in American dim sum stores that usually just fold a dumpling minus the 13 folds. pick this up with chopsticks at the tip and put it into a soup spoon before eating. wait a min for it to cool or bite a small hole on top and drink the soup inside slowly as it will be hot. 5. Stir fried spinach /w garlic for 10.80$\- not over cooked and has the garlic flavor- still maintains the crisp and jade green flavor that spinach should have6. Fried rice w/ shrimp and eggs for 12.80$- a truly rich and buttery fried rice that screams generous eggs, butter, and shrimp. highly recommend this is if you are a fan of fried rices- this is truly a must hav

DTF J8 is our favourite dinner spot for the last 10 yrs. Excellent service and food was good & fast. With the recent renovation, more seats were added and the kitchen was not able to handle. Food was slow. The service staff had a hard time trying their best to keep busy and it's not their fault when obviously food coming out of kitchen was slow.I asked a staff and she confirmed the kitchen inability to deliver in time to the many diners. Thankfully the food quality maintained. Hopefully the management take note

One of my favourite comfort food restaurants that I TRY to come often to (cheaper would definitely go more often XD)..Food is usually right on standard, has never dropped so far in my book.Once seated and your tea has been poured you can peruse the menu...my favourites to order include Fried Rice with Shredded Pork and Egg - Something about this dish which one just cannot seem to mimic at home unless you have that kind of a stove or kitchen and recipe.Xiao Long Bao - These are MUST EATS. But please do NOT waste the soup by poking it with a hole and draining the soup into your bowl and NOT drinking it (that is a WASTE of food!) Theres a reason its called a soup dumpling, to eat the whole thing and not waste the soup. Most soup dumplings had anywhere else tend to be either too greasy or even too sweet sometimes. These upon bursting in the mouth can be scalding hot, are not too greasy at all, and have the perfect flavour. Oft times, one tray isn't enough.Zha Jiang Mian - The perfect balance of flavours in the sauce, combined with al dente (I find it al dente anyway, sorry if you don't. Dislike soft noodles) handmade noodles and their sauce with minced pork, preserved radish and edamame soy beans. For those who like it spicy please add the chili and oil at your table. Supposedly the chili is to die for as well.Minced Pork and Vegetable Dumplings in Superior Chicken Stock - I love this dish as it reminds me a little of Jiao Zi in soup. This is a bowl of comfort food to me and should appeal to those who don't have very much appetite. Light tasting and easy to eat.If this place had a buffet...OMG...i'd try to overindulge myself as much as I would..

i met up my friend to celebrate her birthday at ding tai fung..still as crowded..but the chicken soup did not taste as flavourful.the chicken pieces were a bit tough to chew at.the famous fried rice with pork chop did not have enough wok hei.i suspected not enough salt pepper or more seasonings were added it caused the fried rice to taste tasteless...luckily the dessert peanut soup with glutinous balls were sweet and soft though it was a bit pricey...i think the chefs at jem do a better job so i will stick to jem outlet in future

...and they have a branch in Shanghai. Dumplings are simply divine. Service very fast (all waiters are fully wired :), you can see how dumplings are made through a glass. I had vegetable dumplings, came back few times. My friends had xiao long bao (famous meat Shanghainese dumplings with bouillon inside) and raved about them. Noodle meat soup was also amazing. .... I will go to their branch anywhere in the world

Din Tai Fun has delicious dumplings. Their food and service is reliable and consistent. We love the chilli beef dumplings!
5
Ordered their famed Fried rice and Prawn Pancake ! It was awesome ! Wash it down with unlimited refills of hot chinese tea ! Place is packed most of the time but waiting is a breeze and quick !
3
Small portions, average taste, overpriced. And then you have to wait in a queue? I think it's mostly hype and little substance
4
This place is always crowded, but the food here is really delicious and served really quickly. The menu has both Chinese and English translations as well. The queue time is probably longer than your eating time though.

This restaurant, which is just a stone's away from our humble abode, has service beyond our expectations, the waiters and waitresses are and courteous. The Xiao Long Bao dumplings are my daughter's favourite dish, and she usually finishes the entire serving! The fried rice is also tasty. I would definitely recommend my friends and family to come and try out this restaurant.

While some of the hype around the brand has died down they still do what they do best!Special Mr ruin has to go to their catering for families! Before you sit the baby chair is in place and special cutlery laid out. It really helps.Food is consistently good and service prompt. There's a reason it's so popular and I keep going back

Often there is a snake queue of people ready to get into Din Tai Fung. I'm here often for the fried rice, xiao long baos and chicken soup. Queue time is shorter when you dine for 2pax. ;)At times the staff will forgot to pass you a bag hanger. Overall, it is good and extremely busy restaurant
3
I am a big fan of Din Tai Fung, but going to a branch outside of China is always a bit disappointing. The food is not as good as in China and it is more a fast food restaurant. you fill out your own order form, pay at the register on you way out etc
3
We tried lots of different item including buns, dumplings, rice dishes, appetisers, multiple desserts etc. The quality of each of those items was excellent. The casual dinning environment was also nice. Only negative is that the quantity of appetiser salad (glass noodle) or fried rice dishes was small as compared to the prices charged. The dumplings were also tiny and all these dishes cost $12-13 each!I would have given a rating of "excellent" if either the price were less or sizes of dumplings and other dishes were larger
5
Have eaten here a few times now, each time the food has been tasty!For the pricing and type of restaurant, you wouldn't bring you kids often, but as a couple on a date or catching up with friends it's perfect.The Dim Sims and Duck Parcels are awesome, highly recommended.It can get busy here at key toms such as lunch and dinner, so be prepared to wait, but the food is worth it
4
Had a very enjoyable selection of local Chinese food slightly more expensive than the normal but taste was good. Service was quick and staff attentive and happy.

Came here twice during our stay in Singapore! Amazing pork dumplings and pork buns. If you come in the next couple of months, be sure to try the special chili crab buns! Would eat here every day if I lived in Singapore.

I used to love eating at Din Tai fung. This is a restaurant that we would visit often but every time we visit, it seems that the quality is getting worse and worse. Price is not cheap too.
4
Great tasting and consistent in quality. Not the best I have tasted but for consistency and reliability I give good marks. Noodles are good too.

It’s the time of the year for people to commemorate the dumpling festival.Din Tai Fung has on offer 2 dumplings for the occasion. One is savoury and the other sweet. I had tried the sweet dumpling which is the red bean dumpling when I dined in the restaurant recently. I had the savoury dumpling: Pearl Rice Dumpling with Pork & Yam in Lotus Leaves Wrap. It costs $12.80. The steaming of the dumpling took 45 minutes.This was made with soft and chewy Taiwanese glutinous rice, tender pork belly that’s been braised for 4 hours and specially marinated pork chop, shitake mushrooms, chestnuts, yam strips and green beans. The flavour was nice and I liked the texture of the various ingredients in the dumpling, especially the mushrooms, which were chunky and had a good bite.The portion is good for at least 2 people to share, else you will be ‘Jer Lak’, which is tired of eating too much of the same thing.Try it

This is a popular restaurant and the food is nice but a bit expensive. The main problem is the rude staff, who aggressively bump you when serving and clearing dishes from the table, often before you are even finished eating them! I would not recommend it if you were looking for a relaxing experience. The discourteous wait staff will simply ruin the atmosphere for you

Din Tai Fung's much-raved about dumplings were not as delicious as I have imagined it to be. Meat dumplings (6 pcs at $7.70) and prawn dumplings (6 pcs at $7.50) are moist and compact but the fillings do lack the 'wow' factor. The recommended steam layered cake (2 for $3.50) is disappointing. It is chewy, instead of soft, and lacks taste. The small plate of stewed beancurd ( an appetizer at $4.80) is delicious and addictive. What we enjoyed indulging most at the restaurant is (surprisingly) not its food but its chilled lemongrass drink. At $4.30 per glass, it is not cheap but is really really good! Service at this restaurant is also very good. Waitresses are genuinely warm and attentive

I visited Din Tai Fung on 2nd November with my family and I was really excited cos the reviews were really good and when i reached there the service was good and the tea was nice. Too bad, I will not go back again.1. The siew mais When u see them on the menu they look so nice in the shape of little teacups, very beautiful huh? When u eat them, its just meat paste plus a little gravy plus flour. Plain flour. Im traumatised2.The xiao long bao. He skin is super dry and the gravy is almost non-existent. Dont even bother trying it.3.The rice. The rice is very nice, especially the pork rib fried rice and the fried rice woth chicken strips. Which was why I even bothered giving this review 3 stars. U guys should really try that one.4.The noodle. More flour. The mushrooms are okay but the noidle is simply bad5.The wanton soup. MORE FLOUR. 6.The mango pudding. Its okay-ish but its too sweet like they added sugar to it and if they did they added too much. I think if you want to eat superb mango pudding you should just go to Crystal Jade, their mango pudding is nice and you can add ice cream to it? Not sure if they have it in every branch though.Their service however is very good. They promptly refilled tea and served us our food. Kudos to the waiters and waitresses.Overall the taste is average and the service is good, so I will settle for 3 stars

As an avid lover of the pork dumplings which is supposed to be their signature dim sum, this is real disappointment compared to their flagship store in Taiwan. The franchise over here has lowered down the quality of the food offered here by a lot. Comparatively to many other similar establishments, this is one that I will not visit again. But one visit to another chain of Cantonese establishments is really worth commending.

When we first came here I would have given it 5 stars, but now it has downgraded soooooooooo much, the beef noodles, xiao long bao and the dou sha xiao long bao are still very good, actually the food is not bad, but the price is going up, for example, the beef noodles used to be approx. 9 dollars now it is 11+ dollars, the serving portions are average, but pretty small, I think it could get better
