The sashimi is fresh, however, for those who don't eat sashimi, they will have limited choices of food. The service is good where when we want to order more, she stop us and say that it is enough and ask us to wait for the food to be served, if not enough we can order more later

Tried the $80 omakase because the waitress said that my friend and I had to both order an omakase of the same amount in which in all my years of dining at jap restaurants, it's a first. It started out with spinach and unagi. The unagi was a little rubbery but still edible. Sashimi was alright, fish was fresh. The tempura however was crispy for mine but soggy for my friend's leaving him grumbling even though mine was left out for awhile because I didn't finish the previous course. Sushi was average, nothing special. I made the choice of the yuzu ice cream and it is way better than the sea salt. Overall the great thing about the place would be the service from the manager(I presume). He greets and thanks enthusiastically.

Went over on a weeknight for a sudden omakase craving. Their aircon was down but we decided we'd go ahead. The manager was really friendly and apologetic over the aircon. They served iced water once we sat down and adjusted the fan for our comfort. Gave us a ten percent discount for that.We ordered the $50 omakase. Understood from the waitress that the $80 option was for more unique fish variety. We were no connoisseur of sashimi fishes so went with the common ones. The pieces were just right in thickness, bringing out immense juiciness on your bites. I feel hungry just writing about it. Very simple dinner but most things were pleasant. Hubby thought the omakase was missing a dish like garlic rice. The serving was okay for us, but less than the usual omakase we think.Will return to try their ala carte menu

We came on a friend's recommendation and had a lovely meal. Other reviews noted "pricey," but it's not especially so. The sushi is tender, fresh, delicious, the menu extensive and service genuinely attentive. Lovely miso soup. The waiter carefully went over the bill, which is unusual. It was comfortable, quiet, polite. The staff seemed easy and attentive to each other. We would surely go again

Was late night and hungry so decided to find a Japanese with no queue~ ended at Sushi Kou. Service is very good, however the prices were a bit steep. We went for Wagyu Beef at $30+ and there were only small few pieces. It does however comes with a set - Chawanmushi and fruits. Personally, I won't be going back and wouldn't exactly recommend it. There are plenty of food around the area that costs half the price and is as good.

It is funny that my previous review right below was 5 stars. My last visit is at lunch hours was 1 yr ago. I ordered sushi platter, waiting for more than 40 mins, it came. But sushi is smelly. I had 2 and give up. At casher, I told the manager about smelly sushi. Given this was my favourite sushi place, I hoped they would keep an eye on the fish in the future. He replied, no, that is impossible, our fish is fresh, blah blah. he kept on repeated these. It irritates me even more for his reaction. Explanation is fine, but not deny straight on my face. I wished that I had kept the smelly plate n let him.to eat it So I decided not to come here again..

Very fresh fish and helpful staff - though sometimes we had to wave a lot to get attention, even though the place was almost empty by the time we finished. The Ikura chawan-mushi was a high point, and there was a generous amount of fresh fish in the chirashi set meal. We were disappointed that they had no uni on hand, We ended up with more food than we could eat - and things add up very quickly on the bill if you order a few appetizers

The japanese sets are reasonably priced with lots of combo to choose from. The sashimi are fresh and thick. The gindara and unagi are nicely grilled with teriyaki sauce. The meal is quite filling. Ambience is great and the staff are professional and approachable. will go back again

Don't judge a book by its cover. This small Japanese restaurant tucked amidst other casual Japanese eateries is a little gem. Be pampered by the attentive waiting crew led by Anthony. Food is prepared by the its chef from Japan. His apprentices of 5 over years assisted him in preparing what might be fine Japanese dining at an affordable price. Ask for recommendation of sake to pair with the excellent sushi and sashimi. The draft Sapporo will do too. Try it! It's a little different from the other draft Sapporo. It's dispensed from a machine that is more common sight in Japan. Almost any type of visit is suitable. I went with family and for business and with friends. Ate there alone too

Needed a place for a quick lunch. Good food in decent sized portions, well-presented. The fish was very fresh. Excellent service.

Have been there various times when in Singapore. Sushi is very good and prices are relatively moderate for Singapore. Staff is really friendly and very attentive.

High quality sushi & sashimi - one of the best that I had in sg. No crowds but never empty. Your loss if you choose chains, such as sushi tei, instead of this little gem. Incomparable!

A small cosy restaurant that serves excellent Japanese food. Their menu may not be extensive but whatever they prepare, they do it well.
Do not be afraid to ask the staff for suggestions, especially after a delivery from Japan. Prices are reasonable too!

I am a regular customer there. Raw fish are imported directly from Japan twice a week. Besides great sushi, I really admire their positive service attitudes! Friendly atmosphere. Love it!

We came here because the line at ramen place next door was way too long so we decided to have sushi. We ordered three dishes and sake. The bill was about $70 so I thought it was reasonable. We got seated at the bar because of no reservation. The service was excellent. When we ordered saba fish, the waiter took the middle part (with bones) to kitchen and deep fry for us. What I loved most was how tasty sushi rice was and I finished the whole bowl of chirashi. We will return and next time we will make RSV

Japanese restaurants are everywhere in Singapore, I've dined from haute to casual - this restaurant isn't fancy or something you'd find on top 10 lists, but more by chance. It's one of my favorite sushi places based on the simplicity of dishes and excellent quality of the sashimi and sushi rice. It's affordable and the portions are generous. Service is usually on point. Highly recommended

We had the $50 per person Omakase set. The Omakase was not bad but not awesome when you compare it objectively to all omakases. I've had Omakase three times before this in an excellent restaurant in cuppage plaza, all were at the same restaurant for about $120. But this review isn't fair if you compare a $50 set to a $120 set. The Omakase here didn't wow me like my $120 experience at Cuppage but it did the job for $50. What we didn't like was how the waitress tried to pressure us into taking the pricier $80 set. She talked down the $50 set saying that the fish used is "ordinary". Dint talk down your own product when doing a sales pitch. Just talk up your other products. That's sales 101. Nevertheless, we understood what the waitress meant by "ordinary" later. The raw fish in the $50 set is literally the common usual suspects that you see on conveyor belts. But I must be clear, the quality isn't of a conveyor belt. This isn't a bad experience for Omakase amateurs. Just know that it's not going to be the same as splurging on $150 Omakase sets.

Visited here for lunch recently and tried one of the set lunches. The sushi was good but didn't seem to be as fresh as might be desired (some of the pieces leaving a slightly unpleasant after-taste). Decent value with a miso soup included and a Japanese custard and small dessert (although the dessert was just some chunks of jelly and wasn't especially memorable). Good service
