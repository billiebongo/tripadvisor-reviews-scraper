Great Parta, service could be improved, gravy lacks the ummphh of the real authentic flavours, the crispiness of the Prata makes up for it though
Overall an enjoyable place, well worth the visit to bedok

Decided to try this for late supper. Thankfully, the prata was nice and so is the curry. Even on a weekday night, the place is >70% full.

The service is really slow. The manpower is less. My Guess, kitchen space is small. Order delivery takes about half an hour on average. Don't visit when you are really hungry. ðŸ˜‚

Great effort by Mr. Prata to differentiate itself from the plethora of eatery without the hefty cost of your daily meal haunts. Prices are only a tad higher or same as your neighborhood coffee shop but comes with electronic wireless Order (waiter done without service charge!) and air conditioning!! The only charge is GST!!Highly recommended if u need your prata crave without burning a hole in your pocket and mid class service and ambience too

The prata and thosai are of the right mix and crisp. However the curry gravies seems Abbot lacking. Lacking in the sense of thickness. It's a bit watery. Both the fish curry and Sambar dhal are watery. If it was more thick and rich then this experience will be excellent.

It was 29 Jan 2017, the 2nd day of lunar new year. Most of the chinese coffeeshops, restaurants, shops were closed for business. Visited Mr Prata Halal Restaurant, operated by Muslim to pack dinner. Clean non aircon 24-hours restaurant without wifi, indoor and outdoor seating. Placed order at the counter, scan order slip and made payment at the cash collection machine. Payment by cash or NETS only. The restaurant staffs handle no payment at all. Amazing.Ordered an indian dish, Masala Thosai. Mixture of potatoes, long bean, cabbage, nuts salad wrapped in thin flour wrap.Tasty thosai dipped in fish curry and naan are just perfect. Really tasty worth the $2.90. Enjoyed

Blk 742 - the receipt shows the block no.I particularly love the richness of the bryani and the achar (full of spices/richness).The curry was thick and fragrant. I ordered the fried fish instead.The lime tea goes well if you are eating this plate of bryani. But do remember to ask for less sweetness/sugar as the Indians/Malays love their tea very sweet !Other than Indian food, they also serve Western as well as local food like Nasi Pattaya, Mee Rebus, etc.Will definitely go again as the service is fast and the Indian guy mending the counter is patient and friendly.Suitable for 4 people. With big group - you might have problem finding a table

Visited Mr Prata Restaurant for breakfast this morning. It is non aircon and has indoor and outdoor seating. The restaurant has gone cashless. Order the food at the front counter, proceed to the payment collection machine to make payment. The machine can collect both notes and coins. Simultaneously providing change for the differences.Bus service 5, 21, 22, 59, 65, 66, 228 and CT18 come here.Had prata with egg and masala thosai for breakfast. Food served within 5 minutes. The food cost about 10 cents more than the neighbouring coffeeshop. Still acceptable as the food is tasty.Enjoyed the meal.

Had a quick dinner here. Ordered the tissue prata, plain prata and egg prata. Our favourite was the tissue prata which was nice and crispy. Yum yum. Though a little on the sweet side and slightly oily. The plain as well as egg prata were not too bad but would prefer them slightly more cooked for a crispier effect. Overall a simple and quick dinner.
