Good value set lunch. Also well priced for dinner. Not a long menu; just 4-5 items on the chalkboard.

I visited Ah Bong's last week for lunch with friends. We made a reservation for four so seating was not a problem. The menu for the day is set out on the wall. My prawn aglio olio was fragrant, delicious and satisfying. The portion was very decent despite the very reasonable price of $12 for pasta, drink and decent. I will definitely visit again. The place is most accessible from the Downtown mrt line

I've been wanting to return since I had this last year, but it's a bit out of the way for me. took my family this time on a Sunday evening. We had a good spread with Seafood aglio olio, pesto, Angus, ravioli. Burrata with tomato and house bread, crab cakes. All pasta dishes with the homemade pasta option. Pesto could have been tastier. Seafood aglio olio wasn't the typical aglio olio, more like mee pok and tasty. I also enjoyed the Angus, with black pork and beef cheek, interesting with a frilly type of pasta. Ravioli was black and also good. One of us loves pasta and had two plates on her own. House red wine was really good. And the calamansi mint drink. Though we would all prefer if they served water instead of mineral water. The male staff was great, very polite and diplomatic with two family members fighting to pay the bill. Chris was great with taking our reservation just an hour before we arrived. The table was ready when we arrived half an hour early. Will return for comfort pastas and bread and a nice outdoor eating environment in the evenings. And maybe the one for one pastas on weekday evenings in Nov!

I visit with my other half for a meal on weekdays. If you're looking for typical italian food place, this might not be for you- but if you're trying to find somewhere that melds the best of local produce with familiar italian dishes then pay this place a visit!Ah Bong's meat-based pasta sauces have a distinctly asian flair and use local ingredients which might not be everyone's cup of tea. I personally prefer the sauce-based pastas rather than the aglio style ones as they tend to be a bit too "dressed" up and a little too wet for my liking. I love their home-baked bread with burrata, it's a constant favourite! The menu changes a few times a week so it's worth a visit

I have heard of Ah Bong’s a few times and wanted to taste it myself. The place is no longer in Tiong Bahru but near Bugis. The place is small. When we arrived someone sat us down and explained us the menu (really fast that I couldn’t catch everything). Love that they had many “unique” pasta choices. The gnocci was greaat but I was rather disappointed that they mostly offered seafood dishes :(

We ordered the Birthday Pasta, which was cooked with black pig bacon, chilli, etc. The flavour is kinda weird and no chilli taste at all. The Mentaiko Prawn pasta was really disappointing, scarcely mentaiko flavoured. Both pasta dish looked and tasted like they were done by an amateur trying to whip up a quick pasta at home. The raved Comfort Eggs was nothing to shout about. The tiny brownie that can with the sets tastes of salt not mixed thoroughly.

A basic Italian restaurant - plastic table and chairs, few items on a chalkboard menu, pay for your food after ordering rather like in a bar. However, the food was decent. We had the comfort eggs, 2 runny poached eggs with mushrooms and sausages, rather like a cooked English breakfast. I had to Duck Ragu - the pasta was not overcooked, the duck was tender, but it could have had more duck in the ragu. Finished with a tiny tiramisu (SGD 6!) but the topping was mascapone cheese and there was a generous portion of alcohol which could be tasted, however the cake/ladyfingers part of the dessert was a let-down. The passionfruit drink is worth a try - fruity with tang, not sweet which was a nice change. Overall, a reasonable meal. Worth a try

Came here for lunch today and opted for the set lunch at $12 plus a $2 top up for a cappuccino. The mains were pasta based dishes: I opted for the pork sausage sauce. Dessert was a small chocolate brownie. The cappuccino was small but good. At this price point it's hard to complain. Quite popular at lunchtime.

The menu is on the wall and you pay at the cashier immediately after you order but the food is nicely made at a very reasonable price ($14-16) and the quantity is ample to share between the two. The tiramisu desert is also a must to try for $3

Tried 3 dishes: Duck Fat Truffle Fries, Comfort Eggs and Crab Meat PastaDuck Fat Truffle Fries were pretty good. I'm personally a fan of fat fries hence the size of the fries here definitely hit the spot. Truffle smell was present but I highly doubted that the fries were deep fried in duck fat. Comfort eggs consist of sous vide eggs on a bed of sausages and mushrooms. Truffle oil was drizzled over it as well. One of my eggs was served broken upon which kind of dampened my spirits a little. The dish doesn't quite work in my opinion as the there isn't really anything holding the separate ingredients together. The most disappointing dish was the crab meat pasta. We topped up $6 for the handmade pasta and it was the worst $6 spent ever. Dish was very dry and doesn't have any gravy nor oil. It was really better off eating all of the ingredients separately. Some may say that the pasta was cooked al dente. I'm a fan of chewy pasta but the pasta here was bordering on undercooked. Space is small and we were seated very close to two other couples and all of us could hear each others' conversations. My boyfriend even offered some help when he overheard the other couple discussing about the drinks. I guess you could call it a group date then. Nonetheless, staff behind the cashier was friendly. Service was brisk and no-frills
