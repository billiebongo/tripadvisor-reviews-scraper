The food was lovely, a bit pricey but personally I believe it was worth it. However, we were sitting inside and the music was too loud. Almost impossible to have a conversation between the 4 of us. Other than that, lovely setting.
4
I had always loved the food and it's in a great location. Making pre show drinks/dinner easy breezy!
5
A nice place to chill with friends for dinner. A wide variety of foods and food served are all yummy
4
Parma Ham salad is good! Served with slightly salted balsamic vinegar.
There are real salted egg in the salted egg drumlets, although it is not heavily sauced, but every bite has the real salted egg taste.
Seafood risotto is as awesome as the last time.
4
We ordered 2 pasta and 1 pizza. very good, will visit again definitely. Very nice atmosphere and environment.

We came across this restaurant which faces the Marina Bay when the heavens opened and we needed to take shelter from the heavy downpour.A few tables enjoying lunch, the rain wasn’t stopping anytime soon so we decided to eat as the food looked fresh and tasty. We shared a flavoursome Parma ham and mozzarella salad which was fresh, zingy and lots of flavour and some calamari.The service at lunchtime was really good and so we decided to return that evening.Service in the evening was extremely poor. The restaurant down and upstairs really busy and people kept on arriving with no seats being available. We managed to secure a tiny table on the open roof area on the edge with a fabulous view across the bay and the illuminated iconic Marina Bay hotel. Perfect!Our waitress was choosing to serve diners that arrived after us which became incredibly annoying to the extent my husband felt forced to complain. The service didn’t speed up and trying to catch the waitresses attention to replenish our drinks....no easy task at all!We shared a huge pizza and I don’t like pizza generally - this was the best pizza I have ever eaten! Perfect base not too thin or thick and chunky topping with rocket on top.Yummy.I would go back here if ever in Singapore again.

Where to begin.. The restaurant looks good and is in a nice location, thats about all the positives we had from our experience. It was a Sunday evening and after seating us outside which was what we wanted, the staff didnt come back to take out order for drinks or food for 15 mins - after having to wave the wait staff down from outside the window. It seemed like all the wait staff beside two of them were new, they had no idea what was what and cleaning tables all over the place - it wasnt even busy. When we finally got to order it was another 20 mins before our entree of bruschetta came out, the bread was stone cold and half were burnt. One main pizza came out straight after the entree while the rest of us sat and waited for our main pastas which the first one came out 20 mins later and the waiter didnt know what pasta it was nor who ordered it. After he walked it back into the kitchen to find out what it was he returned. The other pasta arrived 10 mins later. Wouldnt go back

We chanced upon this restaurant after an event at the Esplanade Annexe studio, which is just next door. As we were not very hungry then, we only ordered 3 items to share. We had avocado and strawberry salad, chicken satay and Thai taro cake. All were delicious but the standout dish has got to he the chicken satay. The meat was marinated and grilled to perfection, it was highly recommended.
4
First meal in Singapore spent with friends at this place. The location was perfect, not only for the vibe but also to view the light show flashing across the water. The server, Sunshine, was delightful as well as helpful in guiding us through the menu. It was a great way to begin our visit
4
First time to dine at Supply and Demand and didn’t know much about this restaurant. Location wise, was abit difficult to find and got lost until friend came to meet up!Good variety of food such as pizza n pasta, finger foods etc. Though there wasn’t much of a wow factor, just the usual!We ordered a couple of bottles of wine however my friend said the white wine wasn’t chilled enough. Even after leaving in the ice bucket which was full of water rather than ice!!!Liked the interior and was spacious for large group gatherings
5
Love the ambience and service. Everyone has a smile on their face and accommodating to requests. Such wonderful service and body language, I hope this don't change.
4
Went there for a date night, great view of marina bay. A pity they do not serve mains in the rooftop
4
Came in on a Sunday afternoon to have some Prosecco and starters. The burata was delicious as was the avocado dip. The Prosecco was also good value. Service was ok. Great location though.
4
Was a good visit, staff are friendly and the food came quick and tasty! Will definitely come back for more
4
Great dining place with good food and relaxing ambience, perfect for a gathering or a romantic date.
4
We had salad and pizza, both were good. Service was prompt.
Heard their fries are good, will be back to try them :)
4
Food was delicious, love the garlic truffle fries and the salted egg yolk drumlet. Service could be better. Servers not very attentive, a bit hard to get their attention.
4
Strolling along the esplanade on another balmy, humid Singaporean evening, an outdoor meal seemed unappealing, so we opted for this venue. It did not disappoint. The meals were delicious (we had a split pizza - two choices of toppings and a selection of 4 sausages. The pizza had a nice, thin, crispy crust and adequate toppings , the service was good and the bill was affordable
1
Long story short;1. Waitress didn’t bother to tell us the they don’t serve the same menu at the outdoor seating area on the second level. (it’s ok, i accept) 2. Queue management system wasn’t working, prompt us to look for an attendant. (still ok, i accept) 3. No waiters or waitresses in sight to attend to the customers at the waiting area. (not too good) 4. Waitress comes and talk to a group of customers of her own ethnicity and ignores everyone else standing in line for over 15 minutes + staff walking to the counter and doing their own stuffs without turning back to see what the customers waiting need (TRIGGERED) 5. And we only found out that we had to wait 30 minutes for seats after overhearing the waitress’s conversation with those she was talking to in their own language. 6. All in all disastrous service, me and my gf just walked out of the restaurant. Absolutely ruined my plan for her birthday and would not recommend this place for important dates. I usually don’t write reviews but this one made me so you can imagine.
4
I went to supply&demand (esplanade) with a couple of friends. The ambience was nice and cosy for groups. The trufle garlic fries was really good (we had the salted egg yolk fries but didn't like it as much). The signature pizza was good too, however we didn't enjoy our chorizo and minced pork pasta as much.
5
The salted egg drumlets was awesome and also the truffle fries was just nice, but would prefer thin fries instead.
5
The service was excellent. The foods was good. The atmosphere of the restaurant is so good. Suitable for gathering and celebration!
5
Nice Italian cuisines, good restaurant atmosphere, recommended the flip-half pizza, very nice. Worth a try.
4
The garlic fries is good! Was dissappointed with the pasta and seafood pizza i ordered that day. My usual order of the morning after pizza is the best!
5
I really enjoyed this restaurant; swift service, honest food for reasonable prices and a great atmosphere.
5
Had a great wednesday night at supply and demand @ esplanade to celebrate my good friend's 21st birthday! We love the ambience filled with various hit songs and the service was really impressive as we were served promptly whenever needed :) Food was pretty decent, especially the desserts! We had the matcha red bean cake which was not too strong and the unicorn fart was yummy! Will definitely return soon :
4
Were there for birthday dinner. Everything else is good except for the pumpkin risotto which is not widely acceptable by the 4 of us, more sweet than savoury for a meal dish. The atmosphere at the lower level is a bit too noisy to have a decent conversation. The view was a bit compromise as we'll
4
My friends made a reservation for this place in celebration of my 40th. Perfect location in Explanade. Before or after dining you have the opportunity to admire the iconic Singapore attractions at night when they are all lighted up. Food was great, too! We had steak and pizza and pasta and salad. We all have them a thumbs up. Drinks were also served in this tin with a dessert spoon to scoop up tidbits of fruits
4
Had a lovely dinner to celebrate my friend's birthday. We sat outside in the evening, it was nice and cool with the beautiful skyline at the back. The staff also helped to personalize the cake we ordered by writing her name with chocolate, a nice touch. Food was awesome as always!
2
Nice ambience to this place and a very extensive menu. Our group of 8 experienced delays of 15 minutes from first person receiving their meal to the last.My pizza arrived with an uncooked egg in the middle. The whites should be cooked an runny in the middle. Other people on the table abandoned their food half way through - it was really not that good. To be fair, I would say it is "alright" at best.The waiters were dismissive of delays and food quality. This is unfortunately fairly typical of some of the restaurants here in Singapore - money spent on the restaurant look and a pretty mediocre attempt at operations
4
This place is happening, specially terrace , loved the food...nice rooftop with innovative seating gives you different experience no matter if you are visiting more than once...
Pizzas are awesome ... nice view from terrace ... amazing music nice ambience ...
5
Ordered squid ink risotto and chef’s choice of chicken set for my date with my girlfriend. Delicious and flavourful. Every bite is an experience. One of my favourite cafe after the visit.
5
The service provided by the waiters and waitresses were excellent. The ambience was great too, my friends and I really enjoyed the whole dining experience.
4
The food was delicious and in big servings. The quite high prices matched the location but overall had a pleasant time there. The music was a bit too loud.
5
Visited Supply and Demand to celebrate a dear friend's birthday. Service was prompt, good for large group. Delish food!
5
Went here twice during the Grand Prix weekend it is located on the Esplanade with lovely views and a roof top bar overlooking Marina Sands Hotel .
Great staff , fab food , would recommend and we would return .
4
The Carbonara was really good! We had an add on calamari for the sides/appetizer, really good as well!
4
Food was not bad. Ambience was nice. Brought my bridesmaid here for dinner and to discuss wedding stuff. Good place for discussion as it was not too loud.
5
The food was very good. Service was also very good. The staffs were very helpful. Only thing is that the table size was too small for 4
2
Hi there, it's the 4th time we have been to Supply and Demand and this time it was not a great experience. We went on Early Friday to have dinner before the theatre. My steak was cold. We ordered lamb chops twice. One portion were good the other one the chops were full of fat. We understand lamb can be fatty but this was not restaurant quality. The manager advised that chef said this was normal and all chops were like this but obviously not as the other plate was fine.We will go back again as the other times were good.
2
I've been here a few times previously but standards seem to have dropped. The beef pizza which was suppose to have jalapeño was replaced with chili padis. The lychee mango frizz drink I had was 4/5 ice & tasted mainly sugary.
5
Love their truffle fries and Hawaiian pizza. Portion and taste was worth the price. Will be back! Recommend!
5
Service was a little slow as it was super busy being National Day, but all the staff did the best they could and we had a great time. Food was on point and price was reasonable.
4
We had dinner there and really enjoyed the relaxed atmosphere. The squid ink risotto and beef bowl were delicious. The staff were especially friendly and attentive, helping us to switch tables to the outdoor area upon request.
2
This place looked promising from the outside and from the menu. The prices looked a little bit high but I was willing to give it a try because we were hungry. I was very disappointed when I got my food. I ordered a salad for my dinner and the portion I got wasn't even the size of a normal side salad. My husband ordered a chicken dish that wasn't much bigger. Needless to say, we left the restaurant still starving and out $60 for two main dishes and a beer
4
Generous portions and the truffle rice with beef or chicken was just lovely. Soft boiled egg over the rice is an excellent idea.We enjoyed a spread of appetisers too - garlic truffle fries, satay nachos, salted egg fries and drumlets. The Morning After Pizza is a winner.The pastas were less inspiring. We had the seafood marinara, squid ink risotto and carbonara cremoso.Service seemed disorganised and when told that we were still waiting for a main, they admitted that they missed it out. Instead of getting it to us quickly, we were still waiting 30 min later! We cancelled and one of our party went without a main. We headed off somewhere more reliable for a nice dessert to make up for the missing main
2
Went there after a concert on Sun for a late dinner with my son. He ordered a steak but it was so stringy that most of the beef ended up back on the plate! And this is after cutting it up to really small pieces so it was chewable. For the price this restaurant charges, I expected much better. I had a beef bowl and it was ok though I also found the meat too veiny. Although the place was not crowded at all, it took a while to get the staff's attention even to order the food. I had to ask the waitstaff if she was ready to take the order. So disappointing as I remembered coming here a year ago and it was better. For those at Esplanade wanting a steak, I think better to try Mischief
3
We had the outdoor seat and one of the worst thing was the cups provided there (all 4,stacked) have some really obvious stains and I had to ask for an exchange. Food was average. The squid ink ravioti (tasting portion) which cost an additional $4 more..ravioli is tasteless and not very well done. Not forgetting the food itself is already expensive. While the carbonara cremoso was not as bad (with the portion and taste).
3
went for a quick weekend lunch when it is not a busy hour, ordered one side (garlic bread), one pasta and one small pizza. after the other two were served and finished, we waited another 20-30 mins for our pizza. Guess the order was neglected somewhere in the kitchen - there was a sign saying 15 mins where pizzas are made, but clearly ours took something like 50 mins. food was good though. very nice pizza
3
One of the more affordable eatery for a nice ambience of activities at Marina Bay, which for us is National Day. Booking was swift and the host was pretty prompt in replying. However, it's a little disappointing that the rooftop bar was too busy on National Day and have forgotten all about my requests for a dessert with a specially dedicated birthday greeting for my husband. Our dessert was served along with our appetizer even before the pizza came, and not with the gelato I preordered over the phone. Also, waitress didn't seem to have communicated with the hostess about my concern about the drinks included in the cover charge and didn't allowed my request for any non alcoholic drinks until I highlighted to her that I have preempt her colleague during my reservation that I'm pregnant. Nonetheless, the food is fine and service is average which I believe could be better on a non peak period. Still a nice place to chill out if you aren't too particular about food
3
a place that having supper with pizza and snacks food after 12am in the midnight, cozy roof top area.
4
Nice place for chilling ! Good view but not that fantastic though. If we can order pasta or other main course would be good!
3
Very easy to get to the restaurant by taxi or MRT. In regards to the location it's my favorite but food was not as nice.
4
Supply & Demand has a great atmosphere. There is a rooftop bar above with great views. There is a live band too.
4
This is a busy, catchy, fun restaurant and bar with good food, good service and reasonably priced food and "house" wine. Make the effort to find this comfortable restaurant close to "Gluttons".
4
The food was great, the ambience excellent. Even though it was a Saturday evening and it was crowded, the service levels were terrific.
4
Overall quite satisfy with the food and service. The waitress was very patient in explaining what's on the menu, and recommendation. She suggested house wine and the Merlot was nice. My colleagues had a great time there!
1
We tuned up here as a group of 8 people, covering 4 generations of our family including an 84 yr old in a wheelchair. We asked for a table for eight and even though there were plainly empty tables we were turned away. This was disgusting. Obviously we never got to eat there. But, they also ensured I would never return to try it if I am on my own or with friends
2
Made a reservation for 2pax for a weekend dinner. We have dined there previously on weekday dinner and overall experience was great. However, we beg to differ this time round. Our table was SOOOOOOOOO closed to the table next to us, that anyone who walked pass had to walk/slide through the tiny gap which kept brushing against our table and pizza pan. On top of that, we were seated so close to the table next to us that throughout the entire dinner, all we could hear was their conversation. Having been there on both weekend and weekday dinner, we would definitely recommend to go on weekday, service was better, and you are more likely to get more comfortable table seats.
2
Due to a show at the esplanade, we are trying a few of the restaurants in the Esplanade. The area is geared towards tourists checking out the waterfront. We gave Supply & Demand a go, and it wasn't great. Pasta definitely bought in, and the sauce was really thick and claggy. My benchmark was pre-prepared sauces and a bit "ready-meal" consistency. The caesar salad looked ok, but my husband said it was pretty average. It filled a gap. Pizza get's a better rating on reviews, so maybe they should focus on what they do well. Service was a bit random, and appeared a bit short on people
4
It's my second time here and I would come back again. Love the food, the service and the atmosphere. But we were at a rather squeeze-y place though still acceptable.
5
There's variety choices of food... their popular truffle sweet potatoes taste great... as well as the crispy crunchy chicken drumlets
4
Good food at reasonable price . However, when it's crowded, indoor can be quite noisy. Location is ok.
5
As usual, the pizza is amazing. I went for the fifth time and I was never disappointed. And the place is really cool if you prefer eating outside.
5
the place was awesome, the service better than what i expected especially it was on weekend, the food affordable!!
4
Food is delicious. Decoration of restaurant is great. Atmosphere is good but quite noisy between tables and tables.
4
Pasta portions are available in the tasting and full portions which is good for someone like me who doesnt have too big an appetite! Their skinny crust pizza is pretty good tasting as well. Some dishes could be rather costly though. Anyways, did not get to sit outdoors due to the slight drizzle but nevertheless indoors was great and there is a live band from 9pm onwards on friday and saturday nights!
4
Good food... interesting presentation and infusion of flavours... we had the Beef and Truffle Rice + Chicken with Truffle Rice (the chicken skewers were divine) and the absolutely fragrant Sambal Seafood Marinara. FINALLY to top it all off was dessert! We had the Unicon's Fart - S&D's version of the rainbow cake with salted caramel. It was delicious with Rum and Raisin ice cream on the side
5
Their Vodka E Gamberetto pasta was really delicious, while the Al Granchio pasta was slightly on the salty end. In addition to their pasta, their signature pizza (La Mattina Dopo) was very tasty!The parma ham with rock melon was slightly disappointing though. Much of the ham were too tough to bite and couldn't be swallowed.Would highly recommend this place for any friends meet-up or to fix your pasta/pizza cravings
4
visited this outlet a couple of times with friends and colleagues on different occasions. for this particular outlet at Esplanade, it oversees Singapore CBD area. reservation can be made online or by calling.food is above average, but what stands out the most is the Garlic Truffle Fries. this is a must eat when you are here! they do serve a wide range of craft beers which changes occasionally. service wise, there are good and bad experience. but what matters the most if the company you are with right? :
4
Went after a long day walking around the city. The place is very nice, pizza was really one of the best I've had (Parma ham for me and vegetarian for my wife). Definitely good value and very welcoming staff. And absolutely recommended.
4
The food standard was good and value for money. It serve Italian foods and have a great view of Marina Bay Singapore in the evening.
4
Great variety of food and I particularly like the unique order. The setting is also just nice for the 11 of us and the staffs are friendly.
3
We had made a reservation for 6 adults at 6pm (opening hour) and were brought to our indoor seats which were at a corner, in close proximity to the couple dining next to our seating. The arranged seating consisted 2 regular-sized tables (fit for 2 pax) joined together with 3 chairs on either side which was a squeeze. When we brought up the issue to the staff who led us in, she insisted that it was a standard arrangement for 6 and failed to offer an alternative. As it was relatively empty with only a few tables occupied throughout the restaurant, we then requested to move to the outdoor seating which had larger tables that had appropriately sufficient space for 6 adults. We only had 3 menu booklets to share around and had to request for one more 5 to 10mins later, no initiative from the staff. That being said, one of the male staff did display thoughtfulness by placing an additional bottle of water on our table when he noticed that we only had half a bottle left. Overall the food was average, the Truffle and Egg pizza and the sausage platter was pretty good. There was just enough table space for the amount of food we ordered, I don't know how that would've been able to be served on the 2 joined tables we were initially allocated. I'd say that the service in general was really lacking at the Esplanade branch. I've been to the Orchard branch and it was a much better experience. The most disappointing part was the initial service from the female staff who led us to our table and didn't look pleased when we requested to sit outside at the larger table. Instead of retorting that it was standard arrangement, she could have offered to seat us elsewhere. I would have understood perfectly if it was crowded and we were walk-in customers but that wasn't the case. I may return to Supply&Demand at Orchard but I'm definitely giving the Esplanade branch a miss.
3
I hate to leave bad reviews but I was not happy with my experience here. I ordered a $16 salad as it was the only thing on the menu for vegans and it was so small. It was tiny. Really not worth $16. My friends also had coplaints with their food, eggs undercooked and inedible and poor timing of meals being deliverd. The staff were friendky enough, but didnt seem to really know what they were doing or serving. Really disappointin
3
We went to dinner there the day before our cruise and we found it was very crowded so it took us a long time to get served. Nevertheless the food was very good. I had a beer there and it was very expensive but when we were seated we were seated we felt quite relaxed
4
The food & serving portions will not disappoint . Thin crust oven baked pizza comparable to some of the best pizza across the waters at Marina Bay Sands. A relaxed ambiance and the service crew are 'on the ball'. Downside: overpriced beer compared to those at the Esplanade in the evening
4
This restaurant is located within Esplanade and it will be very crowded during dinner time. This is an Italian restaurant and we have ordered 2 pizza, 1 pasta, 1 risotto, 2 side dishes and 1 dessert. Due to very crowded, the waitress unable to hear us and we have to called out to them a few times before they realize it. The serving of food is a bit slow but still acceptable, they served our 2 side dishes first before serving the pizza and pasta. The food is delicious and nice but the it is a bit on the pricey side. As for the ambient, we enjoyed ourselves very much had a good chatting inside the restaurant while enjoying ourselves with the food. Highly recommended
3
We arrived for dinner on a Friday night and the restaurant was very busy. Unfortunately the level of service suffered due to this and staff apologised as the wait for our meals was lengthy. Also I ordered the pumpkin risotto and it had such a heavy garlic flavour and an unpleasant consistency that I couldn't eat it and we were not charged. In fairness the other meals ordered by our group including the marinara, and the fish of the day were fine - I might have been unlucky.Anyway, maybe try and avoid the busy times at this restaurant
4
We was a bit late for the reservation but staffs are so friendly that we get a seat immediately nonetheless. Food are delicious, I recommend the white wine pasta. Slightly noisy in the evening but we still can hear each other. Overall, we have a good time there
5
Just a cosy place to chill away from the hustle and bustle. To celebrate my best friend birthday as she has not visited esplanade for a long time.
5
Good for gathering with friends and family. Have a very nice and chill ambience. Might get crowded during peak periods thus it would be good to make a reservation beforehand.
4
Been here a few times. Service and food still as good. Tried the rucola pizza with the seared beef. Something new and it was good. My favourite still the truffle garlic fries but would better with more garlic. :-)
5
I absolutely loved it. It was awesome. There was an array of dishes to choose from and we were spoilt for choice.
1
Visited on 21 Feb 2017. Usually love their pastas, but both the cream sauce pastas were really bland yesterday. Ended up pouring lots of Tabasco and chilli flakes just so we could finish the food :-(
4
I brought my family and a friend to Supply and Demand for dinner. It was their first time.Loved the ambience and the food as usual though abit pricey. For that evening, the service was not at satisfactory level.1st was an indian waitress took our order, left. 5 minutes later, a Chinese waitress came back and said the order was not taken clearly so she had to write it again.2nd was whenever we waved our hands vigorously, either the service staff could not see us when they were pacing up and down OR 1 female staff rather cleared the table than to serve us.So far, the whole evening, only the tall guy served us attentively when we managed to catch him.3rd was we placed our order together. 2 sets of Augus beef, only 1 set came. We were almost done with our food, then the 2nd set of Augus beef arrived which kept me curious. The well done beef came earlier than the medium beef? My dad was so left out watching us eating... Still, it would not affect my review to visit this place again. Perhaps also update the Google search? Supply and demand had two outlets, 1 in Orchard and 1 in Esplanade facing the river view. It was hard for my husband and friend to find the outlet for a while. Overall, everything else was great
2
Not my first time at the restaurant. Food was good, but the air condition broke down on the day of the visit, leaving us perspiring madly in the restaurant. The restaurant also appeared to be under-staffed, and we had to wait more than 15 minutes before getting the waiters attention
4
I like how they have a wide variety of pastas available in serving and full portions. The dishes there were delicious, but slightly high for the price. It cost around $15++ (average) for a small tasting portion. 7 of us spent around $280 in total just ordering a tasting portion each, a drink each and 2 pizzas to share. But overall, the food was tasty.
5
We have never celebrated Valentines Day. Why buy a card containing words that doesn't convey your true love. Why share a restaurant full of lovers (sic) with tables crammed so close that you can nick a chip without any effort?So, we found ourselves in Singapore on the 14th Feb. The plan was to go grab a few drinks and think about food later. It was the (excellent) live duo on the roof top bar that got our attention. Having secured a table, we ordered two pisco sours, listened to some of the great music and, ordered two more drinks. Why not have a look at the food menu? The dishes arriving at the table next to us looked ideal finger food. We ordered 3 or 4 items and a pizza to pick at. All were perfect soakage and tasty. The staff were very friendly and 'on it' (we nipped in the following night for a quick drink and got a smile and welcome back handshake). Every credit to them after it started raining and everyone moved seat to under the canopy. All the running bar tabs had to be re allocated whilst maintaining service.Downstairs is more of a restaurant serving primarily Italian fare. probably not our scene but, it seemed busy.A very memorable and happy Valentines evening
4
We ate here during the summer on the rooftop. The view, sitting looking over the marina bay with the marina bay sands right on front. The meal was excellent, however, about half way through our dinner the band started to play, we could not here each other across the table which is not great when having a meal. Overall the experience was good, nice ambience, with a great view. Slightly let down with the music being too loud when dining
4
Was here for dinner with my family, the serve reasonable Italian food with good twist of local touches, I can not say this is truly Italian food but interesting way of presenting and propose their style. Prices are not cheap it worth to try
5
Special thanks for the wonderful indian waitress that serves us. She is very polite and provide good service. Overall the service crew has been very pleasant.
Serves wonderful truffle fries. Must try
4
It is a lovely venue and service is good. Food is good too but found a tad lack of salt. Food came punctually.
2
great for the view and drinks and bites. not for mains. Was expecting a little more Asian flair but was mostly italian
4
Just got there as the local vendors outside were not open, and could not make it better... I was in a rush and waitress Kala was so efficient and got my food on time (pasta and chicken) and I also tried the best strawberry iced tea I've had in my life
1
We passed by here this evening and asked if they were doing food till late and the waitress said 10:30pm. We said would we have to book and she said it should be ok up stairs, we didn't want to book as we had to go to a bus company that left us at the border and drove away with our stuff that morning. So when we arrived back at 10:10pm another waitress said they were closed last orders were at ten. I kindly asked that the next time people come asking they should tell them 10 not half 10. All she said was kitchen closed bye. Even though they've it printed on the window and it says it here in trip advisor 10:30pm it is not! We didn't get to eat here in the end obviously but the staff weren't nice!
2
Service was okay, however, food was really slow. They served the order to the wrong table but did not correct it. Forgot about one of the main dish and only served it half an hour later, after asking for it twice. The crowd was not too big although it was a Saturday, yet food came late. The food was average, and the staff were frequently checking if orders have arrived. Other than the ambiance, bad experience.
4
We had made reservations and got the choice for sitting either inside or outside. Since the outside was on the second level, with the nice view, we went for outside. Unfortunately, the menu was reduced to pizza, grills, sides and asian. Also not bad, bad I hoped for the risotto. Maybe next time. We went for a mix of pizza, dumplings and bread with humus. All nice, nicely presented and easy to share.
4
This restaurant is right in the middle of everything. It's along the water, surrounded by many other restaurants. It has both indoor and outdoor seating (top deck) which really connects it to the whole marina environment. It has such an inviting, relaxing, yet hip atmosphere with a warehouse/outdoor cafe feel, complete with string lights, wood accents, and brick walls.We were greeted immediately, and they offered to switch our table closer to the air condition fan when they saw how hot we were. The food came in less than 15 minutes. We ordered the risotto frute di mare and their signature pizza- La Mattina Dopo (The Morning After). It came with a soft egg in the center- that's their thing! It was pretty good.Perhaps the best aspect of this place, the only reason that motivated me to pick up my phone and write this review- was the kindness and attentiveness of the wait staff. Not only were they considerate with reseating us, but when we inquired how most people ate the pizza with the soft egg, she explained that people either leave it for the end or break it and drizzle the yolk. She went so far as doing it for us!The only reason why I did not award this place a full 5/5 was because I thought the risotto was a little undercooked (a bit too chewy) and the cheese on the pizza tasted as if it was under the warming lamps a little too long before it came to our table. But I still stick to my 4 stars-- all of the staff was so friendly and inviting, even though it was midnight when we came in. They're open til 3am

We stopped off at this bar one night after spotting it from the marina - it is situated upstairs. Filled with locals having a drink and a few tourists. Pretty noisy but a good atmosphere. We had a seat where we could watch the parade of people down below. Live band setting up for the night. Interesting spot to have a drink - we didn't try any of the food
3
food is awesome, service is average close to unsatisfactory, atmospere is a downfall as it is too noisy to begin with. and its not spacious at all.
4
The Garlic Truffle fries was really delicious. The tasting portion of the pasta was just right as well. Overall really a very good experience at Supply & Demand, will definitely patronize again soon in future.
4
I tried the mushroom pasta (al funghi) and went back on a different occasion just to eat it again. Good stuff :) the air-con can be cooler for indoor seating though!
4
Food was good, better than i expected. We ordered fries, pizza & pastas. Service was only average, staff were not so attentive to iur requests maybe becos it was crowded on weekend. Will return in near future
4
First time visit this restaurant and the food is good, with ambient and cozy environment. Should try their risotto.
4
The salted egg yolk chicken drumettes ($12) and the chorizo e rucola pasta ($20 for a full serving) are both thoroughly enjoyable, as is the potent tiramisu ($14) – though I prefer the cutely named Misadventures in a Jar ($16) which I had on a previous visit. What needs some improvement, though, is the service – the wait staff could have been a little more attentive. And while the selection of teas is impressive, the way the tea is infused in the teapot doesn't seem to work very well – which is evident from the light colour of what is supposed to be black tea
4
Ended up at Supply & Demand on NYE. There was a fixed price great value for the evening which included 3 courses and 3 drinks. Food was surprisingly good despite the restaurant being full. Service was good and staff helped out my necessary. Good views of Marina Bay and the firework display.
5
We went there for dinner on a weekday. The service was very quick and attentive, and the food was really tasty. But the things that sets this restaurant apart from the others are the location and the nice, relaxed atmosphere. Good value for - not too much - money
4
Supply and Demand offered an amazing selection in their menu. The food was extremely good. We had the truffle egg pizza which was superbly made. The egg was done medium and the runny texture worked well with the subtle truffle that did not overpower the pizza. A definite must try. We also had the bruschetta and the seafood marinara which was fresh and tasty, to say the least. Service was prompt and efficient. Despite the heavy crowd, they were able to manage well and we got our seats and food in a timely fashion. Kudos to the team
3
Food is tasty and worth the high price. Portions are big, so it is best to share. Cups are dirty though, but staffs quickly did a re-wash for us. An argument broke out between staffs while we were there but one staff came to our table and kindly apologise. Not sure if I'll visit this outlet again.. Oh, our garlic truffle fries had missing garlic which I love.
5
The food was great as usual. There was also a reminder for my reservation which i find it absolutely good for customers who tend to forget their reservations. Overall i love going to supply and demand.
4
Food was abit overprice. The atmosphere was quite good and the staff was really nice and offered to take photos.
5
Visited this place in search of good food and stumbled upon this by chance and weren't diassapointed at all.
We tried the Garlic Truffle fries which is must have if you visit. To top it up is the beautiful view of Marina Bay Sands.
5
Great service, good ambience, nice view. Great place to chill and chit chat! Must try pizzas - Morning after! Yummy!
3
I gotten chope confirmation email for the table @8pm as i leave a feedback that we can only reach that timing. But when i rch they say no such bookin.
4
They serve great pizzas and for the first time kids finished all their food. Loved the service and seating. Would love to come back here again soon
4
Overall, satisfied with the pizza and garlic truffle fries. Staff are understanding and attentive. Had a good time here.
3
food was served rather promptly considering the crowd. some drink orders were missed and reminders had to be given to the staff.
3
This is an easy review for me. The food is good and that is the most important factor. Now another important factor I find, is the service......Now the service here, is just strange!!!! Here I don't know if it is cultural or not, but I come from Europe and such service quality will doom a place to non-existence. I didn't feel welcomed at the place.. more like a nuisance as the everyone seemed to be to busy to look after the customers.Since I enjoy eating out, I will not go back to supply and demand at the esplanade branch
4
The salted egg drumlets were succulent and well fried without feeling greasy. The variety of pizzas was plenty - best of all, you can do half and half to try more flavours!Service was swift and efficient, with a bustling ambience for a good night out with friends
3
Ambience is good, food is overated and expensive.
Morning after pizza is nice
Aglio olio doesnt taste good
Truffle fries serving is good
3
Staff Dante was excellent, though this cannot be said for some of the other staff, who were pretty rude when handling our order and checking my reservation.
4
been to supply and demand at sommerset and its a bit hidden so in a busy weekend you can find a table here. serves great pizza and pasta and wide variety of wine to choose from.
5
Food was above average. Atmosphere and ambience was good and most importantly, the service was excellent!
4
Their signature garlic fries is very yummy.
All sides serving size is alright.
Only main full size is big portion.
I suggest if you not sharing with anyone, should select the tasting size.
4
Nice location.. good choice of food .. good service.
Many options for vegetarians.
Awesome starters. Must try - cauliflower fritti and polenta fritti.
A tad disappointed by the desserts.
Will definitely visit again!
4
Came here for after work drinks with colleagues recently and enjoyed a few beers whilst admiring the view over the city from the rooftop bar. Friendly service and ok snacks for food.
5
Right on the river, where we dined and watched the evening turn into night. Not expensive, and good menu
2
Chose for our Dept end of year party, so a group of 14+3 kids. Ordered food one day in advance to make it easy. Hard to get attention of wait staffFirst meal came out on time, last two meals a good 45 mins later when most people had finished. From ordering a bottle of wine until it arriving and being opened took 20 mins plus. Place looks good, and it's lively so for smaller groups should be fine but wouldn't want to get stuck at the far end of the deck where service is slo
4
This is at their Orchard Gateway branch. Decor looked laid back and inviting. The waitstaff were polite and efficient when called, but did not go out of their way to be accessible, indeed spending most of their time hanging out together at one end of the restaurant. Although the restaurant was only half full at the time (we were early), the food came in dribs and drabs - we got an appetiser followed by a salad (which was one of the 3 we ordered as main courses), then the second salad after around 5-10 minutes, and finally the last salad with the second appetiser around 15-20 minutes or so after that. The kitchen certainly didn't look overwhelmed, so it might have been a sequencing issue?Having said that, the food was decent and right-priced for a casual restaurant of this sort. The salads were pretty tasty, and it was thoughtful that the dressings were served on the side, so that you could add as much or as little of the dressing to your salad based on your preference. The calamari fritti was nice, and was accompanied by a decent tomato based sauce. The salted egg fries came with chorizo and raw red onion and was fried with salted egg yolks and curry leaves - a nice take on traditional fries. Overall a decent place for brunch, but perhaps needs a little more staff training. Might return to try their meat courses another day.
4
The food was great and portions were just right for 3 of us to share. Too bad they were out of Moscato. Should stock up more. Other than that the staff were friendly though I think they were quite short handed too.
5
Wide selection of pizza and pasta. Service staff was able to give good recommendations. Food portion a little small though.
4
Didn't think that italian food would appeal much to me till I tried this. Food and drinks were good, ambience was good and staffs were friendly too! Food portion was rather huge, good enough for 2 to share if ordering some sides too.
4
food was okay. Ordered truffle garlic fries, pricey in my opinion, was comparable to a main dish. Tasted okay, truffle taste could have been more. Service staff do not really pay close attention, had to wave and signal for some time before they came
4
Enjoyable evening out with friends. Service was great, food was great....no complaints! View is nice and there is a good vibe being down by the water.
5
Have been looking up this restaurant from other review websites which gave horrible ratings. But i am glad that i tried it with a friend of mine. Decor n music is on point. Just that service is slow due to lack of manpower but they balance it out by giving excellent services. Went there on 10 nov to have dinner, there is these 2 servers (dint get their name it was peak hour n they runnin like chicken without heads) 1 korean lady w spec and 1 indian lady w spec. Very thoughtful , kind and informative. Especially the korean girl we were just asking curiously what brand the tea is from. She answered and after 10 min when she is not busy she bring out the packaging n showed us and explain to us patiently. Very very good service. Definately coming back agai
4
Orchard Central outlet - First time here for dinner with friends. Four of us girls shared the petite cold platter, salted yolk fries, burmese salad, angus beef & parma ham pizza. All were good! And the food were served very quickly! They have a huge selection of wine and tea too. Atmosphere was cosy and we were there till closing time. Service was great too. Rather small place so do make reservations in advance
4
the fries are must try. the pastas are all fantastic. just go for the flavor you like. never disappoint. staff has to be much faster in getting the bill. 10 min or more is ridiculously absurd. the seats are too close to other tables now. no privacy. the ice water is no longer iced. it's just pre prepared bottled water that is way below previous standard
5
We had dinner at Supply and Demand last night and it was delightful. A great atmosphere at the roof top bar looking over the marina to Marina Sands. We started with bruschetta, then we had the salmon afrocatto and I had the satays that come out on a little pot stand with a grill over a tea light. This was perfect as they did bring it before we had finished the salmon, but they didn't go cold with the flame. My husband had a pizza which was delicious as well. The drinks are expensive but good variety and some unusual ones as well. The servers are pleasant and the music is good. Definitely worth a visit
4
I was really surpriced to find out that the pizza in this place is really nice, quite close to the pizza in italy, as i live in italy i can judge a nice pizza, i mean around the world i try many pizzas and this one is let's say in a good view, the only thing is that the restaurant is a little bit expensiv
4
Food was great. Pizza had generous toppings. Service was fab even though their dinning was 80% full on Thursday night.
4
Nice local food even variety is limited, friendly staff, great view to the Marina Bay, evening time is best to visit.
5
Good quality food and quick service. The place was crowded with people but intimate enough for a couple date. Their pizzzas were great!
4
Great food. Food is really delicious! And the whole restaurant whole pretty nice. Good location as well.
5
It feels so great when I step in the restaurant, the ambience is so good, thumb up. Especially when you dine at the alfresco, the view is simply breathtaking! Overlooking the esplanade and Singapore river with a nice cold beer in your hand. Great!
4
I personally like this place as they serve good Italian dishes. Ordered a risotto this time and it was good. Wife ordered pasta. Took some time to deliver our food cos the restaurant was crowded on a Saturday evening. Better to make a reservation. Booking only taken up to 7.00pm. After that no reservation.
5
My husband & I stumbled on this outdoor bar the night we arrived in Singapore. We were strolling around the bay & spotted the second storey bar. After having a drink we decided to stay for some dinner & ordered some share plates. Very delicious & reasonably priced drinks for Singapore.
5
Love the way they have tasting portions for their pasta so that everybody can try a bit of everything without feeling overwhelmed, especially if they weren't crazy about the taste. Especially liked the aglio olio/white wine pastas and the morning after pizza. The carbonara was too cheesy for our liking. Great service though
5
this is my second time dining here, and this time, it was to celebrate my boyfriend's birthday with a few of our friends. I've seen a lot of reviews about their bad services on their Facebook, but decided to go ahead and make a reservation as I didn't experience anything like this the last time I dined there. and I've to say their services are unlike what I've read; it's as great as their food!I couldn't get a cake elsewhere in the mall prior, so very thankfully.. they do have cakes on their menus. bonus: they provide their customers candles to go with the cake for birthdays, and even offered to light it up :-)p/s: shout out to their cauliflower fritti (my boyfriend loves it) and black forest cake (this is my personal favourite)! ^_
4
Has visited Supply and Demand on the most tiring day of my visit to Singapore .. As a tired family we walked into this place for some exciting food.. And must say the service levels, food and drinks didn't disappoint at all. We say on the first floor which has an amazing view of the esplanade !
4
Had a great time, went with friends.
Great starters interesting mains and fantastic deserts.
Chicken is halal
4
S&D never disappoints in their food! this was the 4th or 5th new group i've brought to S&D, and it was thumbs up again. it was quite a busy evening and probably not enough staff; they were a little harried but surprisingly conscientious -- i had requested for tomato ketchup but it didn't come, and i thought probably it won't turn up at all (which is very common in other eateries, especially when staff are busy); but was very pleasantly surprised when the waiter did eventually come with the sauce and apologized for the delay :) great food and ambience, always 1 of my fave venues
2
We usually do not visit Italian restaurants when abroad and this place doesn't specifically states it is an Italian restaurant.We tried local dishes but the quantity of food was too poor for the price we were charged.So we sipped a cocktail and walked out of this place still hungry.The setting is beatiful, though, with views on the Marina bay sands. The rooftop terrace is very romantic
5
Me and my wife being ardent italian food lovers, are always on the look out for new and exciting places to try pastas and pizzas. So when we heard the reviews about Supply and Demand, it didn't take much time to decide the place for our next date. The pizza we ordered was thin, crispy and supremely delicious with the right balance of cheese and the toppings. The smooth and creamy carbonara pasta we ordered also didn't disappoint. The only down point might be the cost, which is on slightly higher side.
5
The best thing about this place that I liked was their opening hours. They are open till 3 am on Fridays and Saturdays, so you can head there for a delicious drinks and dinner even after hours.They have rooftop bar with live music as well, but they do not serve all of their menu items upstairs, so if you're there for the food, be seated downstairs.I loved their selection of drinks, all kinds of alcoholic and non alcoholic, and a separate wine menu. The drinks we ordered were good.Our starters were pretty fresh and delicious, I loved their home made dip.They have a huge variety for Pastas and Pizzas. I loved the Creamy Pesto Spaghetti. They have a range of options for Vegetarians as well. I hoped to find Lasagna and spinach Ravioli also, it wasn't there, but nonetheless, the pastas we ordered were more than Delicious. They have a 'tasting' size and a 'full' size. For me, after the starters and the drinks, 'Tasting' size was more than enough.Overall a very good dining option at the esplanade waterfront. Thank you for serving till late, I'm a night owl on weekends, and I hate the places which close at 11...:DThumbs Up!
1
Worse meal I have had in a while. Very disappointing. Think we really missed out tonight...!The menu was extensive and a bit confused. The chicken in the chicken salad was tough, the cheese on the fries was the squeezey stuff you get at the cinema (!). Both my friends had a fish in broth they described as fishy and meaty...We skipped on dessert
4
As most restaurants in the center, this one was overpriced for the portions. We had to buy two salads per person to get a decent portion of greens. However they were tasty and the quality of the food was very good. I had a Birmanese. Tea lesf salad, loved it, but could not sleep afterwards ( to be avoided if you are coffein sensitive). Still, I would recommend this restaurant. The view is nice and the place quiet
4
With an option of indoors and outdoors seating, Supply and Demand provides good ambiance be it for a family meal or drinks with friends on the rooftop. An extensive list of appetizers, pizzas, pastas and desserts ensures everyone has a choice. Very extensive tea menu for a restaurant. Service was swift and friendly albeit the waitresses were eyeing our table if we had finished our food at the end of our meal and started clearing our table. We were waiting for our desserts and not ready to leave just yet. Reservation is preferred to secure a seat
5
we went on a thursday night, around 9:30 pm to have pizzas. We had the spicy salaami and mushroom pizza. (half n half) with iced n spiced strawberry tea. The roof top deck has a magnificient view of the bay area. Singapore by night is to be seen from here while enjoying a tall glass of beer after a hot and humid day in the sun. The pizzas were par excellence and the service was fair , considering the pressure of the large number of demanding customers. Total cost w/o drinks SGD 14 per hea
1
Went to roof top bar for an after work drink with a colleague. We ordered cocktails and some bites. All went well till the waiter "a man with coloured blond hair" came with the bill where we just start our drink and bites. I said, it's 8.00 pm, are you closing? No, just explained that so because so many run bills they have to close out. ??? There were literally 2 tables on roof top bar, and we had a cocktail and 2 bites for a total of 75$. I said do you mind to come later, there is no rush, isn't it? At the end the guy explained that many customer went out without paying. Very insulting, we are above 40 years old, dressing business attire and roof top where stairs are narrow to run. Seriously? Do we look like thieves? Insulting !!!! By the way calamari are chewy and bruschetta is not with onion please! Terrible never again or fire this guy
4
The food are nice especially Agliolio pasta and cheese fries. Agliolio pasta I ordered tester size which was just nice to eat. I feel normal size of pasta with side dish make me feel too full and end up can't finish all.
4
Was quite nice having some Rempayak on my Caesar salad. Atmosphere nice and relaxed. Cool decor and music. Will definitely come back
3
They also have another branch at Capitol Piazza. Pizzas are good, trffule fries large portion but i prefer shoestring fries to steak fries. Pasta with clams is tasty. Decor is nice and comfy.
1
It's hard to remember when I had worse service in a restaurant. We were there on a Saturday night, about 8pm. Service was very slow. It took an hour to get our drinks, by which time we didn't care that two of them were wrong. Meanwhile we'd already almost finished our meal, which was decent enough in quality, but certanly not worth the price. The servers here didn't appear to care about the fact we had a bad experience, and were completely unapologetic.The venue itself is nice enough, but the service shocking
4
Quiet location on the outer part of the Esplanade facing the water front. The pizzas were very tasty. We had the Morning After (their signature pizza) and Fajita. The squid ink risotto and pasta al granchio were both good but my favourite was the cream-less carbonara classico. Don't miss the chunky cheese fries
1
The other night, I dined on the rooftop of Supply and Demand. I've been there several times before as the food is decent and the view upon the marina relaxing on a pleasant day. On this particular late afternoon, everything was business as usually until I signed for the check; thereafter, I was utterly applaud by the ride, abusive and derogatory behavior of one particular waitstaff member. This waitstaff brought my credit card for signature. I signed (which takes roughly a second) and proceeded to hand the billfold back to the waitstaff who was standing right next to us but was zoned out into no man's land. I held the billfold for so long to the point where I said in a loud and stern voice, "Hey!" The waitstaff then proceeded to scold me and stated that it is not nice to do that in Singapore. Fair ... I could have been softer in tone as he was standing right next to me but was oblivious and fully inattentive at that moment. I'll own that part. But what happened thereafter was astonishing. Then it gets even worse to the point of physically abusing two guests. As we walked down the staircase to the exit as we were on the rooftop, the same waiter was coming up the stairs. As he approached up as we were walking down, he sped up and ended up bumping both of us hard on the shoulders with his shoulders as if he was checking us during a rugby match. I was going to just let it go, but a few steps out of the restaurant I realized that it was such inappropriate and malicious behavior that the management and guests should be aware. I asked for the manager. Speaking with the manager on duty (who was polite and amenable), was a good experience. He called down the waitstaff and the staff member once again approached us with an aggressive tone getting into our face with, "You want an apology from me ... you're not going to get one!" Then he proceeded to say that he didn't see us and that's why he bumped into us (the stairwell is only a meter wide). And then stomped off. As nice as the manager on duty was, he didn't have the authority to take any action as he informed us that the restaurant manager was on vacation for another week or so and would have her contact us upon her return. I've never posted a bad review of a restaurant as I just chalk it up to a personal bad experience whether food, service, etc. But this time the waitstaff's behavior was so appalling disrespectful and abusive that I felt that the experience should be shared for everyone to read.I do hope that the owners of the establishment take stern and appropriate action as physical abuse is beyond unacceptable
1
Orchard gateway on Good Friday: queue to get the attention of the waiter to get a table. Mind you, not queueing to get a table, but to get noticed by a waiter. Then waiting to order. When the first dish came waiting for the second dish to arrive at a different time... more waiting. Not very good octopus dish. Frankly: taste at all. More waiting to get the attention of the waiter to get the cheque. Waiter brings the cheque and tells me to queue at the cashier to pay... I exploded.... What a terrible service. I already didn't like the service from the first minute, and they kept it up until the last minute. Then the food quality matched the service....Sorry. This place is simply not recommended. Bad service and food to match
4
Supply and Demand never fail to dish out good food. We both ordered pastas and both out pasta came out well. The white sauce in my pasta was thick and creamy, which I am particular about in an arrabriata. Our smoked salmon burschetta was also well done and served. Impressive and would recommend to anyone craving an Italiano meal.
5
Travelers and tourists if you LOVE the taste of Italian. It's my 1st time to dine in this restaurant. I prefer you go here to this restaurant because they offer the BEST and GREAT meal. They offer pasta, pizza, soup and salads and they have great DESSERTS too! :) The pasta that I like is the Seafood Marinara the taste was really really good. :) it's a fine dining restaurant but the price is so affordable. If you LOVE eating and to dine you must fly now and go to Singapore. :) I like the ambience of the restaurant it was simple, elegant, modern, clean and overlooking Marina Bay Sands. I also like their set-up and their decorations it catches my eye.
4
Offer lots of pasta selection. Serve two portion: tasting and full. I choose the tasting portion since I want to try the pizza also. Aglio Olio taste OK, the creamy mushroom sauce taste really good, the cream is not too thick and yummy till the last bite.
3
Taking picture around marina bay, and try food at supply and demand restaurant for the 2nd time~~📷📷👍👍
3
Very busy Friday evening. Wait to get served was quite long . The food once it arrived was ok but nothing special for the price. Nothing to really get excited about or to moan about hence the average rating.
5
Nice restaurant which serves good Italian dishes. Lots of choices and prices are normal. You get quality food and its well prepared like it should be. Great friendly staff too. That and the location makes it worth to visit.
4
With every type of food available including a fusion pasta, the Thai-inspired curry without any coconut milk, was excellent and one of the best I have ever had.
4
Great little Italian restaurant & bar that we visited a few times during the Singapore Grand Prix weekend. We had some great pasta dishes and very good cocktails.
5
This is one of my favourite place to dine in town. I really like their ambience of the restaurant - rustic but also looking simple and modern overlooking Marina Bay Sands especially at night it's pretty good. For food wise I tried their The Morning After pizza, Carbonara, and some cakes and they were all delicious. Service is also good, friendly and fast
4
Very tasty arrabbiata with prawns, my friend and I could've easily devoured a second plate! The Morning After Pizza was less impressive. I don't know, maybe I'm just not a big fan of runny egg in the middle of my pizza? Either way, it wasn't impressive. But the arrabbiata was a must-try for lovers of tomato-based pastas
4
Came here to celebrate our 4th Anniversary. Requested a more quiet table and was given a table nearer to the corner with a good view of bay sands and the CBD. Wife and I ordered Black angus ribeye and a couple of drinks. We ordered them medium rare and the doneness was just right when it came to our table. I would not say that this is a great place for steaks but it was good value for money. I understand that their pizzas and pastas are really worth a go and I would consider trying them out the next time.I have to commend the waiters and waitresses on service. They were attentive and prompt in answering to our needs and request. My wife and I had a great time dining at the restaurant and enjoying the view from where we were seated

We are on our honeymoon and have spent two weeks in Bali and wanted to spend a couple of days in Singapore before heading home. We have tried a lot of different cuisines during our stay and have never been disappointed until now. It took ages to get served, the mental chairs were really uncomfortable and the menu options average. We ordered pizza and seafood pasta, nothing demanding but our first taste of western food in just over two weeks. The pasta turned up. Portion size was fair but the pasta was slightly too Al dente. To be fair, they could have used the 15 minutes we had to wait for the pizza to arrive to cook it properly. When w e asked the waiter why there was such a long wait between the meals arriving, he said it was because they have separate kitchens. No apology or remorse. There are much better places to eat and for the price we paid ($S 85) the meal was outrageously overpriced for the food and service we received. The pizza was the only redeeming point of the whole mea
4
We were the last ones to place the order at 11 p.m yet the place was buzzing at that time. Great location, they also have roof top seating. We ordered a pizza and chicken wings and the food was great! A good place for a couple of drinks and dinner with friends
4
I was in Singapore on business and came across this neat little bistro . I can't speak to the food but they have a nice rooftop bar with a killer view of the harbor. Prices were also very reasonable by Singapore standards!
4
We have been there last Saturday after the National Day Parade practice when it was really packed. I have to commend the staff - it was obviously stressful but nevertheless we have no complaints about the service.It's a decent place for a good dinner and I was very positively surprised with their pizza: thin crust, appropriate amount of toppings, not oily, and nicely spiced
4
Service is not the best, with the waiters running all over the place taking orders from different groups. Bar can be quite noisy when the big groups start to show up. But amazing views and pretty okay food. Value to money for a great chill out place

This is a retrospective review. I was at the Esplanade branch late last year on a Friday night. We called to make a booking 2 days before however when we arrived we were told that there was no such booking. (Why would I bother making such things up especially at a packed restaurant on the busiest night of the week)?! We were merely waved away before I could put my point across that it was their fault for not giving us a 'reservation number' when we called. Not only were they unapologetic, they made us feel as though we were trying to cut the queue!Fast forward to June 2015. My friend and I patronised the Orchard central branch. We arrived at 11:30AM (opening time) but was told that the kitchen was not ready to serve. We asked if we could have a seat inside and don't mind waiting - and was told a curt NO. We were finally seated at 11:45AM. Food was not bad, nothing to write home about..... but the service really set the mood for us.I would have given this an average rating, but service is integral to the dining experience, and you just ruined it
4
We had the morning after pizza and the carbonara at the Orchard Gateway branch.Like that the carbonara is without cream and has a bit of sourish taste so that it doesn't get too overwhelming halfway through the eat.The pizza was pretty good. A place that I would return. However it is a relatively busy place, so not for a romantic night out. Service staff were polite and prompt with their service depots handling a crowd
1
We went for Sunday lunch - one pasta dish one pizza, one bottle of dreadful white wine $107.Good points:the pizza was pretty good, thought the base was not exactly 'fluffy' as the menu promised.Not sure if this counts a good point, but the standup row between the chef and the manager was entertaining, though made for a bit of an atmosphere among the staff.Bad points:We ordered a bottle. They served a bottle of wine which had already been started! I've never ever experienced that before.Just banging the replacement wine down and walking away.The wine was nasty - not worthy of the price tag even bearing in mind Singapore prices.Ok, the pasta sauce I chose came under 'olive oil-based, but it was really, really greasy. I was glad I only ordered the 'taster'.I had finished my main course before my wife's arrived. However, this is typical Singapore service, so I suppose they are only following what a lot of other restaurants do - still drives me nuts!They close the restaurant at 3pm and you didn't feel that they wanted you to linger. A warning when we came in would have made us reconsider eating there.Service was unfriendly (might have been due to staff row), and with one waiter positivity surly. Get another job, mate! We will not be coming back or recommending it. There are so many better place to eat for the money
4
Found this restaurant after a walk aroubd ths esplanade, bit hidden in a small street but well known.. staff is friendly and accurate. The food came fast, maybe bit too fast since i got maindish already while i was still eating the starter but it was almost closingtime so guess they wanted to go home. Food was good, quality was good and wine was also ok. Would come back when im there again

Here for a fren's birthday celebration and we had a whole lot of food and drinks!! Both the truffle fries and avocado ice cream was heavenly and what's interesting as well is the cocktails that they have.... Tom yum cocktail which tasted just like tom yum soup but it's ice cold and alcohol infused!!! And if you are a Milo fan, the also have a 'milo dinosaur' cocktail which was awesome!! So be adventurous and try the various cocktails that they have!!

The food is nice. For pastas, they have two types of serving... 'tasting' and 'full'. Tasting is like half of full. But if u top up another 3 or 4 bucks u can get the full. The full itself was little. So dun bother with the tasting serving. Juz go for the full. The Salmon Bruschetta is nice and a chef's recommendation. We waited for 30 min to be seated. Restaurant is very crowded on weekends. No booking on Fri and weekends. But u can make a reservation when u go there and go shopping... The restaurant will call u once a place is available for u

location - orchard gatewaypremise - nicely done and reasonably good number of seats for plenty of pple.crowd - many beautiful faces to see :) mainly late teens and also young office workersstaff - too busy to be friendly but did the job wellfood - not too bad but can be better.verdict - 4/5 rating given due to location and premise and crowd. Food is not really a go-back-to-resto standard in my opinio

We had pizza on the upper deck overlooking the Marina Bay. The food was good, service also. We forgot our shopping bag but were able to collect it two days later.

We attended this bar and restaurant on a recommendations of our friends hotel's concierge. The roof top bar was ok but there are heaps better places in singapore with better views. Service was poor. Downstairs it was not much better. There was simply not enough staff for the number of patrons. However we were astounded by the popularity of the place as the food was at best average and the price of two bottles of wine led to a very large bill. Sadly in this case the concierge was wrong and it would be better not to follow this recommendatio

Food average. Lacked seasoning, missed starter, denied that I asked for one, did not offer second drink or desert. No pepper or salt offered. Given bill whilst eating. Mains placed on table before finishing the single starter that arrived. Pizza base soggy.I would rate this poor but the cost of the meal means it must get a terrible

As with London, when you have a service fee included it means the staff are more commonly lazy, disengaged and disinterested in their customers.We received our meal and within 2 minutes the waitress came over and gave us our bill, although we hadnt asked for it. I found this odd and rude, so I asked whether this was common practice (which if it was in Singapore then I could have accepted it). This is not common practice and happened because they were due to close in 15 minutes time. Again, not a problem but I explained that this should have been made clear to us when we walked in so we could have made a decision as to whether we wanted to eat here or elsewhere and take our time. The response was a mutter and a face as though to say they couldnt care less. I asked to speak to the manager, Redhwan, who gave me a similar response although he said he was sorry, in a manner that showed he also didnt care. Not looking for any money off, just some sort of genuine understanding to the lack of common sense in what happened. $80 dollars later including the service charge for a meal that we could have taken more time over at McDonalds, in Singapore, for Pasta x2, 1x Erdinger and 1x Small Wine, in Marina Bay - SHOCKING!! Cheers Supply & Demand for making our last meal in Singapore a memorable experience...it pains me to not use any profanity whilst I write this review.Rant over with, thank goodness for feedback forum

Ate here with friends and family (8 total) after the conclusion of a Singapore River Cruise (we disembarked between the Flyer and Colours by the Bay.) Most of us ordered a variety of pizzas, but there were two who ordered pasta dishes. The pasta dishes were generous servings (especially for kids) and the pizzas were a big hit. The restaurant was quite busy and the layout is quite cozy, making it loud and difficult to hear when it is busy. Our server was attentive and friendly. Would visit again

Open casual restaurant with a cosy feel. The table arrangement is somewhat tight and the seats by the window have loose cushions which are not very comfortable to lean on because they keep slipping. The pizza was great! We had the vegetarian one which exceeded this meat lover's expectations - combination of bell peppers, avocado, tomatoes, mushrooms on a thin crispy, not hard, crust. Give the garlic truffle fries a miss - A bit too thick and way too oily. Couldn't quite taste the garlic or the truffle. I liked the cheese slices on top though. The teas come in 50 delicious flavours and cost a hefty $9.90 a pot but it seemed worth that price - Came in a glass pot with a tea light to keep warm and a biscuit and a melt in the mouth chocolate cupcake! The tiramisu was superb and must not be missed. Service was helpful and polite.

After having explored the surroundings of the Esplanade Theater, we decided to have dinner in one of the many nice options close to it. Our choice was the Supply and Demand Modern Italian Peruvian Bistro & Rooftop Bar, for the following reasons: its informal and cool atmosphere attracted us to it, not to mention the fact we love Italian and Peruvian food; the staff was friendly; the costumers seemed to be enjoying a very nice time; the menu was interesting and the wine list offered labels from many different countries. It was a very good and nice choice

Went here with two friends on Chinese New Year eve, because we wanted to be close to Marina fireworks. Got a table inside and were served very promptly. Had a selection of tapas style dishes and some white wine, which were excellent. Then we went upstairs to the bar area for drinks and the view. However, one of our friends wanted a coffee and the staff were adamant that coffee was only served downstairs. A very stupid rule and stubborn attitude to customer service, which somewhat spoilt the occasion

This place is located right on the Bay Area. the views from the top terrace are amazing, cute and homey feeling.The food is very good, specially the fried calamari and the Samosas (veggies).......prices are a bit out of the ball park for such a casual place...but hey it's Singapore!Service is slow.....I mean SLOW, so bring an extra dose of patience and relax overlooking the Marina Bay views.No management in sight.....employees are young Nd on their own pace, kind of a pitty for the cooks that are busting their chops to get good food out

The menu sounded authentic but the final product was a let-down. I ordered a main sized aglio olio with shrimp pasta. When it arrived I told the waitress i had ordered a main not an entree size. She replied that all of their main sized pasta's are weighed at 150g! I thought it was a joke but she was dead serious! The shrimp looked like fishing bait and was dry, tough and tasteless. The toppings on the pizza were not very generous although the pizza base was tasty. They seem to be doing everything right except for the food. Nice ambience but we definitely won't waste our money again

I like the concept of the restaurant! So many food options! Good place to hang out with friends as you can order a few dishes and share. Staff were friendly and very helpful to make recommendations. Definitely will go again!

In reference to the Esplanade outlet, granted it's situated in a tranquil spot, be that as it may, the cuisine is rather insipid and uninspiring...
The staff seem to be as a whole in a bewildered state, thoroughly withdrawn..

Cool location but food was very average and staff were rude! Here's hoping they were just having a bad night.

Had dinner with my family last Friday, the ambience of this restaurant is very nice. The food was good too and prices are treasonable. Would definitely go there again.

The sign says "be back at 545pm" I'm the first in queue and I'm still wasn't served till 6pm. The staff were walking around and only removed the signage at 6pm. The food... not good. Ordered pasta. One of it was the carbonara, thought it wouldn't go wrong, but it was dry and taste worse than coffee shop western food. The only nice food ordered is the truffle fries. I will not visit this place again

We booked a table at the Orchard Gateway branch 2 weeks in advance as our previous visit was unsuccessful - "There are 70 people in the queue ahead of you," exclaimed the waiter. With a reservation, we were immediately brought to our table. The placement of tables is rather crampy and really too close to each other. I would expect a larger frame person to have issues weaving in and out. The menu covered appetisers, a wide range of pizza and pasta and an acceptable drinks menu. We tried the Morning After and Pepperoni pizzas - great taste, not too much tomato paste and generous amount of toppings. The pasta, on the other hands, was very disappointing. We had the Aglio Olio with Shrimps and the Carbonara Classico and both pastas were under-cooked with hardly any ingredients for both pastas. Would I go back again? It's and Yes and a No. Yes - the pizzas are great, staff attentive (though thoroughly stressed), the reservation system is a breeze. No - waiting time is at least 45 mins without a reservation, pastas need to be improved (we can't just eat pizzas there, right?), claustrophobic atmosphere with tightly space table arrangements, loud surround sound ..

I had been to the Esplanade location and thought that this place would be alright for a casual lunch. But the Orchard location yielded a disappointing experience.We were seated outside of the restaurant in an extended seating area. We waited for a long time before a waitress showed up to take the orders. Most of the time the waiters and waitresses were in the main seating area. Throughout the whole lunch the waitress came by to the area once. The rest of times my husband had to walk over to the main area to ask them to come over to take our orders and give us the bills. Really if the restaurant owner was not ready to staff for the extended seating area, they should not have the extended space to begin with. We ordered beer and pasta. Beer was served as a big bottle of it without a mug. Pasta was undercooked. It was awkward sitting in the mall's hallway and the music is blasting and impossible for a conversation. When asked if the music volume can be lowered, the answer was "The store owner explicitly stated that no staff is allowed to change the music volume. " It was so loud that we had to go somewhere else to have our afternoon drinks even though there are drinks to offer in the restaurant. I don't think I will go back again.

Is a Sunday visited branch at Somerset. Luckily was not pack but seems to be fullhouse. we waited for about 2 minutes before attended by the hostess. We were seated with pax of four. Menu was on the table, slightly dirty with some oil liked stained on the menu. We ordered 2 pasta and a large pizza. portion was slightly too much. Too hungry, otherwise it could be jut nice for a smaller pizza. Food was great, most of the item was make from fresh ingredient. I ordered a Pomarola which the chef shortfall 1 ingredient for me. Inform to the staff and was served within 5 minutes.Overall still satisfied with the meal experience. will be back agai

We've been to both locations, on Esplanade and at Orchard Gateway. The pizzas are very good and are a good price. The pasta are a bit disappointing, not in the taste but rather in the portion size: you can choose between a tasting portion or a regular portion. I ordered regular and it was so small, I can't help but wonder what the taster size looks like! Hence the pasta are overpriced, simply because of what you get for what you pay. The service is a bit chaotic, at both locations. Note: the tables at the back of the Orchard Gateway Location have a compartment for your belongings, which probably looked nice in the catalog, but makes for very little leg room and thus they are very uncomfortable to sit at, particularly for tall people. So get a table near the front. The rooftop bar at Esplanade is great, but get there early if you want a seat

we visited this restaurant on our last night in Singapore and were able to walk straight in and be seated without a reservation. the restaurant was fairly busy for a Thursday evening and the rooftop bar was fairly full. We sat inside on the ground floor. The menu was extensive and we had the chicken satay to start and pizza as a main. We were so full that we didn't even bother with dessert even though the menu was tempting!The service was very quick and the waitress was very helpful in saying what was popular on the menu and helping us to choose our meals. The soft drinks also came in funky glasses which were like chemical lab beakers which I thought was pretty cool.Only slight negative from our visit was that they began to start preparing the tables for the next day whilst we were still eating which was a little off putting but I guess it needed to be done but they could have waited until the tables close by were empty.I would definitely go back and eat here if I was ever back in Singapore

We had reserved an area on the rooftop for about 20+ people. The place is very nicely situated on the Esplanade ,very convenient for everyone. The food was nice.Open air with drinks and friends company made it a nice place to hang out.

Liked: Great wine & food. Perfect atmosphere for a relaxed Friday evening!
Staff can be a little more pleasant.

THIS IS A REVIEW ABOUT SUPPLY & DEMAND AT ORCHARD GATEWAY, SOMERSETWhat are the odds of me going back to a cafe so soon, within a couple of weeks, to eat again? I mean, out of so many others out there? Well yes I did, to try other interesting things on the menu.I ordered an appetizer of Handmade Spicy Satay Skewers (SGD$12.00) simply because I thought it interesting to see traditional local streetfood fusioned into an Italian bistro restaurant. Grilled to a smoky deliciousness with marinated, tender chicken cubes, these piping hot meat-on-sticks were actually served on a mini stove. It was really adorable (oh dear, should have taken a shot of this stove).Then I had a Shrimp and Avocado Salad (SGD$16.00) - look at the buttery soft and generous portions of avocado slices! Nothing beats a melt-in-your-mouth, smooth type of vegetables combined with bouncy, sweet fresh shrimps to make one's day a refreshing, happier one. The best part is that this salad uses Thai-inspired spicy citrus dressing and Thai vinaigrette, so this is not your average shrimp + avocado salad.*Sidney's Beef Pepperoni Pizza (usual price SGD$18.00), consisting of beef pepperoni, oregano, mozarella and tomato sauce. The crust is thin and crispy, the first bite already eliciting feelings of immense satisfaction. The overall getup of the toppings was pretty standard, really, nothing that stood out immensely, but it tasted good as a homely, wholesome, comfort food.Overall, this is still a nice place for nice food. The service leaves lots of room for improvement though.For full review and more photos, please feel free to visit:http://thearcticstar.blogspot.sg/2014/10/dinner-at-demand-supply-orchard-gateway.htm

Went to the outlet at Orchard Gateway. Its always good to go early if you do not have any reservations. Passed by and decided to drop in for dinner and was lucky to get a seat even though the restaurant was not filled. The staff mentioned all of them were reserved. Ordered pizza and carbonara. Its difficult to get the staff's attention sometimes because they are all over the place. The food was good though. So made up for the slower service. So if you really want to try, suggest that you make a reservation. Otherwise you may have to wait

The food is good not mind blowing but acceptable and reasonable price for Singapore. Two main complaints, firstly you can't book a table after 7pm - why? Secondly the service - we were coming towards the end of our main course when we were presented with the bill. No advance warning it just arrived. When we asked if it was possible to get a dessert we were told they were closing. This was at approx 9:30 pm despite there website saying they were open until 1am. Why can Singapore not get customer service???

We booked online and had a reservation at 6pm (that was confirmed) as we were going to see a show at the theatre next door. We arrived on time and was told that the restaurant was not open and that we could sit outside on the terrace. No drinks were offered while we waited. At 615pm we went back inside and the waiter said they were still busy setting up. Umm no they weren't they were still sitting at a large table at the back having their dinner? No apologies just said we had to wait. We waked straight out and went to the hawkers stalls next door. I have never experienced bad and rude service like this before

I visited Supply & Demand on a Friday night. We had heard a lot about the place before we headed there and we were lucky to get a table without reserving one beforehand! It's a very nice place with a relaxed atmosphere and a great view - perfect for gatherings. The waiter who served us was very polite and efficient too. We spent about $18 each on a pint of beer (Peroni) after GST and service charge. Their happy hour promotion does not apply on Friday. As we only went there after dinner, we did not order any food but we most certainly will when we visit again next time

While this place can offer good views because of its location and takes orders well late into the night with the last one being at 1:30 on weekends, I found something lacking in the place. First of all the seating on the back side on top floor was rather uncomfortable with short benches and big cushions. We ordered a some pisco drinks which were average, a whiskery sour which too wasn't super; the tom yam drinks were clearly passable (wonder why friends even opted for them). For food we got the meat platter and some truffle fries, the meat platter was extensive, but the fries were saltless and barely tasted of truffle. For pizzas we requested for one parma ham and another spicy salami; they didn't have the salami, we requested for any other pizza that they could spice up - no luck, so stuck with 2 parma hams. Funnily the cheese wasn't added to the base but only sprinkled on top. Didn't quite like the pizzas.The place can do really well, but need to change/improve their offerings. Jury still out on this one

Great place to have a nice dinner with friends or family. The rooftop bar serves pizza and bar-bites, while the restaurant on the 1st floor has much more on the menu. We had pizza (good selection of variations), which was really good! The atmosphere on the rooftop was very nice and the view at marina bay is a big plus!The menu has affordable prices (regular pizza for $18 and glass of wine for $10) for a fine restaurant like this

The outfit is located right on the Marina Bay front with a fantastic view on Marina Bay Sands from the roof top. I don't understand why you can only have pizza and not pasta when sitting on the roof top and the crew didn't have an answer either. Anyway, we had 3 pizzas and the humus and all of them were crispy and tasty - like in Italy. Drinks and food are reasonably priced, especially for the location. Happy hour is until 10pm
