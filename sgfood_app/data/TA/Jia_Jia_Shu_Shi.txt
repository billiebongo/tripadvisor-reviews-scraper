Have been coming here since I was a teen 15 years ago, for their delicious hawker fare. The stall only sells 2 dishes, 1) Fried Hokkien Mee, and 2) Char Kuay Teow. Both are extremely tasty, and each have a strong following. The Fried Hokkien Mee here is the variant with lots of bee hoon, very yummy
