There is a lot of food along this street, and this place, being close to my hotel, was buzzing and had a bit of atmosphere.
Service was attentive, food was good and the price fabulous

Not to many tourists, more Locals. Try the spicy crabs, buttered prawns and other delicious Seafood. The prices are ok considering the selection! We will return.

As a non-local we found this place via an online search for crab. Both times I've been it's quiet for the size of the place and Singapore, but as a seafood lover I can vouch particularly for the crab! Good chilli crab, but the black pepper is a standout and now my favourite (ps I Brought along a local seafood fan to check it wasn't just a non- Singaporean opinion)!Service is adequate- nothing particularly friendly but gets the job done.The quietness is actually one of the attractions for me- have had good nights with great food, chats and a pleasant breeze on the outside tables. The price has usually worked out a little cheaper than the chain seafood restaurants (eg jumbo, no signboard), and easy to get into.Will no doubt be back

This 3-in-1 establishment of Turtle House and Old Punggol is amazing. Went recently to have dinner for chinese new year. Lou hei was surprisingly yummy topped up with Caviar and abalone *.* Food was awesome - my personal favourite is the chilli crab and salted egg crab (best of both world, truly can't decide which is better). Those who like exotic food can try their famous Turtle soup, rich history of 40 years. Truly one of the best places that serves up good Chinese food. Even better then the popular Jumbo Seafood etc. *two thumbs up!

This restaurant serves very good and varied food. May be little expensive given the quality of the food, the ambiance and setting of the restaurant. Its crowded at night and paring may be a problem also. Parking is a problem any ware in Gaylang during evening anywa

We stayed as a family group of 5 people.We ordered around 7-8 dishes, some of them double, so not 8 different dishes.After a long waiting of 40 minutes, two of us get there little seafood dish. Without any rice or something.After finishing that and asking the staff after the other dishes it tooks 20 more minutes to get 2 more dishes.As we wanted to eat these together with a veggie dish we were waiting for and some rice, the meat becomed cold. So We asked 4 more times after the other dishes, that we could eat together.But it takes 30 minutes more to get these.We just ate it and payed.Other big groups, asian people, were served constantly with heaps of dishes.Maybe not a good place for tourists ;-

Was there for crab with my hubby.. Nothing much special.. Feels that the waiter there boast alot... We asked for female crab with eggs... the staff told us no worries.. female crab sure have eggs.. and if it is him who is choosing, guarantee there are eggs despite us telling him that we went a few seafood place but there are no eggs.. and he keep saying they will be.. indeed true, after he came back he told us, he killed few but there are no eggs... and say perhaps we could change 1 crab to a male crab.. so we changed.. had black pepper crab.. its not too bad but just didnt have the female egg.. i know subsequently he came back and told us.. now perhaps its not the season for crab.. so no eggs.. i and my hubby just cant be bothered anymore.. cause he is like talking nonsense.. one other thing is that.. we saw a "fish" on the floor (quite a distance away), yes lying on the floor. my hubby asked one of the waitress if thats a fish and the waitress was like "OMG" and she quickly run out to find the other make staff.. the male staff picked up the fish and throw back into the water tank.. later he came to us and tell us the fish is not dead yet.. he say when suppliers sent this fishes over, also in boxes, and does not contain water and they are like still alive... well.. seriously i dunno what to say abt this place but definitely wont consider to go back again.

Dined here over Christmas. Had the Chilly Mud Crab. It was excellent. The staff were very efficient and willing to help. The food was great. Would recommend this restaurant for anyone wanting an authentic Chinese Singaporean seafood experience.

We went there only for one thing: chilli crab. And the crab was everything we expected and then some. Delicious dinner. But quite expensive.

Lot of Chinese and Thai ladies "sporting houses" which is a lot of fun for a single male traveler. You may know that this activity is very legal in Singapore. The Orchard Street Mall offers great nightlife entertainment after 8:00 PM or so.

It is a bit pricey for what you get, but nice food for sure. They talked us into a fish (grouper maybe) which was way over priced. The crab covered in egg sauce was delicious though and made the entire experience worth while.

This restaurant is tremendous, crab in a variety of cuisines. The service is great and I would always return to eat here again and again and again!!!

at the central of singapore,everything seems to be just the opposite from geylang.it remains the same like for over 40 years ago.crowded with many chinese migrants.many food stalls and it taste original and not like the convenient food in some food court.it is very full during the weekends where you can hardly walk around.you can get something to eat whenever you are hungry because they are open 24 hours

During recent stop over our group of 6 ventured to Geylang for 4 hours to enjoy some of the great street eats on offer. After a few cold beers in the nearby hawker centres, the midday heat and humidity got the better of us and we went in search of somewhere air conditioned. We almost immediately stumbled on this place. The staff were very welcoming and we were promptly seated in the air conditioned glass enclosure. By 12.15 the place was packed. The beer was served ice cold in reasonably priced jugs. We were far from extravagant with our ordering indulging in omelettes and noodle dishes. All beautifully cooked and presented and very generous portions. Ultimately twice the price of what you would pay for beers and similar dishes in a Hawker centre but well worth it for the comfort and service

You have not lived until you try all types. I favour the chicken but try them all. A tasty dish that lets you live the experience. Be wary, a murtabak can be warm but ask and the lads will give you one not so spiced... well suited to Singapore coffee

One of the great things about Chili Crab Pungol is the fact that it tastes as good today as it did 30 years ago on the North Shore of Singapore, before moving to current location. I have been eating Pungol Chili crab for over thirty years. We used to go to North Shore with T shirts and shorts and a cloth bib -and we always brought a hammer to help break open the crab. There is no better crab than at Old Pungol North Shore even to this day
