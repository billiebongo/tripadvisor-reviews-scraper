Went with girl friend from overseas to this dessert place. Taste has changed. And their signature ginger juice with steam eggs no longer in the menu, really missed it
Black sesame paste still acceptable but the barley with egg drop is a disappointment.

Went to JI De Chi with my friends for late night dessert last weekend. Though it was packed, but we got seated very quickly. The service were quick, the quality of their Yuan Yang Paste was pretty consistent.

If you are around that area and want to have Chinese like dessert, you probably find a few choice. Ji De Chi is one of them. The desserts are standard, I always get mango sago and that is average.

Came here today for some dessert after lunch nearby. Opted for the mango sago with pomelo. It was ok but I think I prefer the nearby Ah Chew for quality. It somehow also seems slightly friendlier there too.

This is the Lui Hau Shan of Singapore offering my favorite Mango Sago with squishy tapioca balls, pomelo and ice cream. Other than the great mangoey dessert of my choice, it's a no-thrills place with no-thrills service and in peak hours you may even be asked to make space for new incoming customers if hanging around for too long

It has been a hot day outside today. Luckily those wonderful dessert cool me off after eating them. The double-skin milk with almond is so silky smooth and soft whereas the almond & black sesame paste is full of flavour. Sure to come back for more

Went to punggol waterway point outlet. Tried their black sesame paste and it was not too sweet, thick and smooth. Price at $3.30 each. This is more of a dessert shop so you can't find much snack option here except for some steamed yam & pumpkin cake. I only got to know that you can use handphone number to join as member to accumulate points. 50 points entitle you to $2 off

So we decided to check out Ji De Chi's desserts last night as some friends visiting from outside Singapore had a craving for durian and tang yuan.Having eaten at An Chew's last week, we have to say that we prefer the taste of the desserts at Ji De Chi. What we ate:1. Tang yuan in a spicy ginger soup served warm - you get 5 bouncy tang yuan - glutinous rice balls filled with either black sesame paste or crushed peanuts. The tang yuan dough was fairly thin and not too chewy as it should be. Nicely done.2. Durian and sago dessert served cold. You get creamed durian and sago pearls in a bowl with crushed ice. Delicious. 3. Beancurd skin soup with ginkgo nuts served cold. This is a milky soup made by boiling bean curd skin till it breaks down. The soup had just the right amount of sweetness and didn't taste of artificial flavours.Both the tang yuan and beancurd skin soup are traditional Chinese desserts while the durian one is a fairly new thing.Don't expect friendly and warm service when eating at the local dessert shops. The servers mainly want to seat you quickly and get you out quickly. The crowds mainly descend in the evenings after dinner so be prepared to wait if you arrive after 8 pm.If you are a Chinese dessert enthusiast or want to sample some very local desserts, we'd recommend Ji De Chj (which means 'remember to eat')

If not for the minimum word count, I would just say, "don't ever visit".The service was horrible and fixated. I wanted to order a longan beancurd for my mum but their version comes with mango. Unfortunately my mum could not take mango so I asked them if they could change the mango serving to longan. Without consideration, they rejected me outright and insisted I top up $2 for an additional portion of longan.Given their inflexibility, I decide not to persue further and ordered that dessert without mango.10 minutes later, the dessert was served with mango! That sums it all

On previous visits, we had tried Ah Chew and Dessert First, so we wanted to try the third shop on the street, Ji De Chi. We thought it was the best of the three. For warm desserts, Ah Chew is easily the best. But they lack in cold desserts. Dessert First gives a larger serving, but we found the consistency of the shaved ice was such that you knew it was, well, frozen water. The snow ice at Ji De Chi had a consistency more like ice cream than ice. In our group of four, one had the sesame, one had durian, one had chendol and I had the mango. Everyone loved their order. My mango had balls of passion fruit that gave the dish a nice pop.Service is adequate, if a bit rushed. But the orders came out correct and relatively quickly, so who could ask for more

The Durian snow ice was good. We always come here when we visit Singapore. It is not pricey. They blend the durian and pit in beside of the snow ice
4
This dessert shop has a mix of traditional desserts and the modern shaved ice as well. The prices are around $5 per dessert and the service is pretty fast and you can choose from a menu, as opposed to lining up to order it.

Yummy Hong Kong desserts which taste as authentic as the ones in Wan Chai itself. This is the only place where shaved ice desserts taste the best without being pretentious or too sweet!

Great dessert

Economical price, good variety of desserts. Love their tang yuan with ginger sauce... muz try
3
It was my first time to try these types of dessert and I loved it. I had a bowl of Water Chestnut with Herbal Jelly and it was refreshing, to say the least.
4
My first try at this dessert store, definitely will return for more. Ordered Chee cheong fun, mango glutinous rice roll, Yin Yang sesame almond paste and durian shaved ice, and free with a bowl of green bean soup as they are having promotion with $20 spent. All are nice.

Came here for dessert after lunch at a nearby restaurant on a Friday. There was no queue and only a few other people inside, so we were able to get served pretty quickly. I had the mango with sago, whilst my dining companion had a mango pudding. All tasted quite ok, and I would consider coming back for another visit
2
I spotted 3 dessert places along Liang Seah street and this was the least packed. The sesame ice shaving was disappointing as I cannot taste any sesame in the ice shaving. The taste depended heavily on the accompanying condiments such as nata de coco and red bean paste. The quality of the ice shaving, on the other hand, was very fine and well done. Overall a disappointing experience. It explained why it was the least packed compared to the other 2 competitors along the same street

There will usually be a long queue forming if you were to go on weekend nights. Be prepared to queue for about 15-30 minutes before you get seated! Recommendations on what to eat:1) Mango with Pomelo Sago (the POPULAR choice which doesn't go wrong)2) Durian Shaved Ice - SGD$6.00 (For the durian lovers, the durian taste is rather strong! )3) Green Tea Snow Ice (if you like MATCHA, then this is good)4) Black and White Sesame Paste (Hot sweet dessert) For more information and pictures, you may refer to my blog at: http://adriennehoxy.com/?p=65
