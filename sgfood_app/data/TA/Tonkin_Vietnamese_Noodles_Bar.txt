Take out food was fast. The whole place looks nice and homey. Just across the street where I am staying

After having passed by a few times, finally had a chance to come in with my sis and dad. Wasn't expecting much as there were only 3 customers there during a weekday lunch hour, but I just wanted to try it out.I arrived first and took a seat and was immediately brought a menu and ice cold water. I realized that there was only 1 staff in the restaurant doing everything from serving to cooking. Again, did not expect much.Ordered Combination Beef noodles set, Dry Beef noodle set and a Pork Ball noodle. They were all great! The broth was flavorful and the beef slices tender. The pork ball was a handmade and with a mix of mushroom. A bit of the small side but there was a good number in there. The Dry Beef noodles were a bit on the tasteless side, but a bit of additional sauce made up for it. Drinks a bit to sweet but mix with free flow water and it was perfect.I have to say though, the best thing there was the service. The single staff there was fast, efficient, attentive and entirely friendly to us and all other customers who came and went. I said I was staying behind to do some work on my laptop with their free wifi and he brought a new cup of water without me asking. He saw me moving to a smaller table to work and he automatically cleared it of all utensils and sauces, even though there was more than enough space for me to work with those there.The best service I have gotten since I was on an SQ flight over 10 years ago. I would highly recommend to go back just for this
