Frequent Kai Garden many times for dim sum and for dinner - each time Lai Garden delivers absolutely delicious food and the service is excellent!
4
My first time at Kai Garden yesterday. Was impressed. Their rendition of traditional dim sum was very interesting. Thoroughly enjoyed the Siew Mai, Har Gao and Xiao Loong Bao. The Char Siew was slightly disappointing but the lobster noodles were excellent. Service was prompt.
4
Read many good reviews so decided to have reunion dinner here. Really like the Peking duck something different from what I had before in other restaurants. It is a little pricey but the food quality is good! Service staff are also attentive and friendly
4
Food was really really good. We enjoyed everything we ordered. The siew mai is definitely a must-order. However, prices seem alil on the pricey side, even when compared to dim sum restaurants

Making reference to the response from The management of Kai Gardens written on 17 Dec 2017. I will like to correct the facts the management has responded. At point of arrival we have made known to the manager that we are a group of 6 adults and 1 child. Table arrangement was made and Food was ordered only after all 6+1 had been well settled and seated. The order was given by my brother who is in his mid 40ties and not my elderly Father who was wheelchair bounded and has vocal dysfunction due to his medical condition. Given there were 3 elderly whom are all above 70 years of age and 1 child out of the 6+1, the number of dishes recommended were definitely excessively resulting in wastage.The $1000 paid was secondary but the way an experienced Restaurant manager had managed the excessive order and the speed the food was served is indeed a big disappointment. Our dishes were individually plated and the dishes were served so quickly that each diner had 2 plates at some point in time which we felt that we were hurried off even though there were only another 3-4 tables that was occupied out of the whole Restaurant that night.I hope the Restaurant management can advise the staff to act in his professionalism as customers returned based on their experience.

Peking duck was good. Presentation was unique with wraps coming in various favours. Price was a bit steep though 88+ And 28 for cooking the duck. Service could be better as the waiter could have warned us against ordering too much.

6 adults. We ordered the Peking duck which is a day earlier. The Peking duck is $88++, as for the meat it is either we just eat it as it is, no charges. However we choose to use the duck meat to fry with yu fu noodle we have to pay additional of $28++(service charge),we also ordered baked egg plant(brinjal)$27++,poached cai xin w dried shrimps $30++,and chrysanthemum drinks $28.80. The total bills come up to $237.52. The Peking duck is the main course and highlight. It is delicious and yummy duck skin crispy and hot. The coloured Poh Pia skin is colourful that might puts u off but was told that the colour is from vegetable. The black is charcoal, the red is bee root, the yellow is from pumpkin. If eaten the different coloured Poh Pia skin do not have the veg taste . It just taste like the normal Poh Pia skin. Overall good will come agai

7 of us for dim sum lunch. Even my mum who is picky with food was satisfied. Reasonable pricing for its class. Excellent service. Will go again.
5
Attentive and highly responsive service. Food was as expectedly good and good recommendations on food choice.
2
Upon being seated and before we could even open the menu, the lady came over to us and started recommending different things for us to order. I felt it was very pushy and she went on saying how it was highly recommended and so on, continued standing there and insisted upon taking our orders immediately- after the meal when the bill came we discovered they charged us 96 alone for our 3 appetisers in addition to all the other ‘recommendations’ that we had. In all the other restaurants we have been to, the wait staff usually give a few recommendations off the menu and give us some time to decide before coming back to take our order. They stood there and expected us to order immediately and quickly. This made the entire experience extremely unpleasant.

My parents in law had a good dining experience previously and brought the family to try out the restaurant.While I agree the food is good, I was appalled by the condescending service by the managers. The male manager was impatient and rude in answering queries. What is wrong in answering queries your customers have?We had ordered coconut pudding for dessert but were presented with red ruby instead. When we requested for a change, the waiter kindly said it will be done. However the female manager then came back and demanded we take the red ruby and it is the same thing. Well whether it is the same or not, shouldn't you just change the orders instead of forcing your customers to have it? That really left a bad taste in our mouths. So yes, good food but atrocious service. I will not patronise ever again.

Brought my hubby, mil and two kids there for hubby's bday celebration. Were greeted by their warm services - my 6yo boy was given a shawl when he complained cold, they gave us complimentary longetivity buns and some dessert upon knowing that it was my hubby's bday which we didn't ask for. I was only checking if they sold bday cake. On the whole, we had a relax and cosy family dinner there
5
Amazing food and good service.I usually bring family and good friends here to try out their unique and delicious dishe
5
The service was great and provided good recommendations. The quality of food was high as well. We will definitely visit again!

Have been going to Kai Garden ever since a good friend brought us there. Superb food with consistently standard cooking. Quality is never compromised. Not just tantalising to the taste buds but food presentation is appealing to the eyes too. Service is another plus, the managers are knowledgeable and very professional with their service and always a pleasure to dine there. The service crew are always welcoming and made us feel like friends not just customers. The dim sum is one of the best we have tried in Singapore. Always consistent and always fresh ingredients
1
We had dinner for a group of 6 adults and 1 child and ended up paying more than $1000. Food is just satisfactory however we were very unhappy with the service and the professionalism of the restaurant manager. Instead of recommending the appropriate portion, the manager recommended portion equivalent to having 4 main courses and 2 side dishes for everyone including the child below 12. The dishes were served individually plated and at relatively fast pace which we could not enjoy. Guests that were not able to keep up had several dishes piled on their side of the table. Not only were we overstuffed, we ended up indigestible at the pace the food were served. We had to cancel the 7th dish. This will be the last time I will visit the Restaurant.

Food was good but on the expensive side. Paid $4xx for 4 people. Service was excellent! Will be back
4
We came here for dim sum lunch. They have set lunch promotion for 4 which includes a Peking duck cost only $98++ per table. Really worth it. Will come again next time for their set lunch promotion. 2 of us had prawn dumplings, Bbq honey pork buns, mushrooms dumpling with truffle oil, crispy Cheong fun, deep fried scallop with mango roll and a bowl of pig stomach soup with almond. The soup was really good but price was high. As for dessert, we had ice cream wrapped with chocolate which was okay. Instead I find that the aloe Vera with lime n sour plum is more refreshing. The dim sum tastes more superior than some Chinese restaurant and the food presentation is appealing to me. You won't go wrong for dim sum which are chef's recommendations.

3rd time back here, the peking duck is great. The xo carrot cake is a must try too ! Totally worth the price :
5
Prices abit on the higher than normal restaurant. they serve the best char siew pastry!!! Must try!!! Unique dishes.
5
A must to try the collagen filled Sharkin soup and braised chicken feet. The dim sum was awesome! Nice ambience..
4
Gret dining experience to satisfy my family’s dimsum cravings! Items are on the pricier side but quality was good. Only issue was with the desserts which were a little over priced and not really worth it for its pric
5
Consistent food quality and excellent service, always a pleasure to return and bring more friends there
5
This is my third visit to the restaurant, and I am always pleasantly amazed how they make traditional food different, either in terms of presentation, taste or both

I went for the executive set lunch which cost $98++ with my family. It's great that they gave the option of paying $24++ for an additional person. The peking duck wraps were unique as they had this crispy cracker that you can add with 5 different kind of sauces. The different coloured wraps made everything very fun too. However, we were rather disappointed with the noodles that were cooked with the left over duck meat. There were barely any duck meat in the noodles and the noodles were rather bland. So I guess that's why the lunch set was that cheap because more than 3/4 of the duck's meat was gone. Bear in mind that you get the the same size of duck whether there're 4 or 5 people. Also, the pot of tea cost $24 which I wished that the waiter informed us beforehand rather than giving us a shock when the bill came. But other than the noodles with duck meat, the rest of the dishes were nice! Especially the salted egg yolk fish skin!
4
Had the set dinner which goes for $50++ per person ($199++ for 4). The set dinner is worth the price considering it has abalone, lobster and shark fin. Taste wise is as good as any other fine restaurant as it is helmed by Chef Fung of Paradise Group. The ala carte menu is more expensive, so opt for set deals. Service can be better for sure.
5
Even it’s hidden at the back of the mall but the food is excellent. Service from the manager was also good. A bit pricy but worth every cents. Hope to be back soon.
4
good dim sum. lunch set looks promising. pity didnt get to try that. most dishes were good for the taste buds. the most ex lobster dumpling was not worth it in any way though. waiter was very pleasant
5
It was mid-autumn festive dinner with my family. My second visit and the dishes were were as good as my first visit. My family enjoyed the food very much. It was their first try. Satisfied dinner for all of us.
5
The food is very nice, quality is very good, service is excellent, although the price is higher than I expected.
5
Very delicate food and good attention to details. Special preparation and presentation of food. Definitely worth trying.

Heard good reviews of the dim sum at Kai Garden and finally got myself to try it with a couple of friends.The Xiao Long Bao and Siew Mai were pretty exquisitely presented and I must say they tasted good too. Likewise for the rest of the dishes we had.However, I must say that the service is not fantastic. I asked for iced - water and the waiter told me they don't serve and only have either still or sparkling water. My other friends later told me that they do serve iced water however. Regardless, I wasn't aware and the waiter did not tell me so either . Hence I asked for still water. However, the water kept getting refilled but I did not see any sign of the bottle of still water I had ordered.Later, the bill came with a $8 slapped on the still water purchased. We did not confront the restaurant and waiter as it was a happy occasion. However, I am certainly going to contact them to clarify on this mysteriously charged still water later on.Just beware .
5
Had dim sum for lunch. I would say one of the good dim sum place around Marina Square area, short of going for one in the pricey hotels nearby. Highly recommend.
4
As always, fresh ingredients and authentic taste creates a great dining experience especially with family
4
The food was decent but not the greatest. We spent over $200 ala carte for 2 of us when the set menu was $188++ for 4. Not certain it was worth the items I'd chosen. Should consider carefully if choosing ala carte
5
Peking duck was superb with crepes of different and Flavours. Beef stir fried with garlic was delicious as were the vegetarian mushrooms deep fried with pumpkin sauce. Roasted pork and honey BBQ pork were both good but the portions are smallish.
3
I tried their set lunch before, it was pretty good. But 2nd time, I go for their Tim Sum lunch as many were ordering.The dishes, to be honest, or pretty unique, and some which you may not find in other places.However, the quality of food taste is not there.Price is decent, most come in 3pcs, but it does not have the authentic TimSum taste that you would expect.Maybe it is difference taste bud.Very crowded on Sundays, so service will be lagging, but overall a place you can go for family meals
5
The food there are great! Had the best salted egg fish skin up to date. The service there are really great to
4
Service was good and food was served promptly. Great atmosphere for a get together session with friends. Pricing was a tad expensive but still value for money
4
First time here and was delighted by the quality of the dim sum which was reasonably priced. Would definitely return
4
A pleasant ambience, attentive service, treasures from the kitchen. Amazing.We had half-a-chicken. Perfectly roasted and seasoned. Yummy. The luscious scallops were well harmonised with crunchy, tender, asparagus tips. Shiok. The Sweet 'n Sour Pork On The Rocks - came skewered and planted atop a bed of ice. A crazy mix of taste, feel, texture and colour... with red and green capsicums to boot. Sedap.The Prawn dish came - crunchy, pumped up, plump 'n juicy in a unique paste. Unbelievable.The Claypot Veal did not disappoint. The super soft tofu, enveloped in crispy cube exterior was sheer ecstacy. Mindboggling.Crispy Noodle with Crab Legs - a bit of a letdown as the sauce came insufficient and rather bland. Sad. But for this item, my overall rating would have been Excellent.Coconut dessert in a chilled goblet was a hit. Out of this world.All said... a great dinning experience.Fantastic. Blurp
5
What an excellent restaurant with great food, every dish is prefect and tasty.We had a business meeting and there were the signature shark fin soup in earthenware, tender pork ribs with cartilage, wagyu beef etc. We enjoyed every dish that was cooked, presented perfectly. Will come again
4
The must order dish is their Peking Duck. The skin is crispy and the meat tender. What is unique is their multi color skin wraps plus the various sauces to go with the dish. The meat of the duck mixed with fried noodles is yummy.Service by staff was good. The restaurant serves Tim Sum as well as other Cantonese dishes. Prices are slightly higher compared to other similar style restaurants
5
A friend brought me to Kai Garden and I was wowed by how the dishes taste. I took my family there again next week and was wowed by the consistent good standard of the food served. Super like! You have to try their Peking Duck.
5
Tips: 1. Book a table before you go2. Order the usual har gao (thinnest skin and heaps prawn filling) and siew mai (served in quaint 'basket'). Their innovative dishes were xiao long bao (served in sharks' soup), durian pastry (charcoal bun), cheong fun with fried mushroom as fillings. For 4 people and 2 dozen dishes, we each paid sgd36. Immaculate service and high quality food, so yummy that my man-in-the-house declared, "This dim sum is even better than in Hong Kong!
5
Good taste great n excellent service. Plates were changed regular. Choices of good variety is Wide to
3
Would have given this a 4-star rating if not for 2 issues:- the cost of normal tea for 4 was over $11- server had no skill in carving the peking duck. Duck skin was served with a lot of fat. Had the peking duck twice, same issue both occasions. Saving grace was that the food was actually really good
5
Great Dim Sum, quite different from the normal stuff. The XO carrot cake, xiang long bao, crispy cheong fun, charcoal bun & char siew so & crab noodles are excellent! Surprisingly cheap for the quality.
4
Cozy dinner with 2 other friends. Menu pretty extensive and prices are pretty reasonable considering the quality of food. My meal is not complete without ordering my fave dessert, chilled coconut puree! It's heavenly
4
We ordered the executive set lunch, overall the foods are nice. But the service staffs need to be more attentive because tea was not filled up and empty plates not removed from table. During the peak time the staffs are very busy serving the foods and forgotten the basic service
5
Very satisfied with the food quality, adequate food portion and superb service - good recommendation of dishes!

We came Kai garden restaurant on 1 July 2017, Sat and we have a VIP room. Food was fantastic, every dish come with its special signature way. Was three birthday girls celebration, our first time to visit here. We customized our menu. Was greatly hearty meal. The restaurant manager, Yoyo and her team came to sing birthday song to my girlfriends and also we had a beautiful lotus tree with hand-made lotus mini buns. Was a lovely pleasant moments to us. Very thoughtful of them. Kudos to her and her team We had spread of interesting appetizer, shark fin soup, Peking ducks with five different sauces such as wasabi, sweet and sour, seafood, original, black peppers. All were nice. Wraps also came with different types too. They took the duck meats to make another dish with golden mushroom, sweet and sour ball coated with wrap and presented with a bowl of ice, rice was cooked with truffle oil and big slice of abalone and interesting dessert.
3
Went for lunch with my two sons. Saw a review in Year 2016 that the food was superb. Quite disappointed, tried the Double Boiled Lobster soup - not fantastic; just normal. Was told that they are not serving their Signature Steamed Custard Bun that was recommended previously. The "siew mai" serving was unique. The price is a bit too high.But their service provided by the waiters and waitress were excellent. Thumbs UP
4
Last night in Singapore for this visit and came across KG.Food choice, presentation and quality excellent and came away with their card as will book as first night on our next visi
4
Service is very good and good too. Just the price a bit too high. Overall still very good especially the peikin duck
4
We came for the Executive Set Lunch for 4 pax @$98++ The highlight of this set lunch was the Beijing duck apart from the other dishes that were included. We had a whole Beijing duck accompanied by 5 different types of sauces (including original, black pepper, seafood, apple favours) and also 5 different types of wraps. Each type of wrap and sauce offered different taste experience. The cracker that also come with the wrap makes it a delicious combination. I have not eaten a Beijing duck served with different types of sauce and wrap. Big thumb for the Beijing duck
4
We celebrated Father's Day early this year and it was a weekend. Crowded and the team decided that they would fit us in a private room instead. Our server was very detailed and provided us with recommendations and was quick to changed our dirty plates to Ensure we have a pleasant meal. Food was good albeit a bit too salty for our palette but refreshing and different!
3
In Singapore, where the f&b scene is highly competitive... there are plenty of such "high" end chinese diners. Kai Garden is one of them, excellent service, great food. But somehow it doesnt have any shout-out. They're trying very hard to differentiate themselves, but the colourful "skin" and wide range of sauce for the peking duck seems "trying too hard". The Ko Lo Yuk on ice, felt funny. On the whole, i dont get any Wok-Hei, nor am i impressed with KG's food. It's OK, not awesome. Service did not fall short of expectation too
5
Was there with my family for dinner. Great service was delivered by the team. We had a few young waiters serving us, however they were professional. When my mom did not understand English, a Chinese speaking waitress came to assist. It was a joy having dinner there! ◡̈
1
Visited the restaurant with 3 adults & 2 children. We ordered tea. Waiter poured the tea into 5 cups without even asking if the children want tea. One of the cups was dirty so I told waiter to take it away & I won't need a replacement since we only have 3 adults. Does young children drink tea in the first place?! We were later charged $24 for 5 cups of tea. I told the staff we didn't order 5 cups. We only have 3 adults. Children don't drink tea. The staff counted the cups on the table & said, "I will charge you for 4 cups of tea then." Obviously she saw that 1 cup of tea in front of my child was untouched. We only have 3 adults & she still charged us $19+ for 4 cups of tea? It's a rip off! This will be my 6th, & last visit to Kai Garden. I do not mind paying for the tea, but shouldn't the staff let us know they charge tea by number of cups, not by a pot, & ask if our young children drink tea?!
4
When we arrived at the main entrance there wasn't any one there. We managed to get a waitress attention to inform him that we've reserved a seat. After a while, the staff I believe must be the senior serving staff came to direct us to our table. We got a window seat table but the resetaurant was a bit noisy. Service and food were great. Dim sum menu was pretty much quite standard with the usual item lke har kau & siew mai. Were surprised to see shark's fin soup on their a-la-carte menu. We order two serving of different shak's fin soup and it was quite tasty. Will definitely recommend this restaurant
5
The dishes offered are really unusual and with a twist. The Peking duck is one such example. I normally don't like Peking duck that much but the 5 different sauces + the special biscuits + the different - coloured wraps (pumpkin, charcoal, spinach, original..) + the crispy skin of the duck made the wrap so delicious to eat. Another favourite of mine is the sweet and sour pork which was served on a bed of ice. When you bite on the pork, you will hear a crunch as the outer part of the pork had caramelised further when dipped into the ice. As you bite further into the meat, the texture of the meat is cooked just nice and still remains very hot despite being dipped in a bed of ice! Yummm.. these are but just 2 dishes out of a number of other dishes not mentioned here. Don't just read about it. Go and try now
5
Food was great and staff attentive. They introduced each dish that was served. Hot towesl given before the meal. Had the Peking Duck which was the chef's speciality. Crispy skin and accompanied with 5 different sauces and wraps. My mum's birthday cake was also nicely presented
5
Was introduced to this restaurant by my Friend and have I have subsequently introduced another two group of friends there. Good service, wonderful view, well-executed food with a twist
4
Was there with my family to celebrate mothers day and the dishes were all above average. The Peking duck (whilst a tad bit expensive) was very finely prepared. Will consider revisiting.
4
Friend introduce this outlet to us, the timsum is quite creative to attrack crowd and the taste is good.But is a bit of pricey, it will be good if they have some promotion with credit card company than more reason for us to patronize.The manager, general manager, staff are all very accommodative that's a plus point in restaurants service. Good job
5
We have lunch here and surprisingly it's taste like authentic CANTONESE cuisine from Hong Kong. Ordered 10 kinds of dim sum and I promise you it's like eating in Hong Kong. The Peking duck is curved at your side table. Service is very good
5
Foods are good, service is good too. Two thumbs up. Very reasonably priced as Chinese fine dining. Must visi
5
Food was excellent , one of the best dim sum that I've tried. My favorites were Peking duck, Siu mai, carrot cake. Will be back again
4
+ Good service, quality food for the price. Peking duck is served with different sauces and different flavored pancakes, which is unusual.- Restaurant seems short handed so service may be slow at times
4
We were there for my husband birthday dinner. Arrived closed to 7pm and restaurant was quite quite. Ordered a set dinner and 2 more items from menu to share. Food was ok and service is good.
1
Ordered Peking duck and have requested to reserve the drumstick with skin to be served to my son. While the Waitress was serving the Peking duck, reminded them for the 2nd time. Was told that they can't do it on the spot and require kitchen to do it. Noted. My poor son was patiently waiting. Requested for the 3rd time and was told on it way. While serving the 2nd last dish, I asked again angrily. Was told they will check. Last dish served and requested to speak to the manager. Forgotten & missed out! Requested the long waiting duck to be taken away since already pass my son bedtime. To my surprise, they packed someone leftover duck as the duck skin was missing. Was informed by the manager this is the best they could do. Sigh! no sense apologies and worse gave us a super bad attitude. Anyway the food there nothing impressive. You can get similar quality or even better at normal foodcourt. Is our first and last visit. Please think twice before trying.
4
The food was not the normal dim sum items that one can find in a normal Chinese restaurant. Its dim sum with a twist and the food was really good. Excellent service by the server that was assigned to our table. She was very helpful and gave many recommendations on the restaurant's specialties.
5
So this is my first time at Kai Garden celebrating my grandfather's 70th birthday. The service staff was very engaging, friendly and very efficient. She even fed my younger brother who didnt want to eat! The food wise was excellent, we can tell that the chef are very professional, very dish was thought out meticulously. I will definitely recommend this place to others
4
nice restaurant abit pricey. their peking duck is interesting with different veg wrap such as beetroot, spinach and charcoal. Comes with 5 different sauces and a cracker to go with each wrap. the cracker adds a crunchiness to it. they only have whole duck at $88. their fried carrot cake in xo sauce is very good, usualky served during dim sum but they may hv it for dinner time, you have to ask for it. their other dishes are quite nice too. overall 6 dishes including the duck costs us ard S$250 for 5 pa
5
A routine Sunday lunch with family but this one really caught my attention. Its not your usual dim sum place and this joint serves great food. Quality is above average but pricey.Highly recommend but be sure to book in advance
3
Still one of our favorites restaurants for Peking Duck with the usual good and attentive service. However the food is less tasty this time
5
Was at Kai Garden for my mum's birthday lunch and we all had a great time! The food was delicious and the service crew are very attentive
5
Awesome Dim sum with a twist! We tried the Xiao Long Bao, Honey Char Siew and Chicken Feet with Abalone Sauce. However the dish -Fried Fish with truffle sauce is a little too ex - $126
4
This is very close to the Mandarin Oriental hotel in the mall. We don't normally go for Chinese food, but our meal was superb. We had a platter of Peking duck, pomelo salad and lobster in satay sauce, followed by crispy wasabi prawns which was just out of this world. Absolutely 5 star food. The staff were very efficient though a bit brusque with service, hence 4 stars
4
It was a pleasant surprise to have the staff singing the CNY Lohei instead of the usual phrases. Food was good though portion is small.
4
My family came here for lunch yesterday. The restaurant is on the the third floor of the very busy Marina Square and parking was a bit of a nightmare.We had roast pork to start, followed by various dim sim items, served in the most unusual and creative manner. We also had a most unusual item - a parcel of tofu skin and filled with mushroom, prawns, chicken, etc. Also we had xiao loong pau which was served in individual cute dishes, each bathed in some soup. It was delicious.We than had a Peking duck which was excellent, served in different pastry wrappers made from spinach, pumpkin, beet root and the original white ones. We had a choice of at least four sauces, supposedly created by their own chefs. The waiting staff was very courteous and made a show of explaining each sauce to us and recommended which one was most appropriate. The second duck dish was stirred fried and came served on a bed of fried rice noodles in lettuce cups. Our last dish was angel hair pasta cooked in scallop. However I didn't taste that as I was already too full.Top marks to Kai Garden especially for creativity and presentation
5
Codfish, dragon prawn broth are my favourites here. Service is excellent. A safe choice if you want good quality food. Price is on the high side. Expect to pay about $150+ for a family of 4
2
Overall is poorFood is not value for money, actually on the high side but service and atmosphere is quite goo
3
Food so so as Chinese restaurant , but the service and atmosphere is good. Overall quite enjoy . May look into their Tim Sum
5
We had a very enjoyable meal at Kai Garden. Sherry made very good recommendations and services was good but not intrusive. This is one of our favorite Chinese restaurant
4
The restaurant is Spacious and bright. Good food, presentation and service but the price is slightly high for dim sum
3
This restaurant has been highly recommended for it's Dim Sum dishes. Unfortunately, these are only available for lunch, but I came in the evening.So, I was initially a bit disappointed as I love Dim Sum. But that didn't last for very long. The staff recommended a couple of dishes to me from the menu.I was served some delicious bork belly bits, aubergine and fried rice. All relatively simple dishes but the quality was mind blowing. Service is efficient, the decor not very inviting and a bit sterile. Prices rather high but ok.I really enjoyed this place
4
Food was good. Service was not bad given that it was full that night. Plc a tad noisy and we had to shout to make ourselves heard! But I guess it was more due to the festive mood of cny
5
It was our first and definitely more visits to dine at Kai in the future. Although it was during the Lunar New Year, the set menu was well set out, dishes were flavorful and the service was excellent inspite of the new year dining crowd.Will return to try the main menu
4
Definitely must try the signature peking duck is really delicious, rich crispy skin and the succulent duck meat.
5
Top grade ingredients treated with the utmost care.Attentive staff.A bit on the high side on pricing but worth every cent
5
The restaurant is well ran and service is above average of the classic Sunday dim sum place in Singapore. Food is good quality, and environment is rather pleasant. Recommend
4
Food was great, staffs were very courteous. However I give it a 4/5 because the waitress that took our order tried too hard to sell some of their more expensive items and kept urging us to order more dishes even though we have already ordered plenty. Overall it was still a very pleasant meal. Their beef dishes are amazing
5
Service is good. Food is superb. Price is on the higher side. However it's worth it. Ideal for family gatherings. They have private room as well so you can meet for business dinner too. Will go back agsin
5
This is our 2nd visit for our early CNY reunion lunch with the family. The quality was good and well presented, especially the popular Peking Duck which is still good like the first time we had.The service rendered by the staff, especially Christine Xu were forthcoming and warm. It is indeed a joy to be served by them and make our dining experience a pleasant one
5
The quality of food is exquisite and well thought. The junior staff may need more training but the senior ones provides impeccable service
4
Came here on a Sunday with family (6 adults, 2 infants), but was kinda disappointed that we could not get a private room. The air-con was kinda chilly, so do consider wearing something warm.The food was surprisingly good! We had a few of their signature dishes; like their Peking duck (which comes with 6 different kinds of sauces), dim sum and soup.Service was acceptable, considering the restaurant was full when we were there. The staff serving us was polite, and very apologetic whenever he made any minor service lapses.Overall we had a very satisfying lunch at Kai Gardens, and will definitely consider coming back agai
3
Invited by friends to this restaurant as they moved from another location and heard the chef was innovative in his food prep. So went to try the Cantonese food. Agree the food was prepared and presented differently. The Peking duck had different types of sauces in different color jars and one was the chef's speciality. The other dishes were also differently "fussioned" which gave them a twist as far as expectation was concerned. Overall the food was average but presentation was very good. Service level was tried very hard by the staff to be pleasant and accommodating. Lack some warmth here. Ambience is ok and as restaurant is new atmosphere was pleasant. Location of restaurant was a little challenging though.
5
Great service, cozy ambience, excellent food! Their signature Peking duck with Chef specialty sauce is a must try
5
We came here as our friend recommended this restaurant and booked online. We ordered the Peking duck which came with a variety of sauces, most were very good. It also came with rice crackers which really enhanced the overall texture and experience. We also had some other dishes such as onion chicken and taufu vegetable. Service was excellent and overall highly recommended
5
It was my first time here with my family, the Dim sum were exquisite & tasty. The food came in very nice presentation which impressed us and the kids

Kai Garden is a frequent haunt for myself since my first visit in March this year, with various groups of people. The last visit, however, left me disappointed. I really like this place and will want to visit it again soon, but while clearing the photos in my phone and recalling the incident, it makes my blood boil and I do hope that the management sees this. Once again, I must emphasize that I love the food and that all other staff members are not like him. I was served by a man, presumably in his forties (shall not name him though I know his name) and well-suited, when I brought my parents there for a simple dim sum fix one day late September. We entered the restaurant around 12.05pm (note the time). We took a while to decide and asked to place our orders around 12.15pm. The man served us and decided to speak to us in English although he couldn't really speak well. My mother decided to order in Mandarin for his convenience and the man instantly took offence. He insisted in taking the order in English, which we were fine with. However, his attitude and service changed greatly after that and he hurried my mother rudely when she decided to change an order. Soon after that, he came back to inform us that we are eligible for the complimentary early-bird marinated yam duck promotion. At that point, I was suspicious as I had just visited the restaurant a while back and I wasn't offered the promotion. I looked at the brochure and informed my mother that the man must have made a mistake. At that point, we asked the same man to come over to clarify on the promotion and he looked really smug then. He informed us that we will have to finish our meal by 12.30pm for the complimentary duck. We were shocked as it was already 12.19pm then and our orders were just placed. Then I asked the man if we would be charged and he said that we will be if we do not leave by that time. He was definitely making things difficult for us, and we had to explicitly mentioned that we do not want the "complimentary" duck at the end of our unpleasant conversation. He simply rolled his eyes and walked away. The food came soon after and they were well done as usual, but the unpleasant experience with the male service staff, presumably a senior manager, left a sour taste in our mouths. Upon further reading of the terms and conditions of the promotion, we were not even eligible for the promotion in the first place. Why would he even offer it? Was it to make us incur extra charges if we were careless or unfortunate enough? Or was it an attempt to get back at us for what he presume to be an insult of his command of English? Even if it were the latter, he should do some self-reflection and upgrading, rather than blame the world for his lousy English and bruised ego.I have stopped visiting the restaurant ever since, not that it will affect their business as the food is good, but I hope to visit again, with colleagues, friends and relatives. If I were to be served by this man again, I will make the extra effort to leave immediately and patronize the neighbouring restaurants

A new twist to eat peking duck. It is served with 5 different sauces, sesame, black pepper, seafood, chef special, and regular sauce. Dimsum is just so-so.
5
It's on the pricy side, but the restaurant didn't put a foot wrong with the food all evening. Flower crab salad in sesame dressing was fresh and delicate. Peking duck was a little gimmicky with the colored crepes and five different sauces, but at least it put a different spin on a traditional favorite. The duck was later used to wrap enoki mushrooms and cooked in black pepper sauce. The sweet and sour pork on the rocks was particularly innovative.
4
Quality of food is good. Service is prompt and adequate. Nice and conducive place to gather with family & friends for a meal.
5
So we came here with a group of friends and everyone was raving about it. They gave us a private room with no minimum spend. The peking duck was imaginative with 6 different sauces and very different flavor skin - unfortunately I only got one. The quality of the dim sum was very good. Unfortunately we just ate and ate
5
We make regular visit to Kai Gardens and the order of the signature dish Peking Duck is a must although it costs more than compared to other restaurants. I guess it's due to the serving of several choice of the exclusive sauce and wra

Food was excellent! Atmosphere and service was great! Would recommend to others who wants a special, exclusive (and of course more expensive) experience. :

Had dinner with my family on a Saturday night. Ordered the hairy crab set dinner at my mum's request. First 2 dishes - the Crispy Bun with hairy crab roe and chicken broth was ok, thougha little salty for me. When it came to the steamed hairy crab, the restaurant offered to replace one of the crabs as there were no roe inside. That was a welcomed gesture, though it meant having to wait another 15mins while they prepared it.The last dish was poached vermicelli with xiao long bao. One of my family members got one where the xiao long bao was cold on the inside. Restaurant offered to replace the dish, but we declined since it was a big deal for us.All in all, the dining experience was great due to the attentive staff.

I visited Kai Garden when they had their Shanghai hairy crab promotion. For S$88++ you get 6 dishes:Hairy crab roe with crispy bunDouble boiled hairy crab roe with chicken broth (my favourite dish in this set menu)Steamed whole hairy crab (210g male crab)Wok fried vegetable shoots with dried fish maw toppingsVermicelli with hairy crab roe xiao longbaoDessert of chilled red wine & roselle puddingFood was pretty good and well executed. Good value given it's hairy crab - an expensive delicacy. This is available for the month of November (hairy crab season).Service could have been more attentive and pacing of the meal was rather hurried.Wine list was overpriced and unlike other Chinese restaurant which generally waives corkage charges, Kai Garden insists on charging corkage at $15-30/bottle.The restaurant has a beautiful view of Marina Bay.Tip: ask for the seats near the windows
4
Quality like Paradise group better restaurants because of cook/owner.Fish was not best and was readily admitted by captain, blaming supplier.Pricey but can try for own experienc
5
The foods were very good, we orders 4 dishes, roasted pork, mixed veg claypot, toufu with mushroom, and sweet and sour pork. The latter was very unique, the pork was sit on the ice, making the pork very tender. The roast pork platter contained char siew and roast pork, both were tasty, just that the portion seemed small for the price. Both the toufu and the veg claypot were good. The most impressive was the service staff who keep attending to us, such as refilling the tea, changing plates, chatting with us, very friendly and attentive. Overall, we had a excellent meal at Kai Garden, the environment is good and the food did not disappoint us. May be the only negative thing was that the pricing of the foods was on the high side. We spent around $136 for the meal. However, this will no stop us from visit again as the foods were good and the service is excellent. Another thing, they gave us a $20 voucher valid for 3 months for the return visit.

Went for dim sum. Was surprisingly good. Recommend this restaurant for a nice Sunday brunch with the family. Bit hard to find in the sprawling mass of Marina sq
4
Good food! Exquisitely presented. Most impressed with its fine cutlery. In general, good service but unfortunately inconsistent
4
The Peking duck skin was beautifully wrapped with colourful and tasty crepe of different flavours. The various sauces in colourful bowls were unique and tasty. We had a great dinning experience
5
Knowing that the restaurant is opened by renowned Chef Fung, we already set a certain expectation to the food we are going to taste. Luckily the dishes did not fail our fussy palette. The appetizer, preserved Sichuan vegetable is not salty and the seasoning of spiciness and sourness is just nice. We order quite a few dim sum dishes include chicken's feet in abalone sauce, siew mai, lobster soup dumpling, carrot cake, deep fried egg plant with pork floss etc. My elders enjoyed the food as they are all well-balanced and delicious.Kai's service is also top-notched, the service crew are very attentive and after every dish they will replace the plate so that the sauce/flavor do not mix onto the next dish. Not only so, they will ensure that the tea is hot and keep refilling our cups and even serve warm towels to wipe our hands before the food is served.As is my mum's birthday, the whole lunch crew brought in the cake and gather around to sing birthday song for my mum. Overall, my family had an enjoyable lunch and definitely the food is worth re-visiting

Good service and outstanding food! My family and i enjoyed our birthday celebration for our darling daughter very much. Kids loved the food too and we will come back for sure

Kai Garden is a fairly new addition to the Singapore fine dining scene, offering upmarket Chinese dishes with a modern twist.We started with a small plate of goose liver pate that had been shaped into balls and glazed to look like cherries.We had the Three Barbecue Selection, which consisted of barbecued sliced duck breast, crispy barbecue pork, and barbecue pork in icy sauce.Other highlights were a hot pot of goose webs in vermicelli, duck tongue with asparagus, crispy fish skin with salted duck egg, and Chinese spinach with salted fish.For desert we shared a coconut with water chestnuts and a mango and pomelo purÃ©e.With two beers and a fruit drink the bill for three was S$298.Service was highly professional
5
My mum made me write this. Cos she was so happy with the quality of the food and service by the server, Candy. Twice we have been here; and we always walk away, heavier in the belly, in gastronomical heaven. Tried new dishes - home-made dace with black bean sauce and pickled fruit (yummy!), egg tarts (my picky sister asked for seconds), and spicy carrot cake. Tried boston lobster noodles for the second time - it is just as delicious and consistent in taste as the first time. The service is top notch - ask for Candy to recommend cos she nails the best dishes for us to try
5
The staff had set aside a duck as per my Chope request. Peking duck skin was crisp and not too fatty. Crepe skins were thin and colourful. Sauces were all delicious although my favourite is still the traditional sauce. Attentive staff and service. Lovely view of the Bay from the table by the windows

very quiet ambience, very high standard of cleanliness.Very well done, food design and dÃ©cor is very awesome! I will go back again for their dim su

I have been wanting to try the Peking Duck in this restaurant. I must admit that they are quite innovative with the "WRAPS". They are colorful, very thin and do not have too much "Floury" taste which I hated.On the whole, the Peking Duck was satisfactory, but the Skin could be more succulent and delicate (that will "Melt" in your mouth).The Flower Crab Salad was very Refreshing and Appetising.. The Chef's recommendation Shark Fin Soup was a "Bowlful of Collagen"..This Restaurant is definitely worth another Visit

With its creative take on Chinese cuisine, this new kid on the block has won over quite a following. With a nice modern decor and private rooms for functions, it can be challenging to get a table without a reservation during festive seasons and over weekends. Food is reasonably priced and service is excellent
4
Located at Marina Square ( next to Marina Mandarin Hotel ) on 3rd floor. Serves Chinese Cantonese food. Has vegetarian options as well. Had a local with us during the dinner and hence was able to convey our requirements very well. Service was good. Seating too was well laid out and is spacious. Is a very good place for special occasions, business lunch or casual dining
4
Located at Marina Square ( next to Marina Mandarin Hotel ) on 3rd floor. This cantonese restaurant serve excellent food. Try the beijing duck. Their speciality lies in their many different sauce and the special skin wrap with different taste. The abalone was also very good. Also order the fried skin fish with egg yolk. And we close it with mooncake durian as dessert. Heard the chef is from Taste Paradise chain ( one of the most popular chinese chain restaurant in singapore). They also serve dim sum in the morning and afternoon. As the restaurant is located inside shopping mall, it is very convenient for the whole family. Easy access by MRT too
4
If you want excellent dim sum Kai Garden is the place to have it.Note that its a posh restaurant and the staff are a little over attentive but the food makes up for this.Prices are more expensive that Din Tai Fung but the quality is also much better.We had a window seat over looking Marina Bay so a great spot.Note to management though..please clean the dust off the venetian blinds

We were guests at this nice and tastefully decorated restaurant, for a quick and light business lunch. We were very impressed by the food presentation, and the quality. Although we didn't see the menu nor the prices, I am sure it is pretty expensive given the location. We were served a fish herbal soup, sweet and sour pork meatballs with a twist, siew mai, chee cheong fun, wagyu beef steak and truffle angel hair pasta with shrimps (fresh water prawns). The siew mai and chee cheong fun were nothing special but the rest were very good. The meat balls had coconut cream in the middle, and was served on a bed of crushed ice, and yet, the outside was very crispy while the inside was very hot. You have to be very careful not to burn your tongue on your first bite, but it was very good and done well. The siew mai was prettily presented in a flat basket, the wagyu beef of course was delicious (I have yet to eat wagyu that isn't!) and my husband just raved about the truffle pasta/noodles. It was very fragrant and el dente and the taste was delicious! Service was good and the food was served promptly once the restaurant was informed that we had a short time for lunch. I do recommend this place and would like to return there again for dinner to try the dishes
4
Thought it was unique to have colourful wraps and a variety of sauces to go with the duck. The crispy skin was not too greasy and the accompanying corn crackers were good enough to eat on its own with the chilli. For the 2nd preparation, the chunks of meat was fried with brinjal in a tomato-based sauce. We packed the remainder back (ordered too much!) and it was still yummy the next day! The staff was very attentive and friendly too
4
Craving for dim sum was satisfied in this nice chinese restaurant. Service was brilliant and the food served were delicious. The standard Har Gow and Siew Mai dishes met expectations. Worth a return visit definitely.
4
This is the 3rd times I visited kai garden. Overall is quite a good and friendly restaurant. Food is good. Only things is for couples visit some food is too much. I don't mind the price.
3
The food was just average and very fanciful. They were a little too high handed with the salt and the food was nothing to shout about
3
Good place to book last minute as it's never full, but wait staff were very pushy in insisting on their recommendations
5
We visited Kai Garden on my birthday, and ordered a Peking duck for 2. The duck was juicy, skin was crispy, and the variety of sources and wraps were fascinating. We like the creativity from the chef to add in more dimensions to the already fabulous food. At the end of the meal, I had a surprise cake from the staff with all of those singing Happy Birthday song. It's a wonderful experience. Thank you Kai Garden to make my day. Will definitely come here again for big occasions, and introduce it to my friends
5
Brought my friend there to celebrate and catch up. Ordered the carrot cake, custard buns, truffle noodle and signature Siew Mai in a mini bamboo carrier. Resto manager recommended abalone sauce chicken feet, great choice. Service is consistently great , which is rare to find in Singapore for busy restaurant
4
Went specially for the Peking Duck which boasted of rice crispies, flavored skin and an assortment of 5 sauces, hoi sin sauce, chef sauce, goma sauce, black pepper and a crab seafood paste. I did a combo of all sauces and a mix and match, it was nice but Peking Duck is never one without the hoisin sweet sauce, which is a must in every combo. The cherry foiegras is unique good and good to try at least once. I would however simply just order the duck and request for them to slice up the meats for more peking duck feasting cos the meat cooked in e fu noodles wasnt to my standard and tasted bland.The ambience is good with private rooms sitting up to 50pax and a 18pax table. I enjoyed the duck especially and the wonderful and sincere service presented by the staff.Reservations much encouraged
4
Kai Garden serves excellent dim sum. One of the best dim sum restaurant I've been. Service is very good too. I will definitely recommend to my family and friends
4
We ordered from the Ala Carte menu and I will order the following in my next visit : braised fish maw; scallops with asparagus and egg white; double-boiled soup; braised goose feet; charcoal bun; dice fish in porridge. The rest of the dishes are respectable and well-executed but in such a competitive F&B environment like Singapore, I'd rather be excited. The only thing was the restaurant is really short-handed and we had cases of totally dirty/gravy-filled plates and empty teapots waiting to be refilled. Of course, once you get their attention, it gets attended to immediately.
4
Celebrated several June birthdays over dinner here. Was given a private room overlooking the Marina Bay. We had the Peking Duck, fish head soup, char Siew Pork ribs, sweet and sour pork on ice, mee Sua on superior stock and steam egg. We had corkage waived and the waitress have good service and provided good explanations to the menu.
4
Being a cantonese, nust agree that they served an amount variety of food. Though the price was leaning against the steeper side, food was good and awesome friendly service they have there!
5
The dishes we ordered were prepared uniquely, eg Peking Duck with the different types of wrap, jelly fish (sounds common but trust me it is different) prepared with Thai sauce, black fungus with vinegar, charcoal pork bun. For desserts, we ordered red ruby in coconut and almond cream. The latter is not in the menu but the Chef prepared fresh. As there were only four of us - my mum and sisters, we hope that the restaurant can consider half duck order instead of a full duck as we were just too full to order other signature dishes. However, we will be back there again to try the other dishes but minus the peking duck. The service staff are very well trained with excellent manners and are able to recommend and explain the various dishes
3
We came here many times for the best Peking duck in town. But now the stopped selling half a duck. A full duck is too much for 2 and doesn't allow for ordering other dishes to have a variety. We gave them feedback but their only reply was that this is the new policy and that they tried long time and the half duck is not nice. Unbelievable comment - they considered the dish we returned for many times as not good, I should ask for my money back! They seemed to be reluctant to inform their management about our feedback. So here it is out in the public..
5
Had lunch with my family at Kai Garden and it was fantastic! Loved the charcoal buns, wantons in chilli oil, the signature peking duck with the colourful pancake and 5 sauces, and the coconut puree dessert. I was shocked that they couldn't serve iced water for my daughter, and wanted to charge $8 for a bottle of mineral water. I hope the management can review this and just oblige customers with iced tap water when they ask.
3
food is good, ordered the peking duck, mushroom with pumpkin sauce and the teppan beef. quality is up to par. however there were too many waiters and waitress around. they want to take away our plates are soon we are done with our food. sometimes when we are halfway. quality of service of the waiters, various. our first guy keep talking to us in mandarin, even our guests doesn't understand mandarin. where is the level of understanding? the second waiter was polite and he was kind of enough to explain the food that was being served.all in all...the food was good, but we got the feeling that we needed to hurry with our food. our last dish wasn't finished and they already asked whether we want dessert...
5
We were well served the minute we arrived. Very patient and attentive. Environment was kept clean. Very nice authentic food, must eat dishes are the abalone braised chicken feet, siew mai, salted egg yolk buns.
4
Great Tim sum, would consider the standard to be one of best in Singapore so far similar to Lei Garden at Chijmes. Enjoyed their charcoal pork bun and custard egg yolk bun. Good environment to bring infants along too.
4
I was there with family on a busy weekend. Despite being busy, the staffs are still approachable. Staff also answered our questions well even when we called earlier for some clarifications. I will say the price is on the higher side but the food is rather worth the price and wait.If you really want to pick something for improvement, I can only think of the need for the increase of the frontline staffs and the time taken for the food to be served. Overall, it is recommended to go to the Kai Garden if you are looking for quality chinese food.Thank you
5
Had lunch here today. Food was really good. Presentation was lovely! Had some dim sum like charcoal bun and cha shao shou. Very tasty. Shark's fin in stone pot was very good as always. Lamb was well seasoned and tender. Beef hor fun was just so so. I like the desserts-very well presented. Been here quite a number of times. Service from Christine was good as usual
4
Went there to try out the dim sum bcos of numerous positive review. The dishes are a bit unique but taste wise was a bit disappointing 
5
Went back twice within a week, dim sum is superb!My parents love both the porridge while I personally prefer the charcoal buns and XO carrot cake.Lobster dumpling was ordinary though.Will be back again soon
5
Go early and you get the waiter and waitress better service. Food is superb. Surely will go back again.
4
I am a Cantonese and everyone knows the Cantonese are very particular about their soups. Upon the first sip, my 70-year old mum gave the soup a thumbs up. Amongst the three of us, we ordered the XO pan fried carrot cake, double-boiled fish maw soup, mushroom bean curd dumpling w pumpkin puree, beef steak with brown sauce n radish, the vegetable casserole and Boston lobster handmade noodles. That's why though I'm a firm believer that no meal is complete without dessert, I had no choice but to skip it. The only reason stopping me from giving them 5-stars is because the captain was overzealous in recommending so many (and expensive) dishes to us petite ladies
4
Best Peking duck around. Not cheap@$88 but quality of duck, taste and presentation were the highlights. Service could be better but was there for dinner on Mother's Day so might be different other nights. Beverages are expensive. No free water. Only bottled $8. Tea for 6 costs $28. Should have ordered a jug of beer for the same price. But overall a good place. Might return for lunch.
5
Everything dishes are cooked to perfection. We love the peking duck, halibut fish in lobster soup and the kai fried rice. Our waitress, Xiao Mei was really friendly. She helped us took quite a number of photos.The dinner is slightly expensive but it totally worth paying for
5
Excellent dim sum with a good balance of new innovative dishes with traditional dim sum staples. The carrot cake is particularly good
4
The staff were very attentive. They noted my granny was feeling cold and provided a shawl to keep her warm. They also exhibited professionalism and was polite and courteous. Keep up the good work
5
We went there for the first time during a friend's birthday lunch and we really love the food and service there. Hence, we went back a second time the same week. The dim sum were generally pretty good. We love the congee and xiao long bao in particular. Main course wise, the noodle cooked from the peking duck was one of our favourites as well. One of the staff, Judy, took care of us really well throughout both dining experience. Thank you

Had the worst ever experience here today. One of our dishes took almost an hour to arrive and when I finally got tired of waiting and decided to cancel the order, the waiter miraculously appeared in one minute after the cancellation with the dish. As it was likely the dish has been sitting around for some time and no longer fresh, we insisted on cancelling it. However the restaurant plain refused the cancellatlon without providing a proper explanatIon other than "Oh it's already been prepared." The next shocker came when we teceived the bill and found out that we were charged an extraordinary sgd 8.80 per person for tea. The waitress taking our order had merely rattled off a list of tea for us to choose without informng us of the prices. Some, as it turns out, costs almost 4 times the price of others. it also does not make sense for them to charge individualiy for tea when it was the same tea pot with the same amount of tea leaves that would have been served regardless if it were for a table of ten or for two (we can verify this as we had visted them in groups of 5 and 2 previously). Again no proper explanation was given for this blatant daylight robbery. The food is decent but the service is clearly not. You may also end up being asked to pay for much more than you expected. Visit at your own risk

Well presented restaurant on the 3rd floor of the large Marina Square mall, Kai Garden does a very decent job of serving dim sum with a bit of a modern twist as well as a range of other Chinese dishes such a Peking duck (two ways). The food is generally excellent - for instance the har gau (shrimp dumplings) are delicious with a scrummy filing inside a fine pastry, the scallop dumplings are also noteworthy and the seafood beehoon is terrific. One black mark, shared alas by many other Singapore restaurants it must be said, is the continued use of shark fin in a number of dishes. The service is very good, the tables well spaced and the surroundings nicely decorated with a view over the water towards Marina Bay Sands. A few things to bear in mind are that the a/c can be a little too effective so you might appreciate a jersey. On the weekends it can get busy so brunch may be a better bet and, indeed, at 11 on a Sunday morning we had the place to ourselves. Lastly, if you have a pram, as we did, from midday the single lift nearby tends to fill up from the floor above so you may have first to go up a level to get down to the garage floors if you don't want to use the escalator.

Restaurant was packed on Saturday night but my wife and I were the only non-Chinese . Helpfully friendly staff who offer advise which is needed as many dishes are not found in traditional European Chinese restaurants such as duck tongue! Signature dish is Pekin duck, initially the skin is cut off with a sharp cleaver and that is eaten with the pancakes then the duck meat is served ,also had French style sweet & sour pork which is served on a bed of crushed ice, the pork is actually served as mince meat in a batter ball on skewers , cold outside and hot inside. Virtually all diners, including us, drank copious quantities of rice tea although alcohol is available at a price! As it was the end of Chinese New Year we were given complimentary traditional New Year sweet. Probably the best Chinese meal we have eaten. Not cheap as meal for two without alcohol was around 180 Singapore $ but well worth the money and it does take MasterCard & Visa credit card but my debit card was refused
