Excellent taste and good value for money with reasonable portion. Good to ask for less sugar as can be a little too sweet.

This is one of the best Rojak in Singapore. Rojak is kind of local fruit salad, mixed with prawn paste with peanut topping. Soon Heng Rojak is very generous with the peanut and it's simply superb!
5
The stall is located at the basement of the Toa Payoh bus interchange. Song Heng Rojak is next to the escalator leading down from the bus interchange. We will not miss the stall. There is always an queue in front of the stall. The rojak is very tasty. What makes it different from others is that the youtiao and dry beancurd are roasted before they are thrown into the rojak mixture. You can request for a generous topping of the peanuts without additional cost.

There is no doubt one of the best rojak in Singapore. They are super generous on the peanut spread. You could request for less sugar but of course, it doesn’t bring you up to the full flavor of the “original” taste of the rojak. It’s conveniently located at HDB Hub at Toa Payoh MRT station, and located at a basement food court. The stall is on the right side when you take the escalator down to the food court. If you look for good rojak, this is the place you should be. It is considered as the “king of Toa Payoh’s rojak”

Came here for lunch with my Wife, this is a star find! Here is what we think (We compared them to Hawker Centres Stalls, which are more appropriate):Ambience: 5/5 Cleanliness: 5/5Customer Service: 5/5Quality of Food: 5/5Value for Money: 5/5Our Orders:Rojak: 4.5/5The Good: This is a very excellent National Treasure! It represents the very best of what our Hawker culture in Singapore has to offer, Quality Local Food at it’s very best street style! We totally loved it, no complains whatsoever, this is something we highly recommend for all to try! The Bad: The rojak maybe a bit on the dry and sweet side for some, best to share it with people, otherwise this is a classic dish from the classic heartland of Singapore, really authentic local food that I’m very proud to recommend! The Bottom Line: We think this is one of the National Treasures that one should try!

I read about the good review and bought two $6 plates rojak filled with fresh vegetables, just roasted yu tiao & tao pok and cuttle fish. My friends and I agreed that there was too much sugar added and the prawn paste was not fragrant enough. A lady prepared the rojak and it may the reason for the average rojak served
4
So this is the famous rojak stall that my uncle had been queuing for all this time. We got to the food court just after 12noon on a Monday and thankfully there were only three others ahead of me. The ingredients were fresh and had bite. I especially enjoyed the freshly toasted you-tiao (fried dough sticks) and the bunga santan (ginger flower). I wasn’t so used to the sugar they added to the hei-ko (sweet shrimp paste) but otherwise enjoyed the lashings of freshly ground peanut. Tast
5
By far the best rojak in Singapore, folks would travel from afar just to eat here. We heard about this stall through word of mouth. The secret I believe is in their rich, tasty rojak sauce and also the generous portions. Prices are incredibly inexpensive. Line starts to form even before the stall opens but definitely worth the wait in line
4
A very delicious rojak with a queue throughout the day. Sometimes it can be half an hour to 45mins. Value for money between $3 to $5 per plate. You can ask for less sugar or less spicy if you want. Very tasty with lots of peanuts. Two thumbs up.
5
You have to wait for at least 15mins or so for the food. Always Q. The boss is nice , however the staff unfriendly. Depends whom .....The rojak is always good...Yummy ! WOrth the waiting esp for those love peanuts. Very generous on the peanut
4
Review by Dr Sim. 2 of the best Chinese Rojak outlets in Singapore. Recommended for Tourists. Long queue for lunch. Very good food. Enjoyed it. Self Service. Service is basic. Food court has air-conditioning. Regards Dr Sim
5
Indeed the best rojak in Singapore! Have been trying this for a few years because is near my work place. Always a dessert after dinner. Love the sauce and gravy with a generous amount of grounded peanuts.
5
Live the rojak. After eating the rojak here other stall rojak just cannot replace my love for Soon Heng rojak.
5
Best rojak in Singapore. I've been trying rojak all over Singapore and so far this is still the best. Generous portion of prawn paste and the mixture was done just right to give the strong yet sweet and savoury taste.
5
Saw a long Q at the stall at about 8pm but the Q of 10 people move quite quickly. One plate now cost $4 and has rich serving of the hay kor and heaps of grinded peanuts. Good tasting rojak...
5
Those who like the rojak sweet and savoury would love this dish. I sure did. The generous topping of crushed peanuts which were really fresh was the 'icing on the cake'. Superb. Great for those with a sweet tooth.
4
Generally long queues especially during meal times. Well some food are worth waiting for. We always requested for special orders which they generally would oblige. One of the best rojak we taste and truly enjoy every single bits of it. No regrets in queuing for it but you got to be patient
5
Was at Toa Payoh hdb hub to look ar some showflat samples and decided to dine at the food court at the basement. The Long queue at this rojak store caught my attention. As Singaporeans, we knew that queues are equivalent to something good. Indeed, soon heng rojak was magnificent in every aspect. Fresh fried breadstick, taupok, cuttlefish, fruits and vegetables. Generous serving of prawn sauce and crushed peanuts. The rojak comes in prices of $3-$6. A $4 serving would be more than sufficient for 2 pax! Go for $3 if you just want to snack on something after your meal. Ask for less sugar/peanuts for a healthier choice! And be prepared to queue for at least 20mins
5
I never fail to pop by Soon Heng Rojak whenever I'm in Toa Payoh. Conveniently located in the Gourmet Paradise foodcourt (near to Toa Payoh MRT Station), this rojak is my favourite. The shrimp paste is thick and gooey; made all the more sonny the crunchy peanut and sugar. The turnip is always fresh and crispy, the you tiao is toasted just right. Love the bean sprouts and little veggie added to the rojak.
5
Whenever I am in Toa Payoh area, I will definitely visit this famous rojak located in hdb hub basement food court. The rojak stall is the first stall down the escalator and there will always be a long queue. The queue seem to be never-ending but the order is flawless. The rojak portion is big and the boss give a lot of peabut, which is a big plus point. The sauce is not saltish and the you tiao and tau poh has put to microwave to make it crispy before served to customer. Highly recommended to eat the rojak
5
This is one of the best I tried in Singapore. Simply delicious. Not too sweet and lots of ingredients.
5
Delicious rojak! Can smell the fragrance of rojak as you go down the escalator. Waiting time will take 15-20min but worth the que. Rojak sauce is not too watery. Very generous in giving fruits, chopped peanuts and you tiao. Thumbs up!
5
If you arrived around 5pm there's a shorter line. 15 mins wait, the $4 packet was generous and the sauce is runny yet thick. Everything is so smoothly blended in terms of taste and combination. I haven't eaten any rojak this divine! Must try!
3
Value for money; starting at 3 dollars for a big portion. The long queue is something to be noted especially at peak hours. But for me the sauce is quite overwhelming, but taste is quite good, gets a bit gelat with more bites.
5
Made a pass a few times due to the Long queue, not for the waiting type. Get ready to wait 15mins due to some large order in front of you. Food wise...it's the best rojak ever!
4
Soon Heng Rojah is on the list. Located in the basement food court of HDB Hub in Toa Payoh Central is the base location because I just walk there but for those coming from afar, the Toa Payoh MRT station is simply a short walk to the food court. Going down the escalator you can already see people queuing. Join the queue for one of the better rojak in Singapore. Be prepared to wait 15 to 30 minutes. Sometimes longer. What's good about the rojak is they grill the tau pok and you tiao to a little crispy, the prawn paste is generously mixed in and then the generous amount of chopped peanuts are sprinkled on top so much cannot see the stuff below it. Absolutely love it. See the picture to believe
5
One of the best rojak in Spore, but only when the owner (attached picture) is preparing the rojak. Not his wife or his staff. His wife always pull a long face while preparing the rojak and always less ingredients. She always find the easy way by putting more chinese fried dough & bean curb as these 2 items are pre-prepared by others, she is kind of lazy to cut the cucumbers, pineapples, yam bean
5
If you have tried rojak here...you will never want to try at other rojak stalls! It is the sauce (with prawn paste) and added with generous portion of fine chopped peanuts! They are flexible cuz sometimes i would order just dough fritters (which they diligently toast crispy in small toaster at their stall). One lady mend the toaster, one mix rojak, one take orders. At least 3-4pax working in tiny stall. Prices start $3 upwards. TIP: Apparently Spore rojak has dough fritters, cuttlefish, cucumber, pineapple etc. Msia rojak serve mix of tropical fruits. So must try spore style! TIP: Stall located near offices area. So don't go during lunch (lunch time crowd) or dinner time (after work, queue to takeaway). TIP: it has won Best Food award 2013/2014. Truly spore local stall! (see image i uploaded
4
Tried this a few times. Requested owner not to add too much sugar. Decided to have it just in dough fritters and price remains. Other shops would have increase the price if I requested for dough fritters only. The rojak sauce used is somehow more fragrant than other shops.
5
I have been eating their rojak for decades. After several moves, I am very happy they are still in Toa Payoh Central. The ingredients are fresh, super generous with peanuts. The sauce is authentic - not too sweet, just the right amount of prawn paste, tamarind juice, sugar, etc. A refreshing part of a meal, or a fairly healthy snack on its own
4
I have been to this raojack stall for umpteenth time and still loving it. They gave my exact order of less sugar and chilies at the side. It's also a good portion for 4 Singapore Dollars.
5
Very nice Rojak, but beware of the long queue though.
Comes in $3, $4, $5 and $6 packages, can state preference for spicy or non spicy
No extra charges for takeaway!
5
Good fragrance. Generous serving of the peanuts. Highly recommended despite the long queue. Waiting time is not the that long. However, if male chef is away, standard will drop slightly. The ingredients tend to be too chunky.
4
this stall is worth a visit, bought the small portion $3 for sharing. The sauce is sweet and the peanuts serving is generous. Simply worth it.
5
It was the best rojak in singapore. The taste is hard to forget. I always eat there every time i go to singapore. The price range is Sgd 3/4/5
4
This is one stall you wouldn't miss if you enter the food court from the escalator. Greeting you immediately is a snaking queue for this delicious snack. Be prepared to wait at least 10 to 20 minutes for your turn to order and collect. What I like- Sauce isn't watery compared to others- Generous with ingredients- Reasonably priced ( $5 portion can feed 4 )Cons- The lady boss doesn't prepare this as well as her husbandIf you are a tourist in Singapore and looking for local delights, this is one place worth visiting. Within talking distance of the Toa Payoh MRT Station
5
long queue, but itw worthed. they work fast. it came with 3 sizes. I choose big size which is good for 2 people. you can have it take away too. the lotus petal guves a distinguished aroma to the rojak.price range from 3 to 5 SGD
3
Have heard about the rave reviews on this rojak offering. So I made a special trip for Sunday lunch to check if the rojak meets the key requirements! The queue was long but the wait was bearable. I ordered the standard portion with no added ingredients which cost extra. It was self-service and when the tossed vegetable salad was served, I find the plate smothered with crushed peanuts!! Its a Peanut Salad as the first thought came to mind! Then comes the tasting! Yes, the peanuts were generous and there was sufficient prawn paste to smother the vegetables, pineapple and the cruellers and the stingy portion of cuttlefish! It was sweet and some things were not distinct - the tamarind sauce to give the tangy contrast to the rojak, and the distinctive flavor of the young banana flower stalk - these seem to be missing! The miserable portion of cuttlefish was also very dissapointing - it was soft and flabby, not firm in texture hich gives a certain crunch. My verdict - very generous with the peanuts, but overall, the dish was Average with the missing tangy tamarind taste, the banana flower flower scent and the massively dissapointing quality and amount of cuttlefish! The best rojak in town, in my view, belongs to the Brothers Rojak, located at Clementi Central, which meet all my criteria for the best rojak mix! I am already missing it!
4
Yes, the twist is lots lots lots lots mashed peanuts! It's lovely.It took me 33 minutes. A short wait compared to the last time I waited but it's all worth the wait.The taste, the mixed of all salads including adding an extra $1 for cuttlefish. It makes my hectic day complete with a refreshing Chinese prawn paste salad.I must admit that I have not tried any other rojak better than this stall.It melts in the mouth. Give it a GO. You won't be disappointed
5
Chinese Rojak is typically a tossed salad of various ingredients. It comes with mixed fruits ( pineapple, cucumbers, turnips, bean sprouts and youtiao (dough fritters), and toss them with a sauce made of chilli, tamarind, lime and lime peel, and a prawn paste). The stall top-up with lots of crushed roasted peanuts. The word ‘rojak’ has entered Singapore English to mean ‘mix’
5
IMHO, this is the best rojak in Singapore. Very generous with sauce and nuts. Good servings and well balanced taste. Very consistent with quality and very attentive to customer's requests. Must have patience to wait as queues are long during meal times.
3
Perfect combination of sweet sauce and peanut. Should ask for more spicy. We order SGD 5. A big plate of rojak for sharing.
4
Although every time I had to Q for my rojak for at least 20-30mins, it is worth it all. They are very generous with the peanut n thick sauce which make every mouth so delicious.
5
This stall has been around forever. Still as good, though prices has gone up (by $0.50), the cheapest single portion (good for 2 pax) is now S$3. Compare to other popular stalls, it's still cheaper (others single portion cost easily $4).
4
The $3 portion isn't stingy. The sauce and peanuts are generously added too. I've seen people eat just their rojak as a meal.
5
Maybe I'm a sucker for good food, that why I'm always prepare to queue for delicious food. The ingredients are fresh, the paste is awesome and they are generous with their portion. When you are in Toa Payoh, you got to try Soon Heng Rojak!!!!
3
For me this Rojak resemble sweet Rojak, with content in itself is not much, just a few items of fruit, and 'cakwe' (for me its 'cakwe' more dominant than the other contents), topping with a lot of peanuts.I tried this rojak, to satisfy my curiosity as to see so many people lining up to buy it. it takes approximately 15-20 minutes to get it
4
The queue is perpetually long at any time, usually about 10-20 people long.Will only queue if i have cravings for it.The peanut servings is generous and the sauce is sweet.Somehow when the uncle does the rojak it taste slightly better then the auntie
3
Decided to forsake my main meal and queue for this. Be prepared to queue for at leave 15mins. Ordered $4 and serving size is acceptable. The ingredients are coated with thick sauce and there is a generous serving of grounded peanut. I should have asked for less sugar. The sauce was too sweet for my liking. I will come back again for more.
3
I see long daily lineups to buy rojak from this food stall. Lots of Singaporeans talk about this amazing rojak place too. So, I eventually decided to join the lineups and tried some rojak.Perhaps my expectations were too high from all the street talks, but I was not too impressed. It was good, but not THAT great. Instead of barbecued tofu, he uses (you-cha-kueh (?)) instead. I thought the sauce was watery and a bit too sweet.It was okay, not bad, but really not THAT great. I have had better from some of the other nameless Malay stalls elsewhere.The portions are great so I recommend the $3. The $3 portion is large enough as a snack for two also. Go try it and see for yourself. Maybe you'd like it a lot more than I did; like just about everybody else
4
I love rojak and will definitely try if i see one. I used to frequent Whampoa Drive Market rojak til i tried Soon Heng.
Soon Heng is the best so far & will stick to it til I find the next best one.
5
I was wondering why my friends keep on bothering me to visit this place until one day I gave in and tasted their super yummy rojak. I do not like rojak actually but this one broke my hard heart haha
4
Yummy !!! ..This is one of the best rojak that we've tasted.
Not expensive .. just like any normal hawker centre price.
The portion is big and the boss is not stingy with the peanut.
Join the queue and taste it yourself ........
5
I have Rojak all my life and this is definite one of the best Rojak in Singapore. Peanuts plentiful and the sauce is plentiful! Thumbs up! Only problem is the queue :-( hahaha
4
Always wanted to try out Soon Heng Rojak but because of the queue..Finally I managed to try it for in the queue for 15mins.I loved their rojak partly because the Shrimp paste taste was not so strong. Furthermore they gave lots of peanut. Most of the rojak that I have tried they have different type of taste. The only different if you get the taste that you like that will be your best. Try it yourself and you will know the different
4
Been here a couple of times. It's best off hours unless you enjoy long lines. The Rojas this latest time was quite good with a much better bite to the sauce than the last time. With the closure of the tonal stall in one of the kopitiams a little out of the Hub, this is the best in Toa Payoh
5
Singapore is well known for its local fare often referred to as hawker food. It is also known as #street food or #small bites frequently.It is perhaps the most colorful representation of singapore culture as it affects every person every walk of life. It is extremely unlikely that a resident (local or resident) will never eaten or enjoy a singapore local fare in a typical #coffee shop or #food center aka hawker center. Today I returned home to Singapore to enjoy one of my favorite small bites.. Rojak. This Rojak is indeed my all time favorite Rojak stalls for many reasons. 1. The taste is indeed very well balanced. 2. It is very convenient to get there via MRT(subway) toa payoh station.3. Situated in an air-con food center that is very well maintained and managed which helps to overcome the very long queue. 4. Reasonably priced 5. Individually made by the same chef (for most part of the day) 6. The stall is very well maintained7. Speaks both local English and Chinese. It makes the eating experience very pleasant and comfortable. The wait (between 20-30mins for most parts of the day) is indeed worth it. The best part of the experience is that you can customize your order to your liking and the chef will oblige willingly. Finally, back to the most important part of the review .... The food. Rojak, though in my opinion is perhaps one of the best singapore food ever created, it is not a taste for everyone. Basically, it is a salad that generally comprises cucumber, turnip, pineapple, kangkong (a form of vegetable), beanspout and fried doughsticks mixed together with prawn pasteï¼Œ grounded peanuts, sugar.The Rojak is very well mixed yet it is not too soggy and a very rich coating of grounded peanuts. If there are a few negatives, the perpetual long queue and insufficient fruits compared to the doughstick are two that I would like to highlight
4
Finally managed to try this rojak after friend's strong recommendation. One can easily identify the stall by the long queue once you get down from the escalator. I was there on a weekday afternoon around 3pm and I was 12th in line. I waited for about 15 minutes. The customer just have to placed their orders according to the various prices, and you can see the stall owner's hands are working non-stop. It is tasty if you don't mind the wait
3
Although its a good rojak wih lots of oeanut fillings, this stall is prone to mistakes when it comes to ordering. I asked for an additional century egg and less sugar. And yet, it was not even fulfilled despite paying more. Not worth waiting for the queue. There are better rojaks elsewhere
5
It was my second time eating the rojak (a kind of appetizer that is made up of fried bean curd, fried dough (you tiao in Mandarin), cucumber, pineapple etc mixed with prawn paste and ground fried peanuts) @ Soon Heng, it is not because it is not delicious, it is the waiting time. Yesterday, I waited 20 mins. I was amazed at how generous the boss was when he splashed the top with ground fried peanuts, usually other rojak stalls just sprinkle the peanuts. After trying this rojak, you do not need to try the rest in Singapore as this is one of the best rojak, if not the best in Singapore. The cost S$2.50, S$3.00, S$4.00 or S$5.00. If you are a tourist, please take an MRT train to Toa Payoh on a red North-South line. Once you exit from ticketing gantry, make a left, ascend the escalator to the air-conditioned public bus interchange. On your left, you will see "Bread Talk", "Giordano", then "Body Shop", walk straight for another 20 more steps, you will see an escalator that leads you down to the basement food court and Soon Heng Rojak is on your right. With its never-dying queue of loyal customers, you will NEVER miss Soon Heng Rojak stall. Btw, to Trip Advisor: may be you guys should provide Soon Heng boss new Trip Advisor stickers, the ones stuck on his stall are so faded.
5
Just yummy! With cuttlefish and freshly toasted cruellers and lots of peanuts!! The queue can be pretty long but service is fast.
5
Best rojak in Singapore! Been there many times. Quality rojak and hopefully it will last for a long time.
5
Located at the basement of HDB hub - Gourmet Paradise Food Court. Walking distance from Toa Payoh mrt.
Very Nice Rojak and worth the long queue. $3 onward.
4
This stall is located at the basement of HDB Hub. It is one of the nicest rojak stall I hv eaten. It even included the brown type of cuttlefish.
4
I love this rojak so far is the best that I tried in Singapore. The boss told me that the paste is from Penang. Whenever I have rojak craving, I will think of this place. The price is reasonable and uncle is very generous with the peanut powder which goes really good with the rojak. The original version is too sweet for me so I always told uncle not to put sugar. Get prepare for the really long queue
5
Gourmet Paradise in Tao Payoh is where the best Rojak is served and is only an exit away from MRT. You should try one of the most awarded rojak in town but prepare yourself for the long line which is all worth it! One of the best rojak we"ve tasted

Rojak, beloved in Singapore, boasts a distinctive haeko (shrimp paste) allure. The usual suspects are turnip, cucumber, pineapple, bean sprouts, water convolvulus (kangkong), pink ginger bud, tofu puffs (taupok), chinese doughsticks (you tiao). Well tossed physically and well balanced in taste, this is what decent Rojak should be. Sadly, Soon Heng Rojak is anything but this. Those who gave rave reviews are entitled to have their say. They loved it. Great... but is it 'rojak'?Soon Heng Rojak dishes out stuff that sorely lack the shrimp-paste kick. You can't taste the shrimp-paste at all, if you are honest with yourself. Consider yourself lucky if you get more than 2 strings of kangkong and more than 1 speck of ginger bud on your platter. Celebrate if you have more than 1 chip of pineapple. If truth be known, the entire dish is tsunamied in sugar and peanuts.The medley of traditional flavours and textures that make a decent 'rojak' has been so meddled with, only those who are mad will consider Soon Heng's efforts as rojak.Reviewers have hinted at having less sugar and peanuts. Don't be a daft stupid idiot. The missing ingredient is the definitive shrimp-paste. Without a proper whack of good shrimp-paste, it shouldn't be called 'rojak'.Like I said, if you are happy with it, enjoy it ... by all means. But, it is not 'rojak'
4
Lucky that i bumped into this famous Rojak kiosk unplanned. I find the portion quite large as we ordered $4 one for 2 ppl. I also tried Hoover's and think this one was a lot more value for money. There were more dried bean curd and fried dough. However i think the rojak was a bit too sweet and had too much peanuts with it. Perhaps I should ask for less/no sweet. I am not sure if it's best or one of the best. It's just really tasty and I'd definitely have another dish again when I visit S'pore in the future!! **I waited for 20 mins and there were around 10 ppl in the queue before me
5
Rojak is one of my favorite SEA foods, and I've tried plenty of stalsl in Spore, and this is currently the best for a few years running now. Food court price, aircon environment, super tasty food. Expect long queues during peak hours though. Go for late lunch or super early dinner if you want to avoid the super long queue
4
This probably one of the nicest rojak i have. When I have rojak craving, I will think of the Soon Heng Rojak but unless I am having super craving else I still will not queue for it as there is always long queue, at least 30mins wait. You will definitely see it when you come down to the food court.The taste is really good but kind of too sweet for me and if you see how the uncle is making, i feel scary of the amount of sugar he put, so my order always come with no sugar and in fact it tasted better with no sugar as the sauce itself is sweet enough for me. another things is the peanut powder that added on top, uncle always give a lot, I love it
