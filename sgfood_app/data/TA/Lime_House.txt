Awesome food and great vibe. Mary was a wonderful host. The cocktail menu is very good and a must try!
5
Second time this year with my beloved. And the food is just as wonderful. I ordered the steak which is great value for money. Cut is great too!
4
good Caribbean food in a cool restaurant in a great neighborhood that has become a very nice area to find food and drinks.
3
Food was great but service was lukewarm. Also asked for a dish to be made non-spicy but it came spicy anyway
4
2 friends, evening meal. Starters crab cake and jerk chicken skewers. No lime was seen but nicely presented and tasted good. Main dish - steak and lamb chops. Huge portions 45 sgd for steak and 42 for lamb. Nicely cooked and presented. No lime offered. We ended with coffee and Panama rhum. No lime offered. Friendly service. A bit on the expensive side given decor and general feel. Improvementpoints/suggestions:-music too loud makes the place feel cheap, and speakers crappy- get Sonos speakers and all will be fixed-why not serve lime if it’s lime house-I would have like to test more strong tasting jerk sauce maybe mild and strong?-maybe some flower or green stuff at entrance outside-some lobster dis
5
i love love love this place. mainly because the music is so up my alley, but also because the food is so unique and yummy. i just always forget that jerk chicken is spicy tho and i cant really eat spicy stuff. baby back ribs still hands down my fav dish here. service top notch. oh and you can use survival chic card or entertainer app or chope points to get discounts here

We had a wonderful evening last night at Lime House. It is a very cozy place and the food is outstanding. In addition they have the largest rum collection in Singapore, so if you like a rum based cocktail you have to go. Coming back to the food: we had avocado toast and jerk chicken skewers as appetizer followed by baby back ribs (just amazingly tender and tasty), blackened catch of the super (super yummy) and lamb (very tasty). We thought we had no space for desert and ordered the bill. As a nice surprise Janik the GM brought a plate of their special desert: spiced banana cake with ice cream. I am so glad he did as this desert was ‘orgasmic’ , totally outstanding and if you go this is a must. Their chocolate mousse is also nice, but very heavy and not fluffy so you must be a chocolate addict ... if not it is too heavy ... overall we will be backAnd thank you again Janik to make this evening so special

The food was okay and did not lack flavour apart from the Jerk chicken. Jerk chicken does not need to be that hot to the point were you have to pave your mouth with drink afterwards. The jerk chicken skewers were way to hot with pepper and that took away the taste. Coming from a Caribbean background you know what to expect when you eat this dish, especially when you go to the Caribbean. The sorrel and rum drink was not that enjoyable either as the taste was sharp and I could not taste the rum fully. I can say that I have been and it is nice to see the only Caribbean restaurant in Singapore being represented but I would not personally return to this venue
4
This was my 3rd time at Lime house. They have changed their menu which has a lot more vegetarian options. Unfortunately this time around they were out of a lot of items and I was forced to order the pasta which wasn't really that great. The plantain chips and salsa was really good and so was the avocado toastie. I really hope they have enough portions next time I am there as I would have loved to try the veg stew again.
4
My Caribbean friends is inviting to this hotel, first come it is a classic restorant with chinatown accent from the outside.When we get in, the place is comfy and appropriate to lime with friend (chillin).Recommended for those who wanted to taste Caribbean food in Singapore
4
This place is pretty and well furnished. The bar upstairs is cool, dark and relaxing. The sofas were comfortable. Service was great.
The drinks/cocktails menu is limited. There are about 6 cocktails, mostly rum, and some wine and beer. The cocktails were weak but tasty.
5
went there using the entertainer app. it proved to be deal for us. we had the full rack ribs and curry goat. we both enjoyed the food very much. you must request for the hot sauce if you are a fan of spicy stuff!
5
Very authentic - and tasty - Caribbean food. Tough to pick a highlight, while the service and drinks were also excellent.
4
The food was really good. The spices and ingredients were fresh and the service staff were very accommodating.
4
the restaurant was overbooked even though we had reservations confirmed. Luckily there was a table. Curry was lovely
5
It was my first time trying Caribbean food and i must say that i had an awesome experience. The food, the cocktails were great.
3
the building itself comes with a nostalgic vibe. However the food was average and pricey. Overall below expectation
5
We heard so much about the jerk chicken, and it's true - it's the best chicken I've had in ages, soaked through with that strong charred goodness. The blackened fish was good too, and it came with buttery sweet potato mash as a side. We mixed it up a little and discovered that the sweet potato mash went really well with the jerk chicken - much better than the original sides of rice and coleslaw. They should consider serving the mash with the jerk chicken instead!And the pineapple cake dessert. Get the pineapple cake dessert. I was skeptical at the sound of it but was blown away in the end
3
We had both platter versions and they are good value for money. Was it very west indian, well some were but other like the battered squid, mac balls and battered fish were very ordinary stuff you can get anywhere. I lived in Florida and dined at west india eateries so I am familiar with the cuisine.
4
Haven't had carribean food before but some of the dishes here were really yummy. We particularly enjoyed the jerk chicken, Calypso fish (tastes something like sweet&sour fish) and the upside down pineapple cake. The pineapple cake sounds very simple and humble but it was oh so yummy we almost went for seconds!
3
Service was nice and faultless. We ordered 2 dishes, Jerk chicken and Curry Curry Goat. It's okay, nothing to shout about honestly. Will probably not return.
5
This was our first time having Caribbean food. We had been expecting Latin American style food, however Lime House was something special. We'll definitely go again
5
While categorized as Caribbean, that is a misnomer; the offerings were very diverse. A great variety of dishes across meats, fish, vegetables, potatoes. Great service and lively environment as well. My favorite meal in the last five years. The Fish Calypso was especially good.
5
Been here a few times with Survival Chic card and Entertainer app deals. Love the chilled out reggae music and Caribbean food. The jerk chicken and ribs are my favorite dishes here. Mashed potatoes are really good too. Heard about their reggae music parties. Can't wait to go to one.
5
Apparently this is the one Caribbean place in Singapore? Thank god they do things well. I came here with my wife recently. Loved it. We opened with the jerk chicken skewers. She got the ribs. I got the curry curry goat. The jerk chicken and goat were both fantastic. Maybe a bit salty... but otherwise loved it. The ribs were good. But forgettable. That is, well done and super tasty. But given everything else going on here, I would steer patrons toward something else unless they really had a hankering for ribs. Which my wife did. We had the banana bread for desert. It was good. The ice cream on top was better. Cocktails also great. I didn't know "Francis Drake" was a thing. But I like it. A bit expensive (a bit). But given its location (both in a shophouse and in a hip part of downtown), this wasn't particularly surprising.
4
My colleagues/friends and I went there on Friday for after-work drinks and we were pleasantly surprised at the variety and quality of the cocktails served. We also loved the dishes we ordered - the jerk chicken and macballs in particular were tender and flavourful respectively. The music and ambience was great, the venue (an old heritage shophouse) was wonderful - we were one of the last ones to go 'cause we were having such a great time
5
One of the few restaurants i get excited about in Singapore cuz it serves up something different. We're so used to French, Italian, Japanese fare but this place you get different flavors that i can't even begin to describe cuz I'm still getting used to it. I love the sauces they use and it goes well with the rice. Can't wait to come back here again. And of course the music.... to die for
4
Great atmosphere for a quick bite.Staff super friendly and efficient.Prices on lower side of the area.We had Seabass ( cooked to perfection ), lime juice, avocado toast ( good ) and side salad ( good ).Looks like they have a nice selection of cocktails and the bar looks well stocked.Outside seating is limited to small bar tables with high chairs.Generally pleasant surprise and would recommend when in the area.Of course the play Bob Marley & Co all night long ;
5
I really like this area. I was exploring the entertainer app when we came across The Lime House. I love Caribbean food and they did not disappoint.We had an amazing jerk chicken with rice and ribs! Both were so nice, really good quality food with lots of flavor.We have a couple of glasses of wine, so with the app it was such a goodPrice. The atmosphere is excellent and the service was great.Apparently there is a bar upstairs which is more lively and really good fun! I will check that out next time!
5
Had a terrific meal at Lime last night with both of us feeling in a steak mood. The fried plantain nachos were great to start with and the aged ribeye with coffee sauce was just what we were after. The new Caribbean chef is clearly making his mark. Great vibe. Both the owner and the Manager made great hosts and we enjoyed having an insight on some terrific vintage rums afterwards. Menu and wines all well priced (for Singapore) and the dinning room had a lovely ambiance. Will brave the pulsating Caribbean beats in the upstairs Rum Lounge another time.
5
Rums jamaican, all good stuff are here hidden!
I would not be here if the hotel Concierge did not recommend me!
4
A great place to eat, surprised by the curry curry goat. Delicious. Service was also good, so no doubts, we will go again.
4
Nice place to dine and drink with friends, delicious heartwarming food and a wide range of drinks! Mediterranean food they serve
4
Located in china town restaurant offers it all
It has more of a Jamaican feel
Do have a Jerk Chicken and theres plenty of yummlcious drinks
4
Cozy and Nice place with good services. Food was also good especially for the side wings. Price for the drinks was quite expensive though
5
After long week, I decided to head out with a friend. We decided to check out Lime House, since we had heard great things about the rum cocktails and the vibe. Once we got there, we found a nice al-fresco area, as well as a very cool upstairs cocktail bar, called BAGO, which is part of Lime House. A waiter explained to us that the concept behind the restaurant is ‘liming’, which apparently means ‘hanging out with friends’ in Caribbean lingo, and indeed the place was quite buzzing!. Since we wanted to sample a few more of the yummy drinks (I recommend the Deepaz old rum and the Havana club 3 yo!), we decided to order dinner - we tried the Jerk chicken skewers, Curry Goat (surprising and delicious), and Fried roasted stuffed sweet potato and plantains. For dessert, we shared the Tropics cheesecake and really enjoyed it. Definitely a friendly, fun and cool place that i will come back to for dates or with friends
3
Was so excited to try carribean food and the menu on chope was looking good! But was so disappointed when the restaurant menu is totally different, serving just "normal" western dishes! Food portion and quality is alright. Servers are friendly, nice music vibe, a place for rum lovers i guess
1
Went with friends fir dinner, hoping to enjoy a drink on the roof bar first. Both the bar and the patio were closed for private parties. We complained to the owner, who was rude and argumentative -- never even apologized. The least he could have done was apologize and offer a drink or appetizer on the house. Nope. We left and had a wonderful meal with great service at Luxe across the road. I will never go back to Lime House. There are too many excellent restaurants in Singapore to go somewhere and be insulted
4
We spent a very pleasant evening in the restaurant. The dishes we ordered were all very flavoursome. the portions were good too. Their speciality the jerk chicken was really tasty. the young waiters were friendly and served us very well.we were given a complimentary desert to wish us on our anniversary
5
When my boyfriend told me we were going to Lime House (a resto on our Surviving Chic dining membership card) I had no idea what to expect, but I loved it from the moment we stepped in to the sounds of Bob Marley and the Wailers playing in the background. The menu offered many exciting dishes that sadly were sold out! Crab dumplings, Baby back ribs and the steak will have to be tried next time. We had the sweet potato appetizer with avocado and tomato - loved it! Fried plantains were also great for me. I have a bit of a sweet tooth. I really wanted to try the fig ice cream with cake dessert that I saw all the other tables getting but we were so full after our chicken skewers (super tender, juicy and flavorful) and curry goat with rice (excellent choice if you can handle the robust flavor of this strong meat). Overall definitely coming back for more. Great friendly service too! I changed tables 3 times to get the perfect seating and lighting and the staff didn't seem bothered at all :)
5
It's a famous Caribbean Restaurant in Singapore and it's very homely and welcoming place for a casual dinner with family and friends and really a nice place to Hang-out and the food was excellent very tasty and yummy one must visit this place for hang-out.
5
Tried the blackened fish, jerk chicken & other Caribbean dishes there. The owner & chef are both from the Caribbean and ensure that the food is authentic. Interesting flavours from a distant part of the world that the majority of Singaporeans are unfamiliar with.
4
This is my first time to the restaurant. I am happy that food and dessert turn out yummy. We love the honey and fig ice-cream! We ended up ordering another scoop to share! We will be back again!
4
The staff were all very friendly and prompt in clearing the dishes. Jerk chicken was great. Pepper shrimp might be a little spicy for some. Overall, satisfied with Lime House. Will visit again!
2
Ate at the venue just last friday with 2 friends who flew over for the weekends. Honestly, we had pretty high expectations of this place given the raving reviews online but the food we had were disappointing.We ordered Jerk Chicken, Baby Back Ribs, Blue Mountain Steak and Granny's Stew and appetizers to share. The appetizers were alittle dry, and the mains are rather salty. The ribs weren't as tender as we hoped it be, it was hard. And the Blue Mountain Steak was pretty burnt and my friend who loves steak didn't finish it.We feedback to the waitress on the steak as it was not really palatable, however the reply we got was the steak is like that as its placed on a hot bbq plate. Yes, we are aware some steak get a little burnt from the hot bbq plate but the amount of burnt on the steak that we got was tad too much. We aren't expecting fine dining standards given that it is a casual dining restaurant, but for the price we paid and the food that had been served to us, we could have gone elsewhere for easily half the price with better food standards
4
Nice little place in the happening part of China town that is full of lots of other bars. The food here is very nice and reminds me of places in Barbados. The jerk chicken here is a must have - the chicken is wonderful and tastes authentic. The chef (from Barbados) brings out the best in the ingredients. There is a bar here as well as a rum bar upstairs. Defiantly worth coming
4
I love the interior and set up of the place, it also has a great and cosy bar upstairs! We had the goat curry and the calpseo fish, I would recommend sharing it as it might be too much for one person to finish the whole dish by themselves due to the strong flavours!
5
I'm no expert on Caribbean food, but this place seems pretty authentic. Regardless of whether it is or isn't , it tastes good and that's what counts! The service was friendly and helpful. The cocktails are quite original or 'with a twist' and they are refreshing. The whole place makes a refreshing change from Chinese or Indian food :-
4
Caught up with an old friend at this place last evening. Was impressed with the service & the food quality was great across the board. I did find the serving potions a little small though that could be because of how hungry I was feeling. The Goat Curry & Deconstructed Pina Colada were simply fantastic! Go here for date night or if you would like to dine in a small group. You will not be disappointed
3
Lime house serves pretty decent food - baby back ribs and jerk chicken are quite tasty and good for sharing. Lots of people seem to come more for the bar foods and drinks / though it doesn't make the place too noisy for conversations over dinner which was good for us. Don't sit near the door as the smoking crowd from outside can quite affect your breathing if you are as sensitive as me.
4
Staff were very attentive and helpful. Food's very flavorful and love the presentation of the desserts! Music was a bit loud towards the end
5
love this place, the staff are so friendly and it has quickly begun to feel like our local. good food, great cocktails, always feels like a party.
5
Newly rebranded upstairs lounge Bago at Lime House is unique in its rum cocktails selection - at last count, they offered 152 rums on offer, and a menu strewn with imaginative rum-based cocktails to keep you happily liming all night long. The Cocoa Estate, a Caribbean take on the classic Manhattan, was rum-based over chocolate - amazing! Try the Morris cocktail - who knew coconut water and rum would mix so loverly together? Apparently the mojitos are amazing too - saving that for another night out
4
came for lunch the other day with friends. we were the only people when we got there. the server, Ages (hope i got the spelling right) was really good. i was impressed with his memory... without writing our orders, he got them right. yup he repeated it back before dashing into the kitchen. very friendly and refilled our cups of water without asking. even when 2 more tables filled up, he was equally attentive to them. so yup he was the only server during lunch time. good music and lovely ambience to just relax and enjoy the food. food wish, his recommendations were not too bad. however, the steak was too tough and tasted weird (to me). the fried fish is very yummy. i like that the portions are not huge, so we could share. loved the dessert of banana cake and ice cream. that was the best item, to me. on the whole, lunch is a good time to visit. parking was quite easy
3
The bar upstairs here is really worth visiting with an extensive selection of rum from around the Caribbean and elsewhere. A small selection of half price cocktails is available until 8pm. The restaurant downstairs is nice enough but the food is unfortunately pretty average stuff. I'll be back to visit the bar again and try some of the exotic rums, but I'll probably eat elsewhere next time
5
Decided to visit the restaurant for lunch today. Wasn't even sure they were opened for lunch but was pleasantly surprised when I saw the set lunch menu. Got there a bit later than the original reservation time I made due to weather and work but no problem. There were a few tables with about 10 other patrons and one waitress. Ordered our food, got our drinks and water was also filled up no issue. I've had experiences in Singapore where the restaurant wasn't busy and the server tends to slack off and neglect customers but she did excellent. The selections for lunch was great I thought. Food was better than I anticipated. My fiance had a few alcoholic beverages and for the price, it sure supplied the alcohol If you've never been to Singapore, alcohol prices here borders on the exorbitant range. I had the fried fish and he had jerk chicken. They were perfect. The desserts were delicious. Overall we were stuffed and happy. Ambiance was perfect for the weather (rainy and dark today) Will be back to check out the bar at night
4
Had the opportunity to try this bar. Feels a bit like a bar in Bali with the scent of the flowers/leaves that came with the drink. Very cosy, friendly services. My only complain a drink I ordered took too long despite the bar wasn't that crowded. Otherwise, it was a pleasant experience
5
The place is a 3-floor conservation house. Restaurant at the first floor, two outdoors seating areas (front and back), where one can enjoy a cigar + rum + food. The central area is air conditioned and there is a dance floor. Some nights they have a DJ spinning specially Latin tunes.Tried for both lunch and dinner, fantastic surprising Caribbean cuisine. Never got us disappointed, whenever is their corn soup, chicken, lamb or burgers with the home made jerk sauce (a bit spicy for some, ask it on the side). The fried plantains (bananas) are to die for, we kept asking for seconds, thirds... We've tried BBQ also.The rum selection is great and also the base for the cocktails, with fresh fruits. Ice cold beer always. On the second floor there is a cosy lounge with live music, sofas, low tables, beautifully decorated.There is also a roof top to die for.Staff is lovely and full of smiles. This is our favorite place to bring friends or even a romantic evening, with great food, drinks, music and doesn't break the bank!!
4
So lime is the carribean term for lepak and this place is aptly named. The pictures on the walls and the music just transports this restaurant to a beach somewhere where it's a local hangout spot. The staff were really helpful and friendly and added to that laid back vibe that makes this place perfect. And then there's the food. If you're not a fan of salads but are trying to be healthy, their prawn salad is for you. We got a whole jerk chicken to share and there was nothing left by the end of it.. It was that good! If you want to try good carribean fare this is the place to go. If you want to relax and have a good time, why aren't you there already?:)After you're done you can even head upstairs to Bajo where they have excellent service and drinks, especially if you're in a mood for rum.
5
I have been a few times to LimeHouse and also recently to their refurbished 2nd and 3rd floor. This is a great place for so many reasons. The 1st floor restaurant does spicy, authentic food to satisfy the tummy and soul. A mixture of flavours to suit most palates. The 2nd floor's new bar is just wonderful. The cocktails so delicious - we tried many - and each one was mixed to perfection, even one I ordered off the menu. The decor is truly immersive, which makes me think I am sitting on the veranda or a living room looking out over the ocean somewhere in the Caribbean. A snack menu exists for those not wanting to have a full meal downstairs. The 3rd floor, also stuns the senses with fullsize artwork transporting you into the landscape of the islands. We headed up there for a rum pairing dinner where each course, sensibly portioned, matched the cocktails. The prawns juicy, steak tartare well balanced, lamb meaty and their banana cake pudding with ice-cream to die for. A truly wonderful evening where the staff were attentive and welcoming. I am heading back there for a few rum masterclasses
4
The food was really good and the jerk chicken and goat curry definitely satisfied the craving for Jamaican food. The cocktails are really yummy too. Great for dinner with a small group as the place is quite cozy.
5
Loved the Lime House! Really relaxed. Delicious cocktails and food! Would recommend the chick pea starter and the goat curry. Will definitely go back.
5
We went here for dinner and drinks for the 2nd time and were not disappointed. The Doubles were excellent, just like i'd eaten in Trinidad! The goat curry was very tasty, all be it a little spicy! But the rum punched cooled down the heat in my mouth. Certainly check out their deserts too. This restaurant is in an nice area, for you to stroll around afterwards. I certainly need to return to check out the rum bar on the 2nd floor :
5
A very cool and relaxed place located in Chinatown. Good music.The food is delicious and portions are hearty! We have tried the jerk chicken and seabass en papillote, both well flavored and excellent. Cocktails are generous and the choice of rum is fantastic! The staff is very nice and helpful. We will definitely come back to Lime House for a Sunday brunch or to start a night out with our friends
1
I don't normally write bad reviews but hoping management will take this on board. From a Jamaican background I know how the food should taste. I ordered the curry goat with rice and peas which came with 2 slices of plantain. The food was the huge disappointment. The rice and peas had no seasoning and was cold. I had to ask for it to be reheated twice and when it came back it was still mildly cold. The curry goat was edible but not how it should be made...was more watery like a soup. The plantain was sooo over ripe I had to cancel my order for an extra portion. Felt uncomfortable with the Caribbean waiter who kept coming over to talk to me...like I was being chatted up and he gave me his contact details before I left without me asking for it :-
5
I had pleasure to visit Lime House during Friday evening. Very relaxed place with nice ambience. It wasn't my first experience with Caribbean Food, but definitely it was amazing experience and wonderful time for all of us. Pork ribs and jerk chicken brilliant with company of great cocktails. You should try chocolate cake in the end. Service was great, especially funny guy in the hat (don't remember name)!The only issue - a little bit too long waiting time for food, but as place was full of people and food was amazing - I can forgive that!I am sure we will be back soon for more, as we heard about new rum bar on second level with great selection of rums from around the world and new brunch on Sunday
4
Had a pleasant and fun evening dining at Lime House. First time trying carribean food in Singapore. Portions were good to share among friends and food was fairly authentic carribean flavours. We ordered a side dish of buttered vegetables which never came till several reminders later. However the staff was very friendly and apologetically took the price of the bill. The staff also arranged a nice table upstairs Bago bar and we finished the night with several rounds of amazing cocktails made by exotic looking bartenders. All in a great experience and enjoyable night out.
1
we were instantly put off by the service when 1. they seemed to have forgot about our reservation2. they put us at a table outside (next to the kitchen, under a leaking aircon) even tho there were empty tables inside3. despite numerous requests, refused to shift us inside, they kept delaying us until the food came. empty promises... we waited 1 hour to shift to another table but it never came.in the end, we just ate the food (which was decent) and left in 30mins. even when we left, they didn't seem the least bit apologetic. and there were empty tables inside. so much wow for the service here. will never return
2
Went in March for a date night. Greeted at the door by a bored Caribbean gentleman who tried to instill some atmosphere. Sat inside and found it too dark to read the menu. Had a starter of Fish Cakes; the description of which means something completely different to the chef than everybody else on planet earth. It came as free form lumps of batter.My main of pan fried fish was so over-cooked it had the texture of chicken, and the sauce was missing. If we could have been seen in the darkness by the wait staff we were stupidly going to try a dessert. But probably for the better they couldnt see us. My husband said his ribs were ok.Would we go again or recommend it; NO
2
Went to the upstairs bar as opposed to the downstairs restaurant. It is one of those truly awful bars in which a "mixologist" performs, the theatre being much more important than the product. The result in truly dreadful drinks - essentially just a large glass of ice cubes. The place needs a bartender that can make a gin & tonic and the "mixologist" should be given a podium on which he can perform. Stick to beer if you're forced to visit....
3
Good location, pity that the food was not as good. Seabass had to be returned as it was uncooked in the middle. Stewed chicken was so-so.
5
We had a late lunch here and found the food and service excellent. Loved the decor and music. It was just a nice chill out place.
4
Cocktails are good. Try their old fashion rum. Pork Ribs were solid.the fish was delicious.
And not too pricey.
Good place to start a night out.
4
Now open for Sunday brunch. A very relaxed and chilled experience. The must do dishes are the jerk chicken and the curry goat wraps! Great service, thank you.
5
We were greeted warmly and served by patient and knowledgeable staff with good suggestions. Cocktails were fantastic. Goat curry was 10/10 good. Jerk chicken also excellent. Spicy wings sticky crunchy and quickly demolished. Salmon tartare a little under-flavoured. Cool neighbourhood old charm meets new hip. Great meal.
4
Located at considered a pretty cool neighbourhood in Singapore, if you're driving, parking could be a problem. We had to circle a couple times before parking at another carpark roughly 10mins walk away from the restaurant. But it didn't bother us at all, it's a joy to walk through the neighbourhood, looking at the different food places and decor. You'll find many gems along the way. AMEX Platinum card is having a promotion of 50% off mains hence it's really like a one for one so its a really good offer! The cocktails were good, flavourful and artistically arranged with the basil leaves and whatnot- reminded me of MAMASAN in Bali actually. We ordered prawn mango salad (i think...?) and calamari for starters, go for the prawn salad, serving is generous and tastes good. calamari was a miss for us, extremely rubbery. felt like we were chewing on tyre. then we ordered the vegetarian stew and chicken cutlet, both tastes good but it could be the heavy flavours used in Carribbean cuisine... we were full before we were halfway done with the food. The serving was huge, great for big eaters
4
LimeHouse is located at Jiak Chuan, a quirky neighbourhood of Singapore. The vibe is chill and relaxed with some great Caribbean music in the background.Their menu is Caribbean inspired - quite one of its kind in SG!For lunch they have a set menu - pretty good for the portion and price but the only drawback is the lack of vegetarian options on there. Recently I was lunching with a couple of my vegetarian friends and they didn't have much choice - they should consider adding atlas 2 more dishes to the veg main option for lunch
5
A very cool place in a very funky part of Singapore. The food was unreal, awesome flavored with a little bit of kick. The coffee rubbed steal was sensational and the signature dish of jerk chicken was mouth watering. Drinks here are generous for this town and you pay the standard $18 for a cocktail....but they are well made! This place also has a cool lounge upstairs....so do yourself a favour and get along!
4
have been a number of times for dinner and lunch - food is very good, hearty portions with a fun vibe to the place. Wine menu is reasonably priced and service good.had the goat curry last time and it packed a punch - good spice
4
The music and the food make you feel good. The space is cute and simple. We tried the set lunch special which was $16-17 SGD. The jerk chicken was great and the lime salad was fresh and great. The banana cake with ice cream was so delicious.The manager was super sweet and funny. He checked in with us several times and was always nice to have around. If I was to be VERY picky I would say the restaurant could be cleaned a bit more. Lots of dust on the lighting fixtures above the tables. I guess it adds to the charm.We'd totally go back. The food was good and the portion size was great
4
Yes, go and check this place out. The weekend is ace when Charlie is on the door. We really enjoyed the food and music and staff. Enjoy!!
3
We came here with friends for dinner. Prices for alcohol are rather high and food was not very appealing. Okay if you're going out and looking for a simple place to stay but you can definitely do better!
1
Despite very good reviews I was shocked at the poor quality food, sloppy service, limited choice of wine and the place was half empty on a sat night at 9pm, after being billed as full when I reserved
5
A pretty nice restaurant to go and the ambiance is nice. They didn't have my reservation though but sort it out pretty fast to get us a table.
1
Staff seemed completely disinterested. Food took forever to arrive. When the food finally arrived it was cold. Got to the point where we had to clear our own plates. The food itself was ok but I have never experienced such shocking service.
3
Staff here are super friendly and they do serve some neat food items. But one should go here for the cocktails. Unfortunately, they do not have some of the cocktails all day long/ on certain days. Bummer!
The Mojito and the Zombie are must try!!
4
Restaurant is located not too far from Chinatown off Keong Siak street. The cocktails are a must try! They serve beer and wine too. Curry pork is very good too. I love the plantain.
5
My husband and I visited Lime House when his brother came to Singapore from New York to visit us. We were looking for something unique, as he'd been traveling around Asia on business and had a lot of various Asian foods...this hit the spot! We had sea bass en papillote, and it was deee-lish! They had quite the variety of vegetarian / dairy free / gluten free dishes ... and meat dishes, too, so everyone in the group was happy.My only complaint was that they were out of plantains :

Disappointing par excellence !Uninterested waiting staff - " can we order a drink please ?"" I will find someone for you " - from a waiter !Poor beer choice - a Caribbean themed restaurant with Sol and Heineken ?Crab dumplings were cooked well but sadly lacking seasoning and were bland. Prawn and mango ok but not good prawns - probably frozen.The signature jerk chicken was average at best - gloopy jerk sauce rather than that lovely spicey rub.Sea bass was ok.Goat curry needed the extra Alice sauce but was rather fatty and the rice and beans was poor.All in all a disappointing experience and worth missing given some excellent neighbours

We went for a Restaurant Week dinner for 2 & really enjoyed our set meal. Every dish had a little kick to it with a hint of spiciness without blatant burning that even a non-chilli diner found it tolerably interesting! The crabmeat dumpling smothered in a green sea of homemade callaloo with a hint of toasted coconut was superb & definitely on my favourite list. Even if the jerk chicken looked simple, the taste was quite original and my seabass in a paper pouch was served steaming hot and the okra in the sauce made it quite different. We will have to return to try their coffee steak & the whole jerk lamb rack which was an obvious fav of the regular diners. the deconstructed pina colada was most refreshing to douse some burning lips and my banana cake with ice cream was also most welcomed & worth the calories!The wait staff were wonderfully interactive and informative of our dishes and really fun to chat to - like old friends!We will definitely return......

The food WILL NOT disappoint. I will be back. A mean Curry Goat and wicked Jerk Chicken! Even the fish my husband liked!
They gave us a lava cake, special on the house for a special occasion!
What a surprise!

We were there for our workshop (upstairs) & after the workshop we adjourned to the ground floor for lunch. The location of the cafe is in China Town.Overall, the food is just average but the portion of the main course served is very generous. We are so stuffed

Liming at lime house is a wonderful experience. This place is located pretty near to outram park mrt station if you are new in singapore i suggest you use google map as you have to turn into smal roads which maynot be easy to find. Very lively place with a different style of lighting and style, the food is awesome, good vareity of rum cocktails. Very friedly staff you can see the owner walking around in the restaurent but he seem friendly to only whites. They will never keep your glass empty, if you are looki g for a place for a special occasion go for this place it might be a bit noisy but you will enjoy the food and drinks

Appetisers - Wings n tings and doubles with fish were good. Crab dumpling was partially cold.. not sure if it was not heated up properly. Jerk chicken was the best sharing platter we had. Another sharing platter we had was, beef ribs... the ribs tasted too heavy, we agreed that it made us nauseated after a few bites. Perhaps, more sauce could have helped.As it was a birthday celebration for 3 pax, we were surprised with a chocolate lava cake and 2 complimentary cocktails! Thank you Lime House

We were lucky enough to have dined on a night when the executive chef, Hasan DeFour from Trinidad was in town for an event. We didn't know who he was at first, but he just came up to our table and offered to describe the dishes to us and give recommendations. Really awesome guy. He popped by twice more that night, and even gave us samples of other dishes he was preparing for the special event!The food was interesting and delicious, the service by every other staff member was impeccable, and the overall experience was cozy and welcoming. Highly recommended

Although I like the space, the music and the vibe, it was disappointing in many ways:- booked a table via Chope and they didn't note it. So had to wait more than 1/2 hour for a table.- Rums extremely expensive, only 20$ And above rums are drinkable- food was ok but also very expensive.- toilets outside not clean and smelly.

Great fun restaurant. They had a DJ playing the night we were there. Food is great especially the jerked meats(we lived the chicken). Rum drinks are the speciality and the mojitos didn't disappoint! It's got a relaxed vibe and was both family friendly and funky. I'd recommend for a relaxed delicious dinner

Trying "Caribbean" or "Jamaican" restaurants away from home has always left me disappointed because it always turns out to be anything but. However my husband & I visited this restaurant & we quite enjoyed the tropical themed cocktails, Reggae music & jerked chicken. Reminds me very much of home. The owner was also quite nice & seems interested in making the experience even better. Get Red Stripe beer on your Menu & I will probably never leave. Looking forward to our next visit

Our family has been to Lime House since they first opened and they haven't disappointed us. They are always seeking feedback which is always a good sign. However, we have no complaints. Whenever possible we take our visitors there to experience something different in Singapore. Service is always very good and staff are always willing to share their favourites, etc. Quality of food and service is very good. Wine list could be improved, but the cocktails are great
4
The restaurant is not hard to find. Very rustic setting. Service was good. Our server was very helpful in recommending the food.What we love: for appetizer: oxtail dumpling was the BEST! We had to order 2 extra servings of this! Try eating it with the chilli. Another appetizer we love was the beef skewers, not so much of the beef itself but the sauce that came with it.. Yum!!As for the main dish, we ordered 4 main dishes to share and we love 3 of them: the jerk chicken, potato spinach gratin, and the goat curry. The one that we didn't like so much was the new seabass dish.The cocktail of the day, the Hemingway daiquiri, is da bomb!!!! You guys should try it! The best daiquiri I've had in a long time!!Oh not forgetting the dessert, we tried the spiced banana cake and coffee cream brûlée. Both were good but personally, I love the spiced banana cake, with fig ice cream (I believe it's fig ice cream.. :))Overall, we love this place, and I'll be coming back for more

Great flavoursome food, very drinkable rum cocktails and attentive staff. Staff are also very well informed.
4
Goof Caribbean food, with a good choice of vegetarian dishes, good helpful service and a great choice of cocktails esp ones with rum. Not bad prices and a nice setting.
3
I showed up at Limehouse and they said I don't have a reservation. Good thing was that they were not crowded. What if they were?
5
Very good Caribbean food, the service is also nice and smiling. A comfortable place to have a long dinner with a few friends. Try their rib and their cocktail, fried bananas are also delicious!
3
If you are looking for some Caribbean for a change, give this place a try. The ambience is cozy and with the Caribbean music in the background, it a good place to unwind.And of did I tell you they have a huge selection of Rum too!

We went one evening to Lime for a casual work function. This was my second visit - the first was for lunch where the set lunches were pretty good value. As there was a large group function on we were seated on the second floor. The food was quite good - we had some platters to share of ribs, chicken and fish, and also a few starters. There was a longer cocktail list but few wine choices. We all had fun. Service was Ok. I'd recommend this for an informal function with friends or work colleagues. It would not suit a formal work function
2
Headed to Lime House the other day for a friends leaving party. We arrived and started on the ground floor and with a few drinks and some food. The food according to my friends was very good and to be fair it looked it, unfortunately the drinks were terrible. I think the first was a Rum Punch which tasted like a watered down 'Five Alive', an average fruit juice I had as a kid. The second, a 'Dark & Stormy' was slightly (but not much) improved but certainly didn't have me thinking about jumping on a plane to the Caribbean. These were served by staff who looked incredibly annoyed at having to do their job and were making constant mistakes (despite us asking them at times to write the order down) when there were only about 8 people in there. Upstairs we had some sort of orange drink at the bar which was simply awful and seemed to be orange concentrate severely watered down. At this point most of us changed to bottles of beer. These drinks were by no means cheap and with the likes of the The Cufflink Club and Marikos next door I would think this would be a key area to stay competitive.Lastly someone who I assume was the manager was shouting at his staff in front of the customers through the night. Usually a clear sign that the staff have lost respect for him and may well explain why they all looked so fed up when we arrived. If you really think you need to shout at your employees (and I don't think there is ever a justifiable reason) then be professional and do it behind closed doors. Very nice venue and good food but perhaps some team bonding needed and sort out the cocktails

Since coming from Caribbean backgrounds (Jamaican), my partner and I had high expectations for the food at Lime House. We both agree that the food was cooked well, however the flavouring and concepts were mediocre! We ordered crab stuffed dumplings which were more like dim sum or something from an Asian menu. Caribbean dumplings should be either fried or boiled, round in shape, fluffy (when fried) and thick (when boiled)! We also ordered jerk chicken wings and found that they were just very spicy with an odd BBQ sauce smothered all over them. Jerk meat is usually served dry and should have sauces to dip it in. Then we had the ribs and snapper. Both of which were not cooked with flavours that we associate with the Caribbean.The rice and peas weren't too bad as well as the macaroni pie. We would have also liked to have seen more popular and tastier choices of rum such as Appletons, Wray and Nephew or Sailor Jerry on the menu and even Red Stripe beer..We left feeling disappointed and my partner then suffered with heartburn for the rest of the evening... Even though he only had water with his meal.We understand that the restaurant maybe trying to cater to Asian tastes but I have never seen an Italian or Greek restaurant include Asian flavours on their menus in Singapore so why should Lime House be any different? People are paying for authentic food, as you would expect in any restaurant serving a particular cuisine. Lime House fails to be true in authenticity, whilst missing the real heart, soul and vibrancy of the Caribbean

Full Lime House review here: http://ivanteh-runningman.blogspot.sg/2015/06/lime-house.htmlLime House has gained quite a following since opening in June 2013. Owner Chris Morris, a native of Trinidad & Tobago, wanted to introduce the concept of 'liming' - a term which refers to hanging out in a casual atmosphere. With this Caribbean tradition of 'liming', the Lime House offers a buzzing social calender of music & dance events, almost like a carnival of sorts. And with the friendly service and great tasting Caribbean food at Lime House, a visit here is definitely an experience!Ambience at Lime House calls to mind the beach atmosphere of the Caribbean. Vibrant coloured wooden furnishings, Caribbean inspired paintings of traditional costumes and dancing, urban world music playing over the background speakers, old rum bottles along the rafters of the dimly lit interior. The heritage building Lime House is in still retains its original wooden carvings and tiles, with rather high ceilings lending a sense of space. And with 3 floors to accomodate different occasions, the vibe at Lime House is vibrant, casual and friendly.Service at Lime House is casual and friendly, with staff offering greetings and seating diners quickly. I find them to be knowledgeable on the menu, able to provide basic descriptions of the more exotic dishes. I note that Lime House staff are also pretty hardworking, assisting to prepare / clean up the place for events, including moving sofas around! They're also able to engage in friendly conversation, especially the bartender in the Lime Yard, their backyard tropical garden themed lounge.Food at Lime House is influenced by Caribbean cuisine. Chef Hasan Defour, who hails from Trinidad & Tobago, has created an eclectic menu, a mix of African, European, Indian, Chinese, South American, and North American cuisine. This celebrity chef has introduced tasty, traditional Caribbean dishes, alongside exciting modern house creations. Generally, I find dishes to be packed with flavour, served in large portions. Prices are slightly high, budget about SGD $40 per person for a 2-course meal here. The Classic Rum Punch (SGD $18) at Lime House features a refreshing, fruity mix of house rum, bitters, orange juice, pineapple juice, and lime juice. Cooling and thirst quenching, perfect for warm evenings!The classic dish of Fried Plantains (SGD $5) originates from African cuisine, and is commonly served throughout Central Africa and West Africa. Made by pan frying ripe plantains till the exterior turns golden brown and slightly crisp because of caramelisation, then dipping the thin slices quickly in a salt water dip to make the interior soft and creamy. Fried Plantains can be served as a snack, a dessert, or as a staple item.The Sweet Potato Gratin (SGD $24) is a casserole baked dish of layered sweet potato slices, coconut cream, and garlic crumb, garnished with arugula leaves. Tasty and fragrant, you get the layers of sweet, tangy, sour, and floral garlic flavours. However, I did feel the portion is slightly small for me. This dish is an adaptation of the classic African Sweet Potato & Peanut Soup / Stew, which usually consists of sweet potato, onions, beans (black / white / kidney), garlic, lime juice, water, crushed peanuts / peanut butter, and peanut oil. It is commonly eaten in Uganda, Guinea-Conakry, Liberia, and Sierra Leone

I have walked past the lime house several times and it always looks inviting. On Saturday I woke up with a cold, and felt in need of comfort food. We booked a table at the Lime House using hungrygowhere and it's a good job we did as I saw many people turned away. We arrived at 7pm (rush in SG starts 7.30). Service is a bit slow (Caribbean style) but food was worth the wait. We had crab dumplings, and fish cakes followed by seabass and jerk chicken. Just what the doctor ordered. We have lived in SG for 8 years and the tastes we sampled at the Lime House are very different to anything I have eaten in SG before. Great place and seems popular with small groups 6+ people.

Good food often let down by poor service. Often a very long wait for dishes and many are off the menu.
1
Thanks for spoiling my pre Valentines' date night by serving us uncooked jerk chicken. Food took forever to be served. And none of the foods tasted nice at all.
4
I ate here back in February last year and I still find myself thinking about their delicious Caribbean inspired food.
The bar has a great vibe downstairs so we ended up there after our meal upstairs.
Really cool place
Would love to get back!

Great food and drinks. Definitely worth visiting. Think they opened an outlet near Prudential Tower as well. Jerk Chicken is fantastic
2
We ordered rum and mixers; that should be easy to come by, right? Not so much at Lime House. One person behind the bar on a Saturday night, in a place that serves mostly cocktails? That means you will have to wait. A long time.The first round of cocktails took a good 20 minutes to come and one of them wasn’t what we ordered. Given the wait, and as the drinks were intended to go along with the food, we didn’t bother having it changed.For the second round, after a 30 minute wait (and two follow-ups with the friendly but helpless waiters), we called the person who took our order (the manager I believe) and her answer was out of this world. An apology would have been appropriate but instead, she scolded me, explaining that other persons were waiting for their drinks and that I was being impatient (30 minutes in?) Worse, our drinks would come at some point in the evening but she could not foresee when. We had to keep quiet and smile.I don’t enjoy being lectured and talked to like one talks to a little boy, even less so when I am a paying customer. We settled the (hefty) food bill and left never to return.Food was tasty (albeit pricey) but for politeness, look into your local hawker or McDonalds

I was excited to try Lime House as I had an email from Chope about how they were vegetarian friendly, while also providing the carnivorous with delicious options.Firstly, I have to commend Lime House on the warm, friendly hospitality and service they offer. We definitely had the impression that the waitstaff were all genuinely enthusiastic about the food and concept, which always makes for a fun evening.I loved the Barra bread entree and wished I'd ordered it twice as I was a little disappointed in the Sweet Potato Gratin main. It was tasty, but very rich and in a climate like Singapore, it really needed some kind of side salad or acidic flavour to cut through that richness. I'd probably kill for it on a cold Winter evening in Perth though! My partner loved both his Caribbean Fish Cakes and Jerk Ribeye. We had two cocktails each and I didn't find them memorable, but I was mainly there for the food anyway
3
We trawled through the dozen restaurants around this area looking for something different and tasty and thought a taste of the Carribean would do it. Atmosphere is so-so, wait staff friendly but nothing to write home about. Food is expensive, pushing into the $35 mains (we come from Australia so this is pricey for us). We expected something 'wow' for the price but it was honestly steak and veg or spicey chicken we could have made at home. Lastly, the cocktails at $18 each (again, expensive so I was expecting something special) were overpowered by rum with little other flavours. Our two cocktails tasted the same and yet were meant to be worlds apart. Costing $130 for two mains and two cocktails which were all average, I wouldn't recommend rushing here anytime soon
2
The food just isn't very good. There's no way to embellish that or make it prettier. We had the chickpea breads and the macaroni pie--the chickpea bread was so spicy and greasy that it was hard to eat. The macaroni pie had no flavor, and just felt like we were chewing fat. I had the pumpkin main--the pie crust was sweet, it tasted like a ready-made one you'd buy at the grocery store
3
Great ambience & beautiful restaurant. We ordered the Wings& Tings & crab dumplings for starters. Starters were delicious & fantastic. Good size portions. For mains we had goat curry and jerk chicken & a side order of macaroni pie. Macaroni pie was well made & taste great. The goat curry was over cooked & goat was chewy as a result. The rice & peas that came with the curry was only accompanied by 1 pea. The jerk chicken, whilst it taste great, why did the chef felt the need to lather on more bbq sauce onto of the jerk season thus overwhelming the seasoning
4
I had lunch with a big group of people at Lime House.We were a group of 9 and I think there was only 1 other table of 2-3 people in the restaurant for lunch on a Friday. The restaurant has a relaxed decor, very Caribbean chic! The service was good but then again you would expect with so few people there to serve.The food was a good attempt at Caribbean cuisine for a restaurant in Asia but nothing like the real thing. Reasonably priced too.Nice for a one off I fee
5
An excellent restaurant serving authentic Caribbean food. Wide variety and they can make it spicy if that floats your boat. Efficient and friendly service. Only downside is limited wine selection. Top up the evening with a post dinner drink at potato head rooftop bar.
4
Nice food and very friendly staff. A bit over priced though. Nice atmosphere. Try the pork ribs and banana cake with vig as desert.
4
pleasant music, staff and the food was very good! The price was also reasonable. Be advised that finding the restaurant can be a bit tricky due to the narrow, winding streets.....but worth it!
3
A good ambience and a good place to chat with our friends. Music nice but not too loud.We picked up a taxi without any problems after leaving at about 10:30 PMI found the food to be quite nice, but we spent nearly $200 on two bottles of some average wine. So for four of us the bill came to nearly $400 for dinner! That was more than I expected.To be fair it might be me not being used to how expensvie Singapore has become.Desert was excellent.Service was friendly and attentive
5
We were there for dinner on the eve of a public holiday; it was really busy. Despite this, the service and attention given by the staff and owner (my assumption) was excellent! As for the food...we enjoyed our starter - double bread (kind of India-ish) and fish cake. My boyfriend ordered curry goat for main and he simply loved it :-D!! I had Carribean fish and it was good despite the fact that I was not even feeling hungry then. As we made our reservation via Chope, we even have a delicious desert - banana cake for free!! All in, a fabulous experience: It even cheered up my bf who was not in a great mood that evening :). Thank you!! 
5
Got there at 7:15pm and the atmosphere was a bit quiet. Which was kind of good for us, as we were 'catching up' and wanted to talk. But a little music would be nice.. some reggae or something :PThe service was excellent and the food was sooo amazing! We had the Jerk Chicken, Goat curry, Fish Cake, Plantain sides and the Chocolate Cake for dessert. We also had the cocktails and they were oh-so-yummy!Note: the chocolate cake is actually a choc fondant - you know, the cake with the soft, melting centre! TO DIE FOR!!! Yum!! After the meal, we went next door to Mariko... i wish we never left Lime House. Mariko was mostly empty, music SUPER load and the wait staff were rude!I'd recommend that after dinner at Lime House, get a seat in the courtyard at the back and chill with more of their SUPER delicious cocktails :) Ten thumbs up ... if only i had Ten thumbs :

After reading mainly positive reviews about this place i brought a colleague. We ordered the goat curry, jerk chicken, ceviche, and the air mail cocktail. The jerk chicken is good - if you've have never had a jerk chicken in your life and have no expectations. But if you actually know what jerk chicken is and have had it elsewhere other than Singapore, it was just a small sad dollop of jerk sauce plopped on top of a couple pieces of chicken ( the chicken was good nice though). They were definitely trying to save money by using as little sauce as possible as my friend and I were desperately scraping at whatever was left on the plate so the chicken didnt taste like something i just whipped up at fair price after getting off work at 9pm.The goat curry was OK, but nothing special, especially when you live in SG and there is good curry everywhere. The ceviche was nice, as i've never had dry ceviche before, but it was soooooo teeny tiny for the price we paid. Our table for two was in an awkward spot in the middle of the restaurant with alot of traffic going through. It was in the centre near the dividing doors and it seemed like someone said ' ok we can make more money and turnover quicker by adding just one more table". We would have moved but there were no seats left. To make it worse, one of the waiters was sprinting back and forth brushing past our table back and forth and we had to move our drinks so he didn't knock them over. The service itself was genuinely friendly, but as with most places in Singapore it was pretty slow. We asked where our drinks were and instead of just telling us its coming the girl said, " it's really busy, other people have made orders too". And we were like ok, i guess this is an over priced soup kitchen.
2
The place and deco is nice in itself but it is really noisy and most of all damn expensive compared to many other cosy and fine restaurants in town. Plus not that much food in the plate. 14 dollars for a beer and 26 dollars for a chicken curry that looked like a chinese dish. And prices exclude of course 10% and 7% charges. The bill was salty for a very light dinner. Very disappointing
3
We went here recently for my husbands birthday. The food was pretty good. The place has a good vibe but service is pretty inconsistent and let's place down. Service is slow, you need to call out. We had one excellent waitress and one who was terrible with a pretty poor attitude. I addressed with the manager at the time and I think he was humouring me by listening to my complaint as we had had a bit of an incident with one of the waitresses but they did do what I asked and additionally sent out birthday dessert unexpected which did recover everyone's perception. Quirky place, would probably come back again.
5
I was worried about some of the bad reviews but seems like they are not credible!First time here and I would say that this restaurant has a very good ambience and they sure live up to their "liming" experience that I came about in their Facebook. We had a fun time with a group of 4, and food were really good! We went there at 2pm, ordered a set lunch each (costing 30++) each and I can't complain, the food is simply amazing!Service is really good too as the waiters were very nice to us. Definitely coming back with more friends
1
Terrible place - poor service, antagonistic manager and overall a very underwhelming experience - so many better places to go to, some yards away... stay well clear.
4
loved the cool vibes... yum food..
service a lil' slow but the guys are nice... so go there when u're not in a rush..
4
3 of us had Ribs, Snapper and Curried Goat, with sides of plantain and macaroni pie. Was all great.
We also some Classic punch cocktails and green dream cocktails, again both excellent. Service was good, and reasonably priced....for singapore....
5
We have tried some amazing food whilst here for a week. We came back to Lime House again cause it was so good. Jerk chicken, ribs and palmwacker cocktail! Amazing. Caribbean in Chinatown in Singapore
1
It is a restaurant but it is almost impossible to have a chat! Music was deafening! Told the staff to turn in down several times but it only lasted for a minute before it went back up! Food was nothing to scream about. BBQ sauce all the way. Many other good restaurants in SG. Forget about this one.
5
Went there with some relatives visiting Singapore . We were a party of six and although i had been once before for cocktails I wasn't sure how good the food would be . It was excellent . Everyone thoroughly enjoyed their food. The ceviche was a great starter and the jerk chicken and chicken curry excellent. Unfortunately the goat curry was off!. Cocktails were good and service good but the food terrific.Looking forward to going back
4
We had a pretty good Saturday night dinner a few months back with friends at Lime House. I was quite impressed by the food - Jerk chicken was the standout, as were the desserts (surprisingly). The service was very random -- follow through wasn't great, but this feels like the norm in Singapore. Nice shophouse vibe, but acoustics were terrible, so tough to hear people. I'd probably go back if I have a Jamaican food craving
1
We went for Sunday brunch.It was really dreadful with only a poor attempt at rice and peas to justify its Caribbean style?Otherwise it was a very small selection of barely warm dishes which looked unappetizing and we're hardly edible.The selection of starters and desserts were even worse.The uninterested staff also served unauthentic overpriced cocktails eventually.This is the worst experience I have had in Singapore.Avoid this place even if you are desperate
2
Not the best day of the week to go perhaps but disappointing on price and quality (service friendly, no problems there) - and the chef wasn't there (hangover) so leftovers were obviously the order of the day. And a Caribbean restaurant could maybe have Red Stripe on offer, a more Caribbean sounding selection of ice-creams, and no jerk chicken or curry goat to be seen. Pity, could have been a fun place but not on a Sunday and not at this price
4
I visited here with my husband and son a week ago for dinner. We fancied a change in cuisine and saw the good reviews so gave it a try. The staff were very friendly and relaxed but were on the ball when it came to ordering and service which made for a great dining experience. They accommodated all our requests and nothing was too much trouble. The drinks list was pretty good (although no Caribbean beer!) and if you like rum then this is the place to come! Now onto the food which was great. It was so nice to get different flavours and spices. We tried a number of dishes and grazed the menu - all of which were lovely especially the goat curry, the Red Snapper cervice, the coconut breaded prawns, the caribbean fish goujons and the macaroni and cheese pie (my son polished this off and we had to get more!). The desserts were great and we had the chocolate cake which was divine and the deconstructed pina colada was a fun dessert you could also add a good splash of rum too if you fancied it! This is definitely somewhere you should try in Singapore - it is fun, has great food and ambience and great service. Gibe it a go
