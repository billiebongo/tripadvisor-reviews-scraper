Very refine Chinese food with excellent services. They even prepared a birthday cake for our celebration.

I had the dim sum lunch buffet. However, the food served took as long as an hour. For example, the fish took 1 hour to serve and usual dim sum takes 25 mins. The service and ambience was good though.
5
Been to Hai Tien Lo many times, standard still there, within my expectation. The waitress was very attentive and professional.

We went there to celebrate our Father's birthday. From the food to the service, we were not disappoint.We booked a room for 17 pax with 2 kids and everyone was well taken care of. The only thing was the dog yusheng did not look like anything on their Facebook page. It was a bit disappointing though.Anyway, we will definitely return again for the food

My second review for HTL... still exceptional in service and food after all these years.Had early CNY menu and special yusheng and it’s excellent! The “ doggy-face” yusheng was brilliantly presented and delicious.Highly recommended for Chinese fine dining. Only wished they had some view of the surrounding. Would have been 6-stars
5
Excellent food quality and unrivalled service. Service was so seamless, we didn't even notice when the tea cups and teapots were topped up. I was savoring the delicious XO sauce on its own; without any request from our table, we were served a full dish of this sauce! Such observant and friendly staff, we're most impressed! Highly recommended

We celebrated our friend’s birthday at Hai Tien Lo on Jan. 6. Foods are great as always and staffs are very attentive. My favourite dish is the sweet and sour pork and roasted chicken. They are not stingy in providing us an extra serving of its luxurious X.O sauce. I also love their tea and they are quick to refill your cup. We will definitely come back

Booked the Ruby Room at Hai Tien Lo for a special birthday celebration. Largest table that seats 27 people, very impressive! Largest lazy susan too! Service staff were very attentive and we felt well looked after and very comfortable in the private dinning room. They do impose a minimum spend but can be flexible which is great! Can also bring in own wines which is a added bonus for us if you have a special bottle to open! Overall a very positive experience

Had my mother's birthday celebration at Hai Tien Lo. The waitress (sorry forgot to ask her name) was professional, knowledgeable, courteous and efficient. All other wait staff was polite and friendly. Food was good and made my mother, a picky eater, happy. A bit pricy, but definitely worth the expenses.
5
The service staff is incredibly well-trained. They were quick to seat us and make us comfortable with warm smiles and kind words. We held our wedding there 2 years ago and were back for our anniversary dinner. Wilson was still able to remember us. If that is not good service, I don't know what is. As usual, the food was really, really good. We tried out the buffet lunch at the staff's recommendation although we were just there for dim sum initially and we were not let down. Every item that came was better than the one before. We left with very happy stomachs and warm hearts. Will definitely be back again. Thank you for the experience, HTL! :

Service was good and attentive but a tad slow. Food was served luke warm not sure why. Only tea was piping hot. Was expecting some surprises on the food but tasted bland and one dimensional.
:(
5
Had a great lunch enjoying the dim sum buffet here with my family. Menu item had a good variety but the price was slightly steep compared to other more value for money buffets at neighbour Ng hotel restaurants such as Peach Blossoms.
3
For the price Iâ€™m paying , not really worth it. Food is average dim sum is average, most of the food are not made on the spot. You can pay much lesser for better quality dim sum if you are looking at their dim sum buffet.
3
I come here for my dim sum fix a few times a year, and the food has been consistently good. Nothing mind-blowing, mind you, but just solid, well-executed dim sum fare. The service however, was found wanting. During this visit, they served the wrong congee (there are two types on the menu). I did not realise it initially as I was helping my toddler in the restroom when it was served (I alone did the ordering for the table), and my parents had started on the congee before I returned. When I pointed this out to the waitstaff, I was not offered an apology, only an assurance that they will check. Eventually, the waitstaff returned to say that the kitchen made a mistake, and would I like to place another order for the original congee I ordered? For an establishment like this, I expected better. In the end, another server stepped in and offered to provide the original congee ordered on the house. The second incident during this visit involved another dim sum order - the duck noodles. After waiting an inordinate amount of time for the noodles to arrive, we enquired, only to be told that the order was not placed in the system. This, after I had double checked with the waitstaff on the items, when I made the original order! I am not sure whether this oversight was attributable to the fact that the waitstaff took the order on a little scribble of paper (not a proper notepad), but this and the first incident definitely affected our overall experience.
2
After reading some of the reviews. I realize I am not the only one who felt that the service was not up to standard. Although I had emailed the hotel regarding my feed back on the dining experience, the manager simply just replied that my feedback would be shared with the team necessary improvement would be made. However, judging from the reviews from trip advisor posted months ago and the service I received few days ago, I do not think our reviews/ feedback on tripadvisor would result in any changes. But I do hope that restaurant managers would mean their words and really look into the services of their staff. Anyway I doubt I would return to Hai Tian Lo as there are definitely better options in term of food, service, ambience available

This very good Chinese restaurant serves delicious food in pleasant surroundings. We have eaten there several times and each time the food is excellent. The restaurant is located on the third floor of the Pan Pacific hotel looking and you can look out over the atrium or sit in the attractively decorated interior room. Service is good, although staff seem a bit rushed at times. Great for dim sum or a la carte
3
Was waiting at the front door, not being served. Wanted to make an order, cannot find staff around. The tea was regularly refilled after every dish. The environment is quiet and good for business. However, the food was mehh. The char siew was too tough, pumpkin sago dessert is not smooth, fried rice was dry. The only good was their dim sum, but it just seem average. Dont think i will go again
4
Came to eat the hairy crabs and ordered some additional dishes to complement. Hairy crab was good and the other dishes (crispy tofu in spicy bean sauce, corn soup with beef, pork shoulder noodles) were equally of good taste. Only thing strange was not sure why the hairy crab was served last
4
We thoroughly enjoyed the food at Hai Tien Lo, the soft shell chilli crab was particularly fantastic. The ambience is a little odd as we were seated on the balcony overlooking the hotel foyer and buffet restaurant so it felt a little like eating a great meal in a food court. Service was a little perfunctory and given the size of the bill could have been better

7 of us went there on a Sunday for their dim sum lunch buffet to celebrate Granny's birthday. Dishes which were memorable include the mini Buddha Jump over the wall, the very fresh poached prawns, the smooth and fragrant herbal chicken etc. Most other dishes were also value for money, with scallop, lobster and abalone selections. The roast meat selection was not impressive, you may want to skip this for the other stuff. Hai Tien Lo charges its tea by the cup, but you are not allowed to select more than 2 types of tea for a table of 7. According to the young service staff who first attended to us, despite the fact that you are paying for each individual cup, having more than 2 pots of tea per table will make it harder for them to serve us. Personally, I would think that service staff should be better trained to deliver the message to us; instead of just telling us plainly in our faces that even though you are a paying customer, you don't have a choice because this makes our job tough. Otherwise, they should consider charging us by the pot instead. Not sure if it is because of the questioning, a more veteran staff took over our table for the rest of the meal. When it was time for dessert, she told us that it would be mango pudding for the day. Subsequently, she dished out papaya pudding - it was a miserly piece of papaya with a milk pudding tip. Since it was last minute and not everyone takes papaya, we took some time to decide whether there are any alternatives we could switch to, past the last order timing. Needless to say, this veteran staff was not quite good at hiding her impatience.Overall, their dim sum buffet is value for money. However, considering that Pan Pacific hotel is a 5 star hotel after all, service standards can definitely be improved.
5
After our meal there a couple of hears ago we went back for another go and the food was as good as it was before.
Service was efficient and we were not rushed. An excellent restaurant.
4
Went on Saturday for dim sum lunch. The selection was limited but taste was good. Service staff were attentive. Should provide proper kid's cutlery.
4
Overall the food was good, however the waiting time of food served was abit slow having us to wait blankly for the next dish to be served.
5
The restaurant gave a slice of cake for my daughter to celebrate her birthday with a candle without charging us. Truly, very grateful. The food were nice. A lot of attention were given to us
3
The abalone and goose web dish was nice and the fish maw soup was great albeit it would taste better if the soup was hot instead of at room temperature. The rest of the food like the dim sum & the carrot cake was average considering the price
4
Was with friends out for dinner on a weekday. Ordered their signature stir fry beef dish, was very well seasoned and cooked to perfection, definitely worth the money.Also had other vegetable with prawn dishes, fried noodle, etc. Round it off with their red bean paste pancake.Excellent food. Nice ambience and attentive service throughout
5
Hai Tien LoThis is the first time we try this Restaurant which is newly renovated in Pan Pacific Hotel.It's a fairly large restaurant which situated on the 3rd floor with a Oriental influence.The menu looks inviting they have different portion ranging from small, medium and large.That's so good when you are dinning with lots of smaller portions.We love the scollop and wasabi prawns for entrees, braise sea cucumber with grouse web and fired rice with school prawns.Great food and service.Will be back
4
Came to this dinner for a family reunion. The restaurant was part of the Pan Pacific hotel and we chose this as we were staying at the hotel.The menu was as comprehensive as menus go for Chinese restaurants. The wait person recommended all the chosen dishes and her recommendations were faultless.The restaurant was beautifully decorated and looked classy. The food complimented and matched the ambience.Overall a very enjoyable evening
1
Terrible waiting time despite having a table reservation, only to be disappointed that a required table is not available. Very appalling standard for a reputable restaurant.Was here for a business lunch and I had a table reservation for a small group. I arrived early to ensure everything is in order before my guests arrived. Upon checking my reservation, the wait staff left me waiting for almost 15 minutes! After I inquired, they said they had given me a large table and were waiting to see if one of the smaller tables will finish soon. I was appalled but had no choice since they have no other table for me. Upon arrival of my guests, they offered us the large table or we can wait for a smaller table as a guest has requested for the bill. We waited almost 30 minutes and there was still no smaller table! We were offered a large table in a booth/ semi-private room. We took it as it was already very late and the entire experience reflected terribly on me as a host. I was offered 10 percent discount as part of their service recovery. While appreciated, the damage was done and I doubt I will return
2
Ambience tick. Service tick. Cutlery so gorgeous tick. Food sucked! We are talking about $56 (not including taxes and service charges) per pax for dim sum that's supposed to be at least yummy if it cannot blow me away. Only bbq pork bun, bean skin rolls, steamed spare ribs, fish maw with minced prawn paste and desserts were a hit. Don't even get me started on the so called speciality dishes that each table can only order 3 kinds. The rest cannot even beat tim ho wan. Sad waste of $ and calories
5
Brought my business partners for lunch in their private room, nice set up with good ambience,suitable for business discussions, their set menus are quite value for money, service is very attentive too
3
The varieties for Dimsum is limited. Not many choices. However the service is recommended and the waitresses are polite.
5
Excellent lunch set menu. Good and reliable service makes it an ideal business lunch venue. Will come back.
5
Quality of food was great, the presentation was good too, and the service is five stars... lastly i like all their tea!
4
Good chineese food in a classy setting at the Pan Pacific Hotel Singapore. We had starters, "Beijing Duck" and "Pepper Beef" and everything was very good. The service was a bit slow and prices a bit expensive, however "all-in-all" a good experience.
3
Glad to hear that the chef here comes up with new dishes every now and then.
Came for family dinner and pleasantly surprised with the simple but rich tasting seafood toufu as well as broccoli with home-made XO sauce

We went to Hai Tien Lo for Dim Sum Buffet on Sunday to celebrate my husband's birthday and it was one of the best we have been. The service was fast and impeccable and there was a huge variety of food to choose from. We were served by Apple and Fancy, and they were so friendly and professional. The food was served promptly and the staff was able to give us the best recommendations for the dim sum. When I needed hot water to warm my baby's milk, they even went to the extent of helping me change the hot water after 10 min to ensure that it was still hot. Overall, the buffet was very value-for-money and delicious, and our family of 10 thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. The service was really one of the best I've ever seen. We would also like to thank Keith from the front desk for recommending this restaurant to us. Will definitely visit Pan Pacific Hotel and Hai Tien Lo again

Within a superb hotel, this restaurant definitely offers delicate Chinese food, but at a price.. a few wonderful dishes, abalone, scallops, steamed perch, great rice, nice noodles, but a few average dishes: the jelly fish and sea cucumber did not find enthousastic buds around the table.Service was very slow, spoiling a bit the pace of the dinner, although we were not in a rush.The drinks list is impressive with a large selection of beers and cocktails, and the wines list is quite unique: many wines between 2500 ansd $7000 Singapore...with the cheapest at $288. Can do better although our choice was good with an Italian red at 400...Really expensive though for what it was, even if we are in Sinagpore, in a top class hotel
3
We went there to celebrate mum's birthday and we were disappointed, but saved by 2 waitresses and some good food.Disappointment:The soup and abolone of Buddha Jump Over the Buddha were below averageThe kimchi in the lobster kimchi also below averageNot worth the money since the above 2 main dishes were below parThe serving time was extremely long...guess what? It took more than 1.5 hours for some of the dishes to be served. Reasons for 3 stars instead of 1:Thanks to the 2 waitresses (Ms Shu Lin and Ms Mabel) for serving us patiently, always with friendly smile, doing recovering service as we were running out of patient waiting for our food.Desserts were quite good but lacking in choiceTeaty food and fresh ingredients for the rest of the dishes.We visited these restaurants numerous times and always had high ratings except these time. Hope these was one off
3
We went there for my GF b/day celebration. The ambience is no longer like the one before they move down to 3rd level. Waited quite a while for the food to be served. Apparently, the chefs must be quite new, food doesn't taste so exquisite like before. Taste balancing was way out. They were kind enough to accommodate the b/day request by giving 寿桃. Don't think will go back again
4
One of the best Chinese buffets around. Good spread on the menu, and value for money. Was there for a celebration and restaurant also prepared a cake.
5
from the salad, to the clear soup, to the light mango tapioca dessert, the taste and proportion was excellent
5
We had a nice set dinner tonight. The timing to serve the foods were nice. Not too fast or late. Good quality of foods and good ambient too. Will be back someday to try their a la carte.
4
Great service and nice soups. Food generally good except for certain dishes like the fried cod fish which is disappointing.
4
Food is good but expensive. Good service . Situated inside Pan Pacific hotel but can reached by marina shopping complex.
4
With a larger dinner party. Excellent food was served, dietary constraints were efficiently helped out with. Attentive service.
5
The yum cha here is pretty good. Very authentic and delicious! The a la carte dishes were great too. Hai Tien Lo has been around for a long time and their quality has maintained if not better...
3
We went for dim sum buffet. The menu is not the same as what was featured in their website. Waiting time was long. Food was average. The staff who attended to us was not friendly at all. Not worth the price we paid for. For the same price, many other better options are available. Not going back for sure
3
Had the same a la carts buffet two years ago and had good memories so decided to head back expecting another excellent meal. But I was disappointed as the range of dim sum items on the new a la Carte buffet menu was unimpressive. Previous wonderful items such as steam dumpling soup and baked items such as char Siew sou all off the menu. Worse, I was looking forward to the pomelo mango dessert and that's off the menu as well! Prices have gone up since my last visit so I was not impressed at all. Environment is still lovely and service was good but food delivery was also slow despite the restaurant not being crowded. Unlikely to head back any time in the near future
5
Sliced Barbequed of Beijing Duck and Roasted Barbequed Suckling Pig are 2 of the most excellent dishes which this fine-dining restaurant.Double-boiled Fish Maw with Bamboo Pith in Fish Bone Broth is one of the best soup that was tasted in this restaurant.Dim Sum is awesomely delicious for those who likes to have high-tea in a traditional Chinese restaurant.The colours of the food are too attractive and the display is superb that you could not bare to 'destroy' and put them in your mouth.The Porcelain plates, bowls and cups are too attractive to be missed
4
This is my third time at Hai Tien Lo. I continued to be impressed by the high quality of Tim Sum and the dedicated service from its staff.
5
Great ambiance, excellent service and quality food.
Been always a patron at Hai Tien Lo and its never a disappoint visit
4
The food was good but we were very happy with the service of the staffs. They are all very attentive and courteous to our requests. I will definitely visit them again for future events.
5
Very nice Chinese restaurant with great specialties on the menu fantastic wasabi shrimps
Good service and nice setting
4
The family love the roast chicken and double-boiled soup. Good service as it is expected from a hotel restaurant. Will be back again
5
We totally love the yu sheng! Ordered twice for CNY eve and again for second day dinner take away. The packaging was very nicely packed and we enjoyed the yu sheng with boston crab! Very appetising and refreshing. Shall order again for next year! Awesome experience. Thumbs Up!

5
Brought my daughters back to our Favourite restaurant again as strongly requested by the two little princesses, they absolutely love the double boiled four treasure soup, the Cha Siew Bao and the finish noodle, staff are friendly and efficient as usual, keep up the great work!
5
My family lunch experienced atHai Tian Lo was really impressive. Was treated with great service and excellent quality food. One could hardly complain. Ambience of a traditional Chinese setting. Good place for business and family dinning. Lovely cuisine.We must thanks your excellent service personal namely, Mee Ying and Bonnie that came with cheerful smiles. They are an asset to your established organisation as they have proven to be more than excellent. Mee Ying knew her role well by giving great recommendation on the various foods to order.Â As we left the premises waiting for the lift. Bonnie came running to us handing back my phone battery pack which I had left behind.Both have up the level of the your restaurant'sreputation

My wife and I are completing 12 days here at the Pan Pacific hotel Singapore and our stay was absolutely superb. From the moment we stepped inside the hotel to our final minutes, we have been completely satisfied. Our room had a spectacular view of the Marina Bay and was super accommodating with all the amenities, a large bathroom with separate shower and bath tub along with a very comfortable bed. The staff here are amazing and each and everyone we had contact with went out of their way to make our stay amazing. I have to give honorable mention to Steve and Ralph at the lobby bar who not only made excellent beverages but always had a smile and kind words to make for pleasant conversations, great job guys. Also Andrew and Elsa at Keyaki Japanese restaurant made our meal there the best in Singapore. These two actually made our last night in Singapore a night to remember and Rossana and I will never forget you both, thanks again my friends. All in all nothing but great things to say about the Pan Pacific Singapore, thanks for a truly memorable stay. Bill and Rossana

I have visited this place whenever I missed having Tim Sum. Simply love the place and the service. Thanks to all the attendance and especially the manager, Apple to serve us.
5
Very good service staff, always attentive and top up our tea.Having dim sum buffet lunch. Restaurant with nice ambiance, yummy-licious food with quite a number of varieties on selection.
4
The ambience was good in those private rooms and the tables facing the hotel lobby. Food tasted fantastic too

This is my first time visited this restaurant. Not particularly impressed with food, price and service.

Having dim sum buffet lunch. Restaurant with nice ambiance, yummy-licious food with quite a number of varieties on selection. Great service & staff with knowledgeable & explain well with our question on the dishes. Overall the lunch have ended with good experience.
5
I have eaten in this fine dining Chinese cuisine restaurant many times. The food is ALWAYS super...but almost as good food can be found in other similar restaurants for less money. Previously, the restaurant's other attraction was it was high atop the Pan Pacific with great views of Singapore or the sea shipping lanes. Recently renovated it was moved. The wasabi prawns here are the best and serve as my model for comparison with other restaurants
5
Ordered their Dim Sum Buffet. SGD58 ++. It allows you to enjoy 1 soup per person, 3 mains per table & 3 desserts, on top of free flow Dim Sums. Good value for money if you don't mind overeating during lunch. Their quality of soup, Dim Sum, main dish & dessert is easily top notch even though not up to the level of "truly amazing and outstanding", like, for example, Summer Pavillion. (2 Michelin Star) But still a very nice restaurant for business lunch
2
We were hyped up by the hairy crab season, booked lunch for 2! 1 tiny hairy crab, 2 bowls of soup, 1 steam rice and tea $140 sing. Both left hungry, service was excellent however not sure if the food taste matched the price tag. Won't be coming back particularly there's so many great eatery places in Singapore for 1/10 of the price.
5
We ordered dinner from the ala carte menu. Didn't see "soup of the day" in menu, so ordered few individual portions - standard above average. I was impressed that my hot and sour soup came with two large scallops! Steamed sea perch fillet in abalone sauce was excellent. The braised beef brisket and tendon was really good too - I washed down two bowls of rice with that alone! Note that it doesn't come with turnip, which is what we normally expect. The prawn balls and scallops in Szechuan sauce was nice. Also got a Chinese spinach in superior soup - common enough but well done. We basically got all the yummy dishes to go with plain rice. The desserts were fantastic - I had a most delicious coconut ice-cream drapped with avocado cream. Throughout our meal, we had pu-Er tea... but theirs is somewhat special - they also put in some rose petals, which confers a pleasant note to the Pu-Er. Good job!Service is super. The waitress even topped up the XO sauce (served individually) for one of us halfway through our meal!!!! Finally, I must add that I did visit this restaurant a few months back and had ordered their individual signature set menu for dinner - that was excellent, if you want to save time thinking about selecting items.
3
Not a spot to see the carts chugging around here you order a la carte and the dishes arrive. Very beautiful decor, good service, regular top ups of jasmine tea. Food good and tasty and appears popular with locals and tourists. Good quality but unremarkable foo
5
Online the set lunch cost $48 per person but the menu at restaurant stated $56 per person. There was nothing less.
4
Came here for the Dim Sum lunch buffet. Every menu item is of good quality.
Good service and Ambience completes the whole dining experience
4
We really enjoyed the great service of Apple Thong, who recommended us some really good dishes! Will definitely be back for more yummy food.
5
Just wanted to say that the food at Hai Tien Lo was amazing and the service by Mabel and Erica was superb. They were constantly keeping track of what we wanted and attending and anticipating our needs. Thank you for a lovely evening.
3
Quite surprised this time round, as the dim sum was not as fantastic as I remembered it to be. I'm not sure if they're encouraging patrons to go for the buffet as the ala carte dim sum menu shrank tremendously. We did order from the lunch menu as well, and it was just as disappointing. Found out that the menu changed just 2 weeks prior, what a waste!Felt that it wasn't worth the price for that food, even though with a 20% discount, all 7 of us left disappointed.The only 3 things that were nice were, the xiao long baos, the chee cheong fun and the char siew bao. Don't order the scallop ee-fu noodles, it took bland to the next level ... none of us ate more than a mouthful of noodles. The spinach with superior stock had a overpowering ginseng taste. I guess we won't be revisiting
5
Celebrated dad birthday celebration at HTL and all guest walk out happy after the meal experience. Special thank to Minnie and Wilson who greeted all our guest with a smile even they are busy serving other guests. A proper follow up call to ensure that our request were well prepared and follow up by Zac and Wilson. During the dinner, was served by Bonnie, Mabel and Apple who were observed to be working as a team to ensure that the dinner went smoothly and professional service was provided to all of us. The manager on duty, Mr Vincent came in frequently to ensure that the dinner and food was served on time. He sincerely ask the host for feedback and thank us for choosing HTL. The team created a surprise by presenting the birthday bun which was nicely decorated and the team sing a song upon arrival of my dad. The dishes that we ordered in the menu was well served and all food were served warm with individual plating. We were very surprise that the plating and the food presentation has improved a lot compared to my last visit in early 2016. Special thank to Chef Yong and his kitchen team for ensuring that each dish were prepared by ensuring that consistent taste and standard are met. Once again, thank you HTL team for creating a memorable experience for all of us
5
Very good service staff, always attentive and top up our tea. Gave good recommendations base on our preference and not on purpose recommend the most expensive one on the menu.. gave us a semi private area which allow us to talk in private... Food are not loaded with salt nor msg. The natural flavor of the food allow is to taste the sweetness and nature(real) Ingridents used.
4
We had the weekday dim sum buffet at $56++ per pax and there was a good variety at Hai Tien Lo with decent quality. Other than dim sum, there are also 2 dessert portions per pax as well as selection of other main dishes such as fish and beef brisket to go along with the dim sum
4
Appointed a good table with prompt service. The food was delicious and the price tag was surprisingly low. Its a strange layout of a restaurant almost felt like it was on a corridor within the hotel (which it is really) but the food and the service soon helps you overlook this
5
Bought some Durian Snowskin Mooncake from Hai Tien Lo and saw that they also had a special Mid-Autumn festival set dinner menu and new Claypot promotion. My family and I decided to have dinner there as the menu was very appealing with a huge variety.Food was amazing, service staff was friendly and ambiance was good too! Turns out to be one of the most memorable Mid-Autumn festival I have ever celebrated. Not to forget, we ended the dinner with yet another surprise of how yummy the Durian Mooncake was. Definitely looking forward to my next visit! :
5
The Hai Tien Lo never disappoints - great food, great ambience, knowledgeable staff who are warm and attentive. I am a regular there and keep coming back. Only wish the price as lower as the difference between weekday and weekend brunch is very substantial.
5
Highly recommend. Besides the pleasant and comfortable ambience, we also have a great dinner there. Reasonable prices Tim Sums and main course provided.
4
Condusive environment however limited selection of Dim Sum from Alart Carte but the waitress is willing to recommend other selections from the main course.
5
Had a sumptuous spread of dim sum at Hai Tien Lo's weekday a la carte dim sum buffet (S$56/person)! Every item came served piping hot and generously filled, we would have liked to order more but were limited by our stomach space. Such a great buffet definitely warrants another repeat visit soon
5
Here we back again to our Favourite Chinese restaurant to celebrate my mum's birthday, never failed to feel welcome and been well taken care of as usual, we are surprised to find out their latest 30 years anniversary sizzling Claypot promotion with 30 different Claypot dishes(our family love claypots) at only $33.3 for any two items and its including all ingredients like chicken, duck, beef, pork, seafood, veg and even rice and noodle, what a selection! All dishes served sizzling hot with great flavour, love it! Not to forget the still serve their other signature dishes like Peking duck and steam fish. We had a great time and my mum is very happy as usual! The staff also introduce their newly launched weekend brunch with LIVE station of "Kong Bak Bao" we will definitely come back again to tr

I visited Hai Tien Lo with my family to celebrate my dad's birthday in September. We had trouble finding parking lots so my mom went up to the restaurant to keep our table booking at 7.30 (there was a wedding dinner in one of the hotels), but there is valet service available at Pan Pacific hotel ($15 for 5 hours or less, $20 for 6 hours). Although the parking issue put a damper on our mood that night, all was righted when we set foot into Hai Tien Lo. The staff were very well mannered and guided us to the table where my mom was seated. They had a plate of snacks (roasted walnuts? I still have no idea what that is) while we browsed the menu. We decided on the chef's special set menu - it's a 6 course menu to celebrate the chef's tenth year with the restaurant. The food was amazing. My favourite was the fish maw soup, followed by the fish noodles. I made the reservation for the restaurant on HungryGoWhere, and indicated that it would be a birthday celebration. My mom informed the restaurant staff that we were celebrating a birthday (before my dad and I arrived) and to her delight, they replied that they had already made the necessary arrangements. After we'd finished, the staff brought out a plate of mini siew tor (lotus prosperity buns?), which are traditionally eaten on birthdays to signify long life and prosperity. The waiter even produced a candle and lit it, he also gladly took many photos for us when we requested. These small details really completed the whole experience and made it a truly enjoyable night :

I brought my partner at this restaurant first time and he was amazed that the quality of the food and very friendly service we received from Michelle Siao and her team at this Chinese restaurant. Very good original fresh Chinese food. Cooked to perfection. Well presented. The restaurant is in the third floor in the Pan Pacific hotel and overlooks the massive interior hall. Still very quiet and pleasant setting. We would always come back
5
We had a great Chinese dinner in this restaurant in the Pan Pacific (where we are staying). Typically cautious about Hotel restaurants, we were amazed with the quality of the food, its freshness. It was well presented. The services from Jenna, Alan, Yann Ling and Michelle was wonderful, friendly and attentative. We could always come back here to a very nice and quiet setting

Held my wedding lunch at Hai Tien Lo.From planning till the actual day, Wilson and his team has been most helpful and accommodating. I did not get the name of the 2 waitress serving our room but they are fantastic in their services.The decor of their Ruby room is beautiful and very classy. Perfect for company gatherings or small events. Lunch was a 9 course meal and all our guest had very good comments of the food. Portions are good and food quality is definitely there. Even my overseas guest had nothing but good comments.We will definitely be back

Have a great dinner at Hai Tien Lo with family members. The food here are delicious and the staffs here are super duper nice and friendly. Thanks for the services that provided by Apple , Mabel Chong, and the rest who served us ( The Wong's Family

Service Staff was very helpful and attentive. Food was excellent always accommodate what the guest needs. I would recommend that place in the vicinity despite others restaurant in the area
5
We have a great dining experience at hai tien lo! Food was excellent. Service staff's warm and welcoming disposition never fails to make guests feel welcome and valued. Thank you for the great services provided by Yann Ling, Angel, Michelle Siao and Mabel!
5
We all enjoy and great varieties of cantonese dishes plus very good by Mee Lee.. Affordable prices and we recommend to all our friends and family. We will be back again soon. Compliments to all the chef who prepared our order. Burp! Haha
5
We have a great dining experience at Hai Tien Lo. I would like to thank Michelle Siao for her excellent service during our last visit. She is extremely pleasant, her smile was genuine and her manner friendly yet professional towards everyone. Thanks.
4
A family lunch, food is generally good. Must say that the Peking Duck is good, Tao Fu dish is delicious too. Funny is that the waitress seems to went missing with my Chinese tea, have to tell them to place the pot on my table. I give high marks for ambience and food, but average for service. My own experience of a high end Chinese restaurant is the "captain" will give you advice on food but that didn't happen. Although I have the benefit of research before i visit this restaurant
5
With friends for lunch. The dim sum and service are very good. Also to help my friend arranged for a birthday cake to celebrate her birthday. Special thanks to Apple Thong and Michell Siao. They provided the excellent service for us. We will definitely come back

We so enjoyed our previous visit to Hai Tien Lo that we returned with enthusiasm on this visit to Singapore. Sadly this visit was less enjoyable, the menu appears shorter, our selected banquet was rather unexciting and over-priced and the wine list included only very expensive options. Perhaps we set over high expectations but this visit seemed rather dull and the decor tired
5
Great setting, view and dining experience at Hai Tien Lo. Took a client out for lunch - service is great; had a combination of dim sum + several mains. Food served with highest quality and if you are a fan of durian ~ they have one dessert - Fried Durian Ice Cream. You should not miss this. Price wise is on the high end ~ but recommended for special lunches
5
Hai Tien Lo never fails to serve delicious food. Had lunch with Friends today and always enjoyed their Tim Sum and dishes.Loved the cod fish dish today including the soup that my Friend ordered . Service was excellent as usual. A nice place for business lunch. Worth a try !
5
Apple and Jenna provided exceptionally good service, by providing good recommendations for food. Will be back again tomorrow.
4
The dishes are simple but the ambience is nice. Everything was good but the desserts are pathetic. A bit pricey but a posh place to treat overseas friends.
5
Restaurant with excellent dim sum. Services by Ivy, Mabel and Apple were also prompt and friendly. Do not miss out this restaurant if you're within the vicinity.Cheers!
4
Food is delicious but pricey. Minimum charge is S$1,000 if you require a room for dining which is costly when you can't even include the corkage charges.
Well, you get what u pay for and the service is good too.

My mum tried their roast duck from a wedding dinner at Pan Pacific Hotel and raved about how soft and delicious it was, so I decided to treat her to the dim sum buffet for her birthday. From the Signature / Specialties section, we tried (1) roast duck and char siew - perfect, tender and delicious. (2) fried cod fish - so light and crispy. Batter was dipped in white sesame seeds which made it quite special (3) Scallop on top of round tofu (1 scallop each of very good size and thickness and delicious). From the ala carte dim sum menu, we had Har Gao (prawn dumpling - may seem like standard item, but the prawns are big and juicy! must try!), chicken tart, scallop dumpling, xiao long bao, taro ball, pumpkin and prawn dumpling, banana and prawn zhu tong (like a spring roll), vegetarian mushroom dumpling and something all coiled with fried vermicelli. All of them were good. We had 2nd helpings of the triangular shaped scallop dumpling. For desserts, each person can choose 2 items out of 4, so we ordered all 4 items to share. The most outstanding item was the mochi which was super soft and coated with fine peanut powder. The price of the dim sum buffet is currently $56++ (tea is $6++ per pax). Credit card promotions do not apply to the dim sum buffet. Pricey compared to other international buffets, but I think worth going for special celebrations.My only grouse is that I indicated in my online reservation that it was a birthday celebration but there was no birthday cake prepared (which the waitress said the restaurant would prepare when there is a birthday celebration). However, our waitress Michelle was so attentive and proactive ! She asked the chef to specially prepare 3 little shou-tao (longevity peach buns filled with lotus paste ) made on the spot and steamed just for us! So delectable and a nice surprise for my mum! Thanks Michelle
5
Today my first day in Singapore I went here for their dim sum buffet for lunch. The quality and taste of the food is excellent. The service we got from Michelle was excellent. This is definitely a good value for the money. Their home made bean curd,fried pork belly, abalone in XO sauce and fresh prawns are really good. This buffet allowed me to taste their entrees that would command a higher price a la carte. If ever I will come back to Singapore I will definitely come back here again

We had dinner here on a weekday while staying at Pan Pacific hotel. It was pleasant to sit along the corridor overlooking the hotel atrium and watching the bubble lifts go up and down. Restaurant is quiet and elegant. The appetizer trio of deep fried baby squid, silver bait fish and fish skin was very good. We also liked the marinated soya sauce chicken, stewed pork which comes with small deep fried buns to dip in the rich sauce, and the braised mushrooms with white fungus. Prices are high especially for the seafood which we didn't try. The free hei bi hiam (dried shrimps fried with chilli) was so good we kept asking for more. Service is good.
4
Enjoyed a business dinner last night. We ordered a la carte. Hot and sour soup, barbecue meats, abalone, beef with kai lan all good. Shrimp with chilli could have been a bit spicier. I was also encouraged by a local colleague to try the deep fried durian ice cream - and it was actually rather good.Service was pleasant but a bit slow towards the end.Overall good though
3
Its my first visit for lunch and my friend has been staying at Pan Pacific for more than 10years, so he recommended and we decided to try out the chinese food.The service was ok and the service staff was helpful in recommending to us what dishes are popular to give it a try and also getting our special request done. The White Fungus and Mushroom Chicken, Asparagus with Dried Chilli, Garoupa with extra spicy sauce and Seafood Fried Rice that we ordered was nice especially the garoupa(the waiting time was abit long, around 20 to 25mins).As we came during lunch hours, the place was abit noisy though its not crowded and also the staff should keep us updated or informed us about the waiting time for the garoupa.Other than that, everything else was good
4
We had my and my son birthday celebration there on 5th Dec 2105 , was served by Ms Apple and Mie Ying, Both were simply outstanding in customer service and friendliness . Food were delicious and complemented by great service by the 2 ladies. Thank yo
5
Was here for dinner party. Manager was very helpful n adjusted our menu upon request. The dishes were all great including Abalone with Pan-fried Foie Gras in Abalone Sauce. Yummy.
Wines were great too. The ambient the feel were great.
Will come back for more.
5
Enjoyed a lovely romantic dinner which had great service and exquisite food. Definitely one of my best meals in Singapore.
3
After they moved from the high floor to the low floor, this restaurant has no views at all.
Food is above average for all the dim sum I tried.
Service is average.
5
Great selection, amazing taste, good service! Ordered so many different types of dimsum plus meats and noodles, was superfull but couldn't stop eating...!
3
We booked this place for dinner because the set menus appeared inviting. However, we were disappointed with the quality of the food, which was lukewarm/sometimes cold and the taste of the food was lacking in fine quality. There was lots of sauce to mask the actual taste of the food. I have tasted better food in this restaurant.Cost was exorbitant. Be careful if you prebook the set menu. If you do not fulfill the actual number of people, you will be charged even for the number of people who do not show up. Understand that the restuarant's stand is that they have already prepared the food so they have to charge, so do be careful.You only get 2 carpark coupons per table of 10. But on the plus side, the service staff were exemplary
3
Had thought this would be a great place to enjoy some Chinese food especially given the high reviews, ratings. However, was quite disappointed.The Good:1. A big menu with a wide variety of dishes available, including the standard stir-frys and dishes you find everywhere but some interesting ones too.2. Lovely entrance and waiting area with plush couches etc, unlike any other place I have seen.3. Food quality is good.The Not so good:1. Service was pretty average. For the most part, the staff was busy with their work and barely looked up to see how frantically we were trying to get their attention so that we could order our food or make changes to our order. 2. The food arrived rather late (20 minutes' wait) even when we were the last customers to arrive and there were only 2 other couples around who were already eating their food. 3. The food arrived lukewarm to almost cold, and this is one thing that annoys me the most in any restaurant. We had to send it back to be re-heated.4. The seating arrangement is a bit too compact and one feels pretty closed in, given that there are no windows or views.5. Overall, seemed pretty expensive for the unsatisfactory experience we had
5
We have a family lunch on Weekend to celebrate mom's and niece's birthday. Everyone enjoyed the food..mini Buddha over the wall, dim sum were excellent, including char siew pau, poached prawns were fresh and sweet, steamed fish was excellent, fried rice with crabmeat and Sakura ebi was flavorful, lobster & fruit salad was refreshing. We had double portion of dessert. We started it light with aloe Vera jelly, assorted butter cakes and back glutinous rice with red bean dessert. Thereafter we ordered avocado cream with coconut ice for the kids, deep friend durian ice cream for the adults and a birdsnest in almond cream for our parents. Overall we had a great time, a fantastic meal and received great service through our meal.
5
The only dim sums we always have is at Hai Tien Lo. Not only good atmosphere but very friendly and excellent services. Throughout the years we have been there, nothing have change. Certainly i would like to praise these people for their excellent servicse especially Apple, Yen Ling. My family have always spent a wonderful time there. Last but not least, we hope there have more variety of dim sums
4
One of the top Chinese restaurants in town, this restaurant places a lot of emphasis on the overall presentation of their food. Guests will be impressed by its overall look and good service but I found their dim sum more enjoyable than the other dishes which did not leave an impression. I also like the place and the view better before their renovation
4
We book an appointment over the phone for lunch buffet. Receptionist very friendly. Once we come to the restaurant, we've immediately ushered to our table.Enjoy our buffet lunch. Budha jump soup taste very nice and my other favourite is the wasabi prawn ball. My son love their seafood noodle and my husband love their bbq meat and bbq pork bun.Staff very friendly and efficient
5
Great Service and excellent food delivered with a smile. The waitress will advise if she feels you have over ordered
5
Certainly the best Chinese restaurant wher I was. Very good and professional service. The food was various and excellent with a reasonable price. Thank you for the good dinner
5
This is probably one of the best Chinese restaurant I ever been..
The soup with scallops was excellent.. The fish steamed with soya sauce was also very good... I loved the chicken with ginger green sauce as well. Well, I do not have any criticism...
5
We had a wonderful Chinese cuisine at Hai Tien Lo, Pan Pacific Hotel Singapore. The dishes included roasted meats that were succulent with perfect crispy skin, suckling piglets roasted to perfection, Steamed Soon Hock fish that was fresh and tasty and lovely Peking Duck. Our whole family of 3 tables had a very satisfying dinner. Kudos to the chefs and the smiley and attentive service staffs for a memorable evening
4
We tried Hai Tien Lo with much expectation based on the very favorable reviews on trip advisor. We ordered the suckling pig appetizer, which was delectable and perfectly done; roast duck, which was good but not great; szechuan prawns with green beans and fried shallots, which was also good but not heavenly; and the braised pork which was fork-tender and juicy. Overall it was a good dinner, but i wouldn't say it was great or memorable. I expected to be wowed, but it was just okay. Satisfying but not mind-blowing. Maybe i expected too much based on the high rating.
5
Hai Tien Lo has always been my favourite Chinese restaurant where my family have been patronising for years, the food is great, the service is always memorable, we are always been well taken care of especially during our special occasions and the restaurant became a second home to us, I would recommend this restaurant to all my family and friend
4
We had dinner with friends. I was very impressed with the food. The beef dish was amazing. It was so tender and melt in the mouth. The other dishes were just as good. Usually I would rarely eat fried rice because it would mostly be blah but I am glad I tried it here. It was one of the best fried rice I have ever had. I would definitely make a return trip to this restaurant again
5
This is a expensive Chinese restaurant in pan pacific hotel. It's located at the top floor and have a 360 Deg view of the city. The food is good. We went for lunch and order some dim sum, Peking duck and soup. Price is slightly in the high side but it's ok
5
One of the best Chinese meals we have ever had in this beautiful restaurant in the Pan Pacific.The starters of spring rolls and crispy fish skin with salt and pepper whitebait were terrific.The mains of prawns in lemon butter sauce and the beef in garlic were just as good.Wonderful
4
The last time I dined at HTL was almost 15years ago! Lost it in my radar of Chinese restaurants for past decade. Decided on trying it after reading about its special seafood yusheng. Almost cancelled reservation last minute when a guest told me how horrible the food was at a recent company lunch. I was glad I decided to give this place a chance! The food was given thumbs up by everybody. Service was very good and price though not cheap I think its much more value for money compared to other similar class restaurants. Only negative point? Its lost its panaromic view at the 37th floor. There's no view to talk about now. Still will definitely recommend & return
5
We had dim sum there , a great choice , the staff werwe polite and efficient , the prices were reasonable but the food was authentic , reccomended .
4
Highly recommend this place for special occasions. Have organised many family birthdays as well as business meetings here. Food, ambiance and service here is 5-stars. Don't forget to try the dim sums.
5
The food was good, the staff and service were even better. We enjoyed a 5 or 6 course dinner (lost count). With so many course, it was quite filling.
5
Great attentive service. You can even arrange for a birthday cake via Pacific marketplace to be delivered at dinner.
5
Superb choice of food.
Dim Sums ...!
... and the sweets ... - lunch was just great!
Waiters were quick and very friendly.
4
First the food quality and taste is great but I am aware there r similar with less cost. Imperial kitchen ion is great, perhaps a bit less in quality but great. Hai tien and lo is worth a visit regardless, if your pocket allows
5
This is my third visit to Hai Tien Lo for a buffet lunch. The spread was very wide as usual. Service was excellent, Jenna was rather attentive and pleasant. However, the fried rice could be more fragrant - maybe use the in-house signature XO Sauce? For the udon with pork slices, the meat was quite tough and difficult to chew - perhaps the meat could be tenderized first? Other than these, the rest of the food was very tasty and delightful
3
I read great reviews on this restaurant so we booked a table for four last week for the a la carte lunch buffet. The food was so-so, they have changed the menu, there was no bird's nest egg tart and no foie gras yam puff. (this was advertised in their website).Even the dessert I had, did not leave any sweet memories, the sesame paste was diluted and too sweet. The only best thing was the service, waitresses very attentive and friendly.We spend almost $300 for a table of four. I can get better deal elsewhere
4
Tried their Golden Hues of Decadence menu and we were impressed!Steamed Minced Pork Dumplings with Hairy Crab Meat and Roe….. A twist from the usual Xiao Long Bao. Steamed Whole Hairy Crab with Perilla Leaves…..Everyone had one each and nobody was disappointed! 2 waitress patiently removed the crab shells and extracted the prized crab roe and crab meat out from the medium-large mitten crabs.Steamed Hairy Crab Meat and Crab Roe with Alaska Crab Claw and Egg White…..Tasted like silk. Extremely smooth, felt like a pudding.Bamboo Clams…..One of the best bamboo clams we had eaten. Tender clams, cooked just nice and very very tasty!Braised Bean Curd with Pine Mushrooms, Hairy Crab Meat and Crab Roe…..Tofu was delicious.Stewed Inanwa Udon with Wild Mushrooms, Crab Meat and Crab Roe……A twist of the common Singapore seafood horfun. Can skip.Stewed Fresh Shrimps with Crab Meat, Crab Roe and Maltose……If there was one dish we would not order again, this would be it. Nothing particularly special.Date: 18 Oct 201

It has been awhile since I visited Hai Tien Lo and the experience reminded me of why I have always had a good impression of the restaurant. Ours was a business lunch for a mere 22 people !! and it was in 8 courses. Firstly I was rather impressed by the pace of food – fast enough to stroll though lunch without getting back late (or at least not too late) but slow enough to avoid indigestion. Secondly I have almost been fascinated by food with fusion accents. Hai Tien Lo’s is basically very good Cantonese food with a twist. For example the braised abalone (wonderfully elastic) in its own brown sauce enriched (and I am mean rich) with foie gras. Or that extra smooth soya bean paired against salty richness of crab cut through with a touch of bitterness from the egg-plant done Greek style. Or the incredible well cooked sautéed scallops, mushroom and a rather remarkable home made XO sauce. Or finely sliced beef in suki-yaki style with a slap in the face pickled cabbage (kimchi without the burn your mouth garlic and chili). Thirdly, the ambiance is very good for a business lunch. Sumptuous enough to say ‘I care’ without being an over the top statement of ‘I charge too much’. Well done
4
I went here with my family to celebrate my cousin bday.
The food is okay, but in the end they gave us chocolate cake. Whoa..the cake is super...there is praline in the cake..and cant describe it..go there and try it yourselves
5
We had a set dinner. Food enjoyed refined Cantonese style food and excellent service. The staff was very friendly to our young children as well. We are sure to return soon.
4
Great staff, fantastic menu. In a city renowned for its food, it was wonderful to find this gem right in our hotel.
5
In the amazing Ruby room, with a giant round table for 20 or more, my colleagues and i shared a fantastic meal, specially selected for our evening. Every dish was delicate, interesting, but substantial enough that you got your fill. The private rooms are well sized and give the meal a sense of exclusivity over the restaurant tables. Highly recommended for large business dinners and family events.
4
I went to meet a colleague here for lunch and although the menu is a little pricey, it was 100% worth it! We both went for the Dim Sum buffet and were absolutely spoilt for choice. I absolutely adored the Braised Wagyu Beef Calf with Pan-fried Yeast Rice accompanied with Marinated Beef Shank, as well as my pudding, Chilled Cream of Mango Sago and Pomelo. It was all so good, I wanted to stay and carry on eating rather than go back to work! Could be a good place for business meals as formal enough and well-located
5
Singapore is full of restaurants so choosing one can be a bit hit and miss. Hai Tien Lo was in our hotel so it was really convenient. The welcome was really friendly and while we waited for our table we reviewed the extensive and mouth-watering menu. The diversity of dishes was terrific and many were new to us. Service was a little patchy and confused but the food was terrific with fabulous flavour. We would have been further rewarded perhaps had our choices been more adventurous as it was we had a fabulous meal with a good New Zealand wine served at a perfect temperature but in curiously small measures. We came for the food and it didn't disappoint
5
Weekend Dimsum Buffet is excellent! Starting off dare I say, the best dim sum buffet I have been to thus far, is one of the Chef's Signature dishes, the Mini "Buddha Jumps over the Wall". The double-boiled soup was rich in flavour and contained many premium ingredients within. Do note that it is only a single serving per person for this dish! Full Review here: http://www.theshutterwhale.com/blog/2014/7/11/weekend-dim-sum-buffet-hai-tien-l
1
We were exhausted from our flight and wanted a quick easy meal. The Chinese food was very disappointing and the waitresses couldn't really speak English that well + they appeared to not really care about serving us. Don't bother eating here, try the Suntec City food court which you can walk to from the Pan Pacific Hotel
5
Great food, quality ingredients good service. Too bad, some of the dishes can only order once. The fish maw & sliced abalone soup was loaded with fish maw & sliced abalone. You get a whole piece of small abalone in the meat pau. Dessert was limited to only 3 choices, we tried 2 and both was excellent. As it was an ala carte buffet, the quality was not lacking nor where the ingredients used. Would I return? most definitely if I am back in Singapore again
5
Been here numerous times and was never disappointed! Food is great as ever. Teresa was very attentive to our needs and constantly brings on the most beautiful smile
5
Highly recommend for it's food and service. Went and had lunch buffet and you will be spoilt for choice! You can order anything on the menu and everything is made fresh and tasty!Staff was very attentive towards us. The Abalone dish was great! Dim Sum was made fresh and hot. And the Mini Buddha Jumps Over Wall Soup was Excellent!!!!Would highly recommended and will visit this restaurant agai
3
Sorry Pan Pacific, I loved everything else about the hotel except our experience here. Not having a great knowledge of the food we selected a set menu for nearly 400 dollars for three of us and expected fine dining but unfortunately we were disappointed. We fine dine a lot in London but maybe our English palates did not respond well to the different cuisine. The starter of fried fois gras was very nice, the winter melon soup acceptable, didn't enjoy the next course with abalone, the main was just based on rice and rather bland and the mango sago pudding, although refreshing, was very average. On the plus side the decor is good and the service staff pleasant
5
This is the chinese restaurant which is given the warm services and hot delicious food. Peking duck is the one of the food that i like it. The skin is very crispy and you can choose to make the duck meat to the fried rice which is cooking by their homemade xo sauce. Besides that, I am strongly recommend the Australlia 2 head abalone with oyster sauce and the local lobster with lemon butter sauce which strongly recommended by restaurant server and it is really not disappointed to me.The abalone and lobster are very tasty,fresh and delicious which is never tried at other restaurant before .Services are also the top. They are very attentive that introduce each of food when they are serving to us. I feel like a VIP because they will concern about the sequence of serving the food.They help us to arrange the sequence of food and always give us the warm concern during the "trip" of the food coming.Definately a best restaurant and sure will come back soon
5
Went with friends on a Sunday for this Weekend Dim sum buffet. Absolutely value for money. We ordered a total of 18 dishes and 2 desserts. There are many dishes for you to choose, but some are limited to one time order. Your food serving is according to the number of pax, so you don't waste it and can still order many other varieties. Service is excellent, food is good. I will go back again. At $68++http://www.panpacific.com/content/dam/pp/PP%20Singapore/resources/dining/hai-tien-lo/Hai%20Tien%20Lo%20Weekend%20Dim%20Sum%20Buffet%20Menu.pd

Had lunch here with a work colleague and it was a cut above the rest of tim sum restaurants in Singapore. It was quiet and intimate which allowed us to discuss business matters without being worried about who else was listening. The service was attentive without being pushy, and the food quality was excellent. I am an Australian Chinese so maybe i enjoyed the ambience and service more than some Asians care for, but the complete experience was excellent. I'll certainly be back and would consider staying at the Pan Pacific just to get the 25% discount at Hai Tien Lo which is one of the Pan Pacific Hotel restaurants
3
We were looking for a Chinese dinner but this was not what we had in mind. The service was good but the food, ambiance and other patrons were flat out boring. Nothing was memorable. We ate quickly and left. You can find a restaurant like this anywhere, very westernized and cheesy
4
Celebrated Mother's Day in this restaurant. We ordered the set menu, and the food was really good. We are fussy eaters, and being Cantonese, we have very high standards when it comes to Cantonese cuisine. Hai Tien Lo did not disappoint. The food is Cantonese cuisine with a modern twist, for example, our Peking Duck dish was paired with foie gras, The Peking Duck is highly recommended, though Peking Duck is not exactly a Cantonese dish.The service was excellent, knowing it was Mother's Day, they always served our mother first. We thoroughly enjoyed our meal. Price is on the high end though
5
I had dim sum buffet with my wife on 17 April 2014 to celebrate my birthday. The ambience was great although the food could have been better. However, the service was commendable especially if you had been lucky enough to be served by Ms Pei Yin. She demonstrated the true spirit of service quality. She was always smiling, eager and knowledgeable about the menu. Ms Pei Yin indeed made my day! Derek We
5
We went to Hai Tien Lo Restaurant on the 5 April 2014 with 2 tables of 16 adults and 2 children to celebrate my father's birthday and also early birthday celebration for my 4th uncle and auntie which falls in April too.We ordered the Set Menu F for 16pax and a Sakura Fried Rice for the 2 children. The food is delicious and nicely presented especially the Shark fin's soup. It is a dish that is different from the other restaurant which is added with starch. We would said that all the dishes is yummy. The youngest child, my nephew who is 5years old even told the mummy that the fried rice is very delicious which he does not comment any dish before and use the word "VERY".We would like to comment Ms Mabel Chong and Ms Yann Ling for providing excellent service. Both of them are so patient and polite all the way with our special request of this and that.When we requested for our birthday cake to be served, Ms Mabel Chong brought the cake and started the "Happy Birthday" song which surprised and lead us to start to sing too.We shall not hesitate to recommend Hai Tien Lo Pan Pacific to our relatives and friends.WELL DONE
4
I went to Hai Tien Lo with my company for Chinese New Year dinner. The restaurant is well decorated and the service was better than the average Singapore restaurant, loved the tea server with the big teapot pouring tea a few feet from the table into your cup.The food was hao chi and had a very pleasant evening.The view is great but the windows are poorly placed, you can not actually enjoy the view from your seat
5
Beautiful lunch. Food presented well with fabulous flavors as stated in the extensive menu. Waiting staff friendly and efficient esp our waitress Mabel Chong. Altogether a great experience.
5
Service and food well above average. They even offered to make a dish which was not listed on the menu when we inquired about it.
3
Not much to say really, food was quite bland.. not many sides to accompany meat or fish. Very average but would have probably been much better options to order separate meals from al e carte menu instead.As an example one of the mains in tasting menu Beef meal comes without anything on the side. You get a plate of well done thin cut of beef folded on the plate which you share between 2 and there isnt a single thing to accompany it. Service bit theatrical with hand/arm moves that makes you smile. Dont get me wrong ive been in loads of restaurants but even best ones dont have such theatrical behaviour:)

For more reviews, visit my site at ms-skinnyfatThe special weekday a la carte dim sum lunch menu is created by new Dim Sum Chef Lee Siaw Cheen and diners get to feast on an extensive selection of 35 soups, signature dishes, dim sum and desserts at $48.There are 4 new enhanced signature dim sum creations which include Deep-fried Yam Puff with Foie Gras, Baked Egg Tart with Imperial Swiflet’s Nest and White Fungus, Steamed Berkshire Pork “Char Siu” Buns and Crispy Carrot Cake with Hai Tien Lo’s Signature XO Sauce. These are limited to one serving each per guest.Of the lot, the Berkshire Pork “Char Siu” Buns was absolutely heavenly. Juicy and succulent meat in a delicious barbecue sauce lovingly wrapped by a fluffy sweet bun. But why only 1 serving?? :( I also liked the carrot cake which has nice chunks of radish and chinese sausage. This is best paired with the spicy XO sauce.Diners also get unlimited servings of the classic dim sum. The Wok-seared Spinach Dumplings may look really green on the outside but it's also packed with juicy minced pork inside. Delicious!First time trying the Deep-fried Pork Dumpling “Ham Shui Gok”. It's really crispy on the outside and it remained so after 5 minutes of photo taking. It looks really plain but once you bite into it, you'd be surprised by the flavors.The skin has a mochi-like texture and it is filled with juicy pork with mushrooms. When eaten all at once, it tastes like a Hakka Abacus Seed 算盘子.Another delicious pork filled dish but flavored with five spices and wrapped in bean gluten. This is like a baby ngoh hiang but crispier and juicier.If dimsum alone doesn't fill you up, there are also 9 Hai Tien Lo Signatures to pick from which includes hearty dishes like Szechuan Spicy chicken, Grouper fish fillet and Cantonese Sweet and Sour Spare Ribs.. Each table is limited to one serving of any three items.The Homemade Bean Curd with Crab Meat and Eggplant in Supreme Stock comes highly recommended. Absolutely silky and fragrant tofu in a carrot, radish and chicken supreme stock. Slurps!If you like something fried (who doesn't), the Deep-fried Soft Shell Crab with Pepper Sauce is rather delightful. Just work it off later really.What is a Cantonese meal without soup right? Pick from either the Traditional Double-Boiled Soup or the Lobster with Shredded Abalone and Vegetables in Thick Broth (one serving of any one item per person). The little green puffs are made of vegetables. Now you can drink your greens too!For desserts, i went with the Double-boiled Osmanthus Tea with Pear and White Fungus which is light and refreshing. I liked that it's not too sweet.The Mango Sago with Pomelo was a hot favorite. This drinks like a mango smoothie and is surprisingly light as well. If there's more space in your dessert tummy, you could go with the Black Sesame Paste with Glutinous Rice Dumpling.So here you go, Hai Tien Lo's Weekday Dim Sum Buffet. It's perfect for business lunches and definitely for times when you simply just need to treat yourself
5
Restaurant week dinner was well worth it. Great tasting menu. Impeccable service by Mabel. She made sure our tea was refilled and even recommended us the ala carte lunch buffet. Will visit again

So I bring my date there to celebration her 21st birthday as she have always wanna try their food there. Spend a total of $4++ close to $500 as we order abalone, shark fin, lobster and so... Chatted with the staff there and they're all so friendly. Gave 2 of the waitress (Apple & Michelle) there tips but instead of putting in the pocket they actually went to put in the share box as they said they all are a family. Great job to the team. Will be back again.Keep it up People

Appears to cater to groups of well-heeled diners. The fixed price menu start at 108SGD pp and rises steeply from there. Ordering from the a la carte menu is also expensive, and confusing (we had difficulty understanding explanations from the two people serving our table as neither was fluent in English, which is unusual for Singapore). Ended up paying far too much for two mediocre dishes

Me and my friend have made a reservation at Hai Tien Lo Restaurant on 21 January 2014 for a pre CNY gathering and when we were arrive, we was greet by a smile and a warm welcome by the service staff. As we proceed to our table, we was greet by more smile of the service staff and the atmosphere include the ambiance was nice which is really make a pleasant dining experience. As we are seated, we being showed what we are order for the Chinese New Year Menu which is the Abundance Menu. As we having our dinner course through the night, the service staffs were very attentive especially Michelle who serve our table and as well Zac approach our table by asking how is our dining experience, who I believe was the restaurant manager. The Menu we had was excellent and well done to the Kitchen Team. Indeed it was a very special night to me and my friends, what make it even more special was the Zac, Michelle and the service team who make our dining experience a memorable one and not forgetting the food was excellent as well. It is really befitting the Slogan that Pan Pacific Hotel carry, Creating A Memorable Experience.Thank you very much and Happy Chinese New Year.Cheers,OD

The service is good as the staff were very cheerful. Ambience was great too! My favourite dish for the buffet was the 'Buddha Jumps Over The Wall' Soup. I absolutely love all the soups here as they are very authentic. For a good experience of the wide variety of food here, more people should come so that you will not feel so full. The 'Dim Sum' was a little bit disappointing as the 'Ha Gao' was not as good as before, where a bigger prawn was served. I heard that the chef in-charge changed after my previous visit. The menu was amended also. Some of the dishes that I wanted was not there. Not recommended to take the fish in the buffet as the fish used was not of high standards of what it is expected of such a restaurant

Hai Tien Lo use to be a great place for entertaining, or simply having a nice relaxing meal of high quality and impeccable service. At that time it was on the 37/F and also had great ambiance. It has now moved to the 3/F (since around Feb 2013) and deteriorated into what could only graciously described as well past it’s prime. The food quality is mediocre at best, with many of the dishes delivered half warm, as if they sat in the kitchen for 20 minutes or so before being delivered. That is possible because the service was exceptionally slow, although it was not very crowded (noontime Sunday). The service staff were pleasant enough, but clearly lacked training and were, well, a bit awkward. Not the end of the world on that problem but at ~ $ 100 per person, one expects a bit more. As others have described, The new 3rd floor ambiance is so-so at best, and a major downgrade compared to the previous 37/F layout. This will definitely be our last visit to Hai Tien Lo, which is a bit sad, because we have been going there for many, many years. But, Singapore moves on, and there are far better places with much higher quality, service standards, and management, than at this aging place well past it’s prime

Our waiter(Alan), was a real star! - Spoke great English and really helped with recommendations for our meal. Not the cheapest Chinese meal you may ever have, but that is Singapore for you!
5
Very nice dim sum served with unique presentation. Served by the assistant manager named Michelle Siao, who was very attentive and friendly, recommended food which was really nice. Will definitely be back again, highly recommended!
5
Luv the great food served by Hai Tien Lo. Managed to see humble Executive Chef Lai who happened to be around. Excellent service served by staff Apple & Alan. Will definately be back for food. Highly recommended for diners.

I recently stepped into this place that I've heard so much about... even before my arrival in Singapore. We went there at 3:00pm in the afternoon, a time when a restaurant usually is not so busy, however not this one... all tables were taken, so make sure you have a reservation.We were greeted warmly and as we were seated promted didn't need to take advantage of the manicure, the kid's corner or the beverages and fruits that are offered to waiting customers.The decoration is modern held in traditional red and white colors. The tables, not especially large if you order a lot, but far enough apart to have some privacy, despite being a popular restaurant with many children around.The food was fresh with many choices - to highlight of course is the showmanship of the chef who was pulling our noodle order tableside. Not to forget to highlight the condiment station where you can mix your own dipping sauces as well as fresh fruits and nuts to gobble up.The service was attentive, friendly and honestly, I never had a restaurant offering me as many new warm handtowels in my life - a nice touch.Was it expensive? It was money well spent!Will I go back? Of course

We were there to have the winter solstice family dinner celebration meal and we were impressed by the quality of food and impeccable service. In particular, the dessert hashima in almond cream was memorable. The service staff were attentive and once, when the serving spoon unfortunately slipped into the vegetable dish in superior broth, one staff member discreetly handed us another new spoon. Also, without prompting, the service staff kindly asked if we needed parking coupon, and whether we needed to pack the leftover food. Thank you Mable, Alan and Apple for the excellent service. We will definitely return for another meal in future

My friends treated me to Hai Tien Lo and thankful for the great experience. Consistently fine quality food in the all dishes we had. My favorites were the started with the fabulous dish <toss of Yu-Sheng>, <Lotus Leaf Glutinous Rice> and GOOD ending with the amazing dessert of Deep-fried durian Ice-cream. The foods were well-executed using traditional cooking techniques, with a slightly modern twist. Amazing presentation!!!Besides the marvelous foods, we managed to see the humble Executive Chef Lai who happened to be around and making us feel precious. Staffs were consummate professionals. Especially thanks to the Restaurant Manager Mr. Zhu and the Assistant Manager of Ms. Michelle Siao who had rendered a hospitality and attentive service. And also special thanks to Ms. Leow Lee Mee who had offered a patiently and promptly service on our special requested of changing few differences varieties of desserts ordered. Good food, genuinely personal service and a modern stylish ambience. Highly Recommended for Diners. Keep up the good work
5
Thank you Zac, the manager for the excellent service & Michelle Siao for the hospitality. The ambience of the restaurant is wonderful. Thank you Chef Lai for delicious food espeically the yusheng. We will highly recommend to our friends and family. Therefore, we will come back again.
5
Together with my friend dining in Hai Tien Lo restaurant at Pan Pacific Singopre, we had enjoy a good dining experience, good food prepare by Exec Chef LAI and good service provided by Zac Zhu, Michelle Siao, Angel, Mabel and Yann ling, Thank you very much. I will come back again
5
My wife and I went for lunch at Hai Tien Lo today, without any recommendation.We were made to feel most welcome and were served by a delightful girl, TERESA.She and two of her colleagues offered excellent advice on our request for vegetarian food.Teresa was not sure about a dish that we asked her about and she promptly excused herself and brought in her supervisor, who was also most helpful.The food was served very gracefully and the plates were cleared most professionally without the clatter of piling one empty dish on top of another.The food items we ordered were excellent.We will definitely use the restaurant again and hopefully will continue to get the very polite and friendly service and good food
5
I visited Hai Tien Lo for Dim Sum in Pan Pacific hotel. The food was first class and service is excellent. Dim sum is amazing made so delicate and beautiful. We went there for friend bithday, at end the manager Michelle Siao and staff sing happy birthday song for my friend and give us bithday cake surprise! We are so pleased for food and service. Summarising the entire experience, the quality of the dim sum, the freshness of ingredients and the ambience really impressed me
3
Unique decoration. Helpful and friendly staff. Environment a bit noisy. Food OK but not exceptional.
4
Located at top of the Pan Pac, serves very nicely done chinese cuisine. The view is awesome except the layout is round so walking around is a little confusing. Prices aren't sky-high (pun intended) and can let you taste real exquisite stuff
4
Had lunch at Hai Tien Lo while staying in Pan Pacific Singapore. Food was great; service was excellent. Love the XO scallop much!
4
The menu has some unusual dishes, which were very tasty. The dim sum was also very good. The service was excellent.
5
This is part of the Pan Pacific Singapore hotel and the famous Chinese restaurant Came here before for few times and went back for another round of Buffet A la Carte Dim Sum Lunch Fabulous design and seatings. Extremely comfortable chair and well blend into the atrium design.Welcome by pretty hostess with great smile as always and seated on a round table... Full setting....Overlooking atrium bar and across edge restaurant ... Love the quiet music and warm services Was served by asssistant manager Apple with a pot of Osmanthus Oolong, ( perfect for the lunch as we ate a lot, this would help digestion) She also went extra by explaining their signature dishes to us... Elize and Teresa were serving us and we don't even have a chance to pour own tea (they are too good at service) Thousands of appreciation to make us like kings and queen!!Ordered tons of great food and soup ( typically we clean up each dishes as they were too delicious!!! ) It's like a spa treatment of Chinese cuisine, from soup, appetizers, caviar dim sum, to wok fried firefly hot dishes, sweet lovely Tong Shui... By far the best weekend dim sum lunch I had, and all the dishes were featured during normal dining hours So we could visit any time other than weekend... With the price paid, definitely worth it... But make sure u make reservation. As Hai Tien Lo always packed but yet maintain highest quality of food and service...
5
I have always enjoyed the food here and particularly like the modern interpretations of the traditional food (the scallops were my favourite). I don’t usually go for “presentation” food but here they have defiantly got it right with the perfect balance of quality and quantity along with fantastic flavours
4
Regular traveller to Singapore.First time to Hai Tien Lo after a refurbishment at Pan Pac and a relocation of the restaurant to the 3rd floor. We ordered dim sum for weekday lunchtime.Attentive professional service, dim sum quality was excellent, even creative with some dishes such as the ham sui gok (pork and vegetable fried dumplings)Great selection of dishes but there was no dan tart (egg custard tart) to finish of the meal so felt somewhat incomplete.Nice touches with individual sauce condiments trays and tea warmer.We'll be back!
4
Priced at &68++, diners will get a bowl of Buhdda Jump over the wall herbal soup filed with shark fins, abalone, sea cucumber and other seafood and herbs. A choice of one serving of a few dishes. I choose the steam promfret. The promfret was fresh and the spicy sauce was not too hot. Some dishes I like are: poached fresh prawns, sweet and sour pork, stew beef, tendon in herbs and fish slice soup in shark's bone. The menu is alot lesser than before they shifted to level 3. Still worth it if you go in big group
5
I like the ambience. The layout of the restaurant added exclusivity to diners and I appreciate that as I have 7 kids at my table. The service was fantastic, from making reservation over the phone to the dining experience. These guys really have the heart to serve. Thank you, Minnie, Zhi Hao & Bonnie! Oh yes! My kids described the chocolate cakes as a dream come true:
5
Try the Spring rolls, the sauted Prawns and the seafood noodles. The restaurant has been relocated on the 3rd floor of the Pan Pacific, before we were going there for the view as well (it was located on the 37th floor). So at the beginning we were a bit disappointed as the view is on the inside lobby of the hotel, however the food quality is very high and if you wish to eat good chinese food, this is a place that I would strongly suggest. The service is fast and efficient and the girl that was taking care of our table was very friendly and nice
3
Had tim sum and some a la carte dishes. The quality of the food did not live up to our expectations, unlike carlton or shangrila's chinese restaurants, their food os overpriced with the quality you get.
5
Its already my 2nd visit to this restuarant for the high-tea buffet. Great variety of food plus Superb service from the staffs. I can still remember their names, Claire, Angel, Yann Ling & Manager Vincent. Good job guys! Will definately go back again & again....
5
Excellent great services received from Pan Pacific Hai Tien Lo Restaurant staffs. High quality of delicious cantonese dining especially the double boiled soup. Had enjoyed ourselves very much of the nice cozy ambience.
4
This is another Chinese restaurant we love ! We have been there 4 times last year and once last April. Price not cheap and so we cannot afford to go frequently. Nice ambience , nice food
5
Pork dumping was very nice.. excellent service from Ms Corliss and Ms Pei Ying.. I'm so enjoy that having my lunch at here Pan Pacific Hai Tien Lo Restaurant.. thanks for the services..
4
We got the set menu and were treated to a delectable Chinese dinner. Even though it was a ten-course meal, the servings were manageable and we were able to savor the food without feeling bloated by the 7th or 8th course. I just found it a little pricey
5
I must comment on two very excellent lady staff at Hai Tien Lo Singapore, whom have given me a very professional service especially advice on food to order(both are very patience and attentive)I wish to thanks both Ms Angel Kok and Ms. Apple at Hai Tien Lo -Pan Pacific Hotel Singapore for the wonderful experience of feeling important in the restaurant
3
It was a disappointment when I learned that they have moved to a lower floor.But since I was hoping for the food, I gave it a try still.Quite much of a disappointment.. I brought my mum and grandma there but only then did I realized the price.. hahaha.. I heard that the buffet was not amazing, it should be the ala-carte that is worth the price, but I also learned after that. My family has been to much more good and nice restaurant than me and if I can say the food is average, what's more is for them?No view, no good buffet, the only thing that was good is their service.Quite polite and fast, but still if the food is not nice, we are just paying for the service not the food... 300+ slightly a little less than 400, is what we pay for 4 person's buffet, you can probably judge that. Try the ala-carte...Just FYI, the telephone numbers on some websites are incorrect. I called Pan Pacific Hotel to do a transfer
5
I had lunch at Hai Tien Lo 3 times over the past week and find the service exceptionally good. The service staff present during my visit, Ms Yann Ling, Ms Eliza and Ms Ivy were professional and helpful, always attentive to our needs. Food quality was great, my guest and family were full of praises of the entire dining experience. Bravo
3
I had set dinner that cost $74++pp in this restaurant. I find the food standard is average. The entree and soup are both good but the chicken main course taste so salty that I could not eat. I also had yum cha in this restaurant. I don't think there is anything special about the food here.
4
We went to this, Hai Tien Lo, Chinese restaurant while we were on vacation towards the end of the year of 2012.The service and the food was great. Well done.
4
High quality of Chinese food served in this restaurant, and the price for a 5 star fine dinning here is very reasonable. The Executive Chinese Chef came and talk to us making us feel precious. Well done.
4
Just Went there with the whole family from Hong Kong for my day's birthday dinner. It was not cheap, but everything was great from the BBQ to the double-boiled soup to the steam fish. Overall excellent standard and service. Will certainly return.
4
Great menu and good service. It ws well run and had a good variety on the menu and the staff understood the menu and were of great assistance answering questions
3
We have visited Hai Tien Lo 3 times before on the top floor and the food, service and view were absolutely out of this world. We felt privileged to be there. Visited the restaurant for the first time in its new location on the 3d floor in February. Very sad to say that the special ambiance has gone. It's now in a dark corner and I felt quite locked up looking into a dark atrium of the hotel. Food is still good no doubt about it and the service attentive and respectful always. However that special part of going there and dining on top of Singapore has gone. Really a pity. Now its just a good Cantonese restaurant one of many in Singapore
5
It's a pleasure and grateful to choose Hai Tien Lo at Pan Pacific Hotel to have our family lunar new year dinner . Besides the marvellous and delicious foods, the friendly staffs there make us feel homely and comfortable. Especially thanks to Apple, Yann Ling, Zhi Hao and Pei Yin. We all enjoy very much
5
the only restaurant that i could dine in this hotel.. but really amazing.. can't say a lot about food.. coz i wanted to try oriental, although I am nt a oriental food lover.. but still i liked the lobster. Amazing presentation!!! my one night stay in Singapore was nt bad... and Tien Lo owes a credit for that.Thanks for the food and servic
5
The best dinner I've had in Singapore!My husband took me Hai Tien Lo this fall for a celebratory anniversary dinner.I had the best food and the best service. The server Mr.Zhi and Miss Moon (Claire) were so nice to us and we felt very comfortable. I absolutely would visit here once again. Thanks for giving me such a romantic memory
5
It's a pleasure for dining in Hai Tien Lo, Pan Pacific Hotel. Marvellous and delicious food are always being served by the fabulous and friendly staffs. They are namely Apple, Yann Ling, Zhi Hao and Pei Yin. My family always enjoy their service and food are being served promptly. We will definitely choose Hai Tien Lo as our first choice for dining out
5
We had our anniversary dinner at Hai Tien Lo, Pan Pacific Hotel, S'pore last night. Food was super good & staffs were friendly. Most commendable was a staff named Mabel. She made us feel very much welcome & relax. Ambience was cosy & for sure we will visit this restaurant once again
1
last year was on the top floor, giving terrific views and the atmosphere made it a must for both romantic dinners and impressing clients, now it is on 3rd floor, above a noisy hotel lobby
5
After the transformation, Hai Ten Lo has been moved to level 3. Although losing the nice view, but the food and service is sitll excellence, especially the food, i like the noodle so much. Thank you for all the staff and chefs of Hai Tien Lo, you gave me a unforgettable time
3
The food & service in this restaurant are both excellent & if all you want is a good 'Chinese' meal it's first class. However the setting on the 3rd floor, facing inward over the atrium with no outside views & a rather boring decor is disappointing. There are equally fine restaurants in much more pleasant locations in Singapore
1
Now that the Hai Tien Lo is located at the level 3 of the Pan Pacific hotel, dining experience is never the same anymore.Before the renovation of the Pan Pacific hotel recently, the Hai Tien Lo was located at level 37 floor and had a breath taking view overseeing the lovely Singapore skyline. It was one of my favourite restaurants that I used to be so proud of and want to impress my overseas visitors when they visited Singapore. It was a place where the visitors can experienced the fine dining ambience and the beautiful scenery.Now let me share with you my bad dining experience on Wednesday, 28 Nov 2012 at dinner time.Ambience? What Ambience?The restaurant is now located at a crappy corner on the level 3 of the hotel with “an open concept” dining experience with “NO VIEW”!!!. Ok if you insist that there is a view it will be a view overlooking the “Edge which is the coffee house / buffet dining experience restaurant “ located on the same level . And to add on to the noise level, don’t forget the noisy hotel lobby & the Atrium which is the bar area also located on the same ground floor. Noise travels upwards and that it for sure!!!To make things worst, I could also hear the loud toasting noise from the “4 private VIP rooms” over an hour. The guests at the “VIP Rooms” were doing the Singaporean cheers “YUM SENG” non stop or “loud shouting of bottoms up” all night long! My god, if you are trying to look for a quiet dining experience with ambience, there is no way you can experienced it anymore.Service ? What service??? Slow, Slow Slow!!!!The service was slow and terrible. If you want to experience a “world class snail restaurant service” one should come here. I was there alone that night and only ordered 3 dishes. One Bamboo prawn soup, one XO Bean curd and a bowl of plain rice and it took me more than one hour to wait for my dishes. In your opinion is this acceptable? I was being shown to the last table of the restaurant “hiding in a corner” that if I need to look for a waitress I had to wait for them to come. It was so difficult to get attention of them from where I was sitting. I had to keep chasing your waitress to ask them where were my food My soup came in about 20 minutes but I totally lost my appetite by the time my XO tofu and rice came after more than one hour. After taking two mouthful of rice and I had to ask them to pack my food home because I have lost my appetite after drinking so much liquid i.e. the soup and plain warm water because of the long waiting time. When I called for the bill, your waitress finally came and apologies for the bad dining experience and gave me a 10% discount off my bill. But I am not impressed at all. She explained to me that your kitchen was overwhelmed and shorthanded because there of the VIP rooms guests and also the guests outside the dining area. If your waitress has tried to explain to me that you had a busy night and I had to wait a little while longer for my food, I would have patiently waited or perhaps gone to another restaurant instead. Otherwise, the kitchen should increase their staff for the evening to cope with the busy night.I am totally disappointed. The dining experience at Hai Tien Lo is never the same anymore
5
The Hai Tien Lo Restaurant has moved to the 3rd Floor. I was unsure if this was a wise move as the Hai Tien Lo previously located on the 37th Floor has spectacular views of Singapore (now enjoyed by the Pacific Club).My wife and I enjoyed dinner at the Hai Tien Lo on the evening of our wedding anniversary and believe the decision to move the Hai Tien Lo to the 3rd Floor was the right move. Despite missing the views, the atmosphere was more relaxing and the décor, surroundings and service are 1st class and the food is still of the highest standard. We tried their signature dishes (Trio of Treasures, Lobster in Butter Sauce, and Braised Tofu with XO Sauce). The Tofu dish was one of the best tofu dishes ever tried. We will be making a reservation at the Hai Tien Lo whenever in Singapore
5
Travelling for work I always enter hotel restaurants with trepidation but too exhausted to venture further afield. At Hai Tien Lo I was very pleasantly surprised by prices that were good for Singapore standards and food that was absolutely delicious. The King Prawn and Prawn Dumpling was a simple dish with so much subtlety and flavor, and the Ha Tien Lo hand pulled noodles were brilliant
5
I recently visited Hai Tien Lo restaurant,thiugh it had lost its panoramic view at 37th floor, its food standard still maintain as it is. It is now located at the 3th floor opposite buffet EDGE.We ordered the steam bamboo clam with fresh galic and vermicelli. The clam was fresh and its texture was cook to perfection. Another dish that i would like to recommand is the Xiao Bai Cai in shark bone brooth.The soup was clear yet creammy,definitely a must try dish. We were served by the assistant manager Apple Thong. Her service was superb.She would occationally chat with us and understand how was the food, did it suite our taste. If you like to dine in a tranquility enviroment with exquisite chinese cuisine, Hai Tien Lo will be the one
5
We have visited Hai Tien Lo restaurant twice on our current visit to Singapore. What a disappointment that the wonderful panoramic view of Singapore on the top floor has been replaced with a drab balcony on Level 3 overlooking the reception of the Pan Pacific hotel and the kitchens of the nearby buffet restaurant. We spent the first part of the meal lamenting this loss of ambience but then, when the food came, forgave all. The cuisine is superb. The kitchen makes exquisite fare (best in Singapore) and the service is very attentive and the staff are very concerned with the comfort and enjoyment of the customers and very responsive to our special dietary needs - the Three Treasures appetiser is something unique. This is still a very special restaurant but why-oh-why has the management of the Pan Pacific decided to move this gem from its piece-de-resitance glory on the top floor with the panoramic view - to make way for a bar/club we were told!!! We wish the Pan Pacific architect and interior designer had consulted us before making such a bad decision.David

Went to this restaurant after their renovation. Dishes and menu was different from previous. I guess the dining experience was also different. It has transform its menu and dishes more exquisite than before, but the Chinese style restaurant in the previous setup was what I missed. I guess it is part of a different range of customer it's now targeting. Be prepared for the change compared previously. That being said the atmosphere is done us nice and if u have VIPs. The setup is definitely so much better that previously. A class now higher than previous but it's all coming with a price for exclusive
4
we went there for dinner. After the renovation, Hai Tien Lo gave up the level 37 and moved to level3. The previous amazing view was disappeared.  Food is good and atmosphere is nice to host a family get-together. I would definitely gave a five star if it was still based on level 37 with the fantastic views
5
I love my dining experience here and my family lived it.
4
The food is excellent but very pricey. The amazing views make it all worth while. I dined here while watching the fireworks display for National Day which, frankly, made the cuisine hard to remember
5
Pan Pacific Best restaurant! this chinese restaurant is a top notch cantonese food. really good view from the lift to the 38 floor. very nice ambience.
4
Had a lovely meal here last night with friends, first time we have eaten here but will be back
4
We ate at this restaurant during the New Year's celebrations. They had a special menu of holiday foods meant to ensure health, happiness and prosperity in the coming year. The food was delicious, the portions were ample and the service was excellent.
4
Ate here twice while staying at the Pan Pacific Marina...once for Dim Sum (lunch), and once via room service to sample their Char Kway Teow. Excellent, convenient restaurant within the hotel. The dim sum lunch was outstanding, and the Char Kway Teow was quite good...I'm sure there are better places to sample Char Kway Teow in the Gelang district, but this was a nice option as I had just arrived to Singapore for a short trip and the room service was excellent
5
10 years ago I ate jelly fish whilst visiting my daughter in Seoul and have never seen it anywhere since, however it was on the menu here so I ordered it again so my husband could try it. The whole meal was excellent as was the service. Would eat here again
5
Me and my brother wanted to try this restaurant out after hearing from many people saying that it is a really nice place to dine in. It is located at the Pan Pacific hotel on level 37. We got the 5 course set which was really delicious. The quality of the food was good and it tasted great! The view from the restaurant was great, being so high up you can see many parts of singapore from the top.
5
We stayed at the hotel and one evening we went on 37th floor to have dinner. We ordered a starter each and then 2 times one of the main courses. We was adviced by the very observent waiter, that one portion was large and enough for 2 persons. Very fine advice. We couldn't even eat the one portion.Not so expensive as expected, and a wonderful view
3
I and my group of friends had dinner at the restaurant, we had heard alot about the restaurant so we decided to give it a try..the lift was amazing, it was facing the outside.. we can see the entire street when it was going higher.first we were greeted by the friendly hostess who I guess look like a china girl.. felt welcoming as we enter to our seat.we order a few of the signature dishes, the one serving us, should be a supervisor I perhaps, was wearing a black jacket, 1st time I dine in a restaurant when the supervisor actually look like a trainee, she just keep quiet as I and my fren was discussing what to order, no reccomandation? that's a nono for a 5star hotel.the staff did not even ask to order our drink, it was my friend who was asking it before she start taking order.. after ordering the staff walk away and look as us like we were some folk from some villages.. she even accidentally kicked my chair and just walked away? excuse me? I guess the hotel need train more for this lady over here.. I know it's against the rule to write the name up here.. but her name start with a M.....great food, but not the kinda servicewe are expecting.. mayb for take away orders, would be 5 stars for you.
3
They have very good soup and nourishing. View from the restaurant is good especially when you are having a relaxing lunch.
4
A nice restaurant for a special night out the food was well presented and the was a good range of dishes. Soft drinks and wine are expensive. Cheaper to drink beer
4
the place offers a nice view of the marina boulevard area and during special occasions, you can catch the fireworks at eye level too.
food is nice, and the service staff are very attentive.
1
Had lunch here during my stay. Frankly the food in the food court next door is better than here. Over priced too. You paying for the view up here, that's all. And the view is not that great either. I think it is built long ago since the view is facing the old part of Singapore, not the newly built Marina Bay area. You get much better views else where, and better food too for sure
3
It was the second day of Chinese New Year and we didn't have a resevation. They kindly seatd us - though right by the service station. Lots of waiters getting cutlery and napkins from the cabinet directly behind my chair.We asked for help with the menu, but sadly didn't get much. It was not obvious to us which were entrees or starters..... And we didn't know that one needs to order everything separately - so our meal was sparse. I had the Peking duck - which I found out is an appetizer at this restaurant - and my husband had spare ribs. When everything arrived at the table I asked the waitress about some vegetables; she suggested getting some mixed veggies - which were very nice, but they came later. The veggies were a combination of asparagus, broccoli and snap peas. They had lovely flavor.Dessert was fun - being the new year my husband had the traditional rice cakes but I had coffee ice cream in an avocado cream sauce. (The waiter said it was one of his favorite desserts.)We ordered a bottle of Australian Pinot Noir.Overall, the food was flavorful and the views really beautiful, but our experience was diminished by our lack of knowledge in the restaurant. It would have been nice to have had a little guidance...
5
Excellent chinese restaurant, on the top floor of the Pan pacific Hotel. It is worth a visit because the views are super nice, and the food is delicious. I'd reccomend to go when they have the "east-as-mcuh-as-you-can" buffet because it will allow you to taste many different dishes, all of them excellent. Personnel is kind and attentive. Prices are reasonable for what you get
3
You take a glass elevator to the 37th floor and it's a good entrance to the restaurant. Most tables have also window views so they are obviously milking this aspect. Rated as 1 of the better chinese restaurants in the local blogs, I'm surprised to find it rated so poorly. But after my meal, i think i understand why it's average, like between the sea (Hai) and the sky (Tian). We ordered 1 of the set menus and a bottle of red from their limited wine selection. Luckily they had a chateauneuf-du-pape which is always 1 of my go-to wines. We had a soft shell crab and prawn (with wasabi) starter. This is so 2002, they should change it already. Then we had the sharks fin soup, which appears in most of their sets, which i'm quite disaapointed about, because eating that is also so 2002. The beef main was average, i couldn't tell if it was a chinese or western preparation. The mango dessert is also too normal to elicit any wows. All in all, the standard conclusion - great view, average food. No wonder it's languishing at >#100 here. And the local blogs are not that accurate after al

Date of visit: Saturday 17th December 2011Weekend Brunch is served from 11.30 to 2.30 on Saturday and Sunday.Nice view from the 37th floor, but to me a restaurant is always about the food. In this case it didn't disappoint. Really tasty fare. I wish I could have tried everything.I wanted to make a reservation for the following day, but they were fully booked. So it might be worth reserving in advance of your stay.Â£80 for a couple eating all they wanted in a top Singaporean Chinese restaurant (including tea and coffee) and the toddlers ate free. An absolute bargaiin

The food here is top notch and while a pit pricy not too bad considering the incredible view from the 37th floor.The service was chaotic. The waiter did not know what a bloody mary was even though it was on the cocktails menu. The food came at different times with the vegetables being served well after the staggered main course service with my mains being served nearly 10 mins after my colleague received hers

Been there 3-4 times and my last visit was in October for a business lunch. I must compliment the delicious authentic Cantonese dishes delivered by the chefs of the restaurant. However it was disappointing during my last occasion with the service I encountered. The service staff mi.. taking charge of our table did not seem to be attentive and interested when I requested to order more food and seems unsure when I asked for some recommendation. Later one or two of our orders were again forgotten and need to be reminded. I should say it would only be a wonderful dining experience if staff service can be improved to match the standard of a five star hotel and reputation of the restaurant

Global Kitchen has possibly the most comprehensive breakfast buffet that I've experienced. You name it, it's there. Fresh, in ample supply, and served by incredibly helpful staff. A great breakfast option!

Hai Tien Lo gave me a memorable experience. When I had lunch at Hai Tien Lo, I enjoy a good view, the view is amazing. The food is very delicious and the srvice is excellent.

Elegant place with very supportive staff. The food tastes delicious. Nice tea with variety of flavors.

We have organised recently a private corporate function for 3 tables of VIPs and guests over lunch. Apart from the excellent Cantonese cuisine, we were left impressed by the impeccable service from Apple, Corliss, Zhihao, as well as the flexible pre-event arrangements extended from Christine/Michelle. The hotel's concierge team led by Jennifer, were also proactive and lent us great assistance in receiving the VIPs when the sky turned against us earlier. No doubt, our guests left with an enjoyable lunch and visual treat of the Marina Bay skyline..definitely top class and worthwhile returning

I booked this restaurant months in advance as a special end to our holiday- even liaising with the General Manager of the hotel via tripadvisor as there had been some negative reviews. Despite his assurances we did not have a great meal. We ordered the mixed starter which was just OK at best, the prawn was nice but the duck was horrible, a cold slab of meat. We wanted the suckling pig for main with beef noodles - the waiter said he recommended the mixed BBQ meats which included suckling pig. True it did but just a tiny amount the rest was chicken - nice and moist but luke warm and a BBQ pork thing which I thought was tasteless. When they delivered the meat platter they said that the noodles would be another 5 minutes - this was not acceptable and we told them we wanted them together as it was all part of the main meal. The waiter took the BBQ meats and basically left them in the kiitchen until the noodles arrived. For what you pay here the service and food are not worth it - it's a shame as the hotel is lovely. This restaurant relies solely on the views to pull the customers in. I would not recommend it

I was there with the family last saturday for Dim Sum buffet lunch. The price is reasonable and apart from Dim Sum, they have superb roasted duck and pork as well as seafood on the menu as well. Staffs are very nice, polite and very helpful. We will definitely go back

Having ate all over the world at some of the top places this shocked us.The place was not full on a saturday night.The people that were there were scruffy with loads of children.Definately not a place for a romantic evening or great service.The waiter seemed uninterested in us and failed to offer the jugs of water the other tables had.Also no fresh cutlery to use with the main course.No atmosphere,average food and even had to ask for the bill.You just could not make this up at 163 dollars for two

Had a reasonable meal on our first night in Singapore. The food was good, although "hot" food came tepid. The layout means you feel you are sitting in a corridor although the view is pretty nice. Service was fine ad overall the experience was slightly better than average

We have tested the Sunday BrunchIf you have children, this is definetely the brunch for you. They are really organized to welcome and take care of your offsprings. If, like us, you do not have children, avoid easterm, christmas and other period of the year where kids are the star of the day.If you have kids, I really recommend this one. The staff really take good care of your begotten ones. They advertise, for Champagne, Veuve Cliquot but they served some other brand (I cannot remember clearly but I think it was Mumm). Anyway, the Champagne was ok, but I did not appreciate that it was different from what was advertised.The food is of good quality and you will find a range of products which will satisfy almost all.The service is really good and professional. I was surprised when going to pay that the woman behind the cashier knew my name (they do their homework and this is definitely a sign of professionalism).One last info, there is no window.One of the good Sunday brunch of Singapore.

On the top floor of the Pan Pacific hotel, you access the restaurant via the exterior lifts which provide a wonderful view of Singapore. The menu consists of classic and new interpretations of Chinese cuisine. We had Peking duck to start with excellent crispy skin a very nice Hoi Sin sauce. For main we had ostrich and beef wok fried dishes with plenty of egg fried rice. Wine was expensive as it is everywhere in Singapore so we just had a glass each.Overall it was slightly over-priced, but the view plays a part in this - in total our bill was SGD 150. However, if budget isn't a problem then I recommend visiting this restaurant for a pleasant meal with an excellent view

Great views but average food...

Very good food, Great atmosphere. GO early and be the only ones there.

The a la carte buffet had some misses, but overall satisfied with the quality - aint cheap but spent it gladly... Point to note is the 1 serving of sharks fin/buddha justifies a big part of the price tag

Lemon chicken is nice!

Space is too small, Food just average, not value for money.

I celebrated my 50th Birthday with my family in April. Cost was approx SGD$220 for food, SGD$105 for drinks and extra tip of SGD$36 over and above the 10% service charge (they deserved it!).Food was ordered (not set menu) and arrived well presented and very tasty. View was stunning (although I thought it was a revolving restaurant, but it didn't move?).Service and friendliness was exceptional, when they found out it was my 50th Birthday, dessert for 4 was included free of charge! For special occasions I highly recommend this restaurant, we will remember this night for life

I called up to make a booking for my relatives in Singapore.However, on the first call they said the charges was $600++ per table.Afterwards, when I called again to confirm my booking they said it's $1000++ per table.How could they be so uncertain about their products? And blame that it must be the NEW staffs who doesn't know anything that spoke to me about it.Ridiculous Restaurant

I had a look at the web site and the Dim Sum promotion which ended last year was still listed. Went there on Sunday for Dim Sum. The place was quite busy and the food was quite good. The cost of each dim sum item was around the 80-90 baht range. The service was OK, nothing special. The atmosphere of the restaurant was your traditional family Chinese restaurant and not in line with a 5 star hotel. This restaurant needed to be freshened up

It was my 1st visit to this restaurant on the 37th Floor at Pan Pacific Hotel above Marina Square. A ride on the elevator(side of the building not the middle elevator) where you can see the surrounding area on Marina Bay & others.... Upon reaching the restaurant an hostess will ask for your name & company you to your table. A menu for the Sunday Cantonse Buffett Brunch for you to choose with unlimited order except for the lobster dumplings/Shark Fin Tart & soups.... (1st page on the menu). A great view around the area but the view was not as spectacular as Equinox Restaurant (Swissotel Stamford). Food was great not too cook or salty like other chinese food would taste. Really enjoy the Cod fish with preserved vege. A small corner of appetizers serve fruits, cakes, soya milk & others for you to enjoy yourself. (Self serve) The price was quit pricey as @ $48++ per person. Service was good but need more attention on water or tea refill. Waited a while for our water & tea to be refill

I must say the food at Hai Tien Lo was really not up to our expectations when we went there for a lunch celebration on a Sunday for 9 pax. It was $55+++ per pax for the weekend lunch buffet. I tried the wasabi mayonaise prawn which was supposed to be their speciality, but it doesn't taste as good as Peach Garden's. The rest of the food were just so so such as their fried rice and sweet and sour pork. Simple dishes like this also not that fantastic. then how to expect the chefs to produce other good dishes....definitely won't be going back there again.Sichuan Dou Hua at UOB building would offer better views and value for their food

good food and service

Good food, good view.

Good food. But some of the fusion food might not suit everyone.

Nice presentation and fresh ingredients with a good view if you sit near the edge which overlooks Marina Bay area.

Go there if you are looking for a view. What I like about this restaurant is the rather "unchinese" feel of the place. Even the food presentation appeared to me to be modern in approach. But the food remains authentically Chinese. Bravo!

good food, good view, top of the world

innovative chinese dishes.. romantic nite city view from top of the building

Best sharks fin soup

Food quite bland and boring
