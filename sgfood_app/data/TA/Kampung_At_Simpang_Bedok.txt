Mike's Caribbean serves fantastic jerk chicken, goat curry and other items. A very friendly and helpful chap too!

There are lotsa food stalls in this newly renovated food center. There's not lift so you will need to climb the stairs to level 2. The western food is great. Ah hua kelong; our locally bred seafood is also available here. Be prepared to queue for LokLok which is grilled skewed items. Try their tomato wrapped bacon which will burst in your mouth. The special pancake is a MUST have dessert. The wanton noodle also looks good but queue was too long. The great thing about this place is you will be served and if it's self serviced, high chance they will give you an electronic queue buzzer which will beep if your food is ready.

Revitalised eating area, whereby eastern and western meals co-exist. Nice old fashioned 70's decoration which brought back the old days.Nice ambience. Less crowd. Modern cooking at affordable prices. Simple meal of main course and drink about SGD $7.Enjoyed. Tasty meals. Visited twice in April 2016. There's also a good choice of Halal food at a row off coffeeshops below this venue.For those drivers, theres limited parking space. Parking will be a problem on Saturday, Sunday & Public Holidays.
