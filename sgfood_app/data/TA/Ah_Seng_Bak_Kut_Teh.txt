Nice bak kut teh that's very near to Intercontinental Hotel. You can ask for refill of the soup too. Very pepper-ish.

Perfectly cooked pork and well-seasoned soup. What more could I ask for? I loved it enough to eat there for two consecutive nights in Singapore. Staff is attentive, location is easy to find. Will definitely go back.

Nothing fantastic, one of those newly sprung up BKT restaurants with average food n not cheap prices. $7.10 for a very small bowl of BKT which only tastes of white pepper, no vege and one small bowl of rice. Thanks but won't come again.

Saw the restaurant when arriving in Singapore on the way to hotel. Decided to tried the next day.
One of the best Bak Kut Teh I tried. Also ordered the preserved vegetable and yao tiu. The place was clean and kids friendly.

Ah Seng was our last-night, last-minute, last-meal choice for Singapore and didn't disappoint - the Bak Kut Teh was very tasty (garlic and pepper for days!) and consistently replenished, prices were fair, decoration was simple and clean.There are more highly rated and frequented places around Singapore, but we were certainly very happy with the soups we ordered

2 kinds of pork rib soup (bak kut teh) are available, spare ribs and prime ribs. The soup is Singapore style which is clear soup with lots of garlic and pepper. However, it is not as tasty as Founder (the other popular stall) but good enough.Street foods in a local coffeeshop (kopitiam) right across from Bugis Junction makes it easily accessible. I liked the wall decor of the shop which puts you back in the 1950s

Pros: nice place with good decorations, Very Attractive ... Food presentation was goodCons: I'm not certain if Bak Kuh Teh is something like in PenangWas expecting for more Herbalist Chinese soup and not a Typical white Pepper soup.Overall: it kinda Ok ... Just Too Peppered to me

If there is a nomination for a Singaporean dish, that will probably be "bak kut teh." This pork based soup is widely known among the Chinese community. Ah Seng may not to be the best, but it is still remarkable. The signature bak kut teh is refreshing, the preserved vegetables with braised pork is good, and the omelettes are tasty

Had lunch here yesterday and it was surprisingly good. There were two staff on duty and, while they were kept busy by around 8 tables of diners, service was pretty fast. Our food and drinks came to the table within 10 minutes.We ordered a bowl of premium spare ribs as well as pork ribs. The soup was peppery and staff willingly refilled it. The meat was soft and easy to get off the bone. The spare ribs were a little more bony in nature but was soft as well. The plate of steamed pork was not bad, and was quite flavourful. The preserved vegetables were weak, though, and not even salty, though that would appeal to the more health conscious, I guess. We also got a bowl of you tiao, which went well with the soup.Bottled drinks came with a old fashioned tin cup, and were the small bottles of coke etc.A meal for two cost slightly over S$30

Ordered pork ribs bak kut teh with rice. When I visited in October, they have just moved from a nearby shop, therefore it was new and very clean. Soup was a little spicy, with very strong taste of pepper. Although there were not many customers, waitresses were not very attentive and were chatting among themselves. Had to prompt them a few times to add soup
