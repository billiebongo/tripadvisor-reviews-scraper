Lovely outdoor view and atmosphere. The service was great, and the Empress folks were attentive to us. Food is decent.

We have had 3different main courses and a dessert and paid 115dollars with water an 3 alcoholic drinks

Food was great, service was awesome. Would definitely want to go back again and will recommend friends too!

Another delightful lunch at Empress. The food, service and atmosphere were excellent. My husband chose the a la carte menu and I had the $48 set menu. The Pandan creme brûlée was delicious.
4
We went to a large corporate dinner, so we didnâ€™t choose what we ate, but dishes ranged from above average to very good. The main assets of the place are the superb view of Boat Quay, and the excellent service from a friendly and efficient team
4
The restaurant is beautifully set within the Asian Civilisations Museum offering scenic view of the Singapore River and the towering skyscrapers within the Central Business District. Exquisitely crafted dim sum and mouth-watering main courses - roast duck, seared Angus beef tenderloin cubes, poached amaranth with trio of eggs - enhanced the Chinese Lunar New Year festivity. The only downside was the insufficient number of service staff plaguing most F&B establishments in Singapore. However, this deficiency was adequately made up by an excellent (and very pleasant) lady server of Chinese national origin. She made our family lunch that much more special by taking care of our needs despite the demands of other diners

Great location. Set in the heart of the ACM the Resturant is tastefully decorated and classy. Food was really good with little touches that made the experience really welcoming. From table snacks, to Polaroid photo to ladies leaving gifts these touched added to the night. Service could do with being more attentive and flowing, but not a deal breaker. My inlaws are Chinese and they loved the food; flavour and quality so all good. Value for money. Great food spread and a nudge over $200. Was expecting much more. (Only one glass of wine though)Will come back.

Had a lovely dinner here and the setting sitting outside was beautiful by the river. The service here was good and the menu had a nice selection to choose from. Prices are quite high but a nice treat in a lovely location and setting so worth a visit
1
The food is good enough to mask the horrendous service. They can't even get splitting of a bill right and this is after the third try. Also so rude about making a mistake. No offer of making up for wasting our time and being WRONG.
5
Have a a lovely dinner here! Beautiful setting, fab menu and amazing staff. Definitely worth enjoying an evening here.
5
Nice and excellent services .. All is well organized .. amazing overall. I would like to travel again ..

Should visit once - Great ambience!
I have heard from my friend who loves Family trips and having fun!
5
Very good service, and excellent dimsum served.
Creative mains and desserts.
Great view of the Singapore River.
5
We had the dim sum brunch on a weekend. The food is delicious, the ambience is nice. Servicing staff is very attentive. Overall a great dinning experience.
5
After absorbing food for thought at the ACM - Asian Civilization Museum, stop in for a lunch or dinner of excellent traditional Chinese cuisine and wonderful service at Empress. The skyline along the river is a feast for the eyes.
5
Had a lovely riverside brunch at Empress on a Saturday. From start to finish, the food served were excellent. We were given a starter each, 3 mains to share, a dessert each and unlimited servings of dim sum. I loved the king prawn and beef soup, siew mai, sweet and sour pork and the bubur cha cha in particular. The service was excellent and the staff were very attentive as well. Ambience was a 10/10 and the price was very reasonable too. Excellent!

This place has a lovey outlook and ambience. It’s kind of a built-in veranda beside the colonial structure of the museum and facing the river. It has a nice open and airy feeling and is well lit but without being overly bright. We had the dim sum brunch on Sunday. The food is just ok; nothing special. There are many better dim sum places in Singapore. The service is quite pedestrian. We had wrong dishes served (no matter as it’s all you can eat$ and had to follow-up twice to get our tea. But it’s the food that is just average and with so many better options it’s unlikely we will be back.
5
I tend to avoid Chinese food in Singapore because of the copious amounts of MSG they put in the food - but this is the nicest Chinese restaurant I have eaten at in Singapore. I went with a couple of friends for lunch. The lunch menu was superb with lovely service in a beautiful setting. Can highly recommend it.
5
A great location by the river. It was a fantastic dim sum meal with plenty if choice. The beverage package made enjoying the meal easy. Staff were friendly and attentive.
2
We were not being told that the 2nd serving of peking duck has extra costing till the bill came! Debated with a lady and she did not know how to react. Poor customer service.
5
2nd time here for lunch. Love the set lunch. Food quality is excellent as usual and service was good. Nice for couples or for business lunch.
5
Celebrated my birthday with family and we had an wonderful time! It was our first time dining at Empress and we were very happy with the food, service and price! The restaurant is in the prime location at the ground level of the Asian Civilization Museum, about 600m from the Raffles Place MRT station.  It has some outdoor seating with an amazing riverview and the indoor has nice modern decorating with beautiful flower on the tableside . We ordered salted egg tofu, Peking duck, honey pork, scallops with asparagus and Gailan, all very delicious! The staff were very friendly and the service was very good. I got a surprise free dessert for the birthday! My daughter and myself also each got a pack of orange blossom madeleines when we were leaving the restaurant. The madeleines are only for the ladies! We had a wonderful and enjoyable evening at Empress! Thank you
5
This was probably the best meal we had on our 2 week trip in Asia. Granted, we didn’t dine at 5 star, top dollar restaurants. We usually spent about $40-80 per person, and within that range this was as good if not better than you can expect. Only ‘warning’ is drinks are very pricey (our food was very reasonable but a couple of cocktails added about $45 to the bill). The atmosphere is great and the service was very good as well. Highly recommended!
5
Superb meal today. Nice staff too. Had a very smiley Chinese lady serve our table. Meat selection was great. Har gao excellent. All was great to be honest. Real surprise for me were the deserts. I, like most westerners are not huge fans of Chinese deserts. We had the sticky date pudding and the panna cotta with coconut ice. Loved them both. Really loved the panna cotta. Hit of the lunch for me was the singapore chilli prawn dish. Was excellent. Only thing I wasn't sold on was the baked xiao long bao. Interesting concept but think I personally prefer the purely steamed version. Loved the little individual baskets for them though.
4
We went for a dimsum brunch. Couldn’t book our chosen time online, so booked 45 mins later. Restaurant was almost empty when we arrived. We chose to order alacarte rather than the all you can eat brunch. Food was very good as was service. Enjoyed the duck salad although the dressing was a bit sweet- balance of flavour not quite there but almost. It’s a lovely restaurant, very westernised form of dim sum. Quiet and seemingly almost made to order. Still we enjoyed it.
5
Great place to have dinner along the river but without being bothered by all the tourists who are on the other side of the river (which has restaurants side by side)Empress is a calm oasis is this neighborhood, with a beautiful view.We had an outdoor table and it was a lovely evening.The food was very tasty, the service attentive, the decor serene
4
We went to Empress for dinner in a large table of 8. The food is always well-presented, and mainly served Chinese style (ie sharing portions served on the table), but it somehow felt like we were in a fine dining restaurant.Service was absolutely good, except when they seemed to have lost track of two of our desserts, leaving the rest of the table waiting a few minutes for them to finally serve all the individual portions.Food wise, the menu is also quite traditional Chinese, but with a twist that brings a refreshing touch to the meal.Overall, the set dinner with 2 appetizers, 3 mains, soup, rice or noodles and dessert was good value for S$58++ per head, given the surroundings and service standards
5
We wanted to eat in the area of the quays but wanted a more refined environment. This absolutely met our requirements. Beautiful surroundings, great service and delicious food. They open the glass at the front to the quay so that you feel like you are outside but it remains cool and relaxed. We enjoyed it so much we returned again in our stay. Highly recommended
5
Lovely location and setting, attentive staff and delicious food. Certainly a worthwhile experience if you are seeking a Chinese meal while in Singapore.
3
Good Chinese food, in a smart restaurant with a large waterfront terrace. Reasonable atmosphere. Expensive. Probably more suited to a business dinner on expenses.
5
This is my second time here. I was impressed after my first visit and decided to bring my Mum for her birthday. Food was great and service too even on Christmas Eve.
4
My second visit to the restaurant. Always like the atmosphere & location. Food quality is good. Recommended
5
New Year's Eve is not the best time to make last minute arrangements for dinner, so when my wife and I were looking for somewhere to eat near the marina and Clarke quay areas, we stumbled upon this gem of a place.Our initial enquiry at the front of house was with Jackson, who couldn't have been more friendly and accommodating of our request for a late booking.Upon our arrival later that evening Jackson had organized a table with a fantastic view and surprise signature dessert and photos to commemorate our recent silver wedding anniversary.The food was incredible and whilst we are not experts in Singapore restaurant prices, I can tell you that it was a fraction of the cost of marina bay restaurants just a few minutes away. 6 courses for SGD58 on New Year's Eve at a riverfront location has to represent great value in our books!Fabian and Elon also deserve commendation for their professional and friendly service, all of which added to a memorable evening for us.So thanks to all at Empress restaurant and we hope to visit again sometime
5
Celebrated friend’s birthday here as well as an early Christmas gathering on Sunday 24 Dec. Enjoyed the food, company and champagne. We’re small eaters so didn’t really take full advantage of the unlimited servings of dimsum but the quality of food was there. We love the king prawn dumpling in supreme broth - the broth was thick and flavorful as well as the roast pork, pork ribs and angus beef cubes. And yes, the Perrier Jouët completed the meal perfectly
4
My husband and I want a quite night with good food. And enjoyed just that. We started with the Teapot Soup: a delicious broth and dumpling. We then shared the Peking Duck which comes two ways. First, the skin is cut off in thin layers and served with pancakes and accompanying sides. Nest you get to chose how the rest of the duck is served. We choose rice, it was good but a bit disappointing. The restaurant setting was lovely and so was the service.
5
Food is delectable, portion size just nice, teapot soup a must try, beautifully done char sui as well and many other delicious dishes. Service is one of only places in Singapore where you are properly pampered and do not have to ask for anything. What a joy. Pricing is reasonable enough too
4
Empress Place used to be the heart of the old city in Singapore hundred of years ago, what was preserved today is an amazing touch of the old world elegance and new world buzz, take a walk down memory lane along the river and you can see how far Singapore have progress in the last 50 years
5
We happened to be at Victoria Concert Hall for a job. After the job, we needed to have a late snack and walked along Singapore River. We managed to secure the terrace seat. The drinks were reasonably priced and the food was good especially the dim sum. The service staff was very attentive and ready to answer any service request.We love the place and will definitely return to eat there on our next gig there
5
Good food and service. We took the executive lunch set which was value for money and v tasty. Nice presentation of food too.
4
Service and atmosphere were good. The food was also good. Only water was provided. Other drinks will be charged extra.
4
Good ambience, good food & good range of Tea. They are very generous with refilling, regardless of Tea or food. Though there are 1 or 2 items that were not so impressive but we are alright with it.
4
First time at this great location. Do ... good food (although not necessarily outstanding for all the dishes) and nice wine combined with overwhelmed service given that not enough staff available to serve all tables.
4
We went for the free flow champagne/prosecco dim sum brunch. Decor was gorgeous!! Food was good and a modern twist on dim sum. Service was really good!
5
Visited here after reading reviews and glad we did. We opted for the set menu which was really good value for money and absolutely everything was presented beautifully and tasted wonderful. Service was excellent too.
4
Went there for a birthday the experience was a delight and a complimentary dessert with lighted candle for birthday really made it extra special. Our fav was the peking duck and fried rice, really yummy. The rest unfortunately wasnt quite so tasty and wasnt that value for monies
5
I took my Husband for his Birthday, we sat outside with a view of the river and the large sky scrapers of CBD. The staff were so friendly and took care of us with efficiency (ensuring our courses arrived with minimal wait time) and warmth. We had a 5 course set menu, every item was delicious. Really romantic setting, but, also good for a dinner with friends and business meetings
3
Was here for a business lunch and the quality of the food is not comparable with the decor. The service is ok. The Chef tries very hard to give a modern take to chinese food and local dishes. Am very upset with the interpretation of the or-Nee and Bobo ChaCha. These 2 dishes are completely misrepresented. There are much better quality for lunch at other Michelin-rated restaurants for the same price.
4
I was here for a working lunch which I arranged. Back-end staff were professional and accommodating, and were able to respond to last minute changes. Duly impressed. The actual experience though, while nothing to complain about, was less professional. The waiting staff did not appear well trained when asking for options, and sometimes appeared to be cutting in to conversations. At times, they also dropped the plates a bit too hard on the table, giving the impression they were shoving you the food. And none of them smiled. It was all very robotic and they actually looked quite sullen. The food was alright, but not the standard of the finer Cantonese restaurants in the city. Stand out was the tea pot soup, let down was the roasted meats. Wait staff needs better training. At the moment, they seem more above average casual than business fine dining
4
Quality of Food - Being Vegetarian the selection of food was good and presentation excellent
Quality of Service - Staff quite attentive but still scope of improvement
Ambience - Nice
Location - Need to walk to reach the place.
5
Clean and always crowded easy to access thru MRT, taxi or buses. Courtesy and alert staff. Can cash or cards for payment
5
Was there to celebrate my 25th year wedding anniversary. Service was excellent. ambient is super and will definitely re-visit again
5
came here for post dinner drinks before movie. decor was really comfortable with warm lights, and lots of orchids, and staff were v attentive and friendly as well.
5
I have to highly recommend this place to everyone! To be honest the food is average . But the hospitality is top notch! The staff were extremely attentive and amazing! I will definitely want to go & dine there again!
5
The waiter there is very friendly and attentive to us. They even prepared a complimentary cake for the birthday celebration. We really enjoyed the dinner very much. Thank you!
5
Went to Empress last night & all three of us thoroughly enjoyed the sharing menu. Great variety of food; fun & fresh flavours. Staff all had smiles on their faces!
5
Impressive views on skyscrapers, this restaurant is located a side the river and it's terrace has a very nice and romantic atmosphere. Looking at the skyline you can enjoy very nice food. The menu has enough choice. The crackling pork was fantastic i must say. Definitely worth a visit if you are in Singapore and i would go back for sure
4
The restaurant has an indoor section and an outdoor section which faces the Singapore river and downtown skyline. The food is also good - mostly comfort food style. One challenge is seating during busy hours - the staff simply cannot clean and manage the tables fast enough - that needs to improv
5
As we were sitting having a drink at one of the many bars at the Boat Quay - we noticed a nice outdoor restaurant at the other side of Singapore river, - and ended up at the Empress - at a nice table by the river. Great food, modern asian, nice wine list - and very attentive service, - and a very cozy atmosphere
5
Empress, delivers best service and excellent cuisine recipe updates.
Good value and tasty business lunch sets.
4
We took the dim sum buffet at the Empress at the 11.00 a.m. slot. There was no one else around and we had the place to ourselves. The food was good and value for money.
4
It was a pleasant get-together dinner at the Empress.
The service was good and we were glad we chose the set-dinner menu.
The tea pot soup was high recommended.
Will be back to try other dishes :)
5
Good service and ambience. Good food and value for money. The staff were very attentive and polite.very good atmosphere
5
My friends and I went to Empress for their dim sum a la carte last Sunday. The food ordered was fresh and delicious, and it was not noisy though the restaurant was busy.
5
We had a wonderful evening at Empress. The service was to the point and forthcoming, the atmosphere lovely, with smooth jazz playing in the background. The food creations are sophisticated and delicious, but would have expected slightly larger portions for the price. All in all: excellent!
5
I must say the service was impeccable. We were served by Yon, who was extremely attentive and sensitive towards the dietary requirements of the diners (3 vegetarians in the party and 2 regular). He was also very swift and tactful with the birthday surprise arrangements and bill payment - casually informing me about the surprise details behind the menu while I was ordering dessert and did not bring my mum the bill when she asked for it, understanding that my partner and I would pay without us having to verbalise it. On to the food - overall delicious and very palatable, even for the vegetarian dishes which is rare in non-vegetarian restaurants. They had a sizeable selection too. We particularly liked that they did not use mock meat and relied on a nice variety of veg-friendly ingredients like mixed mushrooms, pine nuts, goji berries etc. Do try the Medley Brown Rice, Three Mushroom Stir-fry and Broccoli Salad. I particularly LOVED the Vegetarian Ma Po Tofu. The Pandan Gula Melaka Creme Brulee is a MUST TRY. Light but a delight to the tastebuds. Ambience is also fantastic. For anything really, business dinners, girls' night out, family get togethers, special occasions etc. It'll be our go-to place from now on.Empress, you have new fans and thank you for a pretty royal (in its own right) experience. :
4
This quite smart restaurant is just over the Cavanagh Bridge from Fullerton Square and is literally less than a 3 minute walk from The Fullerton Hotel.Great food, atmosphere & friendly service.Would definitely recommend and will go again if we are in Singapore.If you find this review helpful I would really appreciate a helpful vote

Was here for dinner. The place was dark and we were not seated at the best section. Although the restaurant was modern it did not have the usual elegance found in other quality Chinese restaurants, therefore do not expect a classy and relaxing dinner. It is more in line if you are thinking of a night of clubbing starting from dinner. Think modern, hip and western. I would probably prefer it during the day since it should appear less busy. It is fine though if the food had delivered.Unfortunately the food was not too impressive. Taste was noted on the surface of the ingredients but lacking on further bite. I do not like overly strong flavours and prefer delicate tastes. However, the dishes here were neither strong in taste nor refined. It was bland except like I said, on the surface. Most items were trying to be interesting in their presentations but fell flat as consideration for the food was sacrificed; so what I got was a little pretentiousness. Many of the dishes were simply presented to 'wow' the diner but the true value of food was missing. None of the items left an impression.Service was minimal and if you require anything, you need to ask and then it may still not be delivered.I would think this as more of a hip place to dine Chinese but not anywhere near the standard of fine dining. The interior was good if that's what you like, food was at most average and price, overpriced for what it truly was.I may visit again, to check out the place during the day but I can't foresee myself visiting for more than 2 times
5
My wife and I visited this restaurant last night. The waiter was very friendly and provided excellent service. The atmosphere was great and eating outdoors gives you a good river view. Good prices that weren’t too high and the quality of the food was outstanding. We had the vegetarian bee hoon, crispy sesame chicken and the baked Shanghai soup dumplings for main and starters and it was all tasty and delightful. For dessert we had the pudding and crime brûlée, which was delicious however servings were smaller than desired. Overall though was an enjoyable night out and would recommend
5
Visited empress for dinner for our 2 year anniversary. Got an amazing table with a gorgeous view. The waiter was helpful, attentive and very friendly and the food was delicious. the XO scallops in particular were outstanding. Highly recommended, had a great experience here.
5
Will recommend this place. Peaceful environment with wonderful ambience. The food is well prepared and taste good too.
4
Warmth Ambience. Lighting just right for relaxation. Thumbs up for Presentation and Taste of Food! Has its own creation of Dessert!
4
Booked this restaurant for my partners 40th birthday and we were not disappointed, the food was delicious and the service was excellent. The location on the river is lovely and we enjoyed a nice walk with wonderful city views after dinner.
5
It was through a word-of-month recommendation that we four ladies decided to have a birthday dinner celebration at Empress. It was a perfect location to enjoy great food and yarn to our heart's content amidst a stylish ambience. We ordered the $58 p/p set dinner which presented a lovely array of choices. Definitely great value considering the ambience and superb standard of service. The desserts were particularly delectable. We highly recommend the Pandan Creme Brulee, the Orh Nee and the Sticky Date Pudding. Wine choices and prices were reasonable too
5
It's a biz dinner on Friday. The venue is superb with spectacular view of the Bay Area. Food is expected to be of tourist quality given the location. And especially it is Chinese, I would expect a lot of so called fusion dishes. When the food came, it changed my perception completely. It is authentic enough to be called Chinese and to be more exact Cantonese food. The wine list is impressive too. I would not hesitate to recommend this for business or personal purpose
4
Good ambience, was given the indoor table whereby I had the view of the riverside and the opposite skyscrapers. As the sky dimmed to darkness, the view came alive with the glittering lights. Food wise, we chose the 2 pax dinner set. Excellent taste especially the soup, concentrated and tasty. Will definitely go back again.
4
We had dim sum brunch from 11-1. They have 3 seatings - 11 to 1 at 48++; 12-2 and 1-3 all at 58++. The place was quite crowded after 12. Seats weren't too comfy, and utensils were worn. It's time to change the worn-out china really. Doesn't fit the image of the restaurant. Didn't have too many options but a lot of surprises. They did a new creation twist to most traditional stuff like baked Shanghai Xiao Long Bao and minced Angus beef soup. There are more fanciful items that limits to one order per customer. We find the Angus beef tenderloin cubes tasty, but a bit too rare in some cubes and was hard to tear into smaller bites. The giant prawn in chicken stock was very tasty. Food presentation was also befitting. The triple roast platter was also sumptuous. The only issue was with the inconsistency. When the kitchen got crowded and busy, they didn't bake the buns till they are thoroughly baked through and the buns got served cold (lukewarm at bottom). We had it sent back to kitchen.
5
Empress is a wonderful combination of great Chinese food and nice and cozy environment,which is not a given thing regarding Chinese food.I went to Empress quite often and the outdoor seating is always so nice that we couldn't resist the temptation of enjoying a Mojito there
2
This place should be ashamed of their service:1) made a reservation for 4 outside. arrived promptly and there were plenty of open tables for 4 with a nice view. They tried to shove it into a table in the middle of the patio with no view. We asked for one of the other tables. They said these tables are for people with a reservation. We explained that we have a reservation (as we already told them when we entered). They stare blankly at us without a word and still try to steer us to a cramped tabled. We say no, and insist on a table with the a view.2) they tried to rush us to order, and then we were abandoned for the rest of the time. Was impossible to get a refill on water or another drink. 3) they brought one main course meal about 15 min after the other. 4) we had to ask 3 times for our rice, and it only arrived at the end of the meal; jeez thanks.5) Prices are a rip off. You pay about 50% extra for the view...Real pity since the food and view is nice
4
Empress is in a gorgeous location and sitting outside with a strategically placed fan was wonderful. Opted for the tasting menu and was not disappointed- the soup was the standout dish. Great service with informed staff. A real treat for a high end feel.
5
Come here for the view, stay for the food. The dim sum is creative - particularly the baked xiaolongbao.
5
Very good location., good food, good service, will go again, good view, it would be better if the weather is cooler
5
The ambience is excellent. The food is good and the service excellent. There are also books on Singapore relevant to the National Museum in which it is located.
5
Nice restaurant, elegant ,great location with beautiful view,good food and great service
We will be back soon

Empress is perhaps the coolest Chinese restaurant in Singapore, with sleek and luxurious interiors, and a killer view in the historic Asian Civilization Museum.We had gone to Empress for our family's New Years Day dinner, and the food was excellent. The fish in a clay pot was the standout with great flavor and texture, but the Peking duck fell flat - the skin was not crispy and there was no finesse in how the duck was carved. Prices were fair and very much reasonable.Service however, could be improved. Between cluelessness and unfriendliness, it's hard to decide which was worse to deal with when it came to the staff.Overall, I liked the food, loved the ambience, but hated the service
5
Empress is nestled on the water side, across from the Fullerton Hotel and surrounded by gorgeous buildings, most recently renovated and restored - Art, Asian Classics, and Historical significance. Fabulous food and a terrific wine list - I have enjoyed friends' conversation, variety of drinks while enjoying the beautiful night lights and Singapore waterline. Food wise, we had dinner previously and enjoyed the flavours as well as variety (one was vegetarian and one was gluten free special needs)Highly recommended especially if you have special guests in town for a visit
5
I will like to thank the restaurant and the team for the attention given to our table when i chose this restaurant to host my hong kong associates.They were amazed by how the culinary team were able to recreate Chinese dishes with such creativity.The ambience of Empress was just perfect and the attention to details by Aidil and Fabian impressed them no end. Thank you for the complimentary cocktail to start the evening as well as the Kuek Pie Tie to make my guests wonder what was that dish.. you made me look good to my guests.Special mention to Jia Wen, the young chinese girl who ran to meet me at the hostess desk to welcome me. She has the warmest smile. To Aidil who so patiently explained the chef's curated menu to me and giving suggestion to change some ingredients to suit my guests. Fabian has been most professional, always checking on us to ensure all is good.Lastly, the sweet surprise of farewell gifts. That was most thoughtful.
5
Came for the weekend dim sum brunch buffet ($48 per person, for the 11am–1pm seating) and had a wonderful meal! The food was fresh and delicious and the wait staff provided attentive service. What I liked was that the orders for the dim sum (unlimited servings of it) were by number of pieces rather than baskets – that helped to ensure no food got wasted
5
Great location away from crowd during weekday CBD crazy lunchtime, facing the famous Boat Quay and you get awesome view of Singapore river if you are up for the outdoor seats.They are sharing space with Asian Civilian Museum, so if you have spare time I guess you wish to check out their new exhibition in town. Service are pretty good - staff are friendly, hotel lounge standard interior and good food with decent price tag. I love this place, have been visiting them on monthly basis and totally see the needs to share my views of them
3
Go there for the decor and high ceilings. Food was so so. The rice was hard and dry. Sweet and sour pork nice.
5
2nd time at Empress and the food doesn't disappoint at all! We were there for Father's Day dinner and suffice to say, my dad was extremely pleased with the food.
5
The har gau and pointy spring row are sensational. Nice ambience, too. Outdoor seating will be silly though. Will definitely come back.
5
The staffs are friendly and the service there is very good. The staffs surprised my mum with a lovely dessert saying "happy birthday" and even gave us a card with all of their signatures. The food are really good as well!

Empress Restaurant is located in the rear of Asian Civilisation Restaurant, along the banks of Singapore River. Parking will be a little inconvenient if u drive.This restaurant offers both indoor and outdoor seatings, although there is no physical divider between the indoor and outdoor. They made use of huge air curtain to keep the indoors cool.They play contemporary Jazz Music and maybe that is why the restaurant appeals to Caucasian Crowd. We ordered a few of their Signature dishes1. Roast Chao Siew (not the best that I have tasted)2. Thick Soup in a Teapot3. Double boiled chicken and prawn soup in young coconut4. Stir fried Wagyu Beef Hor Fun (A lot of people liked to use "Wagyu" beef, but I am very sure the beef they served is not wagyu.5. Crispy Japanese Halibu Fillet (Fish is fresh and deep fried to perfection)6. Twice mushroom with Homemade Bean curd7. Siew Mai with Japanese Scallop. Again Scallop is not from Japan as claimed.8. Burbur Cha Cha (Sweet Potato, shaved coconut crushed ice, banana, yam). Tasted quite good, although presentation can be improved.If you are touring Singapore River, and looking for a Chinese Restaurant along the River, Empress will be a recommended choice versus the restaurants on the opposite bank. Might not appeal to local Singaporeans though.
5
Outstanding service and food! We booked a few hours before arriving for a birthday lunch (insincere friends we are) and they assigned a semi private table and birthday dessert, complete with wordings and Polaroid shot. The staff at our table was attentive and I have no idea how they figured out who was celebrating their birthday. Observant bunch
5
It was our Wedding Anniversary and our children chose this restaurant. Walking into this restaurant, one will not know it is actually serving Chinese food as it looks like any European restaurant. The Chinese food is excellent as well as the ambiance. This is not a fusion restaurant - thank goodness. This is an excellent Chinese restaurant and the price is reasonable considering the good food and beautiful surrounding. The desserts were unusual but but my children loved them. The portion is a little small which made the deserts a little pricey. Complimentary valet parking is provided. This add class and convenience to the place.We really enjoyed the after dinner walk along the Singapore River. The imposing buildings opposite the restaurant provided a beautiful sight. We love this place
5
Great restaurant only on few minutes walk from our hotel. Please talk to your waiter about recommendations as everything he recommended was fantastic (chilli crab rolls and empress fried rice ) hope to visit Singapore again so can sit on their terrace for great food and great food
5
The food was excellent. There is wide selection of options. The waiter was attentive, helpful, and not intrusive. The venue is lovely. In the evening the breeze off the river provides a fine environment for outdoor seating, but if it is too hot, the indoor seating is equally fine.
4
Celebrated Mother's Day at Empress on Saturday, Dim Sum Brunch. As we went during 2-4pm slot, it wasn't very crowded and the environment was exclusive and quiet, with few diners and staff attentively attending to us. The service was good. As it was a buffet, we ordered every dish to taste and the overall taste we felt that the dishes was quite salty. However, the soup and porridge are very nice. All the dim sum are nicely made and presented. We didn't order the tea. Perhaps it would be nice to have the tea to go with the overall salty dishes. It would be great if the food can be less salty.
4
The only downside was the gin and tonic which neither of us liked. Everything else was great. Thumbs up.

Lovely staffs, good foods. Good location. You should visit this restaurant if you travel to Singapore.

Very nice place and really good dim sum. It's close to late in the evening. I recommend it to all dim sum lovers
4
Dinner was enjoyable, service was prompt, only slight gripe was the lobster spinach dumplings were quite normal, didn't have enough of the lobster bits.
5
we love the food, the place, the atmosphere and the location. The brunch is fun with the dim sum free flow.

Read alot of good reviews about this restaurant, so decided to have dinner here to celebrate my mom's birthday. The food was great. We ordered the signature set. The beef and prawn were exceptionally delicious. I especially like the orh nee. Service was very good and they were very attentive to our needs. They even made my mom a special birthday "shou tao" dish and also a birthday card! Thank you!!
5
I requested for a table outdoors where we had a great view of the river at sunset. While ordering we were given a mini basket of taro chips & crackers to munch on. They're quite addictive and we swept them clean within minutes. Kuddos to the staff who promptly brought a second serving without us having to ask.Food was served pretty quickly. Do note that the tables at the terrace are rather small and can contain at best 4-5 dishes at the same time. We particularly enjoyed the Giant Tiger Prawns (4x100g for $48) and Empress fried rice ($20). But what really impressed us was the service. All the staff were extremely friendly and responsive. What made the experience extra special was that the restaurant surprised us with a complimentary longevity bun each after knowing that we were celebrating my Dad's birthday. One of them even offered to take a family photo for us using the restaurant's polaroid. When we left, this was given to my Dad in a birthday card. Overall it was a very pleasant meal. A big thank you to the staff at Empress for the warm service!

A place not to be missed as Empress place is near the landing place of Sir Stamford Raffles, the founder father of Singapore. This place is so beautiful and great place to visit; great place to visit and can have a plesent meal and also for a short tea break in the day time and a great place for drinks and watch night fall. Evening with soundering lighting is a special night sceen and nearby beautful lighting.You will not be disappointed with friendly atmosphere. sorry for typo error...

I went there twice and both experiences were great. It is a restaurant with great ambience (if you sit inside) and great view (overlooking boat quay if you opt for seats outside). The food was well presented and very tasty, although it is a bit pricey for the potion served. We particularly enjoyed the happy hour deal (5-8pm even for weekends), with house wine costing only SGD6.5!!! The staff were also very attentive and helpful. Overall, it was a great experience and it is definitely one of my top choices for after work chill-out place!! Will come back for sure!
5
Really friendly
Really delicious
Enjoyed the ambience
Service was friendly
I love the beef wedges dish
4
Very interesting way of doing their food. Though some items are way too salty! Excellent service and a view that wont disappoint you.
5
Though it was only a 2pax dinner affair, the view from our table was magnificent. In addition, the service and food quality have once again wow us in a different presentation but taste perfectly.
5
Superb food, the set meal was an excellent choice, while nothing was "fancy" or "weird" everything was well executed. What a view as well. Great venue for a pre-show.
5
Top class Decor. Enjoyable experience celebrating Chinese Year and eating some traditional food. Slightly above average food but not exceptional. Great location and views but it comes with a price tag.
4
Being born in the 70's, the nostalgia this place brings is just emotional. Oriental decor fills the room, living up to its name while softly, the background plays an old shanghai tune. Fused also with modern lightings and other not-so-old decor, so that one don't get lost back in time, the evening outdoor breeze blows lightly into the air-condition room where conversations and dinning begins. Some food preparation was slow, even though it wasn't a full house, but we were allowed to cancel some orders as we were rushing to catch a movie. No charge was exercised for those cancellations and we were thankful. However, it was rather difficult to harness the attention of the busy and hardworking service staff. Several long minutes were invested in that area and we felt could be greatly improved. All the ladies walked off with a "freebie snack" that evening packed in a nice brown paper bag. When asked why the men don't get it, they replied because only the women get to be THE EMPRESS. Nice...
3
Food is over seasoned, service staff are not very attentive. Had informed the staff I have a wheel chair bounded elder coming for the meal and he lacked the common sense to take away the chair until I requested him to do so. The only thing I really enjoy is the ambience.
5
As we were spending a long weekend in Singapore we came around dinnertime across this restaurant. We decided to have dinner and were able to sit on the terrace outside so we could not only enloy the good food and friendly service but also the nice vieuw across the water and boats passing by.......The food was very tasty and for a reasonable price, considering being in Singapore
5
We were lucky the weather was good so we could enjoy dinner on the terrace. Magical! The view towards Boat Quay, the Fullerton and the Bank of China Building... Boats drifting by add to the atmosphere... The food is really good and for very decent prices. The choice of wine by the glass is also nice. The service could have been a little bit more attentive, but the terrace was popular so they had to work hard
4
I visited this restaurant when visiting Asian Civilisations Museum. This place is such a fresh and clean, staff is great and food was really really good. Also the desserts are beyond regular. Terrace outside is a big plus if you want to eat outside.Thank you
4
We had a romantic dinner here, very good food, nice location but poor service!
We had sesame chicken with lime sauce and green beans with pork & shrimps,
beautiful food, but sadly poor service, so we went for another place for dessert :-)
5
Funky Chinese shanghai 1930 revamped Art Deco sort of style - great ambiance and quite good food. Had an enjoyable time there. Great views of the Boat Quay without the crowds.
4
Great food & location. We sat outdoors on the terrace overlooking the water. Food was very good. The dumplings were great. The whole fish was perfectly done.
5
The staff were v meticulous about service and the guests general well being. They made us enjoy the meal v much. The food were impeccably prepared and some dishes have great presentation as well. Will definitely come again!
5
This has to be one of the best brunch spots in Singapore at the moment.
Great food, great venue, beautiful atmosphere and good value.
5
This is the classiest bar/restaurant that you will find in Singapore. Magnificent service, beautiful features with a view to beat any other.It also has an amazing choice of refreshments including two of Singapore's locally brewed beers which were delightful.Next time, we will find here for sure as the restaurant has an equally amazing reputation.Unbeatable, which for Singapore is high praise indeed
4
We held a customer thank you event at this venue and I am still patting my back on selecting this place as the feedback from my bosses and the guests was all positive! The sales staff that attended to our event was helpful, flexible and attentive so planning stage for the event was a breeze. On the evening itself, the food and wait service for the night was impeccable. Wait staff were efficient and attended to guest requests promptly. Duty Manager who oversaw the evening was in constant update on when drinks were finishing and of any adhoc orders from guests. We had booked the entire indoor section of restaurant but were allowed to use the outdoor section for cocktail hour as there was no event booked there. This offered our guests an excellent view of the CBD Skyline and the Singapore river and boat quay. The venue is not too big so with our 90pax it was slightly squeezey but the guests enjoyed themselves too much to notice and we even had a hard time getting people to leave at the end. Overall a very satisfied customer.
4
My first visit here and it's impressive ! The succulent assorted meat platter delivers melt-in-your-mouth char siew and honey spare ribs! The dim sum sampler is a pretty sight, but it's a bit too much to eat-as it's 5 pieces per serving for each pax. The tea pot soup is a delight, with thick chicken broth in the tea pot, accompanied by a dumpling and a fritter - it's tasty. We also had the egg-spinach dish and their empress fried rice. The rice has black olives added and it's a flavorful dish.
5
Food is satisfying with a good variety and mix. The menu combination is interesting and offers good breadth of selection to try and indulge in. It is friendly to foreigners with its set menu that offers the best of its menu. Restaurant ambience is excellent - relaxed and quiet. Service is attentive and friendly. Special thanks to Irene who took extra care to check our table when we left and ran at least 500m(!) to return something that we left behind
4
We visited recently for the second time. My first visit was for a work CNY lunch. The food we pretty good. We returned recently for a family dinner on a Friday night. The food we actually pretty good and came quickly. We had roast pork, duck, broccoli, beef, tofu lobster noodle and dessert. The only downside was noisy music outside (doors were open as it was a cool evening) which made it hard to head (not necessity the fault of the restaurant). Desserts also were a bit of a let down (more western than a Chinese) especially the Orh Nee which wasn't hot.A good venue for overseas guests. The venue is lovely and the view of the river is great.
4
It's a lot quieter and elegant than Boat Quay which is just across the river. Happy hours offers great prices on wine and beer, the dimsum inspired snacks are good too with the drinks.
4
wonderful place to catch up with friends especially after work or dim sum over the weekend.. food relatively good.. service excellent..
5
Some decades ago, was strolling here as a little girl with mummy and the feeling never ends, the feel of the river still lingers in the air.
4
Food was fantastic and the entire ambience was great. Restaurant was well-lit with natural sunlight - a really pleasant visit and meal!
5
A very impressive Dim Sum lunch..... lots of options and fixed price. We opted for the free flow champagne Option. Great location, great design, beautiful dim sum and no shortage of champagne.... definately out default Saturday hideaway.
4
LOCATION The view on Singapore financial district and Fullerton hotel is breathtaking. The restaurant is quite and peaceful. The terrace is spacious and comfortable. SERVICEIs average. Neither bad or good. Definitely friendly. FOODDim Sun and dumplings well prepared and tasty. Appetizers are also good. Enjoyed the sweet and sour pork a lot. Good wine list. I recommend it and will return. CIAO

Thankful to have been invited to lunch at Empress: Gem of a place in CBD.The East-meets-West decor and jazzy tunes made for a cozy ambience with an airy feel from the large windows over-looking the Singapore River.Thoughtful touches as stools for our handbags didn't go unnoticed. These stools blended seamlessly into their decor!We had the 3-course lunch. The starter had a crunchy har kow and succulent duck. The main course's fish was fresh and steamed just right, the kung po chicken's batter was crisp perfection and the hei bi rice was a lovely complement.Burbur cha cha is a favourite dessert of mine. I must confess that their version fell short of my expectation...it tasted more like a Red Ruby. However, the other egg custard bun had a good blend of tastes.The only drawback (for not rating it 5) was the mains coming BEFORE we had finished our appetisers AND the server squeezing our appetisers to put the mains on the table!Otherwise, a great lunch venue worth the $$ spent
3
The drinks menu is not extensive but decent for a restaurant cum bar. Finger food was pretty decent, and they offer a good variety of choices. Outdoor dining is very nice on windy nights. However if it's warm, they have fans for outdoor dining so that saves the day! Love the entire feel of the restaurant, both indoors and outdoor. Nice place to chill with files and a quiet dinner with good friends.
5
Had a weekend dimsum buffet to celebrate my bf birthday. The food is great, staffs service are excellent. Things are great as how my friends described it to me. What caught us by surprise is they serve us with a birthday cake which we didn't request at all! This shows that how attentive the staffs that are on duty today, as i only asked him to help us took photo with the birthday card. Empress you really exceeded my expectation!
5
Four of us enjoyed the brunch today. You choose your soup, three main courses for the table and pudding. After that you select the dim sum and then it keeps coming if you want more. We opted for the Mumms brunch. Our glasses were topped up generously. The food was absolutely superb. Delicate, different and delicious. Prawn and spinach soup and sweet and sour soup were so tasty. Different roast meats, crab and a variety of dim sum were excellent. So were puddings. Every dish was perfect and beautifully cooked. Lovely setting and helpful attentive service. Highly recommended and given the outstanding quality I think this is good value. We came here last year for lunch. Friends had recommended the brunch to us and I'm so pleased we visited again our our trip this year and tried the brunch.
5
Love this place!! Great setting in the museum with views across the Singapore river. Great value for money both the dim sum and free flow champagne. Very friendly staff and focused on customers. Also great for kids. Highly recommend this venue
5
dumpings and sweet and sour pork are a must try. we loved them. the location is perfect for any kind of occasion. only note is why outside they don'the use the same accuracy as inside in preparing the table (no tablecloth, no napkins, etc.)
5
Common dishes in common names, but prepared in the most uncommonly delicious manner, arrived in the most uncommonly welcoming environment. Will visit again.
5
Such a wonderful dinner experience (they serve lunch as well), with incredible views of the river and exceptional service. Highly recommend for groups, couples, families, and friends.
5
My girlfriend and I had the Valentines Day dinner. Food and ambiance was great. Waitresses were friendly and helpful in all aspects.
4
I was taken by a Singaporean friend. He wrote that he hoped I would have nothing against eating at a local restaurant. I thus expected to be taken to a very simple local restaurant, along the lines of what you find in some of the food markets. Much to my surprise, the restaurant is located within the relatively new Asian Civilisations Museum, centrally located and with an excellent view of the financial district and Boat Quay.I arrived slightly earlier than my host and took a look around the restaurant. Elegant decor and courteous service.We both opted for a 3-course business set lunch. I had a good Dim Sum platter to start with, followed by steamed lotus leave-wrapped Halibut, Kung Pao Bang Bang chicken, crab and baby shrimp fried rice and then Bubur Char-Char. At a cost of SGD 38 per person, I find that unusually good value in Singapore...Go there. Enjoy the view, and then visit the museum while you are there. It is somewhat small - but the Tang Shipwreck is a very interesting exhibition and well worth a visit in its own right
4
This restaurant serves fusion-Chinese food, with twists on traditional fare. Great location on the banks of the Singapore river. Tables outside or right by the glass-folding doors have the best view - tables further inside don't have a very good view. Food was very good, while not exceptional. Good place for business events with decent value-for-money set meals. There was a private event ongoing in one half of the restaurant on the evening that we were there, but service remained attentive and we did not have to wait long for our food
4
The Singapore foodies have created an eating scene that is not everyone's cup of tea, and rightly. Empress is for dinner a space with space, where you don't have to beg for a table. It's comfy, good wines almost okay-priced (but this is Singapore), music is not so loud that you can't talk. The tasting menu for two was not wowing, but contrary to some reviewers here I do not need to be wowed; very good is fine. And it was that - modern inner-Chinese fusion. Clear coconut soup and their house fried rice were even excellent. The price for the food, especially for dinner, bordered on low. Strange that no wet towels are provided at the beginning. Service was part juvenile part bureaucratic but friendly, and that is something. I would definitely go again for the kind of dinner I had
4
Our friends from Singapore took us to this restaurant and we walked out very satisfied. The view of the Singapore river enhances the ambience. It was a buzzy and busy place to dine. The food quality was very good and the service excellent. The waiter even used his mobile phone to arrange Uber for us as the wifi wasn't working. He even walked us out to the main road to catch the ride. What great service
4
Part of the Asian Civilisations Museum complex and right next to the river, this restaurant couldn't have a better location. It has a good atmosphere is a great place for a romantic, sundown meal. The menu is extensive and creative and there is a happy hour to boot. What more can one ask?!
4
We decided to give this restaurant because the ambience looked great. We were very pleased with the dishes too, which were beautifully presented. The ambience at night and in the day was pretty different, but we liked both.
3
I really liked the location with a nice terrace facing Boat Quay where you can enjoy a few drinks. Food (Chinese) is Ok but nothing to be thrilled about and the atmosphere has nothing particular.
5
The set for 4 persons was value for money. Excellent food quality. Yusheng wasvspecial with green vege. Like the steam Marble Goby fish. All staff were attentive.
4
Dinner was good but a little pricey. Service was good and the atmosphere was divine. If only the food had the wow factor.
5
I attended a wedding reception, and a smaller dining experience at this restaurant. The service was exemplary, and the food delightful. Well presented, aromatic, and particularly atmospheric outside on the terrace near to the waterfront.
5
Empress was one of the restaurants in the area that serves Asian cuisine with a style. While some restaurants will only sell the view and location, Empress certainly paid attention to their quality of food as well, which made it worth the visit. They had dim sum platter menu, just in case you have no idea what to choose
3
I'd love to say I'd recommend it in a heartbeat but the lack of service was actually pretty appalling considering it's under the Prive group. There are so many service staff on the floor but only 1 or 2 really understood what was needed. Sending out a Birthday cake my friend bought for the table in it's box and bag was out of this world silly. Cake eventually did come out with candles but not lit. Food took AGES to arrive and considering it's a lunch buffet and most of it just 'steamed' dim sum, we were quite disappointed at how long it took. Over the course of 2 hours, we maybe had about 10 small dim sum dishes arrive for a table of 4. We paid a total of 270 for 4 (3 buffets at $58++). I don't think it's worth what you're paying for and won't return until better service is promised. Shame really, great location, ambience and food just the service.
3
We went there for a family birthday celebration. The service was fantastic and full of personal touches. The food is Chinese but served in western style. The dessert was unusual- pineapple cake with pastry top. The location is unbeatable if you are looking for ambience. The riverside location attracts a good crowd dining el fresco but inside, there are lots of foliage and classic wood accents making our visit a very enjoyable one. Food wise, most dishes are well-executed
5
Impressed with the food quality, presentation and taste of EMPRESS and have yet to taste such great Chinese cuisine for a long time. Though would suggest perhaps to alert other diners whenever there are corporate dinner reservations on similar day, so allowing us to either be mentally prepared of the crowd and rowdiness or to make a choice for al-fresco dining instead
5
We booked ahead for dinner here, but needn't have bothered as it was very quiet, which is a shame, as the food was gorgeous and it wasn't a bad price at all. The staff were very attentive, and helpful. The restaurant is done out beautifully, but we asked for the balcony, which is next to the river. All in all a perfect, romantic evening, the best meal I have ever had on the Quays in Singapore (which can be an horrific tourist trap)
5
Great food, excellent presentation, service and veggie options. Well priced as well. Relaxed and great ambience. Would go back again
4
Enjoyed dinner at the Empress. The venue is ideally placed on the Singapore river for a relaxing meal.
The staff are helpful and the service is efficient.
Our meal was great and I was impressed with the imaginative vegetarian menu.
Prices good.
2
Totally not worth the price. Not much options. Limited portions on certain dishes. Most of the food came out oily. Siew mai tasted like those frozen ones you buy frm supermarket
5
Amazing place. Great service. Fantastic food. Good happy hour for beverages. I cannot recommend this place more!!!A++
4
They had good offerings for GF choices. Nice place.
Our guests were impressed with the food and service.
4
It is an elegant choice if you are around the vicinity, especially great to chill out after visiting the Asian Civilisation Museum. It has the great view of Singapore river, with both indoor and outdoor seating. We enjoyed our 3-course set lunch S$38++ with dimsum platter as starter, main dish is steamed fish, chicken drum-let with fried rice, and the shelved iced coconut dessert Bua Bua Char Char is heavenly! Service is attentive, ambience conducive and food is reasonably tasty. Highly recommended
5
Beautiful location by the water and very attentive staff. We ordered the set meal of 6 dishes which came up to about $70 per person, though once you had the service charge and GST, it became quite expensive. Food was high quality, though, and very tasty, with good serve pacing. If you're looking for a more traditional chinese restaurant experience with plentiful a la carte choices, this isn't the place. But if you're happy with set meals (with choices for each dish), this will suit you just fine. We had a bit of trouble getting to the place - the road system getting to Asian Civilisations Museum was very confusing. The person manning the Prive group hotline helped us as much as he could, but we ended up parking at National Gallery, and took in the spectacular views from the top of the building before ambling over the ACM nearby. Alternative is to park at Fullerton Hotel.All in all, a great experience and highly recommended
4
Good food. The service staff is friendly and the deco is fantastic. The number of staff is a bit shortage in the early hours when we reach . So the service is a bit slow, 1.30 hr later then got extra helper . This area need improvemen
2
This has one of the best locations in Singapore but little idea of how to make the most of it sadly.We went for lunch and amongst a handful of customers.The menu consists of pimped up Chinese dishes at pimped up prices.Our waitress was more interested in texting on her mobile phone than serving the customers.The manager also appeared to be totally disinterested in supervising the gormless staff.The food we had was mostly dim sum which was all disappointing with terrible char siew buns oversweetened and tiny in size. the Har Guao was ok.Overpriced craft lager was thin and flavourless.If someone with real flair ran a restaurant on this site and used the terrace properly it could be wonderful.Sadly this lot are just not up to it in any department
4
Went there to celebrate my Friend birthday! 7-8min walk from raffles mrt lol, not easy to find actually.. nonetheless the ambience is good! Elegant place service staff was good too! I unite crowded at night when I as there on a Friday night. Abit warm becos I was seatted beside the door. Food was good even tho it's pricey !! Try the dessert! Bo bo cha Cha was good and the mochi dessert! :
5
Food and serving staff were great, good selection of vegetarian dishes. Cannot wait to go back to try their dimsum brunch buffet! :)
5
Beautiful views, delicious contemporary Chinese food and reasonably priced for a high-end restaurant setting.
5
Lovely view of the river. Food was excellent- the salted egg tofu and fried brown rice are especially delicious.
4
Relax seating with view on the river. Nice choice of excellent and original dishes. The Peking duck was among the best ones that I got. Also nice wine card. Very competent and friendly staff. I will come back.
4
This used to be a Vietnamese/Indochine restaurant, but not longer so. Seems to be more Chinese cuisine oriented, but really good, although my wife is less Chiese kitchen oriented. We took the 6 course menu, which is quite filing. If you don't like pork, the entree is probably a bad start, but I loved it. Very special teapot soup. The noodles Har something as a 5th course is a bit strange and stuffing you up. Great dessert with dates and ice cream. Nonetheless, this was a good final after 3,5 weeks travelling all over the Far East. Yes, we would go again, both for the location and the food
5
Enjoyed the wonderful service by Fabian and his team(especially the young man at the beginning of service) on 5 Nov, Saturday's 11am session! Thank you. Your hospitality is very much appreciated. You guys and the fantastic quality dimsum made our party of three very happy people on a Saturday morning. Will be back and hope to experience the Empress hospitality again.An area for improvement would be the portion of certain signature dishes. For instance, the char siew and roast pork would have been more enjoyable with twice the portion served
4
We had a wonderful evening at this restaurant with friends. I wasn't sure if I was going to like it when I first read the menu as it seemed a more unusual selection to that which I've seen before at Chinese restaurants. However, everything was delicious. I can particularly recommend the teapot soup and the beef cubes. Also, the vegetables in garlic sauce was delicious. My husband had the sticky date pudding and said it was divine. I think we confused the restaurant a little as apparently, as the waiter explained, the dishes were for sharing and we were ordering one for one in a traditional Western way. However, I've marked it 4 stars rather than 5 as I felt the portion sizes were rather inconsistent. For example, my husband's appetiser of duck salad (which again was beautiful) was enormous and could have been shared, but there is no way you could have shared the teapot soup which was definitely meant for one person only. We were also encouraged not to order vegetable accompaniments as we were told it would be too much, but we found we needed them anyway in the end. I would definitely come again, particularly now I understand the menu a little better
5
Organised a birthday lunch for a small group of friends here. Love the view of the Singapore River. The interior is beautiful decorated, not stuffy but chic and very charming. Love that you can have tim sum set lunch and they are beautifully plated and you can choose for it to be served as a platter or individually. Everything was delicious and the choices for dessert was interestingly varied, like Panna Cotta with local taste. They even give you a take home Madeleine. Nice touch to end of lunch. The staffs were kind to rush the lunch as some of us needed to get back to work. They also do executive quick lunch! Made us wanna go back again soon.
5
We chose the empress Dinner menu and really enjoyed it. So many delicious things we could try, and everything was cooked very good. We all enjoyed the dishes very much! The price was good if you consider the view and the quality of food. I only can recommend the empress Restaurant!
5
Wonderful to sit out and enjoy the river and a refreshing breeze in Singapore. We did the shared menu (S$55/pp). It was plenty of food and we enjoyed every dish. Some were more creative than others (e.g. the teapot soup), but all were good.Host who seated us was a bit of a jerk, first not acknowledging that we had a asked for an outdoor seat and then refusing to turn off the obnoxious fan blowing on us. Waitress nicely helped with latter and the rest of the night was wonderful.I'd go back again
4
Cozy environment and good food although portion not much, hehe! Is a birthday celebration dinner for my wife, thank you EMPRESS warm prepare of birthday dessert.
2
Great view and outdoor atmosphere. Poor service and overcooked food. Fantastic potential - but not well used as the attention of the staff and the preparation of food was poor
3
Ambience was great, service so so only. The price is considered very expensive as it is not really fine dining.
5
This restaurant under the Prive group brings a breath of fresh air to Chinese cuisine. With a nice ambience and breath-taking view of the Singapore River, it is a great dining experience for tourists and locals alike.
3
Overpriced, food not interesting please look into the how the make the food to taste better and if not the restaurant will close down
4
Let's start with the location. You have to get a table with a view over the river to the older buildings nestled along it, and the modern Singaporean skyline tearing up behind them. Quite spectacular. On to the food. Again, this is very good and a match for the view. Portions are manageable, well cooked and presented. The stars in our selection were the lobster in chilli sauce (not too hot on the chilli scale) and the sticky spare ribs. Quite a low key vibe to the place and relaxing for a quiet evening out. Well worth a visit and a leisurely stroll afterwards.
4
Ordered har gar, seafood spinach dumpling, deep fried tofu with salted egg, aromatic duck salad, and duck and prawn vermicelli rolls (highly recommendable!), and happy about this meal. Enjoyed a table with a view of the Singapore River which further improved the quality of our meal experience. Service is warm and polite. Eaten here three times previously, and see myself returning
3
Dinner for two with service and no alcohol came to S$170.We had the cheapest of the set menus. It was OK. Not great, but OK. The soup was probably the highlight. The main course was probably a bit on the light side, I could certainly have eaten more (and I am not a big eater). Service was perfectly decent, and the location is great. All told a pleasant but forgettable meal. Nothing wrong with it, but nothing to make me want to go back either
5
Traditional Chinese dining sometimes lacks a certain sexiness that French or Italian cuisine might have. More often, Chinese restaurants are somewhere you go for dinner with your folks, rather than for a first date. Empress, however, might just change your mind – the latest addition to the Asian Civilisations Museum manages to be just as valid an option for date night as it is for reunion dinner.Taking over the premises from IndoChine, the flashy, colourful chairs and purple lights have been retired in favour of more subdued, modern furnishings. Wood accents, greenery and subtle Oriental motifs help avoid the clinical feel that we find ourselves becoming so familiar with. The museum’s original façade serves as a backing to the full-service bar, and full-length glass windows are employed to take advantage of Empress’ riverside location. We can’t deny that the décor here would suggest a menu teeming with modern interpretations of Chinese cuisine, but it is, instead, traditional through and through. Chef Ricky Leung, whose forte is traditional Cantonese cuisine, helms the kitchen, offering his 26 years of experience like a seasoned pro.Our tasting began with a plate piled high with golden brown deep-fried tofu cubes ($10, $15, $20). The soft tofu worked wonderfully with the richly flavoured salted egg yolk, generously sprinkled onto its light crust. The king prawn dumpling in supreme broth ($14) that followed was just as rewarding: a single, large dumpling filled with tender prawn and pork served in a stoneware bowl of surprisingly thick and umami-laden broth
4
Located near the river next to the civilisation museum, in a beautiful building, the place was relatively quiet mid week. It was very relaxing. They have a really nice selection of fresh dim sum and I would recommend the bubur chacha for dessert. The service needs improvement but if you're not in a rush you're in for a lovely evening.
5
Went here for lunch with friends. We ordered a la carte. The roast pork was incredible. The sticky plum pudding dessert was exceptional Well worth a visit.
4
Lovely location in a historical building with friendly staff. Had the dim sum lunch buffet. Great value and the option of having either wine or champagne with it is a nice touch. The setting is perfect for a relaxing long lunch.
5
Very delicious dishes, dim sum combination set was of good quality, excellent tea. The manager was extremely friendly and helpful, even got us information on where to buy their tea! Seating is nice and quiet, enjoyed the stay and will come again.
5
I would just like to express my gratitude to your restaurant particularly your staff for the amazing experience that me and my family had while we were visiting Singapore. I was on a family vacation trip and we decided to find a place to eat for dinner right by the Singapore River to get a serene vibe of the area. We got there a little late and was seated in the outside which is definitely what we wanted. The lady that served us was really great. She was very accommodating and well-spoken. Rose was able to bring us the right food and made sure if we were good and satisfied with it. I personally loved the roast duck and my dad enjoyed the Angus beef. At dessert, Rose suggested the Filo Pastry and sticky date pudding and both dessert were just heavenly. All in all, we are appreciatively of the service as well as the food and I would absolutely recommend it to my friends and family who is visiting Singapore too. Thank you so much

Reserve a table outside which are the hardest to get. if it's too warm you can then always opt to move inside. Food is beautiful Chinese with a contemporary twist. The restaurant is at street level with a great view across the river to Boat Quay and part of the financial district. You can also go there for a drink - we nibbled before dinner on perhaps the most incredible calamari I've ever eaten

Went for dinner with business colleagues. It was a lovely night with a nice breeze so we sat outside which capitalises on the view. It is a great setting. We had a set menu and all the courses were very nice. Emphasis was on lots of different tastes and small servings - perfect. Good variety and quite inventive. Service was friendly and discreet. It's not cheap but not much is in Singapore. Overall I'd be delighted to go back.

The 3 of us had the 38 and 58 set lunch. The food was pleasant n the place is very nice.The fish paste noodles and the roast pork and the fried rice was very good. The portion for the 38 set is just nice for us. The 58 had a few more dishes. The desserts of calamansi Creme brûlée n egg tart was very interesting.The service was quite prompt.

Great to see a new restaurant open in this lovely spot. We used to love the Indo Chine and were very disappointed to see it close. Really enjoyed the Royal Peking Duck (much better than the Duck Dinner we had recently in Beijing). Service was good, food excellent and the outside location with a view of Boat Quay just what we wanted

Was looking forward to try this place as the place look gorgeous. The ambience is very posh looking, bright lighting.What are lacking here are two most Impt things to me that will attract me to go back - food and service.We order the 58 chef special set lunch. Start with a dim sum platter which is normal, the porridge I will say is nice and interesting. The main are prawn, pork belly and fish with rice. Honestly I feel like I m eating a boring cai fan the way is presented. And the prawn is ok but the fish and pork belly are just normal.Maybe is the expectation but this is supposed to be the chef specialSet, shouldn't it have more a wow... Nice... Factor?? There are tons of restaurants in town, if the special is not special, don't think it will attract repeat customer. But maybe I should have order for the alacarte but the restaurant is right at business district, set lunch will be what people generally order.Next is service. Of course I saw some friendly happy waiter around but just unfortunately the waiters serving our table seem a bit impatient. Firstly, we are a mess ordering the drinks but with the last repeat, the order is still wrong which is no big deal. The problem is the frustrated look that is very obvious. When the waiter serve the dim sum platter, one of the spring roll fall on the table from my boss plate. The waiter just leave it there. I am a bit surprise that they didn't do anything at all. My boss then have to pick it up and put it on his plate back. I was so thankful this is not my client plate as I will he embarrassed if he put it back on the plate when the waiter did nothing. This is a fine dinning place, is this not part of the training of at least asking Ur customer if they want to change? The gap between the main course come a bit slow which I ask the waiter to check the order which she said they have chased. No issue. The last course, ice cream come slightly longer as all my guest start to ask me if we are waiting for the dessert. I ask the same waitress if she mind checking the dessert, she snap and say she chased already. I was shocked with her reaction and my guest besides me look at me with surprise too, asking me why she sound so irritated. The overall 4 courses lunch take abt 1 and a half hours. So I am very unimpressed. This restaurant is new and they should know people share their experience especially on a new place so food and service must be good...otherwise why would people go back?I bought my Impt client there to impress them but lesson I learnt, never bring Impt client to a place U never been before as now he has an impression on the place but not a good one I think

Great relaxed setting right on the river, nice view of boat quay. The service was great, bar staff were attentive and constantly available. Happy hour is good value. The bar snacks were outstanding, delicious and different to what you would get elsewhere. A highlight was the salted egg deep fried tofu. Will be back for sure

We had our Valentines dinner here. It was our first night in Singapore, we had a lovely evening and enjoyed the special evening menu.

We went to Empress with a group of 15 pax. The ambiance was nice, but the service was a bit too slow. It was a bit too pricey for the kind of average Cantonese food offered. I will not go back again.

We dropped in for a drink and their offer of some BBQ meat with a drink order. The cocktails were nothing special. Pricey but not memorable. The BBQ pork that they served us was ridiculously small. I know it was a promotion but seriously, it was almost coin sized. Despite reviews raving about the BBQ meat, I didn't find it anything special and am unlikely to try their restaurant. The decor was lovely and the bar has a lovely view over the water (although there is a sidewalk between

My girlfriends took me there for my birthday and we ordered the executive lunch set for $38/pax. It was a 5 course meal and we added a peking duck to our meal! I thoroughly enjoyed our set lunch, it was set really delightfully and it tasted great too. I feel that it was value for money for a restaurant at such venue. Location: Very convenient if you're taking a train (get off at Raffles Place station)! A little less if you're driving. You will have to park at National Gallery (newly renovated, gorgeous!) and walk over to ACM. It can be a little challenging to walk over in the Singapore heat. Interior: Love love love love it. It has a nice mix of old and new which I love. The space is bright and airy which gives a really inviting vibe. It almost feels like we are not in Singapore.Food: As a new-ish restaurant, they've some good promos like an all-you-can-eat dim sum buffet for $58 and different set lunches that will fit different budgets. The ingredients they used were fresh, lovely plating and good portions. You have to try their desserts!!! They're so good. We had their "Not so Portuguese Egg tart" which was like a deconstructed egg tart - It wasn't overly sweet and really tasty. Service: Attentive and welcoming. It's my first time having a caucasian slice my peking duck for me at a chinese restaurant ;) We also ordered the peking duck which was a miss for me, hence I reduced my overall rating because for such a classic dish, you either make it or break it. The crepe was too thick for our liking and I find the duck overly greasy. I'd recommend this place if you want Chinese food with a modern twist. It is not crazy on the pocket and very value for money. I'll 100% recommend it

Struck by the modern and classy Oriental décor, I thought the restaurant made excellent use of its location and view by keeping an open feel. The set dinner turned out to be a lovely culinary adventure as the appetizer platter was delicious, as was the hearty tea pot broth, crispy cod, e-fu noodles and interesting dessert of a coconut custard in filo pastry

Had recently dinner w my Husband and a Friend at Empress. I must say the restaurant is located at one of the best places in town. You have the view onto the river and the skyline of CBD. Inside the Chinese deco is very tasteful and beautiful. For dinner you have a choice for a set menu or a la carte. We choose a la carte as we were not so hungry and it was a wise choice. The food was amazing, every dish was great, but the king prawns were my absolute favourite. So if you need a really nice and classy Chinese restaurant with not the regular noise and w a breathtaking ambience...this is your choice. I will be bac

During my visits to Singapore, I always like to 'discover' good places to eat.So I do know many. But it is always a great pleasure to find a new 'gem'!The one that is a little bit more special and stands out!Empress is just that ! A very pleasant surprise!And that comes from somebody who isn't even a huge fan of Chinese food..Combine your visit to the ACM with a lunch or dinner in the Empress and you will not regret it. In any case I am looking forward to go there again sometime soon

Overall, a most pleasant restaurant experience! We had a variety of dimsum and a short order for lunch (7 or 8 orders in total for a food bill of 53SGD), and sat on the counter (as the restaurant was fully booked that day). Service was warm and well-trained. The interior was elegant without being stuffy. The view of the Singapore river even heightened the meal experience. Highly recommendable. Will return

Such a pleasant visit. The food was fabulous, better than our favourite Tak Po in Chinatown (hard to believe I say this, but hey, it's a different price league). Mellow jazz playing through the lunch made for a relaxing setting. Service was impeccable. И если вы говорите по русски, Виталий и Валерия помогут вам почувствовать себя extra special. Highly recommended
