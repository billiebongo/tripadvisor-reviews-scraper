Enjoyed the Thai dishes here which are modern with a touch of fusion. Perfect for people like me who can't deal with the traditional spicy levels.

located right at the escalator but need to walk a distance from elevator. staffs were friendly. we arrived earlier and they allowed us in. food was serve prompt. the tumeric lemongrass chicken was delicious. however the chili that served with it was in a small tiny cup which was a very downside. ordered morning glory tempura as this dish was seldom found in sg and i ate before in thailand. considered costly for this dish at >$10++. there was no background music so kinda dull ambience.
1
Unpleasant dining experience, food was overpriced and serving was little. Our total bill came up to $65 with just 3 of us and one of the biggest mistake was the tomyum truffle fries. Mild taste of truffle (even though restaurant claims that they uses high-quality truffle oil) & the Tom yum tasted like MSG powder from Maggie noodles. Serving was horrifying little and zero effort in plating. Highly unlikely to dine here ever again.
5
Sumptuous Thai Cuisine with a modern twist at reasonable prices in the Orchard Road shopping belt. Decor is modern minimalist. Food is served fast. Waiters are courteous and helpful
4
Although over priced, the food is Delish. Good gathering place with friends. Do try the soft shell crab
4
At the 8th floor of Center Point, this Thai restaurant offers a decent selection of dishes, seafood, meats with vegetables, noodles or rice.Reasonable pricing for main courses between 10 and 24$.A good place for a quick and tasty lunch 
4
Food is good and good for big group of friends. service is good as wellbirthday occasion is suitable
4
Was at Som Tam Orchard Central for dinner with my spouse and son. Ordered the Xmas Sharing Platter which was meant for 4 pax. Portion was a bit small than expected. However, the pineapple rice, fish, seafood and green curry were good and yummy. Service staff were courteous and attentive.
3
Som Tam is not a typical or traditional Thai restaurant. They have added ingredients and offered in presentation or names of French, Italian and even Japanese, which is quite interesting. However, the standard of service needs to improve, after browsing the menu, no serving staff approached us to take the order, and instead, I saw them chatting endlessly at the counter until I went to alert them
3
Other than the tuna salad and grilled fish head, the rest of the dishes we had were just so so....the spicy salmon roll was very dry and tasted terrible.
4
The staff were very attentive and the foods were delicious. Best for sharing and try different foods
3
Phad thai and Som tam were pretty much average. Actually I would prefer Thai Express or absolute thai. Thai food is good as it is, I doubt the fusion concept her
4
This was my first visit. The food is nice, service is good n the price is consider not too xpensive
3
Menu was interesting but many items were out of stock and it was only 630pm before the crowd came in. Food was decent.
3
Was at restaurant on Sunday evening 6.30 pm but when we wanted to place orders, a number of items were sold out such as roast duck red curry, some beef/seafood dishes. Restaurant should be better prepared to stock up on popular items especially during weekends instead of telling diners that particular food choice has run out. In the end, we just had olive fried rice which was delicious and seafood phad thai which was just ordinary
4
Plenty of food choices, many fusion food such as tom yum pasta or tom yum truffle fries. The chicken tom yam was not bad, abit on the sweeter side. Pineapple fried rice was good and the salmon tom yum pasta was good, but quite spicy. Garlic fried chicken was not bad but small portion. Thai milk tea was good. Use Eatigo to make reservation and get discount
4
If you are feeling adventurous do give this place a try however the taste is a pretty acquired one especially for the carbonara and tom yum aglio olio.
5
This place is truly a hidden gem â€“ its location at one end of level 8 of Orchard Central, behind Kiseki, is rather unfortunate, because it does not get much traffic. But the food here is authentic, delicious and easy on the pocket. Definitely worth a return visit!
3
No doubts over the authenticity of the flavours but pricing wise was slightly tad overDisappointed when we ordered the Thai Parfait and most of the core ingredients were unavailable, end up it's like we are having Matcha Chendol instead...
3
Had lunch there with friends. Food was above average. However service was a little slow. Seems like they were understaff even though it was a sat afternoon. We waited at least 20 minutes before food was served
3
went with family. quite nice food. will consider going back for a second time. good to try! good service too.
3
On weekdays, the promotional sets are quite OK in terms of value for money. This place is right at the end of the long building on L8- just keep walking right to the extreme end (towards 313 Somerset). Because there is no signage, you may wonder if you should be heading the opposite direction after walking for a stretch.
4
Foods was nice and was served in a nice displayed. However, there is only 1 or 2 persons on the floor serving the foods and cashiering. Services tend to be slowed.
4
Visited with my husband. We ordered the duck curry, olive fried rice and a basil minced chicken. All dishes were very good. Only thing that was lacking is that the restaurant did not seem to serve water and we had to go to walk over to the water container to pour our own water and yet we had to pay service charge
4
The food taste much better than I have expected. The food portion is rather generous for the price. Value for money
1
Ordered seafood fried rice and the squid was raw. Highlighted to the staff about it upon payment, only received 'noted'
5
Love their food. Up to the standard for Thai food. Planning to visit som tam again. Will recommend to my friends.
4
Love the tom yam clayfish and fried squid. Olive fried rice is nice, just a bit dry. Overall recommended
5
This is a busy restaurant because the food is great.Our choice for dinner was chicken satay skewers, Morning Glory tempura with curry sauce and prawn Phad Thai. The food was fresh and perfectly cooked with delicious sauces.Service was friendly and professional and the food was served quite quickly.It was so good, in fact, we returned the next day for a late lunch and had the chicken satay skewers again (so delicious), mango salad and fish cheeks. We were delighted.Highly recommended
4
My first time eating there. My wife gave me a treat :) We ordered Tom Yum Truffles Fries, Olive & Chicken Fried Chicken, Kaneng Phet Ped (Thai roast duck served with fragrant red curry) and Morning Glory with Thai curry dipping sauce. The food was delicious!Recommended
4
Nice Fusion Thai Dishes..Black tom yum soup was not that good..Other dishes were mighty fine!!!!!
5
The foods there is up to standard and comparative with what you have in BKK.Staff is attentive enough and food serving time is quick
3
I guess the food portion depends on chef's mood. same dishes served with different portion. I can understand dishes may look different from menu photos but some dishes are way too far from photos. good point is they have self service ice water. restaurant is located at a corner, i didnot experience busy hour so food served fast. yet the food tasted like pre-cooked even for french fries. i would not recommend to thai food lovers. There're lunch set menu too, price and photos look reasonable. Thank you
4
Som Tam offers very affordable thai fusion cuisine in town and we were surprised and satisfied by the food portions and quality! The Lemongrass Chicken was well marinated and delicious, while the Tom Yum Truffle Fries could have done with more tom yum and truffle seasoning
3
The food was only average and the price was quite high for the standard of the food. Service was average as well. Nothing to shout about
5
Visited with my Husband and toddler. There was some non spicy dishes suitable for the young one - .We had the:- salted egg pasta with sausage 8/10- beef steak 7.5/10- salted egg chicken with rice 8.5/10- tom yum Koong 8/10 (can be spicier)- basil chicken 8/10 (can be spicier)I will definitely return again to try the Som tam :
5
The food are authentic, delicious, nice presentation & value for money. The place is in central location.
4
The restaurant was nicely decorated and food was served promptly. Taste was good Abd we enjoyed the meal
4
Located on the 8th floor of Orchard Central. A new approach to Thai food. Very good food at reasonable prices. The service was efficient and friendly.
4
We tried 3 dishes..love the Tom yam beef soup most as serving is generous with tender beef slices. The fried chicken wings have nice lemon grass taste. However fried kai Lan was bit too salty
4
food is average, service is prompt, good location, but wont go there just for thai foodthe somtam i ordered was good, tomyam not sour and spicy enough, thai basil was very average..price on the high sid
4
innovative and tasty fusion thai dishes...tried the carbonara pasta, som tam, pad thai...all were very good..
5
I was very impressed by the number of Food choices. The seafood was very fresh and delicious. i will go back again.
4
Food is nice. Tried the green curry pasta and phai Thai. Wanted to try the charcoal toast but did not had the luck as it was sold out.
4
Had the olive fried rice, som tam salad and oozy chicken as usual. Standards still remain good. But the chicken in the fried rice could do with more marination.
4
The chicken wings, fried rice, tom yum goong and THAI milk tea was very good and tasty. Dessert was on point too
5
If you are craving for Thai and western cuisine, choose somtam. They do served thai burgers and Tom yum French fries.
1
Not sure if the kitchen had an off day, but I've never had a burger so pitiful."Rice patties" were used because they were out of bread, which was fine, but no effort was made to grill it into actual patties that don't disintegrate on contact. So it was like eating a plate of rice, rather than a burger.And the worst part - I ordered a tom yam prawn burger, and the receipt said so as well, but no hint of tom yam flavour could be found. So it was a plate of rice and plain grilled prawns (no sauce), 2 slices of cheap cheese, with the usual lettuce and tomatoes. For nearly $20. I would have asked if they got the order correct if I wasn't the only diner at that time.It was served with a side of fries. Very generous serving, but it couldn't make up for one of the very worst 'burgers' I have seen
3
Menu has very wide range of variety and the set lunch were good and worth the $$.But we were disappointed that few orders taken were out of stock! Key visit was to eat the 'After You' toast or chacoal toast but didn't get to fulfill the urge. Other than this, the visit was good
4
Chanced upon this restaurant last week, and was quite annoyed with the service at first. I think they were a little short handed on that day, cos it was quite crowded during dinner time. We almost walked out cos nobody was free to take our orders. But I'm glad we stayed. Ordered about 5 dishes, thought the food was quite fragrant. It had the wok taste for some of the food items which took me by surprise cos I didn't rly expect this standards from them. Overall the food is good and I will definitely come back. The salted egg chicken is my favorite!
3
Not impressed, waited for 45 minutes, no service, only after I flagged the waiter down, as I was getting ready to leave.It was freezing cold, lucky I had brought a cardigan, because it had rained. They were out of coconut, also watermelon a guest on the next table wanted to order. My Thai iced coffee I had to mix myself, that was a First.My seafood glass noodle dish took another 17 minutes to arrive. The dish had 3 mussels, only two open plus one large one small prawn, I had to take the shell off, but no utensils except for my fingers. Another 10 minute wait for soja sauce.The dish tasted ok, but nothing special, except for the price. Offer, free desert for a review on Tripadviser. I left to not return
4
Must try the som tam, very nice and clean. But for the nam prik, it is abit too pricey and not worth ordering.
3
I came here for a quick dinner before proceeding to Takashimaya for some last-minute CNY shopping.I ordered a Tom Yum Pasta, which arrived shortly. It was simple, but with an additional dimension of umami flavour that elevated it above the typical tom yum pastas - was it fish sauce? It was delicious.I can't rate it higher without trying out more items on the menu, but you can't go wrong with that Tom Yum Pasta
4
The family enjoyed our stay, however, the burger patty was slightly overcooked. We were looking forward to the flying fish bucket but after checking with the staff, realised the menu was overhauled. Extra Compliments to the Tomyam Fries! even order twice
5
Great food...love to visit once again..place is nice, price also affordable for any types gathering..I would highly recommended to all Thai food lovers
4
We had the squid ink tom yam, and grilled chicken lunch set. Squid ink tom yam was nice and interesting. For the grilled chicken, we noticed that it wasnt thoroughly cooked but staff replaced it immediately for a new one without any questions asked. It was well marinated, and the lunch deal was value for money as it came with salad, dessert, and a drink. We were also very impressed with the wide array of menu items available. Overall a pleasant experience, we would come back to try other dishes
5
Great customer service. Relaxing experience with a good ambience for a place to gather. Great food with no expensive prices.
4
Service was good. Food was good. Reasonably priced as well. Will be coming back. Green curry pasta is a must try.
5
Definitely a worthy trip. This is the Fourth time i have came here in a period of less than 6 months. After the first trip that I made due to my attraction for its ambiance, the food proved worthy for it to be a good hangout spot that I am never shy of recommending to more friends and family members to come forth together
4
Relaxing experience with a quiet ambience for a small social gathering. Food was great and generally neatly served
5
Excellent olive fried rice and truffled pad Thai- the ambience was great too! Lemon infused ice water was a nice touch.
4
Food is good, thai fusion food. Great variety of choices. However it's always understaffed. But great experience and will come back again
5
A semi self service bistro serving modern Thai fusion. They incorporated Japanese, pastas into Thai food. We ordered the Thai laksa with chicken thigh and green curry laksa. The Thai laksa is my personal favorite and the portion is perfect for a guy! And most importantly, it is affordable! Will come back again to try the other items.
4
Good tasty Thai fusion food at a casual environment. Good for simply family and/or friends gathering/outing.
3
Very nice food but Staff not understand the food in detail, every little request have to check with kitche
4
very nice and interesting food. lovethe tom yum black. only complaint would be the surface of the bowls are too big, turned out the food get cold easily.
4
Food was good, we had the salad with beef (Tiger's Tears?), the Krapaw Gai and the tom yum soup. Tasty food and good serving size.They even had 3 temperatures of water. Cold, warm and hot. I found it a nice touch.Overall it was a nice experience
4
Delicious thai food, especially the Tomyam soup and laksa. Food serving is sumptuous Try the matcha latte too.
3
Crew seemed shorthanded on a Friday night but we can see that the crew is trying their best in handling the crowd tho they missed out on 2 of our items & also, mixed up another 1 item. Overall, food is not bad but felt that the morning glory tempura is too oily. Tom Yum soup is not very spicy & sour as I thought it will be. Tom Yum chicken wings were deep fried very nice, but it was abit salty on some parts of the wings & not very obvious tom yum taste. Will go back to try other stuff on the menu.Items worth trying: Seafood Tom Yum Koong, Roast Duck in Red Curry, Morning Glory Tempura & Mango with Black Sticky Ric
4
Food was good, very for money.Service slightly falling short, might be due to the crowd or manpower shortage.
5
Tucked in a cozy corner on the 8th floor of Orchard Central - it certainly was a hidden gem! The atmosphere, service, hospitality and the food (especially the desserts!) were great! Awesome Thai food with a twist. Absolutely loved the Tom Yum Truffle Fries
5
Looking for something Thai at OC. Offer an extensive range of Thai Fusion offerings. Prices were reasonably priced, despite being in the Orchard area. Staff were friendly, especially the female service crew that attended to us
3
Service staff should put on smiles always. Never put in effort to repeat what customers had ordered until told to do so. No greetings or thank you after payment was made. Saw the staffs pushing each other to attend my daughter when I asked her to get some chilli for me.
4
2nd time in 2 weeks at somtam. We really like their oozy chicken, somtam and seafood garlic fried rice. Ordered the chicken basil fried rice on our 2nd visit - rice was flavourful but chicken needed longer marination. Can skip the pad thai.
4
Good recommendation. Cost casual environment. Would have been great if they had offer a discount as well on weekends.
3
Since it's fusion so it lack the authentic Thai food taste & overall food quite average. But their Oozy Chicken deserve a recommendation thou. It's different from other normal salted egg chicken which is wrap in a creamy wet yellowish salted egg sauce, instead it's consider dryer & there are bits of salted egg white which goes very well with the chicken & rice
4
Nice thai food and great service but wasn't crowded on Monday night. The coconut freeze was good! Pad Thai and seafood fried rice was good too. Didn't try the Tom yam soup, maybe next time!
3
the food is not in small portion as we ordered 3 main courses for 2 pax and could not finish. Yes, i will visit again
4
Food was pretty awesome, it was my first time there. Service is quite good too, the waiter made some recommendations since it was our first visit. Nice and cosy ambience, will go back there
4
First time to Som Tam though I've patronised Gin Khao (under the same company) previously. Food was good at both places- tasty and served quickly. They were very generous with the fries that came with my kra pow burger. 2 mains + a soup for 2 people was more than sufficient. Would definitely return if I feel like having thai fusion food
4
Everything was okay, but I guess it was short-handed that night. Overall was still a good experience
5
Visited on a Friday evening via Chope (simple and fast) reservations. Variety of fusion food. Ordered the beef burger and pastas. Portion is good and the chilli packs a punch. Truffle fries can improve.
4
 A nice modern place, when I entered the restaurant, it did give me the up market feel. Later browsing through the extensive menu, seems that it was an affordable place as most dishes were less than 20 bucks. Go for the 'Som Tam', should be around 6. You get to mix yourself. Do not forget the milk tea, you will not go wrong with that.
4
Good food,, reasonable prcing, value for money meal for family and friend gathering.. Surprisingly, this restaurant seems to be under rated...
3
Green curry was good, lots of cabbage served in big chunks in almost all dishes and beef salad was awkward to eat
5
It was my first visit to Som Tam. Being a restaurant that serves fusion Thai food, every item looked so enticing to me. There were 2 of us and we ordered Gai Tod (deep-fried chicken with Thai garlic) not so complicated noodles and Deep Fried Chicken with Creamy Salted Egg Gin Khao Rice with a sunny side up. The fragrance of the Thai garlic went well with the fried chicken while the salted egg chicken was a little too salty. I will definitely be back to try other dishes
3
The decor is nice. I thought the food was just average Thai -- in fact I have had better at several places in the USA.The air conditioning is too strong (I caught a chill and needed hot tea aftewards) and they have an over-loud soundtrack of sappy pop music.Service was good
4
Tried the Tom Yum Talay and Red Curry Beef. THe Tomyum had a after-taste spicy punch, not too bad! Red curry beef tasted like green curry but was a joy to have. Service was good. Nice place to hang out for dinner.
4
had tom yum soup with tang hoon. there was ALOT of tanghoon for additional $2. chill place. suitable for all occasion
5
Not too crowded, nice and clean setting. Very good and tasty food. Recommend the fusion pasta with Tom Yum. Som Tam is also a must
3
Was there with wifey on a saturday afternoon. It had a casual but comfortable dining atmosphere. Service was good too. We had the garlic seafood fried rice and pad thai. The fried rice came with 2 huge and succulent prawns, and some mussels and squid. Nice!! Just that the rice itself was a tad too salty for me. The pad thai, for me, was a little too sweet; definitely not quite to my liking. Anyway, we will be back to try out their others dishes. Hope will be better next time
4
It was my first time trying Som Tam and I liked it very much! The menu is refreshing. Food taste good, portion was just nice and the price was reasonable especially for the $10off on visa cards. T&c apply
5
You have to try the oozy chicken. It's salted egg yolk magic. The Tom yam pasta was also very tasty
3
Food was served fast.Staff are knowlegable and are able to introduce dishes in details. Overall,i find the papaya salad most appetizing
4
Thai Garlic Seafood Fried Rice - Feast of seafood (Fresh of frozen shrimps) are quickly stir-fried with/tossed in Thai garlic & onions and flavourful Hom Mali rice
4
Visited Som Tam with some friends for dinner. Nearest MRT will be Somerset MRT station, walk 5 minutes to the restaurant. Open concept restaurant no privacy. No round table. Friendly waiters and waitresses collect orders and food served. After meal, settle the bill over the cashier counter. Average food at above average prices.
3
The concept of thai food fused with other is really interesting. The som tam and mamuang is definitely a good one. Tom yam was more of the sweet side, which isnt to my liking. The rice was undercook. But, I have to say that the ambient was pleasant.
4
good place for Thai Food. Find their Tom Yam Soup "Syoik" , something i will go for in my second visit. Tried their Green Curry Pasta as well, It was nice, something different that you hardly tried in other thai restaurant
4
Attentive staff. Portion is big enough for 2 to share. Tried phad thai, green curry and fried garlic chicken. Food is favourful enough for people who like strong flavouring. Will go back to try other food next time round
5
The service and the food was good. I love the Tom Yam soup, and even the chicken satay was superb. Also available are fusion food like Kimchi Beef with Rice. They don't have my favourite Lemongrass drink though
