Excellent. Do order the Shiok maki.
Also recommend the Foie gra BBQ.
Ramen is not great.
Good service and sometimes they take reservations.
4
We are regulars as it has a wide ranging menu that means all family members can find something they like. The 4 of us have plenty to eat and usually get out for around $100. Asparagus, chicken wings, sushi rolls, lamb with garlic all good.
5
The foods are delicious! The sashimi, the SHIO Sushi. I love it. But you need to queue for a while and sometimes if it’s full u must share table with other customers. But worth to try!
4
Have been visiting this place for a few good years now, simply love their 'Shiok Maki'. However, I have to say that the standard has been dropping in recent years.
5
We read that is normally long lines to get a table herre. We where lucky and got a table right away. Sooo fresh sushi and sashimi. Everything that passed our eyes looked great. And it even tasted great. You find this place at Wisma Atrium shopping mall at Orchard road
5
Had a late lunch here and there was still a crowd waiting to get in. Tip: have patience and queue if you want to have some really good maki. Servers were working quickly to get things cleared away and to take orders. Tip: do know what you like to have, this can speed up your order. Many came in to order their different types of maki, but I see many ordering their bento as well. Their Shiok maki and pitan (皮蛋) maki are one of their many signature dishes.

One of my Favorite Sushi Place. The Shiok Maki is one of the item tat i always ordered. There also have some items that is not on menu. I found out when one of my friend is the frequent diner there. Yaki Udon tasted nice too although looks really simple. The grilled stuff also nice but depends on what you choose
4
Happened to pass by this place. I just needed a quick dinner with my son after therapy. It was about 8.30 pm on a Saturday and we were lucky to be ushered to our seats in 10 mins. I was introduced to the shiok maki. Oh Yes that really tastes great! And of cos we tried other food like the udon which is simply delicious! Will definitely be back again!
4
The restaurant is very accommodating to help arrange for us the oyakodon when we requested for it even though it is not in their menu.The "Shiok" maki gen 2 is a must try!Overall the food is nice and the price is good without causing a big whole for enjoying a feast!

By far not the best sushi bar in SingaporeFirst, you can not order from the sushi chef at the counter (no one Japanese), second the waiter does not know the name of the sushi in Japanese , third many sushi are out of stock not available , fourth the restaurant is very noisy, sixth the quality is so so, seventh the prices are high
3
the food:
- it feels rushed the sushi i ordered comes messy..
- like most of the restaurant some of food are great and some aren't
space:
cramped
3
A very centrally located restaurant in
A shopping mall at orchard road.
Love the unagi set.
Always crowded with office workers
And tourists. Better go earlier to beat
The office crowd.
Reasonable price n good food.

Been coming to this place on and off for the last decade. Patrick has been excellent as the chief sushi chef and has a good team off staff. Love the selection of food which is fresh and tasty.

Went at 4pm yesterday which was a public holiday due to hari raya. Server that took our order was great. Short haired lady who worked in a Japanese restaurant previously.Our shiok maki orders took very long to come. The table beside us got theirs even though we ordered before they did. By the time they had left, we still haven't got ours.Got another server to check on our order a couple of times, and all she did was say that there are a lot of food orders and ours is still waiting for the sushi chef to make.The last excuse she came back wth was that the prawn needs to be cooked cause they ran out of it.We order both shiok 1 and 2. When the orders came, guess what? The prawn tasted cold and soggy. And there was a big pile of tempura prawns sitting right outside of the kitchen window the whole time. So what was that about? I have been here a couple of times. Standard has dropped so much. My friends are big customers of wasabi Tei and it's their first time here. The tuna sashimi here is pale red in color and salmon is pale orange.If you go to wasabi Tei, you will know what I mean by the best in singapore. And their pricing is definitely very similar, just limited space. Freshness definitely guaranteed.Disappointed and I won't be back nor recommend friends back here anymore
3
Went here with friends in Singapore and tried out some dishes. Love their hotate dishes and shiok maki. Unagi is just a so and so. Average sashimi quality. Waiters were so tired serving here and there as the crowd was never diminishing over time. In my opinion, the pitan tofu is just overpriced and the taste isn't so good
5
I didnt really want to review this place because it is already so popular. The queue is amazingly long during dinner time. For those who wonder what the fuss is about....The Koh specials SHIOK maki is a must order item. Is not easy to describe...but there is unagi wrap in sushi and wrapped over with salmon sashimi...topped with a rich layer of special mayo dressing. Once place in your mouth,,,it just seems to melt and slurp down with glee.... Every friends I bring to try the dish...they want more. I dont know what more can I say but do order their variations of sushi. Each set is about $20 but the queue is so long so looks like nobody is bothered about the price. The other fried dishes like chicken and noodles are pretty ordinary so u may want to give it a miss. The place is somewhat cramped for my liking so cant say is comfy and is almost always crowded. Try to go on off-peak hours to really enjoy the sushi.Good luc
3
I had dinner here whilst visiting Singapore, an expat friend of mine raved on about Koh Grill endlessly so I made a reservation for a weekend evening, true to the hype there was a queue of around 15 people waiting on arrival. Ordered the reputable shiok maki, yaki udon, gyoza and mixed vegetables. I thought that the quality of the food was good, but nothing was outstanding or would justify such a long queue. I couldn't understand it, I was the only tourist eating there so it's clearly a locals favourite? I think my high expectations slightly disappointed me. I would however return as I did enjoy the food
5
The food was amazing, the mentaiko sauce is not to be missed. Just thinking of it my mouth is watering. After Koh's Grill, you're spoiled for life. No other Mentaiko sauce will ever be as good. This Mentaiko sauce will be the one that got away, the one that you'll be referring to when you say "yeah, this [insert inferior Mentaiko sushi] is great and all but not like the one I tried." Food aside, the lines are really long, but it's totally worth it. Sometimes you may not catch the staff's attention, but that's okay. The seating can get a bit cramped, but hey this is Singapore
5
I went there with my friend at 2pm for late lunch. By that time, the lunch crowd madness has died down and dining experience was pleasant. Their salmon sashimi is thick and tasted fresh. And shiok maki was just.. shiok.. overall it's one of the best maki I had in Singapore
5
Passed by this restaurant and always noticed a healthy queue despite the numerous other Japanese outlets in the mall. Had lunch here and ordered the Katsu curry, taking udon, ramen and sushi. The real clincher was the sushi although a bit more expensive than the other dishes on the menu but still worth it.
5
Must try the Monster Sushi. Simply delicious and they don't hold back on the sauce.
Love the Foie Gras BBQ
Quick service !
Ramen is average however good price.
4
The restaurant is strategically located in Wisma foodcourt - Food republic, near to Din Tai Feng. Must try the shiok maki. There is also freeflow of green tea.
4
If you're into maki than this is one of the best places to give a go on their signature shiok maki. The shiok maki just literally melts in your mouth and leaving you wanting for more. The downside to this restaurant is the queue time which took us 30mins just to get a bar side table as the place is always jammed pack, best timing to go is after 8pm if you don't mind going for late dinner and I believe there should be online reservations available if you don't want to wait. Overall it's a good place to dine for lunch and dinner plus the service is quite fast knowing that it's always busy any time of the day.
4
My family went there twice during our trip to Singapore! I enjoyed the sushi very much, love the sauce and condiments that go with it! The service is pretty good and very quick. We didn't spend too much time at the restaurant, and expect to wait in line if you go at prime times, 7pm onwards, best to head there around 6-6:30pm if you plan to have dinner there, as it won't be as busy
4
This is my second visit and food quality is still good. My friend and I visited on a Friday around 12+pm and there was no queue, so we seized the opportunity to dine here since Japan Town opposite offered more expensive meals and no juicy Shiok maki rolls that enticed us lol.I ordered a salmon belly soup while my friend ordered the unagi omelette. We also shared a Shiok! Ebi roll. I am 7 months pregnant and the waitress was concerned and offered to have our roll's salmon cooked longer (not fully) and promised flavour won't be ruined. I liked my roll!Food came without long waiting and it was overall a good experience
1
Nothing very attractive & special. Try once & it will be the last for sure! If you are a Japanese's foods lover you will understand after you give it a try. Is above the reasonable price for the food quality. The freshness of the ingredients was bad. Overall is a Disappointment.
5
This is one my favorite sushi places in Singapore as it is affordable and offers fresh and yummy (in my style is with lots of sauce) maki. Try out their signature dishes, they are loaded with ebiko and sauce on top. The service might be a bit slow as they only hv few waiters but its worth the wait
1
Their service was TERRIBLE. Waitresses were unhelpful and impatience.Asked few different waitresses to refill our green teas several times, yet all of them ignored us and we had to go get the green tea jug and help ourselves. Was wondering if they were trained to ignore customer's request.Will not visit again
3
Have heard of this place from many friends and relatives for their Shiok-maki. It was really above average but not really memorable. The grills were actually quite good but priced slightly steeper than usual. The painful part was the queue outside that really makes eating at this place a mediocre experience
4
Was there for a dinner with my colleague and we had to queue 20 minutes . Most of the time when you queue it's a good sign ! And that was true .. food was tasting and clean , price was absolutely reasonable ! Must try ! Buon appetito 
5
We were luckily to miss the long Q. Services are fast and food served promptly.
Their signature maki is excellent! Surely worth a try. I also recommend their grilled food.
Price is reasonable. Definitely will visit again!
3
The shiok maki and yakitori was good, the servers were like zombies though.. looked very disinterested.
1
Worst Japanese quality I have seen in a Long time. Not fresh and not well presented. Terrible service.
3
A very over rated place with queue line that stretches all the way to..."queue until you are hungry". The famous maki is not too bad but you can't eat more than 2 rolls, it is going to be too much. DONT waste time queuing seriously.
5
Would highly recommended. Price is reasonable. Just that each time the queue is always long.. Go earlier to avoid long queue.. :)
5
This place is extremely crowded during peak hours but considering the food and reasonable price, it's not hard to understand why. Definitely try the shiok maki. The staff were also helpful and are quick to keep the line moving.
5
We had lunch one day at Koh grill and it was amazing. We focused on the sushi menu and, besides their specialty rolls, also enjoyed various kinds of Sashimi, Sushi and hand rolls. Everything was super fresh, the fish of great quality and the preparation was excellent.We very much enjoyed this place and can highly recommend it. Also, it seems to be easier to get a table at lunch rather than at dinner
4
They serve delicious maki, sashimi, yakitori, etc. It was an enjoyable early dinner and the food was good. Place is a little cramp and be prepare to queue as it gets really busy and packed during dinner time. You will need to share table too. I recommend to go slightly earlier for dinner unless you like to have late dinner
2
Came for lunch. Maki and sushi took forever to come. The yaki soba was better than usual but it was not delivered when prepared and was left to sit on the counter for the longest time so it was warm, not hot, when served. Restaurant doesn't serve ice water. Must purchase bottled water. Disappointing all in.
5
please expect long queue during peak hours! rest assured the staffs are helpful in looking for the best sharing tables for all diners and is quick to clear the tables if food are finished. there are far too much "wanted to eat" food!! so in the end, our damage each is around S$38 but was really full and satisfied
4
Food has always been great. Love their shiok maki and all sushi were made to order. You can see how chef is dedicated to do his job. Free flow of hot green tea complemented everything. Service wise is just ordinary.
4
Been here several times before. Their service staff are friendly and food is fresh. The spicy salmon roll is nice and we enjoyed the flounder sushi. Ended up with some sashimi...uni, akagai and aji.
5
Shiok Maki never fails to disappoint me once again! This time, I ordered their grilled saba and it was so tasty! The meat is succulent and fresh, and the bite on the crispy skin made me crave for more!
4
Will definitely be back for more! Had the fried rice, udon and some maki-s with my friends after work. The maki-s left me wanting for more.
5
Every time a friend visit to Singapore, I am sure to force this into their itinerary. Was recommended to me by a friend and now I'm recommending to my friends. Although they do not have the best service (which I can understand - imagine from the time you clock in, you never stop until the shop closes. Not forgetting facing ridiculous customerS, can be very painful), but the Shiok Maki is a must, must buy! A tip for you: If you are to take away, you don't have to queue. The long queue is for dine-in. I've been through that. Stupid of me eh? :
3
'Shiok' is a Singapore / Malaysia colloquial term for fantastic and 'maki' means roll in JapaneseI'm mostly here only for its Shiok Maki & Saba FishCan't go wrong for Saba Fish. As for the Shiok Maki, 1 plate is not enough for sharing but 1 plate to yourself is too muchWhen I'm here alone, I'll usually only order the Shiok Maki and nothing else! It's really good! Must be the combination of roe, avocado, salmon slices on top and the torched mayo!! It's explosive!! But once you approach half the serving of Shiok Maki you start to feel sick from the mayo. Nevertheless, it's worth the try. You'll see every table order it while the chef is busy working on endless plates of it! Be prepared for the long queue thoug
2
LunchBeen hearing about this place for some time. Not quite sure what the fuss is about. Its not value for money, service is average at best and food quality is not that fantastic.We tried the Shiok Maki.....its a roll smothered in sauces. Its not horrible but kinda overkill. The yakitori was expensive and disappointing, overcooked and dry. Only thing that stood out was the pork cheek and Foie Gras. Sashimi was average as well.Service is average if you manage to get their attention.Overall?....still scratching my head on why people found this place good
3
Everyone who has heard of this koh grill confirm has tried their Shiok maki.. Shiok maki is a grilled sushi. I just had it again this week. Always the classic 20-35 minutes of waiting time. If you are only 2 people is easier, share the table with whomever. If you are a large group, longer time of waiting. To me, the food is great. If you are a fan of sushi, and you happened to be in orchard area, you can drop by and have a try. I went there to try most of their sushi. Shiok! Maki is one of the must try. I had some sushi all related to fish. Hot Ocha and a family i dont know to share the table with. Shiok maki is a sushi roll with salmon and unagi, after they rolled and add their special sauce, they grill it. The sauce that they give is generous enough. They also offer the quite economic bento box, also a lot of varieties. They range from 12-18 dollars. Salmon, ebi furai with rice and fruits to go with.
4
Located on the highest floor within Wisma Atria, the Koh Grill and Sushi Bar is located opposite the drinks stall within the food court. I highly recommend the special sushi items especially the shiok maki from Koh Grill and Sushi Bar. Their legendary shiok maki is truly in a class of its own with generous slices of salmon sashimi wrapped within fragrant japanese rice and glazed with mayonnaise...each piece of sushi is quite a mouthful.The grilled items are average so I wouldn't recommend ordering them here. (IMHO the Japanese grill bar in Meridian Shopping Centre is better and more value for money)Service is quite efficient but it could be hard to get the waitress attention as it gets really busy during dinner time.Because this restaurant is very popular and they don't accept reservations, going there early to queue is a definite must! PS: We queued for about 1 hour from 630pm on a Wednesday night to get two seats, just to give you an idea how long the wait can be
5
Shiok sushi. My personal fav. Generous portions. Love the shiok maki gen 1 & 2, pitan maki, California maki. It's the best because the roe etc is given generously. Flavor is intense and really nice. The shiok maki also has their mentai sauce. Just finishes the dish perfectly.
4
Had a very good meal here one evening. All of the sushi was very good, and the cheese and bacon asparagus were especially good. Good value, good quality, would recommend here to anyone.
4
We went at the peak of lunchtime and it was very busy and hot. Some of the dishes ordered took ages to come but it was worth it. We had a mixture if sushi and sashimi with other bits and bobs. Very good value for money
3
Glad to have made reservations and skipped a queue that seemed at least half an hour's wait.The best seller here would be the "shiok maki" - which we concluded was named so as it was topped with a very rich cheese/cream sauce. However, I would say that preparation of the food was very production-line like, and as a result the food was not all that "shiok" (Singaporean phrase for "satisfying"). Plus point was that we didn't have to wait long for the food.As the place was very crowded, it took more than 3 tries to catch the attention of the service crew. We had to request at least 3 times for our tea to be refilled.Would probably not visit this place again
3
Famed for its "shiok maki" but it just isn't quite shiok enough. The sauce was definitely shiok but the mid section of the maki wasn't cold.Went during lunch and there were rows and rows of maki prepared and left on the counter awaiting roasting and drizzling of the shiok sauce. The supposedly cold inside of the maki was left to warm.If the maki were made upon ordering, it should garner a higher rating. Pray there isn't too much "leftovers" from lunch if you visit in the late afternoon
2
Portions are small and do not give you value for money. We had the Shiok Maki, Avocado Salad and the Chirashi. The Shiok Maki tasted good but it looked messy. The Avocado Salad looked very basic for the price (thus not worth the value). It was just iceberg lettuce, two cherry tomatoes and a few thin slices of avocado. The Chirashi was the only dish that looked and tasted good (but it was expensive). They don't serve cold (tap) water. We found the food expensive. It is better to go to another place for Japanese food. Doesn't mean that when it is crowded, it means it is absolutely good
5
What a find! Incredibly delicious food. This is really gourmet sushi. I am running out of adjectives for the service, food and the ambiance.You must try Patrick Tay's creations...sushi , grill and desserts. Don't hold back on ordering..you will be pleasantly surprised when the bill comes
4
Good stuff I tell you, we celebrated my sisters birthday there and I have to say they do serve awesome Don with fresh ingredients, my favourite have to be the Piten Tofu and I ordered twice just to make sure I had my fill of it. Come with a empty stomach and head back filled. Keep up the good food guys, yet to try the Maki that people rave about as we are stuffed
4
Ordered original koh maki, shiok maki, eel maki and seafood fried rice. The memorable taste are koh maki and shiok maki, strong recommendation!The place was in a food court, so space was limited and was noisy. Payment system was slow though. Staffs were not attentive in refilling the green tea. Even when trying to get a staff's attention, it was very hard to get them. Need to queue for sometime before get a table (time was about 9pm already!
5
Good first experience there with authentic sushi, a good variety.The food was fresh and very tasty... One of the best sushi place I've been so far in Singapore.I recommend to book a table because the queue is very Long and the restaurant packed!!!If you are looking for privacy, this is not the good place! But honestly when the food in your plate is amazing, who really cares about privacy!
5
Undoubtedly serves the best maki in Singapore, Shiok Maki lives up to its name indeed. Its other items on the menu are also delicious and everything is reasonably priced. Only downside is it's nearly always crowded and you have to queue, but food is served very quickly and definitely worth waiting for
5
The sashimi is nice and fresh. Sushi and handroll also so delicious ^^ I love the food here, the only thing I hate it's the queue were always so long :( long wait in order to enjoy the foodie here.
4
Very crowded on weekends and the queue can be too long. But their specialty sushi roll is really one of the best especially if you like you rolls worth mentaiko and mayo. Plus it's not very expensive.
5
Reasonable pricing . shiok maki is a must try. Althou it took awhile for our order to reached due to high demand. But its worth it.
1
Sushi wasn't fresh, sauces were bland, service was poor and to top it off, there was black hair in my sushi...yuck! Will absolutely not be back, better luck with Itacho Sushi or Tanuki Raw, among many other options in the Orchard area.
3
We quite like this place as it serves up its version of Japanese food. The century egg making and the shiok maki are staple must have of this restaurant.The sashimi was served in nice thick slices and was of decent quality. The grilled food was alright but it does lack the fragrance that you get when you grill food over a proper charcoal fire. The yaki soba and garlic fried rice were also pretty nice and decent. This place really does serve up very decent fare. Much better than most of the terrible food served up in other places here.The ambience though leaves much to be desired. It was noisy beyond belief making and dinner conversation impossible
5
Shiok Maki, first and second generation, is a must-try!!! Frist generation is a type of sushi that has charcoal grilled eel wrapped with salmon and topped with a special sauce which is sweet and appetising. Eat the whole piece as it will melt in your mouth!Whereas for the second generation, it is also a type of sushi but is crispy fried ebi wrapped with lightly roasted salmon. Once you eat it, you will want to ask for more!Apart from Shiok Maki, my friends and I ordered seafood fried rice, Bento J, cold noodles, and some other ale carte on sticks eg oysters coated with cheese.Peak period will always have a long queue so be prepared to queue or wait to taste the Shiok Maki! When it gets very crowded, the staff might forgot to serve you some dishes so do inform them that a particular dish is not served
4
The best thing about this place is their famed Syok maki. unagi rolls covered in mayo then seared with a blowtorch and toppped with a generous amount of tobiko. They have a second generation version of this made using prawn tempura rolls. The unagi wins hands down in my opinion. I preferred their old style with a thicker mayo but applied more sparingly. These days its a thinner consistency mayo and overkilled.Other things to try are the asparagus wrapped in pork, full of smoky garlic flavour but can be oily. Shio maguro, butter fish marinated in special soy sauce mix. MAKE RESERVATIONS! I cant stress this point enough as the queue can be crazy long
5
Don't know why it took us so long to discover this place. The menu was interesting and extensive. The quality of sushi was superb and it was also great value. Will certainly go back again and again. Our friend and guest is a sushi addict and global traveller, he was also very impresse
3
we ordered1. Sashimi2. Shiok maki3. Salmon soup4. Pork belly with enoki mushroom and garlic bitsSashimi was fresh and thickly sliced. However, the board the sashimi was put in was worn and dirty looking. It was still wet. Accompanying daikon was limpid.Shiok maki was shiok! But have at least 4 pax to share as it can be cloying given the generous amount of mayo.Salmon soup was decent and amount of fish head was generous.Pork belly was well grilled and tasty. Unfortunately, the mayo was just too much and killed the dish.Place was busy but kudos to the extremely quick servic
3
Arrived at 9pm and the restaurant was still full on a Thursday evening. They allowed us to sit at the food court itself as it wasn't crowded there anymoreWe ordered 7 different rolls and they were mostly ok. The standout was the one with century egg paste. The rest didn't wo
4
I ordered shiok sushi with unagi inside. I really love it. Also the mix between thousand years egg with sushi, it's so melty in my tongue. You should come earlier or the queuing line becomes so crazy.
5
Have been here many times and will always come back. The shiokmaki (1st(eel) & 2nd(prawn) generation) is a must-try. (I always have the 1st gen!). Will come back many many times!
4
Came here a couple of times just for the Shiok Maki and the other sushi rolls. The standard has always been there, and the Shiok Maki is a must-try! Downside is that service isn't fantastic though and some of the staff are not very friendly. Also, the food is a bit pricey to me. Do take note that if you do go during lunch times, it will be a really long wait. So a non-peak period like morning when they open would be better
4
good japanese sushi and grill stuff. the signatures are not cheap but the quality more than makes up for it. staff made it very easy to make reservations and it was a pleasant dining experience throughout. i will go back again! Note* there is no service charge for here
5
I simply like Japanese and was introduced to try this "different" Japanese restaurant at Wisma Atria. I was overwhelmed with the creative infusion of simple ingredients to make non conventional food dish. A must try will is the century egg tofu! The tofu was served frozen cold and the century egg sauce covering the cold tofu, melt in your mouth, and you probably wanted another mouthful of it. The price is affordable for these delicious dishes served.Look at the photos posted and you won't want to miss out having a go at this place
4
This restaurant is tucked inside a food court in Wisma Atria. The restaurant is usually full, so do come before the usual meal times. Food wise, this restaurant is famous for their creative Shiok Maki - a maki with aburi salmon, mentai, unagi and many more. It melts instantly in your mouth, hence the name of Shiok Maki. You may want to google what Shiok means in singlish. I also like their sashimi. Cold and firm, always fresh and cut in thick slices. They also have a range of other sushi and teppanyaki option. Don't forget to try their foie gras sushi! Overall, I hope this restaurant moves to a proper restaurant. This place is too cramp. I am literally listening to the gossip of my next table throughout the meal. The cheap plastic plates also don't do justice to the good food.
4
As usual, shiok maki 1st gen was delicious. I tried Pitan(pi dan) Tofu, and now it is added to the list when i go to this restaurant.Salmon sashimi is also fresh and good. Can hit 5 star when their service improve to have a personal touch.
2
Today is my 3 Time here and really feel disappointed with the food quality & services....the waiting time was long for food....that's why I have the time writing this review while waiting for my order. It's a Japanese's Restaurant??? Correct me if I read their restaurantt name wrongly! The lousier Restaurant in Japan at least still border to greet you & show you your seat....but this “food court” Jap Restaurant is unique! You DIY! Guess every business being too good will decline in Service & maintain it. This for sure is my last time here! Confirmed! Don't believe me, try yourself & confirm it...take it as donation.
5
Probably one of the best sushi shops I've ever been to hands down. This is great for a quick sushi fix as food is reasonably priced and the shiomaki is great. It's probably not the best place to come for quality service but food comes fast and the sushi really is amazing. Would definitely recommend this place for lunch or a casual dinner
5
Located in the food court of Wisma Atria on level 4 is this unique Koh Grill & Sushi bar. Famed for it's "Shiok Maki" and reasonably priced sushi is the main reason why there's always a long queue. They do take reservations though, which is the solution to skip the queue, so plan ahead!1. Shiok Maki $16.80+I love the little eggs on the maki and they are generous with the eggs. The sauce isn't just drizzled over the maki, it drowns the maki in a sweet and thick sauce, which helps the eggs stick onto the salmon. The slightly burnt salmon adds a slight "burnt" taste to the maki. Personally, I enjoy a charcoal-rich diet so this is the right taste for me. For some, it may seem strange2. Shiok Maki Gen 2 $16.80+The main difference between Gen 2 and the original Shiok Maki is the prawn. Both sushi are wrapped in slightly char grilled salmon. The eel is slightly sweeter and hence, it is usually the more popular choice.3. Ebi Tempura $10You get 4 big prawns in a thick tempura batter, served with the tempura sauce. The prawns were crispy, even after turning cold, they were still just as crispy. I enjoyed the tempuras.4. Enoki Buta Maki $3+The sauce on this is what makes it so awesome. Literally a sugar overdose sauce is drizzled over the enoki which had been barbecued. This is also one of their popular choices, which has been highly recommended by Koh. Sadly however, I find it pretty normal. Yes it's good, but it's not fantastic 5. Yaki Udon $10+I loved this yaki udon, a lot of egg and chicken. It tasted just like the yaki udon I ate in Japan. The sauce that the udon was cooked with was slightly sour which is compensated by the egg, which is slightly sweet. The udon was chewy and reasonably soft to enjoy.6. Seafood Chaahan (Fried Rice) $10+The "wok-hei" in this dish was overwhelming. I could smell this dish, before the waitress even served it to us. There were 5 big fresh prawns served in this dish, and the fried rice tasted heavily of garlic. So beware if you are planning to meet your date after this meal.7. Salmon Sashimi $8+You get 5 thick slices of salmon sashimi. It was fresh and it melted in my mouth! Mouth-watering goodness!Koh Grill & Sushi bar doesn't charge the 10% Service charge, even though there is actually really good service. But they do charge 7% GST on top of their prices listed in the menu.I really liked the Shiok Maki, which I will definitely be back for more
3
We went for a post lunch hour service, got seats immediately and the service was rather quick. The sushi and grill both were delicious, Shiok Maki is a definite must try!
3
We were lucky to get seats when were there on a Saturday for lunch. Service were fast. Food was average. Tried the Shiok maki (first generation), very interesting combination. Each mouthful was filled with flavours.
5
This restaurant is Very Bush with locals, so Executive a long watt to get a table, but the waiting time is worth White:
Great sushi prepared fresh Right before your eyes and at Very reasonable proces

Even though Singapore service are usually average, but the service here is below reasonable. Menu need to get from the table beside ourselves, the waiter actually ask us to wait when we call him, the waitress took orders without smile...food is nice but not exceptionally good. Slightly upscale for the price quality without comparable service and environment. It is okay if you want a change the usual Jap chains menu but Iciban and Sushi Tei can do a much better job

"shiok" is a word in the Singapore local slang to denote a feeling of absolute bliss, and that is exactly what the shiokmaki at koh grill gives. generations one and two differ in that the first involves unagi (eel), while the second is tempura ebi (fried prawn). at S$16++ for 8 pieces of sushi, the price may be on the steep side but it's really worth it. order a serving to share because the signature flame grilled sauce might be too "gelat" (local slang again, for "rich") for some. also popular judging from the ever-filled tables are the hotpot, yakiudon and grilled items.started queuing at around 7pm on a saturday, got a seat for two near 7.45pm, food took around 20 min, left the restaurant past 9pm and there was still a queue outside

We waited for about 2 hours before finally getting seats for friends of 4. We have already eaten some snacks while waiting. The wait is disappointing.The food came and our mood changed. The sushi are awesome! Tried both generation of the Shiok Maki. Very nice!! Some things to note: Don't expect patient/friendly service staff, it's normal that they forget your orders. Be patient with the waiting time especially during peak hours.

Sincerely speaking,the food is delicious and worth.But my friend and I really had an very bad experience as the server there were very rude to the customers.Not only they missed out on the food that we order and when we query about it,they just answer us in a very rude way.I really hope that they can improve on the customer service

Everytime I feel like having Japanese food I'll consider Koh grill and the sushi bar at Far East. It's typically very crowded at Koh and the seats are all cramped together but everyday there's a long queue for seats. You can beat the queue my texting them for a reservation.Everything we had was superb, from thick juicy salmon sashimi to beef sukiyaki and soft shell crab handrolls, the food was fresh and delicious. Not to mention the shiok maki that they mass produce in plates of 10 at each time with the delicious mayo sauce!!! reasonably priced, about $70+ for 2 people and we were stuffed, I think it's more value for money than say a sushi tei which might vary in their quality depending on the outlet. I'd be coming back when I next need my sushi fix. It'

If you like California rolls, then this is the place for you. I particularly recommend the "Shiok!!! Maki" ($16.80), which is a heavenly combination of charcoal grilled eel wrapped with lightly roasted salmon. Also, there is the "Shiok!!! 2nd generation maki" ($16.80), which is Crispy prawn wrapped in lightly roasted salmon. Their special mayo sauce on the sushi makes it the best sushi I've had in a very long time! BUT make sure you book a table, or else the line is crazy long!!! You can book by calling 9180 3850. They don't have enough people working there, so don't expect good service

take a dragon roll concept (for visual examples: https://www.google.com/search?q=dragon+roll&safe=off&es_sm=93&tbm=isch&tbo=u&source=univ&sa=X&ei=2s9rU6ThMsWxuAS_9YHIBg&ved=0CCkQsAQ&biw=1242&bih=607), pour a lot of cheesy (literally) sauce on it, give it a cool name and voila. A sushi for the new generation (I'd say a very western dish actually).The Shiok Maki (version 1) is probably better than the 2nd version (both cost about $16-17). Both are based on the same concept - overload an already overloaded dragon roll-esque sushi with.. even more sauce, then top it off with a little bit of blow-torching.It does taste... alright. I can understand why reviewer after reviewer says it's the best tasting thing around. Perhaps it's because the dish is directed at tastebuds craving for thick cheese based sauces. I, however, found the shiok maki to be pushing the limits of sensory overload.After all, it just kinda becomes a mush-mix of strong flavours without balance.Oh, and there is average service

Decided to go try the food after hearing so much good reviews about this place. I ordered Tokyo Ramen and salmon skin and I thought it was only average. Nothing to be wow-ed about.

I am a regular to Koh Grill as I work around Orchard and I am as frequent as twice a week. I love the food no doubt, it is yummy and well made and so I bear with their atrociously rude service but today it went a bit too far. I sat at the Restaurant for 1.5 hours waiting for them to serve my sushi order after they served the initial Edamame and Miso Soup. I enquired twice but they never got back and the witress put me off with rude ignoring looks. The rest around me, even those who came in later were served but I did not get my order, is it because of the colour of my skin or the country I belong to. I was very disappointed and pledged myself today to never return. They have lost a lavishly spending customer. There los

My girlfriends and I enjoyed the famous makis. We preferred the Crappy Maki (softshell crab centre) because of the explosion of textures - crispy crab, soft rice, slightly crunchy fish wrapped round, and generous spread of crunchy roe. The shiok maki went down the throat nicely, with the soft eel and hollandaise-like sauce, but it was too much of a good thing.But the service. There's none. Ok, if you've any requests, ask the lady from China. She's very obliging. Chopsticks, tea, menu, she got it done. One other server's favourite line was "wait", after which she never came back. How are customers to eat without chopsticks at the table? Or dry parched throats and no tea? We had a grand total of one refill. The only time she attended to us was when we wanted to order more food. Money works I guess.Will we go back? Yes. The food's good enough. But I'll go back with heavily-tempered expectations. Or perhaps offer to get my own chopsticks, cup and tea in future

This is a restaurant in an Asian Food Court that has almost always long lines of people waiting to be seated. All the food was very fresh and tasty and the prices are very reasonable. We love the garlic rice, the udon noodles, the miso soup, the fried chiecken and the seaweed salad. Many people eat there sushi but we are not into it in general

Koh Sushi Bar always has a long queue, even on weekdays, therefore a reservation is highly recommended. There's no doubting the food quality. Everything is freshly prepared upon order. However, do try to just go for the sushi/makis and grilled items. The other items such as ramen are mediocre at best. Service can be greatly improved. The wait staff always seemed so busy that it takes forever to get your water cups refilled. Pretty annoying. Must try: Shiok Maki, grilled eggplant, grilled co

Food court in Singapore is not what we used to consider fast food...we were looking around for special food when I noticed this Koh Grill and I also noticed that there is long waiting and almost everyone is ordering the Shiok Maki. The kitchen were busy making them like crazy. I was not hungry but it looks like a must try dish so I ordered take away (very long line). It still took about 30 minutes to get it but it was worth it!! I defiantly recommend to visit the place at least for this dish

Must try - Shiok Maki and Pitan Maki. Shiok maki as it means. Simply Shiok!!! Pitan maki is good as the century egg taste is not overwhelming even for a person like me who does not eat century eggs. Other sushi are generally good too. The sashimi is also very fresh. The only drawback is the noisy environment and limited seats. So be prepared to wait or call reservations

Have been visiting this restaurant from 2007. Recently listed in local Singapore blog as one of the best cheap eatery and i agree. But since the recent online exposure the wait has gotten quite long during dinner time. I usually order the set bento box as i found best value. Try the salmon/trmpura bento or unagi bento. Also worth trying are the rolls

Honestly I've never had a bad meal here until today. Perhaps it was because the waitress was hovering to take my order before I was ready. Thus, I had to flip the menu a couple of times to find what I wanted. Then she threw her pencil down impatiently and then got another menu to help (why?). There used to be an order to the way things are served. The grilled items and then sushi and then the rest. Today, the garlic fried rice got dumped in front of me first because someone else had ordered as well. I wouldn't have minded it so bad if it had tasted of garlic but it had less garlic than what I would put in regular fried rice. That being said, I still think that they do the yummiest grilled foie gras on a stick ever. It's as good as those I've tried in pricier restaurants and I had four sticks of that at S$8 each. The lightly grilled aburi salmon sushi was lovely as usual too. I've had many good meals here before, alone at the counter when I needed a sushi fix or with friends. I've recommended it to many people as the place for value for money Japanese food. Service was excellent with certain staff who make great recommendations for fresh sashimi and sushi. Today the lovely person who made recommendations was in the kitchen and everyone else had no idea. Even waiting to pay took a while as everyone was busy until one of the chefs who realised I had been waiting came out to help. I appreciate the good intentions but wish that staff training and attitude were more consistent. You can't just depend on the boss and one or two knowledgable staff. Also, I can now get equally fresh and value for money sushi at places like Itacho sushi. One tip that I picked up today. I don't order the delicious shiok sushi when i am alone as one plate of that and I am so stuffed that I can't eat anything else. The guy next to me ordered a half portion. Now why didn't anyone tell me that was possible? What have I been missing out? Yes, it's still the place for good grill and sushi. Just hope that on the day you go, you get the nice and knowledgable staff

We arrive to this restaurant by accident as initially we wanted to go to the Food republic nearby but that-s probably one of my best accident :)Even if you have to wait in the queue once at your table you could envoy your meal.Shiok Maki (made up of avocado, unagi and aburi salmon) is definitly a must tr
