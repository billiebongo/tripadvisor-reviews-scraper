If you don’t mind Low class simple surroundings but good food, this is a good pick. Lunch is less than S$10.

They were certainly better previously.
Still like their Chilli.
Soup is tasty but have some hint of MSG.

Tried the Abalone noodles and Salted Chicken Spaghetti. The Abalone noodles are too soggy and taste is not so good from last time. As for the Spaghetti, the sauce is too thick. But the Salted chicken leg is not too bad.

Local salted baked chicken at its best. The restaurant is a simple local delight. It is open air and has no air-conditioning. It is quaint and reminds one of how simple life can be with no frills and fancies but just Good food. The spicy sauce that is served along with the baked chicken is to die for!

Came here for nights makan with my mate, here's the breakdown (Comparing to other Coffeeshops):Ambience: 3.5/5Cleanliness: 3.5/5Customer Service: 3.5/5Quality of Food: 4/5Value for Money: 4.5/5Our Orders:Abalone Mee Pok: 4/5Kampung Chicken Drumstick: 3.5/5The Good: Value for Money Mee Pok with abalone that packs a punch! The Bad: Dishes were good, just that overall it was the ambience and surroundings that made the experience more normal, we were alright with the ambience. Bottom Line: Would come here again once a while, has a novelty effect, interesting to try out the abalone noodles once in a while

The abalone noodles and salt baked chicken are popular items, which we normally order when we visit. They serve a combination of Chinese and western styled noodles , that includes spaghetti and chicken. Overall the quality and taste of the dishes are quite good but the coffee shop setting next to a busy main road just serves as a eat and go place . They have a few more food court outlets are Parkway parade and Ion Orchard , might just try them next time in a more conducive setting

Why? A question I asked after taking my first bite. The noodles were drenched with vinegar, although the texture was acceptable. I couldn't find value in paying 50% more for a regular staple dish. Don't even bother with the abalone soup, it gives soup a bad name. The al fresco dining by the road was not exactly romantic (Nor healthy) with vehicles spewing carbon monoxide. Oh well, very likely my first and last visit. Many other better options to expand my waistline.

The bak chor mee servings are rather small, but you can always add noodles with an extra $1.80 payment. The soup is a bit bland, but you can substitute for pork broth with an extra payment. The abalone pieces are the smallest you would have seen, but that means you don't have to fight chewing them. No waste for those who don't like pork liver, as there isn't any. I found the mee kia more springy than the mee pok. They just opened an outlet at ION Orchard Food Opera, so no risk of your mee being hit by dust

Craving for ‘Bak Chor Mee’, and came to this stall.This bowl of Bak Chor Mee costs $6.80! Comes with a skewer of 2 pieces of abalone and scallop, fish ball, a half boiled egg with a runny centre and strangely a piece of carrot! Maybe the carrot is to constitute a full meal complete with vegetables? The first mouthful was good. The other mouthful that made me happy was when I had the minced pork with pieces of pork lard! You dine next to the open road, with cars, buses and motorbikes zooming by and some irate drivers blaring their horns occasionally. Quite an experience dining here. I also had the salt-baked chicken. Really juicy, tender and flavourful. The chilli was also unique, tastes like 'tau cheo' (fermented bean sauce). It has chilli and minced garlic within. Tangy and spicy. . This costs $5.50

Tried the Lam's Signature outlet at the Cookhouse food court in the new Waterway Point mall in Punggol. The abalone noodles were pretty good, although the serving size was a bit small. The regular Lam's noodles were also good. Long queue but fortunately my wife has more patience than me
