Me and wife ate at fresh frog in Geylang to tasting fresh frog.
There are many kind of frog serve in this restaurant.
The frogs still alive before you take order to taste it.

We had our first meal in Singapore here and we felt so pleased that we had not had anything for dinner before this. I had tried this dish once, but the second didn't dissapoint me.

The opposite coffee shop is known for it's beef hor fan but I much prefer the seafood hor fan. Very good wok hei. Next time will try the frog leg porridge and oyster eggs.
5
We have eaten here three times and its just perfect for late night eats, hangover food followed by Durian down the road.
Probably one of the best congees in Singapore, still can't match Hong Kong but come pretty close :)

I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food despite not expecting much !! Would definitely recommend if you want a taste of the local fare...

Although the restaurant sells a variety of food their speciality is their frog porridge and is probably worth a trip to Geylang Rd just for that. My wife and I really enjoyed it and would rate it one of the best if not the best meals we had in Singapore.The only downside couldn't get a beer with the meal, have been going to Singapore for nearly 40 years once upon a time as soon as you sat down a big bottle of tiger or anchor arrived at your table, these days are changing some may like it, it may be a religious or cultural thing the non drinking but in a hot climate I enjoy a cold beer and miss it.Having said the above try the frog porridg

Geylang Lor 9 Fresh Frog Leg Porridge is the first to start selling in Singapore. They even have branch in Johor Bahru. Their frog leg porridge is the most expensive compare to other like G7 SinMa and Ming Hui. But yet is the most delicious of them. Is a must try Singapore local food.

One of my food list when im in sg. Sg street food always has the best taste, quality n cleanliness so far for me.I recommend this porridge to all my friend. Dont know how they seasoning the porridge n frog itself, everything just . U should try their fried oyster too.

Set up in whats known as Singapores Red Light districtGEYLANG is a few miles of local shops and Restaurants.Locals say Geylang has a touch of old Singapore charm.Quite a few Frog porridge Restaurants that do a roaring trade each lunch and evening.Has quite a village type feel with a lot of international foreign Workers walking around at night.Felt quite safe easy for taxis many cheaper restaurants and Hotels for the budget concious.Certainly a must see at night

There are few places left in Singapore where you can sit in a back alley in a legit red light district and chomp down on (one of) the best cuisine that Singapore has to offer. This is purely a no-frills affair so wear comfortable clothes and bring lots of tissues.Order the frog's legs porridge (the spicy version is much better than the non-spicy one) and pair it with sambal stingray, "gong gong" (some local mussel-like mollusc that is steamed and served in its shell with a really good chilli dip) and oyster omelette. Wash it all down with an ice cold beer. Cross the road to the opposite shop and order beef hor fun (noodles). They will bring it over for you

Known as signature food in this country, many foodstools sell this in geylang but i chose this to try. So delisous

Good food with great spice, had the frog porridge which was nice and tasty, as a first time frog eater.
4
The gong bao clay-pot frog very delicious and the Frog Leg porridge are tasty. it's famous at Geylang street food.
5
The porridge is quite good. We ordered the ginger frog dish, served with porridge. The service is quite ok, and served quite fast.

A famous local dish in Singapore. But taste is just average, not as delicious as the post here. Poor customer service as well. I rather to eat durian than a frog leg porridge.
4
This one is as good as the eminent frog which is nearby too. Dun forget to order oh chien aka oyster egg. Very nice too.
3
Yes, standard has drop. Frogs smallish. Gravy more watery than before. Still ok but not the best. Still crowded.
4
Nice texture of congee and frog leg. open till late night. Always visit this shop when come to Singapore. There are few variety of taste to be choose on. I do recommend the spicy one if u can take spicy stuff

This used to be my favourite frog porridge stall 10+ years ago. It is still good but not as good as before. I will recommend to go to Lorong 3 because the portion they give is bigger for the same price and nicer. The accompanying stalls like fried oyster and sambal lala used to taste great but now it is not tasty anymore.Anyhow, it is still worth a visit if you are out for an adventurous supper. It still tastes good compared to some other places, just not as good as it was before

Geylang 9 Frog is alway my Favourite food in Singapore for more than 10 years! Two times visited to this resturant in Phnom Penh, their staff services is horrible and rube! Dont even bother to serve us! We waited for 20 minutes and ask them third time any vacant table available ! No one seem to bother us ! I will not visit this restaurant again!
4
They serve traditional frog porridge but my favorite is fried frog with garlic, priced at $20 per portion, it's really good. They also sell other food like Bbq stingray, bbq squid, oyster egg omelette and drinks.
5
As always, the congee here is quite nice, the frogs are great!! I always go here light dinner then proceed to down the road to Durian desserts!

People said that you must try frog porridge at Geylang when you come to Singapore and now I have understood. It's kind of street food, simple and happy.The food was good. However i found it's difficult to speak English here.
3
This is a good place for a late night food. I tried the porridge, oyster, and sting ray. Food taste are allright but I still can find better one somewhere. Overall rate is good normal standard.
4
Came here with a local friend. Generous portions of porridge + frog leg in the clay pot. Frog legs were tasty, the sauce was savory with a spicy kick! Porridge, even when plain, was very good.
3
Good Taste but there are better and cheaper frog porridge in Geylang. Environment is a little dirty. One sometimes has to sit along the road side to eat.

I'm was happy to bring my family along for this awesome Frog porridge which my friend recommend me as I always eating at Lorong 17. I have five person, I reach here nobody approach me or ask me how many person instead I get a table myself. Sit down and was waiting to be serve but no one come to my table what I want to order, I call one of the server which he clearing table and he ignore me. But that day was like not much people, I'm fine with that. After I order the food, portion is not even 2 person share and I order the large one. Frog porridge, the frog I order 3 but it came like 1/2 only ! The porridge is so disgusting that looks like people vomit the food. The standard is really poor and I rather eat frog porridge at Lorong 17 than Lorong 9. Info for people coming to Lorong 9 Frog porridge, you will regret. Simply the food here sucks

Came here for the dinner with Singaporean traditional frog porridge. The food was delicious, homemade bailey drink was good too although price was a bit high and service was very slow (it took us more than 20 minutes to wait for our food to be served)

This store comes a long history...i ate it like 20 years ago... The taste still remain the same with savory sauce that makes you craze for more...i ordered 2 pot of frog legs with different flavors... Yummy...$20 for 2 pax...i also order the stingray next store at $12... Not too bad except the sauce is a bit dry. It's a shame that recently I am allergy to oysters.. If not the fried oysters with egg is a must eat even you visit the coffeeshop.

Wanted to try this authentic frog leg long long time ago as no opportunity to eat it.We used to eat at Chinatown but their service is no so good, hence, we came to this Lor 9 for the frog leg with ginger & dried chillies. Its fantastic and the gravy is nice.However, parking is always a problem and the environment not so good as near the roadside.If you want to eat there, wear casual and no regret to have it there
