the food is average and reasonably priced. The drinks especially the alcohol are at low price & the entire place provides the vibe for you to chill the whole night away. Great place to hang out. Highly recommended for a weekend drink party

Average food and poor service, but the beer towers are of good value (IPA is nice). Otherwise, the shots are very diluted though cheap ($1 per shot). Essentially you get what you pay for. Word of caution for Entertainer app users, they do not allow more than 1 offer per table, unless >8 people (not sure why they can change the rules themselves.

Michael's Bar & Grill located at 32 South Buona Vista Road. Ate at Michael’s 0n Saturday night it’s a Great place to relax. There menu offers a variety of dishes such as pizzas, pasta, grilled chicken and plenty of prime meats, as well as some damn good burgers and sandwiches. The food that we ordered was excellent, especially the burger it was larger than typically what one would find in Singapore. The Wine was reasonably priced. Overall very authentic American food. The service was excellent, we will definitely be back to try the other dishes

Like the lady who served us who was very friendly. We returned the stale draft beer and she exchanged it without any questions. The jalapeño poppers was good, pizza, steak and deep fried pork ribs were ok. Recommend anyone who wants to drink, just order the bottled beer.

Location is at west coast area. I have 50% so it's ok. Food is not bad. The spaghetti cream sauce with sausage is good. The baby back ribs is good too. The steak is just ok. Not to shout about. Service is normal. Ambience is more like casual neighborhood bar
