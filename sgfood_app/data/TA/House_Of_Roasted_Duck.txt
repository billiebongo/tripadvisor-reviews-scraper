Delicious Hong Kong roasted duck specialty with good price. They have two restaurants around Singapore. Very tasty!

The staff were friendly, but lacked focus. Its not a good look doing the accounts etc when customers waiting, or tables need clearing. Dined there twice, won't return. Food mediocre. Hats off to the cook who was very busy..

I enjoyed a quick and sumptuous dinner here recently. The roast duck and soy sauce chicken was delicious and the congee was one of the best I've ever had. I really like the shrimp dumplings too! Overall really good value for money.

My most favorite is congee with roasted duck. The duck skin is crispy and meat is soft. Price is reasonable. The minimum amount for credit card payment is SGD 20.

Nice meal of Peking Duck at a modest cost.
Most dinners 99% were local Singapore families.
Good service clean and efficient also cooks in full view which I prefer.

Porridge is very smooth. Roast meat juicy. Good place to gather with good food.
Roast pork is good. But char siew is a little too sweet and too fatty
Nice music too

We really enjoyed this restaurant so much we ate here 3 times in a week.
The Peking Duck was done nicely and served ready to eat - the sauce had a really nice flavour.
The staff's service level was excellent and prompt.

A small eatery just outside Buggis shops opposite rail station.very good shrimp dumplings,rice ,two soft drinks and of course the Peking duck with two different sauces. One served with heaps of wrappers , the other was just the roast duck. With taxes S $50.00 a really satisfying meal, would visit again next time I am in S/por

Shopping at Bugis Junction and found 'no frills' H of RD with very enjoyable Peking Duck.In fact with stops in Singapore going to Europe and returning we went 3 times to enjoy this friendly environment ... and Peking Duck of course. Found the service very friendly and got to know Lenny a bit as well as a great spot for an economic and quiet meal amongst 'locals'

Well it was my first day in Singapore, so I decided to try some local food, and this place was located on the street to my hotel. The place is small, but the food is delicious. I had Congee with roasted duck and Prawn Dumplings. I haven't tried congee before so I was very surpriced when I got this very heavy soap, but it tasted very good. The waitres was so nice, and humble as well, very service minded

Beware of prices on menu are not inclusive of gst and service charges as they are in fine print below the menu. Got caught at cashier.

This restaurants serves fairly average food. The roast duck was just so-so. The sweet plum sauce helps improve the taste a little bit. We also ordered some BBQ pork. It was decent but I've had better.

this restaurant serve very special roasted duck,not too oily, very tender, i think this is one of legendary roasted duct restaurant in singapore

The House of Roast Duck is in the Bugis Junction area and well worth the trip if you are looking for a very good, reasonably priced meal.
Their specialty is duck but they have much to offer on their menu.

We were past wanting breakfast in the Bugis Village when we saw the front of this restaurant. I love my dim sum! I ordered two portions of Har Gow (prawn dumpling), one order of siew mai with tobiko on top. Both were very tasty and satisfied my hunger entirely. Vern ordered Spicy Sze-Chuan Dumpling and although he started to break a sweat on his forehead he really liked it. He also had Barbecued Pork Noodle. Limited menu and drink selections. Very good service

This place is small and is just the place you need to get away from the hussle and bussle of Bugis st .The food is terrific servings are plentiful, quality is superb, the staff are helpful .If you stay at Ibis on Bencoolen have a go ,you won't be disappointe

And the tittle is not exagerating. Located near the bugis market and the bustling bugis crossing, this place is trully a gem. The executive chef is actually a veteran cheff from a well know hotel in hongkong - excelsior.I kid you not, you need to try the roasted duck, roasted pork (the salty one) and the soy chicken - skip the char siew. I tried a lot of hong kong roasted before but this place trully one of the best by far.Another tips: ask for extra sauce when ordering the plain rice - those brown sweet salty sauce on top of the hot rice is heaven! And they also got this ginger dipping sauce (the typical dipping you eat with hainan chicken rice) - you need to ask for more of this too! Amazing taste!This is one place that you need to try when you're in singapore. Seriously! I always visit when i'm in town.Oh and the good news is, this place is open until late night. 11 pm

Very solid place to eat reasonably priced Peking duck ($30 SD for a generously portioned half duck with pancakes and condiments). We ordered the half duck, the crispy pork (sooooo crispy, crunchy, and juicy!), and the duck & pork fried rice (I don't even like fried rice much, but I couldn't stop eating this one). This was enough for two very hungry, seasoned eaters...smaller appetites could probably just get two dishes if one were the duck. Service was very polite and efficient. Would certainly come back again if I lived in Singapore

Found and agreed with the quality of roasted duck, which came in$30 for half size duck. Enjoyed rolling them up with wrapper with sweat source. But other dishes that we ordered such as dim sum are ok or let's say lower than average quality that you can enjoy anywhere in SG. Congee was fine. This restaurant locates at the center of Bugis and that is why this restaurant is very noisy place to dine. Almost hard to exchange conversation within my family...So, if you need to dine in the center of Bugis and Peking duck is what you want, it it not a bad choice. But unless otherwise, I will look for somewhere nicer. ブギス駅に近く、比較的手頃に北京ダックを食べられるので悪くないと思いますが、北京ダック以外の点心料理などは平均点以下の出来と言わざるを得ませんでした。あと場所柄、大変にうるさく会話に苦労するほどです。こういった点を上回るだけの理由、ブギス中心部での食事、北京ダックを希望(?)などがあれば大ハズレではない店だとおまいます

The best congee one will ever have, even in HK its hard to find this kind of congee, the roasted duck, its the gem, hole in the wall restaurants in HK cannot even come close. We are always here everytime we are in Singapore, never miss a visit.
