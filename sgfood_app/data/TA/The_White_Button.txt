Food is not fabulous. Waiter is anxious to collect the dishes once your mains is done. Doesnt provide friendly ambient.

Was shocked when I see the restaurant but the foods was worth the price and it was serve Super fast. However, is abit hot because the air condition doesnâ€™t seem to work.

Staff are very friendly and willing to assist despite no service charges. Food quality matches the price of the food.

Prompt service and nice pasta at affordable price. Good place to hang out with a group of friends for gatherings.

Me and my group of friends enjoyed the food. Service was excellent. Server helped to place the birthday cake before bringing it out to us. Will recommend to go back again

Chance upon this restaurant on a Saturday lunch. It is not in a good location (8th floor) so there are probably less walk in customers. The food is good and they have an offer now for $10 mains and $15 set even on a Saturday. This is considered cheap in a place like Orchard Road. I like the chicken chop - it was tender and juicy. The Fish & Chips sauce even came with prawns in it. And the soup (clam chowder) was good too. Soft drinks came in cans and not the watered down version from some dispensing machine. Very good value (but it will be hard to survive in the competitive world of F&B here) so visit while its still there and offers are still on

I booked this place twice over the last 2 weeks to dine with long lost friends. The menu was simple and reasonable, except that the soup can be cold and salty. But overall, it was a great place to catch up with friends and also near the vicinity of the MR

food portion was slightly small compared to the price. ordered tomyum seafood but it pales in comparison to that from pasta mania in terms of taste, variety of ingredients and size. sauce it too salty as well. sister has chicken chop with mac N cheese and onion rings for sides. mac N cheese was cold, onion rings over fried and hard. chicken thigh was not to bad and had a nice grilled taste to it. service providers were polite thought. but overall, i might not visit again
