It was my third time there. The lemon meringue cake is highly recommended. Tastes better than it looks. Enjoyed the Green Pumpkin house brew as well.

There are two parts for this place, the bakery shop and the cafe. Bakery wise i like it. The green pumpkin bun is the signature, sakura bun and some others are pretty good. Cafe food is also quite nice. We had a beancurd green tea dessert, not too sweet, like it

We saw this outlet in Nex, Serangoon. We saw the price on their cakes, quite expensive though.We went for the buns, I like the Matcha Tsubu bun personally. The rest of the buns that we bought, white cheese, black sesame koshi and green pumpkin buns seemed normal to me
