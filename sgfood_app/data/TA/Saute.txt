I have ate at Saute for a few times. Most of the time I ordered the soy bacon cream pasta. The dish is pretty nice despite the weird combination of capsicum that does not work, however, I realise today, the sauce has been watered down. I do prefer the thicker creamier sauce instead of the the slightly diluted watered sauc

Vegetarian restaurant on the first floor up the escalator of 'Bugis Cube' mini mall. Lots of vegan options and menu clearly indicates dairy/eggs/nuts/spicy. Prices are pretty reasonable with most dishes about SGD8-12. Options include rice dishes, ramen, pizzas, pastas, and mushroom burgers. Lots of sides and desserts too.

Visited this cafe for lunch. Had spaghetti with pumpkin and tomato sauce as my main course. Loves the pumpkin seeds and mushroom in this dish. Ordered a side dish ie ork Luah - or oyster omelette. The main ingredients are mushroom, bean curd and starch. Not bad! But nothing beats the authentic oyster omelette.

Though the food is not fantastic, the portions were big for its prices. 2 ladies have to take hours to finish 2 main courses (charcoal burger set & pumpkin tomato pasta). Luckily we didn't order a side dish! You can sign up as a member by scanning some QR code and earn more points by telling the cashier your mobile number when you order. Self service for cutleries And sauces

Was my mistake for getting lost and not able to find the place ... I mistook Bugis Cube or Bugis Plus duh! I like the small cafe feel. It's cosy and service is ok. Self service however uncomplicated. Had golden salt fries which was nice. also portobello mushroom burger which they allow me exchange for charcoal buns. with salad and fries. fries was good and just nice with salad. burger is good :

Like very much the baked cheesy pasta and the tomato ramen. Other stuff too. However the best is the waffles. I have had waffles in different places in singapore including Gelate, and also in the US and Europe, but these are amazing in taste and texture, chewy and moist with a unique pastry-like crispness outside, i think there must be some rice flour mixed in? Best waffles ever. Comes in two flavors, charcoal (black) or buttermilk, and they may take awhile to arrive, but so worth it. With a scoop of premium ice cream... Even better. Getting a bit too popular now maybe, seemed quite full the last few visits, but they'll put more tables up in the corridor of the mall as needed, so wait is neber too long. Moderately priced

Came here today for a 2nd visit and opted for the ramen in miso soup. This came with an ice tea and cost only $10. Tasted pretty good too. My previous visit I opted for one of the other dishes and was also quite impressed. Service is friendly and efficient. I'll be back for more

Went with friends to have a simple dinner. We ordered Pumpkin tomato sauce spaghetti ($8.90 excl. gst) and golden slated egg yolk fries ($8 excl. gst). Both taste good. Special vegetarian fast food. The restaurant is quite small and can be quite crowded at times. Other than fast food, they also offer local delights. This restaurant is located at Bugis cube (opposite Bugis junction)
