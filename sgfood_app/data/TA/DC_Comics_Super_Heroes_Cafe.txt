This is a restaurant you just go to especially if you have kids and love superheroes. Just plain an awesome setting and Oh yes the food was good too
5
One of the best restaurants in Singapore. Thanks to Leoren for a good service. I definitely come back.
5
Fast Service, Friendly Staff and the food is really nice. The place is very cool. I ordered Krypton Rocky Road and Baty french fries

As a fan of DC, I will not let this place escape my review. The place from the outside boasts a lot of DC superhero stuffs, such as lifesize figures, merchandise and the menu. By the looks at the price, you can say immediately that it’s pricey. Taste wise, it’s good but I guess the price is because of its design put on the food and the whole concept around it. Sure this place would be a lot better and attractive if the price of the food is a lot reasonable.

This cafe located inside marina bay shopping mall. We are attracted by the interior and decide to have lunch here and feels satisfied. Foods are normal fast food like fish and chips, fried chicken with rice but all tasty and less oil taste,good quality. The peach tea smoothy also delicious,yummy. Price are average but reasonable.Good place to have good meals.All spot are good for picture

We were excited to try this place but was left feeling a bit ripped off and disappointed. There is no table water, anything you want to drink you have to pay for, I’m assuming that is because they have a high rent to pay. I ordered a cocktail, which if you removed the ice probably had about a third of a cup of liquid in it, hence I left very thirsty. We waited for a lava cake and that did taste could, but due to it being overpriced and the disappointment in the drink I wouldn’t return.

EVERYTHING is superhero, from the plates to the napkins to the walls. There are two cafes next to each other. One is for take-out (hero-themed ice cream treats, and a few seats are available), and the other is for sitting down in booths. Don't go expecting great food, but the diner-type fare (burgers, hotdogs, fries, etc) was typical and pretty ok. Fun presentations for everything, which adds to the value. The gift store had some pretty cool stuff, even some pretty high-priced items for collectors
3
My daughter a lil bit scared of the statues at the side esp joker. Lol Maybe this resto more suitable for kids 3yo and up? We tried the waffle and oreo milkshake. The “batman” design was cute and food taste okay. But cashier was a lil bit cold when we asked them bout the menu. Other than that everything was okay. Im not sure if ill be back again tho.
4
A series of gift shops and cafes in the Marina Bay Sands Shoppes complex. Cafes are very superhero themed. One cafe is more casual and suits take-away, the other is for sit down dining.Great for superhero fans, young and old. Prices: standard for a cafe in Singapore in a high end location but value for money. Accessibility: Should be no issues, but it is a little tight for space.Amenities: Toilets located within the shopping mall. The gift store is great for collectors.
5
Cozy place with nice decoration and food. The service was fast and waiter and waitress are very friendly and patience too.
4
We popped in without reservation and had the best customer service experience.Meals are large but pricey. The Batman burger meal my son got was around S$38 but all up we spend Under S$70 including drinks. The staff gave my son lollipops and a little comic when leaving
4
The curly fries that came with the meal that I've ordered was too salty until I need to waste it. Otherwise, foods here was nice and price was reasonable as their foods served in big portions
4
The restaurant was very busy and noisy. Tables are very close to each other and you can hear what next table is chatting about. Service is good and foods looks good but taste normal.
3
Took my children to this place for brunch - huge menu. Service was okay. Food was not too good particularly for the price. Could have gotten a better breakfast at McDonalds for 1/5 of the cost of this place but that's what you do for your kids on holidays I guess.
3
We went because our daughter because she really wanted to.The place is aimed at kids and superhero fans.Kids will love it. Parents will hate it.Kids willow the decor, fast Food, superhero context. Parents will hate the food and pricing. Very expensive for what it is. But the kids will love it, the service was very good. The staff love their jobs and its a good way to kill some time.
1
Overpriced terrible food. I did not notice there was the food court downstairs. Don't waste your money on this place
3
Really cool cafe with lots of gimmicky things. The food was okay. I loved that everything was themed but be prepared for the price - one Batman box, one quesadilla and 2 x alcoholic drinks came to $137 and that was AFTER they gave a $20 discount on the Batman box! Yikes.
5
Perfect stop for a family with young kids or big kids that love comics. Syazwan our superhero waiter was perfect and spoilt us too. A must do if at marina bay ‘shoppes’.
3
Overpriced and not very delicious. However, it was an experience for kids and fans but we won’t make any 2nd visit
4
We visited as we were walking through the shopping complex & the kids wanted to go here for dinner. The food was better than I expected as generally these theme restaurants have average food I would recommend the Batman box. It is a little expensive but most of Singapore restaurants are but the experience is worth it especially if you have kids
5
Went there last week with my kids.. food was good.. the best thing about this place is their customer service... the staffs were really friendly and they were really good with the kids.. definitely would go back..
5
The place in Orchard Road Ngee Ann City Second Floor just opened this Sunday. Foods are all served in a dc comics themed, the comfort rooms are also themed, the tables, the chairs, the kitchen, and all are coordinated. All over the place including the menu, utensils, it is well-coordinated.. and all. If you are fond of the DC Comics You will love this place. Characters are all over the place. you will love this place. Crew are so helpful and accommodating! Thanks for the memorable visit
5
We ordered the wagyu burger set and a plate of bolognaise spaghetti with a side for our dinner. The wagyu beef burger is a huge huge thumbs up. Great job by both chef and waiter/waitresses.Not forgetting their super cool milkshake cups
5
Fun atmosphere with lots of cool DC comics models and statues. The detail is very good lots to look at. We were looking for a simple good lunch place and this fit the bill. The menu is quite extensive. Prices are reasonable for the Marina Bay Shoppes Mall. There will be something for everyone to choose from. One thing that was really unexpected was the drink variety. I got an amazing super vanilla milkshake with caramel and sea salt - yummy! Recommended for a good simple casual lunch
4
Had an awesome experience dining there tonight with my family. The servers checked on us regularly to ensure our order is correct and went on to brighten my children's night with 2 lollipops. Also, of course, the food is yum
5
We had a great dining experience. Food was nice with great service. Fantastic service given by Leoren
5
Superb customer service skills by Staff Leoren.. will surely recommend and comeback! Kudos to Leoren!
4
Funky fun place for a couple of coffees, 18.60 dollars a bit steep, but I had the Clarke Kent cappuccino for that, see phot
4
Was given a quiet cosy corner which is great as the main area was Super noisy and crowdedStaffs were friendly and constantly following up with us on our need
5
Being DC Comics fans, me and my wife visited this cafe on 04/11/2017 and must say it completely met our expectations in terms of food and the overall experience. The cafe should be a must visit place for all super hero fans where each and every thing is related to the comics right from food menu, wall paintings, the milk shakes with drapes, etc. We ordered vegetarian options like wonderwoman lasso fries and green lentern sector pizza which were very delicious. Special thanks to Syazwan fo helping us in choosing the right food and being very polite and courteous in explaining promotional offers, food ingredients and making our overall experience memorable
5
We passed by and decided to enter because we liked a lot the unique design of the cafe from outside. We have ordered 2 main dishes and 2 drinks, one of them was a milkshake “Ha-ha-ha” in “joker style”. It was so delicious...just try it. The food was very good as well. The total bill was around 80 dollars for 2. Also we would like say some words about our waiter (Syazwan). He was very complaisant and helpful in all
5
places there is wonderful but booth is limited should have moreservice there is wonderful and staff is the most courtiest and friendlies
4
A lttle over price for the food. Overall , taste and presentation of the food as well as the service staff are great
5
Unique theme design. Recommend for all DC comics super heroes fans! Food was great and portion was big
5
Delicious food! Nice and friendly staff! Plus the restaurant's theme and dishes decoration is the bes
5
My family and I really enjoyed our time here. All the staffs are Super Friendly, especially Syazwan who took the trouble to explain the menu and ingredients in detail.The food served are halal.We are already planning for the next dine in
5
My girlfriend and I felt we were the superheroes themselves ! And the dishes were so creatively named after the superheroes eg Batman’s gritty gotham brownie and wonder woman warrior rainbow chocolate cake n lime green arrow’s minty mojito which we had.Phylis the waitstaff was also very kind to take many photos of us posing with Superman, Wonderwoman and Batman. Super memories and super food
5
Nice ambience and good food for gathering. Brings back the stories of Super Heroes. A place for both young and old
5
Been to this super cool place with my friend. Had a great time! Not to forget, "Batty Batty Fries" we had was tasty!! Must visit if you are a DC fan and even if you aren't one
5
Offers a wide selection of choices which are superhero themed! Love the Wonder Woman Frick shake! Free superhero tumblers when you orders drinks
5
Food was great. Service was fantastic. Decor was so authentic. Irene and syazwan served us well. Thank you.
5
I've wanted to try the cafe for a long time and finally tried it today. Food was amazing, comic references included in the menu was entertaining. Service by Syazwan was top notch as well. Overall, great food and great ambiance, perfect for DC comic book fans!
4
It was an amazing experience at this cafe n Syazwan's service had been very good and attentive! Will come back again with my kids again
5
Service from Syazwan was excellent and general good quality is good. We have enjoyed ourselves with kids and family
4
good food quality and presentation would recommend to bring children. the staff are really nice and care for customer
1
Nice environment but average food, doesn't deserve this rate. First time I get disappointed with one good rated place in Trip
5
It’s our first time visiting this cafe. We’re very satisfied! The staff are friendly and helpful. The food is very good as well
3
The place looks nice, the staff is friendly. Prices are really high for what it offers. It's great if you are a DC fan as you get the chance to see some really nice life-size movies statues and replicas, signed memorabilia, souvenirs etc. We just had some dessert there, which was ok, but not really worth what we paid for it. However, if you are in the area it's an interesting place to stop by and take advantage of the AC
5
Nice place for having food. You all can came and enjoy the environment..hehe...we have order A lot....wvvvv....
5
I will definitely go back here!Good food and good service!!!The service crews are really kind especially miss Leoren who is really accommodating to us. Props to you and the management! Cheers!!!
5
First rime to try this cafe cause its my first timt to travel here in SG and its amazing, the place, food, servers are so nice specially Ms. Leoren shes so approachable and wonderful to talk to and recommended us to where place to go is.
5
It was a good and awesome experienced. Overall the service was stunning and it really made our day. Thank you for your excellent service guys Leoren and Phylis and for the lovely drinks and desserts made by Rica. Keep up the good work
4
I've been looking forward to visit this place ever since I booked my trip to Singapore. If you are a big fan of DC, this is the right place for you, not just for your tummy but for your eyes as well!! It contains all your favorite DC superheroes that would definitely make you feel at home. The staff is every accommodating and one even volunteered to take a picture of me since I'm alone. They keep checking on me if every thing is okay. For the food, I love how big the serving is. It was delicious as well. Didn't mind playing lots for a cafe like this. All the instagram shots were worth it. DC fans would definitely appreciate!!!
5
Often themed cafes have great deco but not so great tasting food. However, this cafe's food legit tastes great. Syazwan, Leoren and Irene were super friendly, welcoming and attentive! Great experience! Will definitely come back here. =
5
I was here with my little girl for lunch and what an experience it was! Syazwan waited on our table and was extremely cheerful and responsive, as were his other colleagues. The mushroom soup was awesome and my little said the meatball pasta was “super good” :) Kiddo also received hero themed lollipops at the end of the meal and also a full set of coasters with her fave heroes! We will be back again for sure!
5
Amazing design (interiors, menus, meals and drinks), very good food, super friendly staff (Phylis). Highly recommend :)
5
This by far has been the cutest super hero cafe we’ve been to! The food was delicious and had a great portion size in comparison to the price! Was well worth it and the service was great!! We were served pro dominantly by Phylis and she continually checked up on us to ensure we were satisfied and offered to take a photo of us!!! Amazing service and food ❤️
5
After a long walk round the bay, me and my friend decided to visit. Served by a gentleman called Syazwam who was great!!Syazwam told us all about all the special offers that were on. This made us decide to stay for food as well as a drink. Quick service and great food - made sure that we were happy with everything. Will definitely be visiting next time I’m in SG!
5
Very yummy, cool, well decorated place. Large portions of food and cool entertaining atmosphere! Kids will love this place
5
Good dish for dinner . Good service staff. If i have a chance i will come back again. I feel impress very muc

Nice restaurant if you like superhero, and Phylis is a very nice and friendly staff here.Good food and beverage.
5
A must visit location for a DC fans. The interior design is really comical. They serves western fast food with good taste. Staffs are very friendly, especially Ms. Phylis who was really helpful and served us with lots of smile
4
After a long walk I decided to check this place out before going to the art science museum. The food is good but the drinks are awesome, they even come with a little cap.And if you are a D.C. Fan you should definitely check out this place
5
I had a burger and it was cooked to perfection. Good food and great service.If your a comic book fan then it’s worth a visit.
1
This is one of the worst meals I’ve had in a while. The servers don’t care. The cooks don’t care. It is overpriced and the food is inedible. I had a quesadilla. Three pieces. Two contained no cheese and it was burnt. The only water available is high end bottled water. Don’t waste your time or money.
5
Well this place is really incredible. Food is standard American fare, however the decor is out of this world. Would definitely recommend this place is you are DC fan.. I have never seen anything like it before.
5
Lovely place to celebrate yr hubby's birthday! Thanks to staff- Kelly, Irene, Suhami who sang a lovely birthday song to my hubby!
5
We walked in with apprehension and stepped out with delight and smiles on all our faces. We had our 6 year old with us and his excitement all through our time at the cafe couldn’t be described.Phylis took very good care of us and kept our son amused by delivering his demands without fuss.Lots of food and drinks to choose from on the menu so people with all tastes can easily be appeased.We would be back again for sure.ThanksArc
5
Dc comic super heroes Cafe is one of my wife and me a must go dinning Cafe in our singapore trip. Place is nice, food are awesome and tasty, but don't miss their drink as well.

5
Great restaurant for fans of DC comics, with Boothe's dedicated to particular super heroes, such as Wonder Woman, Batman etc. The food is also themed with the batman bat wingsappearing on burger buns. Drinks are also served in themed containers which you can keep for an additional cost. The food was good and reasonably priced and the waiting staff were very attentive
5
I don't need to say much. It's just awesome. Food was good. Portion was huge.All had unique logos on them. Got the seafood carbonara. Which was very unique. Service was tip top from Syazwan. Very attentive and very fast. Faster than flash.Thumbs up!

 Good Service Delicious food and very cool how their many designs everywhere! Insta worthy photos a have to go place if you love selfies, especially with superheroes! Nearby is a DC superhero clothes shop and it has different themed places for superhero lovers! If you get the set with the lunchbox be careful! The serving size is huge bring a friend along to help you eat and overall a 9/10 must go if you love superheroes
5
Very "FLASH" services, as elegant as "WONDER WOMAN", humble like "SUPERMAN", as cool as "BATMAN", and as fresh as "GREEN LANTERN"...Thanks to Syazwan for the services, nice personality. Like him the most

4
I brought my son here for his birthday at his request. I was pleasantly surprised at the quality and tastiness of the food; certainly not expected at a themed cafe!The service crew was friendly and attentive ; I would like to call out Syazwan in particular for making my boy's day with his thoughtful gesture and gifts. Upon knowing it was my son's birthday, he dressed him up in a Batman apron. He didn't forget his sisters either and gifted them with a pop light each and candies! What a wonderful way to celebrate a birthday
5
DC cafe have more food,drink and dessert. It is awesome and best service.If I back to visit SG again i will be back.
5
Very good service. I will recommend it to my friends and family. I will come back. The service us excellent. Our waiter Phylis was very friendly and very good service
5
Syazwan had provide a good service and he made an effort to prepare things for my friend and me. The environment here is so fun and more to the theme.
5
Best place to celebrate my birthday! I love the batman steak from the justice league menu but the fish & chip (from the normal menu)was okay only maybe not use to eating white fish. The Wonder Woman lava cake was the bomb, really rich. I also loved that they gave us the booth seats somehow I'm always seated at flash's booth but I would love to seat at the other booth. Maybe next time can put it as a request. Other than that it was a great visit
5
Great service, fun and tasty food :) definitely worth a visit. Had the batman burger, flash ginger ale to drink and joker rainbow cheesecake for dessert
5
Great place for dessert! Hot beverage and cakes are their must try. Staff are very accomodating and friendly. Even takes photos like a pro!
4
We stopped by for a drink, and the atmosphere here is lovely. The drinks were completely done in a super hero design, pretty cool. It was a bit above our budget though, so not able to order any food unfortunately
5
Food was very worth the price! Very good serving size and great taste. The cakes are delicious. Loved the catwoman (caramel) latte which was not as sweet like how other cafes do (which very well suit my taste). Great food presentation & definitely worth thr visit
5
This is where I would have spent all my birthdays as a kid if the place existed then. Syazwa the guy who served us was great. Took real good care of the table. The food was great. Definitely not my last time here. Recommended to any comic fan. Loved the wings :D
5
I ordered the flash hotdog and the flash (strawbarry milkshake). Hotdog is perfect, a little bit spicy. If you're the flash fan, u should try this one. The strawbarry milkshake is also delicious. Syazwan provided a good service, enhancing my experience in this cafe. It's a wonderful memory to eat here
5
We really enjoy our time at the DC Super Heroes Cafe. The foods are great and the services are really good. Looking forward to our next visit
5
My and I had a wonderful dinner here we ordered Dark Knight Burger, Superman Burger & Truffle Pasta and they were all scrumptious!!! The staff were all nice, Rica and Phylis were very attentive. Definitely I highly recommend this

Great food and ambience. I will definitely recommend this place to my friends and bring them over here in the future. I love the fact all the plates, walls, and settings are all decorated and adorned with dc characters. Its a very unique idea
5
The food tastes delicious and the ambience is very cool, very suitable for dc marvel fans. I will definitely come back in the future when i have the opportunity. The settings is very chill as well, the cups, plates, walls and everything look amazing with the decorations.

Little bit on pricey side, and limited dietary options (no soy milk) but great experience especially for DC fans. Fun and great for photo ops. Service was great, thanks for a great meal
5
If you like comics and superheroes this is the place to be! The food is delicious and all superhero themed!
3
Two share plates and 4 drinks to the amount of $80 is too expensive for simple meals. The drinks were good and the service pleasant and polite. The cafe was obviously from DC themes and the props were good. Not recommended due to price tag but if you are a big Batman or super hero fan then perhaps its worth i
1
Don't waste your time here. Arrived at 9.45pm only to be told that kitchen is closed at 10pm. We pointed out that it wasn't that time so reluctantly agreed to seat us. Despite listing 'Gluten free' options, they don't have any and seemed pleased for us to leave
5
We was walking by on our way to Gardens by the bay and saw this resturant. Being DC fans we had to swing by and we were amazed. Food was awesome and hot along with the service. Please ask for server Phylis
5
The service crew is attentive and fast. They were able to remember the orders even if we were a large group
5
Love both the Superman Pizza and the Waffles and Chicken platter :) Servings are huge - definitely for sharing :) Double Chocolate Batman milkshake is definitely not to miss! Customer Service at its finest :) Our server, Rica, made food recommendations when we were ordering and has taken care of everything we need during our eat in :) We’ll definitely go back and even recommend to friends :

This was the kids choice for dinner one night whilst staying at MBS hotel and of course they enjoyed the novelty of it. I ordered the dark knight burger and the serving was huge. The meal was average as expected but it was all in good fun. The presentation was great! The prices were too high though for the standard of food. At the end of the day if you have D.C. Comic fans then you will enjoy
5
serve with friendly, meal with large! i can't even finish it! Nice Try! :) a great place for gathering! specially thanks to waitress Ms Rica :b u r so friendly! xD

One of the best superhero theme cafes I've ever seen! Tons of choice and well made drinks! Awesome cups
5
The food such as cake, drinks coffee and service was perfect especially phylis she was very very very nice and helpfu
5
This place was great! When you hear about a restaurant like this you would think the food would be terrible. Totally opposite. Food and drinks were both on point. I wanted to get more types of food but there just wasn't enough time. Dessert drinks are where it's at.
5
Walking past we decided to pop in for a snack and drink.Best decision we have made all day.The food was delicious the drinks cold and the service faultless We were served by the lovely Phylis, she was bubbly and very helpful
5
IF YOU LOVE AMERICAN COMFORT FOOD AND IF YOU LOVE DC SUPERHEROS THEN THIS PLACE IS A TRUE GEM I SINGAPORE. I have never been more happy than when i was at this place the real superhero geek kid comes out in all of us. The food is really tasty the staff is real nice and understanding and they also have veg options also. One of the most coolest places on earth
5
My daughter like a lot for decoration.Carbonara spaghetti is delicious.Price is average to above.I love it

The DC themed restaurant has thought of everything from the themed plates, knives and forks, sauce dishes and cups to the shapes of the food and the overall ambience. Sometimes it can be hard to find the staff as the premises is split
4
Really nice restaurant, good food and nice atmosphere, food is a bit pricey but taste quite well, good drink selection as well.
4
We love the superhero ambiences and phylis service here and to celebrate bday for my younger boy where he can experience food with superhero decoration and art as well as drinks are in cute superhero tumbler.
5
I had nerdgasms coming into the resto. The ambiance make you feel like a child in a toy shop just wanting everything on display. Heroes from superman all the way to hawk and dove can be found here. I highly recommend this place for DC enthusiasts.
5
My boyfriend is is a huge fan of DC. And when we came here i just saw his face light up. The ambiance is welcoming and according to hin it makes you feel like a super hero. It also brings out the kid in you. The food is great. I recommend the green latern apple shake
3
Based on my preference of DC I really like the theme, cafe's design and service. I didn't order the food so i dont have any comments. About the dessert and drinks i ordered chocolate lava cake , harley quinn mint milkshake and hot cappuchino. About the drinks i think it's ok and about the dessert i think it's too sweet for me but still the DC fan come here wont regret
3
I just had to check out this place, and glad I did! There’s plenty on display and beware parents, you may end up leaving with an empty wallet!The food was a bit pricey for me (no surprise as it’s in Marina Bay Mall) so I just had a milkshake.
5
We love everything! The ambience, service and food! Great experience as my children love it too! From food to desserts, love love love it! Staff(Phyllis) was friendly and warm. Love the decorations too. Will definitely come back again to try out other dishes
5
The food is great! The service is awesome! 1 staff named Syazwan is really nice and made the experience more lively
5
I found it by accident the day we were leaving singapore and we were in a rush. Great merchandise, totally great for a geek like myself. The staff at the restaurant was super friendly and efficient. Food was Fine, thats not the most important thing here. I will come back ❤
5
My husband is a geek, so it was a perfect spot to have the last meal at Singapore The food was great and all the staff was very kind and nice We will be here again when we come back to Singapore
4
Staff very friendly and welcoming. Food was served quickly and hot would definitely visit again atmosphere nice and some lovely added extras to the theme
5
Food was great, not to mention the presentation. Love it! Staffs were awesome. We had a fun family time here. Thank you!
5
Really cool place. I enjoyed my cafe latte with the Batman coffee art. Thank you for the great time
5
We went for our evening meal. Staff were very helpful and the food was great. Loved the theme too! Highly recommen
5
Looking for somewhere to eat while awaiting the light show I was surprised to discover this themed cafe. Phylis was a great waitress - bringing me extra sauce for my Wonder Woman pancakes just because she thought that I should have more. Highly recommend this experience
3
This place is OK. Food is a bit plastic fantastic, prices are high for the quality, but the theme is good fun and the service was good. We won't rush back, but the kids quite enjoyed it. It would be better if the staff were properly dressed up and they interacted with the kids more. It would become a bit more alive and magical. The adjoining shop is genius from a marketing point of view. My purse certainly wasn't feeling superhero after going in there with 3 kids... If you're visiting Singapore and have it on your list of things to do; move it near the bottom.
5
I will come here again. Waitresses are kindness. Dessert is very cute. If you leave in singapore, I hope you visit here
1
Very cheap quality food for fine dining price. If you are thinking of going there, don't bother. The worst food so far on our holiday, and then having to pay the most we have had to pay on a meal. The service wasn't bad, however, would never go there again
1
Except the decoration and themed menus, the food is very simple and ordinary, and servings are rather average in size. The worst is that the prices of all items are very high. Very few people eating while we were there, no wonder
1
Very average, overpriced and very ordinary food. Could be a really good place if a bit more thought went into it
4
The ambience and the burger is certainly out of this world such a great place and ambiance..definitely will not be the last time
5
Located above the ice rink in the shopping centre & next to the Street Food kitchens. Safe environment & easy to let kids relax for a while ....
5
Amazing Cafe!!
The food was fantastic and the hole ambience is Awesome!!
We wish that we had something like this at home
5
Its a Restaurant and a small shop, all things Comic. Few Mannequins around dressed as wonder women, joker, batman, Aquaman Superman etc. Worth a stop to have a look at the menu. Tables have comics imprinted on them. We only brought an icecream which was nice. There was a small shop you could buy tshirts and figurines etc. There was a Full Batman car int he store, worth a look
3
I have been eating there for company event. It's a nice environment but nothing special about the food. It's a bit expensive for what it is but if you don't have any idea to go you can have a try there.
2
Mediocre burger. Common guys at this price tag you can do better. Patty was clearly not grilled on the spot. The place is great if you have kids but a little overpriced for the kind of food it serves. The cost of t shirts is ridiculus unless the wonder woman sugn is made of her blood.
4
Food was tastier than expected and the superhero branding is well done. lunch offers are a good value vs others (nothing is cheap)
5
We had a Wonder Woman themed set dinner here in July 2017. It was a prize from a contest so honestly we didn't fork out any money for the food. Honestly, I did not expect much from DC Comics Super Heroes Cafe, as most theme restaurants have so-so food and people visit them for the fun and novelty. Once the food were served, however, I was totally blown away, as the quality of ALL the various dishes was really good. The ingredients were fresh, and the dishes are served with awesome details with accompanying touches to fit into the theme, and wow! The food tasted good indeed, and the portions were huge too. The ambience of the cafe was really fun and lively, and we got to take many nice photographs for keepsake. I also have to mention the friendliness and great service of the staff, they were all so kind and attentive. Thumbs up DC Cafe and keep it up
5
We had dinner at the Super Hero cafe and it was great. The atmosphere and memorabilia were worth the visit alone. We all ordered the BBQ chicken Quesadilla which was a nice and mild dish. Staff were also very friendly and helpfu
5
Wicked concept. Everything was very cool. The batman wagyu burger was amazing was cooked to perfection bursting with amazing flavour.
5
Awesome! My super hero fan of a hubby loved it especially! Great coffee. Lovely staff. Will be back!
5
Good food, nice ambiance, great service! Serving is as seen in the menu. The menu is beautifully crafted as well.
3
We went with two tweens who are big super-hero fans. We had a great time joking around about the decor and menu and the overall atmosphere, which was fun, The menu looked great however the food itself and service did not match. We had so many issues from ordering to settling the bill. There were a lot of staff but none helpful and in the middle of failing to attend to our requests they kept asking us to give the a good review for a free key-chain. Pretty pricey for the gimic and lack of service. A fun experience was dampened
5
This restaurant has been on my to eat at list since I saw it advertised on the web 2 years ago. All I can say if your a D.C. Comics fan then you won't be disappointed. Wen here with a friend to dine and from the outset, was not disappointed the greeting when we enquirer was super friendly and worthy of a pennyworth medal for politeness. The restraint was not to busy when we visited so our meal arrive in a flash. The menu is good especially the bat burger, holy burgers robin, it was huge, and served in the batsman logo box was awesome. From start to finish the experience was great, the severs were fantastic, the food tasty and lots of it, and the beer was cold, what more could I ask for in a themed restaurant. If you have the time and you are in the marina Bay Area and looking for fun food in the company of some D.C. Heros, head here, a great, fun dining experience
5
Fab, even better than Hard Rock!Lots of photo opportunities special thanks to our waiter Syazwan, what a hero
5
Personally, I am not a massive fan of superheroes, comics etc but someone close to me is. This cafe blew me away! Its amazing decor, superhero/ super-attentive staff and mind- blowing cocktails! 100 percent worth a visit the service and quality is second to none!
4
medium quality food and drinks but location and package is really the best. winderwoman batman jocker everything is SUPER. expensive but if you are xhildren you need to have a visit. be carrefull with dark cono icecream a surprise will wait for yoy after in the bathroo
5
This place was wonderful. My kids loved the superheroes everywhere. We sat at table Aquaman and ate all sorts of awesome DC flavoured food and drinks.My youngest son had a batman shirt on by coincidence and the waitress thought it was awesome so she gave him a free bat cape. When my other 2 kids looked sad she brought them DC boiled lollies.THis place left a lasting impression on my family and I can't wait to visit again
4
Every dc fans should try this place, cute & fun food appearance and various type of snack, worth to try chicken wing & drum stick, visit this place because im staying in marina bay sands and passing by the stor
5
Beautiful restaurant! Kids friendly and staff are attentive. We are served by Leoren and shes very helpful.
5
I love the ambience of this cafe. From plates to tables to everything it's designed in dc comics. The Staff Leoren was very accomodating and very friendly. The food we ate Joker's Crazy Cheesy Nacho was the bomb! It's an experience eating this cafe. :
5
Extraterrestrial concept themed cafe- Unique structure & great ambianceSuperhuman waiters & crew- Attentive, accommodating, kind & friendlyHeroin food & drinks- Addictive because it is served deliciously & unique presentationAfter this dining experience, I feel like I'm one superhero added in Justice League 
4
Saw the sign and thought my son would like it. He loved it! A very clever concept cafe themed to the max. A very large menu to choose from. While some of the items did not appeal tome what we had was most enjoyable and the waitress Kelly was a delight. If you are into DC it's a must see
5
I was just walking out of the Gardens by the Bay, and accidentally ran into the mall. I decided to grab dinner and saw this place as I walked in. Im not usually into American style food. Especially since I was in an Asian country. However the waiter was genuinely nice and a few times in the menu did catching eye. I got the shrimp prawns with chili and cheese dipping sauce. Who knew cheese and Shrimp would go together. I also got the cheese rice and some wings. I ordered too much and didn't finish. Haha the drinks are pretty good too. I had ordered two different kinds. This seemed like a great place to take the kids, since I saw a few families. You couldn't help but smile. I would recommend to try it at least once just for hr experience.
5
Nice place good idea. Food very nice I had the batman burger which was great. Imagine it can get very busy. Would come agai
5
Amazing place with very nice staff. No need to drink a special drink in order to drink in a special glass. If you drink a simple coke they are going to let you drink it in a beautiful glass. Very good decoration. Beautiful tables, chairs, statues, and very lovely staff ! Good moment in Singapore !
5
I went to this restaurant together with my girls aged 6 and 8. Though they are not a great fan of super hero. They like the restaurant. It has an unique theme, the staff was friendly and even provided them with story books to read. Food wise it was great as well but it can be pricely. Overall will recommend this place.
5
Excellent place with family. Food were great! Will sure come back again! Staffs were great! Superb service! Must try their carbonara pasta. You will enjoy it. Brought both my kids alone and they enjoy it so much!
5
Came here for the gimmick but the food was incredibly tasty and filling with very cute presentation. Staff were very friendly and helpful! 10/10 would recommend especially if you are a DC fan yourself!
5
Fabulous lunch, both food and service. Phylis was brilliant. 8year old son was in heaven Really well done theme restaurant.
5
Food was incredibly tasty and filling with very cute presentation. Staff were very friendly and helpful! 10/10 would recommend.
5
It's a nice place to go to if you simply want to hang and have a snack.
But it will be a better experience for those who are big fans of DC comics.
5
The batman burger is delicious. There is large selection of food to choose from and it was a very enjoyable experience and I would recommend.
4
The food is good. Restaurant ambience and set-up is cool. Brings me back to my younger years.. Customer service is also very good!
4
Food was really filling, food presentation was good as well. The staff were really nice and responsive. Although the price is a little too high for the quality of food, overall, its still a 4/5. :)
5
This restaurant is excellent! No words will suffice. You have to visit and experience it yourself. You won't be disappointed. Kudos to Phyllis
5
Brought my cousins to try the food and we were not disappointed. Food serving was big and hearty. Presentation was well thought of and in keeping with the theme. Taste was excellent. Service was very good especially from PHYLLIS. Well worth the visit and highly recommended. Will definitely come back
3
We stopped in here for dinner because of the theme. We ordered standard burgers from the menu, nothing complicated. The burgers were burgers. The service was extremely slow although there were lots of staff standing around talking to each other and the burgers were expensive for burgers
5
Nice theme and decent food to go to when you're hungry. My friends and I could spend more than 2 hours on the menu alone
5
Great place to visit.fKids like the food and much to offer for the adults. Fun to see DC haracters around..really pleasant time
4
We weren't aware that there's already a DC cafe in Singapore. And being the nerd and geek that I am, I needed to eat here. So I dragged my friend along and we were not disappointed. The food was good, and the service crews were very attentive. Definitely will recommend to everyone and let them indulge their inner kid in you
5
We visited mainly because of the novelty but it ended up being a delicious meal and excellent drinks. We had the mushroom pasta and the Dark Knight burger and both were great. The Shazam tropical drink and the Shirley He's Fast drink were both also amazing. It was so good we went back twice more during our visit in Singapore, and brought our friends on the last visit - they also loved it. Our server Rica recognised us on both our return visits and made sure our experiences were excellent. Highly recommended for both comics fans and everyone else.
5
Visit DC cafe to celebrate birthday. Nice food and excellent service by Phylis.The Batman burger come with cool box and the portion is huge!
5
Super Heroes Cafe was awesome! ambiance was perfect for kids and adults (especially kids at heart). Food is the best!Staffs were friendly and nice especially PhylisOverall great experience. Recommended to everybody of any age to visit this place
5
Nice place not only for DC fans, but also for anyone who cherishes good food. Our waitress Phylis was super nice and friendly. The size of dishes is large, so we ordered one meal to share, and Phylis kindly offered to cut the burger. The dessert here is goals, best lava cake ever. Highly recommend.
5
Excellent food and ambience. Lovely place to bring the family. Thank you to the staff especially Rica.
5
I love this place. They paid close attention to details from the very origins of many loved superheroes until the very recent movies. The menu is inspired my many heroes like Batman, Superman, Wonder woman, the flash, green lanterb and aqua man. The taste super good too. Definitely a must when coming to Singapore!!
5
Fish&Ship serving in a big dish. Food is delicious. Nice place to spend time with kid. Good service from staff. Order got fast. You can have a lunch with your favorite character from DC comic. Next time to Singapore will visit again
5
Loved the interiors, foods and drinks plus Friendly staff. Worth visit! Great location as we were here before getting to Gardens by the bay
5
The food in this place is delicious. Besides the great atmosphere, the service was also amazing! Phylis was very attentive and helpful. Definitely recommended
5
Since the moment you walk in the experience is top notch. Phylis was our server and she was super sweet in explaining the menu. The food is delicious. We had the Batman Burger that came in a box in a shape of the logo. Every superhero has a special item attached in every meal. Shakes were also great. I will certainly come back again when I am in town.
5
Burger was good and the serving was big. The sauce that came with the burger was excellent. Staff are friendly and the ambiance is good. Definitely coming back.
5
The service is amazing, the staffs are very friendly～ A lovely place for DC fans, i love the topic about wonder woman, when you walked in, you will find many pictures and thinga about her. Also the restaurant provide the theme package for wonder woman at this month, if you are the fans of her, you should come~ you will love the environment and food
3
I can’t really recommend the Superhero Cafe.... the food is very bland, the service is lacklustre and price is very high for what you’re getting. Think McDonalds with some comic book theming and a 100% price premium above what it should be.
5
Great food. EXCELLENT service. Such attention to detail. Lovely wait staff. HIGHLY RECOMMEND as a fun family stop off.
3
Average food at excessive pricing! Definitely a one off visit and I would not recommend at all.....
5
The food was great and so as your staff named Leoren!Best service ever!I will recommend your place to friends and people that i would meet!Definitely the place was superb!Medy Banto
5
The food is good, I wasn't really expect the food is good especially dining at character cafe. But this time is different, the chicken is so tasty and juicy. Their follow up service is excellent. Overall I highly recommend.
5
We had great fun with the menu, which were emblazoned with the superheroes' crest. The food was yummy to both the eyes and the palate. And they appeal to kids and kids at heart
5
great food for family dining ..salad was nice my kid enjoyed it.recommended for all the children.have fun in singapore .
5
This is my second time to be here with my friend. I like the design so much. The food, drink and also the service are very good. Will be back again
5
Our first time to try DC Super Heroes Cafe at MBS and it was a great experience. The food was superb and my kids loved the menu book, plates, glass etc designed with our all time favorite heroes. Wonderful and friendly staff too!
5
Lovely place to have good food and drinks! Super fun atmosphere great service! We had quesadilla and nachos. Was fine but not amazing. Then we finished with the Oreo cheesecake which was killer
5
Awesome decoration and good food at a reasonable price.The menu is filled with fun facts and the dishes are quite creatively themed.Hard to decide what to eat, I feel like I have to come back soo
5
We just arrived to Singapore and visited the DC comics super heroes cafe! Amazing experience, great food , great service and wonderful decoration. Dont miss it, give it a go and feel like a super hero!!
5
My husband loves comics so this was the perfect lunch spot whilst sightseeing! Great service & food, our waitress Phyliss was especially helpful & friendly.
5
We visited DC Comics Superheroes Cafe after getting off a flight to Singapore. It was very close to our hotel. The decor of the restaurant is amazing - a real novelty. Great for a few photos! The food was delicious - American style diner choice menu. The service was great. Definitely worth a visit, especially if you have kids or are a big kid at heart. The desserts are absolutely tantalising! Try the krytonian rocky road waffle
5
So good, reasonable prices, lovey atmosphere and service, nice staff and great food, would definitely recommend coming if you're in the area
5
The cafe was decked out in all superhero decor which made for a novel dinner. The staff are really great. We had Phyllis and Rica serve us. They kept making sure our dinner experience was perfect. The food was very themed and delicious! A must try if you are in the area
5
What a fantastic idea! My partner and I stumbled across this little gem whilst navigating the vast Marina Bay Sands shopping mall. The service was excellent, the food cooked well and brought out quickly! For those put off by the charcoal bun - it tastes the same as a normal one. My only point against them was the fact that they were listed as opening at 1030 but the kitchen itself was not open until 1100, however you can still purchase sweets, ice cream, and other food that is does not required preparation by the kitchen staff so I will not remove a star for that. There is also an attached gift shop with all sorts of knick knacks!
5
Food is awesome , affordable! Will definitely come back again and recommend my Friend to this cafe to have their meals. They do sell accessories and clothing too
5
Great service. Very fast. Very helpful. Asking for ways to improve. Food was delicious, loved the curly fries and quesadilla. Would come back again for sure! Must try a dessert next time!
5
What an awesome cafe for any DC comic fan! Lovely food and very friendly staff. We were served by Phyllis and Rica who could not do enough for us. I recommend The Batman Burger and the Bat Truffle pasta, both were delicious. Great for adults as well as children!!
5
Service was quicker than expected, food is great as they really try to improve the idea of fast food by having a large menu selection. They also have a very large variety of drinks and cocktails and kids menus. The experience is great but be aware that it is a bit overpriced
5
Geeks, BEWARE! U will enter a world of MAXIMUM delciousness paired with AWESOME decirations of your favorite DC characters!! I LOVED IT!
5
Good food, good venue, nice theme for a restaurant, match with the shirt we are wearing, thanks for the remembrance and everything.⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⚡️⚡️⚡️⚡️⚡️⚡️⚡️⚡️⚡️⚡️⚡️⚡️⚡

The staffs in this cafe are all good and friendly. They are very patient in terms of serving their costumers. I would love to go back here and bring other set of friends with me Great Job! ❤
5
Excellent place to celebrate a birthday with unique dish names, extremely filling with big portion. Their desserts are amazing!!!!!!! Must try atleast once!!!
5
Big portions, great burgers, delicious desert, friendly staff and even better setting. If you can finish the batman burger and the nutella freak shake, you're a true super hero! Must do when you're in the shoppes at marina bay sands
5
Just had lunch here today. The location and the service is excellent. The staff Phyllis looked after us very well. The kids love everything here. Lovely food and brilliant crew. Thank you DC cafe Singapore
5
Came here for dinner with hubby and my son, the food was excellent! Love the decorations in the restaurant, even the menu was extremely attractive and fun! A must visit when u go to Singapore
5
Food quality and customer service are very good. Background theme of main shop has shown a wide range of superheroes dominantly
5
Food pretty decent and service great. Always wary of these restaurants but this was decent. Our waitress Leoren was super!
5
One of the best meals in singapore!!!! Thank you to rica for your food recommendations and for your hospitality! Food was great and service is the best! Two thumbs up!!!!!
5
We had an amazing meal with very nice service! Would highly recommend going here.
Great place for families and even couples on a date!
5
We are doing our school project at dc comics superheroes, and the food is nice, the fries is very crispy, all in all, nice place to enjoy dinner!
5
Tasty food and big portion sizes. Well worth the money for the chill atmosphere! Sweet that each booth had a different super hero theme
5
I enjoyed the environment and concept of the cafe. The unique menu design provided us with great conversation and entertainment to pass the time!The staff are positive as accommodating to our needs and we truly had an enjoyable meal
5
Friendly Staff! Good food though price can be a little pricey.Theme of restaraunt captures the heart of the diner and we are able to immerse ourselves in the superheroes experienc
5
Great location in a justice league episode.The service was very kind, especially Leoren. The hamburgers and the appetisers were amazing. Perfect for family and friends!!
5
I really liked the food and the service is really nice as well. The place is really nice for families and children would love it there.
5
Nice theme café with an extensive menu. Had some fika - I took the lemon meringue Cake and My boyfriend had the Oreo cake. If you go between 3-6 pm you get a Cake and coffee/Tea for S$10, which is Good value in Singapore. I also had the Grapes of Wrath yoghurt drink which was delicious. Great stop after a day in the Gardens by the Bay
5
This is our first time visiting DC Comics Singapore. Prices are a little steep but overall good food & service!! Staff are extremely attentive! We were here to celebrate our son's birthday & were greeted by Phylis when we first arrived. As soon as we sat down, Phylis came over with a birthday gift as well as offering wordings & decorations for a cupcake that we ordered. Phylis could guess it was his birthday seeing him dresses up! That's how attentive the staff are! Kids were also kept occupied by storybooks while waiting for the food to be served. Keep up the good service, DC Comics Singapore!
4
Celebrated my birthday here with friends. The food is great, we ordered squid ink batman pasta that tastes great. Phyllis (the staff that served us) is very friendly and helpful, she is super awesome. We ordered cake and when she knew it was my birthday she walked to get a candle for me and gave me an awesome birthday gift. Overall we'll visit here again definitely!!
4
We have been served with kind staff, Phyllis. The food was good... The cafe was creative... Definitely will come back... :
5
We came for the birthday of our little son and we loved the place. Good food and nice ambience. Ask waitress Leoren to serve you. She is great
5
Got a free apron because it was my birthday last month, woohoo syphilis was friendly and she keeps coming back to check on our food
5
My sister and I ate dinner here and loved it. Food was delicious. Especially the Wonder Woman lasso fries. It has such a fun atmosphere, servers were very friendly and we had a great experience
4
Unique and lovely experience with great company. Wide variety of food choices that are well-decorated. Phyllis was also very friendly and served us well. Will certainly come back again if given the chance!
4
Decent food, dedicated service. Celebrated friends' birthdays here and they gave them free superhero aprons!
5
Was here for dinner.. Good food and great service! Thanks Phyllis for the awesome service, we had a great time!
5
Absolutely loved the concept of this place and the food. The service was fantastic as well. Special mention to Phyllis for being so friendly :
3
If you are a Batman or Superman fan, you must go here!!! No questions...It's also awesome for children. The bring the food in superheroes boxes and there are Batman or Superman logos on every meal!!!The service is really good!!!But the food is bad... I mean it's ok... nothing special!!!But again who cares when can eat a Dark Knight Burger!!!
2
So, first time here and don't think we will be back. Food presentation was perfect, but quality was meh. The "wagyu" burger was such a disappointment - So heavily seasoned with oregano it tasted more like meatloaf, and a great waste of wagyu if it indeed was. The baked rice was so underseasoned and lacked flavour that no amount of salt or Tabasco helped me enjoy it. Did not stay for desserts. Sadly the only saving grace was the coffee and the fries that came with the burger
4
Very nice and helpful staff the food was delicious! Will recomend to eat here! Tried the mushroom soup and the local fried chicken with rice that was scrumptious!
2
We were really looking forward for this restaurant, it really looks great and the staff are very friendly. However, we ordered desserts (red velvet and cupcakes) that did not taste good at all- even though we are not picky. The ice-creams were okay. Would not really recommend the desserts, haven't tried the food.
5
I stopped by the cafe after hearing recommendations from a few friends, and since I was nearby for a show at the Bay, stopped in for dinner. The lovely staff found a table for me straight away, and were very attentive and happy to chat. My host Syazwan was lovely, and provided wonderful customer service. Food was amazing, and I look forward to coming back next time I'm in Singapore :-
5
Good food, nice environment! Ordered super heroes bento, both burgers are really nice. Very big portion. Recommend Batman set with wagyu beef burger.
4
Great theme and decorations. Meal prices are fair and the choice of food selection is decent. Great variety of dessert and drinks with good service. Most impressed by displays and gift shop
5
Good service and food are nice. Maybe can have iced water serving will be good! Quite a nice place to chitchat at :
4
The food is great...you feel like a super hero.. the staff is so courteous @ Rica. Will come back..
4
You guys must try this one at DC Comic Superhero very affordable and delicious at the same time it has a good presentation so that dont missed it..And the staff like Rica is so approachable ;
4
Food taste very good. Presentation is amazing. Staff is accomodating (to mention Ms.Rica)Overall worth for the money
5
Delicious foods. Looking forward to eat on this restaurant again & again.. super loved the food. Best food ever..nice place also.
5
Capping the night with great food and great ambiance at DC Super Heroes Cafe after a long walk we are all delighted to experience dining with our favorite super heroes!
5
The food is super great.. You don't need to be a super hero to taste their food.. Super yummy.. Even their staff is well accomadating & friendly @ staff RICA.. :) â™
5
The food is good, the staff is very accomodating, most especially the staff assisted us Hooray! to Ms. Rica, she patiently waited us to take our orders
5
The food and service was great ! Me and my boyfriend enjoyed the experience. I definitely recommend this place when you visit Singapore
5
If you or your kids loves superheroes, this is the place to go. The menu is cool, the restaurant is cool, the staff is serviceminded, the walls got superheroes and even the carrot will look like batman. The food is not a wow moment but the environment is! Loved it
5
Great food and awesome service. Staff is very friendly and informative. Food is way over expectation.We would love to come back
5
My wife and I came here on a rare date. We loved the ambience! The food was awesome and the way they presented the food was really top knotch (see photos)!We would go there again when given an opportunity
4
We visited the superheroes cafe and had there a good time. Waffles and iced teas were both tasty, but also expensive. If you are looking for cheap eats, you are definitely wrong here but the location was the spending worth for us
5

Stopped off here for some lunch and had a nice time reminiscing about lots of fun DC hero moments. A solid range of Western meal options are found in a very creative and comic focused menu. Top to bottom focus on theming the restaurant with a nicely done shop as well. Service was quick and attentive and the food was fairly good for this type of place. Glad we stopped by

We took my 9 year old son (and his two younger sisters) here for a birthday dinner. They all loved it from the cartoons, to the superhero themed food, to the comics in the menus. Environment is great, food was very good, and special thanks to the staff who were very attentive and friendly, and even came around and sang Happy Birthday before we left.
5
Go hungry !!!! Servings are massive & service is superb. Highly recommend A+ the waiters was helpful the menu is very colourful & cute to read. The batman box was very comical.

5
I was in Singapore on a research grant and treated myself to a visit to the Marina Bay Sands. I had not eaten lunch yet, so I stopped in the DC Super Heroes Cafe. The squid ink truffle pasta was a great portion and delicious. The decor is DC themed, which was perfect for gazing while dining solo. The staff is attentive and very helpful, explaining all the options and promotions available. I chose Ã  la carte, but the set menus were a great deal for non food court dining. I was especially pleased with my server, Phylis! Overall it was a great option for lunch and I can see it being a don't miss for any DC fans or little ones if you are in Singapore and craving more Western fare. There is also a great shoppe and snack bar if you don't want a full meal as well. I willdefinitely be back!
5
It's a good experience to have, the food comes with the heroes logos and tastes great, definitely recommende
5
Was thrilled to see the cafe, I loved the decoration and the food.I love comics..i highly recommend to eat in this resturant
5
Came here with some friends from Japan around 3.30 to 5pm. We had their tea time promo which we highly recommend. Leoren and Phyllis were very friendly and attentive and the cakes and coffee were really worth the price. 10/10 would come again :
5
Great place to spend your time with your family. My kids love the ice cream and the nachos with cheese.
5
Awesome food and kids are fully excited and happy. Highly recommended for family! Good service and friendly staffs!

The place looked great with lots of cartoon character figures around. I was shown to a chosen table which I later found that the chair had oily stains on.Quite a lot of choices on the menu. Prices were more on the high sides. Wonder Woman's Box Office Power Drink ($10.90++)An ice-blended beverage created with all-time favourite salted caramel popcorn flavourThe drink was quite sweet and lacking of the popcorn taste whichone was expecting. Instead it tasted more like oreo cookie. Maybe it should have a change of description.Paradise Island Mac & Cheese (S$18.90++)Conchiglie rigate baked in special 5 cheese sauce and mentaiko sauce, flavoured with white button mushrooms , turkey bacon and garlicMy first choice was pancake but I was informed it was not available more than 10 minutes after I had placed my order. The pasta was well cooked and flavourful, although one could not taste the 5 distinct taste of cheese nor the pollack roe which was commonly found in mentaiko sauce. The dish itself was a tab dry. Didn't really found any garlic, but there was shrimps in it. Needed another change of description here
5
Damn i love this cafe! The foods, the display, the comfort. Must try for all DC fans out there. Cheers
5
Awesome atmosphere with everything DC themed. The furniture and wall decorations are DC themed, the menus were incorporated with retro DC comics and the food was themed to every DC superhero. The food was a bit pricy but you go there for the atmosphere and to take pictures with statues of your favourite superheroes. The staff was very friendly and talkative and helped me out with what to choose from the menu.
5
They sell good food with unique presentation, the service re also very good! Mostly i love their ice cream

5
This place is great! The food is delicious, a good variety of choices from burgers to truffle pasta. I got the cheesy bat rice and it was amazing! The price is fair for the portion and everything is themed with adorable logo cutouts. I also got the wonder woman elder flower drink which was also very good. The service is great! Very friendly and they speak english
5
Really enjoyed eating here for the first time. The food was delicious and Phyllis, our server, was great

Hubby and I love superheroes and we nerded out from the moment they gave us the menu. Food was good. Great portions! A little pricey for what you get, but honestly you pay for the ambience.
5
Our family had enjoyed time spend in this restaurant. The kids loved the meals with hero characters like Superman and Joker :D . Special thanks for Phyllis for the best service.
5
My 2nd time here and the service just got even better. Super friendly servers. The food was served fast enough before my kids get anxious of waiting. We didn't wait for a table at all. Food was yummy and my kids live it!! They provide reading magazine/comics for reading pleasure while waiting. Will definitely come back again.
5
What a fun cafe to visit! Staff were very informative and friendly.Food was delicious and we lived the little Batman food shapes. Highly recommend

The service is Good, food is nice. Would comeback soon! I like marvel characters, wonder woman is very pretty. I love superman and batman
5
I suddenly saw this cafe inside the Marina Bay Sands Mall and I was immediately attracted by it. We went in and ordered food, go around the cafe and it didn't dissapoint us. The food and the ambiance is really great and one of a kind experience especially for food and DC lovers out there!
5
Love the place and the milkshake! It's on the topmost floor of the Marina Sand Bay mall. You"ll never miss it. There's a lot of life size action figures of Superman, Wonderwoman, Batman etc. We took a lot of pictures.I would love to go back to this place

Very detailed food decorations. On the bun and for the dessert. Asked for chocolate ice cream for my waffle but the service staff told me only vanilla and Strawberry flavor is available. I was quite surprised how can they only have 2 types of flavour. I double confirm with the staff again are there only 2 flavours of ice cream in the cafe? She said yes. Anyway, spotted mint flavour for another type of waffle on the menu and I asked her, so why is there mint flavour? Then she finally said I can only choose vanilla or Strawberry for the waffle which I wanted to order. I said I can top up for chocolate ice cream. She then said ok, she will go and check. Finally she came back to say that I have to top up $5 for chocolate. No choice since that's the only flavour I take. Not very satisfied with the service. Cos it seems like she is not incline to give what the customer wants but only what they offer. Give us an option, and let us decide what we want. Anyway, they offered a complimentary ice cream for my kid. Menu is quite expensive. I'll go back and try other food
4
Theme is awesome. Vegetarian options really good. Great place for kids. Desserts incredible. It will make you feel like a super hero!
5
I heard about this place and was super excited to visit. I didn't have high expectations for the food because I assumed it was a themed restaurants, but the food was amazing!! Everything about this place is awesome

5
Superb ambience and my daughter simply enjoy it. Food are tasty and we even ordered 2nd servicing (Aglio Oli).Staffs are thoughtful and even a cupcake for Father's Day.We will definitely visit again!
3
Love the interior & fun DC ambiance. Food was nice but doesnt hv enough variety. And the price tag, GOSH! But there are some killer merchandise items
5
A great night out for young and the not so young. My family loved our visit. Try and get a superhero booth if you can. Sup and phylis were fantastic attendants who looked after us well. Great food too
4
Brilliant staff, especially Phyllis, who really helped my son feel great about choosing the cafe for his birthday celebration. Food was mostly good. The aglio olio pasta with prawns was particularly good as was thee Dark Knight burger. Presentation for the burger was particularly interesting for my son. All in all, a nice memorable meal in a lovely setting.
5
Enjoyable visit! Prompt service and my niece enjoyed her oreo milkshake very much! Foods portion was generous. The batman burger is tasty! :)
4
My friend and I took an Oreo Milkshake and a fruity dessert. It was really good, and well presented. It is a great place to have a reflecting drink in Marina Bay areas. The service was very good (thanks Phyllis!). It can be a little bit expensive, but it stays in the price range in the Marina Bay Area.
5
We had an amazing time together. It was our first time here and it was truly a fantastic experience. The lava cake and superman burger was really good. Would like to thank Phoebe and Phyllis for their patience and amazing service!! Thank you!
5
We had an amazing time at the cafe. The food was really good and the service was fantastic. Especially would like to mention Phyllis and Phoebe for their patience and attention given to us. Thank you so much guys.. see you soon!

I went here with my partner to just have something pretty filling. I feel like it's mostly a novalty. Our food came out roughly the same time (my steak came out first, which wasn't hot) then my partners burger perhaps 5 minutes later. The veggies had dressing on them which I wasn't really a fan of so I didn't eat them. The mash had was quite oily as well. Service is good, it's very tidy and well presented with friendly staff. But I'd recommend else where for foo
5
The burger & the nacho are great. Leoren & phyllis provide excellent service. The food portion is quite bi
4
Great themed American style food. Had quesadilla and mini burgers, both very nice. Great service - thanks Phyllis
5
Delicious lunch at the DC Comics Superhero Cafe, so much food we couldn't finish our meals! Loved the burger being served in a batman box, and the kids chocolate milkshakes were the best thing ever!
5
My kids are crazy over DC superheroes and we decided to drop by for dinner during our hotel staycation nearby. We came right after watching the wonder woman movie! Service is prompt and their food is tasty and very Instagram worthy as well, definitely a nice place to hang out with friends and family
4
Awesome themed cafe if you are a DC fan!Decor and surprising the food are all DC themed. It's a must try for DC fans especially if you are stoked by the Wonder Woman movie recently.
4
The superheros decor and colourful presentation of food attracted the kids to make us step in for lunch. We were surprised by the generous portion of food, even for kids meal. The decor and serving size does kind of makes up for the slightly costly menu. The burger was moist and juicy with a huge beef patty. My boy was disappointed that the pancake was not available. With the hot weather and food price, serving of iced water would be something the management can consider.
5
We came here to visit the DC comic store and ended up eating lunch at the cafe. The cafe is nicely decorated and has a vast range of food. Portion sizes are massive so don't come in on an empty stomach! It is well worth the price. We had 2 lovely servers, Phylis and Cindy, who even offered to pack up our food as takeaway, as we had hungry eyes and over ordered. Would recommend for the novelty of it and also the food.
5
This is one of our favourite restaurants and we end up visiting at least once a month! A bit of a wait to get a seat esp weekends and probably a bit on the pricier side but it's worth it for the smiles it brings to the kids' faces! Awesome menu catering to the fanboys complete with comics and trivia, dishes are extensive and pretty decent and hearty too! We are fans of their steaks, chicken wings and linguine :) the desserts seem amazing but we usually never have space for it! And special mention and thanks to their friendly staff who always make us few at home: Phyllis, Leorenn, Zheng Yi, Julie and Howard! - Purnima, Singapore
5
They serve foods at a big portion and i really appreciate that, although the price is quite hefty it was well worth considering that the food portion is big and they decorate it nicely
5
The experience was great with friendly staff, the food was lovely and more than enough in portion size. The cocktails were the highlight and they were consumed too quickly
5
Ample food portions and family friendly. Service staff Phylis was attentive to our needs. Would recommend visiting again
5
Very helpful and comfort service, food was brought after order relatively fast. Great food and amazing working staff. Will most definitely recommend this cafe
5
Happy to have visited. The staff were very attentive and friendly. Even volunteered to help us take family photo. The meal we had was awesome. Interestingly, the menu already entertained us as we waited for our orders. Overall, we thought that it was worth the stay with the superheroes!
5
Fantastic experience ! Loved Phyllis and julies's hospitality ! Lovely food . Great portions. The decor and presentation is to die fo

Good food, super heros service, I've a good rest from afternoon hot sun. Can do with more main course variety thou
5
Nice ambience, yummy food and drinks - all incorporating the superheroes theme well. Service was great as well, especially the lovely Phyllis who was serving us
5
We wanted to visit the Skypark during our transit in Changi. This place did NOT disappoint us from the ambience to the food selection and great service.Fun food selection for the kids and gourmet pasta and salad for the adults - all marked with super hero character emblem.We decided to have dessert - brownie and Black Forest ( forgot the super hero name for both) and they were yummy.Staff were friendly and attentive to our every need.Check out picture of their yummy food 
5
Perfect DC theme venue in a great location (MBS, Singapore) and mouth watering food. We just concluded a birthday dinner for our son who turned 4 and he loved every moment of the dinner celebration. Batman food with Batman cutlery and the list goes on and on. Everything we tasted was delicious and to top it all the deserts were even better! A special thanks to Phylis and Sean for their service through the night with a lot of personal care and attention and make this night memorable. Can't wait to get back here 
5
Great fun food and excellent theme oriented ambience. Have paid a lot of attention to detail. Definitely worth coming over. Very child friendly as well. Phylis was excellent and gave a lot of attention to our L'il one
5
Very friendly service. Great food and a fantastic atmosphere. :)The cafe & restaurant has a great atmosphere for DC Comic enthusiasts. The restaurant is great for families with children and youngsters

5
Presentation is amazing and the food is to die for. The ambience is just great. DC lovers... go for it :)
5
good food the seafood pasta is great. Really love the environment here. Will come back again for sure
5
Servers here are super friendly. The food here has big servings and tasted great. Being a big comic geek, the place made me feel so ecstatic. We even met a fellow filipino server, Leoren, and she was super friendly
5
I love the food but I want to see Gal Gadot. The service is very good and the design of the place is extraordinary. I'd come visit this place again :
5
I've always had the perception of a themed cafe being just a cafe with expensive food, average taste and presenting just logos on food, but DC Super Heroes Cafe definitely fared better than any other themed cafes out there. Service was prompt and efficient - staff members were courteous and friendly, and even checked on our table if the food was okay. Food wise, was nicely presented and tasted really delicious. It's not just your average theme cafe food but it's really worth coming down to MBS just to have a meal here. Personally don't find it expensive since the portions are rather big too. Would be sure to return again with my friends next time
5
Great food selection. We ordered nacho French fries with cheese and ketchup dips, spaghetti with meatballs, fish dips, and salads and we loved it. We also ordered some rare beer varieties and cider and it was refreshing. We will come back again for sure.
5
Great place! Great food! Excellent service by Leoren! Will definitely come back and bring our kids here!
5
Knowing that my son's fave character (at this point) is batman, I brought him to DC to enjoy some stuff. Pleasantly surprised that there's quite a number of options! We ordered the chicken hawk quesadilla, robin's seasoned fries, batman's truffle pasta and aquaman's friends with fish and chips.Enjoyed the pasta the best followed by quesadilla. The pasta was so creamy and the prawns were fresh! The fish were a bit dry for me but the kids love it. They happily obliged to our request of fries without salt. For my sweet birthday boy - a cup of double chocolate mocha shake and a batman's gritty gotham brownie! Best part is that they even gave him a special birthday gift. Very thoughtful!Will be back for my second boy's birthday. Definitely.
5
I love the theme ,the set up ..the meals are superb..we really enjoy the place as I I'm fan of super heroes ..My partner super like it she ate the whole burger by herself hahahah

Visited the cafe with the family. The cafe is family friendly with kids meal which appealed to the kids.What impressed us was the excellent service rendered by the Manager, Grant and his crew, Ms Leoren. When my son vomited, they were very quick to offer their help to clean up where we sat, the high chair and the floor. The manager also took his initiative to offer my Son a warm class of water to soothe his stomach.As it was They also asked us if we were celebrating birthday when the kids were sang the birthday song and on their own accord, brought out a birthday cake and sang the birthday song with our family. Their crew offered to take photos for us at various points when they saw us trying to take photos. Even when we requested for cutlery and other items like warm water etc, they patiently assisted us with it and always with smiles on their faces.Keep up the good work

Totally love the ambience and deco of this place! Also, when I asked for a clean piece of the table mat to read from, one of the waitress, Phyllis didn't just give me the replacement, she also gave me the other 2 table mat designs! And her colleague Huang Bin was so patient with us when we were geeking out at the menu and taking our time to place our orders! And the food tantalises the tastebuds too!
5
A rare restaurant that provides customer service beyond the definition of excellence. All the crew are certainly the greatest assets of the company and they are the reasons why my family will come again. Thank you for the great and enjoyable service, especially to Julie, Kalista, and Phyllis

5
Service was fast, food was great and the serving was big. The place is very nice with lots of DC designs, even the food. A must try in MBS!
5
My family were very impressed with this restaurants. My kids love the super heroes deco, and there are free flow of DC comics. The food portions were very generous. And they all taste good. All the staff are friendly and attentive. Special thanks to Phyllis for keep checking on us what we need. Highly recommended
5
Awesome place to dine in and the staffs are all attentive and approachable! Excellent service! ☺

Nice place for family to hangout . food is good and the kids love it .. Excellent service from service staff Julie!

Food taste was Good, creative in food design, although the price was expensive but the taste of the food is excellent
5
Food and atmosphere was excellent! Staff was very friendly. I'm a BIG fan of Wonder Woman, next time I will bring my kids
5
This restaurant is super creative in how they serve their meals. The staff was very friendly and super helpful. I had the chicken quesadilla and it was really good!! If I had kids I would definitely bring them here.
5
Awesome food and drinks. Service was quick even when we ordered the chicken on waffles - which we would definitely recommend (as a sharing dish). The staff are very lovely and friendly. Thank you for great service Phylis and Leorenn :)

Me and my comic loving boyfriend visited the Cafe as a treat whilst we are travelling. We were super hungry and definitely under estimated how big the portion sizes where so if you're scared about how pricey it is you are definitely getting value for your money. Within 5 mins of ordering our starters arrived and 15 mins later we were upgraded to a booth because all of our food didn't fit on our 2 persons table haha ! The chili cheese fries is a must and defo grab a milkshake! Our waitress was Phyllis who was always on hand if we needed anything and made sure all our food was out on time - Great service and a great smile from her !! Thanks guys we will definitely be back in the future!
5
The cafe is decorated so well every where with DC super heroes. The food and drinks are really delicious. The staff are friendly and offer great service.
5
Got caught in the rain outaide Marina Bay Sands. So glad we did or we would never have run inside to find this amazing cafe/shop!! Excellent service and amazing food!On first glance i mistook Phoebe our waitress for Wonder Women.
5
Huge serving, great food, and the details they put in to add that "superhero" touch is truly impressive - from the comic book style menu to their food and drinks. My husband had the Dark Knight burger, and I had the Superman hotdog and they were HUGE. Fit for those with Super appetite (or super hungry). Even the kids meal (mac & cheese) were too much for our daughter to finish. Drinks were served in caped cups (my husband got a Wonderwoman cup for his Superman iced tea though, lol). Our daughter loved the Wonderwoman 3D Ice Cream Bars -- those ice cream bars are the first thing that caught every kid's attention, who dropped by the place. They even gave a free souvenir, our daughter was over the moon!Friendly attendants, and quick service.The place can get crowded, so the Quandoo reservation helped us get a table
5
Excellent restaurant for the kids. They enjoy very much the atmosphere.They provide comics for the kid to read. We ordered three different meals at lunch, spaghetti bolognaise mac & cheese, and nachos.The meals arrived quicky, that made my kids happy.Leoren was very helpful for us.Keep up your good work
5
Attended the superhero cafe today and we tried the Dark Knight burger with a wagu patty and portobello mushroom, super tasty! As was the Batman's big city burger. The Batsy Oreo milkshake was creamy and came in a wicked glass with a cape. On top of all that Phyllis provided fabulous service!
5
This cafe is amazing, it is amazing hereEven tho they made incorrect names of characters It's still amazing place to go toLeoren is very helpful, glad she was there to help usIt has delicious food based on D.C. CharactersEven Aquaman waterNo joke!Great Cafe in Singapor

Great place... great concept... so much choice on the menu.. specialist drinks smoothes, burgers, salads, pastas..... Will visit agai
5
I came to Singapore as part of the EU business mission representing Cognicor. I stumbled upon DC comics Superheroes cafe during my Singapore visit. I have to say it was a good thing I did as their food variants are the most delicious and yummy that I have ever tasted. Their service made me feel like royalty. Be sure to stop by this place if you go to Marina Bay mall, Singapore
5
I will definitely recommend this place. Good food, excellent service and nice decor according the superhero-theme.
5
The kids had a great time and enjoyed e food very much. We were served by Phyllis and excellent service from her. Kiddos mentioned that e place was cool and they 100% want to come back again. We'll be back
5
I had my birthday celebration at this restaurant. The staffs was friendly, service was top notch, food is perfect. After learning that it was my birthday, the staff even gave me a small souvenir and that was a small big really touching gesture. I had 2 kids, 5years and 2 years old. They enjoyed their time there and they were also given super hero lollipop. Awesome and I would definitely recommend this place for all kinds of occasions. Will be returning for more enjoyable time.
5
Perfect!!!Perfect food, awsome service! Amazing for geek and super heroes fans.nice drinks with caracters. Must go place. Great decoratio
5
the staffs are very friendly and service were very good and attentive. we truly enjoyed our first experience here. thumbs up!

The burger was delicioso. If you are a Marvel fan, this is a must-visit. The staff named Leoren was so kind to us and was very helpful when my son spilled his glass of juice! Thanks to her excellent service
4
Great service and good food! I like the batman coffee. My two babies love this place, highly recommend for families
5
Food is good. Customer service is even better! Highly recommend the roast chicken! Giving you comics to read, Very kids friendly
5
What can you say. Something so restively simplistic takes on an amazing new life with everything from the menu as a comic book to wonder woman's wings on the cocktail cup. First class setting and the food will not disappoint either in the quality or quantity of it and the settings. So glad we made this a stop in Singapore.
5
Very baby friendly restaurant and plenty of food selection. you get to read comics here too! special shoutout to Phylis & Sukh for giving such great service! great picture op too!
4
Enjoyed the trip down to the D.C. Comics Super Heroes Cafe. The place had a nice ambience, interesting decor and good food presented in an appetizing way.
5
Food was good !! Service was great and staff was helpful!! The family had a good time and enjoyed the place and enviroment. Will visit again !
5
Nicely decorated cafe with yummy food , Crew phylis were friendly and responsive she even took the initiative to refill water for my tea . Would definitely recommend this cafe to everyone .

Great restaurant! Nice ambience, super huge servings of food plus customer service is the best! Shout out to Phylis who served us with a smile

It's my first time coming at DC Superhero cafe! This place such a very cool restaurant with nice decoration by many superheroes comic inside. I tried Blueberry juice and red velvet cake, all ais good. Thanks
5
Staff were super friendly, food was excellent and the cafe itself was decked with awesome super hero paraphernalia. 10/10 would visit again
4
The place itself is very interesting. It will take you awhile to order as the menu will veer away your attention from the food itself.Service is good too! Phyllis attended to us and she did a great job! I'll bring more friends who will visit me in Singapore next time
5
Great service from rica and leoren . Big portions of food. If you like dc you would like this place! 😀👍👍
5
Great food.. good spread and wonderful ambience Worth a good time with family. Leoren was awesome and prompt in her attentio

Brilliantly themed restaurant, a great little stop for anyone who's a superhero fan. The food is basic but fun with a broad selection to choose from.
5
It was a awesome dinner there. My kids loved the food a lot! Of course the superheroes as well. If you come to marina bay sands this is the restaurant you shouldn't miss. The service is very good too the staffs are very friendly and the kids loved them eap. Our waitress Phyllis she is super friendly and very good service. Highly recommended
5
It's my first time visiting the DC Comics Super Hero cafe. Not only it's located in the best hotel in Singapore Marina Bay Sands, the restaurant was very comfortable beautiful and filled with my favourite DC characters!The food was nice (I had a Batman burger which tasted great!) and the staff (one of them was Phylis who I liked her the most ) was professional and super friendly and helped us took a lot of pictures! I would definitely come back and recommend this restaurant to my friends!
5
Delicious food and cool theme if you have time to visit. We went after our stay at the Sands, and really enjoyed it. Phylis is a fantastic server and took lots of photos of us! :)
5
Good food, beautiful setting, and super service. Phylis and Lucy are attentive. They make our first trip to the restaurant wonderful
5
Try the superman quesadilla.. it's yummm.. good ambience to get immersed in the DC craze and learn fun facts about DC characters..Good service too.

Loved this superhero cafe. The food was amazing. The service was also amazing. I was served by Phylis who was excellent. Great to bring the kids too and the shop next to it has amazing gifts.
5
We love the warm service from miss phyllis..she gave us the best service for my little girl, give her everything about wonder womens that she love so much. Definitely will come back again
5
Was there with the family after visiting art science museum. Enjoyed the deco and food which was all in super heros theme (yes even the baby chair is themed). Of course Phylis and her team's service was very accommodating as well
5
First time being here - DC comics Super heroes cafe. Excellence services, friendly and good food! Best is my kid like it!
5
This is our third visit to the cafe, and we are always wowed by the extensive menu. The food is pretty good, and service from Phylis and the set of crew was excellent. My child was very amused with the kids menu, and he loves reading through the regular menu as if it was a comic book. This would be a regular joint for us if we do come over to MBS
5
Very entertaining family restaurant wth a great selection on food and drinks. Very child friendly and great gifts to purchase too.
5
I wish they have same outlets in Phnom Penh in future. U can bring your whole family to have a good times!
4
Food was very satisfying and very tasty! Service was excellent! Special mention to Service Crew Phylis who was very receptive to my needs! Will definitely come back here with friends and family! Enjoying food and the ambiance of being a kid again!
5
Fantastic food, atmosphere at D.C. Super hero's cafe in Singapore ✅will gladly reckon end this to anyone wishing a lovely light lunch or just a snack for you and the kids
5
The food very delicious and the staff are very friendly ❤️❤️Will come more oftenThanks to all staf
5
Restaurant is a must go for dc comics fans. The place is surrounded with everything dc comics related. My daughter loves coming here. We especially love the smallville original. The portions are huge. Drinks have also got their own unique names. Great service. Special thanks to Phyllis, who was very friendly and helpful.Will definitely return.
2
This place had no clear system and you have some customers queuing up while others walks right in and grab empty seats. I was surprised those in the queues were so calm. Having seen the situation, we opted to just buy some to-go stuff for our kids instead of having a full meal there. Place is painfully under-staffed with the team multitasking e.g. the lone cashier was also serving and preparing to-go items like ice-creams, hot-dog sets etc. We only ended up with themed ice-cream and a hot-dog set (served by the multi-tasking cashier) and the wait was pretty long but she was trying her best to juggle the queue and managing the orders. For the level of service and the quality of product, the price is certainly not worth it
5
Nice food and excellent services the food all is excellent above of my expectation and the service is fas
5
The food is delicious and the service is really great espeacially Phylis and Grant they are very friendly.We enjoy the meal at this place very much
5
The atmosphere of the restaurant is good. The food looks cool and delicious. Phylis and Grant are also very friendly and cute
5
Great scenery. Amazing food. Worth every penny. Staff were very welcoming. Would highly reccomend geeks. Familys and any one who likes good food and dc comic
5
We came here as a group for a special occasion and booked a table. It's a really fun place to hang out, great decor. I had the special edition Wonder Woman burgers that are a new addition to the menu. It was really tasty, although didn't come with any sides. One of our servers, Phyllis was very attentive and was very happy to take feedback on our meal and gave me a free side salad and nachos to go with the burgers. We had a great time and will come back again.
5
A kids friendly restaurant. Attentative service by Rica and Phylis. Large servings for a hungry family. Will definitely return to try other dishes.
5
I love it when they checked in with our table to ensure everything is alright after the food is served and if the food is ok to our liking. Being a first timer here, they definitely exceeded my expectations. Defo coming back here. Special shout out to Phylis and Rica. :
5
Our 1st visit here at DC comics Superheros cafe! The theme Cafe deco and food was great! Staff were attentive. Got a little Mother's Day surprise!! Our kids enjoyed the cake. Awesome!
5
Fun place to have gathering for children. Food portion is Super big. Customer Service is good and waitress is very friendly. Will come again.
5
great food with even greater service by the crews, especially Phylis, constantly asking if there is any problems with the food! :)
5
I love the food here! It's super delicious and the drink was superb. The service here is really good and super friendly especially phylis
4
The waiters were all very friendly and professional. Able to balance between being enthusiastic about the DC heros and at the same time able to recommend good food and drinks
5
Excellent experience. My nephew 8, my children 7 and 4 - all really enjoyed their dinner. The kids menu was amazing and just the right quantity. The waitress Lucy and Phyllis were very friendly.
4
We visited this restaurant whilst on business in Singapore as both myself and my colleague I was with are superhero fans decided to give it a go.The decor is great we had a superwoman both all themed to this and all the menus come in a comic theme. Food very western fast food menu.Alcohol is available here and we had two superhero cocktails which were 18 sing dollars each which for Singapore was not bad.I ordered the steak which was cooked to order and came as asked at medium with good mash potatoes and good selection of vegetables in a good sauce. My colleague has schnitzel with chips in a very good sauce.Deserts has a huge choice we opted for slices of superhero cakes which was giant slice of Black Forest gateau and rainbow iced sponge cake all very good.Not cheap to eat here but it is in the Sands shopping centre . Them of the place is fab food not bad service could have been better hence four instead of five rating , if you are a fan of superheroes this place worth a go .
5
The food are very good and appetizing! The staffs are very friendly. We will surely come back again
5
Decided to go here for lunch when visiting Marina Bay Sands. Food was great, staff were very helpful and friendly
4
Honestly this place was fine, it is expensive but Western food tends to be here - plus you need to remember it is located in the Marina Bay Sands shopping centre. We ordered some burgers, curly fries (definitely get these, they were a stand out) and glamorous milkshakes with all the trimmings. The burgers tasted good and looked like the pictures. The service was great and on a week day it was pretty much empty - no need to line up. While the flavour of the shakes and burger were good they weren't amazing or anything to write home about but that's not the point of this place. The atmosphere and novelty of it all is what you're paying for and we honestly had a lot of fun. It was a great lunch and I was full afterwards. Was it expensive, yes, but it was a good meal and the servers were attentive. Oh it may take a little while for your meal, like 10-15 mins but there's so much to look at and read in the menu I didn't notice it. Also for those complaining about the batman burger - it comes in two types, one with the processed patty and the other with the wagyu beef patty however they are about $10 different in price - the more expensive one also comes on the cool black batman plate, the cheaper one on the round white plate. It's quite clear on the menu so people shouldn't be complaining about that as you get what you pay for! (We had the cheap one and it was fine!) After reading some of the negative reviews and giving this place a go anyway I'm glad I did, because people are being overly negative when it's really a good little cafe when you know what you're getting
5
My daughter is into superheroes thus we went for lunch there. The ambiance is great, deco is super cool and food was absolutely fantastic not to mention the staff was awesome nice considering my toddler was throwing a fit for few minutes. The crew who attended to us in our table, Phylis, was exceptionally caring and provided us wondeful service. Kudos to the team and cafe managed by Grant. Great job to everyone!We'll definitely be back and highly recommended
5
Fantastic coffee, awesome chips and lovely staff. There was a great atmosphere and the service was great. Dc comic nirvana
5
This is a Super Hero themed cafe and when I say Super Hero, everything is themed down to the bottled water and glasses donned with capes! We celebrated my son's 6th birthday here and it was a blast. Delicious food, with a batman burger, steak cooked to perfection and green lantern wrap! Desert was a batman cupcake which came with a candle and a birthday song from the friendly staff. We have been back three times during our two weeks in Singapore, and I must say that the service is top notch. The staff are friendly and attentive. The decor takes you back to your childhood, they even have story books to read while you wait for your meal. Thoroughly enjoyed our experience, thank you DC Comics Super Hero Cafe! We'll be back
4
Husband and I visited here to see what all the fuss was about. It's a fun cafe with a memorabilia shop next door. They were just opening as we arrived so we didn't eat in the cafe but we had a look round the shop. Worth visiting to take pictures but the souvenirs and products in the shop were very expensive so we didn't purchase anything. A cool photo op for kids and adults though!
5
Awesome food and service. Phylis is so attentive. I will visit this place when I visit Singapore again.
4
Went there with the family and it has everything for superhero buffs. My son's salmon burger was a little raw but staff, Grant was quick to ensure it was rectified. Will return again
5
The serving sizes are commensurate to price and taste. Worth to visit with friends and family. We will definitely visit again
1
We went here with family, we were 4 adults and 1 toddler. We are all super hero fans.We Just ordered 1 chicken wrap, fries and a drink because all just had lunch. We were there just to experience the cafe and take.pictures.We were served with uninterested waitress. We were given a ketchup in a small container/plate, it wasnt enough for the fries we ordered so i asked for more. They gave another ketchup again in a 1 small container.I just find it weird for a cafe like this and for the price they seemed to be unwilling to give ketchup.So weird.The waitress also gave it with a frown on her face...too bad, i forgot her name.My sister also forgot her phone on our table...we were just in front of the resto taking pictures and then left the place just a couple of steps.No one came to give the phone back to us..we were the only customer in that inside corner...they knew the phone belongs to one of us...When my sister went back to check for her phone, the waitress already cleared the table..The phone was already kept by them on the other table...I wonder how they manage left belongings in this cafe....I hope the management will do something about their bored uninterested waitresses.Total let down for a cafe like this. Food is ok.their services sucks.Go elsewhere to dine.If you enjoy superheroes, just have your picture taken in front of the resto..
3
Just went here to grab 2 coffees after lunch elsewhere. The theme is fun, the drinks were really sweet, but where else does your coffee come with a cape? Service however was pretty slow. I think this is probably somewhere for the experience rather than the food/drink quality
5
We were in search of a place to eat on a busy saturday evening. The Super Heroes Cafe captured our attention. It unleashed the child in us. Ordering food was fun too. It brought back memories of reading a comic book. The food is pricey but the serving is for big appetite. The dish we ordered was plated with a super heroes theme. We left with our eyes and our tummies full.
2
We took my 5 year old grandson. The staff seemed a little disinterested and the food was pretty blah. Certainly we don't mind paying for a fun experience but this is just an expensive mediocre meal with a couple of batman logos on it! Go look, take a couple of photos and buy an ice cream/cupcake from the outside stand.
2
For a superhero friends you might craving for this just like me. After visiting this cafe, the superheros decoration on the food and at the shop were just normal. Don't expect too much. Price is expensive, for just a simple western cuisine. Food were just normal. You might able to find better food out there.This is just another normal cafe with a theme like any other shops out there, price is definitely not worth i
4
We ordered the carbonara pasta, and a veggie pancake with mango mousse cake. Pasta and pancake tasted okay but the cake wasn't up to standard. One highlight of the restaurant is the menu which was designed like a comic book. Quite interesting to read and the interior decoration looks great
3
Food is average, nothing special. The cafe is more of a gimmick for kids. $ value is slightly on the high side. Can try just for the experience.
4
My daughter had a ball at this quickly little cafe. If you or your children love superheroes and/or comic books, this is a great little spot to enjoy a coffee.The coffee is good and setting excellent. I can certainly recommend a quick visit
4
Food items too pricey. Service was excellent and food was served fast within 20mins waiting time. Luckily we make reservation, as crowd started to flown in around dinner time
4
During our recent visit to Singapore we came across something touristy, It was exactly what we need. Lunch with a splash of fun. The menu was unique, every superhero had their name mentioned in the menu. I really liked the Joker beverage (please see below). Presentation is everything here at the DC comics Super Heroes CafÃ©
3
It's will be my first and last to patrolnise Super heros cafe.The ambience is nice but the foods are overprice. Food is of average taste, I feel I am paying too much for the food. variety of food is not a lot although the menu is a thick book.It will be good to lower the price and more variety of dishes
3
I was drawn to this restaurant due to it's DC Comic book theme. There is lots of memorabilia around the cafe and the menu is cleverly constructed so that each dish mimics a superhero. I had Aquaman's Marinara. Once I tasted the food it was clear that this is a novelty cafe and the focus is not on the quality or tastiness of the food. This would be a great experience for kids, however, I will not be returning
3
Visited with two boys aged 7 and 9 who thought it was great. We sat in the flash booth so made their day, however with two plain eaters meal choice was tricky (all burgers on black bread which I don't think many children would eat). staff were not all interested in us but not rude either and food was just ok
4
If you like DC's super heroes, then you'll like this place. It has a great theme, lots to choose from and caters for the comic book/film geek in us all. It isn't cheap and the quality is very average, but hey, that's not why you go. You can sit in the restaurant or get something to go and of course they have a merchandise shop.
3
The Menu's and food created and interesting and unique experience but even by Singapore standards I thought they were expensive and the service wasn't that great.
4
Checked out this themed cafe with colleagues on a weekday. Fairly quiet then, and service acceptable. The menu is interesting with all the superhero themes, though I won't say that the variety of choices was all that wide.When the food was served, the portions turned out to be not-so-big, considering the price. But to my surprise, it all tasted very good -- pardon me as I have experiences of themed cafes usually serving nice-looking but horrible-tasting food and such. So the quality of the food here surprised.Having said that, I'm quite frankly not likely to go back, unless it's for some special gathering with friends or similar. The prices are pretty steep, and the portions are just not worth the price
4
Plenty of menu choices, average prices, staff friendly and service prompt. Good serving sizes. Merchandise shop have very small collection
3
We visited primarily for the benefit of my 11 year old son and this is the age group the restaurant is firmly aimed at. Everything has a D.C. superhero theme from the drinks to the meals and all the memorabilia. Food itself was very average but good fun. Service was rather haphazard at best - slow and inaccurate (bill was incorrect too so pays to check!). Fun if you have kids into the superhero comic scene but not for any other reason.
5
Nice food and drinks. Nice ambience based on super heros.Very busy place, we waited 15 mins outside to get i
2
This is a restaurant in a very pricey section of real estate. It's appeal is that it is a representation of DC comic characters. The store, dessert bar, and restaurant occupies a lot of space. Food is just barely OK and very expensive for what you get. My burger came sopping (along with the fried egg I asked them to leave off...) Prawns were still in the shell in the pasta-really? Fish and chips were acceptable. Staff- nice but immature. Bill immense. The store overcharges an outrageously. T shirts are like 50 to 75 bucks. Buy similar products for 10 bucks on Amazon. On top of that, we could not find anything in our daughters size. Major disappointment
5
 we brought the kids here for an early dinner, and they loved it!! the variety of food types are great, with so many to choose from. my mrs ordered the BvS Batman's Truffle Pasta (squid ink linguine with truffle sauce) and it looks good!! i just orderd the Alfred's Parmesan Truffle fries - great! Its a fun place to go if you are a DC Comics fans and bring along the kids..
3
Very much in theme... with lifesize Batman, Batwoman, Joker, Superman standing guard while you dine. Oh... Bat vehicles are also on the driveway.More a DC Heroes Hall of Fame, very much a mini theme gallery, less of a diner.Why? Because instead of being culinary heroes, the chicken dishes we had behaved like Jokers.... decisively fighting back. Wham #@! Sock..Oompphh!!Fancy decor. Imaginative menu billings. Did we forget we are serving food and beverage? Holy Oversight!!
2
Themed cafe and restaurant (with retail store) at Marina Bay Shoppes. We were exploring the Shoppes and stopped by the cafe to grab a drink and allow my son to indulge in his interest in superheroes. Despite the interesting sounding drinks, effectively we were served cordial in a fancy glass (cup with a cape) that cost over $10 each. Drink wasn't very good. And we didn't even get to keep the glass. Staff looked bored and disinterested - it felt they were doing me a big favor by serving me. Setting was great - with interesting memorabilia etc on display - but didn't feel that justified the cost. I am happy to pay for good food and service but neither was on display here in my view.
3
Good theme cafe but the food was pretty terrible. Ordered the chicken and no one in our family thought it looked anything like chicken! Service was also pretty poor to be honest. Would not return
4
Batman burger was delicious. I loved the themed food, freak shakes looked amazing but we just couldn't manage one as well
5
When i found out such a place existed in Singapore, i had to come here. Theres a gift shop there which had nice array of products to choose from. When i went to the restaurant, it was lovingly decorated with everything Dc, lots of life size figurines tooThe menu was a comic book which was cool, the food was good, not fantastic, but good enough for me and waa cute how they made each dish DC relatedCome here if your in the neighbourhoo
1
Its expensive in Dollar sense (Chicken Burger at $28) Hot Dog at $19) if the quality of food and service is awesome then yes one can say the price is justified.Unfortunately the food quality is terrible nothing to write home about. The service was slow and laid back. I am giving such a strong recommendation because the parents and kids feel cheated. Parents get their kids with great expectation and feel disappointed and after spending good money parents don't want to see their kids disappointed. By the way water comes at $6 no choice. Just avoid the place you are paying only for the name.
1
Extended family outing for dinner to celebrate one of the kids' birthdays. Consensus was that the food was absolutely awful. Not one of the many dishes we ordered was even close to appetising - most went unfinished. Add to that, prices are pretty steep for what's on offer (as many others have pointed out).The only positives were the setting and the serving staff. Service was prompt and our large order was served without a glitch. The staff themselves were cheerful and very helpful.
3
We ate here on Saturday night 8pm. Food was ok, its a chain type food place, basic menu, all of it was ok. Service was average Drink prices are ridiculous, but this is Singapore, however to refuse to serve tap water and force you to buy expensive water is a outrage. Would not eat here again purely because of this need for greed
4
This is about the coolest cafe I've been to. It's a bit steep price wise, but given its location, that to be expected, we settled on milkshakes and cheesy fries which were great
1
Ok, it is a prety cool place and having the batsignal on your bun is very cool but it cannot compensate fo the taste, price and quality. S$32 for something that wasnt even a burger. Looked and tasted lake processed Meat. Take the pictures but eat someplace els
3
I was dubious about going to this restaurant given the mixed reviews on here BUT we went for our kids sake (2 boys age 7 & 9) as they are big super heroes fans (not just DC I have to add!). We went on a Sunday afternoon so the place wasn't that busy - there are 3/4 "booth" type tables which my son wanted to sit in but all were either taken or reserved - (Note to cafe: could do with more of these style tables)- and the table we were offered was right next to the counter & another table where a take-out order was being sorted out so we chose to sit at an alternative table outside on their terrace. Bad move - we sat for a good 15minutes before WE had to ask for our order to be taken....no-on even approached us for a drinks order!Food wise don't even bother looking at the menu on-line as it is NOT the one you get given in the cafe!! The one you get given is a hard-back album with the menu "hidden" between pages of a comic book story...in theory a great idea, practically not so good as it makes it difficult to find what you are looking for & the quality of the books is not great either as they were all falling apart.The kids menu is poor - 4 options, 2 of which contained pasta (not every kids eats pasta!!) - so we ended up ordering from the main menu for our boys. I also do not understand why the kids basics were not on their menu when they were available on the main one - hot dog, chicken "nuggets", fries..We ordered 2 chicken "nuggets" and 2 hot dogs, side of fries, starter of prawn - the fries (which were great by the way - freshly cooked, crispy & hot) came out first, then the mains and lastly the starter!! The chicken didn't go down too well with my kids - poor quality chicken(dark meat as opposed to chicken breast) covered in batter which I assume was supposed to be crispy but was, instead, saturated in fat & over cooked. The pile of fries given with them (no doubt trying to fill the plate as we asked for no salad) was enough to feed all 4 of us! The hot dogs were mildly tasty - would have preferred a standard dog rather than the chicken one tho'. Served with Nachos we obviously got the bottom of the pack as most were broken and my husband's plate had a pile of crumbs on it!The decor is good but VERY distracting for kids (& husbands) who spent more time reading what was on the walls than eating their food! Total bill was about $150 - expensive for what it was.One thing I really liked were the themed cups used for soft drinks so I had a look in the shop attached - couldn't find the exact same ones but the ones I did find were priced at $119!!!!!!!! Outtrageous. A glass was priced at $69.99 - how the shop can justify these prices is totally beyond me - needless to say we went home without our own cups!Won't be back

Went to DC Comic Cafe as we have not been to a comic cafe before. It was really interesting with a small section catered specifically for souvenirs (T-shirts, caps, etc), a cafe section for customers who just want to have a slice of cake or muffin with coffee/tea and a restaurant section with booths and tables for full meals. The menu was like a comic book and thick. Menu is all listed on the right side of the page where else the left is comic strips. There was a lot of Colours and different fonts on the menu and lots of reading to be done. Overall, we had a headache by the 5th page or so. It was one menu with lots of selection of drinks but so so selection of meals. Ended up with Cheese fries, cheese quesadilla and a seafood pasta dish. Fries was dry with two small side batman plates of cheese (which was hard to get at the corners), quesadilla was unappetizing visually and bland on the palate, the seafood pasta was small in portion and taste average. Prices was on the high side. Basically paying for the experience, location, atmosphere and the deco. Would not be going back again. Once is definitely more than enough.

Came here for dinner and ordered 2 types of wings/chicken which are nice. The menu is interesting to look at too. Price though not cheap is still ok compared to other restaurants at MBS.
4
Good food, eye-catching decorations, superb services with friendly smiles, value for money. Worth every dollar spent
3
Ate here late one night when we were staying in Singapore. Good for somewhere different to eat, but you do pay for it.
3
We met up with a friend here on his recommendation, and I certainly enjoyed the Comic Action hero theme around the restaurant with life size statues and even the Menu had a Comic vibe to it, with some unique takes on classics such as a Batman Dark Knight Burger and also plenty of new choices you almost certainly wouldn’t across elsewhere. For the main I opted for the Grilled Angus Ribeye steak, which came with fries and salad. Although well presented, it was quite chewy so either wasn’t cooked particularly well, or the meat was of poor quality, which was a shame given the price. For dessert we shared an extremely large, and I mean jumbo, milkshake with plenty of cream and chocolate toppings such as brownies, pieces of whole chocolate, sprinkles etc which you can just pick off. It was nice, and lots of fun to work though, but obviously way too much for anyone person to have alone
2
Had lunch here with family, food just passable. I understand the 'no tap water' policy, but $6.90 per 500ml of mineral water? That is unconscionable, even for Marina Bay Sands. It's $2 two floors down.
3
A quirky restaurant modelled around a super hero theme (batman , superman etc). Serves US sized fast food such as burgers and hot dogs. Interesting place to visit. Wait staff can get over busy during peak periods so meal times are not short. Food is what you would expect, big fat American fodder. A bit like KFC, visit once a year or so.
3
Menu seemed pretty cool so I ate here for the novelty. This I paid the price for. A shake and some fries set me back $30 plus. Both were average but enjoyable. Service left a bit to be desired. The cheese sauce was the highlight. Happy kids around me everywhere though
4
This cafe is on the top floor of marina mall If you love batman you will love thisThe shop sells merchandise and is nxt to the cafe My kids loved this so after ordering they disappeared into the shopThe burgers have logo on top shaped like a S for superman and bats for batman they also serve them in cool boxes the drinks glasses have little capes You come for the novelty we all loved it
4
Tried the waygu burger, chocolate nutella milkshake, baby potatoes and matcha chocolate for dinner.The 1st three were disappointing.However, on a positive note, superb service and concept.Worth a try for the novelty and fun for kids
5
It was really hot and we were looking for ice cream and found this place in the mall. The ice cream was out of this world!! Must try and eat here
3
I have to admit, I love the interior eventhough there is nothing really special in term of taste.The service isnt bad but the price is pretty high.
3
The menu was novel and it's a good place to go with the kids. The service felt a bit disjointed in that they took our menu away without asking for our order. Otherwise the food was ok, but as my kids like comic books it was worth the premium price
4
Superhero themed foods and drinks- all served up next to lots of hero merchandise, film props etc. Our teenagers loved it, and to the honest, given the location etc, the Batman Brownie and Milkshake (in a glass with a cape!) were not too expensive- we were here just for a dessert though so can't speak for the main course
3
Great concept & a must for fans, but the menu is average & high prices for Singapore. Menu is in a cartoon book, which is novel. Drinks all well presented with themes.cafe. Full of themed merchandise
4
The concept of SHC is impressive: a diner based on DC Comics' global icons - Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, Catwoman and the other members of Justice League, even the newest addition, Suicide Squad.The menu items are decorated with the logos of superheroes. For instance, the bun on my chicken burger had a yellow S logo. The cups and sauce containers are likewise designed based on superhero themes. Even the desserts have interesting packages. The same goes for paintings, photos and other visuals all around the restaurant. Hey, there's even the batmobile and the bat motorcycle. It is such a joy dining in that atmosphere. Food definitely tasted good, aside from looking good. Service was excellent - the attendants were helpful with our orders. They don't over merchandise.Kids will surely enjoy dining here. Kids at heart will do so, too.
5
Best themed cafe. I totally loved it. The interior is great, cutlery, plates, food everything is great. I only found the shop to be a little expensive but still got the batman glass with cape.If you're a Batman or DC super heroes fan this is the place to go. It's located on 3rd floor in Marina Bay Sands shopping centre. 
1
Waiting 40 minutes for one waffle. Water cost 7 SGD for. 0.5L and the personal is slow and really bad service. Over all I will never go here again or recommend anyone to go here
4
Let's face it; the decoration of the place is just great and you will simply love it if you're a fan of super heroes from DC Comics. Each table is dedicated to a super hero (batman, the flash, green lantern...) and so are the meals/drinks.The place is however very expensive so take it as something fun you'll only go once and not a place to go if you're hungry and are looking for great food. The staff was very friendly.The cafe is very easy to find; from the city, take the bridge to the marina bay sands and enter the shopping mall by the left door (the one facing the bridge). The shop will be right in front of you, a level lower.
4
We took the kids here for lunch and it was probably the most expensive meal we had whilst in Singapore. Tax & Service fees aren't included in menu prices so be aware
3
To be fair, the décor and ambience of the café is indeed quite nice. We’re a big group and they put us in a partitioned area recently furnished under the theme of Suicide Squad. All the foods and drinks were sprinkled with comic designs, which made the boys really happy.But the food quality was truly so-so. We only ordered some light snacks but even simple items like French fries were over-cooked and all dried.And, like everything in and around Sands, the place is painfully over-priced. Do drop by if you’re in the area. You can look into the café and check out its merchandize from the outside, just walking by. Grab a drink if you have a few extra bucks to spare. Just don’t bet on being served with delicacies. You should be fine
1
Located at Marina Bay Sands, from far the cafe look cool and fantastic, occupy at least 3 - 4 shops with merchandise.As for the foods and beverages, all are way over price. Nothing special on the food
1
We ordered truffle fries. Unfortunately, one of the fries tasted really bad. (Smells like rat poop!) My husband had to throw-up due to its taste. We informed the waitress and tried the same fries. Within less than 2 secs, she had to throw it up. Here's what their chef said: that's how a truffle fries should taste. Really insulting as this is our 3rd time to eat at the restaurant. During this discussion, the waitress kept on giving me the bill which I paid in full. They thought that we dont want to pay for the food. They should remember that it's not always about the money but how they you treat your customers and the service that you give. This will definitely be my last. Their service doesnt compensate the bill that I paid for!

Honestly this is the worst example of a themed restaurant I have ever visited, in fact it is the worst restaurant I have ever visited. Full stop.Awful awful awful.From the awful looking laminated menus with fuzzy pictures of awful looking food, the terrible descriptions, the high prices. And worst of all the genuinely awful food. Honestly.....Chicken drumlets were just about passable, but too large to be dipped in the sweet chilli sauce thimble like pot they are served with. The blandest of bland chilli loaded potato skins were at least bland enough to be edible. But the dark knight burger. Oh my god.Supposed to be served on a batarang shaped plate (as pictured on the menu) it came on an oval plate. The burger bun is 'charcoal' (black) the burger comes with grey sauce. Can anyone name a food sauce that is grey? By design? No thought not? Grey? What was it? I think it was supposed to be a mushroom sauce? Maybe? But whatever it was it was truly rank. The actual burger patty? Supposed to be wagyu beef? Give me a break! I've had better burgers from vans at the side of dual carriageways in Northamptonshire. It's was absolutely foul. He ate the chips though. You can't really cock up frozen chips can you? Mind you if anyone can, this lot can.Never ever allow your kids to bend your arm for a visit here. Go to the excellent shop. Sure. But give the over priced, dreadfully terribly awful zero starred if I could have given it cafe a wide swerve.DC as a licence owner should hang their head in shame. It's appalling.
1
Absolutely the most despicable restaurant we have ever been to including in our home town. I was so shocked I forgot to write a review until now two months later. I must have tried to blank it out. We only ate there to say we had done it. Every entree we had was awful. There was four of us. Parents and two boys 15 and 18. Some thing they called a quesadilla, I had some kind of shrimp and the boys both has chicken sandwiches. None of us finished our meal. We paid 80 bucks for lunch. The service was terrible. I cannot believe such a place even exists in a country that prides itself on service

I can appreciate a good gimmick. But this was simply a SCAM. They had a unique Harley Quinn MRT cards (passes for public transport here in Singapore) which I knew my teenager would love. They said I could only purchase it as a set with a Joker card for $45!!! I asked to buy only one but they insisted. Then they tried to pitch me the special lanyard as well (luckily I didn't fall for that!), but never bothered to mention the MRT cards had absolutely NO CASH VALUE!! They did go on and on about how the cards were band new and we were the first one in Singapore to have them. (I can be a sucker for the gimmick, as I said). I come home and have a surprise for my teenager. Next day she takes her new pass to come down and meet me at the second day of the event at MBS where DC Comics Super Hero Cafe has their booth. Sadly she was unable to board the bus because her brand new cool Harley Quinn pass purchased at DC Comics Super Heroes Cafe booth had ABSOLUTELY NO CASH VALUE! She calls me, upset- of course. I went back and complained. They told me all kinds of nonsense about how it's just for the cool picture, and if I'd asked they would have told me, blah blah blah. Nobody sells an MRT pass with NO VALUE. It would be like buying and empty bottle of wine at full price just for the label. Food-wise they had cupcakes with Batman and food that looked pretty unappealing. What a joke. Save your hard-earned dollars. Insulting
1
Quite simply shocking, we stopped in Singapore for a few days whilst on route to New Zealand and this one of the our things to do here. Eating out in Singapore is not cheap by any stretch of the imagination and you will easily spend $20-30 for a main course without any side orders and this is no different, i had the Dark Knight burger which was not very nice, the patty was soft and greasy and the charcoal bun was foul. My partner had the chicken quesadilla which was very skinny on the filling and is served on its own so we order fries as a side order which arrived with my main 15 minuets after he had finished his main. To top it off we were given the bill before we had even been served dessert and this was still another 20 minutes after i had finished my main course. To add insult to injury they slap on a mandatory 10% service charge which i wouldn't normally begrudge but seen as the service was so dire i feel this should be optional - all in all if you want a burger and fries stick to golden arches as you know what you get and at least you will save some mone

After spending a long tiring yet fulfilling day at the garden festival, we realised there weren't many options left for dinner since last orders end about 10pm. We decided to try our luck at the Super Hero Cafe located at MBS. Depending on where you are, it takes about 20-30 mins from Gardens by the Bay.We appreciated the late closing of this cafe. We arrived late about 945pm to be warmly greeted by Leoren (hope I spelled her name correctly). She recommended the signature burgers and offered us suggestions in thirst quenching drinks. Even gave us a discount voucher for our subsequent visit. Food was served fast mainly because it's late. However do note that there were several shoppers who walked in and cafe was bustling. Being a theme restaurant, drinks, burgers and decor amplified dc marvel's theme. Do look for Leoren if you are keen for excellent customer service! :) great first impression for first timers!

The food was not even average, it was poor. Taste was bad, portion was small, presentation was lacking, meal options were limited especially more if you are a vegetarian, pricing was extremely steep!!! They can't even make fries properly, it was hard and dry ($9.90). Had their vegetarian quesadilla, horrendous. Their sides of guacamole, sour cream and salsa was soooo little it's barely half of the little containers it came in. The quesadilla looks unappetizing, dry and totally bland. Worse is it costs $17.90!!! My Friend ordered seafood pasta, the portion was really small for the price of $26.90. The menu is extremely confusing to look at. Too much Colours and difficult to read with various font sizes. Basically, it comes like a comic book which was interesting at first but after the first two pages, you will get a migraine. The menu section is all on the right side, left pages are actually comic pages. Service was also average and slightly on the slower side. Nothing to shout about and no proactiveness shown (considering that there weren't many people at the restaurant). They were very quick with the bill though. Overall, it's just a once off experience. Definitely won't be back again. Not worth the money and time
4
The cafe has many DC themed decor and merchandise. The food was ok, only had snacks and drinks. There are two sections of the cafe, one side is a full sit down restaurant and the other side is a snack food area. I would've really liked to try more food in the restaurant side, I only had snacks from the cafe side.The menu looked great, especially the themed names of the dishes
1
Walked into this cafe sat down ordered and 45 minutes later our side order comes without main or drinks?? Asked for this and and waited another 10 minutes then mains come then drinks... Women on a table next to us saying her veg was cold! Staff running around taking people in every 4 seconds.... Service was very poor and to top it all off the Manager was stood in the cafe bar on his mobile phone?!?!?!? Just very disappointed
5
Cafe is quiet good Design is well too,service nice. If you Drink There, Don't forget To Buy Some cartoon Stuff Ther
1
We had the DC Comics Cafe on our must see list with our 2 boys while in singapore however was very disappointed. The main restaurant was closed all day due to a function and the very small cafe when you requested food from the menu it wasn't available. So a cold hotdog that came out just bun and sausage no sauce or anything, and a serve of nuggets and chips and a pie which came out 15 mins after the other meals plus 4 drinks cost over $60 then 4 muffins cost $41 it was very disappointing. Worth walking past and having a milk shake for photos but wouldn't recommend eating there. Plenty of other places to visit on our next trip to singapore
4
I went here with some family from Singapore who recommended it. I'm normally not the comic book type but I thought I'd give it a try. I'm glad I did. The food was quite good and the atmosphere was really fun Kids will love it. Adults will probably love it too
4
We're enjoying our visit to this cafe eventhough it's not speedy serving but gave us enough time to take some pictures before we enjoy the food. Ordered superman hotdog, country chicken and bolognaise. The chicken I ate was so juicy, love the tender meat. Iced mint chococino was lovable. Also we had catwomen's caramel latte and batsy oreo milkshake. All were good.

We have just re-located to Singapore and exploring over the school holidays with my 7 year old son. We were in the local area and I spotted this restaurant in the mall and thought it would be a fun treat for my son. The service was awful......not a smile in sight and food practically thrown at us. My son ordered from the kids menu and I from the regular menu. Our meals arrived 20 minutes apart, despite being straight off the menu with no special requests! Food was tasteless, did look particularly appetising and not great tasting.When I asked for the bill it was shoved towards me and the waitress stood over me like I was going to run off until I placed money in the folder. She took ages to return with the change. I was certainly not going to get bored of waiting for the change given that everything was poor.I then (reluctantly) said to my son he could have an ice cream from the take away freezer that they had. We stood there while 2 people just glared at their mobile phones. I coughed to get their attention and I was glared at. I encourage my son to order and they proceeded to say they did not have any cones. I said to my son we would go elsewhere and they just glared at me. I have been lucky enough to travel and eat in a really variety of places around the world and this has to be the worst for everything. It makes fast food restaurants look superior. While the memorabilia is good to look at save your money
3
Fun for kids to see a batburger or a bun with a big superman S on it, but service was not speedy and prices are quite high. But hey, they have a bat mobile in the foyer, so fans can forgive a lot..
1
DC comics cafe was one place I really wanted to go to . But to my disappointment there was delay in service and food was also not good . I am a vegetarian and the options were really limited .. To be honest there were hardly any . I ordered for a Veg Quesadilla and it was horrible . In the dessert I ordered some ice cream with gummies which was also not good . My overall experience was not nice 
4
Nice enjoyable dinner with family. Food was hot and delicious. Loved their drinks and dessert menu. Overall experience was good .. wish I could bring back their menu as remembrance ... Make your booking unless you are going for early dinner. Pricing is reasonable restaurant pricing ..
3
Menu is comic-book style which adds to the fun factor. This cafe will mostly be enjoyed by kids, whereas adults will find the food pretty average and borderline expensive. There are better western food served elsewhere for common offerings like pasta and burgers.

An old time school mate from Hong Kong decided to swingby Singapore and stayed exclusively on Sentosa. I managed to convince him to visit gardens by the bay before he left. Upon meeting up at Marina bay sands, I picked this theme restaurant assuming it should gel with 3 kids under the age of 10. The idea was welcomed. We walked a good distance passing all other options for lunch with high hopes and expectations on this given choice. What a mistake. First up when we wanted to order, the waitress was clearly uninterested. Her repetitive gesture on pressing the depressing her ballpoint pen repeatedly throughout serve to show her impatience just early moments into the joint. After a regular affair of choices and selection, this rather unfriendly lady did not once smile or showed any form of enthusiasm. I pretty much cease to go further when i asked if we can choose how we like the burgers to be cooked. She looked at me in a blank when I asked if they cook it medium. Throughout the few minutes it was a cold display as if we should have ordered swiftly instead. When asked to borrow a pen, she refused to my amazement. We shook our heads when she left with the order as if we owe her a life debt from the facial expressions. There were large sheet of advertisement used as place mats on the table which are disposable, one of the kids started to draw at the back. Another waitress came to tell us not to draw on the menu itself. In the end we dropped the idea of drawing on anything at the end when the menus remained closed. The food served were not exceptional, neither were they cheap as expected. There was absolutely nothing enticing for a return plainly. When we were done with the main courses. No one asked if we wanted the waffles to be served. We were expecting it to come last and had to remind them. The same way we had to ask for tomato sauce that too were forgotten after a few runs. In the end the waffle took much longer wait than expected. While clearing the plates from the mains, they took the liberty to clear half while the other half remained untouched for reasons unknown. My friends were asking why do they clear things half way if this is a local cultural difference. For 5 adults, 3 kids and a baby in a trolley, $200+ bill, food isn't ground breaking and services leaving much to be desired. A grand mistake on my end for this selection and never again
3
For a cafÃ© it is soooo expensive to eat hear, really just a kids treat and a quick look around. Its on the top level of the shopping centre and has lots of DC stuff. It will cost you and the service is very slow as it is run by kids who don't have a clue
3
Ordered a kid meal for my nephew and he liked it. Ordered Buffalo wings & fries and the quality and taste is average with any other local cafe. The ice cream is good but the cupcake.... please don't waste your money, is as hard as stone and even very hard just to cut if half. The sponge of the cupcake is so dry and you can't eat them using fork as it will break to small pieces, i guest is not fresh and have been there for several days
2
sloppy food, even sloppier service, we had to wave and ask for everything service wise, even when we were virtually the only customers there.Soggy sugery bun burger for 30 dollars and 16 dollar "kids meals" And six dollars for a one dollar coke
4
if you are a superman or a batman fan , do visit. Food is ok. Ice creams are awesome. Merchandise are amazin
5
Really cool makes you feel like a child.. Great set up.. They don't have all the marvel characters on batman and superman but good food fresh straight from the oven
1
We went for lunch, only 5 tables were occupied. At most 15 consumers. It took them 50mn to bring a tiny junior hamburger to my son. Still he was more policy than I who didn't get my meal. People across us were as unlucky as one had finished his lunch when the other got served. It shouldn't call itself a restaurant. Go there, take a picture and move on
4
in the mall - lots of great choices for food and a couple of comic book heaven destinations.. this in one of them
5
We found any western food in Singapore was expensive. Food was great, service was great and love that the menu had all super hero references. They have a shop to purchase merchandise from, great collector items too. We went back a couple of times. This is a must see if you like your super hero'
3
Wow, Batman puns aside. please prepare for the café experience. We had a DC fan in our family so we couldn't miss this café (we tried). The shop next door has an amazing array of merchandise and well worth a look (and a few purchases if you can afford to - we couldn't). The café, as in the cakes and ice-cream section, where we ate, was themed. We stood a little while before being acknowledged at the counter, then we ordered our joker fries and other themed food. As expected you do pay for the theme and the setting. Remember you are in the Marina Bay area. We had a few dishes, the fries being the pick of them. But again, this café is about the DC Comic Book experience, not about the food. Our DC fan, loved the setting, Batman playing on the big screen, the Cat woman life size replica and much more. Very themed, very DC and very expensive...but hey you are only going to do it once :
3
At the request of our student son we ate here on our first night in Singapore.Now, the store, with its models, posters (they have a signed Joker poster by Heath Ledger here) and overall super hero ambience is good. If it's DC world your looking for then this is the place, but don't bother eating here. The food is bland at best, and the cost is quite outrageous. They even made a chocolate shake become tasteless....some skill.Enjoy the store but fill your belly elsewhere
3
My partner and i were wondering around looking for a bite to eat, and spotted this and of course thought it looked cool so why not. When we sat down i regretted it. The menu is not great, you are not spoilt for choice. It is hard to get service, you have to call someone everytime you wanted something. The design of the restaurant was appealing and fun. And the drinks and food were great (to the eye) however the food was not tasty. The burger had a strange taste to me. It was okay to visit, take photos but i wouldn't go back. I would suggest visiting the cafe and getting a drink or a themed cupcake rather then wasting money at the restaurant
3
I'm giving it only average rating as they serve average food overpriced, just because it is "superheroes themed".As a crazy DC and Marvel fan I had to try this place the moment I saw it, of course. The food was ok, drinks, dessert and shakes were very good but place is overpriced (although I was expecting that even if only for the DC branding, so nothing a logical brain would not deduce).If you are going to keep your inner child happy and being able to say you were at a DC superheroes cafe I would recommend to go for the shakes, sweet treats and ice creams area. Prices are more decent and you will leave the place quite happy
3
I am not DC fan so the cafe design and decorations will not really attract me to try. I went there for a celebration with prior reading of a lot of bad review on the food. The food is not cheap, with that I guess a lot of people have higher expectations. Without much expectation when I go there, surprisingly some food taste quite good to us. We did not order the famous burger(my friend said the burger not worth the price), instead I went for the vegetarian quesadilla which tasted good for me. Coffee is standard, no complaint on that. My friend had lobster pasta and taste good too. Cake is a total fail reason being I guess they put on shelf for quite sometime so it was a bit harden. Ondeh ondeh taste fine but the cake is too sweet. The cafe itself is great for photo. Overall, I guess I won't be back as not much excitement when I look at the food menu.
3
Agree with the other reviews that it's expensive and average food. I like the ambience of the place but that's about it. Why do they charge so much for what you get,sorry it is doesn't change there prices I can't see this place lasting as the noveltie will run out fast!
3
It looks great, great concept, attention to detail and the sheer size of it in the mall would all point to this being a super cool restaurant, especially for super hero crazy kids ..... first of all. on entering we met with very lack lustre staff who showed us to our table. The menu is quite limited I thought and there is NO KIDS MENU .... seriously no kids menu in superhero café .... so we finally pick our choices (again very limited for the kids) and when the waiter eventually comes over to us and we tell him our choices he tells us one of them (choice for one child) is sold out .... It would have been a much better idea to tell us this as they handed us the menus so at least we knew not to order it. At this point we just left. Very disappointing. Way overpriced for what essentially is fast food! the ice cream and cupcakes all look great but again sooooo expensive for what they are. I wouldn't be bothered about going back here and wouldn't really recommend i
3
We went to the hero café for lunch while visiting the mall. The cafe is really neat and has tons of cool memorabilia but that were the cool stuff ends. After looking at the menus and seeing the prices we realized we were truly paying for the experience. To start we had the chili cheese fries that were definitely the best part of our meal the jalapeño's really made them great. For our mains I had the Aquaman's marina that was a seafood pasta with a tomato sauce that was alright nothing special. My boyfriend had the suicide squawk that wasn't great. The service wasn't super great and we were a little annoyed because on the mall pamphlet it said they opened at 11am then the mall directory said 10:30am but then when we asked the lady working there she said 11:30am. It was kind of an all an all disappointing experience.
3
This place is in a great location and you can by ample products of your favourite character! All the decorations right down to the fabric on the seats and the cutlery has a character symbol! Amazing dedication! The good was amazing, I had the Batman burger. However, the same with everyone else, the staff are not so great. It feels as if the staff have just entered waiting and have no idea what they are doing. The waiter got the table numbers wrong, not so friendly or communicative - more like talking to a wall. These little things can ruin an experience. Aside from that I do recommend coming here, make sure you have plenty of cash though - expensive
2
Funny place strategically located at one end of the Marina Shoppes. They serve funky food inspired by superheroes, and is quite good. But 30 minutes wait for a simple shake is to much! Okay it gives enough time to visit the DC Comics shop with very (VERY!) expensive goodies. But when you have more people behind the counter than patrons waiting I expect it to be faster.Next time I will order to Flash ;-

Come on, we've all been guilty of this before - theme restaurant, looks fun, childish enthusiasm bubbles up and you go for it when you should be running in the other direction... The staff here are terrible, even by Singapore standards - service is extremely slow and scattered, apart from when you want to pay - menu is a disaster, desperately trying to shoe horn everything into the theme but providing really poor quality across the board - it's tragic really rather than heroic - still a restaurant, still need to provide good service and good food - only upside is that the kids were glued to the TV and didn't really notice...

This place tried a little too hard, I did like the comic book menu, shame it had stuff in it that the cafe did not. Every item they tried to make a super hero theme, to the degree my batman branded quesida left me with black inky like substance all over my hands, clean up was not easy.The food was tasty enough, a little on the pricey end for what it was

Drawn in by the DC Comics theme by 13 year old son. Service poor (food came in plate by plate rather than together, same with drinks and one never came), aircon no good if near entrance in the booths, food the worst American style food I've had in a long time. Overall, skip it and go somewhere else.

We made a reservation for 530 pm dinner on Saturday . Glad that we sat under "superman" model. The food is served well with artistic deco of batman and complement with the lovely designed cutleries. Suicide Squawk which is roast spring chicken is not so tasty , Batman"s dark night burger is not bad - beef and burger taste good. Chicken Hawk (Quesadilla) is best, very cheesy. Though prices are above average , it is worth a visit .especially if you are DC heroes fan. Would recommend a celebration treat to the fans of superheroes . Services of staff are good even though they are super busy they tried their best to serve with a smile.

Didnt have food but had a nice coffee here. Themed crockery & Batman biscuits. Really good place to take kids if they're into all things DC Heroes with lifesize Batman statues, vehicles etc and memorabilia for sale

A little caveat: We only tried their cakes after a scrumptious dinner in another restaurant and after tasting the cakes, boy am I glad that we didn't try anything else on the menu. That Super Heroes café is a dream nook for comics fans is pretty obvious with all the cool stuff they have on display. Sadly, the food is not quite up to par with the impressive collection of memorabilia and merchandise for sale. We ordered speculoos cheesecake and lemon cake and both were dry and hardly spectacular to the taste. It's a pity because the price range of their food, desserts and drinks seem to be on the 'high' side for a café. We get it though, it's mostly the branding that consumers are paying for, but whipping up better food for curious customers wouldn't be such a bad idea either.:) But like I said, we only tried the desserts. Maybe next time we'll come for their meals and hopefully, we won't leave our table feeling let-down

Exceeds our expectations. We were accommodated by the staff Rica and was really welcoming. She offered a more private dining area the veranda where in we were able to do a little baby shower for our friend. Over all it was a memorable dining experience here. Will definitely come back. This is also a great small party place for kids and kids at heart. Food I can say was good although pricey a bit. Water is expensive and better be prepared to pay for $10 for a drink.

The inner child in me was extremely excited when I dragged my wife to have lunch at this place.As I saw the cafe from the distance, the delight and awe were oozing out of me. By the time we reached the cafe itself, I had a smile from ear to ear while my eyes wondered around with glee at how "awesome" the place looked!But by the time we asked for a table, it just fell apart from there. Good service did not exist (much the same as any low-to-mid ranges dining places in Singapore) which was a shame granted it was a tourist attraction.The quality of the food did not match the prices they were charging. The batman burger meal which was > $25, you would have hoped they served it with bats or some exotic meat because McDonald's big mac burgers was much better and cheaper. The drinks were equally as expensive (> $13) and they were nothing to brag about as they were merely iced water with flavoured syrups which you can get at the local hawker centres for $2!The staff needs to smile more and embrace what the theme they represented. They all looked miserable and was simply "in it for the job". Taking your kids here should be an awesome experience and the "daylight robbery" prices wouldn't matter as much if only they compensated it with service and enthusiasm of what DC Comics was about.Was it a memorable experience? Of course! Because I'll remember next time not to come back. There is a good chance their customers are not repeat customers either, not a bad business model for now granted the number of tourists that get suckered into "new" things is high in SG

Was really disappointed with the food in this place. Went in with zero expectations, and came out with less (so, negative I guess?). We had the Gumbo Soup, and it arrived as a watery, thin, tomato flavoured mixture. The serving is also laughably small. Their ribeye steak tasted good, but the meat was not that tender. This time the portion seemed equal to the price, but still, better steak can be had for less at other establishments. They don't serve water, but you can buy mineral water -- to the tune of 5.90 per bottle. It's a plastic bottle of water, but with a DC Comics label, so, you paid for the label? I don't get it. This visit did not make me curious for the rest of what they have to offer.

This place is a fun place to eat and enjoy all the comics and design of the restaurant. If you like super hero's & action movies then you'll love it here. Great place to buy souvenirs. The Food was great and the entire staff was friendly and helpful.

"Up, up and away!!!" I was holding on to my drink all the time, till I finished the drink, cos this will fly out of my hands when I let it go! Loved the presentation of a peanut butter milkshake in this Superman cup, complete with a cape! They have got different cup designs for the different milk shakes.And… No, the cup is not for takeaway after finishing your drink

The cafe is awesome. There was superheroe figurines displayed and the decoration is nice. Food was very very good. Service was excellent. But it is too pricey but it was worth it going to the cafe.

We all started off excited about lunch and unfortunately it went from bad to comical. The menu was interesting and we thought had a good selection. The Caesar salad was out along with the Wonder Woman burger. We then paid over $20 for lettuce with fruit in it, with a sprinkling of noodles, that really tasted like cardboard. My quesadillas was nice however, the fries were cardboard as well. In summary, paid $200 for five fries, 7 cokes, spaghetti, a fruit salad, 2 quesadilla's and a peanut butter drink. We could have gone to the Hard Rock Cafe for $250 and had dinner. Overall a terrible experience....

I went there to get the black Batman burger, which was delicious. The atmosphere is really nice, the menu is designed like a comic book, the walls are all painted with superheroes. They have lots of merch to buy.It was a fun experience. We went back the next day..

Went there today and loved the look and concept of the bar being a huge DC fan myself.As soon as we sat down for dinner it went from bad to probably one of the worst experiences at a restaurant I've encountered. Similar experience to customers below.I ordered the Dark Knight Burger and fiancee ordered Chicken strips but then I was gobsmacked with what happened next.Tried to order 3 different drinks all out of stock yet family who ordered next to us received a drink i wanted. No wonder woman exotica. No whipped cream to make a Hahaha then thought oh well will order a coke or soft drink. Yep you guessed it no soft drinks left at all. For $5.90 and being a Monday you think soft drinks would be plentiful.Service was terrible took 15 mins for girl to come to us so we cancelled order and left. Wonder if DC would be impressed by this

Wow what a cafe, something unique i've never seen anything like before. Very big and some cool life size figurines around inc batman and the joker.

Went with my family, my son is a big fan of Super Hero.Food are okay and service are average. Okay experience

We came here as two families with children thinking it would be a fun experience. How wrong we were. The young waiting staff, to be fair, were enthusiastic and helpful. The manager and the chef were quite possibly two of the most miserable people I have ever seen. We ordered a hot dog for a child, plain. The manager delivered said hot dog to the table with rocket and sauce on top, to which we said we wanted plain. She tried to argue that it was plain, so much for trying to please the customer. Anyway, eventually she took it, only to return with another with rocket on top. Luckily lettuce can be picked off, which we did. Tried to order water for the kids (only other drinks on offer were energy drinks or Coke), no mineral water left. Asked for two water, no tap water. Obviously they have no taps here either. Food was mediocre, and that is generous. Actually, for the price, it was awful. $40 for a stringy, fatty steak, for example. Also, asked for a steak with no veggies, sauce (for another fussy kid) and got vegetables. Chef clearly has a mind of his own.Sitting watching others have their meal, with numerous meals being sent back, clearly an indication of how bad this place is. We will never come here again and will be making sure that other friends and colleagues avoid like the plague.

Food was lovely, not super fancy but typical of a burger bar. Service was good. I loved all the decor and the fun menus, they really added an extra touch. Definitely recommend if you are a Super Hero fan. I would go back!

We were shopping in the mall for a while and got very tired. So we decided to find a place to sit down and chill. As we were finding places, we foudn this super hero cafe and decided to check it out. Full of awesomeness inside this store, full of DC comics character, many 1:1 sized to take pictures with. The ice cream I wanted was Batman paper wrap cone with chocolate and a sugar candy batman logo on top but it was all sold! I assumed superman ones were all sold too so they gave me a green lantern. Don't I sound like a kid already. The drinks and icecream were nothing special but it wasn't bad at all. Worth going to have some fun if you are a fan of superheros.

Finger foods are good but poor service and long waiting time for beverages. They took 40 mins for prepared cappuccino & 30 mins for latte. Service is very poor. The waiter only served us until we placed order. No one prepare the plates , cutlery and tissue for us. When they served us the finger foods, I think they expect we eat it with our fingers. Everyone was busy and end up we use hand and took out our own tissues.I only managed to get a plate and tissue after 30 mins later when a waiter serving a latte to my friend and I requested for the plates and tissues. We spent SGD76+ for 2 finger foods + 4 beverages. For this kind of price I will expected it’s a higher grade restaurant with better service. A bit disappointed and it’s quite expensive too

A must go for all the super hero fans!It's a very nice theme cafe and I want to try out all their foodgiven how lovely they are presented. I was stuffed when I went there so I didn't order much,just fries and a hot drink. I was planning to order the BATMAN iced chocolate drinkbut was given a heads up by the staff that it's very sweet.I couldn't help but wonder if the staff can just adjust it to the right amount if they find it too sweet. ??-_-The cafe food is a bit overpriced but compared to other dining outlets in theMarina Bay Sands, it is actually acceptable.I will definitely come back if I visit Singapore again

If your a super hero fan then go here. Its not cheap and the food is ok. Its all about experiencing eating at the GCPD or a super hero booth
3
Not cheap..nothing special....truffles fries are good though. ..Drinks and cakes are expensive....Unless you are superhero crazy...no need to goIt's also quite far from the main shops in the mall...If you got kids...maybe.

Teenagers loved it - adults not so much - food over priced - took forever to get served. As it is fairly new they will hopefully improved their service

Lovely Coffee, Wonder Woman Mocha and Red velvet cake.Cool coffee art and all in DC Comics themed cups and plates!!Must do for any super hero fans!

Visited because of the theme, the food and service is really bad.1. Our food does not look like what's shown on Menu. Therefore check with server just to make sure it's the correct order. But he's not sure (seems like a part-timer), so he asked a more senior staff over. With an unhappy face, came over to our table standing there waiting for us to ask (without a word). So we asked is this the correct order as it looks different from Menu. Then she bring over the Menu to match, without knowing the food and she just replied yes it's correct.2. No one came over to refill the ice water and server is not attentive (maybe we are allocated to a corner where no one will walk over to check it out)3. After food we requested for the Menu to order dessert. The server took our order and came back in 5 mins telling us they don't serve us dessert, we'll have to go to the counter to order and ask them to charge to our table. Question: Why do we have to go over to order the food ourselves and pay the 10% service charge? Anyway, my friend went over to order, then they told her to pay first! So my friend came back to take her wallet to pay. Then they say they don't serve to the table! WHY??????4. When they serve the coffee, they did not serve with sugar! And you will have to call for the server again, but we're not able to find him. So ends up drinking our coffee without sugar instead.5. This restaurant is operated by celebrity chef yet the foods and services ar sucks. I think food court services are better than them!Overall, unless you are going there for the theme else no point to visit this cafe as the food are not tasty at all. With that price, I'm sure you are able to have much better food somewhere else

Great cafe - diner on the top floor of the shopping centre, if you are a Batman fan this place is heaven
5
love the food presentation something different. but tastes ordinary to me. its just the experience and the ambience that i love since im a fan of DC super heroes! would definitely visit and try again
3
I tried this restaurant because it looks cool. The Superman, Batman and other characters are all over the place. I ordered the food and it wasn't special, just okay
2
Went for their signature "Dark Knight" meal, which was very tasty but also quite overpriced. The staff seemed clueless and we had to actually ask to get served
3
Had high expectations prior to the visit but was utterly disappointed with the food served. Orders and reviews as follow:- Batman's Dark Knight Burger: presentation was nice but that's just it, the patty was average, the buns were ordinary- Some linguine dish which was so not impressive that I could not even remember the name- Catwoman's Caramel Latte & Choc duo: decent tasteOverall rating for the food - OVERRATEDThe setting was nice though, but unless you are a DC superhero fan, else don't bother
1
Thinking this was going to deliver the simpler coffee experience we ordered our iced coffees and I had a cookie. Waiting over half an hour for a coffee in a cafe is just unacceptable. Despite the levels of staffing seeming generous the wait seemed eternal and the cookie didn't taste nice either. I am not sure any hero is going to save this place
2
A shame the service is so slow and confusing. You get food before drinks!?!Only go for the gimmick, not to enjoy a meal since you will be stressed out by the staff before eating.
