Place had a nice vibe. We got the roasted chicken which sounded normal but we were pretty blown away by how tasty it was. Skin was really crispy and taste was great

This is my second visit to this place. This time, I brought my colleagues along and we ordered the set lunch. All of them cannot stop praising how yummy every dish was. we will definitely visit again. Well done, team 20 Cavan!

Surprisingly this place is really cool. Love the deco. The menu is rather slim but the quality of the food is good.

Brought my dad here for his birthday. Parents really enjoyed themselves and the chef came out to speak with us too! Good ambience, interesting dishes. I particularly liked the blueberry lamb dish.

Location is a little difficult to find, but very nice and spacious inside. Good food and coffee too.

Visited here twice within weeks tells you it's worth the find. The ambience is modern simplicity with tall ceiling and spread out tables. Not many noticed that the china and cutlery used are upmarket pieces, tastefully matched with the cuisine. The hype here is a careful mix of Chinese main with western sides....like roasted chicken served with walnuts, cashews, almonds topped with spinach and rockets. We ordered the lamb which was coated with blueberries sauce, without losing its original flavor. All the food in the menu are hardly confined to the orthodox taste buds yet the creation stretches your palate to a new horizon. Service crew was meticulous, often offering help before you asked for it. I thought they deserve a higher price than what they offer. You won't regret!

We wouldn't have expected to find such a restaurant in an old lane of light machinery businesses and oldschool shophouses.The only restaurant that actually have a wait staff who came up to greet us and pass us a menu while we were standing outside looking at the decor, it was actually the third we passed by that night. And we were glad we did.We ordered adequately, and hated the fact that we didn't have more mouths with us to savour on the rest on the menu.I hated to see blood in my steak, and I must say this is one of the best well-done steak I have ever tasted in Singapore.Finished almost everything in my plate for once. Unbelievably delicious.The starters were done beautifully. Not only something that look nice, every single of the 3 items was very tasty.Seafood items were very fresh too.What woo-ed us over was the sauce for each dish. Complimented the mains so well, we almost bottoms up even after we were done with the food. :D exaggerating, but not very far apart.The down side of the place is - the outdoor seating can be very humid. Limited seating outside for those who enjoy some fresh air too.Outdoor seating tables were flimsy as well. We look forward to revisit and will probably be sitting inside the next time. :

Service staff were friendly and had a smile on their face. A nice change from the stony faces in most places. Food was great! Had the canton roast chicken and the chicken was tender with a nice crispy skin. The other half had fish and chips and it was good too. Fries were made from real potatoes. Only thing is it could be slightly more crispy. Yam and pumkin pudding was yummy. Only grouse is that they should allow all the main dishes to be used by the entertainer app. After all, the cheaper one is the free one. If not, implement a better policy by ensuring that one dish is not the "premium" one.

Really quiet restaurant with really pretty interior design and ambience! Food was interesting but can be quite pricey! May not be that value for money. Service was really good as well.

Visited as a party of four. Place was quite empty that evening. Food was outstanding, and service was efficient and personal.

The fusion food is excellent and so tasty. The platter of spicy mushroom skewers, soft shell crab w pork floss is super delicious. Really love the lamb with blueberry sauce. Heavenly. Recommended

Great service!
The idea of fushion of eastern and western ingredients was great. We had a good meal and will be back to try other dishes.

New restaurant in an otherwise unassuming street. Friendly staff, fresh look, swift service and the food (tried the blueberry lamb and lemon pudding) had good, daring flavours and was reasonably priced too. Chef came to check if I was I happy and had any feedback. They served some nice Japanese craft beers. Hope they can keep up the good work

It's cozy and the cafe is thoughtfully decorated with the colorful floor paints and bricked walls. Staff were friendly as they kept checking on us proactively. Had the beef udon and prawn and scallops and both dishes are highly recommended. It's definitely pleasing to the tastebuds. Super value for money with 1-1 chope
