If you like seafood and particularly crab, this is the place to eat! As per my title, the service could be slow during the rush hours, but it's worth the wait.

Bad experience for me. 1h15 to wait for Black pepper Crabs. I had to catch a flight with my friends so we wanted to leave but they forced us to pay the full price!! Not nice at all because we had no time to eat the crabs!!! Service is slow and they are not kind at all!To Avoid
