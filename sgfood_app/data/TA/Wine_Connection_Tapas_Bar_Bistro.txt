First time to Wine Connection Tapas Bar & Bistro. Great service, special mention to Ravee for his excellent service mindset!

Best place in Singapore for the ambience, wine and good for the money they charge. My favourite spot for any evening out.

You grnerally cannot go wromg here if you need to hang out with friends. Sometimes can be a little busy...
The food is good..and great ambience too..

We came here for a drink after dinner. The place was not crowded and very relaxing and pleasant. The service was a little slow as we waited for some time for our drinks.The pricing was very reasonable as we had four drinks and the total bill came up to SGD 50

In the bustling Robertson walk, it’s hard to make a choice on f&b venue to dine in. But we went into wine connection with not so much hope and were pleasantly surprised.Food - Chorizo pizza for starter, Paella for 2 as mains and a chocolate lava cake for desert.Pizza was thin without much of topping but was still flavourful. The chorizo lard definitely did the trick here.Paella was flavourful, 4 big chicken pieces, generous portion. We fully enjoyed that.Lava cake was ok, nothing to rave about.Beer options were good so were of course wines. We left the venue with stomach full and contented. Will definitely return again

Thai owned chain, but very European in feel. Populay with ex-pats.Rumour has it they bring the meals in pre-cooked and then re-heat them before serving. This ensures consistent quality and presentation but dont expect mind blowing home cooked flavours (think very superior airline food).If the food is a bit uninspired they make up for it with the booze. You just cant fault the value for money (for Singapore) wine list. In fact they sell for dining-in at not much more than supermarket prices, and their take-away prices are very good indeed.Always busy. Service is "I'm here to do a job", and they're happy to argue with you when they get the order wrong.They have branches all over Singapore and this is probably my least favourite of the chain but it does the job if youve a bunch of friends who want to catch up over a few bottles of wine. They deserve to succeed for their pricing policy, other Singapore mid-rage restaurants with their $100 bottles of plonk should see how busy Wine Connection gets and learn from it

You have two sides to enter the 'restaurant' - one side is the 'drop-off' point and the other is the roadway at the back.We sat outside 'Curbside' and had very good service ..... until the POS went down. Staff handled it okay with updates regarding our food delays, a few mix-ups/mistakes but all-in-all, things were good.In terms of food (once we got there), it was stereo-typical Wine Connection food - good, wholesome, fairly priced .... just what you would expect.Nothing to shout about either way - but not robbed, the prices were fair
5
I went with a colleague and was totally surprised and pleased we found this place tucked away in a corner along the quay. Great wine selection (obviously) and good menu choice. Friendly and attentive staff helped make this a very relaxing and enjoyable meal, would recommend this place for sure, good for business, family and friends
1
Decided to go to dinner as I heard the food was good. However during my dinner, I saw the kitchen staff taking out their exhaust and washing it with a sponge with soap over the stove top at around 8.30 during the middle of service while still making food. It is so disgusting and unsanitary. As a person in the industry, I know the exhaust can be very dirty and to clean it during service and still cooking, it is a horrible sight to see. I’m not the only table in the restaurant but many and this should not happen ever. The food is good and the service is good but to see this kind of thing happen, it really is unacceptable.

We’ve been hear 4 times in the last two months & I have to say the first time was outstanding & the last three have been good. They changed the tapas menu & I personally don’t think it’s as good as what it was. I also think the timing of meal delivery could be tweaked as we received the meals at all different times (not Tapas but the meals). Overall, it has a beautiful ambiance, excellent wine, great service & good food & will definitely be back again.
4
Lovely place to go to for a drink and some tapas. Wines are reasonably priced and they have a large variety . Tapas are nice - I particularly liked the spicy gambas. They have a nice cheese board as well. Lively ambience .
5
We dropped in for lunch yesterday to wait out an afternoon rain storm. Friendly staff, good menu choices and fast service. Reasonably priced for the location.
4
Good and quick service. The food was nice the wines were good. It was busy but we had a lovely evening.
4
We sat at the bar with a bottle of wine. Perfect for a chilled post dinner drink and a lovely atmosphere. I don't usually drink white wine but the Italian bottle we had was very nice.
4
Returned to WIne Connection at Robertson Quay for another visit this week. Tapas prices seem to have gone up since my last visit but are still reasonable: 9 tapas for $59++. The German beer here remains decent, priced at around $10++. Overall you can still eat and drink here at a very fair price. Early in the week it's east to get a table and the service is friendly and efficient
2
We arrived and saw it was a very popular place. Luckily, they were able to seat us. However, the two-tops are very close together and a couple of times I thought I was going to get hit in the head by a server. Most of the servers looked unhappy to be there and a couple of the ladies were rather rude. When we ordered tapas, as it is in the title, we were very excited and expected excellence. We got the 9 for $59, which seemed like a great deal; however, we got ALL of them at the same time. We were shocked that they would provide all 9 tapas at once and to our small table for 2. A couple of the items were cold (i.e. the ribs and meatballs) and we sent them back. The meatballs are not what we would call a meatball as the size was equivalent to the tip of my pinky finger which is beyond small. The rest of the food was okay, but not worth the price nor having 'Tapas' in the title. Would not go back
4
A lively restaurant with lots of local trendies. A wide choice of wines. The food was really enjoyable. As it was a busy night trying to get the waiters attention was not easy but everything arrived together
3
We were recommended we go here by a local and we had previously had drinks at the wine connection at Orchard road which was nice. The drinks and food here were nice but 2 meals of 4 came out 10 -15 minutes before the other 2, this gap was too great food should be served at the same time, Disappointing
2
We were there for dinner.. not a busy weekday night but yet trying to get the waiters’ attention was a challenge. Meal for the family was mediocre. When time came to settle the bill, I took the initiative to approach the counter (again getting the waiters was an issue) and was directed to pay inside. Once inside, was told by one of the waiters to wait outside and walked away.. it wasn’t until I explained to another staff there before he proceeded to process the bill... not a good experience for a restaurant of this status..... very disappointing service
3
Have been here a few times before but left disappointed this timeMenu choices are great and the food is good. Large areas inside and out with modern designThe issue was the slow and poor servic
5
I visited here with my girlfriend and Mr. Yiswa gave us a wonderful service.
We had a fabulous time thanks to him.
Will surely come back to have his great service.
4
If you are coming in a group, please order the to-share seafood paella. Simply fantastic! But avoid the pizza, it is average and you can barely taste the ingredients. Service was ok and friendly.
5
This place is really buzzing but still manages to maintain good food and good service. A lot of people but doesn't really feel crowded and it is a great place to catch up with friends and hear them talk. Recommended .
5
Very pleasant dining experience with great food, plenty of choice , great attentive service. Will go again
4
Stopped here for lunch after having wandered orchard st. Was a nice spot. Good deals on food at lunch time, 15SGD for a main and a soft drink etc.
3
Although there is a large choice of tapas, only 3 are available for vegetarians (vegans would only be the olives). Rather good value for money, unfortunately we got an agressive attitude from one waiter as we got the check and asked to divide the amounts.
4
Not sure if it was an off night, but the entire area was dead on a Saturday at 7pm. The food was delicious and drinks were tasty. However the service was the most memorable part of the experience. Our server was not very friendly. All business and it didn't seem like he was happy at all. Maybe it was an off day or something happened, but I didn't find him very conversational. Having said that, the food was great. Pasta was cooked perfectly and the wine was also on point.
5
Visited here for a lunch on Saturday.The BBQ Pork Rib was so good.I enjoyed it.I took a glass of Chile wine, and it went along.The atmosphere was very nice as neighbours come by themselves or with family.Peaceful Saturday noon.Probably it has different ambience as the restaurant has big space.I hope I can come back to enjoy a dinner.Such a nice place
3
I was initially put off by the faux-bodega interior, laminated menus with pictures (although I guess that works well when your customer base is multi-lingual/-cultural), etc., and our starters didn't impress either (stale bread, unremarkable charcuterie), but the main course was quite good and the wine even better, all delivered by reasonably helpful and efficient service staff.However, my main complaint, and the reason for the three (rather than four) stars was the incredibly noisy environment, so much so that I really struggled to hear myself, let alone my fellow diners. This is partly because the place seems to attract groups especially, some of whom can get quite rowdy (and this was on a weekday evening). But it's made worse by the loud music, loud air con, etc., all of which forces everyone to talk loudly to stand any chance of being heard. The whole thing escalates into a cacophony which made my ears ring for the rest of the night.All in all, not my kind of place. But probably good for groups in a party mood - everyone will find something on the menu, all the various tapas and 'sharing platters' etc. will suit group dining, the 'buzz' will help get the party started, and having a noisy group seated at the next table will help rather than hinder your own enjoyment
5
We were having drinks on a Friday night at Kanpai, which was an abysmal experience. After trying to order more drinks only to be informed that last orders were over, and waiting 45 minutes for a tonkatsu, we decided to check Wine Connection out. After we got a table, we immediately regretted going to Kanpai in the first place. The environment was much more comfortable, and the crowd was way more cultured than the people at Kanpai.Being a wine distributor, their wine menu was extensive and has everything for everyone. The prices are also incredibly affordable and reasonable for Singapore. Service was friendly and unpretentious. Not having to wait thirty minutes on average per order was also a huge perk. We didn’t order any food so can’t speak for the quality of their dishesAfter a night of drinks at Wine Connection, I’m a new fan and definitely will return if we’re going drinking at Robertson Quay
4
We visited this place based on other trip advisor reviews, we weren't disappointed, reasonable priced wine, nice food, tasty, freshly and well presented, the staff were helpful, tidy casual attire is just fine, would visit again.
5
We visited the wine connection Tapas Bar twice whilst we were in Singapore and on both occasions the service, wine and food were exceptional.
4
Lovely service and friendly service, I had the sea bass which was very nice the waitress was open and honest but she kept wanting me to drink more booze.
Good value for money will return
4
We visited this place with friends for drinks, and it was a very decent experience. Would like to visit again. They have a wide variety of choices for drinks and tapas and cheese options to go with it.
5
Great service, friendly staff, had the Chicken Parmigiana and my wife the chicken cesear salad, very nice mea
4
Visited here on a Saturday night with friends. Had a selection of tapas to nibble on as starters then selected main courses. Nice selection of food and very tasty. Very busy restaurant but the service was still good. Really nice red Rioja red wine to accompany the meal but wished it had been room temperature. Would visit again
5
My husband and I read reviews about this bar before we set off on our holiday and we were not disappointed. We enjoyed a tapas dinner with wine which was very good. Efficient service that was above the call of duty
4
A great location if you are after nice food, good wines and service all at reasonable prices. We didn't have to wait long for our meals and there was plenty of very helpful staff to cater for our needs. We went for the lamb shanks - but missed out on the special (a bottle of the wine of the month with paella), so before you decide on the menu - check out the specials.Recommended
4
A very good welcome and fast & efficient service. We really enjoyed our dinner time.Only minor regret, I called 5 times during the day to book a table. No one has picked up the phone. Once we were at the restaurant, things were much better.We will definitely come back for a new experience.Thank yo
1
Am writing a review while I am here. The manager herself is a passive person.. when we raised the concern that the Waiters having taken orders have forgotten to place the order. It's a pathetic experience and an evening spoilt. The manager and her staff surely need a lesson in running a restaurant. This is after the restaurant wasn't even half full. Poor service
5
i meet up with my friends here every once in a while. Wine by the bottle is sooo reasonably priced....the paella rice and finger food was good too! i tried a few dishes and it is all so tasty and yummy!
5
Went here close to the end of our visit. The pizzas were fantastic and well priced. Went back a second night and had steak, very tasty and, again, well priced. Do yourself a favour!
5
Love the food, location and the crew! jasinder & Martin have been awesome. Have the wine! Amazing selection as always.
5
Thanks to two of these guys jass and milton very pleasing guys. I like the service and the atmosphere of the resturant.
1
We had been eyeing off this place for a few days looking forward to our visit. Whilst our friends enjoyed their choice, 2 of us ordered the duck and mushroom salad only to get 3 very thin and small slivers of both on a ridiculous bed if lettuce. Cheese platter was ok but it was overall disappointing
2
Here I am looking my favorite dish the "chicken parmigiana" just to get frustrated even before getting the dish to the table. First things first: two people, we already said we'll not be sharing and my friend ordered salad as a starter. We get question if everything should come together or salad first. The answer was salad first and so we got salad first. Two minutes later my friend's main dish shows up and he just started his salad. Now I'm thinking, why is it so difficult for a kitchen to understand that eating out is a social event!? If it's for one to eat and the other to watch and then get my food by the time my companion is done with his food .... I'll just eat at home. Learn how to time the dishes, please. It's F&B basics. This is not a fast food joint. So now comes my parmigiana. And it came to the table without a drop of tomato sauce. That's something new for me. I asked for some tomato sauce and was offered ketchup. Seriously????!!!!So now my dish went in only to come out again with a manager with an attitude telling me this is the way it is and if I want sauce I have to pay for it. Well, I don't want to pay for sauce. All I need it was three spoons of tomato sauce and I would walk away a happy client even with the fiasco of bad timing serving the dishes. Well, you lost a client.
2
we arrived for a nice meal. we were surprised by the indifferent servers.The pasta was made poorly with an unfresh taste of low quality ingredients. The steak was a disappointment as well. Not real restaurant quality but tasted like you would expect at a tourist trap. shame
1
Ordered the Roastbeef Salat from the menu which is even a Chef's recommendation. Instead of roastbeef ... they bring braised beef slices which is of course a totally different taste and doesn't go well at all with the salat. After telling the service staff ... no word of excuse or an espresso on the house, nothing. That makes it even worse than getting a wrong gone dish. Been a very regular customer but might need to give that location a miss for a while.
4
Came here for dinner last night with my parents. Very busy on a Saturday night, but if you arrive by 7pm there's no problem getting a table. The same good value tapas choices as on previous visits, and well priced beer and wine. Never a disappointment here
4
This place is always very lively with loads of people inside as well as outside. The tapas is very nice and the wines are great, many by the glass for you to different types. The staff is very service minded and nice. Try the risotto balls - very very good ;-) As well as the Australian shiraz, sit outside and enjoy wonderful Singapore.
5
Jasinder was amazing, remembered my order few more mths ago. Fun and constant attention to detail. Thumbs up!
5
Thank you so much for Jasinder for the absoute attention and great recommendation of wines that made our visit such a pleasant one
5
I was here for first time with group of friends and there was two supervisor give us a perfect service. Made us feel special. Good work by jasinder and rule. Keep the good work guys.
Thanks for the night.
5
Fantastic atmosphere combined with excellent service
Fair prices did wine and amazing tapas
The most accommodating supervisor:Milton and Jasinder
5
Visited here with a couple of my mates after many years. Gotta say, Alexa is such a stunning beauty...lots of charisma, excellent service and a great presence...Made our nights with her lit smile and graciousness. Definitely coming back for her again...Cheers!
5
We enjoyed our Saturday night with food and wine here. We got attractive service, especial from Milton. He was friendly and pay a good attention on us.. Taste of wine was very nice from his recommendation. Perfect weekend! Will come to enjoy again!!
5
Good food and customer service on point. cheers to martin and mildon for the excellent service. shall come back again for more wines!! (:
5
We had a fantastic dinner here. When we arrived,we had awesome service especially from Milton. The food was excellent and delivered exactly when we asked for. The wine was also surprisingly superb. Definitely we will visit again
4
During my business travel, I visited here after work. Even some wine were not available, we fully enjoyed relaxing with white wine and dinner plate. Pasta and salads were very nice and not too heavy. The plaza area in front of this bistro has no car so you can enjoy there without noisy. Note that dinner place locate inside and just tapas bar is in front of Robertson Walk entrance (taxi drop point).
4
Good food (pizzas are excellent, carbonara were not great). Good value for the money and OK service.
4
Always be the place i will spend my saturday night with good wine and perfect atmosphere. Good food and service.
5
Great meal, great atmosphere- we had Jerriek serving us and he was so attentive and friendly we think he deserves a promotion. Thanks wine con, another successful night xxx
2
Loud, obnoxious, poor service, wines by the glass were very low quality for the price. "Tapas" were basically bar food
3
Used to come here a lot but Recent experience wasn't that great. They have sized down on the portions. But the beer is very good and good price.
5
Wine Connection was an accidental find but my husband and I were glad that we did. There was an abundant selection of good wines and great selection of cheeses. We didn't try the food but the table beside us ordered a pizza, which looked and smelled absolutely delicious. I would definitely recommend this place for a drink before dinner or stay for dinner after a drink
5
We have been visiting the restaurant for many years as we stayed nearby. It is a wonderful place to hangout with friends usually after our workout or over the weekend. Our frequent visits is not only for the good food and great wines but more importantly is the excellent service by Jerrick. He's very attentive and know his wine well too. We always take his recommendations and it has never failed us. We could see his passion in his job and his sincerity when serving the guests. That's has made us kept going back as we felt we'll be well taken care of. Keep up the good work, Jerrick.
4
Good overall I must say. The service always efficient... so perfect is was nice to observe. Food was also good. We had assorted platter, BBQ pork skewer, borratta and tenderloin. They all were tasty. The location is good and the prices are reasonable for singapore.Cool lively place... but not something special or unique
5
I went to Wine Connection after looking on Trip Adviser for somewhere with vegan options in Singapore. When I got there they told me there are no vegan options on the menu however they could make me a pizza without cheese with any vegetables I wanted. The pizza was so delicious. The service went above and beyond to make sure I was happy with my meal, I would highly recommend
5
This is my first ever review on the internet. Because the experience was just too good to be ignore.Jerrick was my server for the night and it turn from one of the worst to the greatest i have experienced.It was raining.I was with my dog(couldn't sit indoor)Lack of knowledge for Italian food.Minimum experience for good red wine.But all this was not a problem for our trusty jerrick.I highly recommend you to head down to wine connection and request to be sit where jerrick is working! Cheer
3
Really love the atmosphere of this place - just a nice vibe. I got the Greek Salad and Hubby got the Chorizo Pasta (which was much spicier than we thought, but still good). Cheese plate was really good (six different kinds of cheese, although one was pretty bland "airplane cheese"). We got the special the server was offering on the wine...$4.90 for a glass of one of three different wines. The wine wasn't great, but it was cheap, so that was nice. The chocolate martini was very strong (both on coffee flavor and on alcohol)...not sure if I liked it or not. Overall, this place isn't spectacular, but the prices are very reasonable for Singapore and it's got a good atmosphere. Would come here again with friends
4
An ideal location to make a stop by for good wines and cheese. If you prefer otherwise there are many options around the area.
5
Jerriek giving us very good services. He have good knowledge for wine connection product and always recommend us the best wine.
4
Nothing else than enjoying the Wine and Cheese Platter, while having a chat with some friends here, it just simply relaxing.
5
Met an excellent staff, by the name of Jerriek. Don't know what to drink? Get Jerriek. Don't know what to order? Get Jerriek . Overall, absolute and wonderful service from Jerriek. Totally enjoyed my time here and I believe my companions agreed fully.
5
Super awesome service from Milton! Constantly keeping an eye out for us and checking if we're doing okay. Thank you for the awesome service again Milton!
2
The wines are still good and reasonably priced, but the quality of food and service has deteriorated while prices have risen. Always new staff without experience
5
I come with my family and friends I like the food,I like so much the carbonara and lime pie I want to come again!!Thanks for good services and friendly Thanks also Milton !!
4
The service and ambiance was fantastic and the staff very attentive and helpful. The only reason I gave it 4 star was the lack of restaurant wifi, which as we are visiting Singapore isn't too helpful planning the next days activities. Food was good, the children had Pizza and adults the Pasta. Will probably go again
2
The staff and the ambiance is still nice but the foods was really awful...Just a good point for the cheese dish but the tomato-mozarella was frozen and had no taste. In the same, the burger was very very bad... I can try best at Burger king...Even the wine had no taste.I'm very desappointed about this restaurant
5
I always love to be here , great wine comfortable price and very friendly staffs Milton and all.Great place for Wine lover, very nice food and good price. The location is perfec
5
Great selection of wine, good prices and impressive service. Love the atmosphere here. We will be back!!!
5
This place has good wine and food at really reasonable price. They were having a promotion going for a sausage platter and Riesling at $59, it was a really a steal, both wine and sausages are really good.
5
Milton, the best service staff. We have a great night under his supervision. We will definitely come back for Milton again!!!
5
Great atmosphere and gets very busy. Quick and friendly service at a reasonable price for Singapore. Some of the best pasta I have ever had.
5
Just had a great time at Gardens by the Bay and fancied a really nice meal. Went to a couple of resturants but not booking in advance is a problem in Singapore.. Not at WC. Got a really nice table straight away. Pizza was great and we shared a really nice cheese platter and some yummy wine. Staff were very attentive and friendly. An other great night and superb value for money in this expensive city. Really recommend this place
4
We have to agree with previous comments that the staff are very friendly and helpful. We would like to single one person out for praise, but all the staff were equally helpful. Wine selection is excellent at very economical prices considering the setting and the ambience. The food was brought to the table very fast, perhaps too quickly for some who wish to have a leisurely evening out. It was surprising that with the technological stays of Singapore that this venue offers no Wi-Fi connectivity at all. Overal, I would definitely recommend this restaurant to others, and will return myself.
3
Look, it's busy and bustling, I suppose, but it's not a mecca of fine wines - unless, of course your benchmark is a low-level NZ sav blanc. The prices reflect the quality but I was prepared to pay for, and experience, much better.
5
I have frequented Wine Connection since it started out as a corner shop of Robertson Walk back in the days when the infamous Double O disco was just next to it. I have witnessed it grow from the corner shop offering free plate of cut french loafs with every purchase bottle of their 'rock bottom, net priced' wines to their current expanded wine universe.It was here that I first tasted the 2004 Fat B*stard Chardonnay that has a floral and vanilla finish and was my first exposure to Argentinian Wine.As their business flourish, so did their outlets. Wine Connection Cheese Bar, additional Wine Connection outlets at Orchard and now Wine Connection Bistro.My first visit to Wine Connection Bistro was not the most pleasant in terms of food experience but service was amazing. We ordered the pizza, which the service staff said was hand stretched. When it came, the crust was clearly ready made and probably frozen versions due to the thickness and uniform spot prints on the side of the crust. We put up a feedback to the service staff and the manager on duty then, who promptly apologized and she offered us some free bar bites. The Caesar salad, Mushroom soup and Spicy Crab pastas tasted amazing and were nicely paired with our Argentinian red wine. When we settled our bill, we were surprised that the pizza wasn't charged to us. The manager said it was their fault and they will rectify this. Their kitchen is still stocking up their ingredients and staffs. Hope that we could give them more time to get ready so that when we return again, hand stretched pizzas will be a reality. A big plus for customer service!We did return a month later. Lo and behold! The pizza was really hand stretched! Complete with irregular stretch shapes, the tomato base was tangy and compliments the rocket and pharma ham toppings. We had ordered an Argentinian Sweet Wine for the night (We were in the mood for sweet wines that day) and it was able to to bring out the tangy tomato base flavors and its cherry undertone. We ordered Sausage Fettuccine and Mozzarella and Spinach Ravioli as mains was equally satisfying. Overall, the food experience was great. The service was prompt and staff was easy to get their attention though it was a Sunday dinner time. Have recommended many friends to go there for value for money drinks and food. Wine Connection also expanded their alcohol offering to imported rare (in Singapore) German, Belgian & Italian craft beers on the tap, reasonably priced at $9.90 per serving (500 ml or 330 ml). Do go check it out soon!P.S. Apologies for not stating the wine variety, vineyard and actual food name in the review. Somehow the TripAdvisor system said the words were profanities, even though it wasn't, and didn't allow me to post. *shrugs
2
Wow how to rate this restaurant- a real challenge between staff trying to do the right thing and Mgt failings.Let's start with the negatives-more than half the beers on tap not available - a key marketing point- Key glasses of wines not available- hamburger only done medium rather than medium rare as requested ( how hard is that as I am sure the steaks are offered all ways)- Hamburger when it arrived very juicy - too much- Salt shakers emptyThe little things make a differenceHere how the staff responded - I was offered a $5 glass of excellent wine not advertised which was great as opposed to the $11 wine I wanted- the burger was very very tasty despite the cheese not being melted fully and the burger ended up being med-rare figure that one out?- staff were friendly and attentiveMy take out is management complacent and taking customers for granted ( obviously very popular) and staff trying to do the right thingGive it a try and hope you get the right wait staff - management should be shotHah
2
I have to agree with goneftn, that the pizzas are ordinary. Just spent 11 nights in Singapore and visited may restaurants/hawkers for lunch and dinner, all were great meals. We decided to have a night in so I ordered takeaway Hawaiian and before leaving I thought I better check. When I opened the box I was shocked at the amount of toppings, some slices had nothing other than sauce and cheese while other slices had very few piece of ham or pineapple i asked for a refund but they insisted that they could not refund me the money and would make another pizza so i waited another 15 minutes for another and the second pizza was no better. The assistant manager claimed it was very good quality, i didn't agree. I insisted on a refund and went else were. So if the manager is claiming that they have improved the quality of pizzas it certainly didn't happen while i was their last week
5
I have been here two times and enjoy it more and more.They offer great wine at decent prices and nice food with variety of options.
4
Visited Wine Connection during the week for dinner and found a very nice atmosphere, cozy terrace, nice people, interesting international wines on the list and good to go menu to eat. Service in fact is quite good.
5
I have been here for years for their exceptional value for money wine. I must admit i am not a professional wine drinker (can't tell between the good and the very good) but for the price offered, i have no complaints at all. Their food are quite decent as well, and their selection has increased quite a fair bit. HOWEVER the biggest surprise is their BEERs! I think its $9.90/pint and they have very special beers from Belgium/Germany which you cant find anywhere else in Spore, and all straight from the tap! My fave is their Blanche De Bruxelles! If you need a beer, yes, you actually can go to WINE connection
2
Amazing really, so many people, so busy.Service was great, no complaints here.The people beside me sent their meal back, don't know why, didn't ask.I wanted pizza, had read the reviews and it was all good.I asked which one to order and I was told Carnivore was the go so I ordered it.I got half way through it and thought "why am I eating this crap?" It was soggy and horrible. I am not a big pizza eater but my kids in Aussie eat Dominos and dare I say it but they taste better. I should have gone to my normal pizza place in Singapore where you finish and think "I wish there was more!"No idea what the rest of the food was like but the pizza is very ordinary.Drinks are great prices
5
This place never fails for a group of fiends to get together over a wide selection of reasonably priced wine! Shout out to:Hani who's a great hostess who never fails to great us with her great smile! Another staff to highlight would be Jerriek who's always attentive to our needs and recommends good win
5
One of my top dinning place in Singapore.Great food,ambiance and good value for money.The wine is amazing and the staff friendly
5
It's always a pleasure to meet people with a passion for their work. Jerriek at Wine Connection Tapas Bar made such great recommendations of wine and food and that made our weekend evening extra lovely! Thank you Jerriek
5
Visiting our son in Singapore and the first night when we arrived he took us to Wine Connection... so much so after a visiting a few other restaurants over the past few days we decided to have dinner tonight again as we had found other places didn't provide the customer service.... Jerrick and Stella were outstanding tonight-very impressed with the service, food and selection of wines...... love the tshirts.... I can.... you guys definitely can. Thank you!!
4
If you are looking for a reasonably priced place for a fine selection of food and wine then this is the place for you. it is very popular and the service is friendly. These is a great selection of Tapas. A great place to hang out with friends for a lazy afternoon drinks

There are many restaurants in the Clarke Quay area, but this has to be one of the best, very popular, friendly service and a fine selection of food and wine at reasonable prices (for Singapore) The tapas selection is very tasty
4
We had a late lunch here. The tomato and mozzarella salad, garlic gambas were delicious. Had a couple glasses of wine. Nice service and well priced.
No wifi
5
Really cool atmosphere, great location. Great food and wine. I would definitely eat here again! I recommend it.
5
Popped to Wine Connection with my daughter and her hubby. What a really nice place. Great as always to eat outdoors in Singapore. Food was really good and quick to arrive. Beer and wine was excellent value. Staff were really friendly and all in all a great night
5
Great location and atmosphere. Perfect restaurant for evening drinks and dinner! Very good selection of wines and excellent service. We visited the place on a Sunday evening and it was very busy but the service was quick and friendly
5
After browsing the choice of restaurants at Robertson Quay, we were attracted by the contemporary decor of this restaurant, together with the lunch deal promotion on offer.The two Course Meal was outstanding as was the Beer and Wine selection on offer at reasonable prices, the service was exceptional, we were very impressed and would not hesitate in recommending. Would love to sample the Tapas Selection that looked great on the Menu
3
Good selection of wine, not a large choice of tapas and most of it had the same spices... the venue is very nice and cosy, service staff is average to good. Price wise, expensive... but apparently cheap for Singapor
5
Found this gem by accident while walking around looking for just this type of place!Great atmosphere, snacks, light and delicious.Beer menu could be better perhaps but wine was great! Quite a busy little place but we found the service excellent, friendly and efficient! In fact we ended up going there a few times, a nice little walk from our hotel
4
This is a great place to enjoy a drink and some great snacks after work.We visited on a Thursday evening and the place was very busy but the service was very quick and attentive and the food / drinks made for a great evening.A great location and perfect for evening drink
3
This has been my common after work drinks spot for the past couple of years. The main draw here is that the wines are cheaper than other bars/ restaurants, and it has a nice atmosphere. Food here is not bad, especially its risotto balls. They can be a little short staffed, and their staff can be a little rude at times
5
Here's a new favorite place at Robertson. Prices are surprisingly nice for such good food and service. Environment is amazing and getting a table outside is even better. But if you happen to be indoors, enjoy the beautiful people that visits this cozy restaurant. Difficult to order from a menu where you want to try everything. I'll be back for sur
5
Spend an evening at Robertson Quay close to the river and enjoy Tapas, full meal or Pizza. There is a good selection of wine at reasonable prices for Singapore.
5
Great food! Amazing service by our friend Jerrick! Very nice and remembers us every time! Very kind person!!
5
I went here with two of my best friends for a nice more relaxed evening. We greatly enjoyed the atmosphere, tapas, wine, and service at Wine Connection. Overall a great experience and would highly recommend.
4
Good food and good staff. Maybe the music was too loud that complicates the conversation with friends...
5
The location is perfect.The staff are friendly and actually remember you have a name!They are attentive.The menu is varied, good and food tastes super!and at the end, when your emotions are raw and fresh, they are not afraid to ask how you really feel - putting a mini iPad in your hand and asking for feedback.this is customer experience in the best way. And as a result, I will go back - thats what it is all about isn't it
5
There are two Wine Connection restaurants at Robertson Walk mall, the Cheese Bar and the Tapas Bar and Bistro. We went to the latter and ordered a charcuterie platter which was average, but the surf and turf option for two was the winner of the night. You can select 3 items and we went with the salmon, pork ribs and beef sirloin. The ribs and salmon were excellent, but the beef had a few chewy bits which was the only downside to the dish.They have a good range of wines, and priced much cheaper than many other wines I had during my stay but they were still of great quality. Their service is also good and we got our dinner served surprisingly quickly. I would definitely return next time I'm in Singapore
4
We booked a table ahead of time on e mail. The interior was quite nice so we decided to stay indoors. We had the cold cuts platter for 2 for starters which was quite nice, with bread. We shared the Surf & Turf platter. You can choose 3 items and we found the salmon to be really tasty. The beef (medium rare) was a bit chewy. Altogether a very enjoyable evening for us.
5
Great value! Simple yet good food, good variety of wines and the best service in Singapore! Especially the supervisor Jerrick which is extremely attentive, kind and personal, every time we go there we feel like guests at his home! Definitely recommend :
4
My friends and I had a great time here. Foods are good with enough serving. Wines are very affordable. Service is great! It was packed that night bec of Valentine's celebration but all the staffs were very attentive and prompt. Kuddos to the team
5
This restaurant was so good that we ate here twice during a 3 day stopover in Singapore. At dinner I had one of the best steaks I have ever eaten. At lunch I had a delicious salad. The staff are very friendly and the atmosphere is superb. I'll call in again if I'm ever in Singapore.
5
Ambience , food and wine is amazing. There's nothing more to ask for in life than this combination of pleasure , especially with the sweet service of Jerriek .
Keep up the good work, will always come back for you and the establishment !
3
I know this chain for a long time,I think they start in Thailand,for a glass of wine and a cheese plate is the best spot,also some of the dish in menu are good
4
People are very smyling and food was good. Lot of noise but mood os very good. I should come back. Still don't understand why we pay extra 1.87$ for sauce with 110$ total amount 
4
Great to find this place in Singapore 'where everything is so expensive' this was a welcoming find. Food was excellent pub grub with a good selection from lite Bites to full evening meals. After eating lots of Asian foods elsewhere it was great to go back to some English basic food ( which was extremely good ) Service was quick and friendly- between the 3 of us we had lamb shank which my son said was the best he'd had / pizza that was light and fresh / sausage and mash which actually had proper sausages !! Wine selection was excellent Only negative was no internet connection and air con wasn't that cool. But food and service and value for money was excellent.
4
The location is convenient, just by Roberston Quay, although when sitting outside it can be unpleasant if taxis/cars pull up & leave their engines running as it too close to the exhaust fumes.The staff are friendly & helpful.The wine selection is pretty good by Singaporean standards.We had a simple platter selection of cheeses & meats & it was very good
5
Love the place for its selection of food and drinks. The custom service is awesome. Jerrieck was a good with profound knowledge of the menu. Attentive and observant. Will visit here more often with friends. -Vanith
4
You should not expect a place with a stunning view, but it's busy and fun to view the crowd at Robertson Quay. Wine and cheese choices are close to perfect and the prices compared to other places are reasonable. Surprising is the "no sharing tables" policy, even when most of the tables only been occupied by two persons. Luckily two ladies agreed to join, so we enjoyed mixed cheese platter and several of wines by glass.
5
Down for our usual drinks at wine connection but wow we were impressed by Jerriek with his knowledge and passion for wine. He spent a great deal of time explaining the different types of wine to us and recommended some really good ones. Look for him if u are dropping by! :
5
I've eaten here now three times. None of those are spectacular, but over all this is very cozy and safe choice is you are looking for some wine and bite. Wine list is impressive and bottles are quite affordable compared to most places in Singapore. Food is standard good and great value as well
3
We had dinner at this restaurant twice. Once we had pizza - not bad. The second time I had spaghetti carbonara and my husband had salmon ravioli. The salmon ravioli was bland and came out with nothing else on the plate. My carbonara was only average. Good service and reasonable prices but didn't really enjoy the food.John & Gail Lane
5
Though it was a bit too crowded for a week day, food and ambience made up for that. Cheese platter is something you should definitely try.
4
Called for late lunch on a Saturday. European food with a good range of options (light bites or full meals). I had pizza and it was delicious. Very reasonable priced. Excellent service.
5
We came here to enjoy the wine and took the cheese plate as well. It was enjoyable and the prices were fair, too. Will definitely come here again.
4
With excellent service. The prices were so untypical for Singapore....great value (not saying cheap). A limited range of beers... Which fine for a wine place. The cheese and cured meat plates along with a nice bottle of Cava was the perfect to catch up with a dear friend. Service was attentive without being pushy.
5
We come every week, the best place in Singapore and the best service ever! the great food and great wine. Jerriek is the best!!!!
3
I was looking forward to the paella i had in a year ago, but it was not available anymore. The paella for this round is so-so. The staffs were not very attentive and would crowded at the counter instead of paying attention to the customers. Was trying to ask for refill of water and bill, and needed to wait quite long. 1st time experience was much more friendlier and better
4
Excellent menu which matches very well to a solid wine list. Everything is well priced for Singapore. Food comes out reasonably quickly and nothing we ordered missed the mark. I like this place and will be returning. Bookings taken before 1900 hours and walk in after that
1
Last week I attended the wine connection and had I fine evening, yesterday was very different. My colleagues had found a place to sit. When I joined there was 1 seat to few. After our order was taken we asked for a seat. The attendant went for it. But then the manager shows up and says he cannot serve us because it is a 2 person table. He wanted us in the corridor. We said we preferred to be at the street and if there was no seat I would stand. He then took a hostile attitude saying we needed to respect him. We were very startled about it and decided to leave. I have never been treated so rude as a costumer and can't imagine this man is a good manager
5
We turned up without a booking, and were given a nice table overlooking the square. We were instantly astonished when we saw what a great price the bottles of wine were, and loved how they were ordered. We ordered a couple of plates of tapas as well which were nice, even though some were a bit disproportionate in size.All in all a great place to spend an evening
4
If you are on a tight budget and still want something decent, the Wine Connection is always the best place to be. They have a few more popular branches in Singapore: HillV 2 , Cuppage Area and the Robertson Quay. The wines are affordable from $30 onwards. There are also expensive selection if you are going for a more pricey one. The tapas at the Robertson joint are affordable and simply delicious. The staff at the restaurant are always helpful and cheerful. They will not hesitate to attend to your needs. There are also craft and bottled beer for order. The only down part is that the toilet is a little far and have to walk quite a bit , it gets challenging especially if you are tipsy
4
Came back here for another visit with a few friends last week. Good selection of tapas and reasonably priced wine. Efficient service. Popular as always. I'm sure I'll be back.
5
Good recommendation of wine from Jerriek Tan. We enjoy the food at good price
Bistro
Highly recommend to those wish to have hang out time with buddies or entertain customers who close to you
5
Great place to hang out with good range of wine and great food menu. Friendly atmosphere created by all the servers.
5
Good service for this supervisor Jude.
It's good service from this restaurant he serve me well
It is very hard to find this kind of service in Singapore
Thanks you Jude
Keep up the good job

PROS: Decently priced, efficient service, good food/drinksCONS: Too loud? I don’t get out much. And when I do, the depths of my pockets are unlike the many millionaires here in Singapore. It’s enough for the occasional steak and drinks. So I spend it wisely. Most nights I end up here.The place is huge. Even with that space it gets packed on weekends so call in to make reservations. If not, you may have to wait outside but not to worry, all reservations are up to 7pm so unless some idiots want to sit with their half glass of Malbec until 9pm, it’s best you grab a sandwich somewhere first. Or you can always wait at the bar and have a few glasses until you realize that drinks on an empty stomach are bad news but why did they have to make that Pinot taste so good?I remembered an evening where I couldn’t decide on a wine so I asked if I could have a look at their inventory which, in hindsight, was totally stupid because if you can’t make up your mind from the list, a look at the bottle makes little difference. So they offered to give me a taste of my shortlists. Not only did I save a buck by choosing wisely, I now know that I can probably sneak in a few glasses before I start on my own bottle. Have a good time “tasting” just don’t drop my name when you’re asking for that third glass “just to be sure”.Then again, it’s not like they didn’t try to make things easy for novices. In fact, they even made the sensible (and Singaporean) decision to categorize the wine list to fit your budget. So if you’re feeling like an Arab sheik and planning to splurge on the best, pick from that section and booze away. Just note that Arab sheiks are most probably Muslim so they won’t be drinking anyway. Not the best analogy but I know you and me, we get each other. *fist bump*Recently, my friends and I had our New Year’s Eve dinner here. There were 7 of us. Considering we had about 5 entrees, a salad, a pizza and a few starters plus a bottle of red and some beers, the bill came to about SGD$31 per person. You can barely scrape through a decent cut of meat at most joints at that price. If you happen to come across the hostess at the front (not the young, smiley one, but the shapely, dirty blond with sassy eyes) you would realize that she is very much like the restaurant – no-nonsense, neither warm but nor cold, and a what-you-see-is-what-you-get kinda vibe. This outlet (they have others too btw) is like a well-oiled machine. The waiters are constantly moving yet helpful. If you flag someone but they can’t take your order (some do bussing some do everything) another will float over in no time. And when it’s been a long week and all you need is a nice pasta and some Chardonnay, these guys deliver. In double quick time and with a smile. If you’re looking for a romantic place for two, there are a couple of nice places overlooking the river. If you’re thinking of a quiet dinner, you’d be sonically surprised. Come with friends or family because you should add on to the ruckus every weekend. And you will get to appreciate a restaurant that is consistent, efficient, cooks delicious food and which will not rob you blind. A rare find these days. TIPS: - If you have smokers in the group, best to choose the tables outside (near the road) so they can stand at the side for a puff. It doesn’t get too loud outside too.- The restrooms are shared among tenants in the building and you need a pin-code to enter. Press 0001 for the ladies. I donno the code for the men cos I didn’t go. Scream for help if the same code doesn’t work

Thanks to Jerrick, Ravi and Celina for their fantastic service! I booked a table for this great spot on email and received a very pleasant and prompt reply. On the evening, we were very well taken care of. Absolutely will visit again. Cheers! Laur

Food could not be better. Brilliant prices and great portions. Risotto balls are beautiful. Service is shocking. Called in on a Sunday afternoon. Was extremely quiet. Far more staff than customers, but to try and get their attention was torture. Very bad English also which resulted in wrong food coming out. Will return, but for the food, not the service.!
4
We already visit a couple of times. But its really a great place to be especially with friends. Nice ambiance restaurant quality and price are in balance. Very friendly waiters we will come back agai
4
Again there with friendsThe whole Square has so much to offer Wine connection is the bright stargood wine decent foodFantastic Ambienc
5
Brilliant service by the team. Jude was outstanding in terms of service. Jeffrey was brilliant as well. I would recommend everyone to come and try the good food with the excellent service...
5
Excellent and good value wine, with a very good list, as well as delicious food and a great atmosphere
5
Great food and great service. Jude has been extremely helpful in recommending the wine. Overall experience has been good- good ambience, food, wine and staff. Duha as a trainee has been helpful.
4
Thank you once again to our servers, Jerrick, Jude, Andy and Terence for the excellent service during our company's christmas dinner last night. Requests were attended to promptly, food, wines and champagne were of pretty good standard as well. The only downside was their choice of furniture for alfresco dining. The tall chairs were too tall and tables were too low, which made dining a little uncomfortable. Apart from that, the atmosphere and service is definitely a thumbs up. Would definitely be back again in the future
5
Our family 2 adults and 4 kids had dinner here on our last night at Fraser Place Robertson Walk and was a highlight of our stay. Food was delicious, service was great and surprisingly it was extremely well priced.We only wished we had found this place before, we will be back on our next trip
4
I am a Wine connection regular patron since the first time i was introduced back in 2013, i have been to Wine connection from Robertson Quay, Hill View, Cuppage in Singapore to 2 outlets in Bangkok. But the one that always draws me back is the Tapas bar in Robertson quay. I have made a few company gathering there and everyone of my colleague left the place with a big smile. I can see they really enjoyed the food and the wine they offered not forgetting the services. But In order for all this to happen, i will have to thank your waiter Jerrick and the gang, sadly some of them had left. Every visit i made, Jerrick and the gang never failed to impress me by giving me the top notch and most attentive services. His knowledge in wine never failed me, every bottle he introduced me, I did really enjoyed it. I really hope Wine connection can keep such standard in all the outlets in the future. Good Job to Jerrick and his team
5
This is our Favourite local joint whether for our date night or Sunday dinner with the kids. Food is good and cheap (a rarity in a restaurant in Singapore ). The staff is excellent - Jerriek and the guys behind the bar are always so attentive and friendly to
5
Thanks again to Jerriek for making our date night at wine connection special. We sat outside and Jerriek and the team looked after us. Great food and fantastic service. Keep up the good work
1
Big let down. Had dinner at their Katong outlet and 1st picture was taken from menu which I ordered and lo and behold, the meal came totally different from what was expected (2nd picture)Checked with staff and apparently told that they ran out and chef decided to replaced simply with wedges without even asking me if I am fine with that and look at that piece of pathetic tuna?!?!From then on, everything just went sour and there were six of us and food were served individually at 15 mins interval. The four of us had finished our food and the last two of my overseas guest were still waiting for theirs,which were eventually served after 30mins.General rule is to ensure the same table is serve together with short interval but not to the extreme of we experienced. Truly a very awkward moment for me and my family and guest. No fault of the service staff but I doubt the credibility of the bistro management and quality of their 'cooks' and false marketing (see menu visual and what was served)...appalling!!I guess they should just stick with selling wine and leave it at that.
4
After watching a play at the Spore Repertory Theatre, we decided to have drinks at this Wine Connection. The prices are so reasonable and the waiter that served us was most polite and amicable...I'm sorry I didn't get his name. He's the epitome of what a waiter should be...he not only recognised my friend who went there before but remembered what he ordered! Kudos to him!! I would also like to commend him for his discreet approach to the re-order of drinks by not being overly intrusive!
4
I would say the food menu is average but the beer and wine selection is quite extensive. However, if you are sitting inside the restaurant, the aircon will need to be improved as it feels quite stuffy when the crowd start packing in. It is also slightly confusing since it has another similar joint few feet away focusing on Cheese Bar
4
I was there with a friend for the 1st time. We had wine at the bar, received good service from PREM. Keep up the good job!
5
I and my colleague had a wonderful night with this bar. with the variety of drink and professional service we had totally be amazed. My thank to Jerriek for his service and his amazing marketing skill. Look forward to see you in future
5
I would like to commend Jerriek and Evan for their outstanding service. We were amused by their wine product knowledge and the small talks with us really makes us feel like home. We love theirs service!! Thank you for your hard work!!
5
Great food, wonderful ambience n excellent service. Thanks Zack for your good work n we will definately visit this place again.
5
Logi the bartender really cater me. Allowing me to try the wine so I can decide. Allowing me having my me time and still made the effort had conversation
5
Great spot to stop for well priced wine with an excellent selection. Staff were fantastic and food was delicious and affordable. We've tried both the Tapas Bar and the Cheese Bar and would highly recommend both.
3
Loved this outlet in the Hillview area. It is important to choose an outlet according to your preference. Some are places to see and be seen. Some are perfect spots to chill on a lazy rainy afternoon. I enjoyed a good value NZ Pinot noir which was easy to drink without food. Ambience is quiet and service unobtrusive.
3
Came with some friends... ordered sirloin steak and a bottle of wine... while the service is great and environment is okay.. the food standard is below average... come if u are looking for good place to drink some wine at reasonable price... if u are looking for great food.... it may disappoint u..
4
My first visit and this was good so I came back a few nights later. I went with a group of local expats who often have a wine and dine evening there. A very busy and noisy place and bustling with people. The food options are pretty standard but well done. The wine selection and prices, for Singapore, are really good.Overall a nice and enjoyable place and will be back
4
Wine Connection (Tapas Bar) is one of the best wine and food place. A must place to dine and wine. The family of staffs will make you feel pampered and cared for.If you don't get a table just ask for the bar seats where the three wonderful bar brothers Guna, Logi and Saffian will certainly see to your needs and provide you with great recommendation of wine selections and pairings
4
We ate here prior to leaving Singapore, with a late lunch. Good selection of tapas, beers and wines. Service was good (very few others in the restaurant). Food was delicious and set us up for the rest of the day.
4
This is a good place for a light snack or a full dinner . The tapas is very fresh and delicious. Best to book though as especially on a Friday or Saturday night it does get very busy .
5
Had a lovely lunch here! Food was great and the prices were very reasonable. Fun friendly service in a great spot
4
Had lunch here on a weekday. Their lunch sets are great value. Add a glass of bubbly if you're in the mood for it! Service can get a bit slow when they're swamped at lunch time
4
The environment is too good for a date with your partner or friends outing. I enjoyed my night over there with a glass of cocktail and seafood penne while my guy had fish&chips with a glass of beer. It was a memorable day at Wine Connection
4
Great food, great drinks, superb staff and ambience!Their range of tapas, pizza and mains are shockingly affordable and yet delicious! Staff are always at hand to attend to you. Always packed out on weekends so expect to wait for a table
4
Wine connection has helped bring affordable food and decent wines to Singapore. I often go to both the venue at Robertson quay, Cuppage and I12 Katong. The good is generally the same quality and I always go for sparkling Shiraz which is perfect for Singapore weather. The apple crumb is also a great way to finish a meal here. Worth while paying a visit and take away wines are at a good price (for Singapore
5
Really busy trendy restaurant, good food, atmosphere and service. We had two meals and a takeaway pizza here during our weeks stay and enjoyed them all. Good tapas and very nice paella
4
We were staying a short walk from Wine Connection Tapas Bar and went in there for dinner one night because it was close to our hotel and we wanted to avoid a spectacular electrical storm. We weren't disappointed with our meal and in fact went back the next night as well.The restaurant serves a great variety of tapas and regular dishes, is casual and the food arrives as it is prepared. There is a wide selection of wines by the glass as well as by the bottle and without the often eye-watering prices so common for wine in Singapore. It was a fun place to dine with good service and tasty, well-priced food
4
Found this on our last night in Singapore. Great buzz. Good service. Well priced food and drink (for Singapore). Warning! We ordered our tenderloin steaks medium. They arrived practically raw. Apparently, this is how the locals like their steaks. Supervisor offered free desserts to make up for our disappointment. Companions who didn't order steaks thoroughly enjoyed their meals. Great place to eat as long as you ask for your steaks to be served 'incinerated'
4
It's a comfortable place to sit with good selection of wine. It's a comfortable place to sit. One cheese plate with glass of wine in afternoon is really relaxing.
4
Snacked with friends. Wine and cheese - very pleasant ... note that if you enrol on Theo website you can get a free glass of wine.
5
Alex is the best waitress who recommend good food with good wine accessories. This resturan can strongly be recommended
5
We were stopping over in Singapore for 3 nights en route to Brisbane and found this bistro not far from our hotel on our first night. The tapas was superb as was the wine and the staff very attentive - we enjoyed a lovely evening. We returned on our last night having had a dreadful meal elsewhere the evening before and again were not disappointed. Thoroughly recommended
4
They offer a lot of wine choices. A LOT. And the best thing is they are not your regular high end wines which sets your wallet ablaze. Instead, their most expensive wine on the menu hovers around S$100.00ish and while mostly decent, you should manage your expectation if you are particular about your wines. Food is mainly tapas. And you should so order from this menu. Its not superby generous but it serves to leave enough room to try an assortment of selection. Service is good. Plenty of staff and mostly polite. Great for big gatherings on a budget.
2
We had onion soup, a bread basket and a glass of wine. The soup was luke warm and did not taste very good. The white wine was not chilled. Too bad, I think.Look for more reviews by MulleEllum
5
Cosy hangout located in west part of Singapore, friendly staff and great wine pairing recommendation. Nice retail area for you to pick up wine, available both dine in and to-go. Ideal for both family and friends gathering
4
This is a great place whether you are going out for dinner or just for drinks and tasty tapas. Choosing the tapas set as a starter is a good choiche. The fresh creamy pasta with ham is also a great option. I would really recommend to order a bottle if having wine since the glass did not meet expectations even though a more expensive one were chosen. Be prepared for a noisy, vivid atmosphere in a traditional winery location
5
I have been in the Wine Connection Tapas Bar & Bistro for the 3rd night in the row! Besides the great bites, a wide range of good wines & beers, I particularly like the location. Sitting outside among relaxed people from Singapore and all around the world, I dearly enjoyed being served by Alex, who seemed to have the service outside under very good control. Not only did this guy take very good care of our orders, but he is also great fun to talk to! So even turning up there alone on my 2. visit was just as entertaining as going out in a group.Love that place
5
Always have such a great time here. The service, food and wine always tickles our fancy.Our host Alex really looked after us and introduced us to promotions which gave free drinks which made it even more enjoyable.Highly recommend. 5 stars
5
Came with friends for the first time. Had an amazing host called Alex. Wine recommendation was phenomenal. Amazing service will definitely be back!
5
I've eaten here on a number of occasions and can say that the value and quality here is second to none. Particularly if you know the prices for wine out here...
I recommend the platters and one of the great wines on offer.
5
Ate here a couple of times, very busy and lively but enjoyable. Service excellent, staff always checking if you needed more drinks. Food very good and fairly reasonably priced for Singapore
5
This is not about the food but the people who work here, in particular Alex and Jeeriek. They could not have been more helpful and they finished off, by taking care of an expensive pair of spectacles my party left on the table, keeping them safe and returning them the following day when I picked them up, with a big smile; thank you guys
5
Recommended by locals we decided to give it a try on our latest visit. Fantastic. Steaks and pasta were fabulous and the wine selection tremendous. The best meal we had in our four day break by a mile. Service great too and staff attentive throughout
5
We dropped by at 1:30am on the Saturday night and were turned away by the Wine connection tapas bar who told us, "wine only no cheese". The wine connection bottle shop next door was able to make us a great cheese plate, salad and fois gras terrine. The selection wines and the prices is fantastic for singapore. The food was served very quickly and was presented beautifully. The staff made us feel very welcome despite us staying quite a bit past the closing time of 2am. Thankyo
4
Great selection on the menu, staff a little slow at times but otherwise okay. Food was good and came out fairly quick
5
My friends and I celebrated my birthday last 3rd October 2016 and it was a total blast! Not only the food was great but Wine Connection gave us a beautiful outside table that can let us feel private but at the same time attended carefully by the great staff Jude. He knows how to suggest and upsell in a way that we will just say "Sure!" Or "Why not?!" We are social drinkers and loves proper service since me and my friends belongs to the same industry. Most of them are too particular but that was the first night that there's no complaints with the service and food (really!). I highly recommend this restaurant to friends and couples who wants to wine and dine at the same time! Please don't forget to tip your great server. Jude and Wine Connection, thanks for making my birthday memorable! All the best and we'll be coming back soon
5
I popped into Wine Connection with a friend after work for a bottle of wine and some dinner. The place was very busy for a Wednesday night but the team took good care of us and Alex made sure our drinks arrived quickly. We will be back soon.
5
The food was delicious. The wines were exquisite. But what astounded me the most was the prompt service we received from our server, Jude. Although the place was busy that time, Jude never failed to attend to our needs. He displayed the right amount of knowledge for us to order what pairs well with the wine we chose. At the same time, we felt how he genuinely liked to help us with our errands, as we were preparing a surprise for my friend. This kind of service is very rare in Singapore. Wine Connection is lucky to have staffs that can deliver =
4
Singapore can be quite a pricey place to eat, (bar Hawkers Establishments) and this place is pretty reasonable.
Nice Atmosphere, Very Good Tapas, will definitely revisit.
5
Evan was the perfect host, recommending wine which we really liked. Was here for a light bite and a drink. Easy going and great way to spend Sunday evening!
5
Good food, good wine, good atmosphere, good service - go there for a good time :)
Prices are good too
5

Met Alex here and he was like the best guy I could have meet!! Tom was serving us for the evening and he was friendly and provided great service! Def in hotel recommend this place and won't be long before am here again!
5
This is the place to be!!! I have been to the tapas bar several times and every time is wow!!!Tonight is all the more special as Alex and his team made all of us had the night of our lives!Thanks Alex!!! We would like to see you again!Cheers
5
Best spot for anyone looking for a good scene, good drinks, and great food/tapas, at a good price! Their beer prices are always happy hour prices (with quality pints of beer). Our server, Alex, was awesome, as all the servers are. All child friendly too. Great area to explore other pubs, food, and river afterwards too!
5
This is a place that serves good quality wines at affordable price. Not expensive, but reasonable. The warm low-light ambience makes it a conducive setting for dinner. I was here with my colleagues to celebrate a farewell. We ate mostly cheese and accompanied with a glass of wine for 8 people. The service of the crew was pleasant and not crowded given the location is away from the clubs and bars in clarke quay. Seems like a good place to catch up with friends too
4
1st time to have dinner here, the meal is good, but waiting for a long time, will try again once come to Singarpore
5
This is one place to head down to for affordable wines. The crew are friendly and they never fail to recommend the best stuff in their menu. Its a lovely place to hang out and chill with friends or family. I have been her for many years and they have never let me down. Good food and great wine. They sing birthday songs too.
5
This place has the ambience. We came during a bz period but still got seats. Kudos to Alex and his team!
5
Always have great time at wine connection with delicious food and great wine. Personally prefer Wine connection@I12 Katong's food and also less crowded.
5
Very good wine and service. We really enjoy to say here.
Thank you . thank you for refillining wines promptly.
とても素敵な笑顔でたくさん素敵なサービスをしてくれました！
とってもいい店！ありがとアルヨ！
5
Had a pizza, absolutely awesome. Thin and crispy base as it should be. 2 beers for under 10 bucks. Gotta be good value..
5
Food is very nice, service is excellent! Ambience is good, restaurant is always busy. Highly recommend it to all my friends. If you want a good deal and very friendly service look for Alex amongst the staff.

We went here for dinner on a weeknight. We arrived at 6:00 and soon after the place was full, so it is obviously very popular. The tapas were quite good. We also had pasta which was ok and pretty reasonable value. The pastas are quite simple though, which was expected for the price. The pizza was also quite good. The chicken salad was just ok - needed more dressing and was a little bland. Wine selection by the glass could be better, as there were only around 1-2 of each wine type available by the glass (and my first choice was already sold out).The service was very good. For a low-mid range priced restaurant (for the area) I would recommend.Good value
5
Cannot recommend this place enough if you are looking for great Italian food in Singapore. Their pizza is incredibly delicious and wafer thin. And for Singapore, everything is very reasonably priced. It is located in a very lively square which many other bars/restaurants around which gives it a nice atmosphere in the evenings, especially when they are showing football.All in all, we paid around 40 Singapore Dollars each which included pizza, wine and shared starters.Will definitely be coming back here next time I am in Singapore
5
I visited the outlet with hubby again, really love the wine promotion of the month, it's only $29 per bottle. Ordered the cheese platter and seafood pasta, both taste very good. Service was exceptional , we can even change our goat cheese to blue, waitress was extreamely patient and flexible, love the place.
5
A wonderful tapas like experience with wines by the glass that all works well together.We started with a nice Rose and when the food arrived, moved to a CÃ´te du Nuit . We had tuna with sesame and black squid ink pasta and sea bass with mashed potatoes and ratatouille,both were great and at better prices than I have seen in Singapore.This is a place on the move so your food comes out fast and service is brisk. If you want to have a two hour dinner, be prepared to sip your wine slowly. But a fun evening with much better wines and good food at prices that were good for the area
4
Went here for the Spanish and Portuguese wine-tasting session, and ordered a Cheese Platter and an assortment of tapas. The variety of taste complemented the sparkling, white, rose, red and dessert wines for tasting that evening. Furthermore, service was warm, albeit busy given the success of the event. The best part of it is the price performance of the food and drinks menu. Have recommended this to friends, and will return
5
Had a lovely lunch here, nice share platter & smoked salmon salad to start which was very tasty. The mains were lovely too, the wine was reasonably priced for Singapore and the service was 10/10...highly recommended 👍🍷
4
Menu is varied and good value, good quality. Choice of wines is also good and is in a great location.
4
Wine Connection is a great place with very good value and nice food and wine. If you are looking to enjoy some cheese and wine with good price, here is the place.
5
Would like to extend our thanks for the wonderful experience we had in Wine Connection. It was imense pleasure to enjoy the food delicacies and the friendly yet very proffesional service in a beautiful ambience.
5
Service was awesome. The crew found us a nice cozy table where we had a really nice time.
Thank you and we will defined come back.
5
I was particularly impressed with the service Anudeep provided. He was friendly and detailed oriented and I must say he made the evening a memorable one. Highly recommended if anyone is looking to have some good chill out night in Singapore
5
This was a great location for our company business gathering to announce the opening of our new Singapore office. The staff was excellent, in particular Alex and Jerry, and the food was delicious. I would highly recommend this location for business gatherings or just a meet up with a group of friends. This place is hoppin
4
Had one night in Singapore so decide to try wine connection tapas ... Food was a 3, wine a 4, and service a 5 resulting in the 4 rating. Liye did a great job !
4
Wine Connection is one of my favorite wine and dine places, but though I still go occasionally to the Robertson Walk joint, my preferred outlet is now the one at HillView2. Last week we popped into Robertson Walk again, and ordered some tapas starters. The tuna tartare bruschetta (see picture 1) came and was just 2 tiny pieces, each the size of a big thumb, and certainly did not look appetizing enough to justify its $8 tag. The manager was nice enough to take back the plate and cancel the order. We enquired and it seems we were not the only one who had ordered and returned the dish. Tapas, I think in Wine Connection, is just not worth it. Dont know why the chef persists in things customers dont appreciate. Case in point, there used to be a very popular and reasonably priced lamb cutlets at $20+. It was taken off the menu and then put back on months later but with about a 50% increase in price. We also dont order that anymore. With the very low inflation around us, hopefully the place does not abandon its value for money offerings.On the other hand, have a look at Italian Osteria (IO), which is located in the same HillView 2 building as Wine Connection's outlet there. Look at the mushroom bruschetta in pic 2. Each IO's piece is easily 5X that of WCon's. Sure, tuna is probably more expensive gm by gm compared to mushrooms, but you wont regret the IO's at just $9 per plate for 2 big slices. And its in a fine dining setting too, albeit very busy on certain days. IO's wine starts from $48 but it is pretty good and comparable to WCon's of similar price, although WCon has much more variety at lower prices. And service is equally good despite the crowds.Wine Con has more outlets, and hence greater volume, but it has to watch its value for money goodness. There is now IO and we love it more and more
5
Most Fridays and always once a week for ice cold Cava, Salmon platter and the best Pasta in River Valley. And don't think you have to pay a fortune for an incredible filet mignon. Right here and right every time. Try sitting at the bar on busy nights and ask for Guna and Logi. Fantastic bartenders that are fun and genuine. Very cool duo
5
Totally in love with this place! An awesome place for chill out session. Highly recommended for wine.. Would always be back for the fabulous service !
5
frequent with friends who just fancy wine very much!
Best place to chill out and have a great catch up!
Alex is just the best guy to look for if you need anything!
5
Our fav hangout place to chill after a stressful day at work. Awesome service from the staff! Would always be back for the affordable and good wine<3!
3
Having expanded its space and food menu since its inception, this outlet is one of the nicer and popular ones in the dependable chain for a meal or gatherings.
5
Very nice ambience and amazing tapas and wine. The staff is friendly and ever helpful. Seems like weve found our hangout joint. If you ever drop by ask for Alex. He'll hook you up.
5
I visit this place everytime I go to Singapore. Love the pairing of food and wine. Love the salads, foie gras, olives. If only the staff could smile more, be more friendly, and more willing to help out customers while ordering, then it would be perfect for me.
5
I have been to at least three different Wine Connection venues across Singapore, my favourite being the larger one at Robinson Quay. It has great wine with a decent selection and delicious tapas, cheese and cured meats. It's a comfortable place to sit and chill out with friends and unwind
4
Great food for dinner and affordable set lunches are also available that comes with appetizer or dessert with main course. Big space to cater any groups of people, wide range of wine to choose from, be it white, red, rose and so on, amazingly not expensive at all
5
Initially we didn't have any reservation.. we walked in and was manage to get sit for 8 immediately, I am very amaze by the service and the way how you guys manage such a big place .. we will definitely will come back.. and special thanks to Alex for making our evening memorable..
3
I went here with my friends to try it out since im new in singapore but in my surprise it was very busy as i expected during weekdays or perhaps i went there during happy hour. Nevertheless, the food is quite average and the staff seems too busy to attend to all the guest which is understandable. It took us 40 mins to wait for our food and it came out pretty average. I gave 3 because of the atmosphere and ambience of the place and a good drinks will consider a plus.
5
Very nice food. You'll get a range of Western food but it's delicious. Next to a couple of restaurants and bars so it's quite convenient. Obviously a good place for the wine drinkers.
5
Singapore is expensive once you move from the hawkers' markets, so this place is worth a visit if you want good western food on a budget. Even the wine isn't as expensive as most places. Steak, pork, fish, all tasty and tastefully presented.
5
Very enjoyable experience, starting from the fantastic service to the very appetising meal and complementing wine, as suggested by the waitress. Thoroughly enjoyed the restaurant atmosphere, and everything was very reasonably priced.
4
Great tapas. I appreciate that because I don't eat so much these days. Staff is pretty good. Prices reasonable. Great people watching as at ground level of residential buildings.
5
One of the best options in either Singapore or Thailand. Soon also in KL! Well priced - especially the wine for Singapore where wine is usually crazy expensive. Great service. Well trained staff. Unbelievably extensive wine and cheese selection! Loved it!

Wine Connection Robertson Quay has very good food and wine at affordable prices. The steaks are good value and so are the tapas and the bottles of wine. Good concept as well - buy a bottle of wine from their collection. The service however is very inconsistent - we have had really good service at times and we have had really really bad service at other times. The other thing that makes dining at Wine Connection Robertson Quay a bit frustrating is that the food never comes out together - at times half our table has almost finished their meal whilst the other half is still waiting. I have given feedback to the staff there at times but have been told not to expect food to come together as "this is not a fine dining restaurant". One other time we had to spend at least 20 minutes ordering as the waiter kept coming back and telling us that what we had ordered was not available. So do not go here if you are in a hurry, and do keep your service expectations low
2
I went there with a few ladies and the waiter tried to make me buy the most expensive bottle of wine instead of the one on promotion. He insisted in front of my ladies friends thinking I would feel obliged to do so. They also tried to being extra bottles we did not order at our table of 8 people hoping no one will notice. I really did not appreciate the behavior of the waiter who just wanted to get extra commission. If you just want to get cheap wine with disrespectful services go ahead. Otherwise I won't return ther
4
On our first day of arrival, our friend took us to try out lunch at this restaurant. Surprisingly the price is not too pricey and the food is delicious. Not only that, the service of the staff is excellent and with smile all the way. A good smile and service will make a tiring day goes away. Puts energy to restart your leisure stroll and sightseeing despite the hot weather in Singapore
5
Located in Robertson Quay with great indoor and outdoor seating. This place is perfect for any occasion or just casual drinks. Food and drink choice is excellent. Tapas is great for sharing with friends.The staff are really friendly. For Singapore the prices are excellent, I doubt you will find better value on the whole islan
4
There are some Wine Connection restaurants in Singapore - however they are close together - so be sure to get to the right one. I spend an evening at the Tapas Bar and Bistro. It was much larger than a I thought, but it was a real good place to hang out. Alex, our waiter, was such a great and nice guy, he made 75% of our experience, which was awsome. The choice of tapas is not super large but sufficient. The wine menu is really good and offer a lot of options for almost everybody. The music (outside) is very pleasant even when they started playing loud House music inside the restaurant around 10pm. The location of the restaurant is very central, i.e. it is in close proximity to some popular bars
4
A good place for food and drink. The service is fast and the staff are friendly. I love the steak and giant lobster. Would definitely come back here
4
Reasonably priced, decent fair and always busy..........worth a visit. Food is well presented and would suggest booking if you plan to eat here at a weekend.
5
Alex was awesome! Very friendly and profesional!
wine is great value for money, location perfect, food ok.
Perfect for drinks
5
Had fantastic meal at this place. Was lovely to have a reasonable and lovely bottle of wine which is fairly hard. So much so we returned for our last night. Excellent service. Thanks!
5
Fantastic and quick service. Friendly and effective staff. Comfortable atmosphere. Great tasting food at reasonable price level. We came back two nights in a row...!
3
Popped in as nowhere else serving food at 3.30 pm for late lunch. Helpful staff and quite a few veggie options. The pizza was thin and crispy and ok and the service efficient, prices reasonable did Singapore.
4
Had a meal here mixture of food all good. Very busy. Good Tapas bar with wine and cheese board bar next door.
4
Went there with a friend and more friends and the place was rocking all night maybe it was a friday but the wine the food the atmosphere it is all intoxicating !
4
This place was the busiest in the area - always a good sign. There was a lovely vibe on a Monday night - reAlly busy with a post work crowd. Didn't actually venture inside as the evening was so warm but the decor looked lovely. We enjoyed tapas and pizza with Belgum beer- a very eclectic mix but a great variety! Would happily go back
3
The service here was extremely poor. We waited several minutes to be seated with waiters walking passed us without acknowledging us - in the end we had to approach one to ask for a table. The food is reasonably priced and I enjoyed the wine they recommended with my salad. The outdoor seating was very pleasant - a welcome break from freezing air con
5
If your looking for cheap eats and cheap wine this is the place to head. Huge wine menu that is by far one of the cheapest on the island, food is nice and the location is central.
5
Great food and service. We ordered a number of tapas items (meatballs, olives, rice balls and eggplant). We also ordered a Greek salad and pizza. All were delicious and the service was fantastic.
5
Great good at reasonable prices for Singapore! Atmosphere was fun, very busy but we didn't have to wait. Spare ribs at $16++ was fantastic as was their virgin mojito.
Would highly recommend!
4
The staffs are kind and warm. It was outstanding.. Great variety of wines and cheeses, value for money for small bites.. Cosby ambiance and comfortable sitting areas. It worth coming back to dine with groups of friends to dine and chill out.
4
A very large, busy, loud and happening place... everybody is out and enjoying themselves and either having tapas with wine, or something from the menu (pasta, pizza, steak or some European classics) with wine. Food is good to excellent. Prices are good. Especially the prices of the wines (by the glass) are good compared to what you normally pay in Singapore. Service is pleasant and attentive.The company seems to have taken over the entire building... with the very large tapas bar & bistro (with both indoor and outdoor seating), and then next door the cheese bar and the wine shop
5
If you can't make up your mind for dinner ... try this place. Spanish/European cuisine and good but reasonably priced wines. Indoor and outdoor seating is great arranged, staff is caring. Three options ... the wine shop, the tappas bar or the cheese bar. We are there every few weeks. See you there.
4
There are some outlets of Wine Connection but I think they have different theme, One of the outlets we visited last month was Wine Connection Tapas Bar & Bistro. We enjoyed the outside seating area where they use big barrel as tables with a bottle of Wine and accompanies with some Tapas like Gambas, Mix Platter of Parma Ham, Cheese & bread. They also have some heavy meal like Pasta of which our son ordered.The food was OK, but the whole experience seating at the outdoor restaurant while watching people walking around is more memorable for me
3
Went with a friend for dinner on a Friday night. You'll need a booking if you want to come here on a weekend. Being so busy, service wasn't too good, but the food was ok. They had a good selection of wines, but if you can, get a table inside as it was very warm outside.
5
The place to be in Singapore for wine drinking over catching up with friends. Vast collection of wines and priced very reasonably. Great selection of cheese too. Went there on a weekend late evening for cheese and wine. Not the best location with a view for sight seeing, but still it had a decent crowd. Will definitely come back again during my next visit to Singapore
4
All in all very nice. Tapas are a bit small but delicious and worth it. I was going economical and sticking with the 30-50 dollar wines, so as expected the quality of those price ranges were really not great.. but met my expectation for Singapore standards on alcohol quality vs pricing.
4
Visited here on our first night in Singapore. Service is good considering how busy it was. Wine and Beers were good value. We shared plates of food and these were very tasty.
5
We stopped at Wine Connection for a quick glass of wine after dinner at a different location. Always a great selection of wines and service was outstanding. Look forward to returning again soon.
4
Went for drinks with skme friends on a friday night.
Nice place with affordable food and drinks.
Would consider returning with my friends again some day.
5
Good tuna steak and wine selection. Very good recommendation from anil and Alex team. We will definitely come back again here.
4
Straightforward but good quality and reasonably priced (by Singapore standards) eatery set a little back from Robertson Quay. It was a busy Saturday night but we were served promptly and politely; the food was fine and there was plenty of choice. An extensive wine list. Good vibe
5
We loved this place, best service and atmosphere in the City. Anil really looked after us. Ate here and the food was excellent and good value, will come back again. Anil was happy and enjoyed working for Wine Connection and working for his manager and for his training from his restaurant manager Mr Kelvin. Good work Mr Kelvin.
5
Really enjoyed this restaurant. We have been to Singapore many times and this is the first time we have found wine at a reasonable price. Lovely Tapas and appetizers (especially the New Zealand Mussels and Foie Gras Kebab) made a great lunch and there was a good selection of food for an evening meal. Staff were always friendly, service was quick and there was a nice atmosphere, although a little noisy in the evening. Another plus was the late opening as we needed to eat after 10.00 p.m. We like to eat outside so the roadside location was not ideal and we were unimpressed by the public toilet we were directed to. Despite this we returned several times and would definitely go again if we return to Singapore
4
Visit this place at least once a month. Good place for a friends' gathering after office hours. Young crowd, fast service, a good choice of dishes and of course a wide range of wines. Location is convenient - there are other restaurants and bars around with locals & tourists. Restrooms (shared with other bars) located quite a distance and untidy, duh. Two bottles of wine would cost you from $30++Dishes - from $15++Nice for a group of friends, couples, solo
4
Up front the food was good however I was somewhat surprised at being charged $2 for a tablespoon of Parmesan for my spaghetti! Any other restaurant I have been to, when served pasta, would ask if you would like Parmesan and then freshly grate some for you.  The service was good and friendly
2
Ordered the seafood pasta, and the seafood were evidently made from the frozen variety as they didn't taste particularly fresh. We waited for almost 40 minutes for the food even though there were only 3 tables at that time. When we informed the waiter that the pasta was over cooked, his reply was a dismal "oh ok". With no offer to fix the pasta or anything. Wines were cheap, but that's simply because they are poor in quality. Come here if you are on a budget and wish to scrimp on your meals, but wouldn't mind compromised quality
5
Good food, good service and nice atmosphere! A pleasant surprise for us here in Singapore. The wait staff was very prompt and attentive. Would definitely go back.
5
Excellent quality of the food and the wine choice is even better at a very friendly price. Very friendly stuff (which is a must for Singapore actually). Highly recommended for a casual dinner with Italian food, wine and friends.
4
We had a lovely evening at the Wine Connection. We only went here for a drink unfortunately not for diner. Staff was great, only one point small critical point.. unfortunately there is no WIFI on the terrace.
5
We were told of this place by a passerby. Went in for a snack dinner. Had a pizza and a glass of wine. Great service, reasonable price and very popular.
5
This place I really love, food was fantastic, atmosfeer very nice, price very good, I had the home made Duck foie as a starter, later chorizo fettuccini and as desert the apple crumble, the apple crumble was nice taste but not looking so nice as on the photo. Good assortment of wine. I will be definitively coming back here when I go to Singapore again
5
I went to this place with my colleagues and luckily we made a reservation before we come otherwise we need to wait for getting a table. I ordered pinot noir to accompany my steak . The ambience , food and service was great. Just some idea : maybe they can play a acoustic live music in some corner of restaurant
4
Limited but good selection of wines which range from the not too expensive (given that it is Singapore); friendly attentive service. We had tapas- excellent prawns in wasabi, good meatballs, poor calamari (too thinly sliced and over cooked), bland mozzarella (well it is mozzarella, I suppose).We did not try the main courses - paella was about $34.Convenient for Clarke Quay if you want to go on partying.On balance I liked it and would go there again
3
The Service is spot on and the prices are fair. But you pay for what you get. A bit disappointed in the appetiser soups. Both tasted like Rehydrated Powder Soups but I guess what do you expect for 7 SGD. My Parma ham and Mozzarella Salad was ok but only had two slivers of Parma Ham and one slice of cheese. Again what do you expect for 15 SGD. My wife had Seafood Pasta that was all right, again as to expected for 15 SGD. My glass of French Pinot 16.00 SGD Ice tea 4.50 SGD and sparkling water 7.00 SGD all fine. I guess my point is if you're going to the Wine connection for the Cheese and Meat Plate and sharing a few bottles of reasonably priced plonk, perfect spot. However for a few bucks more you could do much better for lunch around the cit
5
This is a busy restaurant with a great atmosphere, lovely decor and as for the food we had the tenderloin which was excellent could not fault the food or service. Great wine list. We enjoyed our evening so much we retuned before leaving Singapore for lunch had a Tuna salad great portion size and very tasty. All in all wonderful food and affordable price
4
The restaurant was close to our hotel and we both enjoyed the food on our first visit so we returned 2 further evenings. The selection is extensive and the menu is illustrated, so you get a good idea of what to expect. On the first evening we had steak with a Greek salad, the second evening, pizzas and the third - poached salmon, salad and a bottle of wine. I wouldn't order the avocado salad - very little avocado and plenty of rocket - the assistant manager, Zack was very courteous and changed it for an alternative and the overall service excellent. I would highly recommend a visit
5
We will definitely be coming back. Great Tapas and platters (loved the cold-cut one) and surprisingly affordable for the area.
4
Spent a very pleasant evening, great atmosphere , nice food at reasonable price, attentive and knowledgable staff, especially Evan went out of his way to accommodate special requests and was very good at recommending dishes
5
Friendly, fast service, great food und affordable tasty wine!
Will come back always. Thanks for a great experience again!
4
Busy place with a lot of noise of music and guests, great steak, nice wine and very reasonably priced. Above all, service is good: friendly, fast and they know what it is all about. Lovely!
1
Avoid the tiramisu! Does not seem fresh, even though they say they make it every day... Should definitely change the recipe!
5
Alex was amazing host.....introduced the sliders and kept us informed.....excellent service with great food.
Great selection of wine.....suggest to keep Spanish Creanza too!
5
We went to this restaurant based on Trip Advisor reviews and we were not disappointed. The place was extremely busy but the service and the friendliness of the staff was first rate. Based on our experience we went back for a second visit. The menu variety and pricing was extremely attractive ( both food and drinks) and this is one stop you should go to when you visit Singapor
5
Went there with a bunch of friends about 2 weeks back. One of their staff members, Neel, took great care of us from ensuring our glasses were always topped up and food orders arrived fresh and hot! Neel - thanks a bunch for being such a warm soul! Keep smiling and soaring to greater heights
4
I am a frequent visitor at Wine Connection, mostly at the Cuppage outlet. No doubt the wine collection is amazing and the prices are even greater. Keeping the wine collection aside, this place could do a bit of revamp to their food menu. I remember going there 4 years ago and fell in love with their cheese platter but now the cheese platter looks ordinary. They could add on to their starter menu to introduce more tapas menu. Service can get a little slow during rush hours. But hands down, one of the best place to enjoy your wine without burning a hole in your pocket
5
It was introduced by one of my friend as a good place to get together and having dinner as one.. They have a wide array of dishes and i so love the wine collections! I personally like their Paua Bay with a reasonable price that goes along with Spanish Gambas and assorted platter... At that time, it was so humid that we decided to enjoy our dishes outside. They have this place with music that making the mood very pleasing and waiter Milton gave us a very excellent service by checking our table every now and then, making sure everything was served perfectly... I will keep coming back here not only to dine with friends but i would also recommend to families and more to lovers to have their romantic date. The food was terrific and the wine was perfect for it..
5
I had a good time at Wine Connection the wine is nice and the special thanks to Anu who really did a good job.
5
I have been regular customer of Wine Connection. Love the food and ambience. I had recently visited and Our server Mr. Neel by Alex Team did a wonderful job. I would rate their service 10/10.
5
Had a great time and awesome service with neel. Please get more staff like him. Cheers. Good luck and keep attracting the best people.
5
A wonderful way to unwind after a stressful week! Excellent service by Alex and Jasinder. Gorgeous selections of wine and tapas. Perfect ambience to unwind to the weekend!🍻
4
I'm a frequent visitor to Singapor, and fan of Tapas, they offer great food, with Resonable Prices, I love their Tortola
5
Thanks Taqi!!!!!! For the good time, excellent service, great food and suburbe wine collection. Really a must go when you are in Singapore.
5
Dinner was awesome, Alex and Neel made our night. Nice to have somewhere that was pet friendly. Great wine. Good food. Happy days.
5
Regular over here. With friends and colleagues. Nice place to hang out after work. Staffs remember and recognise their customers. Overall we had a good experience but the process of the bill turned us down a bit. The staffs are really humble and they really know how to take care of their customers..i hope the management can do something about the process of billing. Rest of issues 5 stars definitely. Always come back here for good wine and good service.
3
I've been introduce to this wine bar by the locals and its pretty impressive when i saw the crowds and the amount of wines display.The only concern for this bar is the entrance to the outlet.I've been directed to one end to the other just to get a seat which I do believe its unnecessary with the amount of senior staffs working on floor which had ignore the waiting customer.Overall the experience was not too bad, other than the start off before seating
5
One of the best service I have ever had. We ordered Quattro formaggi and it was Super yumService was great, efficient and friendly. Kudos to Neel for attending us well for the couple of hours we were at Wine Connection. Would love to come back for service by this charming fellow once again!
5
Free flow of Australian white, red and moscato for 2hrs at $29+ . Food are excellent and price are reasonable. Going again on Friday to celebrate friend birthday.
5
Amazing wines, had a really nice time and our wines were filled to the Brim! Awesome time, I'll come back again with friends for sure. Thanks Alex and Igor!
5
Excellent night. Alex, look for Alex. Australian Wine Night is Awesome. Had really good fun. Well done guys. Everyone is great fun. Special thanks to Ravee, Tiger, Jas, Tom, Manoj, Mohan... From Alex's Team!!! They made our night so.......... HAPPY.
5
Awesome night. Good food, good wine & good vibes. We had a really nice waiter. Definitely recommend coming here for a good night out!
5
I absolutely looove this place! You can get some great value wine, especially when compared to usual Singapore prices, in a classy and relaxed environment. Plus, the food is also in a very affordable price range! I absolutely recommend it!
5
Drinks and food are great, attentive staff and really well looked after by Alex and his team. Ideal spot for evening drinks and/or dinner.
5
I visited the wine connection outlet Tapas Bar & Bistro at Robertson walk on 2 April, it was a celebration for my birthday. The admostphere was great, service was excellent. The staff were very attentive and actively running about. We were served by Alex, I believe he was the supervisor or so..he was very professional - he recommended a very good wine selection and we enjoyed it. Moreover, his food recommendation was also very good - his service and his knowledge on the food and beverage was amazing. Overall a satisfied trip, went back a few days later, this time with colleagues and again it was an awesome evening - I will definitely go back again soon. Great place to be at..
5
Me and my Friend popped by for the first time as we were attracted by the ambience and setup of the place. The staffs were all very approachable and especially one that is call manoj introduced by Alex. He helped us with suggestions in the menu and the desserts were specially good. We will definitely be back again for the second time. Definitely a good place to chill with your friends. :) 5 stars

personally i prefer going to wine connection cheese which is just right beside but it was full there so we came here to check it out and amazingly managed to get a table. the wines here are well priced for the quality that you pay for. but the main takeaway was the staff Alex who was very friendly and cheerful, stopping by every once in a while to check on us and to share with us about wine. his service ensured that we enjoyed ourselve
5
Had amazing time here with my friends , its the best place to chill out with your friends... Been here for or few years and the service is getting warmer and warmer. Thank you for the great place! We will come back for alex for great service.

Best value wine in Singapore, awesome extensive menu and the service is attentive and helpful. Must visit when in Singapore, for tourists and locals alike!
5
Enjoy a good time out with friends here! Great servicing from the friendly waiters! Long list of wine n moscato to choose from n nice food serving!

The paella is great! Loved the ambiance :)

5
Good place to hang out and the staff is so friendly! Perfect for girl night out especially Evan from Alex team! Taking care of us very well :)

Nice spot on Robertson walk, looking over the square. Feels like a quality place without extortionate prices. Was a bit hard work to get served (which is a real bugbear for me). Also I ordered extra toppings for my pizza, which weren't added. Food was tasty, as were the wine and cocktails. A solid place to go to if you are in the area, but won't set your world on fire
3
Both the food and the environment are okay but service is way too bad. They just simply charge for a cake that we brought over to celebrate our friend's birthday.
4
The title says it all. The food tastes nice and is nicely presented; the staff is attentive and service is prompt and i'm enjoying a nice quiet time while I enjoy a thin crust tasty four cheese pizza.
Thanks Johann for the service!
5
Pleasure time with friend & nice food & Drink for my birthday night,thank you Alex teams for your good service , hopefully we will come back again :)
5
This is a great place with great food and service. Alex, Evan, and Eun Bi were very friendly and attentive. I would recommend it highly.
5
Had Really Great Time in wine Connection tapas bar with Friends, good selections of wine, excellent Food , And i would like to give 5 Star to service special thanks to Alex And Hof Team, raj And neel was super attentive. Will Come back for sur

It's a chaine of restaurants but I know only his. Night time the neighborhood is very lively especially on,Fridays and Saturdays after work. Lot bars and restaurants of course but has large selection of wines from all over the world and they are good and not expensive. Even almost the cbeapest are good enough (good value for money),service is good hoever they push to much to consume. Snacks are good too, cheeses but also grilled prawns and so. When leaving you can go their wine shop and get something for you...always at boo lric
5
The food is very good, the wine also (not strange due to the name of the restaurant. A strange thing was after the first (per) glass of wine i could not order the next glass. another wine i ordered was also after checking not possible to order. Finally I have to ask which white wine I could order per glass
5
There are two menus, one for Tapas and the other is a regular menu. The prices are reasonable and you do get a descent portion. The wines are affordable and the food was fresh. I had the ahi tuna steak and it was so delicious that it melted in my mouth. There is a wide range of choices from salads, pastas, fish, seafood, meats and a yummy dessert menu. The area is also quite quaint as it by the river and there are many other restaurants and bars to go to
5
Excellent service for a restaurant based in Singapore.I am a local and it's no secret that our restaurants here are not famous for their customer service (even though we are "forced" to pay service charge). However, Wine Connection took me by surprise when i went there last week to celebrate my boyfriend's birthday with his friends.I had made reservations for 15 pax at 7pm (which was their last reservation time slot) and even though most of us arrived late, they never made a fuss about it or give away our tables to other customers (considering they are always crowded). Unfortunately, many of friends, whom had previously turned down the invitation, decided to join us (impromptu!). I was pretty anxious because i had not made reservations for the late-comers and the restaurant was filled with people as every other saturday night. I seeked the help of the staffs and they were extremely accommodating and tried their best to cater to my last minute plans. In the end 5 more friends joined us and everyone had an amazing time.My overall rating would be for the staffs as they all kept a smile on their services throughout the night even though i could see how pressurizing and chaotic their job was (yes it was really really crowded). I also requested for a dessert with a candle for the birthday celebrator and they were more than willing to help. Food was served in good portions and was delicious. Obviously, known for their fine range of wines, i enjoyed that as well. Special shout-out to Raga, whose jokes and quirks we especially adored.And yes, one of my favorite restaurants in Singapore
4
Came here for another visit for a beer and some tapas with a friend after work. The place was pretty full despite being a Monday night. Service was good, food was good and the beers were also decent. Prices remain very reasonable. I'll be back again in the not too distant future
4
Great place for dates, family, friends dinner.. Awesome food, great value for wines in singapore.. Good service by Neel and hui Ling

It was really nice experience having a wine and food . Our table attendant Neel was really helpful. Special thanks to his kind service

I frequent this outlet and it is a pleasure for me and my friends, excellent ambience with a nice concept.
Special thanks to great recommendations by manoj.
5
Nice ambiance, food was fantastic, and terrific service by staff specially Milton. That was the first time we've been there to hangout with my friends and we enjoyed a lot. Love the Prawns, Ribeye in Surf and Turf Platter, and specially tapas. With such mouth-watering dishes, the Captain named Milton was very helpful. He recommended us to drink Momo wine and it goes perfectly well with our food.. With sumptuous meal that's worth eating for, would definitely be going back there again to taste more of their menus and be pampered by staff. Recommended
5
Team of FC Mariners came to tapas bar o celebrate end of season and victory last game of the season Div 1. Here is very lovely place and feeling so comfortable and very kindly and special thanks to Taqi from Alex team for that great service tonight
5
I just have to come back to wine connection as their service orientation is one of the best.They can really handle my previous incident whereby one of the customer glass broke and gotten into our food.One of the staff wanted to replace us with new orders and which they really replace us with some starters.Thanks for their excellent service
5
The best place to hang out at! Great selection of wine and food! Service was great, efficient and prompt! Manoj, the waiter is awesome! Will come back again! ^^ Thank you wine connection for the awesome service!

Bad Sunday NightI had a bad experience yesterday nights , shop close at 12 midnight 10:30pm - asking for pay the bill11:00pm - not allow order for any additional wine 11:15pm - close the wall fan although we still sitting there, after few min complaint open back the wall fan11:20pm - close the wall fan again and collect back the wine glass without asking .First time and the last time here. So bad experience

My wife and i live a street over and dine at all three outlets and are wine club members at their wine store at Robertson Quay. Lately the staff has changed and there is an odd aloofness and coldness in the greeting that never existed before. Today I asked if a case of wine could be purchased and delivered 200 meters away to my home. "Sorry sir there are only three of us here today, cannot". Three people and no customers. And three outlets to from which to ask for help. I went to another wine store and spent my $820. I hope the owner does some training and reorientation of the team in the wine store because this is a place I have raved about for years and would like to continue to enjoy its former hospitality
4
Great value and superb wines! Very attentive and helpful staff! A definite recommendation to all my friends! The atmosphere is great and location is lovely! Thumbs up
5
Had a great time and the wine selection is excellent. Food is amazing. Great service by Ravi, Evan and Fadli. Thanks for taking care of us.

Wonderful hosts!
Ravee & Evan from Alex's team are simply great! We had a great time! Good wine recommendations! Definitely will be back for more!😘

Thoroughly enjoyed my evening. Excellent service from Alex and team (Ravi Raj Evan Fadli Wanda).
Surf and turf tremendous. Paella likewise.
5
Great service with very responsive personnel. Had an awesome time with friends and would love to recommend to my gang of partygoers. Neel, jasinder, Jude, Raj, Ravi, fadli from Alex team. Very memorable service whenever I've been here with friends. Love these guys!
5
Awesome drinks big thank you to Alex, tom and Jude for taking care of us awesome night will be back again
This is a super night
5
Great servers and always good times.
It started to rain and they moved our tables so we could stay dry and continue our fun.
5
We came for dinner and good wine and tapas with friends. Food is fantastic, specially cheese plater and calamari,. If you want to try something to share, give it try a surf and turf, good choices of meat, the wine recommendation was great, we tried Spanish wines. Service had personal touch, very attentive and helpful, I would strongly recommend this place, at least give it try for once, you won't regret!!!!!!!special thanks to Alex, he was really nice and friendly!!
5
the place you can go always and never have to worry about quality of food, reasonable prices, good wines and fast service.... it's just great.... food variety is amazing, food portions very generous and very reasonable priced. 30 different wines by glass !!! who can offer this ? right, nobody else... if you look some place for family to go, with friends to go or with visitors to go.... just go and enjoy... I will go again tonight
5
Had dinner at the Tapas bar and thoroughly enjoyed everything about this restaurant. Atmosphere great, service great, food great and prices very reasonable especially wine by the glass. We didn't have a reservation and were lucky to get a table. Thank goodness we did. Highly recommend and will definitely go back
5
Best resto on Rob Quay. Good value and attentive service. Good food and wine selection too. Just down the road and took bones home for Dog
4
Milton is of the nicest people at wine connection! Le flumes blanc is a must try if you love a nice cold crisp wine! Worth a visit
4
I've been to wine connection multiple times, and the wine choices are always great! Favorite pizza has to be the Carnivore pizza. Great service as well, I would recommend sitting in Milton's area of service as he's quick and always very polite!
4
Great service provided by the manager of the night and milton. Handled an accident at the restaurant very well too
5
Wine connection- an awesome experience...Glad to have met Neel and Alex here...they were outstanding with their service...
5
It was a usual night then the service we got turned it to an awesome night. I'm new in Singapore yet I found the place I want to go as a regular customer. The manager helped us out for the best food we totally enjoyed. And for the beer that balances the rest of the night! - visited in March with locals :
3
We visited the place to get some tapas and wine, and place is very nice. The waiters are polite, and very good. The wine selection was fine - we enjoyed some nicely cooled white wine. The tapas was average and would have been much better if some tapenade had follow the meat platter. But would go there again for the place and wine :-)
5
We went Thursday night with 6 x people, it was so clouded. I highly recommend this restaurant for even business use. The food is simply so nice with resonable prices! The staff is so friendly and I especially appreciated for Korean staff - Merida san! My customer and boss were so satisfied! Thank you
5
My family and I visited here few weeks ago during our holiday in Singapore. We were welcomed by one of the friendly hosts. This is our first time in this restaurant nearby our hotel... The food tasted excellent especially Gambas, duck breasts and amazing Spanish paella! Were amazed by the services team as well- our server Ravee and Jude introduced by Alex who seems to be the one was leading the team. Jude and Ravee was really attentive and it looked like they really enjoy working here! We will definitely recommend this great restaurant to our friends and we totally look forward to come here next time when we are Singapore again
5
We had great tapas (wasabi pawn, pan fried mozzarella...) with 5 friends for the first time at Wine Connection and enjoyed 3 bottles during 2 hours with the staff. It was recommended by other friends and we had great atmosphere. Sit outside for best view (Table24). Brillant service, very attentive, always making sure our glasses were full. Thank you team, thank you Alex
5
Loved the birds and bees wine.. and the total ambience of the place. Loved it!! Anil was one of the awesome server we ever Accor in Singapore .
5
Jude, Ravee, Raga, Sugu from Alex team took really good care of us. Good recommendations on wine and food. Rocket pizza was awesome! Always come back!
5
Special shoutout to Anil (a.k.a Neel). Hard to find smiling faces serving you food in Singapore these days. Good value food and great ambience.
5
Had plenty of fun with my friends. Food are fantastic and serve within reasonable timing. Staff are very friendly and answer to our needs
5
Come here very regularly as I love the atmosphere which is complemented by the great service in and out the restaurant. Many smiles and very attentive staff under the supervision of Alex. You can see the staff is enjoying which also makes the guests at ease. This creates an amazing atmosphere. Special thanks to Jude who would already be at your table before you realized you actually need him - he's quick, polite and very attentive. Will keep coming back
5
Wine are always up to my expectation. Service is so good . Esp Alex. Chinese servers need to put in more effort in learning English. esp those who are new, it is always better to get the staff ready and easy.Gambas is always the BEST DISH OF MINE
5
This place needs no introduction with both the local and expat community here and is easily the coolest place to hang out in the evenings. But living in the neighborhood I go to WC regularly for lunch and find it excellent value for the location, big wine menu, food and service. The place is perfect both for business lunch as well as for just chilling out. I must mention the excellent ever smiling and consistent service by generally all the staff and specially Manny and Jerriek during lunch . Keep it up ..... !!
4
Want a relaxed, fun evening with good bubbly and good food.....this is a great place for it! Recently introduced to this restaurant, its fast becoming a fav place to hang out..... good food, good wines....great staff! The staff is warm & welcoming......and look after you well! I am loving the relaxed, open and large setting of the restaurant! Give it a try, you wouldn't be disappointed
5
Kudos to the Wine Connection team. The family has ventured there many times over the past 6 months and not one bad experience. Waiters are organised, food menu is easy to navigate, timing to receive orders is good and the place is busy - always... Best priced wine i have been able to find at a restaurant style establishment. Get there early to avoid waiting in a queue too long.
5
We visited this restaurant during lunch and Mr. Manny happily welcomed us and found us comfortable seats. We asked him what foods he can suggest us to have and he mentioned several foods and drinks. And hey, we can say that he actually knew the menu - we were very impressed! We got pasta (chorizo fettucini), carnivore pizza and wines (chianti riserva) and these are very nice!So, excellent service, nice food and delightful ambiance - we will definitely come back and recommend this place!!
5
As a regular in wine connection I absolutely love the place! Good prices for food and drink, expect friendly!! Look for Alex for the best service in singapore!
4
Fantastic food & wine. Excellent staff (Alex & his team) very friendly with brilliant service, would really recommend this place.
5
Lunch today was excellent. Tasty reasonably priced food. Attentive friendly staff who made us feel very welcome. Would definitely recommend to friends.
5
Had great service from Alex and Jerriek with a great Valentines Day selection. Multiple visits to this location and will certainly be back. Table B19A on the patio allows for nice fresh air and good people watching.
5
Great service, well above the usual service you receive in Singapore. Alex was extremely friendly and personable. I hope the rest of his colleagues can learn from him.
Service 5 star!!!
5
Outstanding service goes to the floor staff / team - Alex & Team (Evan, Roger, Alan, Jack) It was my first time in Wine Connection and the experience was very homely and accommodating. Alex gave us good selection of wine and advice in a addition to providing us with great insights about the food (which we have yet to try). Such service deserves well recognition and therefore a 2nd visit will be definite. Keep it up guys
4
Wine connection tapas bar & bistro is really nice place to sit and enjoy the Singapore evening. Food is good, I ate several meals including meat, pasta, fish and salad. Only minus was the unclear valentine promotion package that we did not get.. Also the language skills of some waitresses was littlebit poor and we had to ask same things several times. But that did not ruin our experience about the wonderful place.Alex, Neel and Jude are the one to meet. They keep their customers happy
5
Was very hard to get a seat on this big day but the Operation Manager (I guess he is), Mr Alex and his team, Miss Ain and Mr Evan were very helpful to find us a seat. They were very attentive to our requests. We had a very good time here and surprised on the service we received from his team. Will definitely visit again, looking for Mr Alex and his team
4
Had a late night with my wife and another couple. We were seated outside under the care of Alex and his team. They were splendid! We had a bottle of red and a cheese platter. We were contemplatig on aother bottle of red and the ladies wanted to try something sweeter. Alex recommended, "Birds & Bees; Sweet Malbec" It was a great recommendation and all of us enjoyed it! Keep up the great work, Alex and team (Evan, Ravi & Raj)
5
We had a wonderful evening at wine connection yesterday . The cheese platter is awesome and the tapas are fab and worth the money spent . Excellent service by Alex who kept coming back to check if we were comfortable / Abd if we needed any more drinks / snacks . Keep up the good work and great customer service !
5
We had a great time. We were a group of french guys celebrating a gettogether and were very pleased with the help, smiles and great service from the team here. Would recommend it to anyone who wants to have good food at a reasonable price!
5
Amazing place, super good wine and wonderful service specially Alex who treat us as King!
Always available for us served very fast, wonderful area !
5
Alex and the team is really helpful and cool, we had a great time there and I can only recommend it !!! We will come back for sure and have some more of the good pizza and wine ...
5
Wine connection has a fantastic atmosphere and is a good place ti gi wjth friends for a chilled dinner. Highlight is Milton who was an amazing waiter and good fun.
4
Went there with three 3 friends and polished off a number of bottles of "Fat B......" Chardonnay at a very reasonable $45 per bottle. Had some tapas- the pick of which was the pan fried mozzarella. Followed this up with some pizza (which apparently was good) and some paella which was fine. The food here is not anything special but the drinks are well priced, service was good and the place was lively on a Thursday night. It is quite a large space but does not feel cavernous. I would recommend it for a casual night out that doesn't break the bank
5
I have been visiting the Wine Connection Tapas Bar for a very long time but somehow it feels like it's improving and getting better everytime I pay a new visit there. Aside from the food and drink being excellent in terms of quality and price, the level of attention and friendliness of the personnel beats any other similar place in Singapore. On my last couple of visits I came across this new person called Alex who seemed like he was the manager there. He was superb at controlling his team and making sure everyone was happy and having a great time. He handled it like it was his second nature. You have certainly won me as a loyal customer! Thank you
3
We went to Wine Connection Tapas Bar because there was no wait tonight. The food there is decent for the price. The atmosphere is good for a casual night with friends. Service in the beginning was great but the moment the place got full, it slowed considerably
5
I went to Wine Connection a couple of weeks ago 29FEB Friday with an old dear friend from my Virgin Atlantic days who now runs a consultancy in London. We had a great evening which was made even better by the staff involved. I think we drank about three bottles of wine but the wine waiter/manager I'm not sure what his position is, is a great guy, He told us to buy bottles not glasses, was all round saving us money. Its not often you see that. Was he part of the owners of Wine connection? I am a die hard recommender for you guys as a result. Chapeau
4
Singapore has a well deserved reputation for great food at most price points. However it doesn't have the best reputation for service.Personally I think you get what you encourage.We met Vavo, a manager, at lunch time and every time I have met him he is on the go, non stop and excellent with his service.By coincidence we popped in in the evening and this time I so pleased to met the acquaintance of Alex -Great guy, good sense of humour & excellent service. Here is an example...I was debating whether this lady was wearing a wig and asked him adjudicate between us, He went over to pretend to talk to a waiter serving the lady and winked back at me now he has got up close and personal and checked the hair at close range! Naughty, but fun.We had a pizza (meat lovers) and agreed that it was better quality than Spizza who a local chain that specialise in pizza. Great price and good quality wines. Good service and food - you can see why this is almost a weekly treat! Try it
4
Saturday evening (6 Feb 2016) about 7.30pm and most places just beginning to get going, but not Wine Connection. A large space and already nearly full - great recommendation. The menu is basic but plentiful, and prices very noticeably cheaper than everywhere else in the area. We ordered appetisers and mains and within 5 minutes we were tucking in to our first courses - fois-gras and mozzarella/tomatoes. As soon as we had emptied our plates the mains arrived - ribeye for me and sea bass for Mrs. F-F. Finished off with crime brûlée. Overall excellent food and wines, and very quick - perhaps too quick, but at these prices I can accept that. Zack and the team were very friendly and super-efficient (normally a mutually exclusive combination). Thank you
4
Good selection of wine and food for decent prices in this city. The international draft beers are not bad either and the staff was very friendly.
We will again pay a visit.
5
Amazing service by Raga, awesome service he made the trip worthwhile - food was excellent and great ambience
4
Going by Singapore prices the Wine Connection represents excellent value with a good range of wines
The Singapore maxim "cheap and good" certainly applies here
We found the service excellent and Alex was friendly and informative
We will return
5
I was seven days every day and was always very correctly and efficiently . The selection of wines is more than good, personnel very friendly.
4
I've walked past here so many times, and I've bought wine and cheese from their original shops many times. First off, this is a great, casual place. It's not pretentious at all, and there were plenty of staff running around. The tapas was okay, but nothing particularly special. The share platters were good value. The wine is where this place shines (just like its bottle shop). Glasses start at $8, which is incredible in Singapore. And they have a good range. Worth stopping by for a quick, pleasant meal.
3
We were a group of 4 visited this place last night. We ordered ;X2 Bottle of Alma Mora-Melbec which was very good. Calamari was super soggy and tasteless. After I saw my other two friends tried and comments, I tried too and it was so bad. I called staff to inform that Calamari should be firm and crispy not soggy like this. He take it away and came back after put more paprika on the top of it. So, later I had to asked for manager and got it changed to the meat ball. So, this dish is very bad.. Do Not order it. Gambas was the excellent dish for the whole order.  Meat ball was Ok. Greek Salad was ok. Chorizo Pizza was above average. Fried Parma and mozzarella wasn't what I expected. Marinated butter beans & Mixed olives was OK. In my opinion, cuppage road branch had a little bit better quality for foods
5
Had great service and even more amazing wine. Served by our new favourite person - Alex! Ask for the Cape Town stories try the tapas and the wine list is amazing too! Best to come with friends and enjoy a great night out!!!! Look for Alex and the team!
5
Dear Staff & Management @ Wine Connection: Thank you very much for hosting a very memorable event on Saturday, January 30th for us. We had a group of 45 guests and we were served exceptionally well by Alex and his team including Raj and Jess. We were given access to almost 80% of the outdoor patio and everyone managed to mingle and converse while enjoying the large selection of Tapas and Wine. We were extremely pleased with the service especially on how Alex was able to serve each customer individually on their order and payment even though we were such a large group. I hope to host more such events at this venue!! Best regards, Vino
5
I had an amazing experience at Wine Connection Tapas Bar ! The wine list is awesome and especially Alex who has been of great help and had an amazing personalized service ! If you want to enjoy the same level of service, you'd better find him !
2
My friend had her birthday dinner here and while the food, the ambience, the music was commendable, I have to say that we were disappointed with how the service turned out. We ordered some food and ofcourse, wine. The waiter who attended us looks uninterested in getting our order, which I really understand maybe he was having a rough day or what. It wasn't busy that time since only 1/3 of the tables were occupied. Anyway, the food has arrived and we were waiting for the wine and has followed up on it twice but it was still not arriving. When we followed up on it again, apparently, it was never posted as an order. So our food was cold, the wine took quite long to arrive. What's worse is that those at fault didn't even bother to approach us and apologize. That is just a poor service and it was my friend's birthday. Not coming back
4
Great casual option for drinks. Food menu is simple, but the wine is very reasonably priced, so a great option for catching up with friends over a bottle of wine!
5
My friends and i were well taken care of by Alex, very warm and welcoming! Thank you for all the great recommendations too!
5
Our server Jude has been really comforting and admirable. He was really attentive to our needs. It was really a great night for me and my friends. Will be back again!
5
Great ambiance, service quite good and range of wines excellent.
Very good range of beers also.
For a light lunch at a reasonable price and walk along quay side after,
highly reccomended
4
Nice enviroment and meal here. And we also experience excellent customer service here from trainee Alex. Good job and keep it
4
Went to Wine Connection in July 2015. Great night. Inexpensive considering Singapore.Sat down with family of 5 adults and and 1 baby in a pram. Not a problem. Food simple and tasty and drinks not that expensive considering Singapore.Was very busy and popular. Was recommended this by a local at who advised to stay away from Boat Quay and recommended other places. Ended up going twice over 8 days. Happily go back again
4
Went for dinner with my wife and mother...Big thank you to our waiter Alex. He was very helpful and looked after us all night. Even though it was busy he was always coming over to check all was ok..Food was good and wine is great value.Thank

Paid a suspiciously low amount of $16 for "Assorted Cheese Platter".I find it hilarious how 2 tiny slices of cheese on a huge block of wood is stated as "Assorted".Service: 3*- I think service staffs nowadays have a tendency to try and sneak out of a customers' request for assistance to avoid having to politely reject it; which I think is rather rude. In my opinion, if you're unable to fulfill a customers' request, all the more you should check back on their table and inform them politely.- Staff did not inform what cheese was servedFood: 2*- There are cheese on the platter (2 tiny slices) so it deserves some credit- There are so much salad on it that it looks more like Bush Platter. Lol.Ambience: 3*- Nothing special

We had a variety of dishes from the bbq, mains and tapas Menus which was plentiful and tasty. Everyone enjoyed their meal and what we couldn't finish was wrapped up for us to take home. Really enjoyed the place and would recommend to travellers and locals to have a break from noodles and rice! Quality food at a reasonable price for singapore
4
Although of course the wine selection is decent and reasonably priced, it's also worth considering the beers here. Today I opted for the Memminger Hefeweizen - unfortunately the dark wasn't available so I had to go for the regular light colour. But the beer was still very decent. Worth a visit just for the beer
5
Invited by our clients we went to this nice restaurant and decided to visit the very next days as the food was good as well the wine and staffmembers.
4
Love the range of wine available here and there are quite a few options available by the glass. The place has a great vibe and is perfect to relax with friends, good food and a nice glass of red. We'll definitely be back!
1
Place busy but ordered food & got vegetarian pizza with prawns!!
Staff not friendly & waited ages for bill won't be visiting again!!
4
Belongs to wine distributor so guess what? Good wine list with reasonable prices. Serving mainly tapas to accompany the drinks. Good place to hang out with friends or colleaugues after work.
4
We just had short time available and tried this restaurant. Excellent wine and good food for reasonable price. Will come again.
3
It's difficult to find good wine in Singapore and this place is an exception. I love their selection and reasonable prices, and the fact that they have so many wines available by the glass. The food is pretty good, too. I just wish they would improve the service - seems disorganized and the servers can be a little clueless. Also the music is too loud in parts of the restaurant
5
We really enjoyed this spot! The wine selection was terrific, knowledgeable staff and also a great range of delicious food to choose from. We were heading out to dinner and were satisfied to have a tasting plate, perfect wine matching with help from the staff. Highly recommended and in a great location too
4
This restaurant is in a nice location, frequented by a younger crowd, and it offers good food and drinks. In general it has a nice atmosphere and is worth a visit. Having said that, it's a bit pricey, so I'd suggest having a drink or two and then some appetizers (rather than a full dinner) while relaxing and enjoying some conversations with colleagues.
1
I go out to eat in dozens of cities and hundreds of restaurants. Some good some bad, but never have I been so upset. We waited half an hour to be served. Beside us were people who just wanted water, that took 20 minutes. There were many people working, dont get me wrong, they were all fussing over one table. That's fine. They might be very rich or famous. But at most you only need one person for that not five.Avoid this place like the plague for at least a couple of months, or at the very least on busy days
4
We met a contact and had a drink or two here - the food looked nice but on this occasion we only stopped for an early evening drink and chat. The staff were friendly (I was offered a pile of paper napkins "for your sweat sir" - Singapore heat does that to me!) and the choice of wines good in a country not known for its wine lists... (though my wife tried a white wine and said it should have been a lot better chilled
4
Prices are reasonable and the food is ok.
Alcohol is expensive in Singapore. Here you can drink a wine for a good price.
It is always busy.
Nice area for walking and many cafés around the restaurant.
3
Don't ever come here thinking you'll be in and out in an hour. The service leaves much to be desired (even when it's not busy - where are the wait staff?) but it's the wine selection that keeps us coming back for more.
4
Food wine and beer very good value staff most helpful .whith a most pleasing menue.I will use this restaurant many more times.
5
We have been here at least 20 times, and never disappointed us. Customer service is ok compared to the standards in Singapore, wine is good and for good price (always considering that is Singapore). We always enjoy this place so much
Super recommended
4
Went there with a group of 6 and had a great time. Food was good (although it took a while for it to arrive), reasonably priced and portioned very well. Service was good too. We will definitely come back here again.
4
We were staying at a nearby hotel and chose this place from many others nearby - we were glad we did as the service and atmosphere was good inside.We shared two starters of Cold Cuts Platter and Seafood Pasta. The platter came with a big selection of meats and a sizable portion of bread. The main courses were also good with the Chorizo pizza a recommendation. Good choice of beers to accompany the meal
5
We had a great evening at the place. The food was great and the prices were reasonable. We like the the ambience and the music, though when the DJ started playing around 10pm, the music turns a little weird. Otherwise, the staff were all very attentive, friendly and prompt, especially Martin who always comes with a smile. Keep up the good work!
3
A bit disappointed by that visit. Wine price are correct, but the selection is poor. You can find wines from most of the famous region, but they mainly come from big negociant. Food is also a bit overpriced for what it is. If you want to make discoveries, you can find better wine bar in sg
3
I come here almost weekly or twice a week, but every time ask to go to the front when enter behind. Along the way many empty seats. Then went to the front, no queue n no one to serve. Can't stand this stupid system. Except this guy Martin , new guy, great working attitude who serves us really fast m attended us in seconds!That's service. What's the rest doing??!

It's very good food and nice place, especially .Excellent service from William.
It's reasonable price for food and wines. Defiantly I will introduce and bring more friends to share this place.
5
this place beckons me again and again.wonderful,tasty pasta with pesto,the pizzas absolutely full of delectable toppings are what I enjoyed hereeverytime we reached here and called for the dessert lemon tart,it was OVER.must go there earlier this trip
5
Wine connection may sometimes be understaffed, but the service there stays high.
The staff that shine are the likes of:
Igor
Jude
Jonathan
These are the stand-outs, but not forgetting that the rest of the team make the experience a great one.
3
this place is okay. its always crowded which i dont get why as there is no ambiance in this place. starters are average and staff can be slow. personally not a favorite place of mine and i prefer other bars in the area
5
Started off tonight at th Wine Connection, had tapas and a couple of drinks, followed with a pizza. Sharing a meal always a pleasure. Great service and delicious meal, what more could anyone want. Great atmosphere and nice place generally. Would recommend to anyone visiting Singapore who wanted to had out for the night
1
I am writing this as I am in the restaurant now. The service staff looks extremely unhappy as he took my orders. As I have ordered a bottle of wine, he opened the bottle and threw, yes, threw the wine cork on the table and clank the glasses with the bottle as he poured the wine. Orders were in wrong sequence as the mains and appetizers came together in my small table. Summary. Not a return client here.
4
The place is big, has 2 terraces as well as indoor sitting. It is lively and loud. Service is relaxed but efficient. Suitable for an after-work drink with colleagues or for a casual dinner with friends. The wine menu is extensive with a large selection of bottles and "by the glass" options to choose from. Tapas style food is varied and yummy: cheese platter, pizza, chocolate lava cake, etc... Well worth a visit
5
This is a chain of trendy "tapas' bars, but is really more like a European charcuterie, with great cheeses and cured meats. A friend and I dined there looking for a change from the Thai fare we had been gorging on for days and thought a little tapas was in order. The smell from the deli case was amazing as we entered, but the menu left me less than impressed. There are a few selections of wht is more like antipasti plates, but the traditional Spanish tapa. So if that is wha
4
Good choice of wine choices here and the prices are very reasonable. The food is so so-not fantastic but again - value for money. Pizzas are thin crust; do try the cold cut platter and the cheese platter. My favorite food there is the Gambas prawn served with 2 slices of bread-good accompaniment to the drinks. Desserts were heavenly too - we tried the cheesecake, creme brulee, apple crumble, brownie, chocolate lava cake and i think the apple crumble won hands down. We would like to compliment Jack Teo who waited on our table - very patient, proactive and attentive to our needs - topping up of water. We much appreciate that. Good place for group gatherings. High recommended
5
Was here last night. Our waiter Sue was very nice and attentive. We just had to look at him and he would come to us and ask us if he could be of assistance. We enjoyed the food that was being served and also the impeccable service. Will definitely be here again
4
The atmosphere and the tapas were great. I definitely recommend the risotto balls as they were amazing! Great selection of wine to choose from.
4
had celebrated my husband's birthday at wine connection 2 weeks ago. the service was great, although the food needs some improvement. The crab bisque was too watery. The salmon which we had was too dry.
2
Overall a pretty awful experience. Didn't think much of the menu, the food was not even "average" and the service was frankly nowhere to be seen. Not sure I would go back.
5
I've been coming to wine connection 2-3x per week for drinks after work with friends and the service continues to impress me. They know what wines I normally drink and suggest that when I'm seated.Jude is especially attentive. One of my friends likes his water with lots of ice and another likes lukewarm water, which Jude makes effort to remember our individual preferences. Besides the great food and wines, it's the service of the staff that really brings me back so often. Keep up the good work

Called in on the evening we arrived in Singapore and enjoyed good service, nice tapas and a decent bottle of wine at a reasonable price.A few days later we decided to go back, but it was a very different experience. They had trouble finding us a table as they were very busy, so finally we sat down an ordered a meal and wine, but only one meal arrived. We waited and waited but the other one never came. Finally flagged down a waitress and it was obvious the meal was never ordered.By the time they delivered my husbands meal, I had eaten mine or it would have gone cold. His meal turned out to be inedible, something they has just thrown together and was awful!There was no apology and no adjustment to the billSuch a shame as the first night was great, but no good it they can't be consistent in their servic
3
Nice atmosphere and mix of ages with buzzing atmosphere. Good value (and surprisingly quite delicious) steak ( what darkness would you like?)! inc choice of sauces, chunky fries, and a good ratatouille plus asparagus ($18)Spicy Crab Pasta disappointing as pasta undercooked. Needed something extra with it so I ordered a Caesar salad which was basic but acceptable. Passing pizza smelled very good.Staff very efficient but also friendly. Service quick but we did not feel rushed. As part of Wine Connection group wine choice was extensive and house wine good and very reasonable.Would revisit
1
The paella is amazingly terrible. There is no seasoning in the rice so the taste is bland. The chorizo is burnt and tasteless. A cardboard would taste better. The worst thing about it is the waiter responds to our complaints by saying "I told you so
5
Roberston Quay is a very nice to walk around. Much quieter than Clark Quay and less touristy than Boat Quay. I went to Wine Connection there twice.. the last one was this month, a catch up with a friend. Place was crowded but nice, we sat at the bar. Food was very good for the price we paid for at Roberston Quay. Had pizza - lovely thin crust, 3 different type of beer and some tapas. Will go back again definitively
4
Came across this place and gave it a go, good choice.Service was prompt and friendly we came in from one side I of the street and the whole bar and restaurant goes right through into a square where there are additional seats.My friend had the ribs which were excellent, friend saying the best he had had anywhere, I had one of their many varieties of pizza which was superb, all waged down with a couple cold beers, all in all very enjoyable, will return on next visit.Hint, they have Wifi but if you have a table on the street it won't connect, so go inside or near the inside and Wifi works fine, they also have a good wine list though didn't sample any. Worth a visit
5
Feeling overjoyed by the jubilant choice of Old and New World wines at this place, it is easy to overlook just how exquisite and finely judged the offer of little amuse-bouche is at this place:We had warm scrambled egg with truffle oil on crusty Italienate bread with smoked salmon that was served at superbly judged temperature. The seared tuna encrusted in white and black sesame seeds with green salad and kalamata olives captured the essence of Nicoise salad with minimal, but supreme selection of components. The cold cuts of meats came with queen olives and completed our feast.A bottle of Negroamaro from Salento was bursting with the sun of Southern Italy, which we followed up with another of Bordeaux Superieure which raised the stakes and ensured that we completed our little journey in style... Service was cheerful and attentive, and Thiru the assistant manager's attitude meant that we felt welcomed and unobtrusively looked after throughout the evening
1
Awful food. I have no idea why this place is popular.
For a glass of wine and cheese, stick to its sister bar around the corner. To the owner, have some respect for your customer and your staff.
4
The only place in Singapore where you can get wine at an affordable price.
Good tapas menu and plenty of options of wine.
5
Had dinner there on a weekend, great service by one of the waiters I think Sebastian... Food is awesome do try the ribeye... Cheap and good wines on the menu as well 👍🏻👍🏻
4
We visited Friday afternoon. The place was full and despite attentive service we were waiting a long while for our order. The food was inexpensive and that's why I rate high, as there are not many places where 3 persons can dine for less than 100SDG. You will leave full and satisfied, however, it might not be the most unforgettable dinner you had in Singapore. Tapas were ok, lacked seasoning but with some lemon and salt went well. Pity the bread served was stale, the small details are inexpensive and maybe worth taking care of;

My friends and me are regulars at the Robertson Quay Bar and Bistro outlet. Some service staff are ok whilst some seriously needs to undergo more training as they do not meet service standards. For example, at the end of our meal, we had wanted to have dessert and when we requested for the menu from the same service staff TWICE, it never did come. The restaurant was not really crowded as it was a Wednesday night.Second thing I wanted to highlight was that the restaurant indoors was VERY VERY HOT and STUFFY! It cannot be the Singapore weather as when I went to the toilet which was situated outside the restaurant, it was wayyyyyyyyyy much cooler. PLEASE LOOK INTO THE AIR CONDITIONING.Food pricing is reasonable and quality is good. Please bring back the foie gras under the S$5 tapas. That was really good and my friends and me miss it ALOT.The creme brulee dessert used to be fantastic - both taste wise as well as price wise. These days, though the price remains the same, the creme brulee is done terribly. Only the caramalized top part is slightly warm and the bottom of the dessert is COLD. Though is just S$6, I just hope that the chefs have pride in serving their food stuffs, however little they may cost
3
We visited this outlet a few months ago on Friday without reservation. We had to wait for several minutes to be seated. Foods and drinks were quite value for money which is hard to find this in Singapore. Once time Pizza were finished at 7.30 p. m. on Friday night. The whole group got super grumpy. We were even suggested one of waiter to walk to Cold Storage at Ueno square. But he said cannot do it. It's hard to get waiters & waitresses attention here at dinner. In the past few years,if I went to this outlet by myself during 2.30-3.30 p.m. It wasn't any problems for foods, seat or service at all. It's definitely feel more relaxed in mid-day than in the evening.
2
Restaurant has nice ambience but the food lets it down. We ordered the tortilla tapas which was a slice of tasteless potato bake- a relish of some sort would have helped. The parma ham bruschetta were merely two small cold pieces of toasted bread with a slice of parma ham- maybe some fresh fennel and cream cheese or keep it traditional with the inclusion of tomato and fresh basil. The mozzarella croquettes were just that- crumbed and deep fried mozzarella- once again a condiment of some kind would have made this more interesting.The staff were continually hovering and as soon (literally within seconds) as a plate was finished it was taken away. This did not make for a relaxing dining experience
3
Returning to the Wine Connection, one of my favorite western "value" restaurants in Singapore, I realised that this can be a strictly hit-or-miss place. The overall service and food quality remain quite good and along with the decent wine list, it remains excellent value. The recent dinner included their decent calamari fries, but the couscous, which I was trying for a second time, was a bit too dry. They should provide more of the harissa sauce, as well as chickpeas. It is also a bit too meaty, albeit I can't really complain about the merguez
3
We went to Wine Co for a raclette dinner.Super disappointing!Cheese and white wine were goods but cold cuts, potatoes and gherkins not at all!- Cold cuts were really fatty and Parma ham not really good - Potatoes were not cooked enough- Gherkins, instead of being crunchy were soft.. And the taste was not good at all!The menu looks nice but I don't think we will come back for this dish.
5
Hope everyone who reads my review realize that alcohol in Singapore is super expensive!!! However, if you were looking for a place to enjoy wine with reasonable price, here is the place!! There are several branches in the CBD. Therefore, you must check weather the place is for buying only or enjoying in the place. There are lots of selections as well so just enjoy!!
5
I had a fantastic time at wine connection with my best friends in Singapore. Wine & dine, service, music and the ambiance were excellent. This is one of the best restaurants/bars I have tried.
3
good place to grab a beer or a bite. Western styled and it felt like it was mostly filled by office crowd who came there for a beer after work. Good service. Wldn't recommend it if you want a romantic experience.
4
I went to this bar/restaurant in Roberson Quay. The food was good and quite reasonable compared to the food prices in the nearby Clarke Quays restaurants. They had a good wine list and again quite reasonable compared to prices in Clarke Quays.
5
This place is magic.Some weeks I'll go 3 times, and not feel bad about it at all.The service is unreal, quickest in Singapore.The food is epic and the menu is huge. Tasty tapas, really good pizzas, huge salads, $18 steaks, pastas, very very good paella, desserts if you can fit them.$10 pints of beer? Yep.You cannot go wrong. Unless you order the cous cous, it's seriously the only bad item on the menu
5
First time having my dinner at this restaurant and it was indeed a delightful surprise. Food was amazing and the price was reasonable as well! Service staff were really friendly, especially Jonathan (or as his colleagues would address him as JP), who never failed to ensure service satisfaction for the customers whom he attends to. Would definitely be back to dine sometime soon
5
Got a taxi from the hotel to Robertson Quay on a Sunday night. Walked around and found Wine Connection. Place was busy but we got a table inside. There is a great selection of wines and beers both by the bottle and glass. The selection of food was equally good.For starters we had Spicy Spanish Gambas and Green lipped mussels. Both dishes we superb and the spicy prawns really delivered a kick. For mains we had Tenderloin and crusted Tuna. Again both dishes were superb and cooked to perfection exactly as we had asked for,The food was amazing and great value. The wine was great and again very reasonably priced. If you want good food and drink but want a bit more relaxed surroundings along the river then Robertson Quay and Wine Connection are for you.We will be back for the Tapas
5
Amazing value for a Singapore restaurant with consistently good food and service. Most entrees are less than S$15 and you can get a wide assortment of quality wines for less than S$45/bottle. This place has become a favorite for many here in Singapore so get there early.
4
Had dinner and wine with friends. If you don't mind mingling with lots of the international crowds, this would be the place to go for. I personally didn't drink any wine therefore I can't comment on the wine selection and taste that they offered in the bistro. The husband and I shared a cheese platter and a Tuna (crusted with sesame seeds) steak with pasta. The cheese platter came with 5 different cheeses, 2 toasted crusty bread and salad. It was a good portion for 2 - 4 people. On the other hand, the tuna steak WAS A BOMB! It taste so good. Heads up to the chef for cooking the tuna without burning any of sesame seed that was crusted on the tuna. We had it medium rare. In summary, it is a good place to chill with food and wine. And if you also prefer to feel like you're in a whole different country since most of the patrons are not local
4
There are few places in Singapore where you can have a reasonable meal with wine for 4 people for less than $150, but Wine Connection is up to the challenge. And this value for money aspect is probably why it is always so busy on weekends. We came here last night and had a selection of tapas and a few of the standard dishes, washed down with an ok bottle of French wine. Service was efficient and courteous. No doubt will be back for more
4
We reserved a table and were quickly seated and menus put down. I had to find and stop the waiter to order water, then find and stop the waiter for the wine order, and again, find and stop the waiter to order the food. And, yes, find and stop the waiter for the bill.Other than that, great atmosphere, great food, and good wine selection
4
Always busy, great service. Went there with a big group, sitting at the high tables, which was great. Lots of varied food & drink options, easy to mingle with a big group. Does get very busy!
5
Restaurant extremely busy and not having pre-booked was lucky to get a table. Had excellent meal and great service. Would recommend to others.
4
If you went to the 'wrong' Wine Connection don't feel alone as there are two near identical Wine Connections located just a stone's throw away from each other. Notwithstanding I found the place full of atmosphere on a Tuesday night with hardly a seat left at 8pm. Most were office types looking for a nice watering hole to wind down the evening. Tapas selection was decent while the wine selection extensive. Service was decent and as expected with the ongoing labour crunch faced by most service outlets
4
Managed to get table without booking on a very busy Saturday night . Good atmosphere. Varied menu , tapas and other international western based food available at a very reasonable price. Family had pizza , steaks and other pasta. All arrived promptly and food very good. Service fine and friendly, especially given how busy the place was. Our main server was a trainee but he was well supervised and helped . We enjoyed ourselves and will go bac

This is a best place in Singapore, best service, best food, I came every 2 times per week for the wine n food especially for rideye streaks best in town, the service by the staffs, especially ms Dior was best, can know n remember what a regular customer wants n like n service us with best service, food good, service good, place good, a very good eating n wine plac

Last night and tonight myself and my wife (who is Singaporean) ate at the Robinson Quay restaurant. Having eaten at the restaurant 20+ times I must say sadly that the standards have dropped, last night we received starter and main course within 2 minutes (literally) of each other leaving the main course cold. Tonight similar, the pasta was smaller, with little sauce and less taste. We also had to sit next to some noisy rowdy non-Singaporeans who knocking over chairs, shouting, the restaurant staff responded by giving them more drinks. We spoke with the staff who seems unconcerned. Sadly food standards have dropped
4
Great food and great value - for both food and drinks - Wine Connection was buzzing even on a mid-week evening. That is all due to it probably being one of the best-value restaurants of its ilk in its neighbourhood. For a Singapore F&B outlet, it has a surprisingly large number of wait staff, who are also quite efficient. Service quality is a rarity by Singapore standards (perhaps it gets worse on the weekend, going by many of the reviews here). Avoid the fish dishes and focus on the meats
4
We arrived about 730 pm without reservation and was promptly seated. The place was quite busy already. We ordered a selection of dishes and service was quite quick. Wine was below typical pricing in Singapore restaurant. Dishes were also good value and tasted quite good. We tried their new paella dish which came with a good portfion of chicken meat (4 large pieces), seafood and rice. Pizza was thin crust and very good as well. Cheese plate had a good variety and we enjoyed our evening with good white wine. Will be back
1
April 5, 2015 around 4.30 pm. We were 6 Europen family, practically got sacked from the restaurant by who claimed the manager and the owner of the restaurant. We asked him to combine couple of tables for us, that was too much hassle for him. Then we asked to let us sit the behind empty area which was suppose to be opened at 6 pm for some reason. He basically told us that we were troubling him too much and its better us to leave. I really don't expect a good service in this country but this such insident never happened to me before anywhere in the world. Imagine you want to spend money and they don't care to earn any
3
Our family visited restaurant with some friends. Restaurant wasn't full and it was easy to get a table. Place is full of staff who mostly hang around and wait dishes to be prepared next to kitchen. Food was ok, but I can't say same about the service. In Singapore it is typical to get orders in different time, but now after first order was delivered it took about half an hour for last person to get her dish. It seemed that most of the waiters can either bring food or clear tables. Not very professional. Btw. check your flatware since they might not be clean. Wine is not too expensive, which is of course nice in Singapore. Would I go back? Yes, I will give one more chance for this restaurant to improve.
5
This place is providing really good food. Every dishes are all taste superb. This place is one of the famous restaurant for all Singaporean people like to hang out and you can get any types of wine right at this place
3
Dropped in on a Sunday night, and the place was packed. Ordered some entreès because I couldn't find the tapas menu. Turns out it was in the back of the drinks menu!
None of the food was worth writing about, but the people-watching was fun.
5
About the food is very fantastic and the wines and staff is great.. And all of the food is very delicious and mouth watering..
5
Verynice food and bar, the drinks was nice. And the staff is friendly especially guna.. Very accomodating and the restaurant is recommendable..
3
nice location in Robertson quay, and quiet busy with locals as the prices are very cheap for singapore standard. I found they had many wines but nothing that good hence the price. I actually enjoyed some of the tapas but others were just so so. If the prices were any higher I don't think there would be has many good reviews. The host was friendly , but the servers very morbid and seemed as though didn't want to be there, would probably go back in a group as it would be a cheap option
4
We had our lunch at the HillV2 outlet, various set lunch available from S$15+ onwards, include one main, salad or soup or dessert, coffee or tea. Very nice interior design. Good for private dining as well. We ordered seafood pasta & steak, both were really fresh & yummy. The onion soup & the bread basket were really good. Strongly recommend this place, will come again soon
5
I came here with my cousin and my husband. It has to be one of my favourite places to get fresh food- when you just want something a little bit western. Definitely the best value wine and drinks with a bottle of decent Marlborugh Sav Blanc setting you back $45. We came here twice in three days and both times the service was impeccable. Will definitely return on our next visit. Cannot fault
3
Food was OK, but nothing to wax lyrical about. As you might expect there was a plentiful selection of decent wine. Robertson Walk is a popular place at the weekend and it was good to sit and watch the world wander by for an hour or so
1
I'm a regular at your place but what happened last night is a total turn off for me, besides the food (very cold potato wedges and my favorite pork ribs was not as nice as before ).I was given the wrong credit card when I settled the bill. I did remember to check before i signed the bill and it was really charged under my card but given a wrong credit card.Sometimes mistakes happened so I"m still trying to be understanding but when i did called the outlet i didn't expect that the staff will talk to me unprofessionally, a simple sorry will change everything, but instead he just replied "Oh we are not here last night its not our fault its the night staff on duty's fault etc etc..(too many excuses) so when do u plan to take your card?" after all the trouble that they have caused (not only to me but to the owner of the other card too) no apology as if nothing happened, i can really say that the staffs were not well trained and not courteous enough to handle this kind of situation. Very very disappointed
4
We have been here a number of times now and always come and way happy and feeling we have had value for money and a good time. An extensive wine list from the relatively cheap to extremely expensive variety. A selection of food on the main menu probably good enough to cater for most tastes. The tapas menu has around 20 items which is great for sharing. The food at quieter times comes up quickly, sometimes a little to quick. During the busier times the kitchen seems to keep up and the quality stays steady from dish to dish. Along with the friendly staff and good atmosphere it's a good place to spend and hour or more.
4
returned with Colleagues to the wine connection for Dinner on Wednesday night our waitress Min Excellent service well done you.Our last experience was poor introspect of slow kitchen service. spoke to Min on arrival when placing the orders to explain our experience last time. This time all food arrived together at the relevant intervals the wine was good as ever Deserts were good a good experience all round.. The place is still mad busy so book early to avoid waiting and enjoy some good food at excellent prices & value for money possibly one of the best in Singapore for Quality & Value. please build a bigger kitchen for those talented chefs in there, give them some space to perform keep up the good work & improving... Thank you see you again.
4
Actually, it's 4.5 stars --hard to enter here.A very enjoyable place, lively social scene, good wine list, open spaces, long bar and a varied menu. The service is quick and friendly. The fish, pasta and meat mains are very good and plentiful; so are the salads. Reasonably priced wines too. It does tend to get noisy as it's off the street on one side and quite crowded on the Robertson Walk courtyard side
4
WC TB&B is a great place to hang with friends and family for a great night out.Last week we had at least 15 people at the table outside and service was impeccable.Decided to make a night of it and bought a magnum of wine at a very affordable price.Will definitely go back.D
4
Perfect place to relax and unwind with friends. Varied wine list to cater for the different level of wine enthusiasts. The best aspect of any dining establishment would be the people attending to diners, they are excellent! Friendly and gracious! Thanks very much to Jonalyn and Igor for always making our visit pleasurable! - Pa

Came here with my 4 other friends for our gathering, place was packed but we still got a good table of our preference. Tried around 3 types of their beer, they were very good. For the food, we ordered a platter for 4 and some sides, they were pretty good too. I have requested for a certain lighting to be pointing somewhere else instead to our table, as it was too hot, and they promptly took action, thanks for that. Will come back again

Many restaurants boast and have been blogged about being the top Wine and Food joint in Singapore , However after being a faithful customer for two yrs and exploring all other joints i find this the BEST. Wines: all ranges covered from 35S$ upwards and also they change the bottle if it is not up to your taste as their recommendations are always good. Solid choice of White and red, from yonder be it Chilean, Italian, South African or French for those who don't want to try anything from Down under. Food portions and taste wise is very decent . Service is friendly and accommodating . Thiru has been around for years and is the Best man to have around if you do not know your wine!! Very family oriented and dress code also is unlike other places , truly Wine place with all dressed smart casuals . Expats slowly giving way to many locals who also have found appeal here. Another plus point is the Beers!! best rates and large portions . when in Singapore on Business or leisure this place needs a definite look in. For two people, Bottle of wine and some food, cheese platter salads works around 75 S$ and solid ambience. Avoid crowds on Fridays

After going to wine connection a couple times at Robertson Quay we were disappointed and dismayed by the service and in particular the management in that evening. We both felt let down by the lack of professionalism of the Duty Manager who didn't seem to care whether we liked the food and wine we ordered and processed us like a Maccas. There are other, more genuine places you can spend your money for a good meal in Singapore.

tapas were nice and the price was matching. Wine list could do with a revamp but again pretty good prices for Singapore, it seems to be always busy but I think more of the prices than the service and range. Nice outside area and great for meeting up with friends for a chat
3
Avoid this place,The food we had was very average, and had been precooked and and reheated. The New Zealand Pinot Noir was the worst I have ever tasted and I blame myself as it was one I had not heard of so should have avoided. When we commented on how poor the food was they were not interested and just shrugged and walked away. The wine is cheap for Singapore but when you try them you know why.This is really a bar trying to serve foo

Visited Wine connection Tapas Robertson Quay with Colleagues. Our waiter Joe Excellent service from Joe. The food courses arrived all at different times so we were not able to eat together some brought to the table 30 minutes apart. I would recommend they employ more chefs to cope with the high volume of customers. The food was good when it arrived. Wine was $65 a bottle standard Singapore prices but tasted good Rioja. Disappointed that a service charge 10% was on the bill of $676.50 would have been more than happy to tip Joe direct for his service but the kitchen service was poor. Would I go there again ‘’NO’’ purely because of the kitchen service. I only live 100meters from the Bar pass it daily. The place is packed every night weekends forget it. We Went on a Thursday I would not like to experience the wait for food at a weekend. Great job Jo

Had a lovely dinner, nothing to fault. Great food, great prices fabulous wine, fast friendly service.
Delicious Crab bisque.
Will be back
5
Very nice selection of wines at a reasonable price compared or other places in singapore! Highly recommend for lunch or nibbles
5
This is the most amazing wine bar, the tapas, desserts especially the chocolate lava cake is to die for. then of course the wine list is extensive and well priced. Top it all off with fantastic service and there you have, A must
4
Positive side : Good selection of wines. Reasonably priced considering the outrageously overpricing of wines and liquors in Singapore in hotels, restaurants and shops and supermarkets. Quick and pleasant service.
4
price is reasonable but a bit disappointed when the price hiked a little bit; however, the services are good and when i have asked one of the waitress (Nadia) at cuppage outlet, i've got the nice recommendation, it's nice when someone can recommend good wine
3
wines are decently priced which is a HUGE plus for Singapore; food is decent, but nothing spectacular; but then again prices are reasonable; probably best suited for a casual drink and some tapas with friends. service is attentive, borderline pushy sometimesnot ideal for a formal business meal or a romantic even
4
Wine connection has well priced wines and beers, decent tapas at a great Robertson Quay location. I am particularly fond of the Memminger Premium Pilsner - a German beer that tastes great in the Singapore warmth. Quite like the Stella Bella Australia Shiraz blend as well
4
Went for a glass of wine and stayed for cheese platter dinner. Cheese selection and quality was very good and we enjoyed our wine as well. We actually visited the sister-restaurant Wine Connection Cheese. Service was very good, atmosphere was nice but the location is too busy as next to Condo and Taxi rank. Overall a nice dinner
4
You don't need to be a wine lover to like the place as they serve a great variety for all tastes. Even living in Singapore i was quite surprised to be here first time and i love the concept of this resto-bar. Great food variety at very reasonable prices and as well a great variety on different drinks.... Well stocked on beers and a huge wine list including attached wine shop... Really a place you must go 
4
Been there many times with family and friends and used to enjoy the lamb cutlet which was a main draw for many of us, among other things. The recent menu change has completely omitted this dish and we wonder why. I am sure statistics would show it is a favorite dish as on some occasions, the kitchen ran out of lamb quite early. Hello Chef?! Been mainly to the Robertson Walk outlet, and service-wise this is one of the best places in town, with both senior and new staff all friendly and helpful. Keep it up
4
Had a quick dinner here with a work colleague. It seemed to be the busiest restaurant which we took as a good sign. The food was affordable and the service was cheerful, if a bit slow. The menu is a bit limited.
4
Great selection of cheeses, cold cuts and wines. Very good value for money, especially the wine given the typically high prices in Singapore. Highly recommended.
4
Enjoyed our last evening in Singapore here. The wine was perfectly matched to our food and the ambience of the evening was great. Ensure you try the wine menu
5
good and affordable selection of wine. Nice tapas and lovely cheese spread.
Advance booking is recommended as it is a popular local joint and can be hard to get a table if you have no bookings.
4
Great location, outside terrace, regular menu and tapas menu offered! Singapore offeres expensive menus but Wine connection is great value for money! Too bad they close a little bit too early at night when you are ready to keep eating and drinking with friends!
5
Great place to hang out at night!! I like this the comfortable environment.
Lava cake is tasty! But the drinks is just so but worthwhile the value of place.
1
The chef is totally inflexible to accommodate to people with diet restriction. It's definitely not friendly restaurant that care about customers. Maybe their business is too good to bother about minority. I rather go for places that are willing to make exceptions for people who are allergic to some food
5
Excellent value for money, good drinkable wine & a lovely cheese and meat plater. Was seated outside in the original outlet which I think is nicer than the new large mainly indoor place close by. It was very busy but the staff were excellent ... Working hard to find us a table and then with their recommendations and ongoing service
4
Great venue, good food and drinks. Attentive staff - Tinesh. Very professional, polite and great smile. I remembered he attended to my friends and I some time ago. Always a pleasant experience.The only complain I have - the phone keeps on ringing but very difficult to get through for reservation. Tried calling from 3pm to 5pm, I decided to try walking in instead
1
tried to arrange a group christmas dinner at wine connection, only to be treated like beggars when I asked about the menu, I was told to take or leave. When I requested to discuss over the phone, "I am on the road, email me". When I called the restaurant to find out more, they requested a physical visit down the branch at roberton quay and upon reaching, I was told it is not possible to discuss face to face and everything can only be done over email. er then why asked me to make a trip down? In addition, I was told food & drinks will be served what the kitchen deemed fit on that day itself. I wonder am I the customer or Wine ConnectionManagement is the customer? Totally ruined my impression of wine connection
5
With friends Al fresco dining with a bottle of wine and great service. perfect evening to end the day
The rest of the text is make the 100

Awsome restaurant great service and very friendly superb food for s great price best restaurant by far in Robertsons Walk. If possible get waiter called Sam very friendly and helpful. Wish we had found on first night of holiday in Singapore

We used to go to the Wine Connection whilst living in Singapore, at that time it was a small place but always had a good atmosphere. Now it has expanded so much, in some respects I think it may become a victim of over expansion. I agree with all the reviews, it's a great place to meet up with friends, wine is great and so well priced. However at our visit last week, the starter we were served should not have left the kitchen, we were not charged for it. The service needs to be streamlined, the staff were like headless chickens coming out with bits and pieces of orders for various tables. None of the staff looked as though they enjoyed working there, it should be fun! Also one other point, I personally feel that a restaurant of this size should have their own washrooms. Having to go upstairs to use the shared facilities is far from ideal, especially as there was no hand towels or soap on my visit
4
I visit here every visit to Singapore. Good wine and great cheese for a realistic price. The people are great and the service excellent. Well positioned to many good hotels and the quay. One issue is the difficulty in getting a taxi after 10pm but that isn't unique to here. Fully recommend and look for me - I'll be back there soon

On the 19th of October 2014, I visited wine connection as I was recommended that it was a good restaurant to have a great meal and good night life after program. Shawn was the one who approached us very politely, really showing the best of quality unlike any other service provider of any other casual dining places.While I was having a hard time to select which food or beverage to order for my dinner, Wilson noticed and came over and recommended what would be nice on the menu as it was our first time there. He also gave several recommendations based on his own experience of trying out the Sirloin in Wine Connection. Shawn then played a part in recommending the wine to end off our night.While we were there, both Wilson and Shawn were very friendly and approached us several times, asking us how did we find the food and wine. Also talking to us at a level which made us feel very comfortable.All I can say for this trip is that, I strongly feel the service providers at Wine Connection aint just any normal waiters or server, they have really good service that will really make your dining experience there the most enjoyable to the max. Thanks for reading! =
4
I visit Wine Connection every time I go to Singapore. It is by far the best value for money on food and wine. Atmosphere is great and it's always buzzy.Sometimes the service is a little slow, but this is the one place in Singapore that it's forgivable.Visit and enjoy a very reasonable and varied wine list!
3
I'm there right now in a Saturday night,Dj siva is amazing with his hip hop music putting everybody in the mood.But:-our table was too dark and we could not see our food-Order was wrong we were punched a wine glass we never had-Roster chicken was full of bones (imagine in the dark)-Waiter charged 97$ instead of 79...had to wait for the correction My food was fine and portion was ok.Overall food ok.Ambiance on a Saturday night is AmazingWaiter needs training and organisation.
5
Probably the best value you can get in Singapore. I've been here over 7 times now and it's still great.Pros:+ Affordable wine list, good wines from SDG 35 per bottle (i.e. very cheap for Singapore norms)+ Take a few tapas first, and then the tenderloin with red wine sauce (really good!)Cons:- Bit noisy at the end of the evenin
5
Really happy with the service your stuff miss Meena given to us,she friendly,helpful,and the best of all is she smile all the way even though is really busy and I can see it from her eyes she's stress but manage to serve us well! From the moment we walk in,miss meena greet us(which I'm sorry to say but very less of your stuff will do that)once we are done with our meal, she ask if she could help to clear the plate for us and we were shock, because usually your other stuff would just clear it without asking or anything.shes really provide a good service! Really happy coming down last night to dine in. I'm hoping to get this kind of service again
5
We visited this place after being refused by another restaurant as they were not open for lunch. Obviously not the first choice for Italian food however we enjoyed the taste of real good Italian food served with a request of keeping it completely veg.Nice ambiance, good food and great service.I suggest one must explore this place:
3
This place is always packed. Good tapas, ho hum paella, hit and miss steaks. A great atmosphere with all the crowds.
5
The pizzas and tapas are surprisingly cheap for Singapore, and tasted great. Great choice of wine and beer, so a good location for a dinner with friends. We'll definitely be back with more friends.
5
Loved the vibe of this place inside - great classy décor. Wine list was excellent - some good international options. The cheese pizza was also great. Highly recommended for a late drink and bite.
4
I'm one who loves a good wine at most meals. Choosing a venue for my birthday dinner with friends is always a long drawn process with different preferences from each person (especially so for all girls!). Wine connection was a good choice where wine is affordable and options for food ranges from tapas for our small eaters to main courses and pizzas for the rest of us. We enjoyed ourselves. It can get very crowded at night though so it's best to reserve early
4
We went to a Wine Collection a couple of times in a week! Singapore is renowned for being expensive for wine, however the wine collection is an exception to that. They have a very good selection to suit all pockets, we found the food to be well cooked and presented. The place is always busy so don't expect fast food. Will visit again next time we are in Singapore.

Visited just after our GP wkend and thought a lovely lunch with my daughter would be a nice end to a good weekend.Arrived at 12:05 and eventually after 20 minutes I was informed while I was looking at the tapas menu that the server had handed me that tapas was not available till after 4?? After her walked away and not ssking if I wanted a drink while I peruse the menu!!!! After another 15 mins I managed to catch attention of the waiters who wre all so busy chatting away in the doorway to ask if it wouldn't be to much inconvenience for me to have some water and order food after 40 minutes and nobody coming near me..he then said he thought i was waiting on other guests... I had on entree ring asked for a table for TWO and whilst that may have been the case of mistaken on how many people, were sitting at my table I informed him that leaving a customer for close to 40 minutes without even asking if they'd like a drink was not the way to win customers.. The food my daugher ordered was adequate, I wanted tapas so didn't eat. How you can have a restaurant called a tapas bar and not serve tapas all day for me is mind boggling, call yourself a restaurant and then offer tapas menu as an extra after 4... Won't be rushing back.. Shame reall
5
We had our company event at Wine Connection on September 21st 2014. Danny and the rest of the staff really took great care of us. The food was served fresh and the portions were quite generous considering it was tapas; the wine was affordable and of great quality! Not to mention the service is certainly of the highest standard, especially for Singapore where there are so many F&B options to hold company events. I highly recommend Wine Connection for any company event or group occasion. 5 stars! Christia
5
Spent a celebratory evening at Wine Connection with 70 or so colleagues enjoying some social time together. We had a great time. The Tapas are exceptional and those small plates keep you coming back for more and more. The serving staff are extremely well trained and quietly mingled with the group, topping up drinks, bringing out food etc without causing a ripple. I'd highly recommend this as a great place for both a small group and a large crowd
5
Wine Connection never fails my expectation every visit. First, the place has a nice ambiance and the crowd is just great. So, if I want to chill after a hard days work or to have a few drinks on a weekend or to celebrate special occasions, it is always the perfect place for me.They offer great food at competitive prices and the wine selections are extensive. The service is impeccable. The staff ensures that we are being attended to. I recall Girlie willingly explains and suggests the best wine pairings everytime we ask her to. Never did we feel that she feels obligated to do it.I had recommended this gem to my friends and will continue to do so... :
5
I have been a regular at Wine connection for 3 years. The ambience is great in here -we love to sit outdoor facing the courtyard where our 3 kids could scooter around and not be bored by our long dinner and drinks....Tapas is a great value here in the most expensive city in the world !I like to commend on staff Guna. I think he has served our table many times the last three years . He has been attentive and most importantly , positive with a bright smile - a scarce attribute in the labour-shortage city of Singapore ! ( Singapore is not known for fun -loving friendly service culture , hence Guna who has constantly deliver such refreshing service , draws us back again and agin ! ) thanks !!
4
Great ambiance, good wine collection and good pizza's. The place is a good place for an end of the day office gatherings and to host business clients.
5
great food..great wine..great service. at very reasonable prices. Thank you to Zach, Guna, and most especially Girlie for making us feel special while dining and wining. Don't miss it in Singapore! Rudolf & Chona

The Wine Connection Singapore is a great place to relax and enjoy quality Mediterranean food and a good bottle of wine at reasonable prices. It is away from the more hectic Singapore locations and offers dining inside or outside in an al fresco environment.

I brought a few colleagues here after hearing their fantastic wine prices from friends. We made a reservation at 8PM and reached slightly earlier. We were shown to our table immediately.Fast taking of orders and delivery of food, though the service is somewhat bad. A non-local male waiter was rude to a female colleague of mine, maybe he couldn't understand what she was asking him but nevertheless.. Front-line service crew should never be rude under any circumstances.There was a DJ playing as well but we did not enjoy the music. I feel that a bar / restaurant should have a strict music policy, where the music is accommodating to the customers' conversations. It should be complementary and not intrusive to the ambiance.Prices were reasonable, food for four people came up to about $200 including two bottles of wine. Will definitely be back here for more wine. Affordable and wide-range of wines
5
That was our second time with my family in wine connection. This time I cant wait to write a review with this awesome restaurant. We were well taken care of with their approachable and friendly staffs specially Girlie and Jhonalyn. The quality of the food and the wine, I'll say it's SUPERB!!! I will definitely bring my family and friends here again and again. Great for bonding!!
5
This is our favorite place to hangout. The food is good and the wine is very affordable. But most importantly, the service from the staff is exceptional. Especially Guna who never fails to greet us and bring us to our favorite seats at the bar-counter each time we were there
5
First time trying there after reading so many good reviews,and it's really worth it! Service was really good,very friendly staff. especially, the manager Zack was really helpful. We were warmly welcomed when we entered the restaurant, and shown to our table by him. Food was excellent, as were the wine recommendations. I'm generally not a fan of Italian wines, but the ones we had there were pretty decent.Definitely will come back again!Good job! Will recommend it to others
5
Wine connection is a good place to hold gatherings. We had a group of 35 people and the service was excellent, especially from Thiru and Guna, who helped to coordinate. The drinks and food came promptly and were affordable. All the staff were friendly and eager to attend to our needs very readily. Overall, our guests enjoyed themselves and we look forward to enjoy the great service from Wine Connection again
5
Wine Connection was the last resort that came to my mind to hold a small cozy dinner for my guest after signing my Registry of Marriage but it was the best decision I had taken to celebrate my happy occasion and ending the night with loads of laugher and good feelings.The Customer Service was excellent and the staffs were so accomodating in letting us taking good pictures in the restaurant and at our own time as they moved around us still doing their job .Music was so nice as a backdrop and soothing as my guest were chatting away still enjoying to the music. Good job to Chris Colombus and the DJ's involved.Under the watchful eyes of Mr Sara, the Manager of the Restaurant, food came on time and a reasonable huge portion . I would like to thank him for his hospitality and his way of handling the small huge group of my guest. He personally took note of who are vegetarians and served accordingly.The young from age 3 to seniors who are in their 60's enjoyed the ambience and food and left with good memories.My husband and i decided to come back again for our date nights and wedding anniversary. I, believe that says it all on my experience at Wine Connection.Keep it up Wine C
4
An affordable place to buy a bottle of wine and chat around with tid-bits. Highly recommend this place for birthday celebrations as it doesn't hurt your pocket much. Food is cheap and good. Service: 10 on 10. We went there for a birthday celebration and 'Edmund' took care of our table consisting over 12 people and he was amazing in the same.P.S.: This place is not only for Wine lovers
5
The review I am writing of fo Wine Connection the main restaurant in Robertson Walk. Meat and pizzas are quite good and the prices are very affordable, I would say in the range between 35 and 60 Singapore Dollars. I definitely recommend this place.
5
Excellent and quick service. Reasonably priced and the food is tasty...and Edmund rocks! We'll definitely be back for more.
5
Wine Connection is a must-try resto for superb dining experience. Quality dishes, amazing wines and drinks, not to mention wide array of selection and affordability, one you shouldn't give a miss. Customer service, friendliness, and responsiveness adds value to the whole experience. Example is one if their staff, Girlie. She's attentive to the needs of the guests. Go visit and dine-out now
5
This place I would definitely recommend to friends, colleagues and even families who want to enjoy and have fun together while having a variety of wine selections. Food was good at reasonable prices, overall service was great and the ambience was perfect. The staff were very accommodating especially Girlie, who made sure we were well taken care of. Keep it up, WC
5
We've been to wine connection few times together with my friends. Last weekend we randomly visited after our dinner for a drink. While waiting for our table we checked at their cocktails and food menu the prices were reasonable. I remember someone name Girlie lead us to our table with her smiling face. She helped us in choosing good wine and made us familiar with it. We will definitely come back soon
5
As the title of my review says, Wine Connection Tapas Bar & Bistro has been truly AMAZING each time i've been there. It started off with a date, and i fell in love.. with the Moscato di Asti! Every other occasion, casual meet up with friends and celebratory dinners, the first place that comes to my mind in Wine C. The drinks and food taste excellent and they are rather affordable. Therefore, you can have a huge party without having to worry much about the bill :) The service is commendable. Having been in the F&B industry, i truly appreciate service staff greeting us with a beautiful smile and creating small conversations with us. Shoutout to Mr. Sara (manager) for his very friendly service and attending to our requests despite it being full house. 5 stars for the great ambience! On top of the affordable prices, friendly staff and service in a fabulous looking place, comes the music that makes the whole experience even more memorable. I've been to Wine C several times and even the DJs are so friendly! Kudos to Mr Chris Columbus and his group of DJs who are spicing up the place with their good choice of songs! To the whole team of Wine C, keep up the tremendous work! Definitely will be back for more
5
I have to say Edmund and Royston are really friendly and nice with excellent service provided. But the brownie that I used to order is no longer avaiable nowadays and special requested is not accpetted now. (requestes to be spicy) Do make reservation before u come cos its just too popular
4
I have been to Wine Connection for few times, the experience I had was just awesome. I love the tapas and Kilawil DJ are extraordinary. In addition, While I sit at the bar, 2 people express their wishes and welcome me everytime. I think WC success is resides on such people who care about customer. In times, they even remind me that I have drunk and better for me to leave. It's a good initiative. My appreciation goes to Sukumar(Bar) and Saravanan. Keep up the good work and tapas secret is always yours :) Cheers,Vinod

I had some Wine and Cheese here with some friends. Actually it´s a nice location to have some appetizer and Wine. The price is ok for Singapore but actually they could give you a little bit more food for this price. The cheese was really a small piece.First of all I could not believe that my red wine was cold. But for this weather conditions I was a kind of happy to get a cold wine :
1
We have eaten here often. As a couple, and large groups. The first few times were great....good wine, good food, quirky variety with good atmosphere.However, our recent experience was exceedingly average.We ordered a beautiful wine....and it was.We shared a starter...all good.We ordered a main each.....that's where the fun began! Lamb shank, and a med-rare steak. Too easy I hear you say? Mmmm! Should have realised there was a problem when my husband was given a steak knife.....So, my steak arrived.....I sat and looked at it, trying to be polite and await my husbands meal. 10 mins later it hadn't come, and I started my meal before it was too cold....that's the first bad...On cutting my steak, it was still bleeding...I call that blue, not med-rare.We caught a waiters attention, asking where my husbands meal was....waiter had not even ordered it! Also, told him my steak was way under cooked....was then told that what they had given WAS med-rare. Mmm! 48 yr old steak eater....have had a few before...and they never Moooed like this one! Sent it back....yes, in 2 pieces as I had cut it in half...Lamb arrived quickly, and was lovely. Then, the same 2 pieces of my steak ( really? Most restaurants would give a new piece!!!!) arrived back.....they had quick-seared the raw edges, and, YES it was STILL rare!!!!!Top it off, they didn't bring me any cutlery....I went to up to the till to express my dissatisfaction...no cutlery, still raw.... Said they could cook it a bit more.... Was over it by then so just ate the wedges.When we went to pay, they were trying to charge for the uneaten steak! Refused to pay. At last we got to speak to a manager. He apologised for the bad service etc. said he would sort something out....he returned with the rare steak in a takeaway bag!!!! Was raw in the restaurant, wasn't going to be cooked by taking it home!!!At last, they seemed to get it. Took the steak & 10 percent off the bill.We had recommended this restaurant to at least 12 different people because previous visits were superb. Big let down. Will try one more time...

I come here every month to meet my Danish friends. Food is ok, wine list is good but the atmosphere is great.
Very nice place to meet and have fun.
5
A nice place to get drinks with your buddies after work. Great service from the staff at the bar; they are friendly and have good expertise for the wines
3
Wine is cheap and $5 tapas that's the only reason this place is busy. Service is terrible. Not real tapas, but some were nice and others just ok. I'd suggest a place to meet for a bottle of wine.
5
Is my first time been wineconection tapas bar .good value and fun place especially the kindly staff I'm not sure the name Wilson or winson he's really nice guy gave us good experience. I think we will come here often and become a regular guest 
5
Had dinner with one of my business contacts and decided to try Wine Connection out after hearing many positive comments about it. What happened delighted both by contact (whom is a F&B business owner in Malaysia himself) and I. The ambience was warm and cosy, service of the staff excellent and very attentive ! and the food was perfect... pastas and pizzas the way it should be (at an affordable $12-16 range)... and of course the wines were great (lovely tasting up and coming labels at very affordable prices) ... as compared to most places where a plate of good pasta will set you back at least $25++ or more. One thing is for sure. I will be returning for more
4
A place on top of the mind when you want to hang out with friends/colleagues after a long day at work!Supered range of wine from over the world at AFFORDABLE price for bottles.What makes this memorable was the excellent service from SENTHIL (Supervisor). He was patient, attentive and has great knowledge of the wine; serving the guest on a busy night with a SMILE always on his face! Great job Senthil

Have been to this place before but the last time we were unceremoniously booted off an apparently unreserved outdoor table, by exceedingly arrogant staff, since the management were obviously looking to accommodate their cronies over mere mortals like us. In future, I will be assisting them in their strategy of keeping their tables free for their preferred customers by never setting foot in the place again. I would say more but TripAdvisor rules...
1
Myself and a group of friends attended this wine bar Friday evening and sat outside at a table with no reservation sign on it. Before we had the chance to order our drinks or meals a rude waitress followed by a group of patrons told us to leave the table as the group were transferring from an inside table. We were shocked and said there were other vacant outside tables, but we were told again to leave as the guests had requested our table. There was no please or apology, just arrogance. Obviously at this place, it's who you know, not what you know. How rude !! We will never go here again
4
It was my first time here, and I came here with my group of friends to celebrate my friend's birthday. As my friend drinks, so one of them introduce this place! I would say that the place is slightly inaccessible for those that doesn't drives, as it isn't very near the bus stop or mrt.The place generally has nice ambience and decorations, feels quite cosy too! There are like outdoor seats (non air-con) and indoor seats (air-con) For the wine that we drank (don't know what's the names), it was quite nice too - sweet type. I also feel that the wines there are quite value for money as compared to other places.I feel that for people who like wines, they can come here to give it a try. I definitely won't wine coming here again
5
Visited the bar rather late at night. The wines offered were of a huge variety and were mostly affordable.Music played in the place was a tad too loud, however, the service standard was top-notched. Just like a top-class restaurant or bar, they will politely ask the customers to taste the wine they have ordered first. Despite the early closing hours even on a Friday night, the waiters set up outdoor seating areas for all the customers indoors so that they could keep their chairs and tables back into their store instead of just chasing them away
5
Good food, affordable price, best serving staff. Good Dinner n drink place. couldn't find fault with them.
4
Celebrated my friend's birthday at wine connection. Good food and wine. Reasonable prices as well. Will definitely return again and will recommend to my other friends.
5
Being a regular customer at WC in the past, I must say that the level of service for WC TB&B has met beyond my expectations! Not only the wine and food are affordable, the service was amazing in addition to the awesome setting of the restaurant. It was my first visit the bistro and has made my experience very memorable. The staff deserves a pat on their back for being so attentive, welcoming and for providing exceptional service. Thank you WC! Please keep it up
4
Ate here again tonight, for probably about the 12th time in the past year and once again, the service and the food was really good. Only once have we not been happy with our experience here and that was on a Sunday afternoon when the tapas menu was not available and the service was average. Tonight, the service was extremely efficient and the food really good and exceptional value for money
5
the tapas is pretty good, and value for money at $5 a plate. The main courses are pretty good too. Wine is sourced directly from producers and this probably helps WC keep prices down. Ambience is great, and they are never short of service staff so you tend to get sufficient attention. Overall experience has always been great, and this has become a regular watering hole. Danny and his crew have done a brat job building this up over the last few years. Well done

I firstly order white wine and it was too dry. And the server is willing to change my white wine into another better selection with additional cost which is not much. I'm sooooo happy the flexibility!!! Incredible !!!My cheese platter is flawless and so is my Chicken Breast with BBQ sauce.I had a perfect dinner with my colleagues during this business trip at this place.Totally recommended !!!Oh and the staffs are super friendly as well!!!Well done ;

I had dinner at Wine connection - I like the place; the decoration is very modern and cosy, the atmosphere is nice. There are 2 large terraces if you prefer to seat outside. Of course you'll probably have to queue before having a table, but it is quiet quick.Food was great, wine was good, and price are very correct ! It is not really a "local place" but it looks like the favorite place of expats !FYI, we had 1 pealla (shared - it is big), one tapas, one beer and we paid around 60$.The service was not very well organized but we were not in a hurry.We will definitively come back to this place 
4
A cozy restaurant in a nice area of Singapore. Walking distance to the river ferry.The tapas was a bit tired and not the best, but still not bad. The service and feeling of the place was great! A great place to go for a drink as well
4
I really like this place, and usually I get a good service too - but this visit was really bad service-wise. My soup was almost thrown in front of me, the bowl being covered in soup on the outside, and the cook/waiter with his hands all over it not using a tray. The order wasn't complete, so we had to reorder - just to hear and see two waiter arguing who should go to the kitchen and who should open our wine!!! Hm, I'll definitly go there again, but I hope there will be a better atmosphere next time. Food is really nice, and their wine very affordable

Went there to celebrate my girlfriend's birthday with a group of friends on sat night in May. We have 2 bottles of Richland Pink Moscato, three different kinds of pizza, cold cuts and cheese platter. We have also requested a chocolate lava as a surprise cake for my girlfriend's birthday. They gave it to us as a compliments. However, one of the waiters was not very tactful as he put a dessert spoon on her table....Gosh...you can imagine the rest of the scene.....Afterall, we had a good time there. I think every Fri and Sat are very crowded and somehow short of staff during peak hours. Service is acceptable
5
Have been here for twice and the experiences are both great. The food and wine are very nice here and the ambiance's wonderful.
5
Went there one sat afternoon with my 2 kids and friends . Staff was attentive n polite , constantly refilling our water glasses . Food was really gd ! Had the pizza n fish n chips !
4
Good place, good wine, good food, good service.
Have to go at least once.
Order their foie gras in skewer; its only SGD5 & it is delicious
4
I know wine connection when holiday in Thailand. Lots of them all over the country. Widest range of wine selection. Beer too.We stayed at Park Hotel next door. Convenient for us come here often. Cold cuts $15 and cheese platter $15 here is cheaper than the Wine Connection Cheese Bar. I'll let the photo do the talking. Cheese bar 3 item cost $19. Cold cuts at tapas bar come with pate too. Sunday night was very busy. Service was still top notch. Shame Pitbull tunes was played all night long. Scruffy punters standing on chair shouting.Second evening (Monday)come again. Totally like heading to a different restaurant. Much decent lounge music. Corn fed spring chicken was gorgeous.It is very warm dining inside the bistro. Open plan kitchen. Need some fans to keep the air flowing
4
One of the best wine places in Singapore. The vibe of the place is great and the service is top notch. A wide range of wines of different price ranges to choose from. Food selection is good and tastes good too. Wine Connection has made their wines and food so affordable, its hard not to come back again and again. Be prepared to queue especially after working hours
5
Recently spent an evening at Wine Connection on Robertson Walk. It was recommended to me by friends as a well priced wine bar with great food. Actually, it more than exceeded my expectations. We started with a prosecco perhaps could have been more chilled then a lovely South African sauvignon blanc. We ate some great tapas and then went on to salads - smoked salmon salad on a generous portion of salad leaves with perfect deressing and copious amounts of bread - fantastic! Our waiter was also attentive and friendly and made us all feel very welcome. Great atmosphere - perhaps music could be turned down a little but all in all a wonderful restaurant and wine bar and I will definitely be back
4
It's unusual to find a place in Singapore where you can buy a decent bottle of wine for just $40, and have some reasonably priced tapas to go with it. This place is always crowded late into the night on Friday and Saturday evenings. Good selection of well-priced wine. Beer selection is more limited but also reasonably priced by Singapore standards. Worth a visit
1
This wasn't good. the place was not fully occupied on Thursday night. We saw a couple of table outside and we requested a table outside at about 11pm. but "NO" said the server. That table will be taken up later.Mind you its already 11pm! After 15mins the table is still empty!Oh well - don't set HIGH expectations
5
This is a great place for a group party. We had about 40 people for dinner and drinks on a Saturday night and it was the perfect choice with good value and great service. We were on the outdoor courtyard facing the terrace which had a nice atmosphere but still keeping us separate from the rest of the diners. The service was attentive with the beer and wine continually flowing and there was a good selection of tapas and pizzas being served. The only thing I would suggest is to have a couple of standing fans to give some breeze because it got quite hot as the night went on. Special thanks to Senthil and Igor who really took care of us! We will definitely go back
4
This is a great pace for good wine that is very reasonable in term of price. The food is nice, with an extensive choice on the menu. The music was brilliant, but maybe a bit loud if you want a good old chit chat! Make a booking, as it gets very busy
5
we had been in singapore 6 nights and had mixed restaurant experiances.we stumbled on to wine connection.absolutely the best.service top notch and also great value.cheapest wine prices in the area.so good that we intend to eat here for the rest of our stay
5
One of our favourite bars at Robertson quay. Tapas is priced at $5 and bottled wine from $50. Good for late night drinks and food if you are around the area.
4
Another awesome place to hang with friends or business meetings.Their Tapas selection is great, followed by something of 300 wines and full menu...TIP try the Paella or Meat Lover Platter!!! A stylish and sophisticated setting, great music and atmosphere made our evening there unforgettable. A bummer is the waiting if you couldn't make a reservation on time.... we had to wait about 30min for a table on a Thursday night.Service is also attentive and quick. We will be back for sure!

I threw a party for 20 odd people at the Tapas Bar one Saturday evening. We had booked the centre long table that was sandwiched between the 2 service counters. Even though we were standing for most part of the evening and blocking the way whilst dancing the waiters were cooperative. The food and wine here are very competitively priced and certainly value for money. They don't compromise on quality because of lower prices. The food was served rather fast even though we ordered for 20 people after reaching the restaurant. The service was quite efficient and we had one lady, Aini, assigned solely for us the whole evening, whilst others helped her along the way. My only grouse - and part of it is my fault too - was that the bill had several items that we had neither ordered nor consumed. In fact as the party wound down with a few people leaving, we gave up one part of the table to other guests who were standing by the bar; I had clearly drawn this to Aini's attn that she shouldn't be adding their orders to our bill. Finally when the bill arrived, it was nearly 1am (and we had been there from 7 as that is the last reservation allowed) and I signed without going through each item line-by-line. Next morning when I returned to my senses I saw we were charged 15 bottles of wine + a few glasses, that works to 1 bottle per person plus there were several other beverages and food items that nobody on our table had consumed because all the food order went through me. Clearly my fault that I didn't check the bill before signing. So when I went back to the restaurant to sort things out, I was immediately taken into their wine bar where I was offered 1 bottle of wine as a compromise and a promise to waive of next times bill; but they didn't offer any refund or credit notes saying that the bill was already cleared and that they didn't have a concept of issuing credit notes.So if you are going in a big group or hosting a party here, please check your bill before leaving, don't make the mistake that I made
2
Tuesday 13th May, First impressions looks neat, nice welcome and pleasant ambiance.Then it went down hill. The 2 meals came 15 mins apart. and despite being 15 mins late the pasta was undercooked. The couple at the next table also had the same issue.Staff dis-interested (poorly trained?). 4 times I requested the bill, this they would not bring until I had filled out a comments form. Even then, I still had to ask twice for my change. By Singapore standards very poor service. We have enjoyed better food, service and prices else where at Robertson Quay. Overall impression was that it has sufficient turn over of tourists/punters not to care. And please note I'm being polite, the better half is still spitting feathers..
5
Excellent ambiance despite restaurant being rather largeBroad choice of Tapas and main coursesAttractive wine list (parent company)Pleasant vibrant location @ Robertson QuayPortions are of good size and food is of very good quality while being authenticVery good value for moneyIndoor and alfresco choic
4
Great concept: very good food and great wines for relatively low prices.We started with Spanish tapas (chicken, prawns, and bruschetta with parma), all good. The best was the main course: a tenderloin medium-rear with red wine sauce - it was very tender and big, superbly prepared. As a dessert we had the chocolate, which was good but was not freshly prepared.We'll be visiting more often
4
I've been here a few times, and I'll definitely visit again. They have an amazing wine list that is very reasonably priced, with enough variety to please all palettes. However, not all their staff are conversant with the wines, so it's up to you to go with your best guess, particularly if you're stuck with having to choose between a couple of options. The food is pretty good too, though a few more vegetarian options would be wonderful. The menu for vegetarians is very limited
5
We found this restaurant 2 years ago, and have been consistent patrons ever since. We've visited both the main restaurant and the wine and cheese bar, and have also bought bottles of wine to go.The food is terrific - great quality and price, and there's a great selection of very reasonably priced wines both to drink in and take away. While the food and wine definitely are a draw, there are lots of great places to eat in Singapore. What really keeps us coming back is the great customer service. We've had very good experiences with all of the wait staff at this location, but a stand out to us is a server named Riki. She's always got a great smile for us, is very attentive without being intrusive, and knows the menu backwards and forwards. Riki has definitely made The Wine Connection, Robertson Walk our "go to" restaurant
5
This is my favorite place to get together with friends for dinner and drinks. We especially like to sit at the big terrace in the back of the restaurant. The food is yummy and the drink selection is great. The ambiance is just right with a good mix of people and the service is very fast and friendly. In addition it's surprisingly affordable. It's almost a pleasure to ask for the bill there, haha. I seriously don't know of any other place in Singapore with such an overall great value for money. You should really give it a try. I especially like the Grilled Veggi Salad and the Mushroom Risotto but also the pizzas are nice to snack on. Enjoy:
5
First of all,
I was impressed with the wine list.Fantastic selection.
Food was really good.Delicious.
A wonderful place to chill out after work!
5
Don't be put off by a queue outside - this underlines how good this tapas place is. The queue moves quickly as the food is served promptly. The wine list is also great. Highly recommended.
5
This place is a real find. The service is good and prompt and the food is very good. Love their meat lovers platter and their cheese platter but they have many nice items. And the wine is good and super cheap for Singapore. Highly recommended.
4
Good quality food and wine , great service and reasonable pricing. On top of these, great vibe and atmosphere on weekends as well.
A bottle of sparkling white wine is less than $40!
The Parma Ham with rock melon is great as well.
3
Good place for casual dining with friends. Can get quite busy.
Good selection of wine at v reasonable prices. We had a very generous rocket salad and various tapas to share. Liked the baked mussels and the sausages. Pleasant meal overall.
5
My girlfriend and i visited this place last night, looks like a small bar from outside but was like a tardis with two outside terraces too. The wine starts at just 30s$ a bottle an absolute bargain by Singapore standards and a huge selection. We arrived at 7.45 and the place was full with a really good vibe. We had 5 tapas dishes all of which were as good as ive eaten in Spain, and also a pasta dish which was excellent. All in all well worth a visit
4
I was visiting with a few friends and had great tasting tapas and a cheese plate. The service was good and the waiter constantly followed up with drinks, water and asked if all was good. The Tapas was tasty and so was the cheese plate. Good selection of beer and wine as well and the prices was really good compared to the quality food, service and location we were getting. Worth to visit
5
Hands-down the cheapest tapas place Iâ€™ve found in Singapore so far. The tapas available in other restaurants or bars cost not an arm or leg but maybe a few fingers and are definitely not worth it. For a place that is done up as well as this (modern, sleek classy interior), its prices were surprising. Ok and of course the wines were terrific-ly affordable too
3
went there with friends on a friday night, very packed with customers with tables placed very closed to each other, food took about half an hour to arrive so gets to enjoy the wines first. Great place for gathering with friends but not recommended for couples looking for peace and privacy
4
We went for dinner. The vegetarian Paella was excellent - worth waiting the 30-40 minutes for - even the kids liked it. The gourmet pizzas were good too. The outside seating on the barrels is interesting. Went another time for brunch - the place was empty, and the service was still slow - weird
5
Great atmosphere...good collection of wine at decent prices
overall good place to chill with friends!
4
Good peoples, good foods, good wines and reasonable price, what is this! Cheer for another good year.
5
After 3 weeks of vacation in Bali, what a Nice adress to go back to european civilisation ... Nice to have some amazing Wine. The food and the staff where so Nice.
Next Time in singapore, we Will go back the.
5
Good atmosphere, nice spot in the little square. The beer was ok, but we had just arrived from Munich so had been a little spoiled for taste. Nice tapas, ribs and salad. The desert was a little disappointing.
4
We buy a lot of our wine from the Wine Connection shop in Bukit Timah, which is how we came to know about this restaurant. We've visited a few times, usually over lunch and I'll be honest and say that the main appeal, for us, is the keen pricing of the wine. There is no greedy markup here, as is so often the case, and particularly hard to swallow in Singapore where wine straight off the shelf is already pretty expensive. I think this may even be the only restaurant we have ever visited where our food bill was more than the cost of the wine!The food is fine, with family friendly choices, as reflected in the clientele, especially at the weekend. It can get pretty busy, but then again, it is a huge space, so they are unlikely to run out of room. There are good value set lunches, a range of salads and pizzas, fish and meat dishes, as well as tapas later in the afternoon, which we have not yet sampled. If I wanted to eat great pizza, this would not be my first choice in Singapore, but if I was thinking simple lunch with a decent glass or two of wine, or sharing a few dishes with friends over a bottle or two, then it is most definitely on my list
5
The Wine Connection has been around for long and if they stay in business it's because they are serious about the customer experience.1. Great location and venue2. Great service3. Good prices on wine4. Good value for foodNo wonder they are always busy
4
We eat here quite often as it is close to where we live and we are seldom disappointed. The food is not fine dining but it is good quality and great value for money. The salads could do with a bit less lettuce and more of the quality ingredients, like tomatoes or grilled vegetables but the paella and other main dishes are very good. Great buzzing venue as well
5
Came here to celebrate my friend's birthday. We were a big group so we booked a table in advance (they take bookings til 7pm). It was a Friday night and the restaurant was really filling up. We ordered mains and tapas to share, the salmon pizza was good and so was the truffle pasta. Really enjoyed the cheap tapas too. But what we liked best was the moscato, the first was an Australian Azahara ($40) that was light and fruity, and the second one Italian, can't remember the name, but it was sweeter and also terrific ($35). Great service and awesome drinks
5
Simply awesome! Atmosphere, staff, service, food and wine selection and prices!This and the established Cheese Bar offer great value for money paired with good food and affordable wine! Polite and attentive staff make the experience overall very recommendable!Go there for the experience. Dj at night, casual, wine starting from $30 a bottle...Recommended for dates, couples, friend night-out. Any business meeting I suggest the Cheese Bar tho. They also have an outlet in Cuppage which I will check out the next days
5
Great Bistro with nice alfresco dinning street side. Nice selection of salads, pasta & mains. Deserts looked good. Nice friendly atmosphere with good service and a wide collection of wines. Cheese board looked good but had to restrain my appetite. Good bars nearby and ample parking. Great
5
I have to say that it is always a pleasure to come to this restaurant. Great environment, amazing service and the food And even more the wine at an affordable price in this expensive city. What else to expect?
5
Very good choice of wines and selections of cold meats and cheeses. Fantastic atmosphere. Great for an informal evening and Singapore and not as expensive as other options in the city. We will definitely be back.
4
Have been going here regularly, it is an excellent bistro, good servic, good food, value for money, worth a visit both lunch and dinner, enjoy.
5
Excelent wine
The best in town for value for money
Enjoy the cheese platter cold cut for $20 with nice btl of wine at $30 in great area.
Nice alfresco friendly and dynamic staff.

You can't go wrong with a place with a big queue and great ambience. Located at Robertson Quay, this is a gem of a place for a saturday night dinner and hangout. After being politely told that we may not get seats, we decided to wait it out anyway. Just 20minutes into it, we got great seats and great service.Pros: Despite the "atas" setting, the well-dressed crowd and great service - politeness, recommendations, serving speed and time, the menu was actually cheap! I mean, plenty of places with less than half of any of these qualities are priced about 2 times more atleast and most people, including myself didn't feel anything wrong about it.Wines start at $6 per glass - perfect place for those who never really knew how to appreciate wine. Pronunciation is a bummer tou, but the waiters very politely took their time to describe the differences and match to your tastes if you didn't know what to order.Food was too cheap for its quality - i mean i would really pay more. At this price, some patrons are confused and complained. I've had lousier food at MBS and the reviews were a lot better than what they deserved. Amazing. The food is perfect, quantity is perfect and the price is a little on the cheap side - which makes this place all the more so heartwarming.This is perhaps the best place to bring your date to If it doesn't work out, atleast you didn't spend too much. If it did, you'd probably never forget this place for a long time. Sweet, memorable and awesome! I highly recommend it :
2
We had really attentive service but the food was very so so. Greatest disappointment was the cheeseboard that came with just 2 slices of bread. No wonder we were offered a basket of bread when we bought it. Disappointed that it didn't come with any crackers or a better cheese/bread ratio.
4
We went to Wine connection with our friends on a Saturday evening. We made reservations, which would be recommended as it gets crowded during weekend. The place (one at Robertson walk) is big, with options of both; sitting out or inside. Their wine collection was amazing. Food was good too. Not very pricey and total value for money. Ambiance is good and so as the service. Would definitely go again and highly recommend it for wine & dine with friends/ family/ partner
5
This place is very large and I would guess there were around 150 people enjoying the food and drinks - it was packed at by 7 in the evening. We ordered pasta and pizza with grilled cheese/breadcrumb covered muscles as a starter, a bottle of really good Australian Merlot at 30S$ rounded off the meal - total ciost 77S$. A really good place to eat and drink - only comment was that with so many people enjoying themselves the noise level was quite high (needed to turn my hearing aid volume down a tad
1
I couldn't finish my dinner, They were so slowly in bringing me the food, and finally I couldn't order the dessert because They said the kitchen was already closed!! (At 11pm I think you don't need a big service to cut a piece o cake!!!)Very bad service, normally they tell you to make the last order before the kitchen close...Not professional!!
5
Four of us went for dinner and wine on a Friday night, and it was busy, we waited 45 mins for a table. (We arrived at 8pm) Having heard mixed reviews from friends, I was expecting slow service and just okay food. I was, however, pleasantly surprised. Service was prompt and extremely efficient. An excellent bottle of Argentinian Pinot Grigio was only $30. I ordered the filet mignon, $25, and it came cooked perfectly at medium rare, as requested. The grilled tomato, ratatouille and potato wedges it came with were equally well prepared. My friends ordered tapas, salad, and sea bass, and were all very satisfied with their meal. My only disappointment was the side order of asparagus which was six very skinny little pieces. All desserts are $6 and come in perfect sizes, we enjoyed chocolate lava cake with ice cream, lemon pie, and a generous portion of apple crumble with ice cream, which was nice if you like lots of crumble, a little too sweet though. I would most certainly go back to this restaurant, it was excellent value for money, especially in this neighbourhood. I am usually picky about my steak, but here I was very impressed with the preparation. Great ambiance and music as well
4
The food was great, had tapas and pizza. All looked good and delicious.
Price is reasonable. Service is okay. The fact that it's located on Robertson Walk makes it better.
A good experience indeed, well recommended.
4
An impressive wine list with reasonable price level. The tapas looked also good, but we did not eat any.
4
Good service, good food and a few good alternative beers. Recommended visit if you are visiting Robertson Walk
5
not sure why I took so long to go here. The value is realy good. quality of food very high but prices so good I had to double take. A great lamb shank for SGD 22! the wine list is extensive and not too crazy for Sing prices. Pizzas are really tasty. the tapas starters are all good too. been back twice and both times equaly good.Cant book after 7 so had to wait for 15 minutes next to the smokers, which with the kids was not great however.also have small but intersting selection of nice beersall in all goo
5
Very nice ambience.we didnt wait long to get a table for our party of 5.we had an array of tapas (salmon ceviche, crab cakes, smoked sausages) .Our glasses of wine cost from $6.it was so delightful to have reasonable wine and good music.i would definitely go bac
3
ambiance: noisy bustle, pretty okay for hanging out, music isnt overpowering, but be warned if you're seated outside.. it's very very very hotwine selection: this place is for the casual drinker.. wine is grouped in the menu according to pricefood: not so bad for the price, a steak goes for 24sgd++service: we usually go here saturday nights, and the key is to be patient. although the servers are nice, your requests won't be actioned until about the 4th repeat may be it as simple as asking for the menu or water.overall a pretty decent place if you're not so particular with your wine
2
The 'old' Robertson Wine Connestion was a favourite and this was my first meal in the newer Tapas Restaurant. I was left massively disappointed. The service was poor, they were missing many dishes and were not accommodating on alternatives when they were also missing component parts of the advertised meal. Especially bad as I had an important client with me.Not happy and will not be returning.
5
We strolled past on a Friday night and it was packed - so we figured ut had to be good. We didn't like our chances of getting a table but tgey fitted us in. Despite it being packed the service was attentive and good all round. The food was great and very well priced. My kids had main serves of pasta at $12 and were both very tasty. My husband and I shared tge meat platter $49 with thr choice of three meats we had rib eye lamb cutlets and duck - yumm yumm and yumm. They also have a great selection of tapas and pizza that looked great. The place was noisy but that suited us as we had kids - a great place
5
They have every type of wine you will like to have here, from very cheap to very expensive. Centrally located, it's in the heart of the city nightlife spot. Great staff and great food as well. Perfect if you want to hang out just with friends or colleagues and also very very romantic if you want a place for two. Don't miss it!
5
This is a huge restaurant only been to the one down cuppage and loved it there so wanted to go back asap was just in the Robertson Quay area.The assortment of wines and beers at great prices is fantastic; can even take a couple of wines home as they have an excellent selection to take home also.The food is very high quality and the service is excellent (they actually bring a table of food out at the same time and each course individually - rare in Singapore!)Sitting inside is fairly loud ambience but also quiet outsides if you prefer to chill out. Can probably take the young ones but earlier on might be more convenient
5
The perfect idea, great wine choices, nice tapas, excellent staff. only thing missing for me was some decent chill out music or even a bit of Latino would have made all the difference.
5
Great wines and food. Service was very attentive. Great place to chill and relax especially. Love it. Will come back more often for sure
4
A good place to go and taste wine from all over the world, very cheap prices (for Singapore!) and good food to go with it. Staff friendly and welcoming.The only thing that can be annoying is the very loud music, but the wine worth it!
3
One of the wallet friendly restaurant that may still exist in Singapore...Food average on quality side, nice ambiance though...overall, a good place to hang out after working hours or to catch up a buddy talk...
4
Great wine selection and very friendly staff. I specially love the eggplant caponata and the risotto balls, tapas proportion are good enough for 2-3 pax. High quality food! Affordable yet delicious! And most important of all, it's open until 3:00am!! :)
5
Good food , affordable prices, very nice atmosphere. good service. I've been here once only , but would definitely come back. So bad they don't take reservations on Sat . but we waited for over table only about 5-10 min
I highly recommend this place.
5
If you've been disappointed by cheap and nasty wines in Singapore restaurants try this joint. The service is top notch, the food is lovely and cooked with passion but what stands out is the wines - not just in quality but also in value for money. One of the few places in Singapore where a glass of good Shiraz doesn't mean you have to re-mortgage the house
4
This is one of my mid week favorites. The food is consistent and good value, as is the wide selection of wines. It is great to be able to enjoy a glass of wine mid week in Singapore without have to take out a second mortgage :) Favorite dishes are the meat selection platter, and meatballs. Try a glass of Paua bay Pinot and enjoy! This place is a well run machine dishing out good value and consistency
3
Nice to come here, chill and hang while the sun goes down.Drinks are priced ok,and selection rather nice with wine.Food is average,if you like your food with pictures on the wall like burger king its ok,me i prefer not to see the menu like its a fast food place.location is cool and so is the design
5
I visit here a few times a month. The value for money house wines are worth the visit @$6 plus the great atmosphere. Its always vibrant whatever night of the week which shows how popular it is. Food is reasonably priced..delivered quickly. Great staff doing a difficult job in such a large venue. Nice manager too. Make a visit
5
I go to wine connection on a regular basis. Staff are friendly and attentive. Service is always prompt. Wine prices really good for Singapore, the place is busy food qantity and quality is v/good. Give it a go lots of my friends do!
4
Great place for wine and dine, couldn't ask for more. Customized drinks and food to suit your palette, ambience is good, huge seating space so you never get disappointed. Do pick up a bottle of wine from their shop, great collection.
5
A great place to chill out and have a wine and meal, right on the river, great to just sit back and people watch
5
Go for the set lunch special - SGD 15 for a 3 course meal with coffee/ tea. Portions were just right and food was delicious. My husband and I always enjoy their lunch specials.
5
Great wine, good food, good location and nice ambience. Excellent service. The staff are very friendly and warm... making you feeling so welcome. Prices are reasonable. Friday evening and weekends are usually packed. Reservation is highly recommended.
5
Started going here when it was strictly a wine bar (3 years) & always enjoyed it. The combination of a reasonable selection of wine & good food is always good .. When you add this new tapas bar its menu & the crowd it's even better.
2
Met friends here during a stopover in Singapore. The four of us had a drink to start (Water $8, Beer x2 $9, Cocktail $14), which actually took two reminders and 30 minutes to arrive. That was the good news part of the day! A bottle of very average Australian Cab Sav was $75, and the total bill with some very average finger food was $198. I really don't know what else to say
2
On a lazy sunday, hubby and i decided to chill out for some drinks and small bite at wine connection. Ordered a bottle of moscato and some beer with a slice of cake. When ordered a pizza and pasta, as regulars who frequents Marche and da paolo for good italian food, we had asked for some chili powder and cheese powder to enhance the food. The manager in black shirt informed that chili and cheese powder would be chargeable at $2 each even for a small spoonful. It is never about the cost but i will never even pay if it is 2 cents. This certainly spoils my mood eating the plain pizza alone. Then they asked if we wanted to order more wine, we finish off the food and went next door to continue our drinks. Consumers definitely could decide where to spend their money. Service is worst than pizza hut

Business must be going well for them as they have recently opened the cheese bar...and no wonder. No frills, no surprises. They do what they do well! .Very reasonably priced wine and you can be as flamboyant as u want with your selection. The staff are polite and efficient ...food is available. It's perfect for accompanying a bottle. Hence the new cheese bar. Always has a loyal following with a lively atmosphere

We stumbled across this bar after doing an exhausting shopping walk in the area.The staff were very pleasant and welcomed us in to the bar area and quickly asked if they could assist us. It didnt take much convincing.The wines were cold and relatively priced compared to other places in Singapore. The ladies ordered house wines which cost $6 a glass although the glasses dont getted filled as high as they do in Australia. I suppose as the wine is a lot more expensive here they probably have to balance it out. It was very pleasant sitting around a wine barrel sipping on some drinks and the atmosphere of the area was very relaxed. This will definately be on my list to return to on our next visit.The only problem here is that they dont serve beer, so we moved to another bar nearby to enjoy a couple of Tiger beers. Its a shame they dont do everything at the same place.We didnt eat here but could see others enjoying the Tapas and other food. They seemed to be enjoying their meals

Pleasant street restuarant with good atmosphere, attentative staff, good food and reasonable prices ($4 -$22 is out of date but not by a great amount). No faults or complaints at all.

everything is in the best quallity, enjoy! wide variety of cheese and good collection of wines, nice team, easy walking access to clarck quay.

We were staying nearby and went to this restaurant for our last night in Singapore. The restaurant was very busy, but we were found a table outside which was just right for us. The inside tables were very noisy. The waiting staff were attentive, but unobtrusive. We had food from the tapas menu and a bottle of wine, the prices are reasonable. A lovely end to three days in Singapore
5
Wine Connection is a very busy bar and restaurant reservations can not be made for at 7 pm so it was very busy when we got there. There were 7 of us all eager to eat good food and drink nice wine. We waited 30 mins before we got a table but the girl at the front desk was very attentive and kept us informed of how long our wait would be. The Tapas is such good value for money and very tasty too. Pizza also was great. The staff were very friendly attentive and provided service with a smile. I highly recommend a visit for a great night out that does not hurt the bank account to muc
4
The service staff who greeted us and showed us our table was warm and put us in the right mood. We are thankful for the recommendation of the special for that day was the seafood paella which was done well. Other food we had were the platter with Parma ham, a Caesar salad and thin crust pizza. All were above average standards and pared well with a dry bubbly. Very happy with the evening out except for one minor problem; I found the place a bit noisy, symptomatic of the hard surface, close proximity of tables and a good crowd for a Monday evening. Still it will be a place we intend to frequen

I have been to the Wine Connection several times and it is great value for money. The Robertson Quay location is huge and they have a lot of waitstaff which is great. The service is always good. You can eat inside or out. The food is not gourmet but tasty and VERY reasonably priced. The is a good selection of wines which you can order by the glass or by the bottle but they do tend to serve the red wine too cold (but it warms up quickly in Singapore). The wine pour is not generous but it's probably the cheapest wine in Singapore so it's difficult to complain. To get there, you can take the MRT to the 'Clarke Quay' stop. This is a very low key, casual dining experience....great for hapy hour, sundowners, or late night nightcap
4
We hang out here sometimes, largely due to the location which is very good and the prices on the menu are very reasonable for Singapore. We had the Fat B wine which is very popular there, was good, and do try the Tapas as well. We've been here on few occasions on the weekends. Do try if you're nearby
4
We live just around the corner, and it's our favourite dinner hang out - we go on average once a fortnight. Great value-for-money wines, large selection of dishes that are reasonably priced. We love the $5 tapas selection as well! It has a fun, although slightly noisy atmosphere with top 40 hits playing, but you can always get a table outside if you want an al fresco and quieter dining experience. Fun place to go with a big group of friends, and no complaints about service or food

Last week our organization ANSA (association for norwegian students abroad) hosted a big event for Norwegian students in Singapore. We (370 norwegian stuendts) arrived at Wine Connection Tapas Bar and Bistro at Robertsen Walk at 6pm. We had booked the whole outside area, and parts of the inside area. The setting was very good, and placement and organization of food was excellent. The staff refilled the food tables countinously throughout the evening. We also had two "bars" outside where we had a selcetion of wine and beer. We had a great time at Wine Connection. The service and food was very good! We would recommend this restaurant for big events. Thank you for a great evening
4
Thoroughly enjoyed my experience at this very busy bar at Robertson Walk. The salad was absolutely delicious and the cheese platter to follow was even better. The wine ws reasonably priced which is suprising for a Singapore bar. The wait staff were very attentive and couldn't do enough for us. Loved it so much we are going to try the Cuppage Place this evening
3
This wine bar/restaurant is big and it is booming. I found the wine selection to be good and the pizza to be average. But overall, my meal was a good experience.
3
Maybe it was because we had been in Singapore for almost two weeks but this place reminded me of a marginal west coast eatery. If that's what you're longing for then go.
4
This place is a nice place to hang out with your friends. They have a nice selection of wines to choose from. The menu had lots to choose from, but they were mainly small platters, and the food was just okay. If you want to drink only, then this place is good. But don't expect much on the food side
5
A really good choice of wine on the menu. And it's surprisingly cheap for Singapore. We had the Fat b it was really nice red wine. There is a lot more to choose from on the menu.The only down side is that it's a really popular place and you might need to reserved or queue to get a table. We didn't reserved and went on a saturday night at 8:30. The restaurant was full but we could get a table within 20 minutes. I will advise to reserve ahead as it looks like a very popular place.The tapas were good as well. We had cheese and cold cuts platters. It was more than enough for 3 persons. The selection of cheese was great. The service was efficient as well specially considering how busy it was. They have 2 terraces and a main indoor area. It's really busy and a bit noisy but this is a nice feeling as it really felt like being in spain.A good place for going out with friends and wine lovers
4
I totally enjoyed the meal, I ordered the Osso bucco while my colleague ordered steak both good and served in a timely manner after entree. Ordered 2 bottles of wine 1 french and the other australian very reasonably priced for Singapore. I would definitely have no problem recommending this great little bistro to any business traveller. It appears as the warm up place for local groups of twenty something, prior to nightclubbing on ladies night
4
Great find for good food and reasonable priced wine in Singapore. A good choice of tapas to go with your wine. A great atmosphere and good service. I had tuna steak cooked rare on a bed of pasta and my husband a sirloin steak with ratatouille and potato wedges. All cooked perfectly and served really quickly
3
Wine is expensive in Singapore and Wine Connection is a place where you find good prices. Company is acting as wine distributor and is selling wine not much more expensive also in their restaurants. Food is good and reasonably priced. Why only three stars? Staff is not educated enough. They don't know much about wines they are selling, they can't open bottles properly, temperatures of wines we have had there were warmer than they should be.
4
I was catching up woth my friends in singapore and one of my friends took us here after dinner. A great place to hang around drink wine by the bottle for good value. We didnt really eat here other than the cheese n snacks so i cant rate it on food. But, atmosphere and wine wise a perfect place to chill.I see some of reviwers have had experienced bad serice but, i so belive getting service depends on the guests as much as the server. So, be nice to people n they will be nice to you. So simple!!If you are in singapore do not give this a miss
4
Great wine choices, this is the place to go if you like your wine by the bottle, the wine is reasonably priced than any other place in singapore. they have good starters to go with your wine. Main food is good, but there are better places nearby.Staff and service is bit slow
1
Such a horrible service I have received here! Their Indian supervisor was rude to us and refused to allow us to change our lunch order to the lunch specials. We were there during lunch and was only served the normal ala carte menu, hence we had no idea there was a lunch specials menu. After taking our order, another waiter came up to refill our water and passed us the lunch menu. That was when we realised that our dishes were part of the lunch menu, and asked to change it. The Indian supervisor said no, insisted that we should have known about their lunch specials because "we have a big, big board outside the shop and you didn't see it". Firstly, when you are in the service industry, you are in the SERVICE industry. His attitude stank, and the party group was aghast by his attitude. Secondly, when we then said we'll just cancel our order and reorder the lunch specials, he said no you can't. Thirdly, the food was just ok, nothing to rave about. Overall a disappointing experience. Just because of this ridiculous service, we're telling everyone in the office to avoid this place. Why would you want to pay $12 for an ok plate of pasta and get treated like crap
1
Microwave cooked food, poor replica of Italian clasics (and I thought the place supposed to be french or spanish...?)
Service reminded me I was in Manilla or Cebu...
4
This place is really great for an inexpensive drink and food.......for Singapore it's so reasonably priced......the quality, selection and selection of food is pretty extensive. Just make sure that you book if you want to guarantee an outside non-smoking table :)
4
Very good value for money, great cheese platter, good pizzas, good value on carafes of wine.Always very busy so go early evening or try booking. Also at several locations in Singapore
5
I had medium rare tuna with ratatouille and pasta, red wine and cheese. I was delighted and had an excellent experience. My family also had a good time. Would recommend and visit again.
5
Wine choice and most importantly cost for Singapore, is very good. If like me, you like more than a glass, this place is top notch. Platters (cheese and cold meats) go very well with a bottle or two. Main food is good, but there are better places nearby if you're looking for a proper meal. Socialising heaven
4
Definitely the place to chill out with friends after work or pre drinks. The selection of wines are good, the tapas are tasty, you can see about 6-8 service staff running around but most of the time you will have to fill your empty wine glass yourself
2
Service is going way down hill here. Been told REPEATEDLY they don't take reservations for Fridays and Saturdays - thats if youre lucky enough to have a real live person answer the phone instead of a recording or someone that claims to be in the "wrong side" or "wrong wine connection" and refuses to transfer you. Tonight (Friday) low and behold all booked up with reservations and a two hour wait list. It's amazing when a restaurant can't even get reservations right
2
It is bad enough to have an allergy, what is really bad is the few times I end up in restaurants who not respect the problem !! Like Wine Connection !! The bread that follow the dishes contains nuts and NO if I wanted without I had to buy a "bread-basket". Also, it is their policy that they cannot change any of the dishes on the menu to accomodate those with allergies. This means that if there is a dish with, for example, a sprinkling of nuts or a wedge of lemon, you can't chose to get it without.In spite of that, the service and the food was good.
3
The Wine Connection restaurant, and the nearby Wine Connection wine bar are lively and packed any day of the week. The menu is affordable, when compared to similar restaurants in Singapore, and the food is generally good. I really enjoy having drinks with friends at the Wine Bar where you can enjoy decently-priced wine and platters of tasty cheeses and meats
5
Reasonably priced wine, good tapas, located close to the river, this is a delightful place to spend a few evening hours. Have a board of cheese and cold meats, and enjoy a good Cabernet in the tropical warmth under a fan. No criticism here, and a lot to enjoy
3
Yeah it's ok, the covered/outdoor street is good and provides a great opportunity for people watching and atmosphere. The food was kind of bland though.
4
We found this by surprise as we were walking from our hotel at Clarke Quay up to Orchard Road. It's really good, a great selection of both wines and cheeses. Thinking of doing the same now myself. Great value, could have stayed for longer
5
The amazing collection of large bubbling restaurant, wine store and wine bar worked really well. More than once.
Food, wine and service were excellent, and the prices the best (especially for the great wine choice) seen so far in Singapore.
Keep it up please.
2
Came with a couple of girlfriends. When we arrived we had booked an outdoor table, however we were given an indoor table. When asked about it, the hostess very rudely informed us that it would be wet OBVIOUSLY since it just rained (this is despite the fact that there are a couple of tables of people outside). We ordered tapas to start which was not authentic at all. Pastas and pizzas are not bad. The food was very fast and hot when served which was great.Service left much to be desired. We had to ask for the same things a couple of times before it would actually arrive e.g. More water, another plate etc. The staff were also unpleasant and never apologetic for the lousy service.
5
Considering pricing of food & alcohol in Singapore this place was very well priced. A group off 3 of us got two pizzas gnocci and a ceasar salad plus giveÂ or take 6 drinks for just over $100.The service was excellent and obviously a favourite of the locals as it was getting very busy by the time we left
5
I had to google map the location to find out the name of this place, but such is the wanting for me to get you to go there. Each time I have been to SG I have always made an effort to enjoy at least a couple of Belgium wheat beers and plates of tapas at this place.The joy of people watching (mainly wealthy expats and locals), along with the bustle of office workers and tourists, whilst relaxing with a cold one and good food, at very reasonable prices. The Foundry across the river is also a good spot, albeit with much more expensive drinks and (judging by the two meals I have had there) poorer food quality.It can get pretty busy so it is worthwhile visiting earlier
5
After a year of walking by the Wine Connection Tapas and Bar, my wife and I finally decided to try this restaurant. When ever we pay by, we see that the place was packed and there was a waiting line. We decided to go early today - around 6 pm to try out this place.They have a great selection of tapas; main courses and dessert. We ordered a few tapas, the baked mussels and the lamb shank - one of the specialties. The anchovy-red pepper bruschetta was delicious. Cooked red pepper topped with an anchovy over a thin toast. The baked mussels was overcooked. On the other hand, the lamb shank was tender and very tasty. We saw several people also ordered this. Then we tried the cheese selection which had many different variety. Service from the predominantly Filipino crew was excellent! The best part was paying the bill. It was quite reasonable. We shall be back
5
Non withstanding the soft drink water scam mentioned by the previous reviewer this is probably the best place in Singapore to drink wine. You can drink wine here for little more than you can buy it in the grocery (that is in Singapore). Adjusting this for the fact that Singapore is world famous for bad service and bad value for your money, this place easily earns a 5/5 rating when compared to it's peers. In many other cities you would have to knock some points of but here in Singapore you really can't beat it
3
This is a lovely bar - decent food (pizzas, charcuterie/cheese plates) and fairly priced wines (relative to elsewhere in Singapore). But sometimes, good places do a really bad thing and it just leaves a really sour taste in your mouth. This bar DOUBLES the price of soft drinks and bottled water after 11pm. Yes double. The two pricing levels are published on the menu. They become more expensive than some of the alcoholic drinks, Why? This bar is heaving - jammed full every night. Not like they are doing a bad trade and need that extra money. It just looks like penny-pinching to me and an unfair gesture to non-drinkers. I did raise it with them and they told me i could have iced tap water for free...Now that just makes no sense !! Secondly the standard of service is variable. Call over a waitress and they will take the order from the one person who called them over and then walk away leaving the rest of the group with no order placed...I've had this experience every time i have been there. Surely they must understand that a table full of people are likely to want to order something!!??Reservations are accepted on some days only. (Early in the week). No bookings taken from Thursday onwards
5
Grt ambience, lot of buzz. Great collection of wines & beers too (surprisingly). The food was nice, cheese platter in particular...the food & drinks were priced very attractively.Only shortfall; staff was friendly but stretched takes a while to get their attention, the upside of that they leave you alon
4
Place to go with a few friends to have great value wine. Tapas and other food quality ok but not great. Not the place for a romantic dinner but great for a gathering with friends. Really exceptional
value for Singapore. Will definately go again.
5
Their new space on Robertson Quay is great. It's offer SO much more space on ambiance. They offer great wine at decent prices and good food with a variety of options. Great for a date or with a group. Will be going back soon.
3
a full day of shop hop hops.. end up lingering something fresh, cold and sweet.. hahhaha.. Belgian cherry beer? hm! why not! love my choice this time.. very refreshing and deep taste of cherry at the end. not bad indeed!
5
The Wine Connection at Robertson Walk (Taxi Rank) is by far the best branch of Wine Connection. Here you can have tapas and are able to mix-and-match from their menu rather than only be able to have a fixed (meat/cheese) platter. This is a great idea and allows you to be a bit more adventurous. The variety of wine both by-the-glass and by the bottle are great value. I always seem to have to ask for a coaster for my wine glass. They provide it for the water glass but they somehow think that wine glasses don't get condensation. To be honest, they've always given one when I ask and so this is really a minor complaint. Overall, it is generally a great deal although the setting is a bit rubbish as it's next to a taxi rank and has a constant flow of people walking through
3
Great food and wine and a nice atmosphere but this is conversation we had with the waiter. "I'd like the steak but without the ratatouille. Sorry we can't make changes to the order. Why not?It's our policy. ....but I don't want ratatouille"And so onIf the manager reads this it's a simply ridiculous policy and you need to fire the chef.
5
This pace offers a nice atmosphere; you can choose between non aircon or aircon table, standard table or high table, or you can also eat at the bar. So the place suits loners, families or a friends gathering. From 10pm or so the inside gets more dimmed and music gets a bit louder, good for having a drink by the high table area. The service is good, and there is free flow of iced water, that is so needed at Singapore,where you need to drink often to recover from transpiration. The wine list offers great choice, from relatively cheap options but tasty,to expensive. The list is really wide so everyone can be pleased, depending on how much you want to spend.The pizzas are great, on thin bread base, the way it should be. Pizza is great vaUe meal for the prize they charge.The tapas are really not that good, better not to order. The cheese is good and there is a wide selection go with the wine. There is separate bar at about 50 meters that basically offers cheese and wine, where the selection is amazing. These, however, is a different establishment, althoughnthe same name, so you have to hsve a look at both and decide which one of them suits your mood best. Enjoy it
3
My husband and I went here twice in the past month. Late night Friday for drinks was very fun and the service was great -- just wine and crackers, but felt it was the best service we'd had in Singapore yet. However, we later went back for dinner around 6pm another night, and the service was slow and hard to understand what we ordered, then they brought apps and the main course together -- which is not great when both are hot items
4
We came across Wine Connection by accident as it is not the front of Robinson Quay and we know the wine shops from Thailand and buy all our wines from them so thought we'd give them a try for dinner. First time was Friday night which was packed but the staff managed to find us a table and we had the cheese and cold meats platter. As others have said there are three WC all in same place but serving different food i.e. you can't get a full meal or tapas at the one we were at but can get everything at the other two. Wine is the big draw here of course as they sell at wholesale prices and in the very expensive Singapore this is fantastic. They also have a great range. The cheese and cooked meats were very good, service is very quick, nothing to complain about. Saturday decided to go again and went for the dinner option - were going to have tapas but that not impressed with offering so I have pasta and my husband had steak. Acceptable food,nothing to write home about but again price is very good and the wine is great. Certainly would visit again, and the atmosphere is great, noisy, good for people watching. and the service and staff are excellent. Just need Wine Connection to open a restaurant next to their Bophut shop in Koh Samui now!
4
As wine drinkers, this was always our favorite evening stop to share a bottle of wine mid-week.A bottle of your favorite wine costs about the same as in the supermarket and much less than most restaurants.The service is always impeccable and very friendly. The deli style food is always very fresh and tasty. A great place to meet new friends, and convenient for walking along a stretch of the Singapore river
4
Was planning to head to Wine Connection for the racclett today, but actually missed the branch - they have several outlets in Robertsen Walk, and we chose the tapas one - which did not have racclett. Ordered some tapas, beef and ravioli. After we ordrered the food, I took a short walk over to find the branch with the racclett, found it just around the corner, and also find we need to reserve a table there for next time. When I came back, my tapas was at the table waiting for me;bruchetta with parma - very good, would have liked some tomatoes added too to get it perfectFried riceballs with ham and cheese - very eatable!Mozerrella sticks - good, and both these and the riceballs together actually got abit too rich. Garlic & chili prawns ; good taste. Salmon Ravioli - ok, but abit boringBeef - very goodAll in all - very good. Also found there is a show just outside every Thursda
4
I love wine connection good food, reasonable priced wine and great atmosphere. Friday and Saturday nights are very busy here but go check it out if you are near Robertson Quay. Best value and best atmosphere in Robertson Quay!
4
There's more than one Wine Connection on Robertson Walk, the nice one is Wine Connection Tapas Bar and Bistro (white font on black background) It's always crowded and has a nice atmosphere, good wine, and OK food (not excellent) but the overall experience is good.
5
We were in Singapore for holiday/business trip during the Euro 2012 Football. Wine Connecction have several outlets in Singapore and we visited this one every night of our 7 night stay in Singapore for a bottle or 2 of wine!!!. and a cheese platter...yummmy. We also used the cafe/bistro next door for a set lunch which included a glass of red or white wine and dessert and also dined in the tapas place they have in Robertson Walk but we did not have tapas but an excellent steak which was good value even at Singapore prices. Would recommend giving it a go. All the staff were very friendly and took the time to chat (like to use their english) One member of staff of note was Gunarlan, a young malaysian guy
2
The concept is good but disappointing, the wine is great but the cheese and bread are quite disappointing. We requested the two lots of bread asthenosphere first was very dry the second wasn't much better. The cheese offering was ok but you can go to the supermarket 100 yards away and achieve the same or better
5
Wine Connection has a number of outlets in Singapore and in all of them you have a wide selection of very affordable wines. Already for 30 SIN $ you get a reasonable bottle of wine but it gets truly excellent if you are ready to spend 40 or 50.The atmosphere at the Wine Connection at Robertson Walk is great. You would not come for the food (this by no means a proper Spanish Restaurant or even Tapas Bar) but it is edible in case you like to have a few bites with your wine. So the best plan presumably is to first have a good Chinese meal somewhere and then come for the wine
1
Went last night. The rib eye steak was so so. Not worth the title of Steak, mushrooms I am not sure what that was and don't mention the potatoes. i asked them not to add an item that they had listed on the dish. This was not allowed and I was asked to pick another dish instead. The management was nowhere to be seen.At the end of the meal I asked for a slice of bread to finish my cheese platter as I had a big slice of blue cheese left, this was not allowed unless I bought a bread basket. Only after I said I am going to do a review on Tripadvisor did a slice of bread appear. Our dinner a some wine cost us each $147.00 so it was not a cheap night and the service was the most inflexible I have yet come encountered in Singapore. I am not sure I will be returning again
5
This is the place that i would recommend to anyone who likes wine. I use to be a regular customer at Wine company but not anymore after discovering Wine Connection. The wines are incredibly good value cheaper than most places and delicious tapas, lamb kofta, merguez sausage & many others to go with it. Delicious food & good cheese platter & get the forever flowing bread. After 10pm the music gets even better with their in house DJ. Its always very busy on fr & sat for dinner so if you want to have dinner you have to be early or else come for a drink & chill out. I've been there many time & will be there again & again
4
I went their with my fiancee for a dinner. Right it was very busy !Ans we soon understood why... a nice offer of wine at moderate price and great food.I am not a specialist of tapas but it was very yummy.Despite the crowd, staff managed well to serve us on time.Definitely we will come back 
5
Have been in and out of Singapore for years and finally a perfect place to eat and drink.The place has a 5 star ambience and one may be lured to think this a restaurant, but it is actually BISTRO.Have eaten there many times and always good service and so is the food.No wonder this is a favorite place for the x-pats. This is VALUE for money!Love the place!!!!
2
Wine connection has always been one of our favourites in Singapore specially the wine is quiet reasonable for Singapore prices.The food at the outlet in Unity street was always ok, but since they don't serve food on weekends anymore we had to go over to their new, bigger outlet at Robertson Walk. Service was very poor and the quality and taste of their Tapas was more than disappointing. Very long waiting times for food and drinks. Not like the old wine connection anymore:-( As I heard they also changed their manager- maybe that's why..
3
We sat outside - it had a great atmosphere for a Tuesday night. Meals OK but the Tapas a much better option.
4
My wife and I love to share their platters with a nice bottle.
4
I would recommend anyone who likes wine to visit here. The wines are incredibly good value and the snacks to pair with them range from cheese, charcuterie and mezze all of which are perfectly decent. It's casual but enjoyable
5
The best "wine" place I have visited as of yet in the region SE Asia. Nice selection of snack/finger food = cheese and such.
4
I would recommend anyone who likes wine & food to visit the new tapas bar . The wines are incredibly good value and the snacks to pair with them range from Tapas, cheese, charcuterie, salad, good steak and pizza all of which are perfectly decent.They have as well live DJ from wednesday to Saturday.Â

Was there with a few friends one night to hangout...but when we reach the place it was pack! And no server there to serve us politely! The server ask us to check and get our own table! Then when we manage to get one and was ready to order...they refuese to let us order and told us to get back in line to wait for a server to lead us to the table...when we did that...another server refuse to lead us to our table and say its full house...and that the table can only occupy 4 people when we have only 5 people... Then we saw that the other table, they have like 7 people in a small table and some only 2 people and are occupying one big table...when we aprroach them about that issue they insist that its the policy! What kind of policy is that!!! We feel that we have been discriminated and treated unfairly just beacuse we are asian..we find that the attitude towards the caucasions are soo nice... N polite...(no offend to the caucasions)...when we decide to leave another asian coupld came to ask for table..they say thatt it was full house!!!Wine connection use to be one of my favourite placd to hangout every other week...but now i insist that i will never visit any other wine connection place anymore..

The place was recommended to us by a friend so we decided to check it out on a Saturdsy night. The place is huge, fake rustic with a long bar counter. When we arrived the place was packed but we got a table inside pretty quickly. So far so good. The first thing that we noticed was that the music was way too loud and it was hard to make conversation. We ordered an array of food ranging from salads over pasta and pizza to a cheese platter. The pizza was ok, the pasta and salad average. The cheese platter just ok. The only real good dish was the Carpaccio. We chose a New Zealand white which was also very decent. While the service during dinner was ok, we waited more than half an hour for our bill to be processed by the cashier. While we were still waiting, the staff already cleared, cleaned and prepared our table for the next customers which we thought bordered on the rude. All in all a just ok place to go for a glass of wine. There are better and cosier wine bars around. That said, Wine Connectoon's prices are reasonable so still worth a visit once in a while.
2
This place used to be great. Quiet, understated with class but sadly its gone, or at least that was the message we were given when we arrived at 9:30 on a Saturday night...We sat down and tried to order only to be told that it was closed and we needed to go to the "new place" around the corner...We asked why we couldn't have a bottle of wine as others were still drinking and this wasn't an option because "we are encouraging people to drink at the new Wine Connection Tapas"...So we went around the corner to discover a loud and large characterless room full of drunk people... Maybe it was the opening night...We tried to get served but couldn't so gave up and moved on.When you have a good formulae stick to it and don't mess things up.No more Wine Connection for us

We went to this restaurant to celebrate a special evening. They don't take reservations which I think for a place like this is a silly policy! Right from the onset horrible service. We waited at thr hostess stand for 15 minutes and asked three waiters only to be blown off. Finally the hostess appeared after flirting at bar with guests to tell us no tables available but we could wait at tapas bar shouldn't be longer than 15 minutes. Once there we waited another 25 and after asking 4 different servers if we could order a drink 1 menu was thrown at us which was just the wine bottle list! After another 10 minutes we finally got someone to take our drink order. Then I went to hostess to check on table and are said it wouldn't be doable and we should be happy we got a seat at the bar to just order food there. We were ready to leave but starving so we just ordered food after again having to get a waiters attention. Then we ordered tapas as appetizers and our main courses came out all first. He didn't even put in our tapas order correctly. Then one of ordered tuna steak medium rare and it came out well. Three waiters kept coming over to us telling us that it was medium rare. It was like bark. Finally a manager came over and told us it was well and they would make us a new one. This restaurant needs to have service training and some serious lessons on running a business and keeping your customers first! Or it will be out of business fast. Just because 10% service charge is automatically put on the bill shouldn't equal poor service. Really the good food of this restaurant went right out the window because of service and we left to go to another establishment to have drinks after dinner because we really couldn't take it anymore.

After requesting a table outside road-side was sent to that area to be told i couldn't sit there yet as they were cleaning. Went back to the entry side and told that wasn't true and we could sit roadside. Went over again and was told no you can't sit there til 5. Went back to original entry side and sat down, before being told they could actually seat us roadside... returned for the third time and sat down finally. After deliberation, I ordered a bottle of champagne and 2 beers. They returned to say they were out of said champagne... ordered another bottle of champagne on the list.... they returned to say that too was unavailable... tried again with another bottle... they then returned to say that bottle was also unavailable, as well as the brand of beers that were ordered. They then proceeded to point to 8 different brands of beers that were similarly not available. Got up and left. Don't know what they even opened the doors

It is indeed a nice place to go for wine, as well as steak, it was juicy and tender. Then plus a Moscato we ordered, that's completely satisfied!

Extense wine list. Went there a coupe of times before or after dinner. Kind of expensive, Good wine always Is in Singapore.

Need I say any more than above? Try and get a table out front and watch the people go by. Make sure you order the pick your own cheese/dips platter and get the ever flowing bread!

My mom took me here for cocktails and we had a wonderful time. The wine is cheap, much cheaper than you would find in other Singapore bars. There's a really delicious prosecco that's 7 dollars a glass. Our small tapas plates were tasty as well. We had the cheese plate, patatas bravas, and lamb kofta. Service could use some work. There were times when we had three different waiters attending to our every need, and then times where nobody was refilling our wine glasses! But overall, it was a great night with good food and wine

The Robertson Walk Wine Connection has a Tapas Bar inside the main courtyard area and we were excited to try as we enjoy tapas style food. Got to say very disappointing from the moment we walked in. Cold miserable staff started the out 'experience', a dirty fork with food between the prongs and plates covered in fingerprints should be inexcusable in a restaurant but where placed on the table and we got a glare when asked to change them. When the food started to come the bread was stale, the meat tasted slightly off and miserly wine portion.The restaurant is on our doorstep but won't be going back in the near future

I stumbeled upon this place at Cuppage (different location then the one mainly reviewed here, must be a new branch) off Orchard Road. Had dinner with 2 collegues. Service was fast and good, menu had good choices. We were sitting outside at barrel tables under a newlybmade roof...nice. Quality, presentation and test are fine. However the shockingly great experience is their winelist against great prices. We had 3 stakes, 3 deserts and a bottle of superb! Italian wine for less than $180. We will certainly come back again soon, this place is highly recommended

I was recommended to visit this group of restaurants by a friend. I arrived quite late at a nearby hotel and wanted a late supper so decided to try this branch in Unity Road by Clarke Quay. It looked quite attractive - it is basically a deli with cheeses, oils, vinegar's and sauces in bottles in floor to ceiling bins. It also had bins of wines. There was a large light coloured wooden table at which people could sit and a few separate tables.I ordered pasta and a glass of wine. The pasta came within about two minutes and lacked the meat that was supposed to be in the sauce (chicken). It was totally uninspiring and bland.The wine eventually came (one of about 3 reds served by the glass). They used a large glass but put a miserably small amount in it. A request for a proper helping was refused. The staff were surly and rude. The cheese platter being shared by a couple at the other end of my table looked mean.I would never go back there

Walked there after dinner for a drink and dessert. The dessert option is limited, so we order a cheese platter (3 kinds of cheese, nuts, bread, crackers, fruits) and a bottle of red wine-- total bill about S$55. Very please with the generous serving. Reservation is recommended for better table than we had. We were seated at a large table sharing with a group of gals, and several other couples, located in the middle between the cash register and take home imported packaged food & wine. As such it's rather loud and difficult to hear conversation from across the table. The place offers a decent menu based on what was ordered by dining neighbors. Extensive wine options, if not going there for dining, definitely go there to pick up wine for home

We stumbled across wine connection one Sunday morning while searching for another shop and couldn't resist the cheese and deli display.A great breakfast selection for the stout of heart - eggs benedict, oodles of cheese, crusty bread - and some lovely pasta and meat choices for lunch.Next door is a larger wine store with a few stools to enjoy a quiet sip.There is also a great takeaway deli selection and some great pasta and homebaking choices.Not cheap but reasonable for S
