I come here quite often during transit or visit Singapore. They serve my order quick and fast, suitable for me who has no much time. Their burgers are ready grab to go. Tasty and big portion. Too big for me actually.

- Very reasonable prices and food (by airport and Singapore standards)
- Good quality (as one would expect from Burger King in Asia)

I'm not sure how they could stuff up fresh food so bad. Looking around at the other visitors everyone is pulling stuff out of their what ever it is. A disgrace to Burger King.

Between two planes we must eat so we choose this fast food, and the meal was tasty, the portion are big.
Attention - We pay with Visa card, because if you pay with euro, or USD dollar, they give you back Singapore dollar.

Sometimes when traveling you want something like home, and this is it, Standard hamburgers, fries and a coke, All good. THEY ARE BUSY! so expect a short wait. Not expensive, and the usual good.

I generally only pass through Singapore Airport a couple of times every 4 years and usually have around 8 hours stop-over on my way back to the UK. We landed at Terminal 2 although our next flight was leaving from Terminal 3, as we had loads of time on our hands we had a mooch around T2... It was as you'd expect very busy but there were some tables free at Burger King, so we opted to go in... In all my adult life I think I've only eaten Burger King about 4 times so I have little experience to base my thoughts on... We both opted for a meal deal and the food we were given was hot, looked quite appetising and wasn't too expensive given the location. My only gripe would be the amount of ice in the Coke... No need to do that, just serve a smaller Coke! For speed of service, cleanliness of eating area and general atmosphere you certainly couldn't ask for better

Store at Terminal 2 has closed and moved to Terminal 1 (arrival hall) next to belt 23.Had breakfast at this new location (Terminal 1). Place less than 50% occupied. Croissant was too soft and egg was cold. May have left unsold for sometime. Service is good

Not good pay top price chips are cold, they say extra long cheeseburger it was normal size but instead of being round it was rectangular.I found the menu board deceitful, very expensive nearly $10 for a medium meal, post mix Coke was ok they did as requested and gave no ice.But the mortal sin cold chips, they don't care when you complain they look at you angry.Will never come back again was an absolute to rip of

1st thing that came to our mind for breakfast at the airport was BK. However, we must say the food Standard seem to have dropped. Patties were hard & dry, onion rings were sourish & pancakes not fluffy. In short, a disappointing bfast.

First experience at a Burger King. Taste like plastic, waste of money (although you get what you pay for) and the customer service is poor, no smiles or friendly service.

Burger King has always been my favourite burger joint. Service is quick and friendly. Ordered the BBQ Turkey Bacon this time and it's super yum.

Burger King with most fast food lies on being slightly more expensive than a meal at the hawker.A burger along with fries and a drink, with acceptable friendly service. Burger King is one of the places where you need to grab a meal on the run, or can chill around with your meal for your flight

Good burger as normal.... but never see so bad service after 4 times ....with same service i must do this complaint is so slow, so incompetent, staff to old cannot stand on their own leg.!!!!..... no brain available, to organise and give you food, so so so disappointed, for suitable city ....so bad .....i strongly suggest to dont go their again...

Just arrived from a long trip overseas and was craving for BK! Had their Angus Burger and it did not disappoint. For a fast food joint this is up there. The smell of their burgers fresh off of a grill is to well worth it.Would be coming back on our next trip
