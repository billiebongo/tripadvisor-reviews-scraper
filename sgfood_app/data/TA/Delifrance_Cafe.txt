In the small corner of the Gleneagles hospital lobby corner, this is one of the practical corner to grab meals.
I always get Double Mayo Tuna Croissant and mocca eclairs...üòçüòç.
Don't expect a good service thoughüòä.

I can't leave the Gleneagles hospital without getting their mocca Eclaire and the "double shot" tuna sandwich. Love them a lot for a quick bite while visiting the place.
Be ready for quite a queue during meals hours.

Curry puffs & coffee eclairs for me, and chocolate croissants & sultana buns for my kids are our favourites.

This cafe is quite tiny, but serves appetising, fresh french croissants and lots of freshly baked breads and cakes. Not to worry, there is always space to have a sit- down meal, somehow. You can have your sandwich with a croissant, baquette (french loaf), or choice of an other available bread there. The fillings are very varied with tuna, chicken, beef slices, hard boiled eggs, mix seafood fillings.....and all certified HALAL by the Muslim food authority at Singapore. There is also a variety of dessert cakes packed for taking away....and of course you can order to eat-in. The peek time will be during lunchtime, when you may be unable to find a seat and table to eat in. The coffees, teas are also quite satisfying and has enough aroma for you to decide to have a 2nd cup. You also have a chance to get close to the locals who eat and have meals there.
