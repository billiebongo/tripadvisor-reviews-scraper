Such a quaint cafe with excellent service, coffee and lounge/house music. I only had a small breakky which was nice and I imagine the other food would be nice as well. Latte was expensive around $5 but I think that's pretty standard around here :)

Nice ambience. Tables were small. Ordered 3 mains and a side and the table couldn't house all the plates and glasses.

Have been here several times. Good coffee and good food. Serious about their coffee. The barista got me a new cup when he realised there was no crema in the one he brought over.

it's difficult to find a good cup of coffee in this part of town. Not only good coffee but they also have some noice stuff for breakfast too. went twice.

Read very good reviews of this cafe and decided to give it a try. We ordered a duck confit ($24), duck confit & waffles ($22), two 20F Ice Coffee (their signature drink at $6.50 each) and a Matcha Green Tea cake ($5.80). I love my duck confit & waffles. I enjoyed combination of crispy skin and tender meat with waffles/ice cream. The green tea cake is flavorful with green tea and has a bitter aftertaste. I like this way and overpower by sugar. The signature coffee is a must to try! Everyone will enjoy it

Came to this cafe with colleagues after work on Christmas eve. We ordered pork vine spaghetti, duck confit spaghetti and 20F Flat. All of us enjoyed our food and it was a surprise to us as the food is not pricey at all, below $20. This cafe had just open recently, and the service is good, the food is good.They have a Christmas special coffee with had rums and raisins. This special coffee is good enough as a limited edition drink. Good place, good price, good food to visit again soon. Look forward to my next visit to this cafe

It was December and they had a new Christmas Edition 20F Iced Coffee (SGD 7). There was a scoop of creamy rum & raisin ice cream in fresh milk and espresso, decorated with marshmallows, cranberries and pistachios. I am not a coffee connoisseur but I had to say that the drink was so smooth it sailed right into the abyss of my tummy.We also had the Prawn and Poached Egg Pasta (SGD 17) that came with grilled prawns tossed with linguini in white wine cream sauce, topped off with a runny poached egg.The Pulled Pork Egg Benedict (SGD 18) consisted of a generous amount of pulled pork atop lightly toasted brioche with two poached eggs drenched in chipotle hollandaise. The eggs arrived threatening to burst through their frames and I had the honour of poking them.For 8 bucks, we got a good slice of matcha cake with vanilla bean ice cream and a small tub of matcha sauce. The matcha sponge cake was moist and softly pressed against the rich matcha-y mousse. I thought it tasted good
