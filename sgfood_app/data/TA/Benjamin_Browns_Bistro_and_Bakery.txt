I just love their muffin, like seriously deliriously delicious! Place is decent, love to drink coffee here when it is not crowded... Earplugs in and spotify before going to work!!! Such a good feeling!

The food is very nice! We ordered fish and chip and beef salad. We loved the great ingredient used, fresh and nice!
3
I ordered the Cookies & Cream milkshake.
The milkshake is good for your instagram photos but not very good for the taste.

Serving portions are good for sharing. The milk shakes looks really good but a tad too sweet for my liking but would be a great treat for people with a sweet tooth. Definitely must try the smoky nachos!

My entire family (10 people, including my Grandfather in a wheelchair) tried to get a table at around 12.30pm after our lunch. The staff were terrible. They were completely disinterested (the 3 waitresses we spoke to were all 20ish-year-old females) Due to my grandfather being in a wheelchair, they were even more reluctant to help out. This was very offending for me as it was discrimination against handicapped elderly, not a behaviour a family-friendly café should advocate. The entire café had many seats around and we even offered to split our seating arrangement. The staff just looked down at their phones and told us "cannot, cannot". In the beginning, we were ready to spend a lot of money on the milkshakes and other desserts due to our large party of people, however they just turned us down due to our handicapped Grandfather. The staff were NOT HELPFUL at all and had VERY BAD MANNERS. It was sickening because as 20ish year olds they should have given us a proper reason besides "cannot" since there were sufficient seats at the café and it was well enough to accommodate all of us. Benjamin Browns has been a huge disappointment and I would like to spread the word NOT TO VISIT THE CAFÉ. In a service industry, the staff should learn to communicate properly with the customers and turn us down properly if they are unable to accommodate us. Very disappointing.

Just a word of warning about Benjamin Browns #benjaminbrowns at forum shopping centre. Avoid this place like the plague! Stopped in today and things started badly when the waitress was too busy playing on her phone to take out order. When we eventually managed to get some service we ordered the nachos without bacon. 20 mins later (seriously how long does it take to melt some cheese over tortillas!) the nachos arrived with bacon pieces in it. When we pointed this out to the staff, they disputed it and then the chef poked his head out of the kitchen and said not to serve us any more. Not sure how else they could have screwed up

5 of us ordered 5 different dishes; oinkdon, moodon, pepperoni pizza, mushroom n truffle pizza, and spicy crabmeat pasta. We also ordered the much raved nutella banana shake for dessert and truffle fries. There r 3 different kind of pork in oinkdon - shreaded pork belly, fried pork chop and grilled pork chop. The fried and grilled pork chop were so hard n dry n tough i only ate 1 bite for each of them. The sambal fried rice was only spicy but there wasn't any fragrance or sambal taste. The beef in moo don though there were thinly sliced, but it wasn't juicy and tender. The meat dried out by the time my husband finished his rice. As for the rest of the main courses, there were jjst as bad tasting. Though the dessert is instagram worthy, but the taste was disappointing. The over all experience was made worst when each dish cost about $30++. There is completely no basis to charge such a price for such quality

I chanced upon this place while my daughter was having lessons at Julia Gabriel.Each time she goes for lessons, i park myself here. The only disappointing thing about this place is the space. It is quite small and can be quite cramped when all the tables are filled. It gets pretty crowded too during the weekends.Food I have tried1. Clam chowder - i order this each time i come. It is served with the brioche bread. The portion could have been a little more for its price. 2. Cheese sandwich - This is so good. When i was pregnant, i craved for this!! Using brioche bread again, the use of the cheeses taste excellent. Even my mum who is not a cheese fan, enjoyed it. 3. Beef salad and seafood salad - Portion is big and the dressings used for these two salads are good. Beef is nicely done.4. Carbonara - i order this for my girl. This cannot be eaten by one person as it does get too creamy towards the end.5. Mentaiko and aglio olio pasta - who can say no to mentaiko and aglio olio. excellent pasta. would personally prefer the aglio olio to be a little more spicy6. beef chunks - beef served on a hot plate. good chunky pieces but if u left it on the hot plate for a little more, it becomes a little done. 7. beef taco - was interesting to see kimchi in a taco. unique taste, not too bad.8. quesadilla - i find this quite similar to the beef taco except for the different 'housing'. taste was just so so to me. 9. pork chop - big piece of chop. i think because of the thickness, it was a little tad too tough but the taste was good together with the sauce.10. OTT burgers - big portion. taste not too bad, nothing too fantastic. can try for the sake to take an instagram worthy pic. 11. Old school - ordered this for my girl. she loved it. 12. Lava pillows - each time i tell myself to try something else, i keep ordering the same. Its not too sweet and it just tastes so good. I do not like the strawberry pop tart though. it does not blend in with the rest of the ingredients.13. Rainbow cake - give it a miss. The cake was disappointing. it was dry and the cream in between the layers was not smooth. Could see that it was dry and breaking into pieces. My girl barely ate one quarter of the cake. Which kid would not finish a sweet treat?14. Watermelon and lychee smoothies - refreshing! similar to what you can get in boost.We wanted to try the molten lava cheese burger but we were informed that it would be served only after 12. (Yes, some items are only served after 12 pm) But, we saw another table having it. Other than this lapse, their service is normally quite good. The prices are a little steep but being in the town area, i guess they are still acceptable.If i have eaten something and did not add in this review, it was probably too insignificant for me to remember

Came here specifically for their one-of-a-kind milkshakes and we were not disappointed! Positive, upbeat service, and shakes were just what we wanted!! Ordered the "Old Fashioned", the "Honey Pops", and the one with the Fruity Pebbles cereal. Amazingly delicious!! The Fruity Pebbles was a vanilla shake, with two large wafers, red velvet cake, little cookies, whip cream, and cotton candy -- YUM!! The "Honey Pops" had Sugar Corn Pops cereal, chocolate cake, chocolate Pop Tart, whip cream, and Garretts caramel popcorm.. Equally delicious. The shakes were $16 SD, and a plain vanilla shake was $14 SD. I thought the shake looked small when they brought it out, but it was MORE than ample and well-worth-it, in my opinion
3
Fancy presentation but slow slow service. A slice of cake never arrived. Milk shake is not well shaken but perhaps that is the presentation. Coffee was good. At other tables we observe the fancy presentation but hey, start with the basics, good tasty food, good service and skip the fluff for m
3
Known for their over-the-top Instagram-worthy shakes, both food & beverages are overpriced for the quality offered.
5
The food, albeit slightly on the pricey side, was extremely worth the penny and the portion was definitely worth paying for. We had the fish tacos and the crabmeat linguine and it filled our tummies with joy :-)
4
Didn't get to try the molten lava burger, as it was unavailable but the sides was delicious as well. The drink menu is interesting
5
Chicken and waffle was extremely delicious and breakfast for 2 to share was hugae as well! Yummy food!
4
Tucked in a corner of the Forum shopping mall, this is undoubtedly one of the quieter cafes one can find in town. Pricey food though for the mildly average food.
4
I always enjoy visiting this restaurant, since the food (especially the drink) is good...should try the milk shakes..very recommended
2
This is supposed to be a place where they serve very "insta-worthy" drinks. Fancy as they may sound and look. I was a bit disappointed in the taste, its no big deal... things u and I can do better at home when we need to satisfy that craving.The staff is what made this whole place feels negative. It is a dessert place, supposed to be happy and positive. The staff seems disinterested in us and the customers. NO smiles, no expressions, NO EYE CONTACT, even as we placed our order and got the bill. When they served the drinks, it was so stealthy that we didn't even know it was there. Not reccomended unless u really wanna drag your mood down into the mud.
4
We got a couple of pieces of cake to go from here, and one was really dry and not very good, but the other (Speculoos) was unbelievably good. So I really think it's hit or miss. The place was busy, so I guess it's generally very good. Tip: don't take the last slice of cake--it'll be dry
5
This is a nice place in the 2nd floor of the Forum The Shopping Mall, at Orchard Road. They offer a small list of dishes, but they are very tasty. I have tried their pasta and fish dishes and they are delicious. However, the most tasty thing to try is the desserts. The chocolate muffin is one of the best in town. The restaurant also offers a wide range of cakes and the slices are huge and rich. If you wanna try a good cake, this is the place to go. The red velvet cake is fantastic
4
Had a spicy seafood pasta that caused some minor discomforts, albeit rather sensual and flavourful. With ample, perhaps generous, seafood mixed in the pasta, it was a meal that justified the price tag. Affordable, but maybe on the high side. But this little corner cafe/restaurant at the Forum serves as a quiet getaway from the shopping crowds. Worth a visit, but may not consider a return
3
Pleasantly surprised by the sliders - they were way bigger than expected. Didnt try the famed shakes though.
5
they have iconic over the top milkshakes, which makes one smile as well as nostalgic, which is the old school.
4
Main purpose of the visit is bringing the kids for their overthetop milkshakes. They always have the same order- Mac and Cheese and Old School milkshake.
5
Love the over the top milkshakes. Not my time first having but great for photos and great for catching up with friends!
3
We went here for dinner. I ordered the steak pieces on hotplate, and also clam chowder. My wife had the Fish n Chips. The food looked good on the plate, but tasted rather bland. The chowder was good, but should be renamed "clam-flavored potato soup", which is what it was. The steak was OK, medium rare-ish, but bland. The battered seabass, tasted a little fishy, probably too old. All in all not a very enjoyable dining experience, and a little pricey to boot. Not worth it in my opinion
1
Went for the OTT shakes but I must say that I was disappointed. For the price paid, I find myself having a preference for the milkshake at MacDonald. Owner should seriously consider using better quality ingredients. Interesting, my fren who went on a separate occasion has the same review. However, I have to admit they did a gd job on the visual aspec
4
My wife and I visited this place based on an Instagram picture (yes, that's true). It was a hot, sticky Singapore day and their desserts were so welcome. They offer "over the top" milkshakes that are some of the most unique, creative and delicious desserts I've ever had. I will let my own photos speak for themselves. I ordered a coffee avacado milkshake and my wife the Nutella banana. Simply incredible and worth a visit
3
Went there with the wife as we saw this cafe being recommended on one of those "Top ten must try cafe" websites.Decided to drop by for the milkshakes one day. The shakes were humongous due to the overloading of cookies, cream, ice cream and random stuff. Mine survived almost a minute after serving before falling apart. Taste-wise, nothing memorable.The cafe does serve food and the hot plate stinks up the entire restaurant after a while. Cafe can get crowded suddenly as big groups will enter for the drinks and leave soon after. The crowd comes and go throughout the day so do try your luck if you want to experience the milkshake
4
Bought the children here after their dinner for an unexpected tasting. The location is slightly off Orchard Mrt. We ordered their best seller Coffee Avocado and Thai Milk Tea for the bdae boi.The avocado blended in the coffee is so nice and I love it! As for the thai milk tea, it's overly too sweet for us. We were satisfied thou the price for the milkshakes are priced at $16++
4
We walked past this place and saw the milkshake signs and knew we had to try one. My son and I decided to share 1 as my husband opted for water. The drink looked amazing we had the old school one. The biggest thing was the cost, when fees are added it cost just under $19 for 1 milkshake, you would be broke if the whole family wanted 1.
4
It's a date place but families still go there to savor there pastries and main courses and ginormous shakes (avocado!). Try the meat and pasta which though served slow packs a mean wallop.
5
I was there with my family to take a breakfast. It's great food with fantastic service. The stuff very helpful specially yuki she is perfectly
5
The place has a very nice atmosphere and the price was ok. The milkshake was the nicest I have seen and had too. I highly recommend this place
2
Wanted lobster roll as other table ordered but was told theirs was degustation menu & had to preorder. Ordered Thai tea shake but no red rubies & marshmallows weren't toasted as stated in menu. Reply from staff was menu changed. Menu was not even updated!
4
the good is good and very insta-worth. The lobster roll is really good and the thick yet tender US pork chop make the dinner experience here great. We order the milkshake to share and it's overly sweet and chocolaty
4
Love the cheese sandwich and the rainbow cake! :) Each layer of the cake tastes different (which is a rare find for rainbow cakes!) Never fails to lift a smile on my face :)
3
We had the lobster roll and OTT coffee avocado milkshake. Both were delicious. The lobster roll is great value for money as you get a whole lobster for $28. The milkshake is truly a decadent treat and whilst pricey for a milkshake, it's very filling and can constitute a small meal by itself. Our biggest gripe is the wait time. We had to wait for everything. It was a 20 minute wait for the lobster roll itself and then we waited for them to respond to things like clearing the table, preparing the milkshake and bringing the bill. Service was slow despite the restaurant being half full and available service staff walking around
4
We went to Benjamin for the Monstruous Milkshake after eyeing the photos from instagram.Unfortunately, we felt 'FULL' in the stomach by only seeing the humongous milkshake. LOL!We saw the bed platter for two is a good option, then we just tried our luck.Oh my, oh my! It's sooo goood! And they really gave us lots of things with an affordable price!Tastewise? No complain at all!Very recommended!

Located in a mall that wasn't as popular and known. A little bit like a deserted place I guess? Menus were printed paper, possibly for effect. But I noticed sticky stains on some pages and some were crumpled or folded. Not the best menu Spoilt for choices but went ahead with "black and white", and "old school" I think. Concept is great, with all of that going on above the shake. I'm not sure if the focus was all on the top till they neglected the taste of the actual shake. Because I think even McDonalds milkshakes do better than this. Eating the top and having everything fall apart is a little annoying and messy. Price wise was pretty bad actually. Close to SGD$40 for 2 small shakes. May come back for a try for the actual food, but definitely not for the shakes.
4
the milkshakes there are literally them most photogenic beverage you will ever have. its a looot though to try to get one per 2 people! i recommend the cookie one! they taste amazing and are beautifully designed! if you are close by you should definitively drop by!
5
Recently, my two kids and I visited the restaurant for dinner. The service was top notch as well as the food. The menu had a variety of items and came out hot and delicious! The shakes are to die for! We will be back!
3
If you feel like having a milkshake that's heavier than a serving of cake this is the place to go.
We had the milo dinosaur milkshake and the salted caramel cake. The cake was disappointing, dry and the cream heavy and synthetic tasting.
4
Order pork chop and ocean plate. The place is packed. The pork chop is quite thick slice and tender. The ocean plate has salmon, big prawn, risotto. Quite tasty.
4
Had the degustation menu which had a escargot as appetizer, a choice of risotto (had the chili crab), a shot of watermelon juice, a choice of roll (had lobster roll) and tiramisu - for $35. It was good! The other good my friends had was the chucky beef on hot plate and chicken enchiladas which was good too. Will return :)
1
I heard this place was great and I have often seen queues outside. Got the chance to go there for a Saturday brunch and was hugely disappointing. I have the feeling it has changed hands but the food was the worst quality I have had in Singapore anywhere. Maybe the focus is on fancy milkshakes & cakes now, who knows. Sorry there are too many quality places to even think about giving this place a 2nd chanc
3
Cake was the attention grabber and it was displayed outside. So we just went for cakes and coffee. Love the ambiance of the shop. It was full so service was slightly slow, but i wasn't bothered. The cake was good, as delicious as it looks. I was happy
3
Dinner for two, had the fish and chips, partner had the Mac and cheese. I didn't really enjoy the fish and chips, felt like cheap fillets which were from the package and just heated up. The dessert was truly the only highlight of the month. Delicious and sweetness overload! Came once for the experience but that's prolly it!
3
I went with three friends to try out the OTP milkshakes that come with the special topping on top. My friend ordered the Nutella milkshake and she was very impressed! I ordered a Tim tam milkshake. It was delicious and looked just the like the pictures but was very expensive at $16! We also orders truffle fries, it was a nice sharing portion but at bit steep at $15. It is definitely worth going to try it out! I would probably go again but just for a milkshake.
4
Unique Shakes in Singapore! This one is called " The old School " is a vanilla milkshake with cookies, cotton candy , Nutella, cake and if you are lucky you will get a huge and crispy Durian "cookie like", all serve in a jar.You have other choices too.Very Yum
4
Very nice restaurant in a very cute setting.Definitely a bit pricey though, one bowl of spaghetti was like 30 Singapore Dollars!However, they do a good job decorating their food and the food there is delicious!I highly recommend the pastas and the milkshakes.Their service is a little slow, but the food is worth the wait.Love this place, but its quite pricey
4
The crabmeat linguine was superb! Love the Nutella banana milk shake too. Overall good experience...
3
Can't give a miss for their unique Nutella banana milkshake! Along with the truffle fries too! Staff were attentive and friendly.
2
many dishes were not available
Poor and slow service
But I would recommend to go for their beverages rather than their food.
I love the avocado coffee. They have many interesting and eyes-catching drinks...
4
The staff were friendly and quick to respond. Food was served fast and they tasted over expectations! Only thing is area could be bigger as it was pretty squeezy and we were barely there for an hr but we felt like there was a stress need to finish food fast and leave so it felt more like a quick diner than a place for ppl to really enjoy the food in peace.

This is my first time coming to Benjamin Browns as I saw this with my Girlfriend from Facebook. We were excited about coming until we were suddenly shifted to another table; with the reason being that they need the table. We ordered the over-the-top shake and it requested it to come after out meal. Sadly, it came to us before the starter was served. Literally we had desserts first before out salad. We are very disappointed that so many food are OOS at just around 6pm as we wanted to try other food.. Overall food is fine, but service is really very bad.
1
Was recently there. Terrible service. The short old man with spiky hair was incredibly rude when we asked for a table and extra chair. But extremely polite to Caucasians. Haha. Colonial hangover. A big sized waitress there was totally blur. When we had ordered and wanted to add another dish I called her over and asked for a Fish and Chips. We had ordered the spaghetti and pancakes. She came over and when I ordered she said "another fish and chips". I said "No. Just add one Fish and Chips to our already placed order". She did not note it down and walked off to clear a table. I was not sure if it registered in her pea brain or not. So I ordered via someone else. Another tall young man working there wearing specs was totally unsmiling and seemed moody. In fact all of the staff were like that. Except for Josephine who was great. Many thanks to her. Other silly things happened. Our food came. No cutlery or plates were on the table. We had to wait and ask and wait for it. The old man walked around topping up water but did not top up the water on our table. And he walked right past us. Basically the staff were unfriendly and not customer aware. Except for Josephine. Food was so so. Nothing to stand up on the table and scream about. There was a lady behind the bar counter who just looked around wide-eyed and scanning the crowd. Again unsmiling and with a demeanor of someone who just attended a funeral. Not stepping in to help or fix anything. She can't be the owner as she displayed no ownership. Basically I get better service from the man collecting 20 cents at hawker centre toilets. Much better service. You have been warned. Cheers.
3
Would definitely recommend going to try our their over the top milkshakes!Other than that, do not expect amazing food or great/quick service. It is far from that. Be prepared to wait!! We had to wait about 30 mins for a table and 15 mins for a milkshake
2
atmosphere was pretty okay but service was slow. maybe they didn't have enough people on shift that day. it took them quite awhile to clear our table because we didn't wanna sit at the table they reserved for us. waiting time for the food was okay but turns out that the set we ordered (fish & chips-$23++) still had the fishy weird taste. we ordered the cookies and cream over the top shake too. it was quite nice but not cold at all. but thankfully we had the 1 for 1 on entertainer app or else this is totally not worth paying for
1
Most of the things we ordered were OOS, we were there on a Friday evening around 7pm. I mean the kitchen should have prepared more foods for a Friday night right? Not to mention we were there to celebrate birthday, so it was very disappointing. Also, our steaks were served COLD.... Lastly, we ordered their signature milkshake together with mains, the waitress didn't ask whether to serve now or after our mains. In the end, the milkshake was served 1 hour earlier than our mains. Excellent.
4
My friends posted many photos of Benjamin Brown's over the top milkshakes in Instagram. I was quite curious about how good their milkshakes are. Friends told me it was worth every sip, so I purposely went to Singapore and tried the famous over the top milkshake.My friend and I arrived at 12:30noon. We saw few customers dining. There were two staffs serving.We ordered:-Waffle with berries & vanilla ice cream(It was nice, waffle was not that sweet. Suits my palate well.)-Sausage Platter (They served generously)-Cafe latte (Nothing to brag, just a normal latte)-Old school vanilla milkshake (Exquisite taste! Love every bit of it. Sweetness was just nice and it was really worth the calories) Price: S$16Overall, our experience in this cafe was good. Food was great, especially the waffle. I will definitely come back to try their nutella banana milkshake (friends' recommendation).
5
The steak and the meat are very affordable yet very tasty. The milkshakes are not just beverages but they also double as dessert (lots of sweets and goodies on top of the milkshake...it was so mesmerizing...must try!). I will definitely go back to this restaurant.
4
Dropped by for an afternoon takeaway coffee. Was extremely happy with the quality, the best I have had in Singapore to date.

Benjamin Browns underwent a minor revamp a few months ago and reopened as The Benjamins. The menu has been fine tuned and now includes several new items that deserve special mention. Their Canadian pork chop was cooked to a tender perfection and was served over a sweet potato mash. Possible one of the best pork chop I've ever had! The seafood aglio we ordered had a generous mix of scallops, prawns, squids tossed with a good portion of aromatic garlic and chopped chili for the right amount of kick. Pasta lovers who want to try something different can order their very unique chicken lemak chili padi pasta with bacon. It was slightly spicy but oh so yummy!! If you still have room for dessert, try one of their OTT (over the top) milk shakes that has taken instagram by storm. We tried one of their newest flavors -- the Tim Tam shake. It was a work of art! We were there at about 7pm on a weekday and waited about 15mins for a table. The restaurant isn't very big so reservations are definitely recommended (especially for bigger groups). Unfortunately reservations are not accepted for weekends. It's not a place I'd go for a long, leisurely meal but it's got a nice cafÃ© vibe for a quick get-together with friends
2
I ordered the beef chunks and the famous milkshakes. The beef was thick and chewy and I had a difficult time dissecting the beef into edible size pieces. I have tasted much better beef before so I wouldn't recommend it. The service was very poor indeed. They have a poor system of allocating seats to walk in customers as they leave almost the entire cafe to reservations. We had to be rushed to finish our food to allow other customers to dine in. Despite the inconvenience we experienced I would say the waiters were polite the entire time
1
I went because I saw their milkshakes on Instagram and they looked so good! Sadly the milkshake was so bad. Should be called a "watershake" because I couldn't taste any ice cream of milk. I got the vanilla over the top milkshake, which had cotton candy and some biscuits and whipped cream as topping. The cotton candy was good but the whipped cream tasted spoiled. I also had the carbonara spaghetti. It was just okay. Service was mediocre. Nothing special. Not super friendly. They seated groups of 2 in tables of 4 (2 tables pushed together) which was inconvenient because even though there were plenty of open seats, we had to wait to be seated. Definitely not going agai

Had a great time at benjamin browns! Service was great and the food was delicious! A must to drink their milkshake with on the tops!! And do remember to reserve a table in advance because i came previously but could not get a seat in view of long queue.
1
Space is pretty cramped up there. And the worst dining experience came when my order took like almost 1 hour to arrive and it's a simple aglio olio. Thought maybe they forgot my order so i reminded them for a total of 3 times! In addition one of the waiter totally ignore me when i called for them to ask about my food, he walked past and told me "wait i need to attend to others". What kind of service is this? This will be my last time here and i think my dining experience is totally spoiled especially i was pretty excited to try their food. Most of the food we wanted to order were also out of stock. It's the worst dining experience i ever had

Restaurants in shopping malls and food courts can be somewhat of a risk - you can get everything from great to gross. Benjamin Brown's Bistro looks quite nice and "bistroish" from the outside, and also from the inside (the fact that it's too cramped is another notorious feature of these kind of restaurants). If you feel like having a nice breakfast or a good coffee, you probably won't pass this place.They have a rather suitable and tempting menu list which enticed us to order a couple of juices, teas and different dishes to share. Service was not unfriendly but rather uninterested, and unfortunately she managed to confuse our order on her (7-metre)walk back to the kitchen. The restaurant is great for people who are happy with consecutive delivery: not one single order (not even the drinks) were brought together to our table.The beverages were good, really good. The food between average and subterrestrial: beef was just a chewy chunk of tendons and fat - not fantastic. The (really slow and easily overwhelmed) service was at least "thankful" for the feedback, when we finally managed to pay the bill. So next time maybe just a coffee (never tried it, but rumour is it is good) and some brownies (they looked quite delicious in the showcase)
2
I was hoping to get a seat quickly as I was in need of a bite but as the sign says to wait to be seated, I obediently did. Unfortunately, no one looked my way and so, being the patient sort; I waited. Besides, there was a couple in front of me and I did not want to move in front of them.I found out shortly after that the couple was merely wanting to sample the Chinese New Year goodies on display but ended up not getting anything.By then, I had no choice but to signal to a staff member who, did not approach me to show me to a seat but instead nodded his head and expected me to show myself in. I did so anyway.I sat down but did not ask for the menu deliberately. It did not take long before I received it. May I suggest letting the customers know of the soup of the day or any items that are not specifically named on the menu.As it turns out, the soup of the day was cream of broccoli. It was different from other soups I have tasted as the consistency was not creamy but crunchy from the broccoli. Good job for innovation.In conclusion, repeat customers do not come back solely because of the food but also the service rendered.

We stopped by Benjamin Browns because we happened to be in the area and nearby cafes didn't seem all that enticing. How delighted we were to find such a well-lit and pleasant bistro. The entrees were delicious. Our fish and chips and salad were some of the best we had ever tasted. The service was prompt and gracious as well. We will certainly return to this corner of Singapore at the Forum again the next time we are in the area
