Probably the best Authentic Hainanese Chicken Rice in Singapore cooked and managed by Hainanese.
Their chicken rice is authentic. Very tender chicken, be it steamed, roasted or soya sauced with awesome Chilli and ginger paste.
Their staffs is friendly and gives a warm welcoming.

I must say... Chicken Rice is one of the most common dishes in Singapore. Not only can we boast to have the best Chicken Rice in South East Asia, i can say we can get the most consistent taste trueout our many outlets. This Chicken Rice Restaurant is one of my Favourites. How did they get my attention? Their Ginger Sause with their Steamed Chicken is simply one of a kind. They have perfected it and guys...trust me...u can never find this taste anywhere in SG. I am a Foodie...i cook and i eat. But guys...this is a must try.... From small stall to a restuarant... Unusual Chicken gets my 2 Thumbs Up

This is without a doubt, Singapore's best if we consider the consistency, taste and tenderness of the chicken, soup, ginger, chili, service and most importantly, the price!!! Although we are prepared to pay a premium for good food, this is really good chicken rice at a reasonable price. The roast meat is also super. And, all prepared in-house. Hope it stays this way especially knowing that hawkers often cut corners once they are famous.
