Enjoyed dinner here. Had the crab - with the egg sauce. It was delicious, messy and not spicy. Could have had the spicy version as well. Others in the restaurant were enjoying a very delicious looking 'Mr Big' steam boat full of seafood. Will get this next time. Though it will feed 3-4 people. We also had a good pork dish and fried rice

The best part of this restaurant is that it offers very differently flavoured dishes. Ginger + Lime, Lychee grilled, Mango styled grilled fish, curry fish, Grilled fish with tomatoes, Sour & Spicy fish, Black pepper, Sichuan, Salted Egg Crab, hot pot, cold/hot noodles and the list is endless. The fish is served in a pot at your table and plugged in, so will stay warm
