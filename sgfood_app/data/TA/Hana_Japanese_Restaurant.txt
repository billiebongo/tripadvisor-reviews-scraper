Staff can be more proactive. We ordered a chili crab flying udon to share and there's no serving spoon given. That really surprised me!
1
Ordered the $88 omakase set. Not traditional Japanese omakase at all- they gave dishes like smoked duck salad. Totally unexpected.
5
The flying udon is unique n delicious! Cheese maki is addictive, overall the service is good, the ambience is nice
4
Interesting style of food but quite expensive. It can get very crowded at dinner and weekends. Be prepared to wait.
4
Food was good and service staff was very friendly and helpful. A little bit pricey as the portion was not huge.
5
The flying noodles was interesting and so was the special maki....However, the price was a little on the steep side
4
the alcoholic drink, dream catcher is a must try..Food wasn't too bad but definitely, imstagram worthy
4
We've heard about the 'flying' noodles and other instagram-worthy moments. Hearing is not as authentic as visiting. And visit we did. For the four of us, we ordered the omakase (sashimi), the flying soba (soft shell crab version), the 3x3 grid box plus heaps of conversations. Washed down by hot green tea.In short a lovely, pretty decorative meal was had. The phone camera also busied itself. However, we felt it was a tad expensive per person but clearly the weekend crowds testify that it is Japanese food done/presented right. Prohibitive pricing aside, repeat visits can be anticipated as we will check out the other pleasant delectables
5
We tried the 4x3 box set and it was well presented with sashimi, tempura, steam eggs, sushi, and few other items. Lobster salad is well executed too. Lastly the Premium snow ball is sushi rice topped with minced tuna, flounder sashimi and loads of uni. Well worth the price I think. Will come back again to try other stuff.
5
We ordered quite a lot of dishes for 2 pax. 1 flying noodles (chilli crab sauce), 1 3X3 grid, 1 fire maki and 1 matcha-misu.And they were all delicious and we ended up too bloated.The flying noodles were surprisingly good as compared to what the others had reviewed on. The sauce was abit spicy but is yummy with the noodles. The 3X3 grid was pretty and nice but 1 of the grid served is ginger which made me felt like my money is wasted. but generally still ok with the quality and taste of the food.Fire maki with raclette cheese was more of for aesthetic and instagram pic/video. Nothing very fantastic but if u like cheese and ebi, can get this. For the matcha-misu, it was a nice dessert and twist from the traditional tiramisu..Overall, an enjoyable experience. We tried the alcohol drink (Dream catcher or sth). It was a mixture of passionfruit and apply juice with rum. There is 2 funnels, 1 with the rum and 1 with the juice. You can choose to add how much alcohol into the glass. but we totally underestimated the amount of rum (thought it was little) but ended up our juice were not enough to cover e rum taste. But they have an option of mixing the drink n rum tgt. But it was fun.
4
Very impressed with the food presentation and the quality of food was great too. Nice ambience in general. The maki and chirashi bowl tasted nice too! Prices are on the steeper side but quite worthwhile overall.
3
Interesting menu items but some do not match up to standard. A little too overpriced for the quality
4
The food has been served in a different ways. Drinks with special effect! Food with unique plates . Staff are very friendly . Prices are expensive
3
Standard of service crew wasn't very consistent. Cancelled one of the items but it was still served. Their signauture flying noodles wasn't worth the hype as the noodles were overcooked and the Chili crab sauce wasn't what was expected of a "Chili crab sauce". However, their unagi bowl and sushi tacos made the dinner a pleasant one. It came with a stack of eel, which made it worthwhile. Their taco sushi was quite an interesting combination and we enjoyed both dishes.
5
We had a hankering for nigiri sushi while staying at the very nearby Hilton hotel. I found this place using TripAdvisor so adding to the accolades as I'd highly recommend this as a well-priced casual restaurant for tasty Japanese. All the fish was fresh and delicious and we enjoyed all the types of sushi we tried (nigiri, maki, handroll) and the karaage chicken was pretty good too. The wine selection by the glass is confined to one white and one red choice, which could be improved (esp. if you prefer chardonnay over sav blanc). While we sipped on sake, our neighbours ordered an array of showstopper drinks and dishes that were brought to the table with smoke and dry ice (there is your usual fare as well as a few modern twists and specials). On talking to them, they are locals and their friends highly recommended the restaurant. They were snapping so many photos and selfies that they even had to get out of their chairs to get the right angle. All round adding to our evening's entertainment. Photo attached is of one of our neighbour's drinks called "bubblebath".

We visited Singapore on holidays and friends took us to this restaurant. After reading all the reviews on here, had some ideas but still did not prepare us for what was to come. We went with children and must say they were probably the happiest customers that day. They loved the flying noodles (signature dish) as well as the flaming cheese on sushi, can't remember what it was called. Some may say it is all about gimmicks/presentation and that but the taste was actually very good. The sushi and sashimi were fresh and tasty that the grown up kids enjoyed them too. Yes, you probably won't be going back weekly but definitely worth at least a visit surely and a great place to take friends to. We don't live in the country but will definitely go again if we ever return. Perfect for meeting friends for a catch up and children are definitely welcome so suitable for family meals out to

I had a good dinner at Hana , which offers creative Japanese options at reasonable prices. I started with a negitoro maki which was quite good, the tuna was of good quality. The avocado and unagi hand roll was very tasty as well. Then i tried my hand at a couple of creative dishes- the soft shell crab tacos consisted of deep fried soft shell crab on rice in a hard shell taco with sushi rice, lettuce and a mayonnaise sauce. It was ok - I would say the lettuce was a bit of an impostor and there could be been more toppings which would have made it more interesting. The birthday chirashi was a creative combination of ebi , tuna, spicy mayo salmon and tobiko along with egg- the fish was very fresh and the flavors worked nicely together. There is a broad range of options on the menu, from many different chirashis, sushi, maki, sashimi, noodles, rice bowls, sushi tacos, and also small dishes which you can order to get some of their creations. There is wine available by bottle or glass, sake and also draft Asahi, which runs about 10 SGD for a small glass. Service is fast and friendly. No need for a reservation as it was fairly open when I got there at ~630

Had been here before but the menu has changed! Its new menu was surprisingly tasty, fresh and wonderful. Had their 4x3 grid menu. Even the bits on the board taste great. Its chocolate! The neighbors had cold somen presented uniquely on a stick. They had cheese poured to a sushi roll. Bizarre presentation. It smells good but didn't dare ask the neighbors! Next time..
4
Food was novel and interesting, tastes were good and we all enjoyed the different dishes we ordered. The ordering processes and food descriptions were a little confusing even on the english menu. The disappointment was the timing of food delivery. There was no table coordination with one meal arriving so early that it was finished before others arrived. Meal delivery for table spread out over 15-20 minutes. Would go back for the food but delivery needs to be improved
4
Impressed with the creativity of food and drinks presented, is refreshing. Food is good and tasty. The cold noodles and cheese maki were favourites. If you have a big appetite, be prepared to spend above $60pp. Will be back for more ... to try other dishes.
5
Very good service and food was delicious! The sashimi was fresh and succulent while the udon was very nicely presented. Will definitely be back again.
5
Ambience was good, food served was moderately fast. Most importantly, quality of food was as good as last visit!
5
The staffs were friendly and knows what to recomend to us in terms of variety and quantity.
The food are nice and fresh.
5
The staff were so friendly and even help to customise our order to satisfy our crave for jap cuisine. And of cos the food served by the Chef is unique and delicious. Highly recommended!
4
Visited Hana on a quiet weekday. Pretty good food choices and options available. Loved the salted egg yolk sauce with fried options. It was such a good creamy and yummy sauce. Sushi was also done well. Loved the variety provided on the menu!
5
We visited hana after seeing pictures of the flying noodles & it was definitely worth the visit! Very cool and creative food as well as such fresh, delicious sushi! Great staff also!
2
Food ordered: "Flying Noodle" Truffle Somen (S$20++)If eating food means consuming an "instagrammable" masterpiece, then by all means, head down to Hana for it.After coming back here 1 year later, I'm still not impressed by the quality of the food.Novelty can only impress me so far, and I was thoroughly disappointed by the "flying" noodles that accompanied the dish.It's akin to eating cold mee sua dipped in truffle oil sauce (which was the only saving grace). Advisable not to sit at the back of the restaurant. There was visible soot in the air and a stench of reused oil emanating from the kitchen. Probably come during its non-peak hours.
4
If you are looking for something different, Hana has a lot to offer. Definitely worth trying once or bring visitors to due to its innovative dishes such as flying noodles and cheese raclette. Food was good (not amazing or extraordinary), creativity is highly commended, and good service is always a plus!
3
First time to Hana, creative presenting the food in the flying noodles. The somen very well executed. However disappointed with the chirashi, expected more freshness with the price paid. Had the 4X3 platter, items served were pretty ordinary, nothing to rave about.Hana is a place to impress and get impressed if you have celebrating an occasion.
4
The atmosphere was really good, beautiful deco with a conducive noise level. Waiters were friendly and knew the menu well, non-pressurizing and gives great recommendations. Food was really really good and extremely creative/instagrammable, the matcha-misu, platter were all great. But the flying soba can be better in terms of texture
3
Visited Hana with really high hopes because of all the photogenic pictures that we saw online. Turned out to be really disappointing as the noodles were bland. Food weren't fantastic in general. Nonetheless, the noodles were definitely Instagram worthy.
5
The food was not only delight also surprising due to the flavors. Highly recommend the salmon cheese Chirashi and kani salad. Noodles we're I'm also very good.
3
With fancy presentation and ok food I will not highly recommend this place. The food is really ok except the sushi. We have order almost everything recommended to us. Not a great option for Japanese.
5
We found this restaurant by fluke and what an amazing surprise it was. The flying soba noodles were unusual and we ordered the 3x4 bento type box and the dream maker drink with dry ice. We found it very colourful and a wonderful surprise for all the senses. We strongly would recommend it
3
I heard about this HANA Japanese resturant some years but really didn't have a reason to travel all the way for the food. My Friend recommended us to try this as it was around 1 pm when we thought of having lunch. We saw the flying soba display and thought it was interesting to give it a try. Though resturant is not packed, we choose to sit at the counter to see how the young Chefs were at work. The only plus point is the presentation of the flying soba and how they arranged the soba and they serve 2 types of sauces. I prefer the sauce with a full eye beaten into it. It was refreshing as singapore is a very warm day. I didn't want to have spam maki and thus the Chef offer to change it for me for a standard Carlifornia maki instead. The set is just good for a simple lunch. As for the 3 by 3 bento set. The presentation was innovative. I tried the truffle charashi but was not impressed as I don't really like truffle oil and prefer my charashi cooked in traditional full body taste and broth. Suggest they improve on the taste on the tempura- this is too normal ( singaporean and not Japanese ) Will I come again ? Maybe to bring my family to try something that is presentation talking point only.
5
My wife & I, being first-timers at this restaurant, were amazed by the quality of the food & totally blown away by the service level of the staff.Desmond & his staff were very attentive to our dining needs & needed no prompting in service.To top it all, they surprised my wife with a birthday cake & transformed a wonderful evening into a perfect one !
4
Hana attracts a nice crowd during the evenings and there are a few popular dishes. It's " flying noodles with dry shrimp", is a must have as is the Sushi with hot chili crab sauce. Food is served gradually. Tables are a tad small but its fusion Japanese food is nice to the local palate. Overall, a different approach to Japanese cuisine
5
Impeccable service and an extensive menu that comprises of lunch bowls, sushi tacos, grid boxes (an assortment of food in small boxes), speciality maki and their iconic flying noodlesbut the Flying Cha Soba with Spam Maki (Classic green tea soba, served with Osen Egg sauce. Plus point: Spam Sushi) was the favourite among the family although I really liked the seafood fried rice more. You wouldnâ€™t expect to get tacos in a Japanese restaurant besides sushi so it was surprising to find it on the menu. This is made with a piece of tortilla folded around sushi ingredients
1
Visited due to the hype of 'flying noodles' and it wasn't worth the tastebuds. I waited for the place to open for the dinner shift and the manager was busy on the phone and said that he needs the table back by a certain time. So we were seated and I knew what I wanted to order which was a huge lot and got the 'flying' soba with the salted egg yolk sauce and somen with truffle sauce. If you eat a lot of jap food, you'd know a good soba sauce and it is not present here. The salted egg yolk sauce was too thick for a sauce. Apart from that I also ordered sushi, sashimi and oysters.The sushi came in clear plastic stair looking drawers. The taste of the raw fish wasn't pleasant and the rice was terrible too. The price paid for this is just for having the same sushi in every drawer (mainly salmon and maguro). There was a piece of tamago but it was a bad store bought one. Needless to say if the fish used for sushi was bad, so was the sashimi. The only thing that was okay were the oysters
4
When I stepped into Hana Japan restaurant, I being welcomed by the friendly staff. When the staff was taking the order, she even recommend me on the food that most customers ordered. I am fancinated by the flying noodle and can't resist taking photos. It really taste good. The garlic rice taste fantastic too. Not forgetting the Over The Top drink. It's very refreshing. I will visit Hana restaurant again to try on other food and desserts too
3
The craze of floating noodles has died down. Nonetheless decided to try. Note floating noodles are served cold. The udon with salted egg dip is not bad and dip is refillable, but truffles soba is a let down.
3
Great experience and would advise small eater to share the flying soba/somen as is quite big portion. Good place to treat friends on special occasion as price is quite ex for normal dining
4
Second visit and the food never disappoint me.. I'll be back.. Premium sashimi contains different fishes belly part, is good.. Sushi is nice too
4
The flying truffle somen was really eye opening. However the somen didn't taste as good as I thought. I could smell the truffle but couldn't taste much of it. I prefer the soft shell crab maki. It was tasty.
4
Excellent seared beef steak with rice, mentai salmon roll and cold flying cha soba noodles . Very busy at meal times - best to do a reservation to ensure seats .
5
Didn't have any queue when I reach around 6.45pm on a Wednesday.. I order lots to eat..Of cos the signature salted egg flying udon.. Its just noodle and salted egg sauce so remember to order some meat or sushi! If not it would be too rich to eat more.. Quite a big portion would be just nice for 2 pax.I order the 4x3 platter! Everything is good!! Love it.. The food I love the most is the seafood chawanmushi! Must try comes with a real crab claw prawn and scallop!Check out my photos :
4
Food was good. Floating noodles was delicious. Had it with truffle dip. What was the highlight though was the chef special - ebi maki with raclette cheese. Absolutely delicious. I would go back for that and to try the other dishes I was unable to this round as there were only 2 of us and we could not order too much. Service was very cheerful and helpful. Generally very attentive.Better to make reservations to avoid disappointment. The restaurant fill/ up very quickly once it opens its doors at 6pm for dinner
5
If you are in Singapore, and you have not tried Singapore Flying Noodle, visit this place now. Ordered two flying noodles, one maki and one plate of shashimi. Lunch was awesome there. Hana Restaurant is located in Forum Shopping Mall, Orchard Road. Go impress your friend with a bowl of flying noodle. :
2
If you want to go, make a reservation.Hyped for floating instaworthy noodles - taste was ok, but the service was so bad I don't plan to go back. They made us wait one hour with half of the restaurant being empty. The person at the entrance was extremely rude and incompetent, he even tried to split our group despite having other available tables. The rest of the staff were all nice and friendly.The salted egg dip sauce for the noodles was very tasty, and the maki were good. The other noodles dip sauces tasted very artificial. Spent about 30SGD sharing 2 noodles, 2 maki and pork cutlet with 6 girls
5
To be honest, it didn't occur to me to make reservation. It was amazing that it was almost full house 15 minutes after it opened at 6:00pm. And fortunately we had managed to get seats at the counter. The services were impeccable and the service crew was attentive to our needs (even before we voiced out!). In addition, the food was delightful :) It was a good experience to eat the flying noodles. :
4
I enjoyed the dining experience. Finally get to try this place. Food quality is good amd service can be slightly improved. But overall good experience
3
The food is soso.. the food pricing is a bit expensive. All the food there is quite good for instagraming.
3
Good place for some Instagram-worthy pictures of your food. However not very worth the money & taste of food were merely average.
4
Waiter didn't key our order in, waited for 30-40min for the food. Service too slow. Overall food is good.
5
Had the Agedashi Tofu & several types of nigiri it was amazing
I saw a lot of food coming from the kitchen that I need to come back and try
4
Ambience: GreatFood Presentation is marvelous. Service may be slow for a while due to peak period,had to call for bill at least 3 times before being entertained.However, the server knows her product well, recommended Sushi Taco while we were deciding whether to give it a try.Price, reasonable for gastronomic and Visual
4
Lovely food & drink presentation Highly recommend:Salted Egg Yolk Flying UdonDeluxe Sashimi PlatterPiTan with Sushi RollLobster Mayo Taco3 x 3 GrindService Average as slow because shortage of manpower. So visit when you are free and no appointment which you need to rush off
1
Service was not good, we made reservation yet were requested to wait.We were sitting at the back end corner, waiters hardly see and respond to out request.We requested to refill green tea, but is either very slow, or they only refill 2 cups out of 3, is the 3rd cup transparent to them?The truffle noodle, was not up to expectation
2
There was a miscommunication between chope and restaurant, went there and stated i made a booking under chope but there was no records. Luckily i got my table nevertheless. Long wait for food. They were seriously understaffed. They mixed up our order/bill with the table besid
4
Very good service: Water was constantly refilled without asking. Waitress very familiar with the menu & gave genuine recommendations (as opposed to recommending only expensive items). Attentive waitstaff.Food: They went the extra mile with presentation. Food was tasty, unfortunately I felt the portion was not enough (IMHO very common occurrence for local restaurants). Left the restaurant and went somewhere else for round two. Price: 2 mains + 1 side = $70+. I thought this was not value for money.Overall: Would come here once or twice for their novelty dishes but to patronise regularly is unlikely
4
The service and ambience was good, and I tried the pork katsu rice. The rice was fragrant and pork was tender. Great place to chill with friends.
4
The food is nice, but it was quite average for the price. Some items were interesting but overall some things can be improved. sushi came not so cold which affected the enjoyment abit.
but overall still good!
4
Tried the omakase special Mondays, extra ordinary value with nice food and amazing with the price tag.
5
the moment we enter the restaurant, the service staffs were attentive to our needs. didn't have to wait long for food to be served. sashimi were fresh, and the kutobuta salad was great! worth the spending!
3
Shady ambience, more of a bar than a restaurant but not in a nice way.
Service is on par. Overall, I suggest they lighten up the environment and reduce msg/soy sauce input...
3
I ordered their lunch set (which is available also on the weekends, yay to that) and it was worth every single cent that I have spent on. Their sashimi was absolutely delicious and fresh.
5
Food beautifully presented...santen chirashi is simply gorgeous......
Service level is courteous and friendly
5
Food is also very fresh & nicely prepared. Great selection of sake & their home brewed umeshu is a must try!
3
We tried Omakase 1 for 1 using the Entertainer app. There are altogether 8 courses, of which, love the Sashimi, Shusi and Salmon Grill; silver fish and eggs stew is salty. Staffs there are friendly and helpful. Overall experience are good.
5
I saw the advert for the $30 Omakase set and I thought what a gimmick! I called them up last minute and asked if the deal was real and they said yes - no special conditions for a Sunday night. We went - nice place. Obviously the food ingredients is NOT the same as those $180 places but it was still VERY good. The sashimi or grilled salmon alone would have been worth minimum $20 at any other restaurant much less to be only one of the six courses. Even after that, the food kept coming with stewed eggplants and the plum rice wish mekajiki sashimi was EXTREMELY good! Come end July there will be a new omakase menu so the menu does keep changing
5
We enjoyed the food very much and the impeccable service made the whole experience even better. It's not too crowded, so that makes a perfect place for gathering. Will recommend to my friends and will be back again!
2
The service staff was nice. But the food quality is not great. I was especially disappointed by the type of rice used.
4
The staff even went the extra mile to get us an ice lemon tea from the cafe two doors down.
We ate the Wagyu beef. Wow, just mouth wateringly tender.
3
Underwhelmed by the chef who forgot our amaebi in the chirashi don and served them separately.Also surprised by the staff who asked if we are using the Entertainer app upfront when we ordered 2 special chirashi sets. Food was also not as amazing as I seen online
5
Was at the restaurant last week for a business lunch and was pleasantly surprised to see Chef Ivan there. Ordered the Omakase and was not disappointed. The fish was very fresh and the menu well balanced covering different elements from both the sushi counter and hot kitchen. You should definitely order their plum wine as an aperitif, it was very refreshing and helped set the palate for the meal ahead. The price was very reasonable for a Omakase meal along Orchard Road
5
I agree service could be better but Iris the hostess is great at helping with the communication gap. My daughter and I loved the food here so much we came back 3 times for lunch. It's consistently good and very convenient to the Hilton hotel where we were staying. I would only come if you are nearby as is located in a mall. No great ambiance but will leave satisfied.
3
Had the Sushi Kaiseki set using the Entertainer app. Restaurant was half empty on a Saturday evening. Ambience was pretty nice. Similar deco and feel to an Izakaya in Japan. Wait staff were attentive but weren't briefed or trained, maybe with the exception of one who was able to make a suggestion or two. The food in the set was ok. Started with a small vege and soy bean appetizer. This was nice. Then came the sashimi. Included a botan ebi which was ok. They gave u the raw head first then took it back to deep fry with batter if requested. Too bad the batter was kinda thick and unrefined. But at least the sashimi was relatively fresh, though I've definitely had better at a similar price range. The chawanmushi with truffle was my favorite. This was really yummy and the egg consistency was perfect. Miso soup was good. Hard to be spectacular for miso soups I guess. The sushi, which was meant to be the star of the set, was disappointing. The sushi rice was squished way too much resulting in a dense cuboidal mass and somehow the cuts of fish just wasn't tasty. The sushi was similar to those you get at cheap conveyor belt type restaurants like Sakae Sushi or the likes. Dessert was a simple scoop of yuzu ice cream which was nice and refreshing. Since we took the SK2 set (Sushi Kaiseki), it was $88++ for each set. Not cheap but not exorbitant either. But I felt it wasn't worth the price tag, considering the quality of the food. If I were craving for Japanese food and everywhere else was booked out, I probably will return. But otherwise I'd give Hana a miss.
3
First visit to the restaurant. Items are value for money . All lot of set meals for weekday. Don't ever order cold green tea cause it was so diluted. The service was really bad. Not being discriminating but one of the PRC staff was rude and unfriendly. Horrible service !!!
4
All of us ordered from the cooked dinner set & they are quite value for money. The service at Hana was also very good. We were there to celebrate a friend's birthday & the manager was very nice to offer the birthday boy 3 different flavors of ice-cream & even offered to help us cut the cake.
3
Tried this place for lunch today with the family. The weekday lunch sets are pretty good value, although a little on the small side. But some of the regular a la carte dishes are also quite good value. We had 2 lunch sets and 2 main menu items between the 4 of us, with some extra tempura, and it was plenty. Quality was ok for this price point. Service was a little slow but not unreasonably so
4
Service is excellent. The $30 omakase set is really value for money and they changed their menu monthly, it never failed to surprise you always.
3
Chirashi took an hour to arrive, waiter unfamiliar with menu. Restaurant not well ventilated for Bbq. Food was good, unfortunately overall experience makes it unlikely I'll return.
5
Omakase set is value for money. Staff was attentive and a quiet place for group/family gathering. Its my favourite Japanese restaurant now.
4
A good and decent Japanese restaurant that serves very nice Japanese cuisine, I would certainly recommend this place if you are looking for a affordable and cozy place for dining.
5
The Chef came out to share about the different grades of tuna sashimi and arburi sashimi. The sesame gravy tofu filled with salmon roe is an excellent choice. The chawamushi is filled with shark fin is another excellent dish. I liked the sushi spread and the clam soup is filled rich clam thick aroma. The food deco is exquisite and delicate. My overall experience is wonderful. The cost per person is $120. It is located on the first floor and there are limited carpark at a Forum Shopping Centre. Do give them a call to reserve your place. Check out my photo posting to see the delicious food spread.
2
I was there recently with my family and we ordered the chirashi deluxe set (2 sets @ $60 each) and the sushi platter (2 sets @ $80 each) and despite the high price paid I was given low quality and quantity food. If I went to Teppei the chirashi bowl costs half the price and better cuts and fresher sashimi. The sushi platter was 10 pieces of sushi consisting of middling quality sushi. Definitely won't go there again not even with a1 for 1 voucher. The only thing saving this place is that the wait staff is somewhat decent.
4
We visited Hana several times now. The sushi chef is very attentive and helpful. He always tries to give us the best and the freshest sushi. Especially good are the pike mackerel, sardine, scallop and sea urchin. Prices are very reasonable for Singapore. If you plan to eat sushi here, head directly to the bar and ask the chef for the recommendations. Enjoy
2
An indication of a good Japanese restaurant is always lots of Japanese patrons. Wh were there at lunch time, and ther was not a single Japanese in sight. In fact, including us, there were two tables.The food was really mediocre. Tempura batter was more of a fish and chips batter. However, they made up in quantity what they lacked in quality. Good size portions!As for service, the waiter was obviously from China and hardly spoke any English.I can't think of any reason to re-visit this restaurant, given the number of good Japanese restaurants in this city
3
We ordered the deluxe chirashi and as well as an ordinary one. Was surprised to find things like crab stick in a deluxe chirsashi that costs $60 ... Surprisingly they are almost identical apart from a couple of ingredients that I woundn't really shout about. Don't recall getting deluxe ingredients like uni or impressively fatty toro; I think there was toro in the latter but clearly not memorable. Also had a nice shabu shabu (wagyu). For the price they charge I think food does not taste bad but the ingredients disappoints a bit. They have several promotions going on that seem good value. Although the service was excellent. Never had such a good service in Singapore
2
Went to this place at forum shopping mall but was quite disappointed by the cooked food, esp e maki. Their signature maki was overwhelmed by the pickles (only can taste and one flat crunchy feel of the pickle and not the other ingredients). I guess this is more of a place for their shabu which I didn't try so I can only comment on their other dishes
