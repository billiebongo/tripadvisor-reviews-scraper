The menu is decent to satisfy one’s taste and the price is affordable. Only downside is the Long queue during peak hours.
2
This place is insanely popular. Not sure why. The service is non existent and the food is really very so so. We don’t quite know why anyone would come to eat here!
5
The meatball was delicious with strawberry jam aside on it. But they serve was no too hot. And also the buffalo wings was marvelous taste and soft when because the crispy.

I visited Ikea Alexandra to get some potted plants for the office. Ikea offers presentable and nice potted plants, household items like cutlery, bedding accessories at mostly affordable price.Ikea Cafeteria are always crowded during meal times and hence, if you got time, I would recommend to go before or after meals. The food served are mostly local to western and Swedish cuisines.I liked their smoke salmon and their chicken wings. Also highly recommended is their hot-dog bun - a great afternoon snack or on-the-go and most of all, cheap and good. You need to DIY putting the ketchup and mustard but I guess this is the fun part.Their rest of food in general are average and I would recommend to go only if you are near the vicinity
5
Since we are at ikea shopping, so decided to have some snacks.Ordered our usual, chicken wings (6 for $8), spring rolls, salmon set at $9.90, coffee at 50cents, lotus rice at $6.80 (its very delicious and portion is huge) Siew Mai at $2 for 4 pcs. Do avoid 12-1.30pm as it’s Super crowded and hard to find a table for big group. Overall, food is so delicious and it’s worth the wait
2
Though is value for money but staff did not manage the queue very well . People jumped queue while you queued up like a fool .Queued at least 20 minutes to get into the restaurant You need to queue up to 30 minutes to get you the popular dish n IKEA only allowed 2 hours per seating . 1/2 hour before they stopped topping up food . Overall food not too bad but dinning experience is poor . Think restaurant catered more than they could handled .

There are two Ikea in Singapore which is the Alexandra Road and Tampines. There is also free bus shuttle from MRTs like Pasir Ris MRT, Bedok MRT and Tampines MRT to Ikea Tampines. You can also refer to the bus schedule on the website to see the timing. This was my first time visiting and trying out the restaurant at Ikea in Singapore.At that time I went, it was a sunny weekday afternoon during the lunch hour. The place was crowded and pack with people. It took me about 15 mins to order and pay my food. I was really impress on the way Ikea uses trolley to carry the food to the table. This is a really good way to avoid spillage of the food. The Ikea food was very value for money and it taste really nice. One of the dishes that I like the most is the Swedish Meat balls. This dish is a must try dish when you eat at Ikea restaurant. The drinks available there are free flow. You can have free flow of coffee, tea and other soft drinks as well. To sum up everything, the food at Ikea is really worth going
2
Read so much about the changes to the restaurant especially the chicken wings. Halal and non-halal prepared not the same style. Rather tasteless for the non-halal. Most food looked bland including ours. Very limited choices for the halal section. Asked for a cup for my bottled water was told I had to pay for it. Seriously? Why can't they provide a disposable cup if they are worried we might steal soft drinks

IKEA Singapore has a wide variety of household needs from clothes storage to kitchen cabinets to chairs and more. It is also a place great for family with young children. Young children can play for up to 1 hour in the enchanted Swedish Forest while we shop at IKEA. After a long day shopping, it was rewarding to have a good meal at IKEA restaurant.IKEA Singapore all-time favourite Fried chicken wings. Crispy on the outside and soft on the side! It’s not deep fried, but oven-baked.Price: $1 for a pieceWe also ordered their signature meatballs, 15pcs $8.50. Spring rolls and a pastry. All sums up to a lovely easy going nice brunch for the day
4
One of my favorite place for meal and would sometimes visit the cafe rather to buy stuff from Ikea. Quite disappointed that they have removed their chicken wings from the menu. Best dishes I would recommend - Portuguese egg tarts, meatballs and their spring rolls. Parking is free but the cafe is always pack on weekends
4
Chicken wing was discontinued due to quality issue . But I had a beef cheek set n it was really well done n tasty . Usual free coffees tea for members .
5
We don't have Ikea in New Zealand and we really enjoyed our time there. Loved the food at the cafe! Amazing value!
2
Tried their meat balls again and it is still bad.
Food is worst that fast food places.
Maybe it is cheap that's why there is always a crowd.

Recently visited IKEA with my father for their Ramadan buffet which was priced at $19.90 per adult, where you could eat from 6 30pm-10pm with free flow soft drinks. The food selection was quite decent for the price we paid. As expected, the IKEA beef meatballs were present on the menu!! Their chicken rendang was fragrant and fried wings tasty. Would have hoped for their maggi goreng and fried rice to be more flavourful. Service at the buffet is impeccable, kudos to IKEA staff for being personable and likable. Staff clear your table before your plates clutter. The dessert section was great with a selection of malay kuehs, chocolate eclairs, swiss rolls and fruit cocktail mix, which all tasted rly good. The free flow drinks are unique as they have fruit flavoured water which some may find refreshing.We ordered off the ala carte menu as well. The chicken wings are pretty tasty. The butterscotch cookie is amazing as well. Cant say the same about their apple pie though.Overall, the food in IKEA is worth the money you pay and it is very simple to navigate through the process of ordering and paying. Its a perfect way to end your day there after a day of furniture hunting. Glad to see IKEA branching out towards other cuisines(asian) such as introducing nasi biryani sets
3
Yes their meatballs has shrunk, probably they find the need to make more money than usual, that is how I see it, instead of just a stop over for shoppers, their restaurant is a go to place for people that love their meatballs but apparently they see the need to make more. They don't serve the same sizes as what they used to, especially right after their renovation, they also renovated their meatball sizes IMHO
4
Food is quite lowly priced here. But options in fish, chicken is very limited. They have chicken wings, salmon and chicken chops apart from some cold salads in fish. You get varieties of cakes. If you have gone to IKEA for shopping then this is the best option
4
Went to IKEA Alexandra on my last visit in SG. Quite surprise with their menu..their nasi lemak is quit nice and cheap! It's only 4$! A good cup of coffee or tea for only 50 cent. A good choice to have a quick brunch before shopping in Anchorpoint Mall which is just across the roa
3
Decided to have dinner at IKEA Tampines after work. It was a Friday. The restaurant was packed. But things runs like clockwork. Qs were orderly and staff efficient. The chicken wings never fail to entice. Soft drinks were free flow. Also tried the Muslim section. Quite good. One flaw though is the restaurant is situated on the 3rd level and when Yiu are done eating, to get out, you have to go through the IKEA store, the displays and the market hall. This was a deliberate design in the layout to draw customers into the store.
3
Everything is self explanatory, no?I like the fact that they are making a big effort to reduce sugar in their drinks! See drink photo attached.Ohh and I didn't know that they also eat "lor mai kai"(lotus leaf chicken glutinous rice) in Sweden!! And my wife said it tasted very Swedish indeed!
5
Ikea has it in for families, taking care of kids while their parents shop around for housing products. And after getting what they need, the cafeteria with its reasonable pricing and a menu full of yummy treats like the meatballs and delicious chicken wings wld fill us up. And before we leave for the day, satisfied with our meal and purchases, we would most probably join the kids as we indulge in an ice cream cone because, why not? Value for money and IKEA takes care of its customers. Thumbs up
3
Dining at IKEA is convenient. The food is good but nothing really to rave about. Prices are kept reasonable and I think given the unique experience of eating in a retail outlet this place remains popular with Singaporeans.
1
self-service is expected of ikea cafeteria so that's not an issue. but it was very crowded and the food tastes very very processed. value is good though.
4
It always nice to eat out at places like this. Getting in to the crowd n buying and eating it while it is hot. Great meat ball, pastry and unlimited coffee! Will be going again.
3
Good value for money, very efficient way to avoid starvation while shopping. Recommend the salads and of course the meatballs!
4
We've been here 2 times. Our favorite food is the swedish meat ball. It's really good. Great place for a family meal
4
There is nothing to complain about the IKEA resto: FACILITIES: very good. Spacious ambient, wheelchair accessible, area for kids, etc etc...SERVICE: well, the service here it's you! You get your tray, choose what you want to eat, get what you want to, go & pay. Then, like in a hawker center, it's nice if you bring back your tray at the designated area.FOOD: when you come here you can be sure the food is going to be safe and tasty. There is also an area only for Halal customer. Also kids menus are available.To sum up: go there and enjoy the food, IF IT'S NOT a week-end. During Saturday and Sunday it seems that a lot of barbarian are accessing the premises. Making the whole experience I have described to you, completely turned upside down. I promise you...I have been there
4
very reasonably priced food. self-service style. go along the stations and pick up what you want and pay, find a seat, enjoy. wont go wrong with the meatballs and chicken wings. the cakes are quite good as well. there's a strictly halal corner. refillable coffee is a big disappointment though we should not expect much. big spacious dining area. remember to clear your own trays/trolleys
3
IKEA is a little like coming home everywhere all over the globe!In the restaurant you find also some of the well-known products!My husband chose the salmon lasagna, tasty but dried, I took the steamed salmon, very tasty.The typical Swedish cake and cheescake were delectableBut the beverages from the self-service machine was terrible.First choice : sparkling water, the taste of bleach and gas is terrible, so switched to Diet Coke (Pepsi) same problem, obviously they take plain water from the tap and it taste for bleach! So people from ikea, change it please, for the rest thumbs u
5
Me and my wife love spending the day at ikea!The ambience is like livinf in a huge masion in which everything you see there you can buy.The food is tasty yet affordable.They have all kinds of activity for kids.Ikea is number one for us!
5
Every month we visit Ikea just to eat our favorite Meatballs and chicken wings, my daughter really love their food. Though sometimes a bit crowded and no seats available, we can back anytime as their shops is only nearby the cafeteria. They are selling cheap food and unlimited drinks for only $1.
3
furniture and ideas are okay and best suited for small apartment spaces and for people who do not want to fix any permanent furniture
3
Been here a few times, and finding a seat is always very tough. Food here is acceptable. We always like to order mushroom soup as got many mushroom slices in the soup.
3
Food is good except that on my day of visits, only 2 persons were serving and que was long. However, the food is good and there's special rate for member. Worth the wait.
1
Crowded, noisy, rude, bad table manners, dirty, inconsideration. Having been a student in Sweden and visited Ikea, the local joint is a disgrace and let down. The taste of meatballs and soup is far off the mark. Training videos instructing local visitors on better dining environment prior to entry should be a requisite. Don't come here on weekends. Many are window-shoppers and families gather to eat and eat in another of their routine outing. This is not a place to visit for international visitors. A failure at promoting the best.of Swedish culture and cuisine. If one has been to Ikea Stockholm you will understand what I am decrying. Pass instead of Heij
2
This restaurant is always noticeably busy. Today was no exception at 2.30 on a weekday afternoon.Apparent value for money brings Singaporeans out in numbers. The restaurant however, whilst serving tasty food fails to understand that if you have to stand in line for more than 15 minutes between the food being served and paid for then your delicious meal will be cold, miserable and less appealing.Such was my experience today.Cheap but not for the discerning eater
4
Food is definitely good. Taste-wise and price-wise. Pretty good variety. Nice to know it has been keeping its tradition of providing good food together with good furniture. Problem is the long queue of guests even at non-peak hours. Sometimes, it will take you 15-20 minutes just to get your food. And another long queue to find available tables for dining. Maybe expansion is needed. Nevertheless, still gave them a high rating.
4
We went on a Sunday. It was really crowded but for someone like me that comes from a country without Ikea, we were willing to endure the long queue just to eat their famed meatballs. Verdict: Swedish meatballs was so-so. It was not worth the queueing up. However, the fish and chips that we ordered was really good and worth the queueing up (this is coming from a non-fish eater like me). Don't order dessert as it is not worth it. Get a cup of coffee (it was surprisingly good). I hear the chicken is great and saw many people ahead of me in the queue get them
4
After shopping at IKEA, decided to have lunch there. It's always crowded. Order the Poached Salmon with Potatoes and Chicken Wings. Poached salmon was fresh and tasty. Fried chicken wings were the all time favourite, crispy on the outside, tender on the inside. Really valued for money.Enjoyed this simple lunch at the self served cafeteria. Must visit when in IKEA
3
Went to Ikea in Tampines this week for shopping and a bite to eat.Can't say I'm impressed compared to my last visit years ago.Firstly, the pricing posted for Chicken Chops + Broccoli was $3 on the outside signage but $4 at the serving counter. Not that it mattered, as they had run out of chops anyway - there goes my preferred choice ;-(Choice was further limited as this is the month of Ramadan and the Malay section was closed - just my timing....Secondly, the cinnamon buns that went with coffee took some searching as they were erroneously labelled as butter croissants. Hmm, can't tell the difference, is it?Thirdly, the coffee...aah, the coffee! Possibly the less said the better. Whatever happened to the lattes and cappuccinos? Sure, pricing has dropped to a mere 50 cents - so I guess we get what we pay for but hey, I'm prepared to pay more for a decent latte to go with my meal. At least, we could settle for a kopi-O that tastes like kopi-O?Lastly, someone forgot to remind the serving lady that service comes with a smile, not an inscrutable look, unless you're auditioning for one of those TV series?The cafe has a captive market of Ikea shoppers.Question is : will I be back
3
It has been a while since I last visited the Ikea CafÃ©. Despite hearing some not so positive feedbacks about it recently, I decided to go along when my colleague suggested going there for lunch. Beside, I do missed their meatballs and chicken wings.To my disappointment, the meatballs and chicken wings are not as great as they used to be. Just average and not something that I will crave for after eating. Even the coffee standard has dropped. Used to be freshly brewed by cup, now is pre-brewed. Hope Ikea will brings back the old high standard and be great again
5
First time at an IKEA cafe, the food was delicious, fresh and cheap! The salmon and hollandaise was really flavoursome as were the meatballs. The marzipan dessert looked really cute and was delicious!
4
Great place to just hang of you're simply looking waste a lot of time queuing but provides satisfaction to your tummy. Having small children along is tricky but they seem to love the place
3
You can find so many things in ikea, even the cafeteria has a good selection of Asian and western food. During Chinese New Year, you can even come here to Loh hei, the chicken wings is very Crispy and tasty.
5
Nice if you can find a table.....it's usually very crowded. Prices are reasonable which possibly explains why it's perpetually busy. Drinks are bottomless (free refills!) which makes them great value!
4
I'm glad that Ikea provides Halal-certified food in their cafeteria. The food menu changes daily and are quite affordable too. Soft drinks are free-flow at only a dollar. 👍
4
The queue is always long but fast. Even the restaurant is big it's hard to find a seat. Chicken wings is my fave food here.
2
While they have done their best to make the process as fast as possible, the place has way too many people and getting and paying for food takes a lot of time. The food itself is bland and not that tasty. Ironically, all dishes look great! We always end up getting so much due to this and never end up liking anything. Had to add tomato sauce on everything to get some taste.Nordic lemon water was good though.Better to eat elsewhere
3
As always, avoid the dinner/lunch hour, do go early like 11.30am or 5.00pm. Then you will enjoy the meal more and feel less frustrated.I ordered the Fried rice with the 2 chicken wings. Fried Rice is not warm, not much ingredients put into it, but goes with the wings - it's very nice ! Alternatively, you can choose the Nasi Padang set - by luck, you have nice dory fish with black sauce, veggie to go with and a meat choice.But be an early bird and you get more choices, go late and NOTHING is left to be ordered! Only disappointment awaits you. The halal section, especially.Would have preferred abit more added to the Fried Rice (for me, spring onions!), though and rice to be served warm. Price is $4.50,Halal section. Drinks is $1.00 and refillable. Ordered 2 pcs popiah (chinese wrap with veggie) to go with it and that is $1.20 for 2.For the non-halal you have more varieties, but the queue is longer.Locals, foreigners like Pinoy, Indians, Koreans, Chinese (China), Europeans are all over the place. A Multi national dining place ! Regardless of race/country, language or religion - all dining under one roof ! the Singapore spirit !Catch the free Shuttle bus from Tampines MRT / Pasir Ris MRT (weekends only)/ Bedok MRT/Sengkang to take you there
4
We have visited Ikea many a times but always avoided going to the restaurant because of the crowd and many a times unable to find a seat. Last week we tried ..meatball in a sauce, lasagne, lotus leaf rice, almond cake and garlic bread with drinks.Meatball was quite tender and my kids loved it.Lasagne was good too and very filling specially with my appetite it was quite big for me along to finish it.Lotus leaf rice size was big too that's what my hubby had mentioned. Garlic bread tastes nice with a twist of wholegrain bread.Almond cake was super moist and rich totally worth it
4
We loved to eat here every time we visit IKEA store. the Salmon is very fresh, even my kids like it. Swedish meatball is very yummy. The best thing in this cafe is they provide good children area for kids to play. Parents can enjoy the food while watching them playin
5
Best place for Chicken Wings and the Meatball !!! Yum !!! Even though the cafe its always crowded but the cashiers and staffs and pretty fast in movements. Only thing is you got to wait for a table for a long time :)
3
Dinner at weekend~packed with customers.need to queue for at least 20 mins. Beef meat balls n chicken wings are top favourite.coffee n tea is free of you are the members.come on weekday is better less crowd
4
Understandably famous for their Swedish Meatballs. Got to have them every time we dine here. And we love their fried chicken wings and their poached salmon.
4
Good for family short trip and getaway for couple of hours. You can light lunch and dinner with lots of Swedish food stuff. Looking at furnitures and decors gives you inspirations to work harder and renovate your home.
3
Both restaurant is getting pricy now.Salmon used to be affordable but not now .The way the staff served or scoop the food especially the halal restaurant just like army style instead of scooping the food nicely presented on the plate ,they just threw everything ,no passion or heartless despite paying for it and not begging for food.Through observation ,Singaporean working in service industry in most of the cafe,restaurant ,fast food chain hardly smile .For whatever reason they are not happy with their job despite paying a lot of money just to eat in Singapore .Even when we give our pets food to eat ,we put the food on the pets plate nicely instead of throwing it 
5
good food, very reasonable prices .....if you have to feed a family of 4 on a trip you appreciate ikea's food prices very much. we have been to many ikea's around the world. perth, wa,, brisbane, singapore, hongkong and germany. potions are big and prices are small. and as a ikea-family member cafe in germany is free. many of the stores are along the autobahn. on a trip you can have your breakfast there, your lunch and dinner. always at a different store. and there is always something nice to buy
4
Was at Ikea Alexandra checking out some furniture. Was a little hungry and needed a quick bite. Went to the counter at the ground floor, just outside the checkout counters to get a hot dog. It costs $1.You then walk to the side where thereâ€™s a counter with huge dispensers for tomato ketchup, chilli sauce and mustard. I added the ketchup and mustard to the hotdog. Its good
5
You can't go past the $2 Hot Dog Deal! Dog, drink & cone, the kids love it, while we get to use it as a bribe to shop. Win-Win.They have a few food options including Curry Puffs (also tasty!), they have something for everyone really
3
The line can be very long so a fast track to get your food is to queue at the Halal counter which has fewer choices on the menu but the popular meatballs, chicken wings are available. The Nasi Goreng and Nasi Padang are not bad comparing to most food courts
1
This is not the first time these local Chinese aunties who served food are terribly rude & appalling but several times over the months since 2013. In contrast, the Malay cashiers are so polite & pleasant esp Cik Siti. Every time coming to Ikea was a happy event for me to bring my family there & everytime these local Chinese aunties never fail to be crude & blatantly rude to courteous diners who queued up patiently & had to swallow such nonsensical treatment. I observe the servers at the Muslim Corner dont behave like these arogant local Chinese aunties. The Filipino staff were polite & helpful. I reckon management has to seriously look into these matter because it spoils our happy day patronising Ikea. Besides having good products, service is equally vital in any businesses. Dont give lame excuses that these local Chinese aunties cant communicate English properly because if their attitude serving customers is abyssal, even their gestures & facial expressions & tone of voice could reflect their rottenness. Learn from the Japanese people, despite zero command of English, we had no complaints whatsoever with their service because they serve with a highly motivated positive attitude. It's the right attitude that matters most, the rest will fall in place.
4
This is my favourite meeting place for informal meet up with friends and contacts. The cafe opens at 9:30am and serves very reasonable breakfast. The coffee and tea are cheap by Singaporean standard.
3
Super long queues on weekends, not to mention finding a table was like treasure hunting. Food was okay, prices are affordable.
4
Anyway you do it this cafeteria packs a punch. Chicken wings, meatballs and salad and free refills for drinks! Load up before shopping and eat again after shopping!
Dining area is clean and odor free.
4
Great place for a family meal. However it gets over crowded on weekends. The management is not there to stop overcrowding you buy your meals after queuing up and walk around for a seat. If you cannot find one then you look out for someone whom is finishing their meal and hope they would leave soon after their meal. 
2
I really think Ikea needs to take a long hard look at itself here and set aside tables for CUSTOMERS of the Ikea store. i understand they are running a business but the cafe is full every time I have come shopping with staff from local businesses. Treat your customers properly or we will shop elsewhere
3
I dare say Ikea's chicken wings are the best on this Island.Everything else is decently above average, but nothing mind-blowing. A good place for a family meal, but definitely not the right place for dates/dinner outing with friends. It's always crowded/noisy and difficult to sit if your group gets too large
3
Had their meatball at the restaurant! Best meatball I had even if I compare it against Sweden.The chicken wings was superb great! But it is always long queue there. I like the self service of throwing your own used tray after your meals.The salmon set was great too! Fresh and tasty! Price was reasonable too. I think is SGD7.90. Worth to try when u are near there. Tampines and Alexander outlet
4
I think food in Ikea is very value for money. They have kids meal as well and their pricing is consider cheap as they are aircond room, clean, and neat unlike hawker centres. It is a self service cafe where you have to clear up your table after enjoying your meal and have to Q to order and take the food you ordered by yourself to a table. It is very crowded during dinner time and you have to wait for a table or seat. Their drinks are refillable 
5
Great place if you are shopping in Ikea. It's a bit chaotic now due to the year end school holidays. Quite difficult to get a table, do go early. Food is delicious, fresh & good. Their signature fried chicken is juicy, tender & very tasty. Every table will sure to have this dish. Next is their Salmon, tasty, yummy & no fishy smell. Like the way they served the potatoes with Brocoli, good way to have kids who don't eat their veggie. The potato is flavorful. Yum Yum. Occasionally, IKEA will run promotion for members. It's a good deal to get stuffs during promo. IKEA members are also entitle to free coffee & Tea & free refills too. No messy table as patrons are requested to clear thier tables for the next diners
4
Its a great option if you are doing shopping in Ikea itselfAmbience - can get a bit chaotic and difficult to get a table during peak hours but its expected and the generally a pleasant experience - remember to return your trays after mealFood - generally very fresh and good quality. read the food signage with price while queuing so that you know what you want when its your turn to order. Fried chicken and meatball are winners as well as safe choices. Occasionaly they run promo like free hot drinks for Ikea Member card. Dessert should not be ignored as they are surprisingly very good especially Butterscotch cake(I ended up buying a box in the kiosk downstair)Price - very affordable - I guess that's the reason they are packed Tips : very much a self serve restaurant - so be considerate, dont mess your table too much else its you who clean it for the next dine
5
Everything we go here we for some shopping we see to eat that we get to try their Swedish meatballs. It's so nice that I can't get enough of it. I also like their chicken wings
5
Having a great time shopping and go off for a lovely eat out day is awesome. Lovig thisnplace for their meatballs and chicken wings
4
Ejo wouldnt love to go shopping then go devouring after such? I love their meatballs. Super! Well i love their chicken wimgs too
5
My personal. Favorite here is the swedish meatballs and the chicken wings. I wouldnt mind eating these all the time o visit ikea
4
It is one of our family most favorite restaurants in Singapore. Our family members love to ride a bus or MRT there just to take a lunch instead buying the products. The spaghetti and chicken wings are awesome. But like others said, it is too crowded and the place is getting older. They need to fix it up bigger, cleaner and more homie
3
When we talk about IKEA, of course it is well known for its ready-to-assemble furniture (such as beds, chairs and desks), appliances and home accessories. But do you know it also has cafe inside that serves Swedish dishes and I really like the meatballs, I think it's the greatest Swedish Meatballs I've ever eaten. Swedish Meatballs is a plate of meatballs served with mashed potato (and its sauce) and strawberry jam. I really like the taste when you combine everything there. The taste is savory with a little sweet and sour from the jam, I find it strange but it's delicious. The other foods here are also great enough, like chicken wings and butterscotch cakes. That's for the foods, other than that, it's too crowded and it's a kind of self service restaurant, that makes the service even worse. If you want to come here, I suggest you to avoid lunch, dinner, weekend, and public holiday because it's definitely not comfort at all. But for everybody who wants to try Swedish dishes, you should come here and order that meatballs (highly recommended)
4
The foods are very good and the value are affordable cost of a course meal are less than $10. Avoid during lunch and dinner time, public holidays and weekends because alot of people eating and long queue. Best to come off period. Recommend to eat their fish and chi

I went there for dinner at the weekend. In Tampines. Very easy access. Exit the right door from the tampines mrt station, went right and wait at the bus station for free shuttle to ikea. The bus is so crowded, the door is barely closing. The queue is very long. Thank god, i eat in the halal section so the wait is not that long. I love the swedish meatball, i ate like 15 hahaha. So good. The cake is also good. But we almost can't seat anywhere. I hate it. We need to fight with a child, because he doesn't allow us to seat. Eventhough we got the seat from other people, who had finished their meal. We decided to not eat there for too long and take out our left over. We eat the not so good fried rice and fried chicken wings for breakfast in the airport the next day. Oh yeah the cashier aunty is not very friendly. She yells at people. But i just love the swedish meatball, it's a must when i visit Singapore. That's why i will come back hehehe

 Visited IKEA Cafe for dinner on a Saturday evening and had a list of unhappy experiences below,1. No table. Waited for one for over 20 mins by standing next to a family that appeared to be finish but hogged much longer than they appeared2. Queue for the food took us another 15 mins.3. Food server was not helpful, throwing packed chicken on the food display to with a big thud over all patron faces dis contentedly.4. Waited another 15 mins for the ribs to be grilled. I guess that's why the queue was so long. 5. No glass cups available for soft drinks. Disappointingly, NO more free soft drinks for members although coffee was free and, sadly, we don't drink coffee so we just bought a glass which we had to wait a long while to get6. No cutlery. How in the world do we eat ribs and meatballs without any cutlery and had to wait again..with other unhappy patrons for these. After a long wait, I asked the cashier but get a brush off by her saying that she's only doing the cashiering and cannot help. So, I ventured around for some IKEA personnel but none besides the cashiers and ..the cleaners? So I ended up eating my food by hand while my family waited for some good IKEA person to help. Finally...we have plastic cutlery but no knife to cut the ribs.. So we waited again but no knife came so we ate our ribs by hand.7. The chicken wings were terribly dry8 The soft drinks (only coke is left) were not chilled and not sufficiently carbonated and no ice is available.9. After finishing our dinner and forgiving the bad experience, I checked my bill receipt and noticed that I was over charged with a additional dish of $9.50 which I didn't order for. I pursued to the cashier and fortunately found a staff who helped returned the money.Our family loved to dine at IKEA but over time, service and food had been severely compromised and I hope the management there can bring it back to the good old times of making customers feel good again with their dining experience there.Thank yo

4
For who first time come to IKEA tampines, go to upper floor at the store than, go to cafetaria at buy kottbullar, gravlaks, at special promotion food.
4
Dining at the ikea restaurant is always the most pleasant of experiences. Always the best value for delicious food and good portions in Singapore.
2
seriously don't understand why people are flocking to IKEA....food is so-so and its not really cheap..dam crowded...I won't go there for a meal unless im shopping at ikea
4
Visit the Ikea cafeteria and you will see Singaporeans at their best scarfing down really cheap and not bad meatballs, chicken wings, and the like. Go on a Sunday morning for a real culinary and social experience.

The queue is there as usual in Singapore but the food is really yummy, wow. A good food and things to buy at same place, simply great.

First time tried IKEA restaurant and I've always been curious about the köttbullar (Swedish meatballs). Aaand I think it's not that good, the taste is just so-so and still edible. I also ordered the pancake and croissant which were totally average in taste. Kinda regretting the decision of ordering 20 pieces of the köttbullar, it was just too much and only mediocre taste. Went there for lunch and there were too many people, literally. Finding tables were just as hard as the days back in high school. Won't go back there so soon

Ikea is an interesting concept store which is HUGE. You are bound to get tired if roaming around the place, which is nothing short of a delight for shoppers. And that is where this cafeteria proves to be highly useful - to relax, have a drink, grab a bit and continue exploring IKEA. The prices are not cheap for cafeteria food and varieties are limited. So there's no reason to come up here specially unless you really require a break from that shopping! And yes, I agree with the previous reviews. The staff is a bit grumpy!
1
The was never meant to be a high end restaurant but now it isn't even decent anymore. The meatballs were COLD in the center (as opposed to being cold outside and still warm in the centre which would have implied being left out for too long which is still better than a cold centre which leads to the conclusion that it was never cooked (reheated) properly in the 1st place!)The fried Chicken Wings have also gone downhill and were not crispy. At the same time, the coffee machine is no longer of the beans to expresso variety but rather just of the powder to drip type so this has gone downhill too.To add insult to injury, the prices have gone up slightly and the staff are now grumpier than ever. I'm not eating here again
4
For singapore standards, the food here is good value. Meatballs and the chicken wings are the most commonly ordered food here. Nothing great, nothing fancy. They do have some promo items, like the last time I was there, it was the salmon. Drinks are bottomless. Love their catsup, hotsauce station and those giant hanging dispensers
4
it's self service. You pick the food and pay at the cashier. I order tuna sandwich & a cup of latte (cost SGD 2,5). The cashier will give coin for the drink machine. I love the sandwich and so do the latte. The ambience is also nice & cozy. Don't forget to clean the table after eat and return the tray to the station :
4
If you haven't been to an Ikea before, this one is worth a visit. Lots of interesting ideas....... and the meatballs are classic........
5
place is pretty overloaded with people during lunch hours, but still food which is being served is good and price is reasonable, worth of eating there
4
Great place for one stop for all. Can drop the kids at the play area while you eat or shop. Food is good value for money. Suggest you try
3
Ok cheap food and it's cheap for a reason, there's nothing special about it. Yet there always seems to be a huge line here. It's nice enough but I wouldn't go out of my way to recommend someone to go to Ikea for food,
5
Okay other than those furnitures that you always plan to buy there, the cafeteria is famous for it's meat balls. their meat balls are juicy and tender and you wouldn't want to give it a miss!
5
Meatballs & Chicken Wings + all those swedish desserts - to die for! Ooh.. those hotdogs they sell... tasty! Must visit if you are in that area (hey, even if you are not in that area, visit them!)
4
Children loves the meatballs and the chicken wings. Value for Money for a quick snack. But it is very crowded during lunch at Alexandra outlets as well as weekends for both outlets. A very family oriented and friendly place even if you have small toddlers and babies.
4
I love to go ikea, its spacious. The kids love the hot dogs and the coke for $1.50. A must try is a plate of 8 chicken wings...yummy!Things to note-1- Go early if you are bringing your kids to the play area, it opens at 10am, you can leave your kids there while you shop and eat.2- Bring along a recycling bag for your shopping (IMPT
2
I'm not sure why but the quality of the food (including the drinks) has gone down. There is a very small selection of drinks. The meatballs are not as tasty as before and lets not begin to talk about the unsmiling staff. The child friendly aspects has gone as well. There are no longer utensils and bibs readily available
3
should come here maybe at least a pair so you could split up one ordering the food and the others looking for a table (this is a special case if you came here during weekends or holiday and during eating time)first you grab the the trolley for carrying your tray, get in line there are appetizer, drinks, dessert then main menu. after taking your order bring it to the cashier. the food is nice, i ordered the meatball, salmon and lamb, cheese cake as a dessert. it is an unlimited hot and cold water thoug
4
For those Budget family can buy a nice design furniture and household related item at the stalls. Suitable for family with kids to shop at Ikea with foods and kids care service.
4
A nice place to eat simple food especially for kids. The desserts are good too. Nice service staffs. A good place to hang out too.
4
can found small and useful equipment and tools to decorate my house. Kitchener, bedroom, SOHO living room design are frantastic, and I like the meat balls.
3
1)The overall managment of the cafe is good, but the crowd gets too big to handle, especially over weekend and public holidays2)Food quality acceptable. Reckon the "Meat Balls" over-rated3)Managment should look into ways of improving seatiing, services etc for clients over the weekend and public holiday
4
cheap, clean, kids love the meatballs (if they get back on the menu), can be very crowded so best to act as the Singaporeans do and "chop" your table before you queue for food, or better still split up so some get the food as the others get the tabl
4
We went here for our first stop as soon as we land at Changi Airport..Getting here is quite easy. Although most taxi driver wont take you to a short distance desitination if you're taking a cab from Changi Airport.Just take a bus or MRT, from Tampines MRT station there is a free shuttle bus that goes to the area and drop off right in front of IKEA. But on some cases, you will wait quite a time for the shuttle bus to arrive (approx 30 minutes on weekends). Or if you cannot wait, just take the public bus from the bus stop right in front of Tampines MRT, and a few stops later alight right beside IKEA Tampines (you will need to cross the road first via the crossing bridge)There is a free Locker for visitors to use at 3rd floor near the toilets, but my huge backpack wont fit there.The cafetaria is huge, lots of tables and still it will get filled up very fast.the foods are great.Also there is a Halal certified line (only in IKEA Tampines) loved the meatballs and the chicken wing
4
They have great meatballs, salmon, mushroom pancake, cheesecake. For folks like us, who have returned to India from US, it was a great way to have these hard to find things at a decent price. The coffee and croissant are to die for! The store offcourse has great stuff for the house, picked up few for the kitchen
3
There are 2 Ikea Singapore! One in Tapinees and one in Queenway. I went to Ikea (Queen way) average 3 times per years and visited the cafeteria. I like the chicken wings and it suit my taste! A lot of customers like "meat ball". Normally, people came here to buy funiture and etc. :-} Su
4
If you're still afraid of the recent meatball scandal, be not afraid, they have lovely fried chicken wings too. Be sure to come in a group so that someone can order food, and the rest hog a table. Desserts are somewhat disappointing if you're used to the good stuff
4
The Swedish meat balls are great at the Cafeteria, it's one of the best places to dine when it comes to home furnishing outlets. the only drawback is that, it is heavily crowded over the weekends, and at times the tables are not so clean.Reasonably priced and a place which kids and adults all would love, there are other tasty dishes, grilled fish and the chicken wings are also good
5
I'd only go there for their food. I always dream to live inside IKEA for a night!! The display is wonderful and too many products to seduce you to buy even you don't need them.
5
I really love IKEA. Just wish Johor Bharu have it. We came from Johor Bharu to Ikea singapore to buy some things. The things here is superb nice and cheap. Great idea to decorate your home. I love IKEA concept idea.
3
If you need basic stuff and do not want to pay too much, then Ikea is the place. But remember that you need to install it yourself, which typically takes me an hour or two
4
I've always enjoyed going to Ikea... be it to look for house stuff, getting new ideas or having a great meal @ the cafeteria - Meat Balls!
Prefer the tampines outlet cause parking is free ! ;)
3
Same as most Ikea's globally - good products, but very busy. Don't go mid-day during the weekend, crazy busy! Difficult to get a taxi afterwards - long queues.
4
The meatballs, for one, is what most people go for. The prices in Ikea Cafeteria is reasonable. I avoid going there mostly due to the crowds - unable to find a seating place almost all the time. If you pop in during weekdays mornings, the crowd is not so bad. It's a good place to take a quick bite & drink after browsing through Ikea itself
4
This is one of the best cafetaria in home furnishing center i've ever been. The assortment was quite complete and presented with swedish taste.My personal liking is the almond cake, the meatball, chicken wing. The beverage i prefer to take soda since its refillable.During the weekend this place is so packed up and hard to find an empty seats, mostly because not all the patron after finish their meals didn't bother to bring their tray to the sorting places, and the cleaning staff is not much.The rest room near this cafetaria is also not that clean (compare to any in most of singapore).But the food is GREAATTT... the kids, young ones, parents all will love it..
4
It's not just a one stop shop for all your household needs, their cafe serves great and delicious food, ranging from Swedish to local dishes. In the As-Is section, we managed to pick up something with a little defect at a fraction of the original price. Cool
1
Have bought quite a number of different furniture from IKEA and I'm sorry to say that I've been disappointed at every turn. Good looking stuff but don't last. If you don't mind your stuff breaking within a year of purchase it's a good place to get good looking furniture
4
love visiting ikea any time..not only does the feet does the excersice of walking ..so does the mind with lots of variety and ideas. sometimes i just visit to get a good feel of their ideas and implement them in the home with their diy and good variety of items. always been an Ikea Fa
4
Every room in the hous ecan be furnished in Ikea store everything you can think of is available to buy,design your own rooms decore easily and modern.
3
IKEA Singapore is well organized as all IKEAs in the world, but selection is limited and lacks creative designs found elsewhere. Most things are too plain and cheap.
3
Singaporean infatuation with Scandinavian carpentry opened the second showroom complex in the east. But who doesn't love IKEA. Like MacDonald's IKEA is consumer overkill.
3
This is the place where you can buy ready made funitures. The range is fantastic and very reasonably price
4
It is a great place to get things for your home! Pricing is affordable with the quality given. I will get the other stars up if they often update their design.
4
Don't like the checkout lanes that are always too busy and yet there are unmanned lanes they should open but one has to like Ikea's selection and price; great value for what you get. Plants are nice too.
5
Easy to shop, great range of choices and colours, sand styles. And the best part of it.... is the price!! Really really good everywhere i go! But a little advice... get someone to assembly the stuff for you... is not as simple as it looks! And they do it in 20 minutes each!
4
The Chinese New Year is approaching and Ikea is the place for us to shop for household stuff. We love how it is organised by sections. However, at times when we are rushing, we find it difficult to get to the place or section we want. Over the years we had bought many furniture from Ikea. Service is good. Items are inexpensive and long lasting.The only issue we have is the long queue to pay.We hope they can come up with a system where the customer scan the item and they just pay the full amount at the cashier. This may saves time.Customer can cancel item if they decide not to buy.At the end, the items that have been scanned can leave the premise.I know they need to help earth by not giving plastic bags. However, as the store carry big items, sometimes it is difficult not to have a plastic bag.Also shopping at Ikea may be a last minute decision so the cutsomer may not bring their own carrier or there may be a need to bring a big carrier bag....hope the management will look into this
4
This is the McDonald of furniture, not great quality but reliable. For some we would recommend to check how many pieces are in the box, before you venture of to build it yourself: bought a bed with a couple hundred screws, it took two guys from IKEA about 3 hours to build it with their professional equipment at my home. If I would have done it myself I would have spent the whole weekend (not to count the blisters on my hands). Having them assemble was in this case very well spent money
4
Since the Tampines Ikea was built, I don't remember going any other places for furnishing idea. They got almost everything yuo need and no frill. Reasobale price and guaranteed or free exchange or return policy. I am impressed with the tiny fixing details (ie, screws, nuts etc) that they offer at no charge. See fro yuorselves! Cheers
5
it a place u can get and buy home products at a reasonable rate. it is design in a maze such that you will spent more time inside looking and browsing through the things and even buying the items!
4
Love to bring family here to look at the showroom and deco.
the icecream is so cheap at 0.50 and chicken wings are very delicious.
Hot dog bun is very affordable at $1.
3
Prefer the outlet at Alexandra Road, I find the outlet at Tampines a bit too big and tiresome after a while. It gets too crowded during weekends and wished they have halal version of the meatballs and chicken wings.
4
there is a kiddy playground within this place, so pick the off-peak periods which is away from lunch hours (11:30am to 1:30pm) and dinner hours (6:00pm to 8pm)take a stroll to enjoy the store-shop experience and feel the simple "designer" concepts within the storeStore changes the items with the season, so it is a good place to get a refreshing look on the home all year roun
4
IKEA is next to both Courts and Giant so you can have a fun packed afternoon finished with a weekly shop if that's what lights your candle on your day off. Ikea forces you to start at one end of their shop (4th floor I think) then cattle herds you round everything. Good thing is you see everything, even the things you don't want to see. Bad thing is it's difficult to go straight to a particular type of goods. We have a more local IKEA now at Queensway so haven't used the Tampines for a while. All depends on where you reside.
3
IKEA has à great Swedish food court concepts, they serve what the Swedes like best, salmon, meatballs and many other goodies you can also by in their own food store.IKEA are so good at marketing and to sit down and eat à great meal for à great price, never leave IKEA hungr
4
Being a man and therefore out of my depth with the entire shopping experience, it was a pleasant surprise to find that there was a reasonable restaurant in the building that was quick and cheap. I cant imagine how many meals get served there but it must be thousands
4
If you yearn for a home decor shopping spree, then you must not miss IKEA Tampines! It has much more variety of items as compared to IKEA Alexandra. Best part is that if you cannot get enough shopping from IKEA, Courts Megastore is just around the corner
2
Several reviewers here seem to be combining their views of IKEA (the store) with the restaurant co-located with the store. As this is a restaurant review section - this review is only of the restaurant.Had a bite here with a mate while discussing our shopping plans in the IKEA store. For this purpose, the restaurant is convenient if the queue isn't too long, or the seating too crowded (which was the case early one weekday morning when we visited).You have to be a bit careful to find sort-of acceptable value. Quality, by Singaporean standards, is so-so. Salt levels, for example, are much too high on several items. (As has been said before, you can always add salt at the table - but it's difficult to remove once the cook has added too much..)I have seen IKEA restaurants in other locations described as "fuel, not food". That could sum up this outlet, as well.For slightly less convenience, but better taste and value (if you're observant about where to order) the food court at Giant across the street can be rather better and easy to get to from IKEA. Certainly, there is more choice at lower prices across the street at Giant
4
Ikea at Tampines as we know it is an extremely large store. The restaurant is fairly large too, but probably not large enough to handle the number of people coming to eat. And with the number of people moving in an out, it just looks like a huge mess, including people just going in to use the toilets at the rear of the restaurant. The atmosphere can feel a little more like a war-zone or a bargain flea market kinda place. There are 3 lines total, 2 non-halal and 1 halal line. Food is as per how Ikea Restaurant's food has always been, with their signature meatballs.Kids get to enjoy small play areas inside the restaurant itself.Probably a plus point would be their free-flow soft drinks, at just a dollar per cup. It's quite a bargain. Plus there's ovens to heat your food up if you like them hotter.Overall: Great restaurant with great food at a decent pricing. Might be a little overwhelming when it comes to seating and dealing with the noise level though
4
Clean, nice affordable food, cafeteria line, clean up yourself. Not sure whether I feel like I'm back in school or experiencing a very lax prison eating area. Whatever it is, I'm definitely eating at an IKEA restaurant again!
5
Ikea can be daunting and overwhelming. Always too many people, it's like a feeding frenzy. But bargains aplenty at Ikea and with the cafeteria on the 2nd floor, those deals extend to food. Pancake breakfast for $3? Where else can you find that in Singapore?
4
Its ability to reinvent itself from time to time keeps visiting refreshing. There is always someone at hand to assist, inform and offer choices and ideas.
3
Ok if you are looking for cheap modern furniture....otherwise avoid. Unless you are after Swiss foods (the smoked salmon is good value) in the little Swiss shop
4
You can buy many things under one roof - ikea meatballs, ikea chicken wings, kitchenware, bathroom stuff, living room items, photoframes, softtoys, chairs, tables, too many to mention. A huge place and great for families with small children. Lots of furniture ideas for inspiration, lots of DIY stuff to explore. IKEA itself is a huge area to explore so you won't run out of things to buy. Free parking too!!!!!!!!!!
4
Ikea an iconic blue warehouse building in the eastern part of SG , is a cult fav of citizens n foreigners here. Not only do u get value for food at the always bustling cafeteria, you get to do some shopping for the home. Plus kids get to enjoy playing in various play areas and Smaland. There are lovely baby rooms although these can be smelly at times. ( some parents disposed of diapers unwrapped into the bin!) it's also a good place for mommies who want to take their babies out with baby friendly facilities. Definitely one of the national favorite places to visit during holidays and festive season for nice and affordable decor pieces
4
We've been going to IKEA almost every month. Happy to see IKEA finally doing some make over in their display room. It got so boring because the same design has been there for years. But there were many good ideas and products that were useful for our home. We loved to drop by every now and then to see if there is new product/invention. What's better is that IKEA Tampines offers free parking compare to IKEA Alexandr
3
This is a typical example of an IKEA. It's larger than the other one in Singapore, but pretty typical size by comparison to stores in North America. Like all IKEA stores, it is bright and has high ceilings, and there's the restaurant, child's area, etc. The prices do seem to be less of a bargain compared to the IKEA stores in the US and Canada. Aside from this, there's nothing to warrant any major accolades, but also nothing to warrant any major complaints. Some minor issues are its great distance from town, and the extremely long lines to buy an ice cream cone--which you make yourself once you buy a token at the counter. They should just invest in a token dispenser
4
shopping here is rather enjoyable. there are no pressure to buy or salesmen who talk you into buying stuff you don't need. the layout allows you to look for what you need and there is no time pressure. nobody will rush you to buy or to leave. when you are satisifed and ready to purchase, simply go to the counter to have your orders printed. depending on what you buy, some can be picked up immediately. bulky items can be delivered for a fee.
5
Definitely a one stop shop for everything you need for home or office. You can decorate and equip a bare house in just one visit here! absolutely fabulous selection. Great christmassy feel during my last visit in November. Must visit for people from countries without Ikea. and the Tampines mega store is the better one in Singapore
3
It is the biggest IKEA shop in Singapore. The cafe is better but a little expensive.
You may take free shuttle bus from Tampines MRT to reach the IKEA. If your travel time is tight, you may ignore this site.
4
Good prices on certain items. Very efficient and on a par with their European counterparts. Restaurant is good at reasonable prices.
4
I seem to always find something new in my visits to Ikea. New design concepts and ideas, new loose-end items I can get for home or as gifts.
3
They have lots of variety, but quality is not so good. They dont last long. Overall ok. Children section is nice.
5
Parking is free, very kids friendly. Kids love the chicken wings there.
Nice play area for kids, just avoid weekend, too pack
4
A little out of town and off the public transport routes. You catch an Ikea courtesy bus from Tampines MRT bus stop. If you have shopped merrily you need to catch a cab home as the bus can be packed and there is no space for shopping bags
4
A great place to go if you are looking for durable, inexpensive & unique furniture. Most of the pieces can be self collected, self assembled. The return policy is friendly, fuss free. You are free to roam around. Friendly staff is at hand to assist if you need help.
5
Love to visit this place for the items, choices but only if their cafe had better food choices. For guests coming some picked up the sofa bed, manual is very expressive easy to arrange. Some of the items are really priced low compared to Singapore. IT is a complete store for anyone who wishes to redecorate of furnish their home.Being a member we enjoy free drinks at their cafe but nothing in the cafe which is worth recommending. People try their chicken wings but it is just average. But their store had many more interesting things rather than food
5
I always love IKEA !!! IKEA always have that 'smell' that can make you feel like home once you step inside IKEA. I've went to IKEA Holland & Germany and all I could say was I always love IKEA. Should go there to browse or just to ate the famous Swedish Meatballs. The best !!
5
How about a DIY cabinet? You can find them in IKea either in Tampines or Queensway. They have a built n bed, cabinets, kitchen cabinets, pillows, everything that you will be needding to build a house, they have it. from the simplest rugs to the compliacted wallpapers, they have it. :)
4
Definitely my fave place to do Furniture shopping. The best part would be to end it with some meatballs in my stomach
4
The children play area is a great way to keep children occupied while parent shop. The fried chicken wings at the cafe is the best in Singapore.
3
All in one palce for your home wares, bring your measurements though so make it more productive. (dont want to guess and check right?). Drop by the great canteen for a drink or bite..
4
There is sure something to buy for any part of your house/office. No frills and all diy. Come prepared with measurements, or just have a look around. Do avoid the festive seasons, especially Hari Raya Puasa Chinese New Year and Christmas. Although, there sure to be some sorta irresistable crazy sale in these same periods
4
I found out Ikea @Alexandra Road had changed their membership to a 'Ikea Family' card and members would need the new card to be counted. I have only signed up at the end of 2011 and was surprised that they changed the card within less than a year's time.The main entrance to the Ikea store @Alexandra is now on the second floor - and the first floor is only for cashiers and exit. Although they put up barriers at the first floor to deter customers from entering via the cashiers, people still squeezed through the paying queues as it's easier to access the first floor if one only wants to get stuff from the first floor.
3
Efficient, lots of choice, crowds, a fairly painful check-out and paying experience makes for an Ikea experience very similar to Ikea everywhere. Nice to go when you need some stuff and you will probably find what you want. Delivery and assembly can be arranged, separately, after you have paid and after another queue. Be prepared to wait for the cash registers though ..
2
Everyone knows IKEA. It's a great place to shop for beautifully-designed and inexpensive household stuff. But because of this, the in-house cafeteria becomes too crowded, especially during the weekends and during lunch hours on weekdays. The cafeteria has just become too small to support the number of shoppers who visit IKEA. As a result, the place is packed, messy and there is a lot of stress trying to find a table as it is a self-service cafeteria. The food is really very average although the drinks are cheap. It would ideally be a place for one to stop for a drink before continuing to shop on the lower level. But who needs the stress and the crowds? I avoid the cafeteria like the plaque whenever I go to IKEA. My suggestion is that they have a hostess at the door to manage the cafeteria crowd
2
Not my favourite place to go to for furniture tho it has a good range and decent quality. The meatballs are so in demand that the cafeteria is always so crowded. Why this is so, I dont know cos I dont find it much better than pther western food restaurants
4
we were there for a late lunch, but the place was still pretty crowded. ikea tampines is accessible via a shuttle that goes to tampines mrt station every half hour. you take the same shuttle going back.we tried the gravlax, meatballs, salmon, pasta and pancakes. everything was good, but they ran out of lingonberry juice and didn't refill the dispensers. the set-up was cafeteria style, and it was nice that they encouraged everyone to clean up after themselves.they have a small food section on the floor below where you can get frozen meatballs, gravy mix, jams, beers, cookies and candy
4
I have been going to IKEA since their start many years ago...most fondly remembered from the IKEA European restaurants are the Kotbollar with cream sauce...amazing how from the early beginning IKEA managed to replicate this recipe even in Tampines in 2012! Nice kitchen and service staff, friendly old ladies who clean the table sand are ready for some small talk any time
4
Relatively cheap furniture, great ideas for planning your layouts, decorations and lots of home accessories.
4
I can get everything at one go and get to be the designer of my own home. hehe the Vanilla Ice Cream cone is still as good & also the hot dog bun!
3
i have not been to the place recently so I couldn't give a review but from about 2 years ago it was not a great place to shop
3
IKEA has some great deals but it's nothing special. It also takes forever to get through checkout. Good for necessities though.
3
IKEA here is thesame as you would expect to find in Australia. Handy if you like IKEA goodies, some of their space saving ideas are handy in Singa's
5
A very good display. Everything looks good and hardly anyone walks out without buying something, however small! Worth a visit if your country is without an IKEA. But probably not that many local specifics if you're hoping for that.
4
Window shopping is fine though I am sure you will pick up some cute, affordable, useful stuff along the way
5
We like to go to IKEA for searching small items such as kitchen stuffs, bedrooms, etc. It's reasonable price, though the quality sometimes does not really good. The restaurant is not bad and free drinks for members. I like their salmon fish, when they have promotion for members....it's very cheap! I like to buy some foods at their shop such as hotdog, beverages, chocolates (it's nice and cheap), meatballs, prawns, etc. My daughter like to play in their playground and is their member. It's fun to get their update regurarly
4
IKEA has great Swedish food such as delicious tomato based pasta , or perhaps some freshly cooked salmon with potatoes , as well as other great deserts such as a slice of special cake (a slice of heaven ) , or just some mango jelly , or a cheese cake. There many great varieties of food and oh yeah , I forgot to mention the chicken wings . Boy , the wings there are absolutely fabulous . I addition to food , IKEA sells furniture for your homes . Although not cheap , the items there have good quality and are durable.Are you looking for a bed ?-IKEA has tons of them . Are you looking for a simple chair ?-Yes , IKEA has it all . So why don't you come for a simple but delicious meal and after that , get all the furniture you want . So don't wait , try it out now
4
Kids love the kids club and indoor play area plus their fantastic kids meal.Never miss the meat balls and pan cakes. Must have fried chicken wings.Coffee is also great with good variety of cold drinks too.Tons of home decor ideas and good value furnishing and furnitures especially for kids.Don't know why but I just love their chairs and sofas
4
the food is good, i like the meatballs. eat it with the jam.. remember to ask fr more sauce its never enough..
3
Visited the Ikea Tampines Warehouse, great if you are looking for furnitures or stuffs for the house. The cafetaria is good, food is cheap . Other than that, nothing much really.
4
Must try the fried chicken wing, salmon and meat ball.
5
I often come here whether I will buy something or even no plans at all but to unwind, admire and dream of my future home. They offer endless ideas how to make your home cozy and organized. I love their resto too! The chicken wings and meatballs are the best
3
My family loves IKEA and I have to suffer under the food every now and then. I like the stuff they sell but swedish meat balls just make me queasy.You will see the restaurant full of locals...the weekends and public holidays are not fun, besty visited early in week.
4
Items are not expensive but you need to buy a certain amount of money then you get the free delivery....as a single woman, sometime I don't need so many things but just wish to buy a cupborad but it was so heavy that i couldn't pick it up and no one there to help....and my total amount is lesser than their minimun of above SGD 200 or 250 (If i got it right, as i was there quite sometime back). but overall is a good shopping place
4
Our kids love it. Family friendly nut can be difficult to find a table during peak hours, lunch & dinner time. Kids like the buzz and food choices, pushing the trolley filled with food and sitting at the high tables. Order the fried chicken wings and eat it with your fingers!
4
Ikea is a place to visit if you are looking for furniture that are chic, simple with clean cut designs. If you are looking for furniture white in colour, then this is the place where you could find a number of furniture and designs in white. Besides the furniture, I like the famous Scandinavian meat balls sold at the restaurant inside Ikea
3
I like Ikea and have been to many of them around the world but this is one of the worst. Service people can only do one thing at a time. The prefer to serve one customer who is browsing a catalogue for 10 minutes than answering your simple question in the mean time. Taxi stop is poorly organised causing long queues. No staff to be seen to organize things a bit better
4
Definitely a good place for the kids as well as parents to spend the weekends together. Beside the playground for the kids. Sometimes my kids will choose one of the unit and pretend cooking and washing and watching tv in it. However the service in Alexandar Road Ikea is really disappointing
4
The title says it all - though I hate to look around for tables

cheap stuff. interesting. innovative, a little out of the way though but more or less decent.
4
love to shop in IKEA if im free. you can get lots of nice, unique and cheap furniture or kitchen utility there.

This temple of flattened (impossible to assemble) furniture is utter brilliance. The restaurant vendors original food and is a welcome relief from pot plants and odd lamps. I can't keep away from the place.
4
We go to IKEA at least once a month to make sure that we do a home improvement project. I am amazed to see something new every time i visit. Well organized and a great place to go for DIY and Home improvement projects. The location in Singapore is unbeatable

What I order when I go there? Swedish Meat Balls & the chicken wings always in my list!!! I like the combination of the Swedish meat ball with sauce and jam, although at first i feel it is weird to have meat with jam, surprisingly i like it. But i found that the meat balls size become smaller??Tried their salmon, it is average

Trip to the mall was an ever-relaxing one till recently when more shoppers go there for food or just a walkabout with the family. Kids-a-shouting, parents-a-shouting, shoppers-a-Qcutting, staff-a-shortage, car-a-dashing (in carpark), it's madness.Food quality remains. Price remains. Furniture quality (durability) drops tremendously. Price upping. A piece of furniture I bought 10 years ago from their As-Is department for $30, and I'm still using it today in very very condition. A piece of furniture I bought last year for $298 and already showing defects.The issue of durability could easily be seen in just 1 item - folding chair.1 I bought 10 yrs ago, still good and sturdy. I bought 15 pcs 4 yrs ago for the office, their head-board started to come out after few months of use. Same prices.Better buck up soon..

I love the restaurant there.My companion and I love the baked salmon platter. unfortunately it has been taken off the menu. I wish that the management considers returning the item together with the apple pie which is amazing. the furniture shop is great to browse through even if you are not buying. one can pick up lots of ideas for home decor

IKEA is an institution and if you need a shot of something familiar while in Singapore go here. Regular IKEA style with a twist in the resturant (some local food) at affordable prices, get a table first though since people "mark" a seat about 30 minutes before they actually get their food there :-). I've been here many times
5
I bought most of my furniture and stuff at Ikea. it's not the most reliable stuff but hey, it's cheap and stylish.But the best is the meatball! I don't eat beef anymore now though, but I still enjoy the restaurant and love the chocolate mousse
5
This is the place family & friends meet to get what they need for their home. It has a children play room so that adults can shop. A dining area, Halal food is served at one counter and prayer rooms for muslims.
3
nice n comfort place. quite spacious with nice food. convenient with shuttle bus
5
Is a good place to find what you need, and can give you more ideas... or just browsing around. Good price.
4
a great store when you move into an area - lots of good things cheap. a very good hawker stand across the street.
2
Service and food standards have slipped drastically at the Ikea restaurant, on two occasions I was served cold eggs and cold coffee and on-line complaints were shrugged off in a patronizing manner. Sure, the stuff is cheap but that does not mean it can be of poor quality, certainly not in keeping with Ikea's high standards
5
IKEA has been responsible for most of our soft furnishings and kitchen stuff. Its the first place I think of when I need something for the kitchen, or an affordable piece of furniture. I usually end up at their outlet on Alexandria Road but have trekked to the one in Tampines once to buy a bulkier piece of furniture.
4
The there is really cheap and delicious. The hot dog there is tasty and is just a dollar. It is so much cheaper and delicious as compared to many hot dogs I have tried. It is really worth the try and I can't wait to go back again
4
Like the motto in Singapore, ."Do not have to be rich, to be smart". Went to the show rooms and can have the idea how to decorate the room. Not only the room, the necessary toiletries for business trip. You can also have small bites at the restaurant next door
5
Ikea is the place for all DIY lovers... You can just cash and carry the items back and put them together yourself~ The items there are very affordable, if you visit them never forget to head to the Ikea Cafe as they provide the BEST food (Meatballs, Chicken Wings and many more...
2
If I were a brand manager for Ikea this location would keep me awake at night. The dirty worn out display furniture is distressing but so is the lack of experience or caring from the staff. It's very crowded and not with people buying things, in fact when you go down to the market place it's often fairly empty. Locals come here to hang out! If you want to a see one of the dirty display couches you have to ask the 7 people sitting on it chatting to move
3
Got to be a joke. This is only a place to eat when you are starved but yet need to pick up items at Ikea. No way would I just come here for their food.
4
My wife likes the furniture, my kids like the food. What else could a man want?
4
the food court food good too. Try the beef ball and the salmon.
5
My family visit IKEA every fortnightly. We went there to see their latest products and eat in IKEA restaurant. They have super nice chicken wings and coffee! We will always buy something when we are there!
4
Ikea still provides excellent bargains provided you don't want top-quality furniture, its ambience is excellent.
4
Excellent ! All you need for the home under one roof. Dump the children in the day-care, go grab a quick coffee and shop, shop, shop!
4
Clean lines and great visual merchandising and marketing skills have made Ikea the furniture choice of Singaporeans. The place is constantly packed. Its great to just browse even if you're not buying anything. Though odds are, you will. It's hard to leave Ikea empty-handed without picking up a vase, a pot, a soup ladle, a placemat or a cushion, even a tealight holder!
4
The food court at this IKEA is the largest I have ever seen. People do not pick up after themselves as asked, so it is quite messy because they don't have enough employees to keep up with the cleaning. The pasta sauce on the kids pasta actually had some veggies and was quite good. Cinnamon roll was hard, so make sure you get a fresh one
5
Love the goods here ... cheap, and with good quality... if only I have more baggage allowance, I would have brought home lots of nice and nitty stuffs.There is a resto inside that serves great Chicken wings, and meat balls. MUST MUST Try!!! Fully recommend it
5
IKEA provides value for money furniture, excellent for furnishing your house on a budget. But be warned: the quality varies between products. Some degenerates and needs to be replaced within 1 year. So if you are looking for environmentally-friendly, long-lasting alternative, this is not for you. The food court serves excellent and affordable food. But it is always crowded these days. Be prepared to wait about half an hour and be quick in finding a seat or else! Try the princess cake, Swedish meatballs, potato salad and choc mousse. You can buy frozen version for home cooking too
3
Don't they have something better beside meatballs, fried chicken wings & children's spaghetti? Zzz...
5
Child friendly, good food. Note that this is a self-serve place.
5
+ best , fast, cheapest hotdogs:)
+ good also for cheap lunch meals
- always packed , so patience is required
5
True to its standards, it never fails to impress. Amazing furniture but quality matches the price you pay. You can setup your entire home from just one trip to Ikea.
4
A must have when you go there for meal. I just love the Meat Balls with that strawberry jam and the Chicken Wings are just so must have.
Enough said. I'm having my dinner there later!
3
Simple fare in a clean environment.
It could get noisy during the Sunday breakfasts as families from around the neighbourhood come in droves to have a decent meal.
4
I love the chicken wings there and my hubby love the Swedish meat ball..if we ever make a trip to Shopping there at IKEA..we always stopped by and enjoy our snack :) The price are matching with quality & quantity of foods.
3
Customer service dropped and you can see less people going there nowadays. But still IKEA overall attractive and no other else to check around for some Home furnishing ideas. Example design of the showcase rooms.That is something that they are still quite good & unique at it until some other business takes over them. So far, to Singaporeans, IKEA is the only one to do it big & homely enough
4
I won't be first to state, that restaurant at IKEA is known for it's Swedish meat balls. Although it has little in common with a meat balls in Sweden itself, it's still not bad. I would particularly recommend trying desserts and sweets here. If you are interested in one-dollar ( and refillable!), good coffee, this is the place get it. They have also so-called "Halal" food section, which I haven't try and can't say anything
2
Good:reasonably pricedat IkeaBad:an awful mean in possibly the world's best dining citybland foodextremely crowded, hard to find a place to sitdirty - local's just leave their plates food - which are not quickly cleared awayThe only reason to eat here is if you are shopping at Ikea, very hungry, and have one of their special discounts - that's it
5
This is a very good shopping place for families especially to relax on a lazy Sunday. Besides, the food is tasty and affordable too!
3
the hotdog is cheap and good
3
Love the meatballs.
3
value for money comfort food
4
the chicken wings were great as usual and the swedish meatballs were my wife's favorite
and the coffee powerful! don't drink it if you intend to sleep. the last time my mum drank it, she couldn't sleep!
4
Giant hotdogs, the best chicken wings, and a sinful Daim tart
3
Very good price-quality, certainly the Malaysian food counter
4
SWISS! yeah i just like this thoh their branches are damn far but really nice and the price is right!
4
Love the juicy meatballs and finger licking fried chickens. The nasi padang is good too. Value for money. It can get really crowded during weekends but hey, when parking is free thats where the crowd going to be. The only problem is you have got to enter the store to get to the food place and make your out again thru' the maze and pick few things up along the way! Good marketing indeed.

OK, I was not expecting to write a review of IKEA (Tampines Branch) but after writing a different review, a request to review nearby restaurants popped up - and there was IKEA on the list. IKEA restaurant? Come on! Well, it is OK for a quick meal and the Swedish meatballs taste the same at every IKEA on the Planet. You would not see any noodles or chilli in the European IKEA branches though.There is something worth mentioning however. If you are shopping at Courts or Giant in Tampines, the restaurant in Giant has more options than the one in IKEA, even if the Giant food is so-so. But, IKEA run a shuttle bus from Tampines, Bedok, Pasir Ris and Seng Kang MRT stations to the Tampines IKEA. A regular , free, service. Free! In Singapore! Amazing. That alone almost makes it worth while going for a meal at IKEA. That and a flat-pack wardrobe, of course
2
economical price & nice
3
The meatballs are better than the salmon. Pretty expensive though for the food you get. The place is also super toxic! Quite difficult to get a table.
4
Always a delight to visit the cafeteria in IKEA...

Meatballs (and laksa!)
