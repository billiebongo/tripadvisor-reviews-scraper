One of my fav dishes is the mee goreng!!! Most of the time, my colleagues and I wld share a plate of mee goreng and then other dishes. We usually drive there and love it cuz is free parking.

Serve reasonably pricing for lunch and dinner. Variety option and highlight recommend chef selection such like signature dish "ultraman Chicken" (salted eggs fried chicken), curry fish head, "wu xiang" spring roll and etc.

Went to this restaurant to celebrate girl friend sister birthday, there is indoor and outdoor alfresco setting. The indoor is with aircon and it is quite cold inside, the restaurant is located in Yeo Building, nearest MRT is Labrador Park and within walking distance. If you drive the car park is free though. The restaurant is quite crowded, food ordering is through a paper, the food served is fast, however not sure whether the waiter is all new, the few of them looked blur and don't really know the seating arrangement of the table. Food served is fast and delicious, especially the salted egg chicken. If got the chance definitely will be back to visit again, highly recommended

We've been here a number of times but yesterday's experience was bad. No drinks or food was served for 30 mins until I reminded them. Beer was flat and when I told them, a man (whom I've never seen before) came to ask what the problem was. When I told him the beer was flat, he made like it wasn't the restaurant's fault. When pressed further, he reluctantly brought another bottle, only after giving me the impression he was doing me a favor (the equivalent of not admitting liability or fault in the legal sense). The 3-egg spinach was tasteless, as were the crab meat tofu, and veg. The coffee pork was not fragrant. Ultraman chicken was reasonable, as was bikini chicken. No apology was offered but it didn't matter. It's our last trip there...

Housed in an old rustic Buddhist Retreat Centre with a spacious carpark, this che char restaurant is usually crowded, noisy, well patronised and busy. Do not expect courteous service nor a romantic setting. So if you prefer to eat in the comfort of your own home, you would do well to place your orders on line in advance, and collect your dishes. They cook a very good spicy fish head curry, steamed ginger chicken, Seafood horfun, Si Ji Do French beans, Ultraman chicken. Did not like the coffee pork ribs as it had a strong chemical taste. The sambal sweet potato leaves were too spicy

No logic that my order of slice fish with rice didn’t come with the fried egg as indicated in the picture on the menu. When queried, the staff said it is their policy that no egg will be added to the dish on Sat / Sun. She said that the menu has stated as such. (When I checked the menu, yes indeed it’s indicated but in fine print). The staff should have reminded the customer of this policy when accepting the order. The reason given was that usually, due to the crowd on weekend, the Chef has no time fired the egg. But why they didn’t reduce the price; the price remained the same at $6. Very disappointed and will not be going back again.

Review by DrSim001. A bit out of the way for tourists to go on their own. However, restaurant claims to have tour groups having meals there. Good Food. Restaurant is in between 2 MRT stations. Service is basic but acceptable. Air-conditioned. Ambience is basic. Crockery is basic. Chinese Tea Pot Handle is made of make shift raffia string. The dishes that are good are: Coffee Pork, Ultraman Chicken, Prawn Roll, Pumpkin Tofu. Regards DrSim00

Went to Sum Kee restaurant at Telok Blangah Street. Small place frequented mostly by locals. Try to sit outside if you can take the heat. Inside there's air-conditioning, but you'll notice the smell of food distinctively. Great Singapore chinese food. Had chilli crab, sliced fish with vegetables, black bean sauce and several other dishes. Reasonable prices. Recommend this restaurant

Overrated and disappointed dinner at Sum Kee's new branch at 19 Yung An Road (formerly the Thai Sharksfin Restaurant). Ordered their Signature dishes - Curry Fish Head, XO Sum Lor Hor Fun, Ultraman Chicken and Pumpkin Tofu.. regretfully only the Pumpkin Tofu has it's own unique savoury taste and the rest are letdown !The XO Sum Lor came "without the XO" and luckily I noticed that and asked the waitress if they have send us the correct dish ? This dish went back to the kitchen and came back with just only the "additional XO toppings" ... I thought XO Sum Lor is cooked differently from the usual Sum Lor Hor Fun... or is it not ?Even the restaurant is not filled up at the time we went at 6pm, the waitress kept sending us the wrong order to our table... twice to be exact without explanation nor apology ! Poor service and overrated food which I personally felt does not deserve the high recommendations ! Will be my 1st and last time at this Sum Kee branch unless there's an improvement in quality of food and service. There are better and cheaper Zi Tzar stalls at the nearby Taman Jurong Blk 399 Hawker Center..

I felt like Alice in Wonderland. My friend drove. We were driving through a HDB estate of high rise housing and suddenly, after a couple of turns, we stepped back in time and were in this small carpark with a couple of old low rises.The restaurant looked like one out of the sixties.The restaurant serves zhi char. Really good! The Ultraman chicken (fried chicken in salted egg) was really yummy, matched by the coffee pork ribs. As a nod to healthy food, we had the 3 egg spinach (average), salted vegetable soup (ok) and hot plate tofu (can't complain). To be fair, the healthy options did not stand out after our palates were subject to the really yummy meat dishes that were fatty and savoury.

This is a no frills restaurant with an old decor but a huge beer garden to boot.
The food are a classic staples of a melting pot of cultures of a metropolitan city

Economical place for good food and casual dinner. Staffs are friendly and quick to response. Several nice dishes n portions are good for price paid.
5
This place serves great food for any occasion. Their Ultraman chicken, coffee glaze pork are of the 2 best dishes so far. If you still have room for desert, do try their yam paste with gingko to finish up your meal!

Had a nice lunch with a colleague. My first time there. I especially enjoyed the salted egg chicken. We also ordered 铁板豆腐 and 豆苗. The free parking and many lots are also plus points. Might consider bringing my family here for makan if happen to be nearby

Thanks to friends familiar with this joint, we were able to enjoy a slice of Singapore Chinese food like in the 1970s when eateries were still located in one storey houses surrounded by a large vacant plot of land. Such scenes are rare in this metropolis.The spacious and quiet surrounds is a stark contrast to the busy interior packed with local diners dressed in casuals. They vibe is relaxed and busy with large family groups who seemed to know their way around the place and menu. We left the ordering to friends and ended up with a table of delicious eats including coffee pork ribs, deep-fried chicken skin, sambal sweet potato leaves, curry fish head and deep fried squid. We finished the meal with steamed rice. The food was delicious and the bill was less than $90 with drinks. We're definitely adding this establishment to our list of good Singapore Chinese eats.

Our team secretary recommended this place. No regrets after our lunch!Have to say that no one would have thought that there would be a restaurant operating at this place (Yeo's Building - its like a clan association and temple like structure along telok blangah road - opposite the Keppel Club)We ordered:Yusheng (large portion)ultraman chicken (chix bits deep fried with saled eggsbeef with onionsCoffee pork chopqing long cai (green dragon chives)Fish head currySpecial deep fried doufu (mixed with fish paste and water chestnut)PrawnsStir fried Kai LanDesserts (gui ling gao, longan with beancurd and fried ice cream)The food was simply delicious and we just "whacked" each dish as they were served.The service was very good and very friendly. The staff attended to us to organize the preparation of the yusheng dish and also wished us with the traditional Chinese New Year greetings.The place is spacious and comfortable. Also air-conditioned. There is ample parking. The only drawback is that it is not so accessible by public transport such as MRT. The nearest is Pasir Panjang Station (near ARC/Alexandra Rd) and its a long walk away (may around 800m). Will can come back to eat again with friends and family and try other food items that have been highly recommended by other guest (as shared over other reviews

In stark contrast to the various dining options at nearby Vivo-city and the southern end of Alexandra Rd, this kampong-style restaurant is a great "secret" to share with people who think they've dined everywhere in Singapore.Good Chinese food. Prompt service. Good value. And a fascinating place that feels quite "Ulu" but is only just off Keppel Viaduct

This is another place to add to the list of places where the whole family can eat and the dog can come too. We telephoned in advance about the dog and there is a table, amongst others outside, that is just a little bit on its own so the dog can sit quietly by your feet without disturbing others. The range of Chinese food is vast and varied. This restaurant has been established for a few years and is off the beaten track. We saw the signs by chance enroute to the nearby shopping precinct and decided to try it tonight. It's popular with locals, not so much with Westerners and gets busy. Parking is good (and free).Tipswet wipes are $1 each and they tried to charge us including two 1-year old babies (who had their own wet wipes for other reasons.) just return them to not get charged.They have a special called Cinderella Pumpkin. It's probably called that because the price is $22 and it goes up in smoke before you know it. I didn't think this dish was worth the price tag (I guess it's all about the money money money)They have a buzzer on the table so you wont be ignored being outside. They showed up very soon after we pressed the button.We have a local place on South Buona vista that offers similar fayre and we would probably opt for that out of the two restaurants for several reasons. Food is about the same quality at both places but this place is a little more expensive, though still nice and worth a family night out

This restaurant is tucked away from the main road, and has seating indoors and outside, amidst a garden. Indoor seating is air-conditioned and offers large tables for party of 10 with lazy Susan. Seating is limited indoors, so booking is recommended for large parties or if you want air-conditioning. Outdoor parking is free.The decor is basic, harking back to the 1970s. You order your food by check off the item on a list and handing it to the waitstaff who are efficient albeit lacking a little in friendliness (typically Singaporean). The food is simple but hearty home cooked fare. We ordered 3 noodle dishes to share (very large for one person), the sliced fish noodle was good. The pork rib dish we ordered was nicely fried, soft yet crunchy on the outside with a spicy sauce. The vegetables (pea shoots fried with garlic) were cooked just right. The hot plate tofu went down well with the kids. Food was well seasoned and tasty, and reasonably priced. Good for a simple family meal out

Great food, love the Beef Curry. It's abit pricey for the ambience and location. Always crowded during weekend dinner time. Service standards normally take a dip during busy periods. Don't bother making reservations, they'll take ur reservation but gives u any available table, thus it's the same waiting time as walk-in guest
5
Local place, food is excellent and good value. Must try the Ultraman Chicken - salted egg chicken, very nice. Also the 3 egg vegetable, excellent. Drinks are very reasonable too at around 1.50 each- lots of choices. Near Labrador Park

If you are in the area, this is a good Chinese restaurant with a good range of dishes cooked well. There is ample parking in quiet surroundings.
4
Simple but delicious food where many locals eat. This is the kind of place which interrest me always whenever I travel. If you see locals go there, it must be good. Their foods are really value for money.

Been passing by the road for many years and didn't know there is such a jem here. Went here with colleagues 9 of us and ate around SGD300. Not your fancy posh restaurant stuff but the food is good and some even unique like the fried chicken skin! Nice! After food there is an outdoor area where we chilled for a while. They only had Carlsburg and we thought they should offer a couple more brands. Service was normal and there is plenty of their own free parking lots. I was told to avoid the weekend crowds

Service is swift and professional. The chilli crab has a sauce that's a bit sweeter and hotter than other places, the oats prawns and sweet and sour fish are excellent, and the lemon chicken is among the best I've had. A filling meal here will not blow a whole in your pocket. A reservation, if dining during peak times, would be advisable

Food: averageLocation: average but ample parkingPrice: reasonableService: averageThere is one thing that I do not like, smoking zones. Look. You have a huge area and if other restaurants do not allow smoking at the dinner table, why can't u? Its not as if your indoor space is huge.Food wise, I'd recommend chicken with salted egg and coffee pork ribs.
4
Good variety of food. 4 adults 5 children of us had around 8 dishes: claypot fish, crab cooked two ways, garlic chicken, vege, tauge, fried Malay mee, and kuey teow. Flavorsome, fresh, and filling. Service was fast. Relaxing ambiance. Spent around 175 dollars for that meal. Would recommend

When we visited this restaurant, we had little expectation as the food list was mostly the same as any other similar restaurants in Singapore. First impression was that the service was above average and fast. What really impressed us the quality of the food. Their "Ultraman Chicken" - salted egg with chicken - was pretty unique and delicious. The Prawn Sauce Chicken went well with their chilli sauce. Curry fish head was also good.Overall, the price was very reasonable for the quality of food

Wasn’t easy to arrange a lo-hei dinner at my or sibling’s place, so we decided to have our reunion dinner at a restaurant instead.Many restaurants only have set menus and the sets average $800+ for a good restaurant. I thought of Sum Kee and they had a dinner set for $500+. The menu looked alright and we booked it for CNY eve. There were 2 seatings: 5.30pm and 7.30pm. We opted for 7.30pm, as the earlier slot was too early and we had to finish our meal before 7.30pm. The aircon area was full when I made the booking a month before the date, so we ended up on the alfresco area.The set menu included:- Prosperity Yu Sheng: Tossing of the raw fish salad is for good luck. Smoked salmon were used here and tossed with the julienned vegetables in a tangy sauce. - Braised Sharks Fin with Crabmeat: Sharks fin soup with fish maw and crab meat. Soup is starchy and portion was more than sufficient for 10 pax.- Wallet Chicken: Whole boneless chicken stuffed with glutinous rice, mushrooms and preserved Chinese sausages, then deep fried. All of us loved this, as it was a unique dish.- Braised Pig Trotter: Braised whole pig trotter in a starchy braised sauce. Meaty and substantial portion.- Steamed Red Garoupa: Steamed and drizzled with a soya sauce and topped with julienned spring onions. It was alright.- Cereal Prawns: Deep-fried peeled prawns coated with cereal batter mix. It was alright.- Bai Lin Gu with Brocolli: sliced mushrooms with brocolli in a starchy sauce. Not bad.- Ee Fu Noodles: I find the noodles a little dry. Would have preferred the noodles to have more sauce during the frying process. - Mango Pudding: This was not exactly mango pudding, but tasted like almond tofu and topped with mango syrup. Not impressed with this.Comparing my previous experience of dining here, I find the food quality this time round commendable, as it’s the busy Chinese New Year period and the chef has to work hard to prepare and serve all the food orders in a timely and efficient manner

I have driven past Telok Blangah Road countless times. Located opposite Keppel Club is Yeo's Building, which houses a Chinese restaurant. I came by with my family for lunch to try out their food. Ultraman chicken: $12 for small portion - With a 'superhero' name for a dish, it lives up to expectations. This is essentially 'popcorn chicken' where chicken is cut into bite sized pieces, deep fried and tossed with salted egg yoke sauce. The food is served piping hot and best eaten while its hot! Must-order!Johor Hokkien Mee: $4 for small portion - I was longing for the KL style Hokkien Mee, and this was more of the Hokkien Mee that you can find in most cze-char stalls in Singapore. The sauce is not to thick and the noodles had fish cake and prawns in them. Most importantly, it also had pork lard!Sum Loh Hor Fun: $6 for small portion - This was not bad. kway teow fried with bean sprouts and sliced fish pieces. The food here is good and I have found a new haunt to bring my family and friends for good makan. Parking is also free!Lots of stuff on their menu, so plenty to order over many occasions
