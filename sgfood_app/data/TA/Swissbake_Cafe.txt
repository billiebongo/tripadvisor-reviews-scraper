Poor food, coffee is diluted.
Service is bad.
Open seating concept... no ambience to talk about.
Skip !!

Went for lunch. They have salad, sandwiches etc. Similar to cafe. Good coffee and nice bread. Cozy seats. Water is free and you can fill it yourself.

Great place for lunch and a place for friends to lunch together. Not good for big groups. The menu does get tired if you eat there on a few occasions

This place has consistently the best flaky and fresh croissants. I am addicted! Friendly service and recently renovated seating area. Great place!

Affordable price with good portions of food. Ordered the smoked duck sandwich (?) if i'm not wrong. Sandwich is filled with the duck meat and it was really good. Great seasoning and goes well with the mushroom soup that was sold as a side combo. The Iced chocolate are good too!A great place to dine for breakfast or brunch and just chill with friends/ family

This was near the hotel where we were staying so it was convenient for us and we found this place early on in our stay. We went back a couple of times and the service was always good and the pastries on offer were quite reasonably priced and tasty. the coffee did vary in quality depending on the barista. We generally found that the girls in this establishment were better at making coffee than the guys. Good place to just "pop in" for morning or afternoon tea. Their menu wasn't extensive enough to stay for a meal

When you go there over lunch you can enjoy a 'kraftwich' sandwich in a variety to your liking, with a daily soup and a coffee, tea or soft drink for a decent price.You are served by friendly and efficient staff, and usually find a place to sit down listening to background music while you feast on your meal - which by the way is fresh and tasty
