I ordered a double espresso, got a single in a dirty cup. Also why is a long black more expensive than a double espresso anyway? Anyways the cashier was nice.

Wafu Hamburg Don is one of the best meal you cannot resist! Heavenly meal! Comfy in the lively ambience of Garden by the Bay. Free wifi.
4
This location is where you buy your tickets and there is an information centre and a Maccers next door.
The food is ok. I had some very nice cheesecake, reasonably priced at $7. Large cap' $5.50, pretty cheap for the Gardens.
Service was good.
1
Terrible experience. Set promotion with 4 slices of toasts came to be one toast plus chips... at the cost of 14 dollars including an hot drink.
Muffins ok but can't believe were hand crafted.
3
This cafe is next door to a Macdonalds so there is a constant bustle in front of the cafe. If like me you like nice coffee and people watching this cafe ticks both boxes.
5
Food and service were exceptional. Great for an afternoon refuel stop. I had a mozzarella and tomato sandwich which was very tasty. My pot of tea was also very refreshing. The man who served us made sure we were satisfied with our meal.
3
I was really looking forward to eating breakfast here prior to starting the full day of garden touring. The line was long at 0900 on a Sunday morning, and I ordered a ham and cheese toastie on brioche bread...and it was good but a bit expensive for what you get.I'd still eat here when coming back to the garden though
3
Cute cafe. As anywhere else...prices are a bit much. The sandwich I wanted one ingredient they were out of... disappointing. The ham & cheese that I ended up ordering was a bit skimpy on ingredients in the sandwich and came with all broken chips. Staff were nice
4
This is a nice cafe with an appetising western menu. I had some ham and cheese toasties on delicious brioche bread, but weirdly they were served with crisps which were stale... probably a bit overpriced for what you get in all. But then most stuff at the gardens is expensive.
5
Me and my Dad had decided to visit Gardens by the Bay and as you enter and proceed towards the ticketing counter, you'll pass two cafes, namely - Cafe Crema and McCafe. We decided to go to Cafe Crema. It's a nice cozy place, usually packed with people. Their service is fast, coffee is amazing and so are the delicacies they serve.Before the long walk inside the domes, this was a refreshing stop. The rains added to the warm atmosphere inside the Cafe :)
5
Very friendly & courteous staff, fresh, delicious food, cooked well too. Good pricing. Recommended. Manager Wong is most helpful to us Aussies.
4
Nice place to stop for some refreshment when visiting the gardens by the bay. Free wifi and reasonable prices.
5
The staff was polite and service was good. I ordered a coffee and some cakes and they came quite fast. Nothing to complain about
2
Picture of waffle (round and looks like hand made) and actual one (4 square pieces) totally different. Was not even warm.
4
One of the best flat white I've gotten so far in Singapore. It's located in the marina bay gardens..................
5
Probably the most decent coffee I've had since arriving in Singapore. Very friendly service. Air conditioning provides a lovely break from heat.
4
Definitely worth a try! Cappuccino and sandwich tasted yum and fresh! Courteous staff and quick service
3
Cafe looks inviting from the outside but disappointing food and expensive. Coffee was good - smooth but food - I chose from a photo and it didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t look anything like it. Just a bowl of rice with a beef burger on it. The eggs benedict was better but took a long time to serve.
2
The first kind of sandwich we ordered was off because they'd run out of guacamole; the second was bland to the point of being tasteless. And it was grossly overpriced, even for this premium location. We also weren't taken by the pushy manager. Wouldn't go back
4
This place is at the entrance/drop off of Gardens by the Bay. it is next to a McDonalds and offers a clear food choice against the fast food chain. There are other restaurants in the Gardens but none so close and accessible to the entrance/exit.They have sandwiches made to order, lots of desserts pre-made and a wide variety of coffee/tea drinks. Prices were medium compared to other touristy areas/restaurants in the city. I found the service friendly and prompt. Remember that this is a quick grab and go, not a restaurant to go dine in. The day I was there was very hot and humid and ducking into this place before I started my tour of the Gardens made perfect sense. Also, nice cool air conditioning without the frenetic big crowd of the McDonald's next door
1
Not recommended. Do yourself a favor and walk to McDonalds. The coffee has no taste! Terrible terrible terrible.
3
Ordered a bento $16 and sandwich set $14. Comes with coffee. The food is average but over priced. Also discovered the bento box bottom is badly scratched.
3
In the parc so not cheap and not the best but definitely a nice coffee and some small western bites.. ðŸŒ»
3
Asked and paid for a double espresso. Got a single. Complained but they just didn't care. The cup wasn't even half full.
4
A proprietor committed to offering great service and value to all of his customers.
A refuge from the rain became a very pleasant lunchtime experience.
5
Throughly recommend Cafe Crema for the first class service, excellent food and especially the coffee choice. This is a far superior place to enjoy a welcome break than the nearby McDonalds.
5
Had hot coffee, iced coffee and food here and a great conversations with Wong who told us all about the local Singapore aspirations and history, very interesting. Small portions but most of Singapore is the same. We would go there again. ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Š
2
Expensive and the food portions are very small. There is not much choice so if you don't want to have a Macdonalds you need to go there
4
Nice place to eat in Gardens by the Bay. Food is modestly priced, but really good quality. Is a nice and quiet cafe that I'd recommend for a lunchtime meal before going to see the Gardens. Service was quite fast and pleasant staff. Overall, would recommend
4
After seeing the long queue outside McDonalds we decided to grab a table at Cafe Crema and have dinner. We had the Gardens By The Bay salads with chicken and salmon. Beautiful meal with a full salad plate. The air conditioning much appreciated as was the free wifi.
5
best coffee in Singapore with apple pie, made on premises.
Great location, good service and staff very handy for advice about Singapore and environs .. will return
4
I came with my girlfriend to Cafe Crema and ordered Eggs Benedict. Overall taste was fine, but poached egg too overcooked. Lattes were fine, though.
3
Because of its position near the entrance, this place gets busy. Best to get your refreshments elsewhere.
3
Great for a quick bite at the park and more available seating than the McCafe next door!
Decent sized regular portion sandwiches.
5
I enjoyed my sandwich which was served quite quickly. The service staff was also friendly and efficient. Great stop after walking around.
3
Tried their hot Hazelnut Latte and their chocolate fudge. The serving of the Hazelnut Latte is relatively small (height of the cup is as tall as the length of my index finger) however, it's somewhat understandable as coffee is not meant to quench your thirst anyway. The taste is not something to really write home about as the latte I ordered is decent but you will probably find better, bigger sized (for those who need it) coffee from Starbucks and CBTL. As for the cake, it's also pretty average. At least it tastes like chocolate. The cake is a tad dry which crumbles into pieces when you use a fork to cut.The view is pretty good though. The cafe is in Garden By The Bay, so it's expected for the view to be somewhat decent. The environment in the cafe is good. Music being played in the cafe is alright although this is very subjective. The most important thing was the volume at which the music is being played. It's loud enough to fill the occasional silence but not enough where it would disrupt the conversations that I was having. That's something not a lot of cafes are able to do. Kudos to whoever that was in charge of it.Service was alright. Nothing much to say/complain. If I was nitpicky, I'd say the staff there could smile a little more.Pricing is pretty subjective as it's up to the person to decide if it's worth the money to spend. Personally, I find the prices are a little steep for the quality of the coffee and cake (SGD$6.50 and SGD$8.50 respectively) but just being able to have a place to sit and have a conversation with someone while having coffee and cake makes it alright. Of course, it would be better if there was an increase in quantity or a decrease in price for the coffee. For the cake, nothing much could be done but to lower the price to match its quality.Overall, Cafe Crema is a perfect place to have a conversation with someone. But if you are looking for a good place to have a meal in, you might need to look elsewhere
4
We called into CafÃƒÂ© Crema for a refreshing hot drink whilst visiting the Gardens by the Bay. Very quick service and friendly staff. Mr Wong, the Outlet Manager, took the time to speak with us and gave us some very useful tips on Singapore. Couldn't have asked for better service. Delicious chocolate muffins too
3
We had lunch there while visiting the Gardens by the Sea. Well I say we had lunch - my husband did but I was struggling to find anything to eat that wasn't wheat heavy and huge. My husband had a ham and cheese toastie which I had a morsel of and that was very nice. But the meals were too big and the price only reasonably if you got a 'meal deal' with a drink. I'd rather fairer pricing for each item without feeling you have to buy extras. The location isn't that great. You are near the Supertrees but really you're on the edge of a wide roadway so it feels quite stark
1
Stopped in for a cold coffee beverage while on a lovely stroll through the garden. I have no problems paying 7.5 SGD (5.3 USD) for a good cup of coffee, but this iced mocha fell below the quality of gas station coffee. There was hardly any chocolate flavor and I could barely taste coffee through the added milk. I would recommend buying overpriced goods elsewhere
5
Went to garden by bay for a walkIt was raining heavily thus dropped by.. the cafe was quite crowded.. nonetheless the service was quite prompt.. and staffs were friendly despite busy... ordered a cake set with coffee.. the coffee was better than any other cafe in singapore ...everything is good except that wifi is a quite slow (perhaps too much users).. will visit again...
4
It s a nice place, very comfortable. The food is very good. I recommend the salmon. Good ambient. Free wii fii.
4
Excellent choice
Would repeat
Air-con a must in a day like this one.
Cosy, Nice, tasty, good value for price.
5
Lovely fresh salad rolls, quiche, focaccia and cold drinks. Reasonably priced, air conditioned. Catch shuttle service tram directly outside cafe.
5
The staff was friendly and the service was good. We have no idea why the previous reviews were bad about this place. It's squeaky fast and good in service.

After a few hours viewing the spectacular Gardens By The Bay, we called into Cafe Crema for lunch. Unfortunately they fell well short of the high standards we had experienced at GBTB.For a start, we were forced to stand at the counter while the staff went about their other duties (clearing tables etc) completely ignoring us. 2 of them walked right by without even an acknowledgement.Secondly, their prices are ridiculous. $6 each for coffee and hot chocolate - and $14 for a very ordinary Chicken Udon. The coffee by the way was served in a glass about half the size of a standard coffee cup, which means I drank it in 30 seconds flat. When I tried to order another, the waitress curtly told me... "you'll have to order it from the counter" What...? I have to stand up and walk to the counter because she couldn't be bothered. No thanks
2
Came here for a quick afternoon coffee and also asked for a babyccino for my toddler. In addition to my already overpriced flat white ($6), they charged me $3 for a tiny cup of plain frothy milk for my child! When I questioned this and pointed out that in most cafes it was free or $1 at most, the man at the counter sarcastically responded "How do you expect us to give it for free? Everyone will be coming here for free babyccinos". I let him know that he was being rude and he apologised, but this type of service won't really make me return
3
We were looking for a quick lunch. None of the dining options around had any atmosphere and all were crowded. We didn"t want fried food. We came here as they had Donburi but I would;t call them a genuine donburi. Mine as a hamburger bun os face with a bit of salad. The combo price with a coffee was fine; service was quick and the coffee was a 3.5/5. As previous reviews have said...dirty. Tables aren"t cleared - but then it doesn"t help when customers were bringing in their Mcdonalds from next door!! Given the poor choices at the Gardens - I would go back if I needed a quick bite
3
We stopped by Cade crema for breakfast while visiting the gardens. We ordered a ham and cheese sandwich on toasted brioche. Unfortunately they didn't have brioche so it came on a regular role which the staff explained when we ordered. We bought a croissant for our one year old which was stale and very hard. Compared to the other restaurants in the gardens we tried this was a disappointment. The staff however, were exemplary. Courteous and helpful
2
I guess the staff must be overwhelmed with the crowds in the cafe. The service is literally non-existent, and the counter staff has a permanent frustrated look on his face. I ordered a coffee for takeaway and waited for quite long. The cafe is understaffed and tables were not cleared. The two star rating is for the coffee and muffin
1
Started the day looking forward to spending time at Gardens By The Bay (which is brilliant). We ordered breakfast, the croissant was stale and they begrudgingly offered a replacement. Eggs Benedict was full of oil and hollandaise sauce and basically inedible . Refused a refund and only offered a replacement . Place was dirty and clearly hadn't been cleaned properly from the night before as we could see old chips on the floor which aren't served at this hour. When we complained we were told the croissant was fresh which clearly it wasn't although the replacement was fresh. Complaints about the cleanliness were explained only as being due to the lack of staff. Suggest to avoid this place as the food and staff attitude were terrible. We wish we'd left and walked over to Satay by the bay which we visited later at lunchtime and was far better
2
The Japanese sets were reheated probably several times, salad are fresh but pricy, coffee are ok, atmosphere is ok.
3
Disappointing experience having to sit at a table full of previous occupants dirty dishes and left overs. Only removed once my table order was delivered. Others also shared the same fate.
The food was nice and fresh..
Would I return ? ...probably not
5
Great place to chill.
Love the coffee
Staffs were enthusiastic
Coffee and Cakes were nice
Nothing to complain about
4
Clean, friendly staff and good service. Prices are not bad either.
Nice place to sit down for a while and have a cup of coffee or some other refreshments. The service was good and we enjoyed.
Thanks!
2
I recommend you avoid this place. We had a very disappointing experience. Up front I will say that I don't think it's the fault of the staff, but rather the management and basic logistics. Our experience included:- eggs benedict unavailable- skim milk was rancid (the staff replaced the coffee)- way overpriced breakfast - sub-standard offerings, including the coffeeBut it could be so good! You'd think having a McCafe next door would force them to be competitive but no such luck
1
Ordered eggs Benedict, wagu beef pattie don and 1 coffee, cost S$38. The eggs on eggs Benedict was over-cooked, and the hollandaise sauce was lumpy and tasted nothing like hollandaise. The beef patty on the beef don was too dry and rice too wet. All in, most horrible food even for both starving people, and very dissatisfying. A total rip-off
3
So this place is great because of their location to people watch although their air conditioning was a bit cold. They have an educational thing to talk about their coffee. The eggs benedict wasn't great. Normally during lunch it seems they have good selection of sandwiches.
1
Ordered a teriyaki chicken don and blueberry cheesecake. The teriyaki chicken tastes like it's microwaved and true enough another review confirmed my suspicion. As for the blueberry cheesecake, it also looks and tastes like microwave food. Taste really bad. We should have gone MacDonald's next door - at least the MacDonald's pancake definitely taste better!Never coming back again
2
I had always wanted to go and try out Cafe Crema because of it's menu. I had researched it online and saw it had a wide range choices from pasta to sandwiches. I was greatly disappointed when I went there. First of all, they had re-vamped their menu and had not updated their online one so I went on the impression that their old menu was still valid. I wanted to try their pastas but imagine my disappointment when I saw they didn't have pasta anymore but Japanese bentos?! I was already starving so I thought let's just try what they were marketing. We ordered a Teriyaki Chicken Don and Teriyaki Salmon Don. Both were super disappointing till I couldn't bother to take a photo of it. The Salmon Don was the worst because it was sooo dry and difficult to swallow. I saw the staff prepping the meals and they had taken these ingredients out from air sealed bags and microwaved them. It's really something prepared out from a home kitchen where the staff really need not put in any effort to the overall dish. Worst of all, those 2 boxes of bentos cost nearly SGD 14 dollars!!!! I left unsatisfied and I definitely won't recommend dinning there
1
Got caught for a quick breakfast bite , we have been in Singapore a week and this was by far the worst place we have eaten , luke warm coffee, shocking fruit bun my wife asked for butter that had a flavour of onion and garlic, made her feel ill for the rest of our day. Most unusal for a Singapore food outlet.Dont bother to got here, (Maccas is next door)
3
They had some fine-looking pastries, but we weren't terribly hungry, so split an almond croissant... It was ok. The cafe is convenient to visitors of the gardens, which is why it is very busy, but the service was prompt nonetheless.
3
A nice place to stop for coffee in Gardens by the Bay. Plenty of seats indoors to enjoy the air conditioning, and plenty of choice of coffee.
1
They served me raw chicken. My family of three ordered one bento box each. Unluckily, I got the chicken. The staff apologized and replaced with salmon. Still, the damage was done, I ate portions of the chicken already. Btw, the taste was not that good.
2
We popped in for breakfast. The egg benedict in the menu was not available as the staff explained that they hv no time to prepare and the person responsible for egg poaching was absent frm work. This was despite having 4 trays of eggs lying idly on the shelf. Even then, there were 5 staff around at a time when the cafe was not very crowded. We ordered the Big Ham & Cheese sandwich which consists if two miserable size bread and chips for $17. The sandwich was dry. There were 5 staff in the kitchen and enuff time for small chit chat, clearly the cafe is not over staffed but very under-skilled (eg can't even do a simple fried egg!!).The coffee was average. The reason the cafe is able to survive with such exponentially expensive menu probably due to tourists. Food is considered expensive if the decent composition and serving is not accorded. We hv been to decent busy cafes managed by staff strength of 3 within the city area serving a mean breakfast set.This plc is highly not recommended unless one doesnt mind the run of the mill service where the staff exhibits almost no pride in ensuring the cafe works, other than being paid fixed salaries not knowing the F&B is highly competitive and they could be out of job in no time if the cafe cannot survive viably
3
After we got in we wanted a little break before we started to walk around the gardens and thought this place would be perfect for s snack and coffee. The drinks are way overprice $6 for a very small latte and it wasn't that good. They were out of several things so we couldn't get a snack.
2
The dining area near the supertree was closed for private event, leave us no choice but tried Cafe Crema. Didnt have a good experience though. Ordered their salad and chicken bento. quite costly for a small portion of salad and the chicken was not welly cooked
4
Tucked away by the coach park and taxi stand, it is very easy to miss this place. The food is really good, prices reasonable, and service is great!It's a nice place for a bite after walking around in the Gardens. They do have wifi, just ask the service staff for the password.If you're a member of the Gardens, you get a discount. Just flash your membership card
4
After a heavy lunch, I needed a coffee to perk me up. Saw this cafÃ©, I popped in and got myself an Iced Coffee.The coffee is nice and overall taste is good. Good for a quick â€˜pick me upâ€™, a good alternative to the usual chain coffee cafes
4
You are in the Gardens by the Bay, so you don't expect ultra cheap. I had the daily set--salmon, tomato, and lettuce on rye, with coffee--for $12. The sandwich was fresh, the bread excellent, and the coffee satisfying. With free wifi and air conditioning, a pleasant interlude to my garden visit. Easy to miss: next to a McDonalds a bit away from the main ticket booth.
4
I came here by chance after having visited the gardens. I decided to try it because it looked way healtier than the McDonald's on its side. I chose an "Italian" sandwich that costed me 19 S $ . I was served at the table and I did not had to wait much, the waitress was gentle. The sandwich was made on the fly and fresh, above all it was much bigger than I expected and so I skipped dinner.
3
We stepped in for a quick bite & ordered a choco roll & a chicken mushroom sandwich. It costed us SGD 21 in total. The food was good but for the price I would the rating closer to average than very good.
3
We had a late breakfast before visiting the domes. We had the bread platter and pancakes with two teas for $36. Only place open so guess they can charge what they want
3
I was walking around the gardens (a definite must do) and was hungry for lunch. It was hot outside and it is air conditioned inside. I ordered the salmon argula sandwich. It was very good but at $20 SGD, it was pretty pricey. Including several drinks to rehydrate, my total for 1 person was getting up there. Service was a little slow to get my sandwich but the staff was friendly. The air conditioning was set pretty low so it felt great
4
I was Westgate, and post lunch, I needed a cuppa for my caffeine fix. I spotted this cafÃƒÂ© on the ground floor of the mall. I headed in to check it out. They have a range of drinks and my friend and I ordered our drinks. - Espresso: $3.50. Coffee has good aroma and the blend is nice. Good tasting. - Piccolo: $4.50. Small cuppa of coffee with milk in a glass. Its my second cup after the espresso. - Gryphon Tea: Osmanthus Sencha: $6.50. My friend had this tea and I tried some. The tea is a unique blend and easy to drink. As it was a rainy day, the cup of tea helped to warm the body.There are some interesting drinks on the menu that caught my eye:- Ice Blended Almond Latte: 7.50- Iced Earl Grey Tea Latte: $6.50As I was too full from lunch and coffee, I will try them next time. Try it
2
I am not one to complain, but this place is your average coffee shop but charging high prices for being located at gardens by the bay.A small cappuccino for 5.5 sgd and a thin slice of cake for 8-9 sgd. On top of that scone was dry.If you can avoid the place, do it
3
The crew was relatively friendly, calling out greetings when we entered. We selected a booth seat and then set about ordering some stuff while waiting for the client / friend.*Alloy had the Apple Crumble (SGD$6.50) - a soft but taut, pie-like crust instead of the flakey, crumbly crust we were expecting. Even the fillings were sticky, with bits of apples and raisins. Overall taste was not bad, not too sweet tinged with sour overtures, but we really thought that the term "Apple Pie" would have been more befitting.I had the Strawberry Shortcake (SGD$7.00) - served to me in a sleeping form. For that price, it was rather small. The cake was soft but coarse, with flavor that you could find in any other neighborhood bakery. It was disappointing, and I wondered if I should have ordered one of the cheesecakes on display instead.To make things worse, my Iced Earl Grey Tea Latte (SGD$7.00) tasted like very diluted latte, with the barest hint of earl grey. I guess the photo depicting the thin veil of drinks herein speaks for itself - I was practically drinking latte-flavored water.For full review and more photographs, please feel free to visit:http://thearcticstar.blogspot.sg/2014/12/tea-break-at-cafe-crema-westgate.htm
3
We chose the place because it looked nice from the outside.. but upon ordering our coffee, we realised that there are only two items on the breakfast menu (the rest of the menu items start at 11130am) - scones and croissant! How disappointing!!The only good thing about coming here before 1130am is that you have a quiet (now I know why so few people!) place and big tables!
3
We stopped by this cafe after visiting the domes at Garden by the Bay. It was mid afternoon, and the cafe had plenty of patrons. Some of the items on the menu were not available. We opted for a light snack of scones and a pot of tea. Both were satisfactory and were reasonably priced. We were able to sit inside and this was pleasant. The staff were helpful.Thanks for your vote if your found this review helpful
1
Don't go here .... We went for breakfast today before going to the domes. Coffee was bitter and tasted like powdered milk at $7 each. Raisin pastry was stale and dry even heated. The worst was the $14 pancakes with fruit, yoghurt and berry coulis. Consisted of ... 3 pikelets heated in the microwave with thick layers of artificially thickened berry sauce, a tablespoon of yoghurt (if that), 3 blueberries and a strawberry cut in half and was tasteless. Eat before you go and save your money. This cost us $40 plus tax. Total ripof
4
Stopped by for a late lunch and really enjoyed the chicken and mushroom ciabatta or "specialist artisan sandwich" as they call it. Fortunately that ostentatious name was the only negative thing about the cafe. The food was beautifully presented and delicious. The water (iced and warm) is free so help yourself. The seats by the window are wide and cushiony, shielded by tropical plants. Service staff was friendly and happily topped up my pot of tea with hot water twice. Great find. I'll be back :
