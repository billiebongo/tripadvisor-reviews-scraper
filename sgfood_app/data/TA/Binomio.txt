Really great food, love the tapas and the ambience. Very happy to return the next time. Highly recommended
5
A well laid out restaurant. The European hostess is real delight. We enjoyed very tasty vegetarian options - tapas and paella. Wine offerings by the glass were very decent from both a taste and price points of view. We definitely recommend this restaurant.
5
Food is delectable as always. Love the taste and the white sangria was a great accompaniment. Definitely a good choice to celebrate a close friend’s birthday :)
5
The service, menu, good and wine were superb. The chicken croquettes were a favorite item to share as was the pluma. I’d highly recommend Binomio.
4
A cost Restaurant for big groups. There is a casual bar seating if you like to dine alone or as couple. Best squid ink paella in town. Excellent service team.
5
Great as always, Binomio deliver the same quality on lunch or dinner. Lunch is more affordable and quiet. Great for business discussions.
5
Nice restaurant with good lighting and quiet atmosphere. Went there with family (4 adults and one child). We went for 5 tapas to share as an entry and a paella to share for main dish.Tapas were all very well presented, quite tasty and appreciated by all of us (gamba, scallops, griller vegetables, scallops, pork belly)Chicken and seafood paella was also great. Well cooked, tasty and good size for a dish to share.As drink, we took a red sangria: very well done as well. Fruity and light in alcohol.Overall, a great experience. I do recomment this place
4
Restaurant was quite full when we reached and glad that we had a reservation. They have a tapas bar for walk-ins if you cant get a table.We had a ‘Coca’ Bread Chorizo for starters and a classic chicken/seafood Paella. The food was delicious and the chirpy dining area added to the weekend vibe.
3
We were a family of 7, 3 teenagers, 2 parents and a grandparent. Service is superb with attentive and friendly staff. We had various tapas, regrettably most of them were too oily, some of them swimming in oil. The squid/ink paella was perhaps our best course as it did not suffer from excess oil. The same problem with the churros, they can be much better
5
We are repeat Guests in Binomio, we simply Love it.We usually seat by the Bar, where you get the Menu selection of different Tapas, great taste, good portions and the Staff is very kind to inform you when you ordered enough food.Service is Amazing, Eduardo the GM is Fantastico! and his Team always make you feel welcome, trully embrazing their warm, Happy Spanish Culture despite their nationality.Food is Great, Service us Great, good location and atmosphere
1
Food tastes terrible, portion sizes were small and expensive, service underwhelming - never going back
5
Just make reservation via chope , no hassle.
Everything is good here . Food , ambiance , service all up to my expectation.
4
Safe bet for Spanish fare, had a few tapas for sharing and they were all good. Portions are on generous side, would recommend 3 plates to start with and add on if nessary.
3
Dishes were good. It was a big shame that they were not served warm. A huge drop in standard since the last time we came. Service and atmosphere were, as before, exceptional.
4
Went there for my wedding anniversary and am please with the service and food there. Went there early and by dinner time .... the place was full house
5
Celebrated my husband’s birthday at Binomio, had the mushroom croquettes, veal cheeks tapas with chorizo and chicken paella. Mushroom croquettes and Veal cheeks were the highlights. Attentive staff, great ambience, overall a fantastic experience. Will definitely visit again.
5
Food and service are always good. Familiar staffs make us feel comfortable every time we go. I will recommend anyone I know to this restaurant.
5
From the moment I stepped into the restaurant I was greeted by smiling and welcoming staff. They were prompt to attend to needs, courteous and so amiable! Having shared with them that it was my wife’s birthday, they even provided a little gift. A thumb drive so beautifully designed. I am unsure as to its capacity but that isn’t the point. It really is the little gestures that go a long way. The food was excellent overall. Warm bread was a tad hard and the insides of the churros a little undercooked for my liking but everything else was just splendid. Highlight of our meal was the chicken, ham and cheese/egg croquettes. I would definitely recommend this Spanish restaurant to couples looking to enjoy a night out or a special occasion.
5
We went back to Binomio for a private catered family event in the evening. It was a spectacular, fun and very well managed party. The staff was attentive and the food and wine and beer were wonderful. So I would highly recommend Binomios for both a large part which they can handle well as well as a small dinner or snack !
5
I was seated at the bar table which given me the chance to meet chef Houssein who is the star of the place. The tapas was great and i had a wonderful dinner while chatting with the chef. I need to try the paella next time ad u was too full just having tapas this time. Cheers
5
A group of 15+ of us came and had the set menu. There were so many food options with the garlic prawns, calamari and paella being the stand outs. Great service too!
5
Great service by the waiter where he recommended us their speciality and of course we were not disappointed by the selection. We were served with a cheese+jam starter.. the croqettas are great! Paella is a must too! Overall great experience and food with my date!
5
Fantastic food: fresh, superb tastes and presentation. Service very good. Ambiance top. Jamon iberico highly recommended as is the tomato and anchofish dish.
5
Truly excellent tapas in a very authentic spanish location. Service in spanish and very good. Pricey
5
The food and service did not disappoint. Portions were decent. Will definitely return. Highly recommended!
5
This place never tires nor disappoints. My favourite Spanish restaurant hands down. I will recommend it to everyone.
4
Service staff were attentive & helpful. Place was a little noisy. Food was a little salty. Good experience overall.
5
Excellent food and service. Had read some so so reviews but our experience (a business dinner for 4) was very good. Would definitely visit again.
5
Normally not a fan of tapas, but Binomio has converted me. We were able to watch Chef prepare his creations for us as we put ourselves in his hands for dinner, and it was indeed stunning. He discussed how he derived the dishes, and something as prosaic as brussel sprouts became quite exceptional with his simple and elegant treatment. The omelette was rich yet not heavy, the croquetas a song and the tiger prawns excellent. For those with an innate interest in food and ingredients and creation of dishes, do try to sit at the bar and watch Chef. Outstanding evening. . . 
3
We had 5 tapas, Squid Ink Paella with clams and calamari, Iberian suckling pig Segovia style, whiskey cake and churros. The better dishes were the slow cooked beef short ribs, mushroom croquettes and the pan fried cray fish with trinchat potatoes. The other dishes didnâ€™t excite the palate. Having eaten here for lunch twice, it was kinda of a letdown. We had a private room which has a minimum spend requirement. Bill came to almost $1k for 7 of us including drinks
4
We love the tapas selection and the quantity of the food is just perfect for sharing. Ambience is also great for celebrations and gathering.
4
Went with friends from overseas. Food quality overall is great and good atmosphere.
8 tapas that allows you to pick and choose from all the menu including dessert is nice!
4
One of the better restaurants serving Spanish food in Singapore.
Service was friendly but the wait for food took a bit long.
5
Food and wine is superb! my boss & the rest of our colleagues enjoy our lunch! ambiance is good too!
5
I like this restaurant very much. I repeat many times. Food is always good and service stuff is always nice and especially I like ambience there. Good for any occasion. I like to go there with friends. I always have Sparkling Sangria!
5
We had a fantastic dinner at Binomio's. This is a restaurant with a beautiful interior and top notch service. They have an ample menu with tapas, and a good selection of wines. Overall really worth a visit.
4
Having reviewed involuntarily under a separate account, will say again food 1st rate & service most genuinely friendly, especially bartender & chef-owner. Expect Michelin star soonest.
4
My recent lunch date to celebrate my 25th wedding anniversary turned out to be a very pleasant experience. The servers were knowledgeable and attentive and helped with recommendations and ensure my wife and I were enjoying our time at the restaurant. Meal doneness, portion, dessert and wine recommendation were spot on......well done !!
5
Binomio was quite an unusual experienc; wife caught cold joining me despite loss of appetite. We sat at encounter ordering only few tapas as we cancelled our booking at the main dining room which offers a much more elaborate menu. All staff was most graceful, kind & cheerful; bar tender especially, and owner-chef greeting & chatting us. Tapas were most satisfying & reasonably priced. Would bet Bionomio getting a Michelin soones
3
We had the 7-tapas tasting menu, which was a lot of food for 4 people.Had a few bright spots but the standard and quality of food fell short for the money, as well as when compared to other big cities like Tokyo and Hong Kong.Standouts were the crab pate (really innovative, peanut butter like spread), cheese terrine, and octopus.Rest of food like the cod and veal meatballs were cold and underdone (bordering on rare... for fish that’s not sashimi), garlic prawns had good flavor but were not the freshest, short ribs were not as expected and tad overdone, also cold (they were served in bite-size slices).Good if overpriced wine list - we tried a couple bottles of different Spanish varietals that we hadn’t seen before. Search for a good tapas place continues
5
The food was amazing especially the beef ribs, cozy atmosphere and friendly staff. Definitely will come back.
5
El mejor restaurante español de Singapur de largo. The best Spanish Restaurant in Singapore hands down.
5
We were a threesome and ordered about eight dishes; not one disappointed. The flavours were sensational. I would love to go back and recommend this one to all.
5
Dropped by for a solitary lunch, the prices were very reasonable for amazing food! Service could be more attentive though.
5
We tried this restaurant on Friday night, the food was excellent (we had the tapas tasting menu) and also the wine was very good!we definitely will come again!
5
If u love the tapas style food , u would love binomio. Its just great and wondeful to try. Oh. Did i mention they also have a great desserts too!!
4
Initally messed up order but fixed it in the end. Overall good. Crayfish wrapped in iberian pork tapas recommended!
5
Absolutely delicious and authentic tapas eaten at the bar of the restaurant, ideal for those who want a more unique experience, and served by a friendly waiter providing good tips and kind services throughout the evening. Ideal place for couples and friends.
4
Dined on a friday night which was bustling with activity. Be sure to make reservations to ensure you get your seats! Service was prompt and attentive. Food was delightful, we ordered the 7 tasting tapas to share among 5 pax, 1/2 portion paella and roasted pork. i'll say stick to the tapas as they do that incredibly well but maybe skip the roasted pork as it fell short of our expectations. the skin wasn't all that crispy and it has a strong, strong gamey smell. and it was one of the more expensive dishes on the menu.
5
This restaurant is the best among the others in the vicinity, having been established for sometime. Those food on the menu are mostly the classic of Catalan cuisine which was delicious and full of flavour. It does bring back memories when I was in Spain. Itâ€™s a place worth dining and coming back
5
delicious tapas and paella. prompt service. restaurant atmosphere is good. good for birthday celebration and gathering.
5
We had some tapas and drinks at the bar which was really enjoyable and tasty. Mushroom croquettes and baby calamari were delightful! Definitely a place to recommend!
5
Enjoyed dinner with friends sharing plates of tapas. We tried lots of dishes and the tiger prawns, hake and crayfish stood out. Didn't catch its name but the ocean aged white wine was quite nice
5
We had not been for a few months. Service and food as outstanding as always. Enjoyed both the tapas and the paella
2
We decided to have drinks after dinner and proceeded to its bar.
Ordered several Gin Tonic and it was disappointing. GT was watered down and its condiments served no purpose to adding its flavor.
There were smokers and was hot and stuffy.
Very unfortunate experience.
4
This was my second visit to Binomio. My first was a few years ago. The food was as good as it was a few years ago. The only dish we didn't like was the paella. We found it too watery. The dessert (whisky cake) was interesting but not something we would order again. The starter (tiger prawns) and 3 tapas (croquette, calamari, and pork belly) were excellent
5
This is a amazing restaurant that is worthy of your attention when looking for a finer authentic Spanish to dine at. it was a very warmth welcoming ,restaurant atmosphere was balanced by contemporary design along with elegance and warmth, the food was really delicious it was my excellent choice of authentic Spanish tapas specially tortillas de potata and chorizo chicken paella .special thanks to server for caring and attentive service
5
The excellent experience started from our reservation, staff called on the day of dinner itself as reminder. Was also pleasantly surprised that there was no cakeage at this place! Waiters and waitresses were friendly and warm too. Now on to the main deal, their tapas is great, really exquisite and an adventure for our taste buds. If any feedback, i would say their food is on the slightly salty end. But really they are really good.Overall, will visit again
5
Recently, wife and I have had cravings for tapas. We've been to My Little Spanish Place, La Ventana, Salt, UNA and La Taperia, but I find Binomio to have the most interesting and delectable tapas.We had the cheese terrine, crispy hake, fried baby calamari, pork belly, crispy Brussel sprouts, grilled cuttlefish and pan fried crayfish. No complaints at all with the selection. Pork belly was above average but nothing fantastic, and my wife and I thought that everything else was fantastic. I especially liked the cuttlefish and hake. Ooh lah lah! Oh yes, and also the ham and cheese croquette and a cold platter. My daughter loved the crayfish and my son loved the croquette and cold platter.Wine selection could be better though. Had cava, rosado, verdelo and Rioja. Only the Rioja stood out.Rated the best tapas I've had so far and will definitely come back for more
4
The tapas, paella and desserts were really good, we will definitely go back for the food.But the service at the entrance wasn't that friendly (but the rest of the team is nice and helpful). When I arrived, I asked the person in charge of welcoming and sitting the guests whether the restaurant does/has something for birthday celebration. The person replied "I tried to call you to confirm the reservation but you never picked up". Sorry I was in a conference the whole day... Then the person told me the restaurant usually arranges a small cake with a candle, which was ok for us because this is what most of the restaurants in Singapore will do.When we received the bill, we saw that they actually charged us for the tiny piece of cake (SGD12!) on top of our two desserts. If we were told in advance that the small slice of cake for birthday was chargeable, I won't complain but SGD12 discreetly on the bill for a tiny slice..
5
Excellent food and ambience. We were a little too greedy and went with 2 starters and 1 main course in addition to the 5 tapas tasting menu. It was a little too much for 3 pax but all's well.
3
I like the nice ambience of this restaurant... very comfortable.
Food is ok and so is service.
Can come and try when you are around here.
4
We never get disappointed to be there. This is why we came back there many times.
Every time, we tried something new, but always it is amazing.
5
3rd visit here. Better each time. We always go fo a seat at the bar. This time shared a 6 tapas set. Every dish was excellent. White wine by the glass perfectly chilled and on a Tuesday night Packed!! Dont forget to book!!
4
Excellent tapas and above average service. A little expensive especially if you order alcohol. I'm comparing it vs. Shanghai with the same type of restaurant. Paid 1.5x more.
5
My first time at Binomio although my husband has been a few times. Delicious tapas and excellent service - even for a very busy Saturday night. Will definitely be back!
4
To be honest I'm not exactly a fan of Spanish cuisine but I was very much impressed by the food at Binomio. The mushroom croquettes, octopus, scallops were delicious but the standout was clearly the swizz chard. I would have given 5 stars but for the steak which was a bit of a let down although to be fair I don't think that steak is a Spanish specialty.
5
Caught up with 2 friends over the set lunch at Bionomio and we all loved the food! Great choice of starters, main courses and dessert. We loved the mushrooms with soft egg, the crispy brussel sprouts that accompanied the perfectly-cooked barramundi and veal meat balls, and dessert of whisky cake. Will be back for sure!
4
Went here iwth a group of 7 colleagues and clients. Without requesting we were given our own priovate room away from the main restaurant and the service was great. Served by 3-4 staff and didn't have to wait for anything and were not rushed to finish our meal. The food and wine was also good and overall the price was fairly reasonable for a group of 7
5
We went here in a group of 5 with 2 young children. We were pleased to learn that the meat is halal, although pork and alcohol are on the menu. I recommend you try the ribeye steak cooked to medium, it is incredible. This is some great authentic Spanish food for all the family. Amaia is a great waitress also
5
Authentic great tapas, quality of the food is awesome. Croquettes, garlic prawns, meatballs, octopus are excellent. Paella was sadly not as good as expected. Churros for dessert are the highlight and definite must-order!
5
Food was awesome , especially the mushroom croquette and it was served really quick. A nice place to dine and chill
5
Food was good and super close to authenticity. Staff were friendly and they had a good variety of Spanish wines. The attractive 1 for 1 corkage deal was the icing on the cake which made me return more than once.
4
The service was great, staff were friendly.
Ambiance was nice and cosy.
Food was great but a little bit pricey. The binomio croquette is very nice!
5
This place is brilliant, we dined at the bar tapas and the quality of the food was unbelievable, so so good cannot wait to go back. Can't recommend highly enough!
5
we had the 3 course set lunch for $35++. The baby squid and Tuna Tatare were excellent starters with lots of greens and a rather large serving. For the mains, we both had the Barramundi. This had a nice crispy skin and the meat was cooked to perfection. For desserts, we had the sorbet and whisky cake. The sorbet was a tad sour but this was neutralised by the nuts that cane with it. The whisky cake was quite strong of whisky.
5
Have been here 4 -5 times in the last the last three years. Amazing authentic spanish food, particularly when you choose from the tapas counter menu. This means you will be seated on high stools at the counter and choose either 6 or 8 tapas. 6 will be sufficient for two persons with reasonable appetites.This place has never failed me. Forget celebrity spanish restaurants in Singapore. After Binomio, I won't bother trying other spanish restaurants.The service is also fantastic. My boss has a shell fish allergy and they were able to confirm which tapas she could have. We ordered 8 and my boss had a lovely time
4
I was there to celebrate my sister's birthday and we ordered the 5 tasting tapas to share and was awed by the quality of the food which was very good. We ordered the octopus, the crayfish, beef short ribs, bone marrow with beef tartar and tiger prawns. All of the dishes were great and the waiter was always there to help you for your wine selection along with the food you have ordered. Overall a great experience and I am sure I will be back again to try the the tapas too
4
Binomio located on Craig Road Tanjong Pagar, Duxton is definitely a heavyweight favourite. Brilliant food and great wine! The food, both tapas and full-on dining mains, is refined, elegant, and top-notch. Chef Jose Alonso as a distinct mastery to the way the ingredients are cooked, and the flavours enticed into full bloom, also whips up one of Singapore's most authentic servings of paella ,and that is why Binomio’s dramatic rise to stardom in the local dining scene. Last but not the least good things to say on ambience and food, but the Reliability in service can be improved. Anyway if you’re looking to experience the vibrantly bustling atmosphere of a tapas bar, or the serene refinement of a fine-dining restaurant, you'll do well at Binomio. For me this is one of the best Spanish food I have had in Singapore. Definitely recommend a visit and myself I will positively return
4
Had an excellent dinner here last weekend. The food was excellent, great wine list, table service was smooth and attentive. The only slight hiccup was the reception when there was no host to greet us for several minutes. There was a lot of confusion between people milling about at the tapas area, hence not waiting for a table, walk-ins enquiring on table availability, and people with reservations. Felt a bit like the drinks queue in a club. This could be improved
5
Must try their paella and various tapas. Good wine collection. Those not familiar with Spain's wine regions should read up a bit first. Appreciate the service staff who are attentive. Hard to Chope seats at this restaurant. Reserve early.
5
Delicious evening, expertly guided by the waitress on choice of tapas and great wines. Given a nice table in the corner - good for those of us hard of hearing. Everthing's for sharing - that's half the fun!
5
The Spanish tapas sharing is very filling and great for groups to share! Ambience is really fun and the service crew are super good too!
5
We usually go for the Sangria and the 5 Tapas Tasting Menu at the Tapas Counter! The Pimientos del Padron (Padron peppers), Zapatilla (Jamon and fresh tomato on toast), and Gambas al ajillo (Shrimps sautéed in olive oil) are just amazingly tasty!!! Our faves!!!!
4
There were six of us. We had tapas and wine. Food was very good as was service. Bill came to over $500.
Not sure if it is good value for money.
5
Been many times now to sample the good food here.Service was attentive and professional and the food delicious.Octopus and tapas is amazing.Black paella also very good.
5
The whiskey cake and tapas brings me back to Barcelona. Especially their creativity on their take on the tapas selection offered.
5
After our second try, we were finally able to reserve and enjoy our best Spanish food in awhile. The place was quite busy on Mother Day's eve. We arrived early (7 pm) and it was already more than half full. Food and service were excellent! The servers were attentive and in particular Anna took care of us very well!!! Food was just in time. Loved the Squid ink paella and the tapas - chorizo/cheese and octopus. Sangria fruit and cinnamon ice cream was superb. I love the fruits soaked in wine and my Wife loves anything cinnamon.We will be back
4
Great food - a couple of dishes were absolutely outstanding, the rest very good indeed. We booked a table for 4 at 8pm on a Sat night. Called ahead to say we'll be more likely 8.30. Arrived 8.40ish. Clearly they had rearranged in the meantime so we had to wait at the bar for 30mins. Received a complimentary bottle of cava, which was a nice touch. Were then put in the private dining room (pluses and minuses, would have preferred to be in the buzz).All in all nice set up and great food/wine. Try it. Will head back with some friends or just the wife to see if they get everything bang on next time
5
We went there on a Saturday and it's advisable to reserve a table in advance.Although fully booked service was excellent and very friendly. Top! Food was delicious and best Spanish food so far in Singapore. It's not cheap for Singapore standards but its fairly priced in my opinion with all the quality food they serve. Only minus point is that it can get quite noisy if you have a bigger group sitting next to you.
5
Lunch time is quiet. Right sized Spanish food allows for enjoying excellent food (try out seafood options such as crab, prawns and mussels) interspersed with business discussions.
5
loved the paella and other dishes as well, though the marrow was a little too raw for me. service was friendly, and liked the ambience.
5
The food was really great, sangria was the best I've had so far. Will definitely be my regular go to restaurant
4
Love their Paella & the spoil with choices of their Tapas. of course not forgetting their excellent appetizers & desserts.
5
Super friendly staff, impeccable service and the food always hit the right spots. Hands down my fave Spanish place.
5
Excelent food, excelent wine.
I am portuguese and I went there to test our Spanish neighbors as we have some similar dishes and I really enjoyed it. Chose the place for a date and will repeat one day.
5
I spent one week in Singapore. First I visited Binomio with my Portuguese and Spanish friends. It was totally crowded which is a good sign when you choose a restaurant. Authentic Latin feeling with delicious food and wine, so I decided to go back next day alone.I started with Pimientos de Padron with a glass of red wine form the cellar Cal Pla. Then I had a Wagyu beef shank. It was so tender, tasteful and yummy that I was absolutely fascinated with it. Two days later I took my friends to Biomino and tried a large variety of foods and wines. Everything was excellent! I am really happy to share my extraordinary culinary experience and definitely will go back next time
5
We had a family huddle at Binomio.. Highly recommended by a Japanese friend. What a super surprise! Every dish spoke to us in its presentation, texture on the palate and after taste! Speechless. The bone marrow and pork belly Tapas was a hit! I loved the squid ink paella..And the wines were reasonably priced and huge selection.. leave it to the sommelier.. he is super.. all round friendly and efficient staff.. will be back..!
4
Great atmosphere when you arrive, food was excellent and the staff were fantastic. The only thing that spoiled the overall experience a little was a very loud gentleman who'd enjoyed a little too much red wine at an adjacent table. Fortunately he left soon after we arrived and all was good. Definitely be back!! great value for money.
4
We were a group of 4 pax and were seated in the fine dining area. The environment was comfortable and it wasn't too noisy to have a good conversation. We initially ordered 5 tapas from the tasting menu and the owner was nice to let us add on 2 more tapas subsequently when we realised that we didn't have enough food! We also ordered the seafood paella (meant for 2 pax) which was superb! Overall the food was delicious but the bill came up to ~$350 which we thought was a little too expensive.
5
The staff were so attentive to us and our needs.. the food was delicious, and the environment is perfect for a special date. :)
5
Had the fixed menu and loved each course. Drank Spanish wine with the meal and tried new things and they were delicious. It has a great wait staff who are very friendly and helpful. A unique and fabulous experience.
4
Overall a good experience. Service was above expectations. Food 🥘 was surprisingly delicious. Will revisit soon enough.
5
My goto restaurant for authentic Spanish, with great food, wine, service and ambience.
Romantic for couples, as well as great fun for just friends hanging out.
4
Their staffs are friendly and the food was excellent. One of the best spanish food I had so far. Food was slightly pricey and the portion of food was tiny. U will have to order more if u are coming in big group.
4
My colleagues and I had good fun there, twice, so far. Having lived in Spain for many years, I would say that all is quite authentic except the price, but who's there to blame for this? The croquetas are a lot nicer than the typical ones in Spain---I actually quite disliked them back then so I stopped sampling after a short while thereby there might be some bias in it. I might not recommend the paella or the cochinillo though
5
For every time I've come here I've never been let down, especially for a vegetarian! Both their Tapas & restaurant menu options are outstanding with so many Flavours. The staff are fantastic and I will be sure to continue my monthly visits to this great restaurant

My husband made a reservation at this place as per good previous reviews .Well I know Singapore is an expensive city but I felt so disappointed with the choice, I think this place is over rated.For Valentine's day was not too busy at all.The candles on the tables were not light up.Our waiter didn't know much about the menu. I asked a couple of questions and his answers were vague.Our glasses of water were empty half of time, I keep asking to refill the water.We choose to go for 5 tapas for about $139, well the best of out the 5 tapas plates were the shrimps not excellent a bit oily, but taste was good, the rest were just OK, something that you can find in any standard food restaurant for cheaper price, not for a 4 or 5* restaurant like Binomio "is".The food was served too fast, they should be asking or measure the timings between plate.Portion for tapas were actually big.The sparkling rose we choose was good for about $60 not too bad in price.Dessert was very standard, the almond tart nothing especial.Also the dessert vine we had were good as well and the glasses were very full.The room they put us was very cold (take a shall with you just in case).I don't recommend this place if you are looking for fine dinning
5
Have been back twice in 2017 to Binomio and both times came away very impressed, with the food, the service and even the reasonably prices (by Singapore standards) wine list. I have visited Binomio on several occasions previously but not visited for a year or so. It seems to have improved and has really hit its straps. The menu is varied and most of the dishes are delicious - the anchovies were my standout. The service has really improved and the timing of the dishes reaching the table (one at a time with no waiting) was very impressive. Some lovely wines including a range of sherries. One of the best Spanish restaurants in Singapore (and there are an increasing number)
5
Famed for its suckling pig, we had a quarter to satisfy our craving...well...and within limits of our simple diet. Haha.The squid noodles exquisite and slurpy to say in the most layman terms. Ambience energetic and Mediterranean air rings familiar. Amazing service with nice recommendations of good wine.This is a place to come for good Spanish food. Don't miss it
4
Was here the first time tonight for dinner.
Lovely tapas- peppers, tartare, olives and prawn..
simple tasteful starters...👍
The team was friendly and attentive too.
Thank you
5
Great place to catch up with friends over tapas & drinks. I've been here a few times and the service is always impeccable. The chef and bartender never fail to make us feel at home with their friendliness. Reservation is a must to avoid disappointment.
5
The food is great, and the wine is reasonably good. The service is impeccable but the the place is always crowded so advanced booking is needed.
4
No 1 spanish restaurant in Singapore. Great food. Sophisticated tasting.
Good for couples, friends and businesses. Both lunch and dinner nice.
5
Just visited this establishment last evening for a team dinner. We had a few tapas which was enjoyable. The mushroom croquettes were wonderful, like mushroom soup in a crispy croquette. The ham and cheese flavour was good as well.I like the rosemary cheese served as appetizer as well.The sliced cuttlefish with onion dish was great! It has an Asian flavour akin to guo tiao and without the guilt of carbs. :)Also enjoyed the shrimps with garlic bread the flavour was good.We tried 3 types of paella and my favourite is the squid ink. The vegetable one not so much.The whisky cake was absolutely delicious with a lovely cream and sponge base. Love the texture, which is different from the frothy cream cakes by the Japanese (which I also enjoy).Overall a delightful experience
4
Went for set lunch which is a more reasonable price. Ala carte price is on the high side. The crab dish is very nice. Pork & a mushroom dish are salty on its on. The salmon apetitizer is normal. Did not have a chance to try paella as minimum order is for 2pax
4
We went for the set lunch, with starters priced at $13++, mains at $17++ and dessert $5++. The dishes were all executed beautifully - even the humble brussels sprouts were roasted to perfection. I'd highly recommend the 'Organic mushrooms served with slow cooked egg' from the starters, and 'Grilled Iberian Pork Pluma' from the mains. I loved the Catalan style toasted cream custard, not at all cloyingly rich and with a lovely tinge of cinnamon
5
Well after traveling fir almost three weeks we were at the point of not enjoying food at all ... that is until we had tapas at this place ... great food really well done great service and an awesome atmosphere.. thank you a great finish to 2016

Exelent food, very nice atmosphere, romantic, elegant, anything perfect but of course it is not a restaurant for everyone because it is a little bit expencive, but the quality is really good and the staff is perfect, the delay of the food is short so everything perfect apart the prices that are a little bit high
5
We brought some business associate to this restaurant and they arrange a private area for us. We have many dishes, we enjoyed the 36 months cured Spanish ham and the cheese platter, the croquettes is so good that is soft inside and crispy outside. We have 2 types of Paella and the squid ink Paella is my top choice. For dessert I love the Creme Catalana.
4
Nice simple ambience restaurant with experience knowledgeable proactive team. Friendly young Chef. We enjoyed our set lunch. Great taste. Wonderful whisky cakes for deserts. Will definitely be back there again.
5
Food is surprising in its deliciousness. Try many things, explore - you won't be disappointed. Octopus is amazing, croquetas too. Arroz nigro paella also amazing.
5
best spanish restaurant in Singapore, staff and
food are
always
top notch!! I never want to leave ;)
5
One of our favorite places in Singapore. We book at the tapas bar to be able to enjoy a lively ambiance and see the chef cook. Binomio is probably the best "true Spanish" restaurant in Singapore. Great tapas (not on creative side but definitely tasty) and pricing is reasonable. Service is always very good.
4
Went with friends and enjoyed a wonderful lunch. The set lunch was well put together although for those of with a large appetite, it was a touch on the light side. The iberico and barramundi main dishes were done to the right level of cooking. We all agreed we would be back, perhaps for dinner and savor their fine collection of Spanish wines.
5
I love the food in this place, with unique flavours. The ambience is nice and the service is very attentive. If it was not for the price, I would probably go here more often I haven't tried the selection of wines yet because I have been here for lunch both times, but it looks impressive.Overall, great choice for good food and a relaxed tim
4
The ambience and service at Binomio was very good. Staff were extremely polite and cheerful, making the dining experience a very pleasant one. The food was good, though I felt that the veal was nicer on a previous visit. The starters, desserts and sangria were very good! Very good value for money, especially the set lunch! I liked the idea of flexibility in the number of courses you could order in the set lunch
4
The atmosphere is good and encourages relaxed conversations over a glass or two of wine. We went there with friends and found the service good, but overly attentive to the point of being intrusive at times.They are keen to remove plates and cutlery, but need to wait until you have actually finished chewing. The food is good and designed to share. Well worth a visit

I'm very disappointed to learn that the restaurant said I did not make any booking. In the end, my bf and I had to sit at the bar area. Is this Chope's problem or the restaurant's problem? I had made numerous reservations via Chope and this is the first time I had this issue. The service was average. But Marc, the chef is awesome. I don't have to crack my head to know what to order. He did it for us, we just had to tell him what we don't eat. It was considered a bit pricey, considering I had a non-aircon and uncomfortable bar seat for the whole evening
5
Friends of ours took us to Binomio as mentioned that it is the best Spanish is Singapore and who are we do argue as they are Spanish themselves. We sat at the casual dining area by the window which is perfect for people watching and hanging out with a glass wine in hand. We ordered lots of variety of tapas which kept coming and frankly was stunning from frittata, potato bravas, octopus, pork belly - my fav has to be the squid ink paella... This is a definitely a place where you and large group of friends should go and enjoy, simply stunning Spanish cuisine! TIP: order bottles of wine it's very reasonable and if possible ask for the Magnum which goes a long way for the price.
5
Highly recommend this restaurant. Good food, wine selections and nice services gave us the wonderful evening !
5
We actually were booked into another restaurant but changed our mind when we saw the buzzing atmosphere in the restaurant. The food was great, the martini was perfect and the chef was Spanish. What more could you ask for. Great Saturday night out!!!
4
I have always been wary about Spanish tapas as they tended to be on the saltier side, but Binomio provides a pleasant and wonderful experience to the pallet! Not to mention their interesting tapas combinations, definitely well worth a try!
5
This is one of my new favorites in Singapore. The selection of spanish wines, the mix of food and the chance to talk to the chef was excellent. Our entire party of 6 had a great dinner in a private room.
4
This is my second time dining at Binomio. Food is fresh, wine tasty. The aircon can be colder. Overall great experience
5
The food was great and delicious! I would like to commend Mai Pelante and Marc Canalis for an excellent service! two thumbs up!
4
Been here a couple of times and Binomio proves to be good and reliable, albeit not cheap. The braised veal cheek was a success. Also good selection of Spanish wines.
5
A simply stunning dining experience all around.A well warranted carte du jour as well as a generous tapas and bulky beverage list is well received on all accounts!The flavour and presentation of our dishes was immaculate and impeccable! First class and assuredly a must for all!
5
Have been here twice already, and I am supremely satisfied with both visits. There's another Spanish place in town called Cocina del Mar, but Binomio is much better. The food is prepared exquisitely and absolutely delicious. The service is amazing. However, it's quite pricey! Spent $90 per person when I visited
3
Here's whats good: It's in the bustling duxton hill, the crowd is slightly more refined yet the place is casual, their wine selection is great. The food however left us wanting. We had the seafood paella which was o-k. I've had much better jammed with flavour ones at My Little Spanish Place in Bukit Timah. From the tapas menu we tried the prawn which came chopped up in oil - it lacked flavour and texture. We also tried the Eggplant with eel which was slightly bland. The cheese and olive entree was great but doesn't justify the high menu prices overall. Its got nice ambience - better to go for a drink with friends but go elsewhere for food
5
Lovely touch receiving a hand-written birthday message on the table as we arrived. Fabulous staff....highly personable and exceptionally competent.
5
Very warm and friendly service and some of the best Spanish food in town. End off the meal with a delicious glass of sherry.
5
While the ambience , decor, impeccable service were all on point, what stuck with us most was their specially curated Rioja blend- must not miss when you're here! We even took away a bottle for home.
5
Always excellent , good value , great staf
, great service .
Ingredients are fresh and food is very tasty.
Large wine list with good spanish wines.
4
Slightly overworked short order chef...but superb tapas.... especially the pork belly.
Nice atmosphere. Very neat layout. Friendly service.
Sit down service and menu inside is iffy though. Not as special as one would expect. But a good crowd.
Worth a visit
5
Delicious food and friendly Stuff makes Binomio a lovely Spanish experience right in the centre of the city. Perfect to go with friends before clubbing. We got a happy and elegant drunk thanks to the delicious good quality and affordable Spanish Cava (49sgd per bottle) we had tapas and main course...must try the cochinillo tartaleta and the arroz caldoso de perdiz. Super delicious. We staid in the private dinner room, perfect to go with friends. We go to repeat soon. By the way I am a foodie spaniard so I think that It is a Really good Spanish restaurant far from topics. Really surprised
5
We've been to this place over and over again and it never failed. Very good tapas, nice ambience, helpful people, good wines, all you need for a great night out. A place we will go back to again and again in the future. Really good place with consistent quality.
3
My friends and I had heard good things about Binomio, so we were naturally looking forward to a meal there. The food was pleasant, but not fantastic. What left us most dissatisfied was the service. The wait staff were not particularly attentive â€“ but we understand it was a Saturday evening. What was inexplicable, however, was that whenever one of us called for a waiter to top up our water, only the glass of the person who made the signal was filled, and the rest of the glasses on the table were left half-empty. This happened more than once, till we decided to place all our glasses at the same spot, to make it easier for all of them to be filled. Bafflingly, the waiter proceeded to top up just ONE of the glasses with water, and we had to explicitly instruct him to do the same for the rest. I don't think I'll be back
3
To start with a positive note, the service was overall excellent, very caring and efficient. The dishes were acceptable but the black ink paella was disappointing, rice was burnt, almost no seafood but some dust of squid. Sangria was not tasty and quite expensive to eventually get an improved orange juice. Maybe we were unlucky that evening.
4
Arrived pretty early and we were probably the first customers there. Staff were friendly and even offered me a cushion for my back seeing that i was pregnant. Food were all really delicious and the timing of serving the food was perfect. As soon as we finished one course, the next came right after. Unfortunately there was a big piece of clam shell in the paella that almost cost me a tooth!
2
Second time we visited this Spanish restaurant. This, after friends recommendation, we had dinner at the bar. Food was nothing wow. Lacking flair. Tapas menu limited. Being a big fan of Spanish food, we will give this restaurant a miss in the future
3
Can improve in the variety and quantity. Service is good. However there is rush to end the lunch session.
5
convenient location. very nice ambience with good food and service. professional staff. recommended for all occasions. good selection of wines.
4
We had an excellent time. Food was excellent...interesting n great balance for the palate! The desserts however can be improved. Portions not value for money
5
Enjoyed every minute of its food was good, portions were great, and the atmosphere was amazing. Highly recommend for tapas
5
Nice environment, good service and beautiful food. It's a shame that we have not tried the Segovia suckling pig. We love the veal cheek with mushroom and squid ink paella.
Highly recommended for celebration and romantic date.
3
Went for a family outing today. Food was good quality and well presented but portions are quite small, specially considering the generous prices. I was specially surprised with the paella. For the prices they charge the quantity of product was ridiculous. Having lived in Spain for many years, I can confirm that price / quality / quantity is out of tune..
5
I had dinner at the more casual tapas bar high chair area (another option was the dinner table area). Food was very good, particularly the mushroom croquettes, eggplant chips, thinly sliced cuttlefish and the pimentos! Service was good as well. I would not hesitate to return for another satisfying meal.
5
What a joy to find authentic taste of Europe in the heart of Singapore. We had tapas in the bar area, so that is what I am reviewing, but wow! It's a must try experience. We were four friends sharing at the end 14 tapas dishes - all superb, particular compliments for peppers padron, mushroom croquetas, and braised pork cheek. Even gambas tasted of Spain, and not local shrimps. Lovely service, wine, coffee, all together lovely evening. Reservation is a must! This is busy place, and I understand why. Definitely a place to visit when in SG
5
The food is excellent @ Binomio. The quality is there! We shared plate of Jamon Pata Negra, tuna tartar, cheese plate, cuttlefish and a squid ink paella. Everything was YUMMY. We had a small dessert as we were full. The wine and food menu is very complete. One small comment though : I would like more options for the dessert. The service is perfect. This is a "zero" mistake.Been there many times and there is always someone to serve you with a smile. My friends had an excellent impression of Binomio and we will, for sure, come again.
5
Am very very please that the service was immaculate and they are also kid-friendly thus my child and us were really happy. Would love to see more variety in their tapas range and also vegetables-driven dishes. Overall totally amazing.
5
Brought another friend who loves tapas to Binomio, she too agrees the food is good, especially the Sangria, as good as the ones she tried while in Spain
3
We had a nice lunch at Binomio, though we weren't amazed. The set lunch menu has some great options and the service was really attentive.
4
My friends came and celebrated three birthday dinners. We given a private room and had excellent service. Had set meal of tapas, tartars, beef and paella (both squid ink and seafood) and dessert. Good selection wine as well
4
Evening meal with colleagues. A few different tapas variants for sharing and main course. We were all pleased with the quality of food (I have lived 4 years in Barcelona). I would go back for food, service and atmosphere. Only negative is that I smelled some degree of frying smells at entrance
3
Good place for a fun night out with friends.Plenty of choice for some original and traditional tapas with a decent choice of mains.The wine list was broad enough and reasonably priced.The service was timely and effaced, never disrupting the table ebullient discussion (thanks to good Spanish wine)
5
Came here a few times for lunch through a friend's recommendation.The set lunches here are so good and value for money.The portion if the food is really generous. I am already full after the starter!I love the mushroom croquette and omelette here. Definitely a crowd pleaser! The mains like the grilled squids and seafood paella are very delicious too. Definitely worth coming here for the good food and great service
5
I celebrated my birthday here with my friends and totally forgot about time :-) as everything was enjoyable. Good selection of tapas on dining menu, mostly with seafood. Fresh cheese terrine with honey olive oil is a must-try. We shared 2 paella among 5 girls and the one with chorizo is my favorite. We also asked for Padron peppers from the bar menu (twice). Can't miss to mention that the service is impeccable. They are friendly, attentive and accommodate our special request very well. Great dining experience and will come back again
4
The food here is very good but its not cheap. We especially enjoyed the grilled pork with spinach and mushrooms, the pan fried cuttlefish, tiger prawns confit and the mushroom croquettes. Wine is quite decent also. Service was very good also this time around. However, the first time I visited this place, the service was really terrible though
5
This place is full all the time!! My friend manage to snag a table on a TUESDAY and the place was full! Every dish on the menu was fantastic! great service and vibe. celebrated my birthday there earlier this month and I had a hand written note from the staff! And the slice of birthday cake was to die for, even though I was so so full from everything
4
Brillant food, service and lively atmosphere. Perfect little place for old friends to catch up or intimate dinner with your partner,
5
They have upped their service standards and provided complimentary birthday cake. The food still awesome tasting and they've even changed their menus. Definitely will go back there again.
5
We had dinner at the tapas bar as we were told this is the only way to hve both tapas as well as the restaurant menu. Tapas,Paellas & desserts were great! Luv the sangrias too ( both red & white) cos its strong enough compared to all other Spanish restaurants that I hve ever visited. Highly recommended! The only thing to note is the tapas bar may not be appropriate for big group gatherings as there are no big tables
5
The Authentic Spanish cuisine that this restaurant have to offer is just amazing, it's foremost one of the best Spanish restaurant with a Tappas concept which what you see in Spain. Paella.. Jamon.. Croquettes.. You name it, it's full of flavours. Earthy and fresh with exclusive selection of wines. It's a place to be at.
5
I had the Gambas al ajillo (Tiger prawns), Bacalao guisado (Atlantic cod fish stew), Cochifrito (Suckling pig) and Fideua Negra (Squid ink noodle paella), wrapped up with churros. together with my wife to celebrate our anniversary. We were seated in the back room and shared a bottle of white Sangria between the two of us.Apart from the fish stew being a tad salty, the food was otherwise pretty damn good. The Tiger prawns was superb and the little broth that was on the plate was happily wiped clean with some warm crusty bread that was put on the table by the kind waiter that saw us trying to scrape out the bottom with a spoon. The plate with the suckling pig with truffle potato puree and roasted pealed garlic cloves was cleared up.Finally the Fideua... It was excellent and my wife, normally not a big eater, cleaned out the pan literally. The only small complaint that we had about the dish was that it would have been nice to have some more calamari pieces or baby shrimp scattered. Other that that, it was perfect. The upside about this was that we could order a few tapas and a paella plus desert between the two of us because they had half sized paellas. The meal size was just about right although we were both very full after dinner.Overall, excellent food and service with the friendly staff. I've just booked again for dinner and hope to get to try the tapas bar instead one day
5
Being Spaniard myself and traveling extensively, I very sheldom go to Spanish restaurants outside of Spain, since I do prefer eating local food. This time I was taken to Binomio by some friends, as an exception, with the promise that I would love it. And that is an understatement. I found it fantastic. Food has gotten a great balance between tradiional cuisine and new recipes. I loved every single dish. Service is extremely professi0nal as well as friendly. I will repeat definitely. Great job
5
The entire experience at Binomio was lovely. From the minute we arrived, we were well received and whisked off to our table tucked away from the main dining hall which is perfect. Our request was well met. Their selection of wines and cava is plenty. Price range is good from affordable to the best. Service was excellent. They are attentive and warm where necessary. A good tapas menu. Portioning was generous and I mean hearty. Could be almost a meal for petite eater. Between two of us, we had 8 orders. We repeated one of our orders. That's a clear indicative how much we enjoyed our dinner.To start with we had a palate of Serrano, Lomo and Chorizo and they are divine. Then Mushroom Croquette. Crust is light and fillings are delicious. Liver Pate on cracker beautiful, Char Grilled Pork (meat from the neck) wonderfully executed, Octopus Feira Style absolutely heaven (all time favourite of the evening and twice we ordered). Octopus is juicy, tender and it melts into your mouth. Catalan brûlée and chocolate dessert wrapped up our dinner interestingly. Yes, I agree palate is very Individual. All I can say is before Binomio, Barcelona is so remote. Now, I am back in Barcelona again. That's it's a gratifying feeling.
4
This was my second visit in a month and both times the food and service was exceptional. I like the fact that they have a range of reasonably priced wines on the menu and that they have a good range of vegetarian tapas. One of my visits was with vegetarians and for the first time in my 40-odd years I had a fully vegetarian Spanish meal!!
5
This restaurant serves excellent tapas dishes. The paella is delicious as well. You can ask for a half portion even though the menu item is for two people. There is a good range of wines. Service is fast, friendly and unobtrusive. For dessert, try their whiskey cake. You won't regret
5
We went to this restaurant after reading a blogger's review.Restaurant setting was comfortable, fine dining type but not pretentious. We ordered their 3-course set lunch. Food was of high quality; we esp liked this main - spinach wrapped w pasta served with prawns, the prawn were so fresh & sweet! Service was good too. We also see chef go around tables, having a good time with patrons.Overall, it was a great dining experience... 1 of the best we had in a long time. Would like to visit again
5
Great food, wine and service! They offer a good range of wines with relatively reasonable price! Will come back again soon for sure!!
4
Went with a group of friends and we ordered 5 tapas and 2 main paella. It was delicious food and excellent services but it was a bit pricy.
4
Great Spanish restaurant! We enjoyed all the tapas that we had.
We were lucky to sit in a private room, otherwise the restaurant is very noisy.
4
Very enjoyable evening with business colleague. The diversity of food was good and well balanced with recommended wines. Lively atmosphere for a weekday crowd.
4
I had reserved at 6.30pm for dinner with friends on a Saturday. We arrived early and was seated immediately.
Service was very good and prompt. The environment is not noisy and rowdy as it was still early. We had a very peaceful dinner.
5
We dined at Binomio with friends for dinner. We decided on the tasting menu and were not disappointed. Every course was well presented and absolutely delicious. Service was discreet and attentive. Would highly recommend it, and would definitely dine here again!
4
My second time here and still I find the tapas to be as good as I remembered them. They got great Spanish reds as well to complement the dishes. It is always a treat to be visiting Singapore and having at least one meal at Binomio!
4
Go for the degustation menu and you get to try all the signature dishes. It is worth the price. The squid ink paella is really excellent. The churros dessert is another winner for me. Overall, we enjoyed our dinner there but the men, despite being small eaters, felt the portion was a little lacking. The restaurant gets noisy when the crowd fills in. I will return for the food
5
We had a wonderful relaxing lunch. Service was excellent from the waitresses to the manager. Attentive without being intrusive. We had the set lunch which at S$35++was great value. All the courses were very well prepared and taste great. Even the chef took time to say hello and enquire about our lunch. We will definitely return.
5
I have been to Binomio many times. I love the food and the atmosphere as it feels like you could be in Spain. The food is as good as it would be in good restaurants and bars in Northern Spain. You could be in any tapas bar in San SebastiÃ¡n and you would have the same experience. I love the tapas but the selection of paelllas and their black rice are also amazing, if you go with friends I recommend the bar area where you can see the chef cooking the tapas. Highly recommend it as the prices and the portions are very reasonable. Their house wines are good quality and the price is amazing for what you get. I definitely find Binomio like home and I always go when I am felling nostalgic.
5
Had the croquetas, pork/beef stew and seafood stew. The seafood stew was the highlight, with savory, warm flavors.
5
Easy on the pocket, $35++ for a 3 course lunch set. Comfortable and private ambience, great for meetings with clients!
3
I went recently for a business dinner. The food was decent but not exceptional, however it was high end even by Singapore standards. I thought it was ok but forgettable and not a place I would rush back to.
5
Food and service was excellent. Just too bad that we were seated beside a group of very rowdy men who were eventually joined by female companions. This led to them having to increase the seating capacity of their table and their chair were constantly 'banging' against ours. But I supposed it wasn't appropriate for the service crew to remind them of their volume nor their inappropriate disturbance to other diners. But other than this unfortunate mishap, all was good. Ã
4
This would have been 5/5 has we not had a mix up at the bar when having pre dinner drinks - problem was raised to the management at the time and sorted. The Food is excellent and although it's not cheap it represents good value - more special occasion than every day and overall, very enjoyabl
5
I very rarely do reviews for restaurants. They either have to be appallingly bad or just incredibly good! Binomio falls into the latter category! So good that you are compelled to rave about the meal and service for a long long time.Firstly our server was Bang. A happy (very rare occurrence in Singapore!), outgoing personality who helped us choose the best dishes, made a few especially for us off the menu and also sent a few complimentary ones our way since we were loving the food so much!Very rarely do you feel like leaving a tip on the top of the service charge in Singapore - but Bang deserved it and perhaps more!The food oh the food! Everything we ordered was delicious with the right balance of flavors and so beautifully presented! The highlight of course was the manchego cheese and honey tapas which we ended up ordering a second one of!Drinks done to perfection, and nothing was too much work. I will definitely be going back to Binomio again.Just remember to reserve a table as it gets quite busy
4
We'd been meaning to go and finally was able to head over. Head a lot about it so expectations were slightly high, which can be a bad thing but; not in this case. We didn't have the degustation. Had the grilled bone marrow - that was good and had good texture too, not liquidy like some others I've had! Very rich so two people could have shared half a portion. Which is one of the good things, they can do half portions for some of the tapas for half the price! Had the pan fried crayfish - I really liked this one. It was cooked to perfection! JUST nicely cooked so it was super tender and not tough. The spider crab in basque country style was also delicious. Then we had the squid ink paella (sans clams) - it was excellent!. Yummy. Dessert was very good; a whiskey layered on top of a slice of cake. I didn't initially think I'd like it but it turned out to be really good. Definitely a place I'd go back to. Oh and because it was a birthday dinner, they actually wrote a nice little card to wish the birthday girl! Which was a nice touch.
5
Good food and recommendations. Had Churizo, mushroom deep fried thingy ( x2 because it was so good) and a nice prawn dish. We let them suggest so I can't remember exactly what the dishes were.They have a good selection of wines, focussed, logically on Spanish.As typical in Singapore, you are paying top dollar for eating at Binomio
5
This unassumming restaurant at Craig Street have you thinking back of your time in Barcelona when you can walk into any restaurant and sit by the bar to have tapas and a sangria and watch the whole go by. Even if you have not been to Spain, this can be the closest thing for you. The chef by the bar is friendly and explains your order as it comes. You see him prepare them with much dedication and care. Every dish is lovingly done and one can sense he takes pride with his consistency and time of delivery.The main restaurant is not as pretencious as ones in the area. The matre'd is Spanish, one of the wait staff is also from Spain. The menu is authentic and with prices comparable to a restaurant of this nature, it is definitely a must place to visit if you are in the mood for cuisin
5
A very memorable tapas experience at the restaurant bar. We celebrate our friends birthday dinner at Binomio. The bartender & chef gave special attention to their guest. They make us feel very welcome and chatted with us. There are few tapas that were very good - salmon tartare, ham croquettes, mushroom croquettes, iberico pork, chorizo on crispy bread and seafood paella are not to be missed items. Tapas is available if you are seated at the bar counter. We ordered 8 tapas & seafood paella, Portions very sufficient to share among 4 of us. Binomio arrange a birthday dessert for our birthday girl. It was nice dining experience. Will definitely recommend others to try out this Spanish place.
5
Good service, good food, great wine and reasonable price. The dishes were served with perfect timing. Although the restaurant was full, the service was perfect.
5
Not my first visit, wont be my last. The food, service & people are just fantastic. The wine selection is extensive & excellent.
5
Great food, esp the tapas, great service, very good ambience. Would definitely recommend to anyone!!
4
food was excellent.the set meal was worth the money..attentive staff..the ambience was fairly decent.will definitely come back!
3
We went there for lunch on weekday and it was a bit empty.
I was told that the ambient is usually far better at night.
Food/tapas is Ok but nothing to come crazy about.
5
Took my wife to Binomio for Valentine's Day and was pleasantly surprised to find that this place doesn't do the rip-off V-Day menus like all the other Western restaurant do (you know those: "here's some stuff we chucked together and it would normally cost you $80 per head but heck it, it's Valentine's so let's just make you pay $180 instead"). Anyway I digress ...You walk through a cool little bar and then into the main dining room which is gently lit and makes one feel relaxed. We ordered the $88++ tasting menu plus one sangria each (she had the white sangria and I had the red one). Each of the courses were amazing in their own way! Highlight for me was the squid ink paella and jamon iberico - really delicious!!!I would come again in a heartbeat and fully recommend this place. Oh and the service was attentive but not overbearing. Great job guys!!
5
We were actually intending to go to a different restaurant,but spotted this place,looking busy for 7pm. Busier than we thought!! Managed to snag 2 stalls at the end of the bar,and So glad we did. We chose several different Tapas and a cheese plate,accompanied by cold crisp white wine. Delicious. Great atmosphere,staff,surroundings. We shall be back!!
5
We tried the tapas menu and sat at the bar. It was by far my best Spanish restaurant experience in Singapore. Tapas chef, kitchen chef and manager are all from Spain. At the bar we got to talk to the tapas chef and also get his recommendations on what to order. I went with my husband and teenage son. We figured we would try the tapas first to check it out. Our tapas were excellent and very authentic. We will definitely go back and try the restaurant menu. The staff was very serviceable and professional
2
Came back here with huge expectation after having tried their charcuterie (iberico bellota) and some bar food which was nice.Tried the foie gras but it was full of veins and a bit blood, and bone marrow, which was just average. We did't have any memorable dinner despite this place was recommended often by some Spanish friends
5
We ate at the bar and it was great!We were served by chef Marc. all its recommendations was very good! The taste of the dishes transported me a few seconds to Spain.It was a culinary orgasm!The service was very attentive, I can't remember the name but we were served by the girl's dental braces.For sure I'll be back
3
Went to there with my wife. Food, drink and staff was very nice. It has nice ambience. I think it is good place to enjoy dinner with friends
5
All was really good. The squid Rush was voted the best .... If you are after tapas - this place is a must ...
5
FIrst time at Binomio, love the food and ambiance. Very friendly staff too, the calamari is so yummy! I have already booked the place for my birthday party!
5
recently visted....very friendly and decent wait staff and short order chef..... polite, decent and easy folks. Will definitely go again !
4
This is my 4th visit to Binomio. Service and food standard is maintained. That said, I felt the food pricing was on the higher end compared to the quality.
4
A typical Spanish tapas place with great food and drinks. Come for the paella, and experience a range of excellent wines.
4
Very good restaurant with an option of eating at the bar counter area, which is less formal. Warm service and a strong wine collection. Food is very good, mushroom croquettes are a favourite!Just a touch on the pricey side, which stops me giving it 5 starts - even taking into account it's in Singapore.
5
Chef Marc made us his favorite tapas. All were fantastic. Paired with a few nice glasses of wine, and we were in hog heaven. If there was a downside, it was that we should have purchased a bottle of wine instead of by the glass as the wine pours were a little conservative compared to just purchasing the bottle
5
Came to have dinner with the family as we have been missing good spanish food since visiting Barcelona. Read some good stuff particularly about certain dishes so we decided to give Binomio a shot....The restaurant was cosy and well suited for a more sophisticated dining scene. Lights were on the dimmer side and a low-medium buzz of conversation could be heard from the main dining area (the bar area perhaps a little louder). Our waiters and waitresses were prompt and courteous and started with recommending the already recommendable dishes mentioned online. He then also gave us advice on the wine to pair with our meal.First came the starter of Seleccion Ibericos - great to share between 3-4 people and just the right way to start the night with our drinks. The Lomo cut was the best tasting in our opinion and the cheese a good light pairing with the meat.Next came the tapas - the grilled cuttlefish and tiger prawns (the two best tapas of the night), and the pork belly and razor clams (not bad but not as good as the first two). All the tapas were really stand-out dishes that night though!We then tried the paella - the servers were nice enough to serve us a smaller portion of the two popular paellas; the classic and the squid ink, of which the classic might have been slightly better.The dessert was a delightful surprise as well! We tried the coconut ice cream with pineapple and the appel tatin cake (could not pick a favorite) both were a wonderful light and fresh ending to a lovely dinner.In order of best courses: tapas, dessert, starter, paellas.An absolutely lovely dinner where we enjoyed refined spanish food. Still have to say nothing beats the real deal fresh from the markets of Barcelona but it came damn damn well close enough all the way this side of the world

A must go to. The tapas was delicious. The dishes were interesting and very tasty. When not in Spain eat at Binomio. The wine list was good, mainly Spanish wines and a good selection. Not sure I liked having a half filled glass of cava, 3/4 would have been better for the price. Will definitely go back. Delicious.

Food and service are excellent and each dish is unique and yummilicious! We have been back many times and each time we are left "woahed"!
5
Amazing food. Yes it's pricey but worth every cent.
Mushroom Croquettes are so smooth they melt in your mouth.
Cray fish is delectable.
If only we could fit dessert in I'm sure it's Devine too.

Tapas is trendy in Singapore however usually small portions big price.
Please this place had authentic food and decent portion sizes.
Service was decent.

Here for dinner with friends and a baby. The food is super delicious and ambience is great! Love it! Definitely worth a visit!

Food was disappointing after reading all the hype about this restaurant. Contrary to what you may read online, seats at the tapas bar counter also require reservations and walk-in customers are apparently not welcome based on the frosty reception by service staff.
5
5th December 2015, visited Binomio again for dinner and this time with our friend who is a foodie and a very good cook himself.
Highly recommended and must order dishes:-
Squid Ink Paela
Fried Suckling Pig with broccoli
croquettas
36 months cured ham

As a Spaniard living in Singapore, and after visiting many others Spanish places in the city, I can say that this is the best Spanish restaurant here, together with the other same-owners tapas bar version called Tardeo, which is next door to the restaurant. Binomio is more like a classic restaurant to eat sitting down on tables, but you can also have some tapas at the counter, which has open windows to the street. The food is terrific. Here you can eat the best paella in Singapore, as well as many other yummy Spanish dishes. Having a look to the wine menu is a must. Whatever bottle you order to go with your food, for sure you will not regret. The selection is very balanced: you can find good and affordable options but also high profile wines. In case you are not used to Spanish wines, ask the staff. They are very friendly and professional, and are always happy to suggest the best option depending on the food you are going to order. Do not forget to have a look to the desserts but note this one: "churros" with chocolate
5
Dined here at the tapas counter. I have eaten at many Spanish tapas restaurants in London and Spain. The food here was very good, service was friendly and efficient, restaurant had good busy buzz. I thought pricing was really reasonable for Singapore. I would definitely return
5
They never disappoint you. Compare to other top spanish restaurants like ohla, catalunya in singapore, Binomio is the only decent and consistently good place that will never disappoint you. Their pata negra is amaaaaaaaaazing, they serve you real cortado and churros, and their selection of cava is really great. Good for candle light dinner or just drinks with tapas as well.
5
Absolutely fabulous food and ambiance. Its always packed that goes to show how popular it is. They have a private room thats tastefully decorated a very fun bar up front to grab a drink and people watch. definitely have the green pepers and chorizao starters. Actually have them all. Its finger licking good
5
Binomio is the only Spanish restaurant I keep returning to since they first open. The food is consistently delicious. I always overeat there! I tend to order way too many tapas. All the pork and octopus dishes are all amazing.
5
I have been coming regularly for over 3 years. Consistently excellent food and service. U can't go wrong on a night out here.
5
Lovely tapas, but nit as you know them. When you book at the bar like we did you get wonderful contact with the cook who can advice you on a prrfect mea. Very good wines as well!
5
We enjoyed the tapas a lot. Definitely one of the best I've had in Singapore.
Loved the Spanish Tortillas, it was very fluffly and moist. We thought the pace of serving was good, wasn't too rushed and it wasn't slow.
4
Made for a wonderful evening with friends. Willing to customise dishes to cater to veggies. We'll be back.
4
We really enjoyed our meal consisting of Spanish tapas and fine wine. We would definitely come again to sample more of the menu.
1
Food not bad, somewhat pricy, terrible service. After asking for our dish three times, finally our waiting time for a tapas is 50 mins. What a shame.
5
The restaurant is very popular and the service was still excellent,we had the set menu which was. Very tasty. There was a good ambiance without feeling too crowded and the whole meal flowed very well .We did make a reservation and I would advise others to do so to avoid disappointment....I would definitely recommend this restaurant to other
4
We tried the degustation menu which was reasonably priced. Dishes that are outstanding includes the Croquetas Binomio that is crispy on the outside with oozing goodness on every bite and the tender sweet pan fried crayfish. The pan fried strip of cuttlefish was also very well done with texture that is both noodle like yet chewy. Their squid ink paella was wonderful but will need to eat it worm. It gets fishy when it is cold.Overall, it was a great dining experience with wonderful tapas at a good price
5
I have been a fan of tapas for the past couple of years and have tried my fair share of tapas restaurants in town. But I have to say, the food at Binomio is absolutely superb!We were a party of 4, and started with the recommended mushroom croquette, followed by the tiger prawns, crayfish, pork belly and suckling pig tapas. The suckling pig tapas is worth a special mention. While not usually a fan of suckling pig, this one is simply out-of-this-world! The meat was juicy and perfectly seasoned. And the accompanying Brussel sprouts were charred to perfection! I couldn't stop thinking about it for the rest of the night!The meal was followed by the squid ink paella, which was rich but not at all oily, with the squid morsels cooked just right - superb execution.We ended the night with the whisky cake, fruit tart and apple tatin. Even though I am not usually a fan of non-chocolate desserts, all 3 desserts were absolutely delightful! The whisky cake was light with a generous dose of whisky glaze accompanied by crunchy roasted almond flakes, and the apple tatin was served with the most luscious creamy concoction. And finally, the fruit tart was filled with sweet and juicy berries, ending the superb dinner with just the right amount of sweet and tanginess.Service at the restaurant was flawless as well, swift and friendly. The staff was on hand to recommend the dishes but nice enough to let us know 3 desserts were enough to share instead of ordering one each.It may be a little bit pricey compared to some other tapas restaurants - about $70 per person without alcohol, but quality comes with a price and this is worth every cent! I simply can't wait to be back again
5
My friend and I were catching up, so we stayed there for more than three hours. No pressure from the waiters at all.
4
Food is good, though not typical Spanish (more fusion). Prices are steep for the quantity of the servings. We had 9 tapas, 1 starter to share, extra bread and aioli (not on the menu) for the 3 of us, but it was barely enough. We paid SGD 450 including a bottle of red wine but without coffee or dessert
5
I finally had dinner at Binomio where my Singaporean friend who is foodie and has a good palate mentioned this Spanish restaurant all the time when we had tapas in BKK. It's always packed and closed on Sundays (I m from Thailand but frequently fly to Singapore during weekends for foods ..so either Sat or Sun I can stay in Singapore..)I went there alone on Saturday night but wasn't lonely at all as Binomio's chef and team gave me a very warm welcome. Chef Houssein Hafian Rodriguez, today's chef operation, greeted me with his Tapas selection. He kindly serve me half portion from original size. First was Classic Spanish Omelette. So Spanish!!! It was an Egg Omelette filling with potatoes and onion..you may think it sounds too simple, right??!! BUT!!! It's flavorful!!! Second, coming mushroom and Binomio croquettes..with Allioli and MOJO sauce. For mushroom croquettes, the hot crispy and un-oily skin of croquette with a filling of mushroom with mayo was well-pronounced its taste. Binomio's croquette was composed of ham, chicken and boiled egg .. I love this bite so much because the balancing tastes of creamy and sweetness plus the crispy texture and chewy ham and chicken with a bit spicy with MOJO sauce WOW!!! The bite was totally perfect. !!!I have also tried squid ink noodle paella topped with cheese (Yummy!!) with additional grilled Carabinero. Yes!!! Paella base here was NOODLE not rice..that was truly made my day.. This was the first time I finished the whole paella by myself. The small andante black noodle was perfectly cooked. Cheese and baby squid were excellent paella noodle's flavor enhancers. Chef taught me the trick to be more enjoyable.. he gave me his premium olive oil with sprinkled sea salt and suggested me adding into my paella like a seasoning sauce.. WOW!!! I had no words to explain my awesome feeling. It was like a moment of happiness happened in every bite. You must try yourself !!! And That's the END of my trip in Singpapore .. this time!!! See you again next month :)

Dined here on the 10 Oct 2015. Ordered 2 Menu Degustacion $98 each as the 2 of us would like to try a variety of dishes and ordering a la carte would be too much food for us and we probably wouldn't be able to try as many dishes as we could. We also noticed that the a la carte comes in a double portion of the same set dish. Also ordered a bottle of Duval Leroy Brut. Food was very good, couldn't finished the last main course of veal, even though we hardly eat the bread that came with some of the earlier courses as we both are not so big eater.To dine here on a weekend, one should either make an early reservation of 6 to 6:30pm or a later at 9pm as I can see the restaurant was fully booked with at least 2 seating on that Sat evening.Because of the 2 seating, the service may seemed a little rushed to some people but the service staff were mostly very polite and friendly except the European looking waitress who didn't came across to us as welcoming. The assistant Manager, Sky, was very attentive and engaging. Would like to dine here again with a group of friends to try more of the other dishes.Menu Degustacion:--Jamon Iberico 36 months cured (Excellent)-Croquetas Binomio (Excellent)-Terina de Fois (Very Good)-Pan Fried strips of cuttlefish with onion and veal sauce(Very interesting. This dish looked exactly like the Chinese Koay Teow Noodle but its actually cuttlefish- Good Job!)(Very Good)-Char grilled pork belly and razor clams (The razor clams were very sweet and tender, wished there were more) (Excellent)-Pan Fried Cray Fish with "trinchat" potatoes-(Good)-Carabinero wet rice (Very Good except that one prawn which came with it we thought was not too fresh. So rating was given only to the rice alone)-Braised veal shank (very good)-Dessert - Whisky Tart (Excellent)They accept BYO but charged a corkage of S$45 or otherwise one for one

Tried Binomio sometime last year, and really liked it. Went on Monday with a friend, and food was really good as was the service. Went back this week with my husband and another couple for a 9pm dinner on a Friday. Our table wasn't ready, so we had to wait quite a bit. When it was ready, the hostess took her time seating us because she was busy chatting with another patron (along with another server, so he was being helped) - she apologized, but it was quite annoying given the already long delay. And then the service was quite manic, and inconsistent. We had to flag help numerous times, pour our own wine etc. To boot the kitchen closes at 10:30pm, and we were really rushed towards the end in terms of food ordering even though we were seated at least 20 minutes after our reservation time. We did get a few friendly queries about the food from the kitchen, and some complimentary grappa at the end, which was a nice gesture. Perhaps the restaurant is just understaffed -- I'd advise increasing staff to make the experience more enjoyable for patrons. Clearly a popular spot, so I think worth the investment. Food was good, as was the wine we selected
4
Binomio has a casual bar seating area and a more formal, fine dining area. I much prefer the casual section as i enjoy watching the chef cooking up a storm. You can also order items from the fine-dining area, no problem. The staff are friendly and attentive and always ready to recommend if you need help. The garlic prawns are to die for. You'd be tempted to ask for more bread to soak up the tasted garlic infused olive oil.While I agree with a previous reviewer that the standard has dropped since my first visit more than a year ago, Binomial remains a favourite of mine and my group of friends. The food is still delicious and the many spanish people who continue to drop by is testament to that. Like they say - want to find a good japanese restaurant? Go where the Japanese go. I think it applies to tapas and spanish people too.Prices are not cheap, but there are tapas places in Singapore which charge way more for poorer quality food. Wine by the bottle is also cheap by singapore pricing standards. And you get the good stuff. For food, i suggest you get the 6 or 8 dish tasting menu and share. A tip - if Binomial is too expensive for your pocket...go next door to El Toredo. They serve great, cheap Pintxos and booze. Opened by the same people that run Binomio. Same friendly, convivial atmosphere
5
Binomio serves one of the best Spanish food I have tasted. You can either sit at the tapas counter where you can order individual tapas or a set of 6 or 8 tapas course at very reasonable pricing. Or you can opt for the formal dining area and I opted for the degustation menu which is good value for the quality and range of food served. Great food and good beers
3
Was pretty excited to be back at Binomio but i feel the standard has dropped since the last time I dined here. There isn't any WOW factor after we had the meal and the paella was slightly on a salty side. The dessert wasn't great either. we weren't that impressed with neither churros nor the whisky cake that we had.   
5
The place was really nice and the servers are friendly too. We ordered parma ham for starter, squid ink paella with clam and calamari for main, white wine and dessert. The half portion of the starter is really good. We finished everything including the other round of bread. The white wine, can't remember the name but it was pretty good too.The squid ink paella is VERY RECOMMENDED, it was really good. Well done! I'm really happy with the food, portion, and service esp when you eat with a good company ;) To be honest, the price is not bad either. It's worth it!I'll definitely recommend the place to my friends, and will be back again
3
There as much hype around this restaurant so of course we were excited to visit and try their paella. Unfortunately it did not meet expectations and was ridiculously expensive. If you've been to Spain and have ideas about Spanish food then this is not the place for you. The service was good and so was the ambiance but the prices and quality killed it for me
5
My second visit to binomio. Excellent service, fantastic wine list and awesome food. One of the best restaurants in Singapore in my view
$s170 for 2 in the dining room plus wine.
5
Probably one of the best Spanish restaurants in Singapore. We had the binomio tasting platter and it was excellent. Each of the dishes was done very well. The wine selection is also excellent.
5
Birthday dining with my friends and the staff are not hesitant to offer their best recommendations. The ambience was light hearted and friendly. We had an awesome time spent.
5
I went to Singapore on holidays. My Spanish speaking friends there took me twice to this fantastic place for dinner. The chefs and manager are warm and friendly and clearly love their job. The food is outstanding. Highly recommended.
4
Great lunch menu with Paella served at very reasonable price. Typically, this Spanish restaurant makes a squid ink paella that commands a very good following. At lunch, it was a lighter, chicken version I recall and no squid ink. Creamy and just the right level of doneness
5
A great variety of fantastic Spanish specialty tapas recommended by the maitre d' did not disappoint us: Arroz Negro (squid with black rice in squid ink), cheese, churros, Tomato on toas (pan con tomate) mushroom croquets, wonderful grilled veg and padron peppers, (parrillada verduras), lamb rack tapa, octopus, cuttle fish noodles, cheese terrine, and a couple more, I cannot remember
1
The food is undoubtedly good, but the service is desperate. We've been many times before you needed to book for the counter and been greeted like old friends. Now they have the booking system and we're busy everyone, including the manager went out if their way to ignore us. I guess we will never return
3
Have now been to this place for lunch and dinner and I'll have to say that overall its just average. The service is great and the ambiance is nice. The food is just so-so for fine dining. We ordered the seafood and vegetarian paella for lunch and found it salty and bland. The tapas were OK, except the group didn't feel the prawns lived up to ones they have had at other spanish restaurants. Also, wasn't happy that I was charged full brice for the Pork Belly and clams, when they had no clams. Thought I would have been given a discount
4
This is a happening restaurant on a Saturday and for good reason...excellent Spanish fare. Good selection of Tapas to share for 2-4 people or select from a decent list of individual entres. Very busy so reserve in advance. Food is delicious!Always a high touch of class when the chef comes out to personally check on everyone's meals. Overall, good service!!TIP: try to get a seat in the main dining area versus their back room that is more suited more for hosting a large group than small tables. They use this as an overflow room. The problem with this room is the acoustics, allowing you to hear perfectly every load talker in the room
5
Binomio is an old favourite, but one I've not reviewed before. A friend and I walked in there last night without a reservation. To our surprise both the fine dining restaurant and tapas bar were packed on a Tuesday evening!We were offered a seat in the fine dining area pending availability at the bar, to which we moved after about 15 minutes. Excellent, reasonably priced wine and superb tapas, backed up with great service. They offer a tasting platter of 6 or 8 tapas which is very good value. We ate, amongst other things, the chorizo, lamb chops, Swiss chard and gambas - all well presented and delicious. Their desert range is a little limited, and could do with some enhancement. Otherwise, I rate this restaurant as one of the top Spanish restaurants in Singapore. Go without hesitation
4
Very good food, nice selection of dishes in the menu and very professional staff. We can see these guys know what they are doing. I at at the tapas side , very friendly atmosphere.
5
We have been to this restaurant twice for dinner. Excellent food and decor was very nice. Service was also very good. We recommend it. Don't forget to book days ahead. It is always full.
4
This is by far, the best restaurant I've eaten in Singapore. Everything, from the appetizer, to the salad, main course and desert, were simply delicious! The wine and drinks
4
The food was simply delicious. Even the most simple things was oozing with flavor and taste. The ambience was also top, wether you were only there for a drink or sitting for dinner.
5
Lovely tapas. The executive chef, Jose, n staff, Bang, are great people with great hospitality. Love the mushroom croquet , clayfish, sorry ribs wagyu beef, fruit tartlet. Perfect! Nice ambiance. Rather too pricey though.
5
Binomio (tapas bar) is one of my favorite restaurants in town. The tapas dishes are absolutely delicious- I have always been pleasantly surprised with the quality and taste of the food. They have a rather wide variety of tapas dishes on their menu but some of my favorites and recommended dishes would definitelt be the iberico pork a and mushroom croquette. Do note that the tapas bar menu differs from the restaurant menu.They also offer good cocktails, mocktails (for those who make the mistake of driving there) and a decent wine selection. The cocktails are recommended for those who would like to see the bartenders in action.The service and atmosphere is great as well- the chef took note to serve our tapas dishes only after the earlier dishes have been finished so food was continually served to us. Do not hesitate to strike up a conversation with their staff (such as the bartender) and other friendly diners. One of the great things about binomio is the relaxed and lively ambience.Love the food, service and atmosphere so I will definitely be back again.Tio for dining at binomio: Do make a reservation (even if it is for the tapas bar) at least a day before. Otherwise, be prepared to wait
1
We have eaten at the bar at Binomio several times and found the food and service very good (The bar serves a different menu to the restaurant). Based on our experience at the Bar we booked a table for 4 in the restaurant as a special night out with friends from overseas - what a mistake.We were seated given menus and eventually we had to ask a waiter to take our wine and food order. We ordered Tapas to share and then individual main courses. Two of the Tapas arrived the third was missing in action, we asked the waiter where it was and we were told the kitchen was busy so it would arrive with the main courses...!The side dishes we ordered with the main courses did not arrive until after we had finished the main.Wine glasses were left empty we filled them ourselves. Eventually a waiter walked past saw the glasses were empty (again) picked up our wine bottle poured all the wine into one glass and walked off with the empty bottle without saying a word. We then ordered an additional two glasses of red wine to have with the main course and they were delivered to the table after we had finished dessert.I told the waiter the service was terrible his response was we are busy with a large private group.... My recommendation skip the restaurant (it will cost at least SG120 per head) and stick with the Bar food better value and much better service, that said I was so appalled by the service I doubt if I will ever return
5
We were recommended this place by a spanish friend and we loved it ! The staff is very nice and helpful and the food is to die for ! We shared few tapas as a starter and they were all delicious. The veal chick to follow was amazing, it melted in my mouth ! and then we got the churros for dessert, OMG it was so light and so tasty ! The chef came at the end and spend time to speak to us and take pictures. We had a truly great evening 
3
Heard a lot of good things about Binomio . In fact , I went twice last week ..once in the dining room, and then at the counter. The food is really the problem ! Waiters and waitresses are very very friendly and nice , unfortunately the food is really not good. They probably tinker with the ingredients , compromising with the quality ? You can find exactly the same tapas in Lolla or La Cucina ..and they would simply taste better. Better ham, better cheese, better garlic shrimps or octopus.. Tapas is about quality of the ingredients and Binomio is second tier 
4
Second visit, this time to the main restaurant rather than tapas bar. Once again top quality food and great wine. Trick is to realise there are two separate menus one for bar and one for restaurant . Some of the tapas from the bar menu is worth asking for to mix in especially the chorizo.Like this place a lot... Not up to 22 Ships (Hong Kong ) Quite but not far off
4
The best to me. Great tapas and the cuttlefish linguine is totally unique. Paella a bit on the salty side but tasty. I like their sparking Sangria. Overall expensive but worth it. Must reserve in advance.
4
Very pleasant atmosphere. Good for business, dates or with friends.
Good choice of tapas. Definitely should try the bone marrow one if that's your thing.
Attentive service as well.
3
Came here for my boyfriend's birthday with some friends. Restaurant very nice but terrible service. Had to poor our own wine and keep getting the waiters attention for more ice water on the table. Food slow and rather cold when it came out. They missed the chorizo in our paella and so had to send it back. By the time it came back out we were ready to go. Nice atmosphere though, shame the food didn't live up to the price. Sabio's down the road is a much nicer and more affordable Spanish tapas place.
4
We had a 3 course set lunch. Both the starter (snapper in piquillo peppers and chocolate tart) were utterly delicious. Sadly the main, paella with prawns, clams and chicken was a big let-down. The sauce was extremely flavoured with basil to the extent no other flavour came through. When I say sauce, I'm being generous - there was no liquidy sauce to speak of. Rather the rice was sticky dry-ish and just green flavored from the basil or pesto that was mixed into it. The strangest paella we've ever eaten. The rose champagne was a lovely choice. We enjoyed attentive service, which is a rarity in Singapore restaurants, even when they're fine dining
3
The food cost was crazy. The set up was nice. On my own dime I would not come here as the value proposition was about as poor as it comes. Food was nice, but nothing mind blowing for that sort of cost. All was nice, but, again, the price just blew my mind and I'm glad I did not have to pay for it. That being said, we had good wine and good service
4
I come here a lot and always sit at the bar which serves tapas. Favorite dishes: chorizo, croquettas, gambas, lamb, patatas bravas, Iberico ham and churros for dessert! Wine selection is good value.The restaurant side is more formal- good for business dinners. If there's two of you and you want more privacy or to people watch, try to get bar seating by the windows (facing outside). You can also swing some chairs around the outside (which is also dog-friendly!).Highly recommend this place for dates, dinner with friends, dinner with parents and business dinners
5
Headed to Binomio for the first time last week, and really enjoyed our meal there. We were in a large group, so had the opportunity to try a huge variety of tapas. Service was prompt and our water glasses were re-filled at every opportunity (which I appreciated!) If you do go, do yourself a favour and order the grilled octopus, Iberian pork, the beef short ribs, the seafood paella and the squid ink paella. Those were the real stand outs for me, although my dining companions also loved the quail paella and the anchovies. Will be back - definitely one of the best tapas places in Singapore. Not cheap, but happy to pay for the quality of food since we are 100000 miles away from Spain
2
Ok place. But I think it is overpriced. I had three tapas dishes, a small beer and a glass of wine to a total of 82 SGD. I was especially disappointed when I got charged 25 SGD for a half cold platter (original price 36 SGD) that made me feel ripped off. I made the server aware of this, and she said that they don't usually do half plates. Which is ok, but doesn't explain why they had to overcharge
5
I am so glad to have revisited Binomio after a long time, it is still as good as before, or not, even better. Well, this review will not be the best indication of the whole restaurant as we only sat at the bar for tapas both of the times we were there, but if this is what you're looking for, you definitely have to try it!We entered the place at about 9.30pm and it was still busy at the restaurant. Since we're only interested in the tapas, the bar was where we immediately opt for. The Chef, Chef Marc if I didn't remember his name wrongly, was the one at the bar that night. We opted for the 6 tapas tasting which you can select any 6 tapas from the long list of menu. He made good suggestions as to the portions and to leave one tapas for dessert. So subtle, bespoke and sincere is his service, checking our satisfactions and all. I wouldn't say quite the same for the other wait staffs of the restaurant. The best part about the bar will be to see the actions in progress, the preparation of the tapas and the skills of cooking. Entertaining indeed. Food were so delicious although simplistic.I like the place for its concept and well designated place and delicious tapas, but I really think they need to improve the quality of service. I will never forget saying 'thank you' as I was leaving the restaurant without getting any response, although there were staffs around
4
After trying several times to get a seat at Binomio, we finally managed to get a late seating on a weeknight. It was worth the wait! We enjoyed the tapas, all 8 of them, between the 2 of us! We particularly enjoyed the deep fried eggplant, the chargrilled beef, and the Padron peppers! Yum! The service was good, and although we only had a chance to talk to Zanna, we would like to thank everyone in the team for their hard work and for taking such good care of us! We'll be back soon
5
Very nice experience, very nice food and wine. A bit on the pricey side so keep it for a special occasion.
2
When the chief waiter embarrasses one of your guests by saying "the chef will not be happy with you order" you know the night will be bad. Undercooked meat, average tapas with a premium price tag. Will not be back
4
This is a wonderful spanish restaurant with good food - especially the Tapas. Vegeterian may be a bit challenged but the restaurant is quite accommodating. Wines are a bit expensive and S$ 100 is quite normal - so great food but at a price.
4
Food we tasty, the wait stuff were great. Just be aware it gets busy so book of you can. I would definitely go back especially if I am craving for some delicious paella.
5
Friend and I ordered the set lunch. Everything we ordered was great!
The mushroom soup (soup of the day), poached egg, steak, grilled squid, and chocolate tart with vanilla ice cream.
Would go back again for the set lunch!
3
We loved the atmosphere of the restaurant, especially the bar is attractive and inciting. Not so many wines by the glass offered but the two wines we tried were fantastic, from spain. The grilled squid was not good at all, tasteless, very chewy, and the onions and peppers were not really caramelised. Garlic Prawns were average, lacking some punch. We loved the ham with the tomato. The rest of the things were ok. Half of the staff are nice and engage you on a little chat, but the other half don't smile or look uninterested
5
there is finally an authentic tapas bar in Spore. The tapas are real, tasty and so freshly cooked.We asked to have the suckling pig from the main menu, the waitress was a bit hesitant to say yes, had to check with he chef ( so typical of so many restaurants, this lack of flexibility ), then finally agreed. a bit disappointing and lost few points on attitude and service.for a light meal, seat at the bar, more fun. Only tapas served there. ( unless you insist to have one dish from the a la carte menu )overall very good food, and service. Will come back
3
I went to Binomio for a dinner party with friends. Lovely ambience, knowledgeable waiter and good tasty food. I like this place because it don't serve the run-of-the-mill Spanish tapas like some many Spanish restaurants in Australia. No garlic potato, no grilled chorizo, no garlic prawns etc. It's nice to try different varieties of tapas. We had the meat and cheese platters, mushroom croquettes, sauteed mushroom with rioja style potato and slow cooked egg; vegetable paella, suckling pig, char grilled beef rib-eye, mixed vegetable salads and 6 deserts; 2 jugs of sangria and a mocktail. The food was scrumptious, especially the sautÃ©ed mushroom and the char grilled rib eye, so full of flavour and tender, melts in your mouth. The only issue I had was the price. The food in Singapore are generally very cheap. The bill for our party of 8 was more than SG$100/head. Overall, we had a great night and our bellies were stuffed
4
Been to Binomio 3 times in the last month. After over 20 years living abroad this is likely the best Spanish restaurant ive ever been outside of Spain. A great blend of your ordinary dishes and fine dining at reasonable prices with good service and friendly attitude. Keep it up, guys

We came across Binomio on a website, listing 10 Best Spanish Restaurants in Singapore. It has a very good review, plus we were able to reserve for dinner on last minute.The setting and ambiance is really nice. Posh but not pretentious.Service is really good, they're attentive and helpful.We sat inside and ordered the main dining menu, where they also have tapas counter menu in the bar. The food was very delicious, love them! Iberian cold cuts and cheese, some tapas and wine. We should have ordered Paella, but it was just too heavy for us that evening.We finished our wine at the bar which is overlooking the street, it was nice and chill. And back to our hotel with a smile and full tummy :)I admit it was quite expensive, but also a good experience, we were only there for the weekend so what the heck.Very glad to have found this restaurant since Spanish restaurant in Jakarta is almost non-existence

Went there on a Saturday night out with friends.It was very busy but the service was attentive, except the bill which took a while. Quality of food was excellent - mushrooms and Piccolo peppers were outstanding. Paella was also very good. Wine list also good. Highly recommended.

This is the second time we've eaten in Binomio and returned on this trip to Singapore as we enjoyed the first visit so much. Sadly we only had one night in the city this time so choosing to return was a compliment indeed. The restaurant is stylish, modern and restrained. You can sit at the front of the restaurant near the bar and enjoy the tapas menu or at the back where more formal dining is on offer.We hadn't booked but as it was a Monday night we took a chance. It paid off luckily but having said that the restaurant was very busy so I would recommend booking.For some reason there was a mix up with our pre-dinner cocktails so we did have to jog memories but other than that the service was faultless. The menu (Spanish) varied and interesting with fabulous tapas on offer. We had drinks in the tapas bar then took a table at the rear for our main course. This visit we had squid paella (for two) with a perfectly chilled bottle of rose - quite delicious. During our previous visit we tucked into tapas and the dishes were authentic and very more-ish with a chef cooking many of them in front of you just behind the bar.The staff are friendly and professional - many are from Spain and have that lovely warm, friendly and happy attitude you can still find around the Mediterranean (though it's getting harder to find!). We chatted to the head chef who came into the restaurant and he was charming - friendly, interesting and clearly passionate about food.Although smart and modern the restaurant still manages to be welcoming and relaxed and if you need a hit of 'Western' food whilst in the Far East this is a great place to find it

Binomio consists of 2 sections. A tapas bar at the front with counter seating and a "sit down" restaurant at the back. Both menus are different.We ate in the restaurant. The menu offers a wide variety of choices form Tapas to more substantial meals, including grilled meats and Paella. All the dishes we had we very good. The service was excellent and very welcoming which is the main reason (not to detract from the quality of the food) why we would go back to the restaurant. We found the Spanish staff very knowledgeable about the food and wine and very personable.Cost per person excluding the wine was about S$100.Will make this restaurant one of our regulars. Booking is a necessity
4
Very cute set up with tapas bar alongside the main restaurant and both offering different menus.This place is very popular for good reason so our late booking only guaranteed us a place at the tapas bar.Nonetheless the food was very good along with good service . All the tapas we tried was very tasty and well cooked especially the presentation of the chorizo and Manchego cheese. The pasta paella was however not my cup of tea but the wife loved it.Def return visit but with plenty booking in advance . To put in context .. Nicer venue than atherton s 22 ships in Hong Kong but tapas not as good
5
Fantastic tapas as starters, made with fresh ingredients (a lot flown in from Spain) and beautifully cooked. Main course was paella - one of the best I've ever eaten in or out of Spain.This is really good Spanish food! And having been twice, we will definitely be going again.On the fringe of Chinatown

This restaurant was really highly reviewed so hubby and I were keen to try it out. There is a very fun looking bar at the front serving tapas and a white table clothed restaurant at the back also serving tapas but much larger portions. We had a variety of dishes that were nice, but definitely not fantastic, except for the mushroom croquettes, these were very yum. The lamb was fatty and chewy and difficult to eat and the baby squid was deep fried and tasted of nothing at all. It was too chewy and something I would expect at a cheap pub lunch. The portions at the restaurant are quite large and not your usual small tapas. We definitely prefer smaller dishes so we can have a variety, hence why we love spanish food. Would we go again?......not the restaurant, but we will try the bar at the front with tapas
5
I've been a food snob unfortunately my whole life and writing a good review for a restaurant would be a first for me. I've tried many Spanish restaurants in Singapore and this place takes the cake. Better than Esquina, better then Sabio and definitely much, MUCH better than the overly hyped Catalunya. Excellent food, and even better service.....,this place will leave you craving for more. Always listen to what Eduardo has to recommend. The palate will be satisfied and no food will be wasted due to over-ordering
5
A little miracle happened when we just walked in without reservation and .... got a table ( only thanks to a last minute cancellation) . With hindsight: what fools we were, thinking that a Wednesday evening will be "quiet"! Despite of being full to the last seat: What an a outstanding restaurant, delicious Tapas, fine wine ( possible by glass), artistic desserts and friendly, attentive and extremely professional staff. Reserve three days ahead! Viva EspaÃ±a!

If you look at the competition along Craig road/Duxton, it goes without saying that you need to be better than average to survive. Chef Jose Alonso and his attentive team are definitely a cut above the rest. The ambience is warm and cosy. Food is simple, food flavors clean and fresh and service is unhurried, good level of chatter.The menu is updated often depending on availability of fresh ingredients from Spain, making sure the list to order from is always new.I have been here 3-4 times and the squid ink paella, Coca bread topped w Anchovies, char grilled pork w leeks and romesco sauce and even the humble grilled piquillos. Had lovely Red Sangria to go along the tapas and finished off w a whisky cake w toasted egg yolk- Dashing dessert but it is a bit too sweet for my liking.Will keep coming back here for more
5
A fresh change of scene from the myriad of Italian restaurants in Spore.Binomia served up a fine menu of mains and tapas, as well as muy mouthwatering desserts (their Whisky cake with egg yolk topping was worth every calorie).I appreciated the waiter's suggestions (that plus wine and desserts, 1 main and 2 tapas were sufficient when we started to over order; and his dessert recommendations). The portions were just nice for 2 person-sharing.Prices bordered on the high side. Still it's a nice restaurant to meet up a friend in
5
Had a range of Tapas followed by the Lamb Shoulder. All very tasty. Service and environment perfect whether for Business or Personal.
5
My fav were the crayfish tapas, beef cubes tapas and the squid ink paella. The ribeye was also delicious, flavourful and cooked well. Service was also excellent and chef made an effort to come check if everything was ok.
5
Excellent food, service and ambience!! Definitely will go back again!! I will recommend Binomio to my friends.
4
Good Spanish restaurants are hard to find but this one of them. Only reason I did not give five stars is due to just average service.
4
I've passed Binomio many many times, and finally decided to check it out with a girlfriend. She's vegetarian, so we shared veg friendly tapas and a bottle of wine. The suggested bottle of red was excellent and reasonably priced (SGD 65....amazing to get a good wine at this price point in Singapore), and the tapas were fantastic. Nice ambience and good service. Packed on a Tuesday. I definitely hope to go back
5
Binomio was recommended to me by another member of the Spanish Expat community in Singapore. I'm usually skeptical of "Spanish" restaurants in Asia, as preparations are usually adapted, often times too much, to please a local clientèle, and ingredients are creatively described as "genuine", when they are not. Please be assured, Binomio is on a different league.This place is a treat. The best Spanish food I've had for a long time in Asia. Be it the Tapas Bar, where Houssein reigns supreme, or the Dining Room, where Eduardo runs things to perfection, the experience is as good as it gets, and definitely the top Spanish Table in Singapore, and I've tried a few.Very good Ham and Pan con Tomate, great Tortilla de Patatas, excellent Croquetas de Jamón and Croquetas de Champiñones, and the list is endless.They cook rice to perfection. I tried their Paella Mixta (Chicken and seafood rice) which was EXCELLENT, and I observed as portions of Arroz Negro (Squid-Ink Rice) were served to other tables, which also looked great.No surprise, the place is back-to-back packed and reservations at the restaurant are a must. You'll not regret coming to this one, and you'll keep coming back
5
Excellent Spanish food. Rare to find in Singapore- this is the real deal. It was a bit pricey, especially if you have ever been to Spain (and compared prices), but that is to be expected in Singapore. Service was excellent. I recommend the Squid ink rice mmm
5
I had already visited this restaurant other times. They have renewed the choice to adapt to the demand with more variety on tapas, even if the main course choice remains, from my view a bit short. This is something I am sure they are reviewing.The experience continues being, anyway, fantastic. The quality of food is excellent, with some modernism in the traditional Spanish dishes offered, which is great. Service, outstanding, as usual. Large demand so I recommend to book with some anticipation.I have no other thing to say but to strongly recommend to visit this great restaurant.Chef Jose Alonso is doing a great job
2
Had high expectations as a Spanish food lover and after reading some reviews. The place looks nice however the service was slow and the food wasnt really up to minimum standards. The tapas were really small and poorly seasoned , the Jamon was ok but have had much better ones. Now when the Paella came was even more dissapointing. They commited the sin of putting some sort of pesto sauce strips over the rice which was overcooked. We counted 6 small praws, 5 mussles & 6 pieces of unseasoned chicken for a whole Paella !!! Then came the Arroz Negro [Squid Ink rice] which was totally bland and under seasoned and again they put the strips of Pesto which in this case did bring a bit of flavor. We asked for some salt to be able to finish eating it and to make it worse there was VERY little calamari's on it. A real pity as the place does look nice but food and service were really a let down. Not planning to be back anytime soon
4
I came here twice in a span of 1 week as I was really in love with the food! Overall the service was good and the restaurant was fully booked both times I was there. It was a little hot and stuffy inside the restaurant though. I also felt that it was a little pricey. Portions are small, but that is to be expected of tapas.
4
The food for absolutely delicious. The portion are quite reasonable if you compare to other tapas restaurant. I love the mushroom croquette. so much!
Will coma back with friends again.
5
this is one of the authentic spanish restaurant in town. do try their prawn bacon and also their chuross ! definitely recommended. and please make rsvp as it can be crowded even in weekdays.
5
Had another outstanding meal at Binomio last Thursday. The tapas is amazing, and the ribeye and pork were perfection. Great wine list still.
4
Have been here many times with friends and family.. and still coming back for more. Love the cheese terrines and the Spanish octopus plus the red wine sangria!!
Will be back soon.
5
This restaurant has it all: great location, excellent service and amazing food. The tapas are delicately prepared with very fine produce and food. The paella with squid ink is a true marvel! Despite our booking we had to wait for 15 min to be seated; we did not complain but still they offered us two desserts
5
For me is the best Spanish restaurant in Singapore at the moment and the best I ever tried outside Spain. Traditional Spanish cuisine putting the focus in the product. Two atmospheres bar and restaurant. Preferred meals are black ink noodles and the aged beef. Spanish Omelette in the bar is also a must. Wines are affordable for Singapore standards and all the staff is really friendly and helpful. Reservation in advance is a must for weekends
5
We shared the Seleccion de Ibericos platter which was more than enough for 3. We all loved the 4 different cold cuts which were very tasty. I had the Char-grilled Iberic pork which was to my expectation,i.e, succulent! One friend had the Wagyu veal Shank and the other, Grilled fish of the day. The churros were very light and crispy. We were more than satisfied with the food
4
We took a number of clients here (8 of us in total) and had a great meal. We did a mass order to share of different dishes so that everyone could get the full experience of their nicely varied menu.The best dish from my point of view was Cochinillo â€œa la Segoviana" which was a roast suckling pig and was really very good indeed as was the slow cooked egg.We noticed on the reviews before that the service was not good, we found it to be professional and fast, however the restaurant on our visit was not very full
5
It is quite difficult to get good Spanish food in Singapore. Our hunt for good Spanish cuisine ends at Binomio. Diners can choose to sit in the fine dining or bar dining area. It served decent Sangria. We enjoyed the cold cut and the pork belly appetisers. We also shared the pallea and suckling mains. The chicken & seafood paella deserved the highest rating. This was the best i had ever tasted in Singapore. The grains were evenly cooked! The flavours were so intense and aromatic. It was so good that the other delicious dishes paled in comparison. The service staff were friendly and helpful. The fare was not quite on the affordable side. Be prepare to pay S$100 per person for food & drinks. I will definitely return for more and will recommend this restaurant to anyone who fancy Spanish food in Singapore.
2
We sat at the bar, looking out onto the street, and ordered an array of tapas. The food was underseasoned, the squid tapas were gritty, and the olive dish consisted of black olives from a can (really?) The patatas bravas were the star of the show. Service was poor -- after asking for our check and watching our waiter help two other tables, we finally had to camp out at the host station to pay. First time in two years in Singapore that I even considered having the service fee rescinded. On the plus side, the wine was excellent. We might return if we're just looking for drinks, but never again for the tapas. Perhaps the dinner experience is better, but based on the tapas this is most definitely not the best Spanish restaurant in town
5
Great food, Great Atmosphere and the beef was to die for just melted in the mouth. This is a very classy joint definitely not low rent back backer hangout, get dressed to impress here.
5
Came here several times with friends (some spanish) and I always loved it.
from the very simple tortilla de patatas to the black ink paella.
Good service, well trained staff and a friendly Chef! ;)
5
Their paella con pollo y mariscos (the chicken and seafood paella) was the best! excellent service:)
1
We went on a Tuesday night. Booked in advanced for 5. But was given a table for 4. One side of the table was against the wall. One of us have to sit at the other side facing the wall eventhough the Resaturant was quite empty that night. Serving staff did't quite attend to us unless and untill we called them. At the end of the meal, after given them my credit card for payment. They returned my card and receipt and left them on the table without even asked me to sign. After signing we walked out but no one said a word of thank you. Did we spend too little that they were not happy with us ?? The bill was $589.68 for 5
5
We're a spanish couple and we love to go here every now and then to eat some good tapas. The flavours are really like they are in Spain.Our favourite tapas:- Tortilla de patatas- Chorizo con Manchego- Gambas al ajillo- Croquetas (both)- Secreto ibÃ©ricoAnd, of course, a Estrella Galicia beer
4
We walked in, as full for bookings when we called. The very friendly Spanish waiter asked us to wait, and got us a drink when waiting. We got a table outside, reasonable price drinks, and great tapas...the mushroom one was amazing! Very pleased with excellent service, and reasonable prices. Def would come again
4
I had heard a lot of good stories about Binomio and from a food perspective I wasn't disappointed. The Tapas were all well cooked and delicious although my only criticism regarding the food as that anyone worth his salt should know that the sign of a good paella is the thin crust on the bottom of the pan and in this respect Binomio did not deliver. I had tried booking a table but was told that they had no availability and then was contacted back to say they had a cancellation. I would say that throughout the meal the restaurant was at best about 70% full. The service was just OK, on a couple of occasions I had to get up and get my own wine to pour as there was a lack of staff available. If they can iron out the tweaks I would definitely go back but let's just say as it currently stands its a tick in the box and there are better tapas restaurants in Singapore
5
I love Binomio. Hands down our favorite (and perhaps best) tapas in Singapore.There's two parts to Binomio, the restaurant which has a more formal dining menu and requires reservations (maybe 2 weeks in advance per staff guidance - I guess they are popular!) but my review is for the bar area and the more casual tapas menu.The bar is walk-in only but there's usually plenty of seating when you come in on a weeknight or a little earlier or later in the evening on weekends. They have a simple tapas menu and you can order cocktails/wine. They have a fantastic 6-tapas deal for $69 where you can order 6 different tapas dishes at a great price. Love the chorizos, croquettes, iberico ham, squid ink paella, spanish tortilla... the list goes on! Can't go wrong w/ anything on the menu. The serving sizes are pretty good so with 2 people you'll leave stuffed. With 3, a comfortable tapas experience. They also have a 9-tapas option.They have an extensive array of gin and tonic cocktails and all are delicious! Do drop by Binomio if you're in town or in the neighborhood in Singapore
5
This is a real delight.Delicious and authentic Spanish food with very reasonably priced wines.We had some simple grilled vegetables which were crisp and refreshing.Then the seafood and chicken paella which was truly superb.Friendly and efficient service in a packed dining room made the whole experience really memorable.I shall become a regular.This is one of the best restaurants in Singapore beyond doubt
3
We were quite excited to try out Binomio with my wife. Especially after the excellent reviews posted. However, our overall experience was not that great for the following reasons:- Although we could manage to book a table (1 week before), it was not ready when we arrived- Not to mention the delay to be welcomed and cold attitude from the staff- We were only invited to wait at the counter...... without any chair to sit in. - It is only after having complained that things started to improve: * the staff brought us high-chairs * we had complimentary drink and appetizers- Since the table was still not ready half an hour after, we decided to try out some tapas on the counter. We then had a really very good food experience with cod-fish and lamb tapas. - Only after having requested for the bill that the table became ready (1 hour after the initial booking time)
4
Entertained there with friends, celebrated my son's birthday with a small dinner party . Food was excellent especially suckling pig which was my favorite. And I would give the churros a miss either,
5
Great restaurant, with everything working fine: food simply fantastic, great attention, nice ambient. Spanish modern cuisine, delicious
Highly advisable, great experience!
5
I usually feel disappointed in most Spanish restaurants I go overseas (I am Spanish and I like cooking...). I was recommended by a friend, and it was worth the visit. Even the "croquetas" that normally I am very demanding with, were super smooth and yummy. We had "chipirones" salad, fish staffed red peppers and fish "vizcaina" style. Nothing wrong to say, all was very good quality. Prices are a bit high, but quality is very good. They also have a good Selection of sherry wines. Good for romantic dinner and friends gathering, Don't miss it
4
Went here with friends last week on Saturday after recommendation about the chefs, staff and operators ( i think its 4 or 6 spanish chefs doing their own thing)Setting is great, as Singapore is continuously expanding its, further out but now near where most of the good restaurants moved near to. Excellent food quality from presentation through to presentation. Excellent service. The octopus was a very tasty dishWe sat at the tapa bar / bar area on the left as entering as we didn't feel so formal as to sit in the restaurant area - i can imagine it gets busy so book ahead.Eduardo was extremely communicative and i think either the owner or similar but part of the team establishing .....Highly recommended of the ever growing Singapore restaurant number
4
I went there with my work colleagues and with no knowledge or expectations. It was really well patronised and that reflects well on the restaurant. The staff were good, the menu was good, the food was good but the wine list was spanish only. All in all we had a really good time although perhaps less wine and more food would have been good. Friendly staff so my end verdict was a very good night
5
We walked in without a reservation on Saturday night. Offered seat at the bar without hesitation. Ordered several tapas including fish, pork ribs, lamb racks and prawn special. Little disappointed that the razor clams special had run out, but what we did have was really fresh, delicious and well presented.We finished with chocolate desert and churros which were both devine. The service was excellent with staff being very attentative and informative. The atmosphere was buzzing. We would highly recommend Binomio for a great night out
3
Binomio was highly recommended by a friend who insisted it was the best Spanish restaurant in Singapore. Since it was my wife's birthday and she loves Spanish food I made a reservation pointing out that it was her birthday. Also confirmed the day before, reiterating we were celebrating. THE FOOD excellent, everything meticulous in preparation. THE SERVICE ok at best, as we always felt we had to flag someone down for every aspect, ordering, refills, clearing the table. The bill did arrive quickly. SPECIAL OCCASION? Fail. As we patiently waited for the promised cake and candle, well nothing. With the dinner at over two hours i paid the bill (not cheap) and thought to myselfâ€¦."Special occasion, made forgettable"
4
Was at Binomio for dinner with my buddy, thought we'll try a Spanish restaurant and that's where we ended up. Few choices of wine by glass as we're not going to have a bottle for the night. ordered the cod tapas and it was a mistake! The cod tasted overcooked or frozen fish, my buddy told me it doesn't taste cod. It was a missed. Finally comes the paella! It's smell excite us when the waitress showed it to us before dividing up. I'm not a rice fan but my bowl was cleaned! Drooling now that I'm typing the paella encounter. Could come back another day
4
I went with my family to this restaurant & the whole family enjoyed the dining experience. Food was good but the service was better. Way to go! There were a few starters that the children really enjoyed & it was not too spicy for them. Since it was my son's birthday, they surprised us with a little, cute dessert. Nice touch
5
This was a great spot, they have a tapas bar at the front and restaurant at the back - the food is very very good and the atmosphere is simply buzzing - you have to book !! We hd house wine this time, which was very good and all in all it was one of the best value for money (BUT HIGH QUALITY), dinners we'd had in a while. Definate recommendation
4
Have visited Binomio several times in the past few months. I have always enjoyed it but in recent visits the place seems to be improving. Service has been excellent, and the food is now really good. My favorite Spanish restaurant in Singapore.
5
Our lunch started off modestly with a bottle of Estrella Damm Inedit beer, it was a good start to quench us from this warm afternoon. What followed almost knocked us off our chairs. Those heavenly creation by Chef Jose was simply WOW! This was a gastronomical sensation of taste, smell, texture and presentation. The Char-grilled Pork belly, Pan fried Cray fish, Squid Ink paella were just few that worth mentioning. Service was impeccable but friendly. Ambient was warm and comfortable. Thanks to Eduardo for taking control of our perfect food and wine selection. Binomio, you had raised the bar in Singapore
5
Binomio is, out of doubt, the best choice for trying real Spanish food. Most part of Spanish restaurants are not real Spanish. My advice: if there is no Spanish people around (either staff or customers) just ask yourself why. Binomio is the favourite place for Spanish expats. And not only food is amazing, service is also great. Eduardo and the beautiful Maria are as friendly as professional, making the whole experience unique.This restaurant is a must
5
the place is so good, that i went back twice...excellent wine selection, very reasonable prices for singaporethe food, be it at the tapas bar or in the restaurant was divinely exquisite Maria, who works there, really makes you feel a VIP special client... looooved i
5
There are many "fake" spanish restaurants in Singapore staffed with cheap migrant cooks who have never been to Spain, purporting to serve "authentic spanish food".Fortunately, Binomio is not one of them.Founded by ex-chefs from Santi and other top restaurants in Singapore, Binomio serves very good quality Galician and spanish cuisine but in a refined setting.Mussel Croquette and Squid Ink Paella are both very memorable dishes.Wine list is also very good, with selections from Spain and the inner regions.Little bit pricey, but thats Singapore in general
5
A great place to come with friends or family.The place is split with a bar servicing tapas and drinks and a more up-scale restaurant area. My preference is the bar, because it is a great vibe, quite chilled, and you can watch the world go by on the window seats - whilst sipping your drink and enjoying the delightful tapas dishes on offer.Not the cheapest place, but service and quality of food is unforgettable. Try to squid/octopus - simple delicious :
4
We went there with 12 pax for a Friday dinner. The food was very tasty and the red wine was excellent. The atmosphere is relaxed and quite, which is good for having conversations with several people around the large table.We will certainly go there again
4
Walk in for tapas and sat by the window which was nice. Order 6 tapas for $69 for 2 which was more than enough. Food was really good and particularly enjoyed the pork belly and scrimps food came out at good intervals and staff were good. I could recommend the bar area and tapas didn't try the resturant
5
This place can boast some of the best service in Singapore, not high praise I know, but the staff are knowledgeable and pleasant and make for a fun evening. Maria, from Barcelona, is an excellent host. To start we had the Serrano ham which comes with a very nice tomato salsa and nicely toasted bread ; then the cuttlefish tapas which was excellent and we highly recommend it, For the main we shared the squid ink seafood paella - very good just wish the portion was bigger for a dish meant to be shared. Improvement could be made to the lower end wines - you would need to be loco to order the Como Loco. Restaurants can find much better wines in the $50 range. Corkage is exorbitant at $45 but they will do one for one, which is fine if you have a party of 4. Overall a pleasant dining experience
5
If you are craving for REAL Spanish cuisine, based on premium quality products, with a pinch of creativity, your search is over. Binomio is your place with no doubt.As the name implies, you enter in a two ambient restaurant serving a selection of tapas and imported wines that can make your night or be the beginning of a great culinary adventure.Budget wise, you can feel that you are paying for excellent quality food, perhaps some of the tapas could be more generous, but that's because you really enjoyed them.The other part of the restaurant is a fine-dining space focused on making the customer enjoy the flavors of each one of the dishes he will be served.With a prompt and well-trained service, the restaurant has been really well decorated with class and style. Just a few evocations to some places of Spain, but don't expect the classic "Spanish themed" restaurant.To enhance your experience, ask Chef Jose to come out and explain you each one of the dishes, he will be delighted to do so....in fact, you will not have to ask for him, he is usually around. ;)Don't miss the squid ink paella, or the "croquetas" at the tapas zone....and the GOSUA!!! One of the best desserts I've ever tasted
5
It just keeps commin. Order from the bar and keep share plates coming to the delight of the entire gang. The tapas food quality is the best in town and the atmosphere fun and lively.
4
Have had been to the restaurant twice. Once for tapas at the bar and once at the main dining room. The atmosphere is good, think it great for dates and hanging out some friends and still have a conversation without screaming at the top of your lungs. Service is friendly, pretty decent wine list at good prices. Food is both the tapas bar and at the main dining area is great! They especially awesome with seafood! All the seafood dishes was sublime! The crayfish... oooooohhhhhh... so good! ::D The squid ink paella was really good. can't wait to go down the third time
5
We know Eduardo well from when he used to run La Cicala in Club St (which sadly closed its doors recently). His new home is more impressive with, we are told, six Spanish chefs beavering away in the kitchen.The food is quite superb. We started with delicious little cups of tomato gazpacho, followed by a generous platter of Jamon de Serrano with toasted bread and the most tasty fesh tomato purée. Then came melt-in-the-mouth ham and cheese croquettas, followed by a green salad topped with deep fried baby chiperones (squid) - the salad was imaginatively dressed in black squid ink. After this we had a beautiful soft light cheese drizzled with honey which we spread on more toasted bread. Then there was warm baby octopus with little rounds of potato, but the piece de resistance came at the very end in the form of little rounds of thick juicy crayfish wrapped in Serrano ham, delicious! All washed down with a beautiful medium bodied Tempranillo, this was an outstanding meal and we will definitely be coming back soon

Binomio is part of the Spanish Tapas explosion that is so currently de rigeur in Singapore right now. Binomio has aimed a level down from some of it's more auspicious contemporaries and whilst it gets many things right, the food which is after all the main thing is lacking a little.The restaurant has a great atmosphere and the staff are very helpful if a little rushed given that the restaurant was packed when we were there.The wine list is highly accessible for all with good value Spanish wines. Staff knowledge of the list is also good.We had a good time and given the value for money we are possibly being a little overly harsh but the food just didn't seem upto the standard of everything else. We wouldn't write the place off and will probably go again but would like to see the cuisine improve for sure
5
We were supposed to try Binomio twice before but each time, something came up at the last minute causing us to have to cancel. Hence, yesterday when we suddenly thought of it again and could actually go, we tried ringing but were told they were full but we could try the tapas bar as walk-ins. That was what we did and we certainly did not regret it!We were seated at the edge of the tapas bar but the servers and manager made sure that we were not neglected. Most of the staff stopped by constantly to check on how we were doing. We ordered 2 tapas from the Main Dining menu - the panfried cuttlefish and the pan fried baby octopus. Both were really yummy. We also ordered two tapas from the tapas menu - huevas binomio and the Iberian pork. Huevas consisted of paradera potatoes, poached egg and jamon. They were all really yummy. Portions were just nice for the two of us. We had two glasses of Spanish red wine (recommended by the staff), beer and eventually ordered a glass of the red sangria, which was very refreshing. We then had the sticky rice dessert which turned out to be superb and exactly what I like in a dessert - sweet with a little sourish twist to it! The tapas chef was so sweet as he presented my husband and I with a complimentary strawberry dessert each, which we really enjoyed as well - it was simple, not too heavy and just nice to finish off our dinner.We have made plans to return with some friends next Saturday and are looking forward to trying out more of the dishes from the Main Dining menu, in particular, the squid ink paella and the suckling pig. What my husband and I really liked about this place is that the staff really looked after us, were very friendly and even advised us not to over order until we have tried out the initial dishes. We are certainly looking forward to next Saturday
2
We went with a group of people last week and the food was not that great... the best dish on the menu was probably the gazpacho besides that, I honestly didnt think any of the dishes stood out. However there was a very friendly wait staff that did seem to be quite knowledgeable. With the number of F&B choices around Singapore now I will probably not go back there

Fantastic meal from start to finish, lovely restaurant and an owner his clearly very passionate about food.We ordered a couple of dishes from the menu (the pork belly and razor clams being a highlight) but we really stuck to the specials and the things that probably weren't even on a 'specials' menu at all. We were treated to a string of carefully prepared dishes and none failed to impress. The food is just very good here, not pretentious or even all that fussy, it's just very well executed.An extensive Spanish wine list with plenty of good Rioja's to choose from, it all just worked so well.Looking forward to returning, (if I can get a table)

I was feeling jaded and need of a 'pick-me-up' after a difficult start to the week. A friend recommended this place and I went alone to chill out. Easy and plentiful parking nearby helped set the mood. It was quiet when I arrived and the atmosphere in the restaurant was calming.I probably over-ordered a succession of tapas and started off with a complimentary cold zucchini soup. The iberico ham came next; thinly cut and served with a delicious tomato salsa. The duck terrine was served with an apple jam and the chargrilled pork belly with razor clams - all really tasty with many flavours to savour. Accompanying all this was a crusty artisanal bread, freshly toasted whenever I wanted more. Had a small dessert wine to finish. By the time all this was done, I was in a much better frame of mind.I was looking out for what other diners were having and the roast suckling pig and the chuleton looked really tempting. I shall be bringing my meat loving friends to try those - an soon

Without a doubt, there’s definitely been a proliferation of Spanish tapas bars/restaurants in Singapore in the past year or so. The IT cuisine of 2012 doesn’t seem to be losing favour anytime soon though, and if places like Binomio continue to maintain the standards and dedication they have in putting out a fabulous Spanish meal, this trend really should be going on and on.Binomio – well, first off, it’s a concept blending a 2-in-1, there’s a tapas bar, very attractive really because it’s street-side, so makes for good people-watching while nibbling the more casual tapas bites offered at the bar. Further in, it’s the fine-dining area, sophisticated and modern, with great service to boot.I’ve been to Binomio a few times now, to experience both the tapas and the fine-dining, and have never been disappointed. Even the ubiquitous, almost obligatory, Meatballs that are served in most Spanish establishments, are particularly tasty here, the meat not overcooked, moist and in a squid ink sauce. The Piquillo peppers, Chorizo, Iberico Ham, Sauteed Prawns, Croquettas, all are winners here too – and make a filling tapas experience, all washed down with good house wines at only $10/glass each, amazing price for Singapore really. A bottle of house wine here is only $42, which really is an unbelievable price for the location and the restaurant.Now, if the above tapas dishes don’t seem too exciting, that’s because, as the manager pointed out, the tapas area serves more of the typical, expected variations, but in the restaurant area is where it gets exciting and you can find a lot more innovative dishes coming your way. In fact, for a great night out, I’d say make that reservation for dining. Must-tries are the Pan-fried Cuttlefish strips – they are silky smooth, tagliatelle-like strands that you would never imagine is actually cuttlefish in an emulsified veal jus. I also really like the Baby Octopus, on a bed a mashed potato. However, without a doubt, my favourite dish in this restaurant, is the Squid-ink paella. It’s the best I’ve had, creamy rice chockfull of seafood, with the saccarat (crusty base formed at the bottom of the pan) adding some lovely bite to the dish. It’s a dish for 2, so the 1st time we ordered it, they showed us the pan before whisking it off to serve it out on plates for us, so we never got to scrape the best bits, but the second time, we made sure we requested for the pan to be left on the table, and oh, happy days!We were abit concerned about the price of the paella, for the 2 of us to dine there, coupled with a few tapas and drinks, plus the $70 paella, we thought it was expensive but really good – but here’s the thing. We went back with another couple, and thanks to some smart ordering, plus always good to go with more people so you can order more tapas to share, stick to the house wine, and really, it turned out to be great value for the quality and experience you get!This place, is my favourite Spanish restaurant here, and the service staff are so welcoming, definitely worth several visits in future

Been wanting to try this as a friend said he preferred it to Catalunya, which I had loved. The chef, Jose, is ex-Santi, from the Rioja region of southern Spain and I would say this restaurant serves more traditional fare than Catalunya. Three of us shared 4 tapas, the Jamon Pata Negra (Iberico or black pig, free range acorn-fed) was truly outstanding and at $38, a relatively good deal for Singapore. We also had the mushroom coquettas, the cuttlefish in veal jus (thinly sliced to resemble linguine or Mee pok) and Riojan vegetable stew with an organic egg on top. All were excellent, flavourful. We shared a main of suckling pig, served with garlic purée, frisée salad and some parsnips. Also delicious. The wine available by the glass was a Eioja, very reasonable at $10 a glass. For dessert we shared the brownie with thyme ice cream, and coco piña, barbecued pineapple cubes with coconut ice-cream. We felt they faltered in desserts which were not that interesting. Overall a great experience. We received good service even as the restaurant filled up. Chef Jose came over to chat, he very enthusiastically explained how he prepares the pig, and the servers were all professional, unobtrusive. I would definitely recommend it and would go back.We saw the set lunch menu, it looked like a really good deal at 3 courses for $45
