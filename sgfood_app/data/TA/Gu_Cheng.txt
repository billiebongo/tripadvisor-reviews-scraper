Came here bases on good reviews online with a reservation.Owners are really lovely and friendly, I let the gentleman decide what to try (he chose the carrot cake for me) which was out of the world! Nothing like the hawker centre version, this one comes with prawns, shrimp floss? and lard pieces. The sambal kangkong was nice too.They do a lunch deal, for $9.90 you get a main course, a side and a drink

2 friends came to check this out. Only so much we can eat. So Prawn noodles, char kway teow, sambal mackeral and sambal kang kong. All good, except Char Kway teow . I also tried the Penang Laksa broth as I like it mild. This was good and I'll probably have this next time.Pleasant clean place. Good staff, casual and comfortable
