I visited this place with friends. The food is very unique and tasty. Vegetarian tasting menu has very good variety. The views from the restaurant are nice too. Prior reservation is mostly a must and it is advisable to ask for a suitable table.

Doesn’t get much better than this! Food and view! Thankyou to the staff who made this a special lunch for us. We selected the Chefs degustation so every dish was an innovative surprise.

Just had dinner in Jaan for birthday. This place has a stunning view overlooking the city at 70th Floor. It is a small place, definitely less than 20 tables in total. As one of the reviews earlier pointed out, there is a good distance between table and table. There is a good crowd considering it is a mid weekday.Before we were given the menu, they asked if we wanted a glass of champagne.They offered 3 types of Krug Champagne; Krug, Grande Cuvee, Brut Rose. We had the Rose and the Grande Cuvee. For meals, we choose 7 course meal with a bottle of wine. Each of the course served was beautifully plated and explained to us. We enjoyed each of the dish except the "forest pigeon" because the taste was too strong, it tasted very much like liver and we are not a fan of liver. hence, this is our least favourite dish. The service was top-notch. Nothing to fault on them. Each waiter / waitress are very attentive. Perhaps the only comment i have is that the food is being served very fast. When the sourdough rye bread just arrived, the next dish came shortly after that before we had a chance to eat the bread. Nevertheless, everything else was near perfection.Since it was a birthday dinner, we were given a complimentary birthday cake as well. There are 4 other tables which also celebrated the birthday and a proposal. It is definitely a romantic place for special occasion. We left the place with a big smile and big stomach. Somehow the 7 course made us SO full!!

Outstanding brilliance. we had the 10 course surprise tasting menu, every course was exquisite and well balanced. Some fun elements added to the dishes. The staff were great, very professional, but warm and welcoming.Wine pairing was well executed. The location is stunning, our table over looked the marina bay on the 67th floor. We wouldn’t hesitate in going back.

Romantic place. There is a good distance between table and the table, if good luck can have perfect see view face the sands hotel or Ferris wheel.Good presentation for food. Foie gras is very smooth, Scallops is full of flavor from sea. Sommelier intentions introduced

a 1-michelin star restaurant located in Stamford Road. Had a family dinner there, selected the 10-course menu. Place is small but does not feel cosy. Music that was played is rather noisy, mix of indie, pop, etc. which does not seem to match the type of restaurant. Food is good but not fantastic. with some truffle in most dishes, seems a little over-use
5
My husband and I went to Jaan to celebrate his birthday. We had Chef’s 6 course signature lunch set and enjoyed it very much. What we loved were the flavours bursting from each dish meticulously curated by the gorgeous Chef Kirk Westaway and the knowledgeable and immaculately polite service staff.Will let the pictures do the talking:1. Amuse Bouche - almost looked too beautiful to be eaten 2. Warm truffle and potato bits soup - my favourite and most memorable3. Even the warm bread with seaweed butter was mind-blowing4. 1st course - Majestic Irish oyster5. Egg in an egg6. Scottish scallop in truffle and Foie Gras sauce7. Snapper in pumpkin sauce8. Forest pigeon9. Orange and orange zest palette cleanser - not shown but absolutely refreshing 10. Orgasmic chocolate dessert served personally by the gorgeous chef himself11. Petit Four - compliments from the chef12. Krug Champagne and coffeeLast but not least, we loved the cosy setting which had a view of beautiful Singapore (thank goodness we requested and got a window seat). Keep up the good work, Jaan

Our dinner (January 2018) was truly exceptional. The 7 courses menu is very well balanced (seafood, meat, egg, vegetable). all courses are exquisite. A special reward for the first soup (before to start the 7 courses) and the "egg in the egg". A real success. We had dinner with a bottle of champagne rosé; it went well with all dished. The service is perfect (special mention to the French lady who serves wine who is very attentive and to the Italian who explains well the dishes). We loved it and think that the restaurant deserves more than one macaron to the Michelin guide
5
while visiting Singapore selected Jaan for dinner...the dining experience was absolutely fantastic...my wife and i both had the 7 course seasonal set menu...every course was well-prepared, deliciously-balanced, and superbly presented...my #1 course was the "eggs in an egg" (see pictures of presentation and food"; close next fav was the "forest pigeon"...even the "pre-appetizer" was amazing...to complete the dining experience, manager Simone Macri was friendly and patient with explanation of the various courses...the cherry on top was Kirk Westaway, Chef de Cuisine, stopping by the table to chit-chat at the end of meal...a most delightful and complete dining experience...highly recommend for foodies everywhere!!
5
Came back to try the six course surprise menu! Loved the very fresh majestic oyster and hand dived scallop with truffles! The mains, the halibut with sweetbreads and wagyu beef were awesome as always. The apple dessert was cute and a pleasant surprise. Will keep returning for the lovely ingredients, great cooking and friendly service
5
We had chef menu for lunch, every dishes were delicious.very impressed and satisfied. Will definitely visit again.

I have always wanted to visit Jaan the restaurant up above Swissotel The Stamford, Singapore where the panoramic view of Singapore is being captured like a post card in front of our eyes.Yes at last a date with hubby at Jaan makes me so exited because I am a foodie and I wish to taste the best from a Michelin Star restaurant having the gorgeous yet awesome culinary Chef Kirk Westaway. I finally tasted the best of the best artistic mouth watering food and being treated like a Queen the service is above excellent. I did not take a photo of the menu but I m sure when you visit Jaan you will be very excited questioning yourself what would be the next artistic dish. I must say to eat their delicious “Art” I can truly feel the passion of the Chef, the hardwork being put in to make every plate of their dish so attractive and tasty. Their cutleries, plates and bowls are all so unique. Infact I have more photos of their canapés and food that was served but I m allowed only to post 10 photos so I hope that you could eat with your eyes while seeing these photos I shared My hubby said every penny spent in Jaan is money worth. So don’t wait you must book a table soon to experience being pampered while enjoying an affordable 5 course meal at Jaan.

I chose this place for my birthday lunch. It's a one Michelin star restaurant situated on 70th floor with a spectacle view. We booked our reservation through the restaurant's website. I opted for the 5 course set lunch which cost $128++. I forgot to specify that I want a table by the window when making a reservation. Nevertheless, the table given to us was still able to see some view. The service was quite good. Food presentation was impressive though the portion was quite small for me. I wish for a larger portion. We were served with some warm bread with 2 types of French Bordier butters - unsalted and seaweeds. After that, we had 2 mini truffle macarons, crackers and warm cheesy balls. We had a bowl of soup. All these are not in the menu. I suppose they are called hors d'oeuvre. Then we were served the set lunch. At the end of the meal, I had to admit that I was bursting at the seams. Though the portions were small, they were filling. We had the pre-desserts and main desserts. I feel the main desserts is a bit of chocolate overdose. At the end of the meal, the restaurant gave us a complimentary chocolate mousse cake for my birthday. I am thankful for such nice gesture. Overall, I enjoyed my 2-hour birthday lunch tremendously.

We came here for my birthday dinner. View is absolutely stunning. Ask for the table by the window, it is a really amazing experience to see the whole Singapore at night from 70th floor. Interior is very cool, has this minimalistic, cold but cosy, modern feel. Service is at a very high level as in the other Michelin-starred restaurants but what makes it unique is the very attentive and personal approach, e.g. Chef himself leaving the kitchen and speaking to the guests is something we don't see too often (at least in Europe).And the most important part - food... absolutely brilliant! We went for 7-course menu, everything was perfect from amuse bouche or actually canapés ahead of it till the dessert. I should not give more details to leave some room for surprises but if you are a fan of a truffle and foie grass you will definitely fall in love with this menu. Really exceptional approach to food, various taste combinations and textures made it a special night

Had lunch on November 3rd with a business associate. The food was so-so for a Michelin-starred restaurant. This was not my first visit, making me wonder what has changed so drastically from my previous visits. Clearly Jaan needs to up its game.Of extreme annoyance was the constant reminders. Ever since I made a reservation for lunch I have received at least 4 email reminders (a couple requiring me to reply to re-confirm) and even a reminder via SMS. No restaurant worth its salt should go around irritating and annoying customers even before they set foot into the establishment.\Overall, a very anti-climatic experience and a letdown
4
A very nice evening, with close to perfect service, a very knowledgeable sommelier, - the set tasting menu was beautifully presented - but we did not remember the tastes of the dishes when we left the restaurant. We had a Tasmanian "champagne" Janz - accompanying the full menu - a great choice.
5
Situated on the 70th floor, we had a great view of the Marina Bay Sands, the Gardens by the Bay, the Singapore eye, the CBD, the estuary of Singapore river and the sea beyond. It’s the best place to view and know more about Singapore. The staff was polite, efficient and caring. Most importantly, we had one of the best food we have had. Service was prompt and the waiter patiently explained each dish that was served. For the price of S$130, it’s worth every cent. We will sure come back
5
Last night was a special anniversary meal for us. We were not let down by Jaan, the front of house staff were attentive and the food was amazing. We enjoyed every course but for me The Egg Within An Egg was the most beautifully presented and tasty course closely followed by the fish course. A lovely touch was for chef Kurt Westaway to come to meet us and check dietary requirements and even have a photo. Thank you Kurt for such amazing food - we will be back to visit Jaan the next time we are in Singapore. Plan a whole evening here - we started our evening with champagne at City Space, went on to eat the 7 course tasting menu at Jaan and finished the evening (into the early hours) at Bar Rouge. Brilliant!
1
Half full restaurant, way too expensive and from seven courses just one (scallops) with the Wow factor. Signature dish of eggs in an egg was swopped for a couple of dices of rooted celery. Wine was enough to wet your lips. Disappointing all over. Very sorry to say..
5
I wrote on Paste and Ledu in Bangkok over the weekend. Back in sunny Singapore, we topped off our wedding anniversary celebrations with a visit to Jaan. This is at the 70th floor of the Swisshotel so best is to request for a table by the window. You'll get fantastic night views of the Marina Bay Sands, Esplanade and Marina Square / Suntec City area. Formula1 fans should book now for the 2018 edition. As for the food, we opted for the 7 course menu. I think it is sufficient for a wonderful dining experience over 2.5 hours. I won't spoil the surprise but every dish was good. A little feedback to Jaan is that the time between courses could have been better. Highly recommended. Enjoy

This restaurant is old, but still great. Super Service. Great Food. A bit pricy, but nice experience.... Recommended... Beef was a let down.... Wagyu but too much of Marbling.... Dessert too was excellent.
Recommend.

Dinner is good and views is good. Maybe waiters were hard to understand what they serve and tends to get confused about bills. Gotta improve in your service.
5
What a fantastic lunch we had in Jaan, we arrived late at 1:40pm and ordered a 7 dishes menu. Food were all served well and beyond our expectations, creative and fun display with some surprised flavor combinations, seafood perfectly cooked and I love their dessert! For some of these Michelin places I've been they usually served couple different desserts or various but small bites of each in a plate, in Jaan, I had two proper desserts plus some sweets surprises as an ending. The view outside of window is another plus, astonished during the day it could only be more romantic after nightfall, we should probably come back for a dinner soon. (smile
5
There are surprises each time I return. Loved the new alaskan crab and pea panna cotta starter. That, to me, was the stand-out dish! The re-invented egg dish is delightful! I very much enjoyed the main courses as always. Chocolate espresso is excellent, but nothing beats last year's Ivory caramel!

Had dinner on a Thursday night (7 course degustation meal w/o alcohol = 300SGD per person). The view was great. Restaurant had too many tables; seemed like they were trying to squeeze in as many people as they could. Light could be dimmer for better ambience. Place was a little cold.The waiters and waitresses kept trying to up-sell us a lot of stuff. We were asked 5 times whether we wanted alcohol. Twice if we wanted coffee. There could be better co-ordination. Food was just ok, not mind-blowing. The snapper was not warm when it arrived
4
Had dinner on a Wednesday night. Had the 7-Course Degustation Meal. The person who paid and ordered wanted beef as the main, instead of pigeon. Do not know how much it cost.The restaurant is quite plain, other than the special light fittings. I suppose it's a blank canvas for the window view. Was surprised the dining room is that small and it's just like a "wedge" of a view, as it does not take up the whole floor. The meal was mostly good. The in-house baked bread was great! I only had problems with a few dishes. 1) the dish with "foam". I don't really go for it, and it was kind of tasteless, as I did not want the truffle broth (to me, truffle overwhelms the taste of ingredients), 2) I also did not like the egg dish. Not too sure what is the draw of this (my dining companion said he had a better version of this in RAW in Taipei) and 3) the snapper was quite tasteless.I asked a waiter to let me have the names of a few wines (we had wine pairing) and he forgot totally. I had to ask the Sommelier before leaving. Many couples celebrating. I think the restaurant could be a little "warmer" so that if feels cosier. Overall good for the experience, some dishes are inventive, and cooking skill is undoubtedly excellent, but doubt if I would want to go again
5
We have tried all of the 2 star Michelin restaurants in Singapore, and Jaan's performance was pretty close, but they also charge 2 star prices. We had the 7 course dinner menu with very good wine pairing, and it was one of the best meals we have had for some time. Excellent service and charming sommelier, and the food was delicious and creatively presented in a perfect setting. The view is one of the very best to see Singapore's impressive skyline, so try to book a table at the window. Highly Recommended, book in advance
5
This is a resturant for special occasion, as a 7-course dinner with wine pairing could easily set you back S$500 per head. On the 70th floor of Swissotel The Stamford, it is a perfect place to enjoy Singapore's breathtaking cityscape in the sunset or nightlight. The 40 seat resturant is intimate, yet well space out for privacy. The free form chandelier decoration is a nice art piece, making it modern non ostentatious. Service is warm, professional, non intrusive and consistent (this is our third visit). The quality of ingredient and selection of wine are refine. The chef has mastered his modern European cuisines' cooking technique yet preserved his own style and innovation. The aroma, flavour, texture, meticulousness in presentation and the spirit of striving for perfection are impressive.The 7-course exclude 4 amuse-bouche and include free coffee/tea and petit four. In the end four of us share one cheese plate, just for pleasure. Overall, we have a delightful celebration of my husband's birthday. PS they offer a delicious chocolate cake for the Birthday 'Boy' FOC, which we can opt to take away or enjoy on the spot. What a classy touch

We took a client here one night on a business trip and we definitely impressed them. He lived in Singapore and always wanted to go.The view really is incredible, the food was absolutely fantastic (although we thought there was a lot of truffle in it), I didn't mind so much but one of our party found it too much.We did have a great time, it is not a noisy restaurant so best not for a loud group but beware it is really expensive! We had some bill shock 
5
Definitely one of the best gastronomic meals I've had in Singapore - I won't bother commenting on each dish as they will change the menu on a seasonal basis and they did such a great job at matching flavours that I'm convinced the chef as the talent to do it with any ingredient. What truly adds an incredible dimension to the meal is the breathtaking view of the Singapore Marina Bay. Please book early enough to secure a window seat, especially if you are bringing a special guest - a great venue to propose or ask for forgiveness..
4
We ordered the 7-course french cuisine from the dinner menu and the serving portions were right, the food tasted excellent and fresh. The best was the foie gras, tender and delicate. Must try if you visit this restaurant with great view of Singapore.
5
We went to Jaan for a lunch during our honeymoon and got an amazing experience. The food is exquisit, the view like a dream and the service perfect. We could not recommend this restaurant more!
Thank you for a memorable experience!
5
What can I say... food, service and location are great.
Yes maybe expensive but for what you get I think it is good value.
4
We have dined at Jaan on numerous occasions, and the food is consistently good. My personal take is this restaurant is better at lunch than at dinner, reason being the view is better at lunch time. Book early and request a window table to truly enjoy looking out to Marina Bay Sands, the Esplanade etc. The young men in our party were particularly excited that they can have an ariel view of the F1 track.Service was superb, attentive and not overbearing, willing to accommodate special requests, and getting it right. This latest meal was a wedding anniversary lunch and the restaurant provided a complementary cake. As we were so full at the end of the meal, the waiter offered to pack it for us to take away. A nice gesture without us asking.Food, beautifully presented and very subtle tastes. We especially liked the palate cleanser which was visually complex and tasted lovely. I do not want to give too much description to spoil the surprise, suffice to say we had not seen something similar in all the fancy meals we have had around the world.I am taking points away for the main course of wagyu beef - a huge disappointment. It was sous-vide and to me that was cheating on a good piece of meat. I could not even tell if it was really a piece of wagyu as there was not fat remaining on the beef and it was cooked till tender. Could have been any cheap piece of meat with no taste except from the sauce. Dessert was nice but not outstanding.Overall, worth going to. At the end of the meal our family compared notes and we decided Jaan still wins over Les Amis by a nose, because of the view, as the best French restaurant in Singapore
4
Great view, we sat by the window facing the marina bay area. Great food and wine pairing as well. We found the food inventive and playful, the tomato and beetroot dishes especially since they are vegetarian but still very satisfying. The egg and bacon dish was undoubtedly the best "breakfast" we had in Singapore. The Kobe was amazing! According to the chef it takes 4 days to prepare it, so that could be the explanation.. Deserts were light and delicious as well. My only negative remark is that the amount of wine was less then we are accustomed to so we kind of ran out of wine at the end, and a little generosity at this point would have made a big difference, without costing much.Price wise it's pricey - of course! All in all a very pleasant dining experience!
5
Ate here on Tuesday evening (25/07). We decided to go for the 7 course degustation menu. It was sublime, every course had something special, and it was evident from the start the kitchen has serious talent. Delighted to kick off with Irish oysters too.I was a little worried that this might be a restaurant relying on its location / setting as a reason to its success. If this restaurant was in a miserable basement somewhere, it would still be getting five stars from me. Everything had a touch of class, and luckily for us, the table by the window just added to the special evening for us.Favourite course for me was probably the cheese.The waiting team were professional, but personal, and we enjoyed that we could chat with them and just chill.Yes it's pricey, but was it good value for money? Yes, it was some of the best money I have ever spent
3
Celebrate my friend's birthday and we book dinner table more than a month ago. First of all, the restaurant is located at city center, at shopping mall and also part of hotel. There is no complementary parking at all. If the restaurant is located on the street, I won't ask for it, but it is within hotel area/shopping mall!After we didn't order champagne, no one asked us for wine/drink until first pre meal appetizer is on the table. The whole sequence is wrong and no offer of wine menu. When they send the birthday cake, they do not offer to take any photo for us. Obviously there is a huge gap of the services. We have been to many Michelin Star restaurant local and overseas, everything the restaurant will surprise us with a 'woah'. This is the only time, we don't feel anything special about the food, service. The only plus point is the view. We will not come back or recommend it to our friends. Disappointed.
5
We enjoyed the fabulous special lunch with Chef Bombana - amazing food. Watch out for the 'walk in wardrobe' like magical box of petit fours! Really special. The only downside for us was being pressure for a pre lunch drink of champagne when our lunch already included champagne (as we did the wine pairing). Getting stung for $60 a glass was abit much
3
I suspect this is the place you go when you want to appear you've made it. It will cost you though and the food is not that great. This place which we are told has a Michelin star has a great view and most of the other clients that evening appeared to be rather tarty women looking at their smartphones. There are only very expensive menus with no choice and the dishes a succession of highly mixed up tastes. The best part is the variety of crockery in which the food is served up. Not a best restaurant experience by a long way
5
From the moment you arrive and are presented with an impressive selection of Krug by the glass to the quality of the location, food and service you feel like you've died and gone to foodies heaven.The presentation and taste of each of the courses is unique and amazing.On the very expensive side of things but defiantly a worthwhile experience
4
The view was stunning and the atmosphere was very peaceful, we really enjoyed our 5 course lunch! The presentation was spotless.
Even though it was a 5 course meal, it was actually a 6 or 7 course with all of the complimentary dishes
5
Who am I to judge the food when Michelin Guide has clearly done a great job. In addition the amazing view from the 70th floor really is breath-taking. All this combined with top notch service, I warmly recommend Jaan to be experienced.
3
Ambience and service was super, but was disappointed with the food, portion was too small. Nothing much to shout about.
5
Awesome food and service. Loved the Crab and Lamb dishes. Very friendly staff, warm and welcoming. Sham I didnt get to meet chef. Maybe next time
5
Best french food in singapore. We visit here twice a year and price are reasonable than other fine dining french restaurant.
5
The lunch was a multiple birthday celebration and it certainly was a birthday to remember. had the chef's surprise 6 course degustation menu. Each new dish was a delight for the eyes as well as the taste buds. Originally we booked for dinner but plans had to be changed so we had lunch instead, which I enjoyed more because of the view.
4
When booking we were told there window tables have all been taken but on arrival we were pleasantly surprised that the restaurant had given us perhaps the best window tables in the house! Having a direct view of Marina Bay Sands Ferries wheel and the sea. Somehow this has created a very conducive mood for fine dining and drinking! I had the 4 course business lunch with wines. The food were fabulous and the wines were agreeable.Only grouse if at all is the limited selection of bread - only one variety served!! A 3-star Michelin restaurant in Hong Kong has 13 gorgeous types of bread. Being 1-star, perhaps the addition of 2 more types of bread will provide customers with an even more satisfying experience.Food: 4/5View (table by window): 5/5Wines: 3/5
5
Went to JAAN to celebrate my wife's birthday. We were seated on a window table, with sweeping views of the marina. For the first few mins, we just gazed outside!We had 5-course meal with 3-flights of wine pairing. The amouse bouche was pretty looking bites which tasted quite nice. The mushroom soup was remarkable. Then followed some sour-dough bread with butter, appetizer and mains. The plating was quite expertly done.My favorite dish was the baby pork with aubergine. Egg with bacon was outstanding as well. My wife loved the espresso dessert. There wasn't much theatre (foam, liquid nitrogen etc) and I quite liked it that way. The food spoke for itself. Service was pleasant and unpretentious. It was a memorable birthday lunch for my wife 
3
Came back here for business dinner and while the dining room has finally been upgraded, it is still lack of "soul", very meeting room-alike.Service is tip top, wine pairing was nice. Food wise, we are still not blown away. Food was cooked to perfection but lack of "soul" and creativity and link among ingredients. Dessert was boring and we had two out of three same petit four than last year
5
Sitting on the 70th floor of the Swissotel in Singapore,and having an amazing meal,..I need to pinch myself ,as I think that I have died and gone to heaven.On a recent trip to Singapore,my wife and I had the pleasure of dining at this restaurant ,with a 6 course degustation menu with matching wines.Needless to say,every small course was magnificent,and the way the food was presented ,I almost felt guilty disturbing the chefs magnificent creations.The imagination that has gone into the food is astounding,and the matching wines were perfect to compliment the food.Bravo,we will be back on our next trip to Singapore
5
Great food, excellent view, and nice service! It's an awesome experience and a perfect ending for my trip.
5
Excellent fine dining with fantastic views. Service was also very good with some great wine recommendations.
5
Truly excellent dining experience with extraordinary attention to detail from committed staff in an amazing location. What's not to love?
5
Rising high above Singapore, this is a very special restaurant run by one of the younger generation chiefs that are being drawn to this city. Multi-course with each surprising your taste buds. Impeccable service, wine selections completed a fabulous meal.
5
I travel a lot and have eaten and generally only eat at fine dining establishments and this restaurant was one of the best I have eaten at. The variety of taste sensations and presentation of food is second to none.
3
Visited Jaan for a business lunch with some colleagues and was only given the option of 5-course set the moment we were seated. when we asked for the 4-course instead, the waitress was clearly not very pleased and took only 1 menu for the entire group. so basically most of us had no idea what we were having until the course was served. We were served some free starter without any idea what we were eating too. Food was great of course, it's afterall Michelin 1-star restaurant. Every course was an art itself. I don't take lamb and was able to change the main to beef instead. Worthy of the price tag or not? With the lack of sincerity in their service, I would rather give it a miss the next time
4
The most spectacular views of Singapore was definitely factor “wow”! Degustation is “on-trend” everywhere with star rated restaurants. We are lucky enough to a try a number in Australia, UK and Singapore. Palettes are obviously individual therefore you are going to have your favourite flavours; my husband likes dishes to be rich indulgent whereas I tend to like a combination of light and fresh. Often degustations are either carnivore / protein (Jaan offers oyster, pork, shellfish, pigeon) …or… vegetarian. There has only been one other degustation historically offered the perfect balance in 12 courses of protein vs vegetarian.This is micheln Star Decadent, Rich and be ready to indulge eg: I could only describe it as eating one chocolate cake, after another chocolate cake, after another chocolate dessert - however a little on the earthy side for my palette. Even the intriguing Heirloom Tomato was quite heavy. A series of dishes you will find one or two that suits your taste. I would have to agree with other reviews, beautifully plated and execution - but somehow not wowza for every dish. Don’t get me wrong, it’s all super food. That’s a personal feeling, but after dish 5 - I welcomed the fresh Amalfi Lemon palette cleanser, as I was feeling overwhealmed with the decadent, rich earthy protein dishes. I want to be able to keep going to the end, and not feel I have to leave part of the journey on the plate, in order to survive the taste adventure and get to the finishing line!Sometimes I would rather have one good main dish (then be enticed back with something else on the menu), rather than have lots of dishes where some are either a hit or miss. It’s a shame this restaurant doesn't offer an ala’carte option too. Alongside Michelin star food, expect Michelin star service - all the team have had outstanding training and exceed expectations.Despite my own personal comments about layers of food, it was also about the company and the event and we had a really lovely evening
4
Very pleasure at the beginning 30mins. Then every plates are very rush. Once I put down the they come to collect the plate even my hubby have not finished. I chose wine pairing. Each glass of wine is less then standard size. Surprised us, there is a fly in the restaurant ！finally is tea... just asked is coffee or tea. But not ask what kind of tea！we believe they are rushing because at that moment is 1030pm already. Rather than this. The food is very good. Beautiful presentation and delicious.
5
From the 75th floor, you will see all of Singapore - if you make sure to book a table by the window. The restaurant set-up is a little impersonal and dark at night.Food and service are sophisticated and of very good quality ; for those who like to read and taste there is a beautiful wine list ; the one star rating is adequate in my opinion.Clearly a risk-free option for a special occasion
3
It should come without surprise that one of the comments would be that Odette and Jaan are similar in their offerings to diners. 1) Service staff were excellent and contacted us twice to make sure that our reservation was confirmed and in place. Offered a birthday cake at the end of night.$130 for 2 glasses of Krug $80 for 2 glasses of rioja We ordered $298 per person for the 10 signature course. 3) While we liked the glass sculptures crossing the ceilings, the restaurant for us felt like something was lacking. For example, the wall on between the windows with the spotlight shining on it seemed like there was supposed to be something hanging there but decorators did not know what to put there. FOOD4) While the use of Basil is indeed refreshing in several of the dishes, others such as the truffle broth is something that is frequently served in other restaurants of similar standards. That dish did not particularly excite us. 5) The sous vide egg, unfortunately, Odette wins this one in comparison. The sous vide egg of Jaan has too much going on that does take away some of the flavours of the original subject. 6) We felt there were too many desserts on the menu of 10 signatures. As much as it had a lovely refined texture, the epoisses served did not have much taste as what is normal of the cheese's namesake. And then followed by 2 more dishes of sorbet; one served with wild strawberries. We would've been happy to just have the one with wild strawberries. The other sorbet did not really seem to be a signature dish to us.This was a birthday dinner surprise for my husband but we were somewhat upset at the end of the night with the bill as were our neighbours; a few couples who were also visibly disturbed by the bill. All in all, it was abit of a let-down unfortunately
4
Great view and superb food presented from a Michelin Chef. Everything in perfect order.
Amazing dinner in a great atmosphere.

My wife and I had a wonderful time for a birthday celebration at Jaan. It is tastefully decorated and has one of the best views in town.The view was spectacular boasting a panoramic view of Singapore; it added to the dining experience. We had a window seat facing the East Coast of Singapore; we would recommend to arrive before 7pm to watch the city as it moves into the night. It's a memorable experience.The degustation was arranged and prepared thoughtfully and the wine list was impressive. We enjoyed the conversations with our sommelier, who was knowledgeable and generous in sharing experience and insight.This is an intimate 40-seat restaurant and spaces between each table was generous to allow privacy.We had a lovely evening

Visited Jaan to celebrate a birthday whilst in Singapore for a few days. We had the 7 course tasting menu along with the accompanying wine flight. Expensive but worth it.The view from the 70th floor over Marina Bay is great, especially if the evening light show is on during your meal.Our only negative comment is that the atmosphere in the restaraunt was a little sterile

We were out for my son's 25th birthday to this french restaurant. The ambience was excellent. The food was different but very delicious. The presentation was awesome.View was superb from the restaurant.Birthday boy received a complimentary chocolate cake and desserts were extremely good. No words could describe.... The price could be considered for review as we find it to be too pricey. Besides that, everything was good including the service was excellent
5
There is nothing to criticize on the experience . Welcome food and service is at top level.The Chef has created for this season a fantastic menu. The easiest dish "Heirloom Tomatoe" is also so the most complex and difficult to actually do. Amazing taste and complexity! All dishes are great and sure worth to try and to talk about. The fresh ingredients, the different texture within a dish shows the sense of innovation and creativity the chef has . Chef, well done! Service, very good and at all times very attentive and friendly. From arriviste to the departure. The only point one could open an argument is the wine pairing. Maybe personal but I would have expected more creativity to ensure the experience of innovation is at the same level between food and wine. Again, not a critic but we could argue about it and am sure the Sommelier has his point and reasons
5
it is always a memorable and awesome moment at Jaan. Start with the amazing view from the 70th floor. then the service is seamless and down to every details. and of course the magic of the culinary presentation in every dish.My 3rd time at Jaan and every time a new gastronomic experience

We came here for lunch and was lucky to get a window table as I had booked 3 months in advance and alerted that it was my wife's birthday. We ordered the 4 course and 6 course options. Food was good as can be expected for a 1 star Michelin restaurant but the service was a bit average. Drinks were incredibly expensive so we ended up with mineral water. We were presented with a cake at the end of our meal but missed out on the petit fours which seemed to be served to the other tables. Was nice to have tried the restaurant. Alaskan king crab and heirloom tomatoes were the stand out dishes.
3
Being 1 Michelin we came with high expectation. JAAN was not offering anything surprising, food was good, every single meat / fish cooked to perfection, but there is really nothing else, we were waiting for more.. a flair of creativity, something that makes us want to go back, not just a pretty plating. The restaurant itself is really falling behind of its league in term of atmosphere / decoration / feeling. We felt like dining in the meeting room whereas we were "lucky" to have better seat in the house. It was very monotone and dated

This restaurant had many qualities to be the best restaurant. Perfect view of the bay, beautifully presented food that are so well-cooked. Not too many tables so staff can easily be more attentive.Personally I expected the lamb to be more tender and the fat to be more rendered. Also the chocolate dessert to be balanced out with something more citrus as there were so many sweet components. But that's just my preference. I was not impressed with the service. It's like something I'd get from any basic restaurants anywhere, was not happy I had to pay 10% service for the kind of service I received. It wasn't horrible, just not something I'd expected from a fine dining place. The girls with name tags are nice though they seem inexperienced, the two I dealt with who wear the red pins and no name tags are abrupt and somewhat rude. They come across as managers or someone who run the place but they shouldn't act like they are my manager too. Quite stuck-up. 5 stars for view and location, 4-4.5 for food and 1-2 stars for service. But that's just my humble opinion
5
The setting, food and service are simply faultless. We were in a party of 8 with different preferences and dietary requirements. All accommodated beyond what would be expected even at the restaurant of this class. The choice of wine is divine. The service was attentive without being overbearing. It's a must when visiting Singapore. There is not a single detail that is overlooked at this stunning place
5
Michelin star and well worth it. Every course combined Flavours and textures. The chocolate desert was amazing as was the pidgeon and tomato dishes. Others were good as well! Better than other high end places in Singapore!
5
We heard about Jaan restaurant so my wife and I arranged to have lunch yesterday. Truly an experience to remember. We had the 4 courses with matching wine that was really 6 courses with all the extras. We couldn't decide which course we enjoyed most they were all perfect. But I have to make special mention of the basil flavoured sorbet. Only regret is that I did not make a note of the dessert wine.Extra treat when Kirk came out to speak to us
5
Wonderful visit with a fantastic view of Singapore. The food was intricate in terms of flavour, texture and presentation. Every dish was bursting with a variety of flavours. One of my most memorable restaurants in terms of food and flavour. The tomato dish (which I understand takes 24-36 hours to make) was exceptional. Would love to take my other half for a special outing here
5
This place is on the 70th floor of the Swisshotel facing the harbor and at night Singapore does a light show. What a wonderful venue for a great meal. Chef Kirk Westaway came by to greet us. We had the seven course tasting menu: maple cured trout,tomato burrata, eggs and bacon, foie gras with pear, snapper, wagyui beef and lemon lime sorbet. Our sommelier was from Barcelona. When we were there for the Olympics he was four years old. Very nice visit and fabulous dinner
5
I recently had lunch at Jaan with some friends. Everything from the decor and view to the service and food makes it a great experience. The restaurant truly deserves the michelin stars. We picked the four course set lunch at $88 and a bottle of wine. Everything from the word go was fantastic
5
Lunch on high. High floor. High expectations. We left on a high. It really is wonderful when you have read a lot about somewhere and it exceeds your expectations. I was treated to a birthday lunch including a glass of Krug and a divine Chablis to accompany the degustation. We loved every course, from the amuse bouche to the desserts. The staff were efficient and professional, warm and friendly. Chef Kirk Westaway visited us and other tables. Truly a special experience

In a 1 star Michelin restaurant at that rice range I would honestly expect a more holistic experience. Not only the food needs to be great, but also the visual experience and the ambiance in the restaurant is important. So if a restaurant charges big money I also expect an all-round experience. That we didn't get.The food was awesome - even impeccable. The service was good, but there were a few unnecessary hick-ups that shouldn't be.All the dishes we had were small pieces of art work. Beautifully served, a lot of imagination and equally great taste. Just as we expected!I had a few reflections during the evening.The first is the surprise menu (10 courses). The staff didn't/couldn't share the content of the 10 courses. It was supposedly something the chef makes up on the day. That sounded fun and adventurous, but made picking the right wine a little bit difficult.What was then a little strange was that we each received a written menu after two courses?? Weird when we were told that it was more or less randomly generated by the kitchen according to the day. Maybe even more surprised when 3 of the 10 courses indicated on the written menu were not the ones being served. Not impressed! We were also asked before ordering if there as anything we didn't eat so the chef could avoid that in the surprise menu. We very clearly said no cheese and were surprised when one of the 10 dishes was cheese anyway? Despite the food being great I most say that to me the surroundings are also important. It is part of the grand scheme of a restaurant. The total experience. I have seldom been in a less inspiring restaurant setting when it comes to the interior decorating. Simply dull. Luckily there is a great view.So go for the food, not the total experience
5
I can't well express well enough how impressive this restaurant is in terms of food, wine choices, ambience, view, service and location. I celebrated my Husband birthday here and we left with fond good memories. Of course apart from having a great company (that is, my hub), all the works in the restaurant played a large part. We had the mystery 7 course meal and the wine pairing of 7. Each dish is well executed in terms of flavour combination using sometimes the simplest ingredient like heirloom tomato and egg. My hub and I agreed that this restaurant deserves higher rating than 1 star Michelin anytime, beating another French restaurant of 2 stars easily. This place comes highly recommended by me.
5
This is definitely a "wow" experience - the location stunning; the service superb and the food leaves you speechless (for those that know me, this is impressive!).My gorgeous husband took me to Jaan for a special evening and it did not disappoint. We had been wanting to go for some time, but never got around to it.The degustation menu was divine. We decided to choose our own wine instead of pairing. Every single dish was an experience in culinary wonder, discreetly explained by the wonderfully professional staff.You were aware there were other people in the restaurant initially, but the spacing of the tables allowed this to quickly fade to the background. We had the pleasure of a table right on the window, and the view was breathtaking.There was not one part of our evening that was out of sync. It was perfect
5
Overwhelmingly beautiful treat at Jaan, Chief Kirk Westaway blow us away with his modern french cuisine. It's really an art to display the food in such a stunning way and still taste delicious. From the amuse bouche to the food and dessert, every dishes impressively consistent in quality too. One of those special places you have to try at least once
5
Amazing food with perfect presentation..the chief is genius all dishes taste and they surprised us with every thing every dishe is better than before the simplest thing I can say is fantastic restaurant with amazing view ever
5
When going out to dinner on Valentine's Day one would expect dull uninspired fare served without enthusiasm and at an inflated cost. Not so at Jaan! Although you will spend a pretty penny especially compared to the wonderful Hawker stalls available throughout Singapore but hey this is fine dining at its best. From the service to the food to the personal visit from the Chef, everything was impeccable. The menu was diverse and inspired as well as generous in terms of fantastic ingredients and diversity. Each dish was a treat and left you excited for the next course. The pre dinner "snacks" blew us away and went far beyond your usual amuse bouchÃ©. Wine pairing was perfect and service was the perfect blend of professionalism and familiarity. If you truly enjoy fine dining at its best do not miss Jaan
4
A wonderfully scenic location (51st floor of the Swissotel) and awesome French cuisine. Loved every bit of it, and my wife was impressed on her birthday. Lovely collection of wines as well. Recommend to sit close to the window to savour the sights with the food or a glass of wine
5
Booked at the last minute and were blown away. This was a magnificent experience from the first greeting, through the really inventive and delicious amuses, to each course on the tasting menu. The chef is clearly on top of his game, and each dish was impressively consistent in quality and innovation. The view was impressive as well, but nothing compared to the food. The service was excellent, and the sommelier was extremely knowledgeable and friendly. Can't recommend this too highly
5
A delicious meal from the beginning to the end. Each dish has its touch of finesse on the palate.A delight you can enjoy gently and slowly for fear that the plate is empty too quickly.I can only congratulate the Chief Kirk Westaway, who has managed to enhance each of his dishes and regale us.From the top of its 70 floors, the restaurant offers us an overview and beautiful of Singapore night. The setting is idyllic for a dinner for two or in friends.Thanks to the Chief Kirk Westaway for the delicacy of his kitchen, for his kindness and gentleness, the sentiments found in its dishes.Congratulations to the staff which was very attentive and friendly with the customers.I would add to finish it was a long time that I had not seen people dinner without being at 90% of the time with their smartphone as a Communicator

This visit was our second at Jaan and obviously we thought about it highly enough the first time to think it is worth a return visit. Unfortunately within a year it seems that both the kitchen and floor staff was changed and certainly not for the better (in my opinion).From the very beginning the service was quite hesitant, we had to wait quite long, matter of fact after we already finished the amouse bouche before we were able to acquire (after asking for it) the wine list. Then the courses just kept on coming, almost without any break in between. I had to ask for the manager to ask her to please slow the serving of the courses - felt like that the kitchen wanted to get rid of the guests as soon as possible. My wife's vegetarian tasting menu (as she said) was nothing to write home about, nothing special or interesting. I can also say practically the same for my tasting menu, except it was the 'meaty' version, in which I actually left the pigeon after one bite as it was so severely undercooked that it practically (not really!) still spurted blood... The service (again) was so unprofessional that my wife actually had to catch a waiter to fill up our wine glasses. All of this in most restaurant would just sound like carping, but when the three of us (wife, daughter & me) paid more than S$1,100 one do want everything to work as well to have a seamless & professional service. (I was told to mention though that the final sweet, the chocolate dish on the other hand was excellent; also that if one would like to enjoy really excellent vegetarian food, one must try Tian in Vienna, Austria). Anyhow, one thing for sure - after all this I appreciated the street food of Singapore and the one Michelin starred Hainan Chicken Rice at the food market (for S$5) even more..
5
The courses start out small and you wondering if you will have a full meal. After all seven courses we were completely full and our senses were astonished. The sauces that accompany many of the dishes are pure works of art. One of the best dining experiences I've ever had. The wine pairings perfectly matched each dish the poqures were ample. The meal lasted 3 hours but it seemed like much less as everything was well-paced and timed perfectly. If the price fits your 0budget this is a must do in Singapore

I went to Jaan on my birthday with a few friends, the place is very coast and intimate and the views are amazing. However the highlight of the night was the food! We opted for a 9 course tasting and even though there were a few dietary restrictions at the table they happily manage to accommodate every single request. We started with a few amuse bouch which were exceptionally well presented, a bit of molecular gastronomy looking, nevertheless delicious and fun to experience. Personally I am not a fan of Oysters however the one they served here was very well balanced and light with a touch if caviar and artichoke mouse, the scallop was one of the best I had, perfectly cooked and paired with a touch of shellfish broth and the desserts were just to die for. Kudos to the team for creating such works of art and marrying so many flavours yet maintaining a perfect balance. Not too mention the fact that the chef would come out and engage with every single table along the course of the dinner ensuring every guest in the restaurant is well taken care of.Many thanks to the team you have made my birthday dinner memorable
5
I can't forget this evening at jaan restaurant in Singapour! I went to so many Michelin star restaurants all over Europe,but this one is one of the best I have been to! The view is amazing, the waiters very professional but the best thing was chef Bart who came to the table to introduce part of our dishes! The food was amazing, the tomatoes and burrata with basil sorbet, the pigeon,and the slow cooked egg were delicious! Chef Bart is a nice person, and thanks to him my dinner was unforgettable! I recommend to anyone had the possibility to go there...Simply amazing!

I had just got off the plane in the morning and felt a little rushed to the lunch. The view was absolutely stunning. I am a sucker for views and the Krug was not so bad either. the service was great and I was impressed that as the patrons who sat by the windows leave, they move the other patrons to close by the windows so that they can enjoy the view. The food was ok. I feel that they lack originality. The chef was friendly. He came and did his rounds with the restaurant patrons as the dessert was served. I think the value for money is reasonable. I was expecting slightly higher level of the quality of the food as there was so much write up about it
5
I enjoy all the added dishes which make your experience even more spectacular.
I recommend to book in advance to make sure you have a table by the window.
the staff is just perfect
great experience

This is a restaurant that competes with the best in the world. Falling into a fiercely competitive Uber restaurant category that has it's mainstays with 14 course dinners, finest ingredients, best service, culinary technique and as a result high prices. The restaurants I can compare it to are Alinea and True from Chicago and although it was the most expensive dinner my wife and I have ever had it could not measure up to these giants of culinary excellence. Don't get me wrong, it's still an amazing place, so let me start with what I liked.It holds a breath-taking view at the top of the Singapore Swiss Otel. From this lofty perch it commands a view of the surrounding city as well as Marina bay. The ceiling has glass plates resembling mother of pearl giving you the impression there is a sort of origami clam shell floating above you. Both food and drinks have a wow factor. I got a sort of egg white, apricot Bellini with the most delightful hard whipped foam on top. Food taste was excellent, using the best ingredients in the most delightful combinations. Some dishes had excellent presentation namely the amuse bouche was perhaps one of the largest and best presentations I've had. It came on a mix of holders; some rock, others bamboo and had a sauce you would eat out of a stylized can.Another favorite presentation was when we received a carton of eggs opened up, with dry ice billowing a fog below it. The egg was deposited by our waiter onto the top of a delicious soup.All I've said so far is amazing so why 3 stars? Indeed it's not in the piece by piece breakdown but in the comparison to other cream of the crop restaurants that brings it down.- I think back to Alinea where I ate a fruit leather balloon or had a decadently filled Chocolate urn shattered onto my waterproof tablecloth. Those were wow moments, I never even imagined food could be served like this, Jaan did not offer surprises of this level. - Dinner prices are the equivalent of an intercontinental flight. A meal at this price is one you don't just hope to remember, you need to remember it. One way of facilitating this is through a printout you can take of the menu. I've gotten these each time, even embossed with my name on them. It's not that I'm going to frame the thing but it can certainly help me remember the experience fondly.- When the cheese tray rolled around as one of the last items I thought to myself well I'm pretty full already but heck this is probably some grade A amazing cheese and I've already paid for it. I was half right; although we had some smelly flavorful cheeses elegantly served they were not included in our chef's tasting menu. I'm a bit upset that I was served cheese costing 140 without anyone bothering to inform me it was not included; I had that expectation from other fine dining restaurants that had included it. I would have certainly denied it to fill up on more of what was to come if I had known. All in all the food was great in taste but presentation that was not up to par with other uber restaurants and not being told about the extra costs set this experience back for me
1
First the easy stuff: Service was alright, music a bit too loud. More importantly : Food was disappointing. Party of 4, one had vegetarian option. Overall impression : very ordinary and soul-less for SGD125 per head! The sequence of the dishes seems like Odette but the taste is soul-less and doesn't blend well. It doesn't really taste French cuisine to be honest. The vegetarian option was a real ripoff - just a few pieces of vegetables - thats it! Mom was real upset about that - zero imagination. We been to Jaan many times over the almost last 8years but this is the worst ever experience. Will never go back again
3
We booked this night as a special treat for our family living in Singapore. The food was superb and no hesitation in recommending it. However the evening got off to a bad start over pre dinner drinks. Apparently you are ReQuired to order Krug if you dine here. We asked for 2 beers and 2 gin and tonics. We waited over 20 minutes and our degustation had started. I had to remind the staff to bring it which meant our timing with food and wine were out. This should NOT happen at a restaurant of this calibre. It's great that Krug has an ambassador restaurant but it should not be at the expense of the overall experience
5
So so glad we came to Jaan.The food is spectacular. The 5 course degustation was so perfect- it all tasted amazing and we left feeling so content and happy! It really is an experience - one we highly recommend and the views from the 70th floor are amazing
4
We had dinner here with a friend visiting from overseas. The table we had afforded us fantastic views of the city. As it is all tasting menu, the job of choosing what to eat is easy. We had the normal menu and vege menu at our table. Service was attentive and professional. Dishes were explained well as they were served. Breads were great. The starter snacks were varied and delicious. We enjoyed the theatrics of the presentations, and the finesse of the dishes, and most were proclaimed by my dining companions as delicious. Overall, we enjoyed our evening a lot and this is a great place for a celebration. However, it is rather expensive so not one for a regular experience
2
Service was robotic . Limited smiles , despite Christmas and birthday celebration . Birthday cake put on table ... no greeting I actually had to ask for a knife To cut the cake !!Many better choices on our sunny island .Jaan ... sorry ... you were a hefty disappointment .
5
I like to eat in very fine and Michelin starred restaurants few times a year. Of course, when you talk about such restaurants, the average Tripadvisor scale is not really applicable because it is certainly way above the average food. The food is remarkable and I believe the Chef has good potential for a 2nd star in the near future. The view and atmosphere are fantastic. But based on my other experiences with other Michelin starred restaurants around the world (1, 2, or 3 stars), I strongly believe Jaan is overpriced for "just 1 Michelin star". For this reason, I won't go back to Jaan and would rather go to some 2 Michelin stars restaurants in Singapore that are very reputable in the same budget range
5
You need to book in advance, particularly if you want a window table, and who wouldn't given the spectacular views of the city you get from being on the 70th floor of the Swissotel. It's a relatively small (40 seat) and intimate restaurant - perfect for a romantic or special occasion. Was a little surprised that they needed to check my credit rating when I was making the booking but given the prices I can understand why. We went with the $238/head seven course degustation menu but instead of the $190/head wine paring decided on a nice bottle of Australian white from their extensive 250+ wine line list. Having read up previous reviews about JAAN we declined the offer of Krug champagne when first seated, which you get the impression is complimentary but at $80/glass or $1,000/bottle is certainly not. Shortly after settling ourselves in for the night we were greeted with a delightful collection of canapés (Wagyu beef tartare, reconstructed fish & chips, and foie gras & truffle macarons served on driftwood) followed by a glass of potato soup with black truffle bouillons and then a collection of assorted bread rolls all before our first course arrived. The service was informative and unobtrusive- we never felt that we were being rushed or that we weren't being attended to.Each course was a sensory delight, the colour, the presentation, the aroma, the texture and the flavours clearly reflected the attention and expertise of amazing culinary staff. The highlights, of which there were many, included the heirloom tomato collection, the rosemary infused smoked egg (delicately poached at a precise 64 degrees celcius for 55 minutes - the theatrics of serving have to been seen rather than described) and forest pigeon. Whilst the mains excelled in terms of taste and presentation, the desserts were the pièce de résistance. We opted for the cheese selection first (an extra $35) but then I'm a sucker for cheese. The amuse bouche which was delightfully cleansing, the chocolate mousse with hot chocolate espuma was amazing. We then finished with a selection of mignardises and tea. Having absolutely no room left for a single morsel of food they then served a small birthday cake - which made my day however we were so grateful that they offered to box it up and let us take it home, otherwise I think I would have burst at my seams.JAAN and chef Kirk Westway thoroughly deserve their Michelin star - the meal was an epiculinary masterpiece.

I believe the title says it all for this fine dining establishment. Jaan restaurant located in the top floors of Swisotel Hotel. I visited them for its degustation lunch. The presentation was perfect, service was top notch, and the value was also very good considering all these combined factors.Oh and did i mention the view.? You can get all the city icons in one frame from your dining table (Marina Bay Sands, Garden by the Bay, Singapore Flyer). They only have several window tables so please ensure to book well in advance to get these tables

We were impressed with the 7 course tasting menu. Almost all the courses were excellent. The only one we did not care for at all was the Wagyu beef- had a lot of fat and was too rich for our palate. Presentation of the slow cooked eggs was very theatric. Favorites were the tomato within tomato dish, and chocolate 5-ways dessert. Note, not all tables have a good view. Window tables are much better than others. One thing that left a very bad impression on us was the champagne drink which is very underhanded in the way they present it. Almost immediately after you are seated they bring over a cart of Krug champagne asking if you want a drink. At this point you have no menu (drinks or otherwise) and they don't tell you the price. I knew the 7 course meal was ~$300 and so supposed ~$50 would be reasonable for glass of champagne. Image my shock when I later received a drinks menu and saw the champagne was >$100! I think they way they handle this is poor. They clearly try to push the Krug on people and create an awkward moment when you really don't know what you are getting into. Either give people a menu and a minute to decide on drinks, or tell them the price. I saw other couple struggle with this awkward presentation.I go to a restaurant of this calibre for the overall experience and in this case I left feeling taken advantage of. I realize you are the ambassador of Krug, but don't push it on people...
5
This was only the second time I've been to a Michelin starred restaurant, and I had high expectations. On the food front, they were met and blown out of the water. The seven course degustation menu was inspired, a sensory journey of taste, aroma, texture, and visual perfection.All the courses were wonderful, with the heirloom tomatoes, hens' egg, and the chocolate dessert being particular favorites. Each course was perfectly matched with the wine, and my wife's request for only white wine was accommodated without fuss, and with a couple of excellent choices in place of the two reds.The service though, really let the meal down. The first three courses turned up so fast I hadn't finished the previous one, leaving us feeling pressured rather than relaxed and able to enjoy the food. We asked if they could please slow down and leave a bit of a gap between courses, and then a few minutes later my wife was asked if she was feeling better yet. Perhaps this is a cultural thing, but telling your customers there must be something wrong with them if they don't want to wolf down the food as fast as possible is not the kind of service I expect from a Michelin starred restaurant. One of the latter courses came so quickly it caught out the sommelier, so we ended up waiting a few minutes for the matching wine to arrive.I've given JAAN five stars because the food was simply amazing, but a restaurant with pretensions to greatness needs to get its service fixed
5
Wonderful evening at Jaan! The courses perfectly apportioned and served at the right times. The service staff very attentive, professional and knowledgeable. Was also a pleasure to meet the Chef. Ordered the prestige degustation menu. 7 courses with option for cheese. The wagyu main course took 48 hours to prepare and probably my Favourite though all the courses were very delicious
5
Had lunch here with some friends during a pop up from musket room from NY.The food, the service, the view, everything was absolutely outstanding! Will definitely come back to try the food from their own chef soon, 100% sure it's gonna be amazing !Well done

For photos and more reviews, go to hungrybaker.coI returned to Jaan just for its amazing chocolate dessert - and it came with another satisfying gastronomic experience. The modern French restaurant now has one Michelin star - I expected it to have two stars like Odette as I enjoyed my experience here a lot more, but I guess food is divisive and subjective.Quite a few of the dishes are signatures and repeats from the meal I had in April, but I did enjoy them the previous time.We had the five-course Degustation Lunch ($118), with alternatives provided for the fish and meat dishes, which my companion and I do not eat respectively.Prepare for much more than five courses though, as there will be canapes, an amuse bouche, and a lovely bread basket - all before the meal starts. And then a pre-dessert cleanser after.What most people come for is the Soft Organic Hen's Egg, smoked with rosemary. Mine was served with girolles mushroom (my non-meat option) and it was fantastic as always. My companion's favourite dish. But the other courses are wonderful too. Jaan use fresh ingredients bursting with flavour, and simple ingredients such as vegetables and tomatoes are highlighted beautifully, in dishes such as Farmer's Harvest. Only the fish dish was lacking for me on this visit as I felt there could have been a bit more textural contrast. This time, we topped up for Brie de Meaux Truffle, black truffle ice cream, poilane bread (supplement of $20) - we loved the truffle ice cream, it was sweet and earthy, with the dab of olive oil enhancing the flavour of the black truffle. The brie and poilane bread soldiers were slightly underwhelming in comparison, but the dish was cohesive as a whole. The dessert I returned for is the Ivory Caramel - textured chocolate smothered in thick, luscious, rich chocolate foam, piped on the spot by chef Kirk Westaway, who comes to the table with the canister I'd so love to run away with. Nowhere else have I had anything like this. I hope this stays on the menu.You may be stuffed by now, but that's not all though. For Cafe Express, mignardises, you get bite-sized Devonshire cream tea biscuits, Amalfi lemon tarts and Jaan's version of Ferrero Rocher. Enjoyed these very much again. My companion had a hard time deciding between Jaan's famous egg and its Ferrero Rocher as his favourite part of the meal. Look forward to returning again!*Remember to book months ahead if you have a meal planned for a special occasion

This was my very first experience with fine dining over around 10 years ago.I decided to bring my partner here as it was close to my hotel. We were shown great service and very personal. Not robotic or pretentious like many high end restaurants.We did the degustation and it was amazing. I've always been a bit iffy on high end dining in Singapore because it generally doesn't reflect the astronomical prices, but this one was great. The matched wines went very well, and I'd say the waiter was generous with the pours which was a very nice touch.Will be back, but definitely won't be waiting 10 years to do so
5
Beautiful and elegant restaurant with amazing views of the city. Top class dishes with amazingly delightful presentation. Our waitress Reico was very pleasant. Great ambiance and to top it off Chef Westaway came out to introduce the last of 7 dishes. Great dining experience. Highly recommend.
5
I went here with my family to celebrate my dad's birthday. The food was honestly incredible. From the first to the last course you name it, everything was flawless. The only funny downside I experienced was during the moment we were given the chocolate birthday cake. Fortunately it was again great in taste, but then it was served at the very end of our 3 hours long lunch in which we had to rush. 
3
I enjoyed a lunch at Jaan with a friend. Their wine list was pretty good and I love the selection of Krug by the glass of different vintages. The food was of good quality and I particularly praise the use of the high quality ingredients like in the Tomato salad. I loved the truffle ice cream they served with the cheese course. However some of the presentation I found to be overtly fussy. For eg. one of the dishes came in a spherical glass bowl and they injected some flavoured smoke under the bowl which is completely pointless as it never touched the food nor did it create much effect on the senses. We just got the feeling that they were running out of ideas and trying too hard to be a premium product. I would have given it 4 stars however for the price of SGD 700 for two people for lunch, I think it is reasonable to expect a "wow" experience which this definitely was not

We recently celebrated my partners birthday at Jaan and was impressed.The food was amazing; we had the degustation menu ... can't remember how many but it was a lot!! The presentation was out of this world.The staff were very attentive and even brought out a mini birthday cake for my partner; it was a lovely touch
5
Awesome experience! ❤️
Lovely food, nice ambience, great service.
Service staff is attentive and well trained.
Overall, we will definitely come back and recommend this to our friends.

I have dined in many Michelin Star restaurants across the globe but in my eyes and tastebuds, Jaan out classes them all. This isn’t just a meal but an event for the senses.I booked a table next to the window overlooking the Bay via email 3 months before we were to visit Singapore and it was perfect – such a breathtaking view 70 stories above the city at night.We opted for the 10 course artisan menu where we were treated to the most considered collection of tastes, textures, presentations and styles of the freshest and purest ingredients. Chef Kirk served us one of his magical courses and throughout the evening the subtle attentiveness of the staff was immaculate.Jaan is one of the main reasons to visit Singapore and it is most definitely deserving of more than one star. Congratulations and Thank You to Chef Kirk and to all the staff

My first experience at Jaan was truly eye opening! The extraordinary view over the Marina, where we were seated, set a wonderful tone to the meal. The visit was just before National Day 2015, and one unfortunate event was that Chef Julien was not present that day, and neither did we get to meet Chef Kirk. Regardless, from the smoked egg appetiser to the cheese selection and subsequently the Choconuts dessert were truly marvellous from course to course! We spent approximately $300 for 2, with the $20 cheese course supplement, and was money well spent. Will definitely return to Jaan again to try their degustation menu since they have gained a Michelin star since my last visit!
5
We have been to Jaan several times before. But this was our first visit back after they had received the Michelin star. We came for lunch with a couple of colleagues and what can I say we were wowed by the whole experience. To top it all off the aerated chocolate mousse dessert was just heavenly. I'll let the pictures so the talking!
5
You can choose from a few chef menus when you arrive. We opted for the basic menu (from our observation, as did most tables). We were absolutely blown away by the food! Each fish was seasoned and cooked to perfection. The view is nice and service is generally good
5
The degustation lunch is a like a coaster ride tour from an organic farm to the wayward ocean. The dishes were mostly savoury and flavourful. I especially love the tomato flan appetiser and the poached organic hen's egg in smoked rosemary egg basket is both delicious and pleasing to my camera.My partner however loves the iberico pork loin, the meat was tender and yummilicious to the max. The lunch came to an end with pre-dessert, dessert and petite 3... the whole degustation lunch is really filling.

A friend who's a writer for a magazine had invited me for a meal at Jaan. It was exceptional. It was a 10 course artisanal cuisine. We hadFish and ChipsFoie Gras and Truffle MacaronTapioca, Hummus, LinseedFilo Tartlet, Herb SaladCharlotte Potato, Truffle BouillonSpanner CrabCaviar, CauliflowerHeirloom Tomato'Burrata artigiana'Free Range Hen's EggArtichoke, Chorizo IbericoScottish ScallopShellfish BrothJust to name a few. It was just remarkable under the hands of Chef Kirk Westaway.It deserved a standing ovation. Especially the Heirloom Tomato. It is a highest highest honor one can give to tomato
5
JAAN is one of the very best restaurants in Singapore. It offers a stunning view of Marina Bay and service is friendly and attentive. I truly appreciated the personal touch by Chef Kirk in serving the dessert and checking on how we liked the food. We loved everything on the 5-course menu we had, as well as the amuse bouche, pre-dessert, petit fours and complimentary chocolate cake! Finest ingredients with exceptional cooking and new innovations every season. The ivory caramel dessert is just so amazing! This restaurant deserves at least two stars or more! Thank you JAAN for an excellent lunch and wonderful memories
5
My husband and I ate at Jaan on our honeymoon and it was amazing. We are always on the hunt for amazing food and Jaan did not disappoint! We told them it was our honeymoon and they sat us at the best seat in the house - it was truly an amazing view - you can see the Marina Bay Sands and the light show.Not only is the setting beautiful, the food is amazing. We opted for the ten course tasting menu and were not disappointed. It is truly a culinary experience and the chef even came out to describe several of the dishes. We'd also eaten Waku Ghin, which was delicious, but we preferred the tasting menu at Jaan's. I'd absolutely suggest Jaan for a once in a lifetime fine dining experience
5
Oh my word! Thank you to my sister for offering to babysit our little ones. This has to be one of the best meals and experiences I have ever had. The location and view of Marina Bay from such a lofty position, the service and friendliness of the staff and the food! The food is outstanding, the preparation that goes in to some of these dishes is huge and it shows, they are complex in their construction, beautiful in their appearance and the aromas, tastes and textures are just wonderful. To have Kirk Westaway present one of the dishes and talk us through the way his menu came about and showed genuine pleasure in his guests experience at his restaurant. Congratulations on this amazing experience and all the work that has gone towards it.Loved i

One of the finest meals that I have eaten. Delicate and well thought out menu with exceptional service. A can't miss dinner.
5
On each trip to Singapore, a small group of 2 couples try to find an amazing restaurant for our 'kids free' dinner. We certainly found this at Jaan.From commencing with cocktails at the amazing City Space, to a superb degustation feast at Jaan.This restaurant is intimate & classy, with beautiful views over the Singapore skyline. Each course was amazing in its execution, flavour & presentation. And it was great to meet the Chef de Cuisine who personally presents dessert.I can highly recommend Jaan for that special dinner
4
Jaan has been consistently offering high quality food for as long as my memory serves me. The service is decent and the price is also relatively reasonable. It also offers a panorama view of the city on one fine day. Definitely a top 5 fine dining choice in Singapore on my recommendation list
4
Went there for lunch with my wife and the view was spectacular even by day. The service ok but could be improved and the food not as good as the ex chef new restaurant! Of course we shouldn't compare but we went to their ex chef table before and difficult to not compare because the meals are really similar but for us not as good as there! The chef came for desert and was really nice but for us didn't change the all experience which was good but not that good
5
The whole atmosphere was so amazing. From the starter to desserts, everything tastes decent and totally instagram-worthy. Even more, we got to sit by the window, where the view was as lovely as the service at this restaurant. One of the must-to-go fine dining places in Singapore
4
We went there for a special celebration and the food was superb! It is a real feast for the senses from visual appeal, to taste, smell and fantastic flavors. The chef is very creative and celebrates the ingredients in a very innovative way! Defo worth the try! It is worth 2 Michelin stars. A pity that one of the waiter was a bit rude, the wine list came after being served the starter and that we were left alone for a while when waiting for to pay the bill. By improving these few points, Jaan will easy get the 2nd star next year!

We have experienced some of the best restaurants the world has to offer. Jaan was our first real fine dining experience years ago, so we did a revisit. Very happy to receive our table request, the view and restaurant remain as spectacular. The food was of a great standard, but it almost seemed like an assembly of dishes, rather than a food journey. I say this in reference to the phenomenal journey undertaken at the likes of Andre. We added the wine pairing, and this is where expectations were certainly not met. I am used to having the wine explained when undertaken as a tasting, it's an important part of the meal. I want to know how it adds to the food experience, it's vintage, where it's from. Alas, the sommelier just tipped the wine in the glass, said barely an audible word and was turned away looking at the next table before pouring the last few drops. All this for $190 p/p. I would go so far as to say, the wines didn't really pair very well with the meal. The experience, and you go to a restaurant like this and spend the money for the experience, was just not there. I would be reluctant to return on any future visits.
4
Fine dinning at its best is hard to achieve as it have to every single details work perfectly.The presentation and taste of the food was excellent with a couple of surprises. Wine list is simple and well balanced.With the new Chef Kirk in charge and being hands on its a blessing.We had a excellent night with excellent food and service can be a little bit more warming
5
I absolutely loved this place!! From decor, to view, to quality, it was perfect!! I was happy to receive a completely vegetarian 5 course meal with exceptional quality and presentation. The taste of the food was extremely new to me. Every dish was composed of a mix of different flavours. This was interesting but extremely tasty. In the whole meal, I was able to taste everything from spice to sour to sweet. It was exquisite. I thought that the service and quality was amazing and very well done. It was expensive but worth it. The ambiance of the restaurant was great, the view was obviously incredibly. The staff was friendly and treated us well
4
We decided to have the five course menu with the wine pairing. The amuses and dishes were all very authentic and special but the wines with the food were very marginal. When you pay such a high amount for wine, and yes we know Singapore is expensive on its alcohol, you expect more than just a sip of wine per course. Very friendly staff and professional and was nice having the Polish chef at our table for dessert. The view was incredible, although the price for the lunch was as well. Be aware of the high cost and that they do not serve a lunch menu on a Saturday - you have to take a minimum of 5-7 courses instead of the 2-3 during the week
5
My husband and I celebrated our 15th anniversary at Jaan last June. It was just perfect (except the champagne which was not sparkling at all ... but they immediately replaced our two glasses). The dished were delightful, creative and for some of them, just amazing ! I would definitively recommend this restaurant for special occasions to celebrate
5
Had an amazing lunch out with my good friends at Jaan last week. Besides the stunning view of the restaurant, the services standard is impeccable. Helmed by the Restaurant manager Mr. Frank Philippine, every staff is a services ambassador for Jaan and Swissotel and makes the culinary experience a truly fabulous one. Besides Frank, special thank to Ms Reiko for her exceptional customer services, professional and attentive. The culinary skill of Master Chef Kirk Westaway is impressive and he never fails to surprise us with his new creations. Every meal at Jaan is a treat to both the taste platelets and to the eyes.The fine dining restaurant at Swissotel will always be my top choice to charm and impress my guests or friends.B Go

We had lunch at Jaan and was seated right next the window with gorgeous views of Singapore. Service was great.We settled for the 5 course tasting menu. The appetisers and dessert was great and delicious. The mains were below my expectation and it was nothing special. The lamb cuts were very thinly sliced and was disappointing - lamb is my favourite. Would recommend trying another main other than the lamb
5
This was my first visit to JAAN since Kirk Westaway took over after Julien Royen left to set up Odette at the National Gallery. I have always loved JAAN for the quality of it's food and service and certainly wasn't disappointed with the new set up.The food was as always fabulous, Kirk has retained some of the classic dishes such as the 55' Rosemary smoked organic egg, but has also added some additions of his own which are just as delicious. He takes the time to come and greet the guests with one of the courses which is a lovely touch and one we greatly appreciated.The front of house staff are as efficient as ever, but have lost a little of the friendliness that the staff had previously. One particular front of house member always used to remember us from one visit to the next and that I am left handed - a wonderful touch but sadly missing now.The wine pairings with the gourmand tasting menu were according to my husband - interesting! but not necessarily spot on. We recently came across the most wonderful sommelier at Lewin Terrace who would do well to be nabbed by JAAN or one of the other top flight restaurants.All in all then, a great young chef, with a wonderful future, delicious food, efficient staff and a great view - what's not to like
5
Jaan was one of our firm favourites when it was run by Julien Royer so we were very interested to see how it was doing under the Kirk Westaway's leadership. My verdict is that it's now even better than before.Set on the 70th floor of the Swissotel, it's a fairly intimate space with great views over Marina Bay. Don't worry if you don't get a window table because the non-window tables still have a fairly good view. In fact, the view doesn't really matter because there are far better things to grab your attention on the table...We chose the ten course Epicurean tasting menu and it was fabulous. From the little savouries and the amuse bouche right through to the puddings, every course was an absolute delight. Each dish was beautifully presented and showed some lovely inventive touches, but at no time did I feel that presentation had taken precedence over taste. All the ingredients were very fresh and perfectly cooked, and the balance of flavours was a delight. I would also recommend the wine paring, where they had chosen some interesting wines each of which complemented the food very well.The service was also first rate. Not only was it efficient, the waiting staff were also very engaged and really seemed to care that we should enjoy the meal.It is undoubtedly expensive, but I thought it was well worth it for the quality of the meal we had. Overall I thought it was an excellent meal and a highly enjoyable evening. We shall undoubtedly return

Culinary experience on 70th floor. With just speechless view! I guess all what I loved is only the view and presentation of the food though not all of that. When I was reserving the table it was just a dozen of but.. but.. And the restaurant kept putting a rules to us. I understand that this a fine dining experience but why we can't have different courses in one table? The reservation team failed cause they noted that we don't eat meat when I clearly mention on email that I've got mint allergy! She was struggling to send me confirmation too......Yes some of the dishes are interesting, but the special dessert is just all in chocolate. Chocolate cake, chocolate foam and chocolate candies what is completely messed up with the taste. Didn't worth the birthday dinner. Wouldn't recommend at all. They've got nothing much to be excited of and being charged so much.

Fab, ear-popping view, at night. Small restaurant that makes one feel kind of exclusive (I suppose one is to be dining there). Good menus of degustation (I don't believe they do a la carte)- we particularly enjoyed the pigeon. I'm not a big fan of foam in dishes (too close to saliva) that seems to be de rigeur these days and quite a few dishes were foamy - including one with a cauliflower foam (quite an honour for the humble cauliflower). Jaan is a good choice for special occasions. there was an organic egg dish that involved a fair bit of drama, cold smoke rising. rosemary burning etc. The egg itself was, well, eggy. Good liquor policy that works for big groups - buy one bottle and bring one of your own to match. I'd go back to Jaan again
3
I have been to Jaan first for dinner, then for lunch. First was a romantic dinner, second was special occasion lunch with another couple. I was not unhappy with our dinner experience, cannot tell anything disturbing, but I felt like nothing was extra special to deserve the price we paid, so I did not go back for more than a year. Then our friends picked up Jaan for lunch and I decided to give one more chance. Up until main course, everything was OK, then I received my fish served with the Saran Wrap outside! The chef came and apologized and they took the fish out of the bill. Most probably, it was my bad luck as the rest of the food was delicious, but I am not sure I will visit Jaan again.

This restaurant is in my top 10 restaurants I dined in. The decor does not speak much in the restaurants favor however the view makes up for it.Dishes that had me in 7th heaven: oyster with artichoke and caviar, egg 65 with smoked potato espuma, not to forget the signature dish of tomato, Each dish in the tasting menu was executed to perfection. The above were just my favorites, but seems unfair to not mention the other dishes as they were delicious.The restaurant places so much value and importance on the products they purchase. They choose only the best ingredients and ensure they cook those produce in the best way to guarantee its flavor/texture/temperature.Service was attentive and friendly yet not overbearing. You will find chefs coming to your table to present certain dishes which I find a personal touch to the dining experience.Although the price tag does not come cheap every dollar is worth it and I would re-live this dining experience again. The quality and perfection of the food is a must for all proclaimed "foodies"
5
Just perfect ! Though we are not big fans of the decoration style, we loved each of the dishes : perfect balance, creativity, increbible seaoning (no need to ask for more salt and pepper, what we always usually do !), good service (except for the 2002 Krug champagne which was not sparkling at all and that they had to serve again ...). We warmly recommend this restaurant. To be booked with a long notice period to get a table with a view as there are not a lot of cover
3
Booked 2 weeks in advance and asked for window seat, unfortunately all window seats already taken. I pre booked the 5 course artisanal cuisine degustation menu for both of us plus the wine pairing. Overall the food itself was well presented and very tasty with a nice combination of ingredients and flavours. The wine pairing was well thought out.....however....the menu delivered to us was different to the one published online. The wine pairing for course 3/4/5 was different to the published list and the dessert had somehow changed from Ivory Caramel to a strawberry composition. The main was two miniature slices of lamb. Hardly what we would call a main. The thing was no one bothered to even tell us beforehand of these changes to the menu or wine pairings. Interior design was little weird and not what we expected for a restaurant of this standard. Looking back at the total bill ($790) vs the amount of food provided we were essentially paying $40 per plate of food. Overall it was one of those places that had to be ticked off the list of top end restaurants in Singapore but we wouldn't go back. There are plenty of other restaurants with better overall experience.
5
So this place is on the rooftop with nice views. Essentially there is only one recommended menu and if you are vegetarian take the vegetarian choice. There is another simpler menu but the recommended one is the good one. I thought the food was completely fantastic but then I like pigeon. The chef like rosemary as a herb and that suited us fine. So many dishes - all very excellent. They do this thing where they also have to pour the sauce in front of you for every dish which I think is very passé but at the end of the day - the food is just very good.
5
The location on the 70th floor overlooking the marina is already a great asset. The restaurant itself is decorated modestly. The food is delicious. We opted for the 7 course menu. Especially the 'heirloom tomato ' and the 'soft organic hen's egg' are a culinarry feast. The pairing with the wines is also excellent and really adds something extra to each course. So if you're into fine dining and your in Singapore; Jaan is a solid choice
5
Been long time we wanted to visit this restaurant and finally did so with my Birthday. We took a 7 course menu. Every dish was excellent, special favorite was foie gras and a dessert, my husband especially appreciated the creativity and taste of tomato-burrata plate. Dessert, chocolate-caramel, was breathtakingly delicious! The only tiny complaint is the pigeon portion was too tiny. Splendid views on Singapore as a bonus! It's been one of the most memorable and delicious dinners in Singapore!
5
Hubby brought me to Jaan within Swissotel. Reservations were made and we were seated right next to the beautiful skyline! We have been to many fine-dining restaurants but nothing beats Jaan! We ordered the Epicure lunch, a 7 course cuisine. The presentation of the dishes were one of its kind, especially the black truffle with foie gras in between the mini macaroons lying atop the wooden branches. Sweet and salty! Jaan also took care of our dietary restrictions. As I'm lactose intolerant, my dishes were slightly different from hubby's (as you can see from one of the pics: Potato Puree in white cups). The "Sea urchin, avocado puree with cavier" was so beautiful to look at I couldn't bear to destroy. I love the cold sparkling taste of the basil puree served with the Heirloom Tomato. There were also scallops, fish (mine with no creme) and the world's most tender beef that we had ever had! No space to upload all the zoomed-in pictures though. And then there were desserts, of cse! My dessert was different, once again because of "no milk and egg" restriction for that day. The staff presented us a complimentary anniversary chocolate cake too. Would revisit Jaan again, for sure! Missing the tender beef already! You bet I was swallowing my saliva just scrolling through my photo album to search for the pics. :)
5
Everything about this restaurant is excellent. The attention to detail is second to none - from the location with its jaw-dropping view of Singapore to the presentation of the dishes. Every course is arranged to maximise the taste and impact of its ingredients. You can tell that someone, or a group of someones, has spent a great deal of time time thoughtfully considering the presentation and flavours of each plate. The wine is, as you would expect, matched to perfection with each course. The intimate size makes the whole experience feel much more like an exclusive private dinner party than a restaurant - but with your own award-winning chef
5
This is an experience you cannot miss while in Singapore. All services were impeccable... The food is amazing ... This is truly culinary art. Wine paring is spectacular. The view is great but the food is even better! We even had the pleasant surprise to have our dessert serve by the chef! Bravo c'est très réussi - le concept est génia
3
Perhaps I have high expectation for Jaan, however "wow" factor was lack in the menu. But the dessert was the best among the dishes. However the view from Jaan can comfort my high expectation. Thanks for arranging window seats for us and the service was great!
5
One of the best restaurants we have been to around the world. We decided to go for the 5 course degustation menu. The food was amazing. Each creation was like a little delicious work of art. The flavours and textures of each dish from the first to the last were very interesting.The service was also very friendly and efficient and chef Kirk Westaway came by to serve the dessert and was extremely nice and welcoming. The view is amazing as well - there are no bad tables in the entire place. Thank you to chef Westaway and the entire team for a memorable night

Jaan is a dichotomy. The food is excellent but for $592..£300 for one so it should be! Accepted that I had a nice half bottle of Nuit St George, still pricey at $189, but the truth is the whole ambience is more like a $50 meal than a $600 establishment. I was initially sat with my back in the middle of the entrance corridor until I complained! The setting for any of the tables however is really not great and the decor poor for a restaurant of this status. My hotel bedroom at the Ritz Carlton is 100 times better in terms of views. Also when I complained of extremely cold air con (lots of the ladies sitting were clearly cold and uncomfortable) the head waiter said "we really struggle to control the air con in the building and we have to switch it on and off repeatedly" ... surely not what you expect for $600 per person! The service between courses was extremely slow, where you just get colder and colder! I actually asked for the bill before getting desert as I had waited so long! Thankfully the air con was on the off mode by then. However The chef came to apologise and ask if everything was alright ! Clearly he knew it wasn't. The dichotomy is that the food is excellent. However Would I go back... Definitely not! NO NO N
5
Without any hesitation I would recommend this restaurant. The food is delicate and brilliant the views are 2nd only to Sydney Harbour - we had the privilege to dine here when Singapore celebrated 50 years of independence - what a spectacular show unfolding in front of us and the food was first rate
5
A epic journey of 7 highly creative and flavoursome courses was enjoyed while perched on a window side table on the 75th floor.JAAN is elegant and delicious modern French  fare that is part art and part science.  From the artisan breads to 45 minute poached egg, perfect snapper, and baked pigeon (if it can't be prepared well here, where can it be?), the cuisine was top shelf.  The desserts were deliciously rich and ample, and the view was the best way to appreciate the utter vibrancy that is packed into this island country of Singapore.Low point - 'House' champagne starts from $50 a glass.High point - A lifetime memory of the finest and most picturesque dining experience

Tried the 4 hands lunch during restaurant week and was sorely disappointed. the extremely poor service did the chef a great disservice. after i was led to my table, i was left alone for at least 5minutes with no menu, water etc. i looked around looking lost, but nobody came. when the first 'course' came, it was a selection of 4 small dishes. No guidance as to where i should start first. as i was literally about to put the morsel from the 2nd small dish into my mouth, the waiter popped up and said 'here is your amuse bouche'. erm. so now i had 5 small dishes on the table. this is the first time i've encountered such ridiculous service in a restaurant/cafe. the wait staff seemed indifferent to the food i..e they didn't seem excited nor interested in the food, just went through the script when explaining. i tried to put the poor service out of my mind to give the chef a chance but the dishes did not live up to expectations. they were not inspiring, disconnected and the baked celeriac was too salty. the palate cleanser came before desert. it should have been given in between the entrees because it was so sweet that, in the end, i felt i had 2 deserts.  there are calls for Jaan to be on the Michelin list, but it has a long way to go. Rhubarb, Odette and The Corner House have the advantage by many miles
4
Amuse bouche, Heirloom tomato and pigeon were the stand outs of the evening. Drinks were expensive (as is the norm in Singapore) but wine list expansive. Service was relaxed, use of iPad for the wine list curious. Overall the menu is what you would expect for the price but not a 5 star experience.
4
An amazing experience dining at Jaan lived up to the hype – specially the desserts. From the house-baked breads to the spectacular desserts, every aspect of the experience was artfully created and executed! Service, quality, ambience is world-class – get the corner table for spectacular views over the MBS. Excellent culinary combinations one of I've ever had … too many great dishes to mention to complete the multi-course meal. Excellent dining with stunning view, a must when visiting Singapore
4
A great dining pleasure. From the welcome to the farewell the evening was elegant, staff were courteous, food was amazing and wine selection superb. A bit pricey, however compared to other fine dining places in Singapore, this is worth the spend. I certainly would recommend this to diners for any special occasion. Jaan team - Keep it up
5
I had the most stunning lunch last Sunday at Jaan. From the amuse-bouches to petit fours, each course was visually stunning and heavenly tasting. I have seldom had a 7 course meal where each course was a superb, Michelin star-worthy experience but I did at Jaan. Chefs Kirk Westaway and his sous-chef Bart Cywinski demonstrate cooking that is creative and utterly delicious without resorting to chemistry or cliché. Highlights included the truffle broth with potato puree, the heirloom tomatoes with olive crumble, the artichoke cream and 65* egg, the slow-cooked smoked pigeon breast, I could go on. One Michelin star would be too low, relative to how stars are distributed in Asia. By London or France standards this meal was a high two stars. Service was attentive and discreet. View is stunning. Hurry there before they get their well-deserved stars and the prices go up!
5
We had our wedding anniversaire at Jaan with dégustation menu, it took a long time before getting a booking for a window table which is definitely worth the wait... Food was amazing as you can expect from this kind of high end gastronomy restaurant. If I have to mention something to improve I will definitely mention the service: we had to wait for our cocktails which arrive after we started the food... waiters tend to rush you, but after mentioning to them we were there to enjoy our time without rushing they change their attitude
1
Had high hope, but left unsatisfied. Service was good initially when we arrived as we were the 1st table, but eventually we were left unattended most of the time. Food was forgettable, or rather unforgettable for its saltiness for some dishes... We waited & waited for our bills to come, no one was coming near us, and we finally get attention of a waitress, she said she was waiting for our instruction to return us our card! (Which we realized it was sitting there at the service table.) How to give instruction when no one came to our table?!? And We gave our credit card to them expecting the next reasonable thing was for them to come back with our bill! We mentioned twice that we are celebrating our boys 21st birthday, they did not even bother with it, most restaurant will put a small candle on one of the course dessert just for the gesture, nope, nothing at all... We are not looking for extra free cake, we can't even bother to finish their dessert!!! Terrible, we have been to many high end restaurants, but it's certainly a lousy one!FYI- We are a group of 6, ordered Krug Champagne Grand Cuvée, & another bottle of red wine, 7 course set, total bill $2500+They only have good view... Nothing more..
5
Dined here for our 25th Wedding Anniversary. This was one of the best restaurant experiences. We had the 7 course degustation with the highlights being, the soft organic hens egg and the dessert which consisted of chocolate ice cream, chocolate moose which was incredible. We were lucky enough to be seated right at the window with sweeping views of Singapore
5
I just loved the place and the food - so nice. Worth to experience. The menu is relatively small but yes all dished well composed of fresh ingredients. Sure this is one of the best in Singapore.
5
My wife and I came for my birthday and we were instantly touched by the service and quality. The food was exceptionally presented and tasted amazing. Great wine list and the view is the best I have had in Singapore.

Jaan, derived from the ancient Sanskrit word for ‘bowl’, is currently ranked 29th in Asia’s 50 Best Restaurants. Currently lead by Chef de Cuisine Kirk Westway, Jaan offers elevated modern french cuisine with imaginative twists and beautiful aesthetics. I visited this establishment with Miss M in September 2015 as a celebration for both of our birthdays.This restaurant had been on my to-go list for a very long time. Having only 40 seats in the dining room, it was quite a challenge to get a reservation in their restaurant. During my previous visit to Singapore, I had tried calling them up to reserve a table one week in advance, but it was fully booked. So during my subsequent trip, I’ve made sure to e-mail them about one month in advance.Located on the 70th floor of Equinox Complex, entering the restaurant is an experience by itself. There is a booth at the ground floor that leads the way to an elevator up to the restaurant. After passing through several short hallways, we entered the restaurant and were lucky enough to be seated at a table with a spectacular view that oversees the Marina Bay Sands. The set up of the dining room felt really special with its bright, classy interior at such a high elevation. This was by far the most romantic restaurant I’ve ever been.Jaan serves 3, 5 and 7 courses for lunch. For our experience, we chose ‘Degustation Lunch at Jaan’ which was comprised of 5 courses for $118 per person.Dining at Jaan was one of the best fine dining experiences I’ve had so far. At a very affordable price point of $118, I would say that their lunch degustation was more than worth it. However, be mindful that they have an additional charge for their amuse bouche which was automatically included in our lunch.Their stand out dishes were the heirloom tomato collection and their rosemary infused organic egg. I can’t praise them enough for the creativity and artistry demonstrated in all of their dishes. All of their plates looked so aesthetically pleasing to the eyes. All these factors combined, along with excellent service, lead to a very enjoyable meal.For a full review, please visit eatsleepliverepeat.com/2016/03/25/jaan-singapore

Last night my wife and I enjoyed a beautiful meal at Jaan Restaurant in the Equinox Centre in downtown Singapore. I had booked the restaurant to celebrate my wife's birthday. The things that caught my eye in choosing Jaan was the variety on each of the degustation options, the fact that we enjoy Great British Menu and the Head Chef was from England and his stated aim of using the freshest ingredients from all over the world was appealing.We arrived at Jaan at around 7.30 pm and after a little mix up with who we were we were seated in what is a reasonably small room at a table in the centre. One thing that stood out was how cold (temperature) the room was. I was wearing a suite and didn't take my jacket off all night. My wife had to wear a scarf all evening as well.However, all this became insignificant once we'd ordered and the food started arriving. A couple of little tasting dishes arrived first (not part of the ordered meal) which were scrumptous and beautifully presented. This set the tone for what was to come and I can assure you, we weren't disappointed. The wines all had a unique taste and blended very well with each course. The stand out for us was the Pigeon and the Chocolate desert. Of the seven courses, there was only one I didn't like but this was more about my tastes than the way the dish was prepared.At the end of the evening a table beside the window became available and our waiter moved us over and we had our desert, coffee and tea looking out at Singapore by night. We were also visited by Chef Kirk Westaway who delivered our deserts and then bid us good evening as we left at 11.30 pm - a very nice touch on what had been a lovely evening. The overall food and service experience was first class and anyone who wants to try world class food and who lives or is visiting Singapore should think seriously about booking a table at Jaan

We had an outstanding meal here. The food was amazing! The service was also excellent The view out over the city was just beautiful. The chef was very creative with his dishes. I can't say enough good things about this restaurant. I would highly recommend it

The memories of this delightful evening brought me here to write this long overdue review. Singapore has so much to offer in dining options that one might get lost at selecting a venue. If you are up for an exquisite meal, great awakening of all senses, amazing view of the Lion city combined with an intimate setting, look no further. From the stoves of his perched kitchen, Chef Westaway does an amazing job with his dedicated team. The heirloom tomato appetiser was strikingly simple and beautiful. Take your time, relax and unwind. The service lead by manager Frank is flawless. Great place!

Absolutely delicious food. Excellent and creative vegetarian tasting menu. The heirloom tomato and the pumpkin cannelloni were particular highlights. My meat-eating husband was equally impressed with his meal. The head chef came out to talk to us and other diners about his creations - a nice touch

I do not know whether Michelin Star ratings are awarded in Singapore or not and what qualifies to get the star! In my opinion no matter what the menu is its a combination of essentials that make it outstanding! Food- Am diabetic and rate the food on whether I fall sick or not, sugar levels go haywire or not which are standards tough to beat. Have eaten there 3 times and phew not fallen sick and stable sugar levels. Second is impeccable service. Perfect service and advise! Wish I had informed them that I am diabetic as Sam assured me that Chef Kirk would have happily rustled up a diabetic friendly desert. Hope that Jaan gets Michelin Star or above which it so rightly deserves! In my opinion its one of the best in Singapore. Quality comes at a price so can't complain but I wish I could eat there everyday and be on the top of my health

The food at Jaan, the whole experience, is a first class delight. From the view out on to the marina, to the caliber of the warm and congenial service, the experience flows like a lovely tasteful gastronomic journey. Highlights are every course, but special standouts include an earthy and creamy amuse bouche, heirloom tomatoes that bring the tastes of the classic Italian bruschetta to the plate and ivory chocolate. Of all the dishes ivory chocolate stands out for its balance and restraint in a chocolate dish. Where many chefs go heavy handed, head chef Kirk Westaway, sails through with a gentle touch, creating a delicious sensation that pushes on the edge of ecstasy. If you dine at only one restaurant in Singapore, make sure it is Jaan. Or do as I did and repeat the experience whilst you are there..

First time at this restaurant and it won't be the last. Food was tremendous, service responsive and unobtrusive. We were able to get a window seat by booking in advance - so I'd suggest doing the same. The view is spectacular. Head Chef (Kirk Westaway) came out to tables to introduce one of the dishes - and sign a copy of the menu for us, which we thought was nice touch. Highlights included the hand dived scallops with seaweed hollandaise, the confit wild snapper, forest pigeon (with special effects at the table!). The dessert (ivory caramel, chocolates) was superb
5
Nice restaurant with great food and service, the staff are wonderful, food was up to mark as well.1st time been here and will be back again!!

Jaan is the perfect venue for a special occasion or client entertainment. It offers a lot of privacy and space to ones who seek those two things. The food can be better, I have to admit but the service is truly 5 star.
5
At first when we came to the restaurant, we were stunned by the view over the Marina Bay. When we left, the view wasn't what we talked about - it was the food! We had 7 courses with wine menu, the wines were tasty and matched the dishes very well. When each dish was served, we were amazed by the creativity of the collation and each dish had a fantastic taste with different nuances and temperatures of the different components. When I visit Singapore again, I will go to Jaan again for sure
5
I took my girlfriend here for her birthday and we were impressed with both the staff, the chef and most of all the food. From the first course to the last the food was well presented, and tasted unbelievable. The English Chef came to our table as part of the dishes to have a chat and pour a jus onto one of the courses. We had a fantastic evening only spoiled slightly by the rain on the windows interrupting the amazing view of Singapore. The only issue we had was when we left the restaurant and got to the bottom of the Swissotel, trying to get a cab was a nightmare and we ended up walking back to our hotel

We came here on the last night of our honeymoon expecting a special experience and were not disappointed. From start to finish, in my view what was on offer was of a Michelin-star standard - in terms of the food and the service. It was a lovely touch when Kirk Westaway (the chef) came out to speak to us not once but twice regarding (a) the main course and (b) the dessert, and the staff were even good enough to give us a (delicious) cake as a wee extra celebratory treat.And then there's the view. Initially, we were seated a table behind the window though you could still get a feel of that 70th-floor outlook. In another lovely touch though, and again one that spoke to the excellent service, we were moved to a window seat for dessert which allowed us to take in the wonderful vista, from Downtown all the way round to Raffles across the road.I understand Michelin are on their way to Singapore this year to start dishing out stars - having eaten in a number of Michelin-starred restaurants in the last few years, I think Kirk Westaway and his team deserve at least 1

The best thing about the restaurant is the view. The design of the room is however not ideal for viewing except for 2 or three tables by the Windows which are difficult to get. The decor is minimalist however I was disturbed by the fact that it seemed unfinished except for the ceiling. But we went there also for the food. The service initially was a bit disorganized but then settled in. It is not 2 or 3 star. I didn't like the single wine menu on a IPAD that everyone touches. The wine list though not bad, is certainly not large. The wine steward was a bit inexperienced as I guess the sommelier was gone. We ordered the 5 course tasting menu. The oyster dish just didn't work for us. The salad was very flavorful. The trout had a weird gummy consistency. Not sure if it was undercooked or intentional. I am not a big fan of Venison so I can't comment. The dessert was the best part of the meal.Everything was beautifully presented in an artistic fashion.What will we remember. Probably the view

My friend recommended this place after she dined at Jaan 1 year ago. I was hesitant at first as she had Chef Julien run the kitchen. This time around we had Chef Kirk Westaway and we were absolutely mind blown with the level of creativity in presentation, combination of flavours and really impressive quality of the finest ingredients! We had the 7 course Menu Prestige and everything served up was so delicious! Chef Kirk even came to every table to pay a visit, explained the last main dish and made sure we were having a good night! Also the service and the view was everything you could ask for!
5
Took the 5 course vegetarian meal and each of the courses had amazing presentation and a wonderful taste to say the least. I loved the amuse-bouche, a mushroom soup.I was unsure if a veg-menu would be as exiting in a fine-dining setup; but chef did a wonderful job on that.
5
We last visited Jaan over 5 years ago so it was good to experience Kirk Westaway's culinary style. We were not disappointed. The food was sensational - each course was a wonderful surprise and it was clear that a lot of thought and effort had gone into each dish. My husband had organised lunch here for my birthday about a month beforehand so we were gifted with a table by the window over the spectacular views to MBS. The restaurant even organised a delicious chocolate mousse birthday cake (divine!).I highly recommend a visit to Jaan. For lunch it offers incredible value for money

Made a reservation months in advance and arrived to be told no set available - ended up eating in their sister restaurant which was fine - but wonÂ´t be going back
5
Chef Julien created a delightful all vegetarian tasting spring menu. Go for the first sitting to see sunset as well. Sublime experience.
4
We went to Jaan, for our wedding anniversary,after reading the many fantastic reviews on it.We chose the 10 course degustaton menu, not really knowing what the season's special dishes will be, but trusting that we will be totally pampered by Chef Kirk.The canape itself, comprising of macaroons, a trendy remake of fish and chips, and a wagyu wrap, was beautiful and delicious. The rest of the dishes were all beautifully presented, and paced well.Of the many delicious dishes, I particularly enjoyed the seared scallops with the season's vegetables. The scallop was gently seared on the outside, and soft and succulent on the inside.I would highly recommend this restaurant with great service, which has a fantastic view of the Singapore river, the Marina and CBD, to couples who want a quiet, romantic place to dine in.

Elegant. A rare and SO fabulous treat for vegetarians to be treated to a 7 course beautiful meal. Yet, here it is! My husband had the "regular" menu with meat/fish and I had the veg. Everything was divine (which I don't say often). Presentation with care and true appreciation for the lovely vegetable. The chef (who's mother was vegetarian) stood at the door and presented us with a bag of tiny French artichokes as we left. How often the vegetarian is deprived of this level of experience. We went for my birthday but I am already thinking up excuses for another occasion
5
A friend of ours told us about his great dining experience here so we were totally looking forward to going there and booked for lunch. Luckily they had a table for us. The view is spectacular. We saw a storm come in, rain and then the whole city magically appeared below our feet, it was awesome. They have 7-8 people in the front taking care of the maximum of 40 guests that they can seat. So the service is very attentive. Chef Julien creates a wonderful dining experience. Everything we had was delicious, the heirloom tomato salad, followed by the inspired salad, trout, pumpkin canoloni and their signature mixed chocolate desert served with a warm mousse. We added in the cheese course and wish we had elected for the 7 course instead of the 5 course meal. Would love to back again.

views are amazing of Singapore from your table, service is excellent, needed to slow down the pace though, we had the matched wines and the servings are to small for the glass of wine and you seem to be non stop finishing your wine ready for the next course, I had to give up drinking them so would advise you only buy a bottle or by the glass when you need it, not have the matched wines throughout..Food was beautifully presented, chef had gone to a lot of trouble.with the preparation.Frank, the Manager was very knowledgeable about the wine, thank you for a great evening

My friend had highly recommended Jaan, thus my boyfriend & I had tried to make a reservation in July 2015 for our anniversary on the same month but it was fully book. We then decided to make a 2 months advance booking in Aug for Oct 2015 to celebrate my birthday. The reservation went on smoothly with Patricia communicating to us via email. She also made an effort to send an sms a week before the actual day. On the email, I had told her that the dinner was to celebrate my birthday and Jaan prepared a complimentary chocolate cake which I really appreciated. Jaan does not have ala carte menu, thus we preordered our 5 course set dinner/pax and the dinner started promptly. The dinner was fabulous, all of the dishes was perfectly prepared, the uniqueness of how each and every dish was prepared is definitely worth the penny paid. The only slight disappointment was despite the 2 months advance booking, we were not able to secure a window seat. The view was also compromised due to the haze. Having said so, we have enjoyed the excellent service provided and the awesome food. Although the dinner was pricey (about SGD500), I wouldn't mind to visit another time. Oh how much I miss the food there now
5
View is good, together with food and service . Dinner was about 3 hours for us and we are the last diner , but the service staffs were really patient with us and polite . Food plating is amazing and fresh Will try the set lunch next time
5
I took my mom for her birthday dinner at Jaan and it was worth every dollar spent . The chef went above and beyond to make this dining experience unforgettable for her , so many little surprises that make us smile and enjoy it even more . Thank you for making that evening truly amazing !

Honestly , I were thinking put rating as terrible, however I rated it a sightly better as for the night view, which is the only thing that we paid for the premier.My hubby booked JAAN for our 3rd year anniversary. After view all the positive commends, we had very high expectation, here is a few point.Environment & Service;- 1) Very cold in the restaurant (hubby got very sick after dinning & next day) & uncomfortable 2) Staffs ware friendly but wasn't able to pay attention to each table (consider there are small restaurant with nearly 5-6 staffs) . For example : 1) they bought us butter between the course, but they forgot serving us bread. We saw other table all served , we didn't call them in to question as we like to see the service level. We been waited & waited. After we fished 3rd dishes, they realized they forgot the bread, then they bought our bread in with out any apology. 2) nobody will explain / reminder us what will come next and do we still have any courses left. As we been left in the corner for a while, No menu in hands as it was been taken in the beginning and nobody come to talk to us, we thought maybe we done. so we paid the bill, THEN they brought us 2 more course of deserts.....What (?!?!?!?)Food : Let me ask you, do you like Airy white foam? If you do or fancy it , here is the right place , as most of the food will give you the tasteless white foam. You can call its art as typical French food :0) But not for me, not for almost every dishes...as for me i imagine saliva (excuse me). That's why its not appetizing to me at all same to my husband. The white foam is 20-25% of the dishes.Degustation : As its like the name, you will get each course one mouth full... Not joking, the dish ‘Carrasco’ ham size you get is 1 pieces of paper thing ham , size of 2cm x 1cm (LOL) , oh well degustation..... Cooking Technic : all ingredients are very fresh, in Japan we eat raw anyway, so for the scallop, nothing special as you can taste the raw fish smell. The pork has pork stink (the small block one) , which i will never expecting taste in this high end restaurant. Chief should taste it, you don't need extremely good palate to tell it.Cheese : the size of the cheese they cutting is smaller than Pub's match box size and 2mm thick. 4 pieces $40. For end of the dinner, they will offer Coffee or Tea. I loooove coffee, but for Friday late night dinner 10pm, will you fanny a coffee? Sorry, i am still too Asian maybe.. Chef : It is true if you read the negative commends from others, Chef will introduce himself to other tables. Again it is not big restaurant, he went to a few tables and introduced himself and the dishes. but never come to our table even say 'Hi'. what a rubbish manner. Not try to be funny, I were very hungry after Friday long day work. We had high expectation about this restaurant, but I filled up by the bread as the food worth us $500+ was truly DEGUSTATION! The End
5
Jaan has been a top 10 local dining destination since Andre Chiang took over many years ago and now we're on to the 2nd or 3rd chef after Andre, but still goodDecided on the 10 course surprise menu. I won't list every dish, but suffice to say, it was a gastronomic marathon . There were 2 amuse bousche , an optional cheese course and petit fours, so it's really 14 courses. Standouts include the 55 degree egg with its dry ice presentation. Slight disappointments include the undercooked pigeon main and fish that came with fried scalesOverall excellent, and 5 hours well spent
5
During our stay in the Swissotel we visited Restaurant jaan on the top floor. The view, the Service and of course the Food are amazing.
5
I am sure by now, many would have given the readers a general feel on the items served at Jaan - 5, 7 course set menu being the most common. Wine pairing option available. For the more costs conscious crowd, lunch would be the best chance to try out this famous French restaurant. I had lunch at 118 (5 course) + wine pairing at 98. Still water at 16 per bottle. (I think tap drinking water option can be accommodated) As a pre meal offering, small bites like wagyu beef roll, mushroom soup etc are served. Delicate setting and visually artisanal. Great for photo moment - and for the price, why not? The 55 min perfectly cooked egg was by far one of the best egg I have had. The sheer work put in ( as explained by Chef Kirk himself) was worth the price tag. Loved both mains, the fish and the short ribs. Tender, juicy, flavorful! 5 glasses of wine pairing was ok and even thou I would have wished that they can top up the wine, I was pretty flushed after downing 5 glasses. I would say that you wouldn't have missed out much without it. Every single bit was scraped off the plate. At level 70th of Swissotel, 5 star restaurant with limited seating like 10 tables, diligently created menu, exquisite taste, a handsome chef & prompt service crew - it's worth every cent it charges. I don't splurge on my meals, but if I had to, this will be on my list.
5
Best of the 3 Top 100 World list we visited in Singapore. The tasting menu was wonderful and a very good value for these types of dinners. The only hiccough was that even though we were an early seating and had a reservation, they first offered us a table next to the kitchen door away from window, then a table against the wall, away from the window. Finally, they did give us a window table and when we left 2 hours later, there was still another window table available. Not sure the reason for this action. In any case, once seating, we had a wonderful view, great service and food
5
We had dinner at Jaan last week and cannot say enough about it. I would given it more than 5 stars if possible. I will start with the view - simply incredible and worth a visit on its own. We would see the light show from Gardens by the Bay and Marina Sands from our table as well as all of the beautiful lights of Singapore. The food was amazing. In the top three meals we have ever had. Every dish was inventive and delicious. We had the 10 course tasting menu and when I found out that it did not include the "smoking" egg dish that I had heard about, the staff were kind enough to bring it out to me as an extra course. Loved the tomato dish in particular. The Chef himself served two of the courses which was a very nice touch. Kirk Westaway has big shoes to fill following the departure of Julien Royer, but he is doing a wonderful job and I after dining there I am confident that the world ranking of this restaurant is safe with Mr. Westaway. Simply a must while in Singapore
5
Perfect for romantic dates. The foods are delicious, the view outside is completely amazing esp during the nights. The chef served us our dessert and he's just super friendly...(and handsome as well). I would say this place is one of the best restaurants I've been to.
4
Some excellent flavours from the dishes (the pigeon perhaps the highlight) with creativity and presentation. The room is pretty sparce, apart from the ceiling - perhaps because the view from the 70th floor will overpower any wall decor? Some of the early dishes had subtler flavours than I prefer but they crescendo'd at the end. The French sommelier was a bit sour when stressed and didnt lighten up until things calmed down - that was the only negative. His wine pairings were excellent though. I would go again as I enjoyed the meal - but do ensure you bring your credit card, the prices are pretty steep
5
Have been here twice now and both times the experience was most enjoyable! It's a fantastic location on 70th floor of Swissotel. Great views especially stunning at night.The service is impeccable: pleasant friendly waiters and waitresses, attentive without being intrusive. The food: amazing! Unusual combinations and inventive presentations. Menu changes so the set menus were mostly different each time. But all fabby!The only thing is the exorbitant cost of the experience....
4
I have heard from many friends and review about Jaan and after such a long timex i have finally experience it myself. I'm most impressed with the chef's creativity in presenting the dishes and the robust flavours in each dish. Service was excellent and attentive. I would say they could do better in the restaurant deco and design Servic was
5
Dine here w my girlfriend. The food and the pairing wine all are very good. Very beautiful presentation plate by plate. Looks like an art each food. The view at 70th floor is also very nice. Rank 11th in 50 best restaurant in Asia. Trully a must try
5
We booked a table for dinner in the same day so we didn't had a table with a view, but that was ok. We had a great apetizer, a perfect main course, and an interesting dessert. The staff was very professional. It was a great experience and would highly recommend
5
My birthday celebration.singapore.amazing views lunch and family.foid exquisite.service exceptional.smoked organic egg.$78 3 course lunch plus 2 appetisers and bread.very good value.great wine and another birthday cake 😊
5
Put it shortly, the food is creative and original. Dessert was excellent. The Chef and his team know what they're doing and the service is up to the standard.
Great night.
5
The chef is an Englishman Kirk Westaway who is passionate about ingredients, food preparation and food presentation. The pigeon and the chocolate dessert were standouts in a very impressive tasting menu. Really fine food, a very good wine list and eyerie views.

Please don’t waste the time and money to go here. In fact skip all of Singapore’s high end places. Like many of them, this place is fussy and way over priced. All the little foams etc felt outdated and unnecessary. The service was so obsequious it was embarrassing. I went here a while ago for a special occasion. We weren’t near the window so the view was no bonus. I cannot recall a single thing I ate … and the bill was over $400 for 2, so you would hope it would be a least a bit memorable. There are so many great eating experiences available in Singapore, but this is not one of them
5
We had heard of Jaan and booked a table for the last night of our honeymoon in Singapore, we enjoyed a wonderful 7 course tasting menu with wine paring. The food was amazing, not your usual fine dining. Chef had pushed the boundaries and it worked well. We had a wonderful table by the window looking over Singapore by night from the 70th floor. The Chef came out for a chat, nice personal touch. Staff were great and looked after us, I would highly recommend for a special occasion. It is well worth pushing the boat out! Amazing all the way, we will go again when we return to Singapore

For my birthday recently, my husband booked Jaan which we have heard so much about but never got to try. When we eventually did, we were not disappointed and enjoyed the experience very much.Upon our arrival, I was delighted when they ushered us to the table by the window where we had the view of MBS. Fortunately, the ongoing hazy condition in Singapore did not completely block out the beautiful view before us - of MBS, the Spore flyer and the city skyline!We opted for the 7 course degustation menu which started off with the amuse bouche followed by the first course of the 7 which was lagoustine canneloni. Next was the heirloom tomato - loved it. The tomato was really fresh and there was a little burst of surprise to our taste buds - was told that it was basil sorbet (cold). Next up was the 55 minute rosemary organic egg - the way the food was presented was quite cute as it was served in egg cartons :-) Then came the scallop (different from what was mentioned in the menu) followed by the john dory. We decided not to go for the pigeon and Chef Kirk changed the dish into Wagyu beef for us. We absolutely enjoyed the wagyu which was cooked to perfection and just melted into our mouths. As we were not really into cheese and we were 90% full by then, we opted not to have the cheese selection (which carries an additional $35 supplement). There was a little cup of sorbet which was served prior to the The dessert which came next was a chocolate concoction and not the coconut grand cru as was stated on the menu. As it was my birthday, they presented us with a lovely little cake which we took home with us.Overall, it was a lovely experience although we felt that the service was a little rushed in the beginning. We also asked for the wine list and it took 3 tries before the list was presented. By then, they had already served the 2nd dish in the menu! Later on, however, Chef Kirk came out several times to present the dishes to us and the rest of the team were really attentive as well. That more than made up for the rushed beginning.If you are looking for a special evening out, Jaan is definitely the place but book in advance and hopefully, you will get that table with a view :-
5
I have lost count of the number times we tried getting reservations at Jaan but to no avail. Finally! Glad Jaan lived up to its reputation. My family really enjoyed our evening. Exquisite food with great service and even spectacular view of downtown Singapore. Highly recommended
5
My husband & I chose Jaan as our *final* meal in Singapore before moving overseas, and it did not disappoint! Everything from the detailed and timely reservation process, to the greeters and staff, to the elegantly presented and delicious food was impressive. And to top it off, when our waitress learned that this was our final meal in Singapore, she organized to have a special (to-die-for chocolate mousse) cake presented at the end with "Best Wishes" printed on top. We couldn't have asked for a better last meal.The decor itself is very simple, as to not detract from the stunning views over the city (the restaurant is on the 70th floor) or the presentation of the food. And what presentation! We chose the 3-course prixe-fix lunch, which when you add in all of the chef's appetizers, palate cleanser, and chocolates post-dessert, was more than enough food for us. Everything we tasted was exceptional in addition to appearing beautiful (see photos added) -- I can highly recommend the heirloom tomato dish which was the perfect balance of sweet and salty, and came with a delectable basil/pesto gelato
4
We celebrated our 25th anniversary here. We had a corner table with a view, which was great. We ordered five course menus, which were inventive and there was some molecule gastronomy and stellar presentation.The service was very good, with one rather major if: we asked for recommendation wines for the set menu and half glasses. We got the half servings, but were charged full price, "because the wines are so expensive". Otherwise a great experience
3
The "Jaan" has definitely prices which can be compared with the top gourmet restaurants but to reach satisfaction also with regards to price/performance ratio the the service and the ambience needs to be improved. This is where we have been disappointed. The food and menu was very delicious. The restaurant is placed in the 70th floor which is definitely a big plus - but turned into a big minus as though the restaurant offers an excellent view, the windows have been so dirty that one couldn't almost see anything. We also have been missing the wine offering which is a must for a gourmet menu (we needed to ask specifically for the wine menu after the courses already started instead of getting the proposal in the beginning). In addition we did not feel the same attention as we got in comparable restaurants (e.g. filling up mineral water, asking if everything's alright etc.)
4
High food quality and service standards with a great view of the city skyline, this is a very good dining experience all in all. Perfect for the special occasions when you want to impress - business meals or dinner dates.
5
On the 70th floor of the Swisshotel Stamford and the views, as expected, were exceptional. We could see the lights on the nearest Indonesian islands twinkling on the horizon! The dining room had a very eye catching ceiling with the stunning Murano crystal installations but I felt the that lower half was rather bland and lacked intimacy. Service was very attentive yet discreet without any hovering and someone was there when we needed something. But oh the food.......We all had the 7 course menu and I can't single out one course which was better than any other. Each plate that came out was very attractively presented and the contrast of flavours and textures was beautifully judged. If you enjoy fine dining or just simply having a great meal, Jaan is the best choice in SIngapore. Chef Kirk Westaway's talent is very impressive and given he's created such a fabulous restaurant at only 29, he will go on to even greater heights. Michelin judges take note - Jaan should be Singapore's first Michelin-starred reataurant
5
It is a gastronomical experience with so much pleasant surpriseAmbience - situated at 70th floor, it comes with great view overlooking Singapore skyline. Do book early if you prefer a window seatFood - Great -- every course is a statement of greatness. Details is given from the perspective of smell, taste, sight and feeling. The freshness of the ingredients speaks for itself in each course. all the flavours are great by themselves, and even greater when combined together. Excellent palette cleanser as pre dessert was served. Service - impeccable. Staff are well trained to explain and answer questions on the item in the menu. Each course is served with a good explanation on the ingredient and the way it is cooked.I appreciate that thoughts are put into every details the moment you step into Jaan right till the moment you leave with utmost satisfaction.It is the place to entertain, to impress and to pamper yoursel
5
Went there for our anniversary dinner. I can say this by far the one of the best fine dining restaurant we tried in Singapore. Their service is one of the best I ever experience dining in this country. The canapÃ©s was unique and tasty. We had the 7 course dinner and the food was cool to perfection. We were lucky enough to get the window seats which make this whole dinner even more perfect as we are able to enjoy our lovely dinner with a great view.
5
This is the best WOW factor western restaurant in Singapore. Besting even the likes of Joel Robuchon in Sentosa , and other celebrity restaurants that have popped up in Singapore and classics like the Raffles Grill. 1. Great view- Get a window side table!2. WOW signature dishes- Impressive dishes and presentation3. Excellent serviceOnly downside is the eye watering prices
5
Made reservation one month in advance and requested a window seating. Totally impressed by the interior ceiling decor, though simple table setting but with superb team of well-trained waiters and waitresses who can handle all different guests of all round of world. Lynn was very dedicated to attending to all my 5-course degustation menu, explaining patiently to all my queries professionally. What impressed me most is the food presentation, especially their signature 55" Rosemary smoked egg. This is very worth the trip to Singapore and worth the long wait on its reservation list. Will go again next yea
4
We had dinner at Jaan on the 31st July for our wedding anniversary. To begin, the experience with the staff at reservation was super professional. A lady named Patricia took my call, she had excellent phone manners and sent me a perfectly correct recap email promptly, with the menus.The dinner itself was excellent. We had the Prestige menu (7 course menu + amuse bouche and mignardises). The service was TOP notch. The staff was really professional, and while they might not have engaged as much as in some other restaurants we went to, they were pleasant and overall really nice. The new chef (he used to be the sous-chef before I believe) had already taken over and I was a bit disappointed to have missed the French chef by a few weeks, but their new man in charge is absolutely brilliant. I can't compare with the previous one since this was my first visit, but we were really satisfied. The dining room is gorgeous and the view is obviously magnificent. One remark though: we were initially sat at the tiny table immediately to the left. Luckily, a table near the window became available early enough and we could shift. While I was notified that we would not get a window table when I booked, I did not expect a table that small and in a corner either. I recommend to STOP using that table and that corner altogether. It is not fair to the customers who will pay the same price as everyone else and who will feel like they have been cheated. Overall the experience was great though. Highly recommended

We went here on a recent trip to Singapore and it was fabulous. It is a little different in that they just have set menus so you are very much in their hands. The food though, presented by the chef Kirk Westaway, was out of this world. Every course was very well presented without being pretentious and did not take away from the main event - the food. Not cheap but highly recommended and very good value for money

I've tried this restaurant several times for lunch and once for dinner and would recommend the lunch, but not the dinner. Why? The food is almost the same, but the price is completely different. The set lunch is outstanding and would definitely qualify as excellent with innovative and delicious courses, multiple amuse bouches and "extras" which add up to a memorable and outstanding occasion. Don't rush it - it takes time to get the best out of the lunch. When I went for dinner I was disappointed because quite a number of the dishes were the same as those served for lunches, but the dinner menu prices, when loaded with the extras, are very ambitious - our dinner with matching recommended wines was over $1000 for 2. For that money I expect perfection and in this case the wine pairings let it down a little bit - the wines were not served at the correct times with the food so the pairings slipped (paired wine coming 5 minutes after food, for example) and compared with other real top quality restaurants (which I would classify Jaan as), the pairings were quite uninspiring (and expensive - $28++ for a taste of Muscadet??). However, the food is really special, the view is good and the service is generally good too. Go for lunch and enjoy the experience for about a third of the price of dinner

I had such high expectations of Jaan having read the reviews but everything bar the wine selection was a complete let down. You know it's going to be one of the most expensive night outs in Singapore & as it was my birthday i decided it was worth it. It wasn't.The service was surprisingly poor. Everything from the lack of personalisation considering they knew it was my birthday no one mentioned it & there was no artistic cake or even candles right down to basics like having to ask for more bread, water & getting the wrong cutlery for certain courses. Not what was expected at this level restaurant.The biggest surprise was the lack of any wow in the food. It was ok but bland, nothing especially creative or interesting no wow flavours. We had the 10 course degustation menu plus cheese & for that i wanted wow factors. There were none. We even had to send several courses back.Even more disappointing was that we never saw the chef even though he was there & he visited other tables. Considering it was my birthday & we had sent courses back i would have expected him to come & talk to us. This showed a lack of care & professionalism & over inflated view of the experience. Even the layout & decor was poor. Ok if you got front seats of Marina Bay as we did but for those squeezed in behind us all they got was our heads & a lack of privacy.The only shining light was the sommelier who gave excellent service & fantastic wines with every course. He was amazing & put all the other staff to shame.Won't be returning & would advise you to think twice. Joel Robouchon is a higher quality restaurant all round if you want French fine dining.Jaan is massively overrated
5
Wonderful ambience, great views. Reservations essential because of limited seating. Take time for the complete experience. Anything you order will be great. BUT chef Julie Royer is moving on.
3
The view is spectacular. Service was greatly executed by the staffs. Food was tasty but very expensive and common taste only. No reason to go back except for the view.
5
If people call Jaan a good dining experience, I think the good just got better. The level of dining I experienced was not one that comes by everyday. From a Michelin perspective an easy 2 stars which is very close to a solid 3. Dish after dish, JH and I both commended the thought that was presented with each course. From the pigeon smoked in hay to the beetroot collection and even more so with the ham,pea and eggs, these were simple yet enjoyable pleasures! The execution of each course was flawless and the presentation was made artistic. My only disappointment was the course of AMADAI fish which clearly showed that just because it looked great does not mean it taste great. But then comes the humble bird which was Chef Julien's favourite which and it absolutely sealed the deal at Jaan. Dining with such food on the 72nd floor also made it feel as though you were dining in heaven. This brings back good memories of me dining in Sepia, Sydney and Le Atelier de Joel Robuchon. Happy days! To Chef Julien and his crew, thank you.Full post on http://wenywonderswhy.blogspot.com.au/2015/07/singapore-modern-french-dining-above.htm

The complete package, service and food of a higher starred Michelin standard, add a spectacular view and a romantic dining room and this has to be one of Asia's best dining venues. I have returned her before just for the truffled brie, oh how the simple things in life can be so decadent and so good
5
I take my food very seriously.. so much so that my behaviour is governed by the food I eat.. I either eat or think about it... so if you are passionate about food and if you want awesome view along with it....Go to Jaan... its is indeed one of the most awesome restaurants that I have been to lately and honestly now I understand why they are ranked 74th Best in the World & 11th Best in Asia.The food is elegant, visually stunning & mindblastingly delicious and along with the view... I was in food heaven!! Must visit & strongly recommend to book in advance as its a 40 seat restaurant & is hugely popular. Cant wait to go back there... (I am actually drooling while writing this review
5
this is a long overdue review. i've been to JAAN only once, with a good friend of mine. and amongst the (rare) really posh dining experience i've had so far, i would say JAAN was the BEST. i seriously enjoyed the 7-course dinner menu with wine pairing. it was definitely an unforgettable experience. the service was excellent. the view spectacular. and the food - divine
5
I've eaten here on several occasion with my colleagues under company's pay check. For fine dining, it is really amazing. You get a fantastic view up on the 82nd level. Even though the servings seem small, but it definitely filled our stomachs. I loved the desserts
5
Jaan is an intimate restaurant to celebrate any special occasion, and the view is fantastic on a clear day. My wife chose the degustation lunch menu, and i went for the gourmand lunch menu, and we were treated to a wonderful 5 course sensory experience. The service is exemplary
5
Jaan was the first fine dining experience for me in Singapore as my first Singapore visit. I took Degustation Lunch which was so good. The 55 degree onsen egg was nice, venison was perfectly cooked, dessert was decent, chocolate grand cru. The service was very well done. And the best for this place should be its view. They offered the best view in town, view of the bay and the skyscraper line in the city
5
Exceptional service by the staff. They know when to approach you and when not to. Also, every single dish was explained.The View? Simply amazing, they gave us a corner table overlooking the Marina Bay area and Singapore flyer. Atmosphere was also extremely good, as there were only 7-8 tables within the restaurant. Ideal for couples.The food? Spectacularly PERFECT... and Great wine selection...P.S. Special thanks for giving us a "Happy Anniversary" cak
5
Jaan has never failed to deliver. THe food is very good, and unique, the serving plates are of the most unusual shape and quality. The food decor is amazing. It is almost like a piece of art. The service is fantastic..
3
I returned to this restaurant after 4 years and was a little disappointed. More so with the service, not the food......couple of wines that I asked for was not available..,,,delay in serving the second course and staff attitude was terrible.
5
One of the best meals I have had globally. Quite incredible! Make sure you go upstairs to the super exclusive bar upstairs for a drink after dinner!
5
Loved the food, the staff were really friendly and efficient, and did i mention the view. It deserves its reputation as one of the best restaurants around. It not cheap though, so budget $400-600 per person with wine.Jaan is a french restaurant and offers a range of degustation menus with the option to match wine. It includes a number of extra courses to supplement the menu including amuse bouches, pre-dessert and petit fours. There is a vegetarian option.Its a small room of about 12 tables, with about half along the floor to ceiling glass on the 70th floor of the Swissotel Stamford Hotel
5
Dinner at Jaan was an exceptional experience. Where to start ! The service was perfect! The cuisine was creative, delicious and exquisitely presented. The wines paired beautifully with the cuisine. The view of Singapore from the 70th floor was amazing. The added fireworks over the harbor was a delight!I have dined around the world at the finest restaurants. Jaan is one of them.I can't wait to return 
4
This is a good restaurant in a really poor space. It is a strange shape, with a feel of a pre-fabricated, temporary room. As a result, it really lacks atmosphere. Service was good but maybe lacked charm. The chef deserves his good reviews, although I hear he is leaving to open a new place.
3
The food at Jaan is of very high quality, the service is ok. Pricing is as to be expected. Biggest frustration is all the tables seem to be for x4-6 people and should you visit as a couple they will just remove x2 chairs, it doesn't feel very intimate. The restaurant just has a very business lunch feel about it. Visit les amis the prices are more reasonable, the service is better and the quality of food equal
5
If you're planning for one hell of a culinary experience come to Jaan! Another solo dining trip on my of my weekend vacations to SG from Perth which I would gladly repeat.Had the 7 course meal, which was more like 10 with the other small tasters. Most memorable dish by far has to be the rosemary smoked organic egg, which is something that every human has to try in order to eggsperience heaven (get it :P
5
Take it from me, it is as what the title says. Don't believe what other guide says. (I've ate them all)The overall lunch experience was much better than some hongkong 3 michelin stars and NYC 2 stars i've had. The cep sabayon and pigeon dishes were the absolute standouts, just perfect.Amadai with thai sauce/curry(?)(curry wasn't the term used to describe it but i forgot the specifics) was perhaps the most perfectly cooked fish i've ever had. Only other place that did it this well was Le Bernardin NYC. Although i must say i would have liked it even better if the sauce wasn't that strong, overpowering the delicate flavours of amadai.In general flavours were clean, focused and robust. Desserts a balance of strong and light. Excellent! With a new chef at the helm, i am personally very excited to see what's next in store

We make a last minute reservation so we get a table slightly away from the window. I was very glad that the manager move us to a table close the the window before the meal commence. I like his.comment that he wished his guest will be able the enjoy and have a better experience. So thoughtful of him. The view is spectacular so it meant a lot for us.We selected the 5 course lunch costing S$118 and I think it's good value for money taking into consideration the ambience, the food, the presentations and the service.We have lamb as our main dish which is cooked in different ways serve in small portions on a plate. Taste good with a glass of wine.I can't remember what they name of the dish that top up with a poach egg. It's the best and taste fantastic. I had it in video and it's a pity it cannot be show here as the presentation is unforgettable with dry ice melting and misty vision on the food and table.Mushroom soup was served in a cup and my goodness how I wish I could have bigger cup or BOWL! Ha ha.Overall I enjoyed the lunch thanks to my Daugherty who brought me there
5
Had the 3 course lunch but was really a 7 course considering the amuse bouche, bread, petit fours on offer.. Wonderful, artistic presentation, top-notch service and cutlery (ask the background story of the steak knives). Left totally full, impressed and already planning a return visit!
4
a 3 coures meal for 78 is great value for money, the view from the top of swissotel is great too, but the food is not as good as for example at Andre´s. wines by glass start at 30$, as usual in Singapore...
5
Amazing food, fantastic service.
Expensive, but worth it for the experience.
Every dish blew us away with amazing flavours and textures.
4
The food and wine list are of the highest standard, but the prices are stratospheric! The degustation menu does not include wine, you may be offered an
5
on a recent business trip to Singapore a contact booked a table for three of us at Jaan, on the 70th floor of the Swisshotel building in Singapore. The views are STAGGERING - it was evening so dark and we looked down onto the Marina and over to the CBD and out to the shipping lanes and WOW what views. Then we ordered and our host opted for the 7 course meal so that was for all of us but I am vegetarian so had the veggie options as alternatives - each of which were wonderful. Not really 7 but more like 10 courses as free extras were brought but each was modest and at the end one felt replete not stuffed and uncomfortable. Each course was explained and served with a smile and flourish. It really was like a dramatic performance in which the stars were the food on the plates and the guests were to eat and savour the flavours, almost forgetting the views out of the windows!If you have a big enough budget for the meal, try this amazing evening experience - I shall be amazed if you come away disappointed at the food or the service or the location and set up of the tables and chairs and space
5
One of the best meals I have ever had. Also one of the most expensive. The hotel concierge managed to get us one of the best tables in the house, overlooking the Marina Bay Sands resort, and catching the laser show.It was a 7 course meal, with three chefs extra courses.Portion size was small, but enough. And the flavour was simply phenomenal.Coupled with a good, and less expensive red than Recommended by the sommelier, it was a truly gourmand experience. A three hour meal that was fabulous.Recommended, but don't try and go cheap. Enjoy the experience
5
We had a great dining experience in jaan when we visited it for lunch The menu was limited to a set of vegetarian or no vegetarian. As there was not much choice we settled for the sets. The presentation of the food and the taste was very good. The chef was I must say very creative with the way he managed his ingredients. We had beetroot done different ways in a dish. That was great. The lamb was divine. So tender and juicy. The desserts were just right. Not too sweet and so many variations. Although at first portions did look small the whole dining experience would satisfy our palate. But don't expect to feel very full For us it was just nice.Thank you for a great dining experience The only thing I would like to suggest would be more smiles and a less clinical like presentation of the food by the waiters and perhaps with more warmth and enthusiasm
5
This is a unique and interesting restaurant that does not disappoint on creative dishes. Overall everything was excellent and well prepared. Every dish was inventive and most create curiosity on how it was prepared. You could call it over the top but everything tasted very good. Service was excellent and the view is very nice. I would recommend this restaurant if you something different and creative but also very good
4
We enjoyed a nice evening dinner at Jaan. The view is superb. The table setting precise with Coquelet porcelaine. Discreet and efficient service. We took the seven plates menu. The appetizers were well choosen going from Caviar and chou-fleur mouseline to colorful veggy salad with burrata and macaron. Egg yoke with ham on smoky plate.The main plates went from sea with a splendid fish to a very well prepared pigeon... The chocolate dessert is a success. We will definitely go back.+ nice selection of win
5
I cannot name one little negative comment about the whole dinning experience. From online email booking communication to reception and seating to the great food taste and presentation and great attentive but not intrusive service. I had the seven course menu (see picture) which was priced at SGD 240 which I thought was really reasonable comparing to other Michelin-stared restaurants. The food is served with such picturesque presentation that you almost don't want to ruin it by eating it. The taste is even better - loved the quail and fish in my menu. The portion was just right even each dish was small quantity but after seven dishes you get quite full. The chocolate dessert was out of this world as they had put different chocolate textures together. If you want a window seat you'll have to book at least one month in advance. It is a small private restaurant with only a few window tables. I would definitely come back and bring my out of town guests here to impress them
5
Amazing location on top of the Swisshotel, amazing food. You can choose one of the menus which are served by experienced staff. The chef creates spectacular dishes for starters and desserts, being able to create unique plates. Would definitely reccomend it.
4
I had my early birthday celebration here. Highly recommended to people like good ambience, food are so artistic. The restaurant provide more than 5 star service. Bravo singapore! !
5
Good Ambience; Good presentation and equally good food. Probably best French food in town; must try;
5
Firstly, service staff is obviously very well trained. Attentive, friendly and knowledgeable. Food is spectacular with great flavor pairing. Loved the mushroom tea and hay roasted pigeon. The winter garden dish was beautiful and engaging with the different preparations of delicious vegetables. We will be back for the next season.
5
We managed to get a window table and the view was very nice overlooking the Boat Quay, Clark Quay and river. Food is excellent, inventive and artistically displayed. A pleasure! However, we were not too pleased with the service. The waitress was friendly but not well trained. She came 3 times to rush us for the order during lunch time which was totally unacceptable and unnecessary. Before I finished the coffee at around 2, she came and cleared our table while I still had half a cup of coffee left. There were still 3 tables eating and I did not understand why she had to do that.The restaurant may look nicer in the evening but during day time, it does not impress at all.I will go back for the view and the excellent food
5
I have been to Jaan restaurant many times over the past few years and that restaurant has gone from strength to strength. The current team headed by Chef Julien and by Frank, the Maitre d'hÃ´tel, is doing a stellar job. The views are of course nice from there, Singapore has always been a beautiful city to look at. But the service is spot on, very friendly and remembers guest preferences to the letter. And the food is, in my own opinion, mind blowing. Fresh, tasty and impeccably presented and served. We will definitely be back when in town next time
1
I called to make a reservation here. The person on the phone sounds like a high school principal, who treats you like a little boy. They can not confirm the reservation until you send them a form with a credit card authorization. To me that is unacceptable treatment of a potential patron. If they think they are so god like that they can treat people like this, I will find another nice restaurant to enjoy my dinner. Simply incredible
5
I wish I had paid more attention at the time so that I could write a more detailed review but suffice to say that, having eaten at some pretty spectacular places all over the world, this was one of the best. I booked online in advance (efficient and easy) and as it was my first trip to Singapore had requested a good table. Don't be disheartened by the rather mediocre entrance via the hotel, this place is amazing. We were seated right at a window overlooking Singapore harbour in all its night time glory. The ambience was sophisticated and indulgent and the service was immaculate. We had the 7 course Prestige menu which was fabulous. It is, understandably, not cheap but well worth it
5
Jaan offers diners a view over much of Singapore's downtown area and business district which is pretty spectacular. The food exceeds the view. Chef Julien Royer has done a marvellous job crafting a menu which you can only rave about. The service under the careful eye of Maitre d' Frank Philippe is superb. A very special night out in Singapore was made more special by the wonderful food and service we enjoyed
5
First it is the stunning view but the food was equally amazing. We chose the menu "carte blanche" so every dish was a surprise...and we had a blast, the cuisine is imaginative, playful, interactive and yet delicious. The staff was very attentive and friendly. No wonder this place is climbing up in Asia's list of best restaurants
4
this restaurant is located at 70th floor .... u can have a good view of singapore city...... very nice atmosphere there....food ok
5
I had an unforgettable dinner at this restaurant. Good fancy french food at 70th floor. Fancy food I called cos it was so pretty to look at yet the taste also very good. The maitre' d would explain every plate of food that was served in details, but unfortunately most of us didn't know what was that. Well, they also have different wine for every plate served for a S$130 ++. By the way, the menu was dated so presumably it would be changed everyday
5
I have nothing to say about the view. Dining at 70th floor on Vday was really great!I really like their special dinnerware and cutlery, as well as their food decoration ideas: creative, but simple and elegant. Food is nice. Not really delicious but OK. We are really satisfy with the service and atmosphere. Good choice for celebrating special occasions
5
Best Meal in my life. I have been to several degustation type places and this was the absolute best. Each course had different textures and flavors. The pigeon two-ways was the most moist meat I have ever eaten. Ordered the 7 course meal, which had bread, amuse bouche, and other palate cleansers on top of those 7. Wish wasn't so full by the 3 course as the last few courses got even better
5
Spent a lovely evening there with my husband to celebrate our anniversary. The view from our table was lovely as we could take in the entire city skyline and the service rendered was also attentive and immaculate. Thoroughly enjoyed the food and wine, much thought was put into the presentation for each dish. Will definitely come back again for a special occasion.
5
My husband took me here for my birthday lunch. This was our second visit here but the first one after Chef Julien Royer took over. The dining room is beautifully uncluttered and showcases only one thing - the fantastic view of the island as far as the eye can see! The hubs had made reservations many days in advance and got us a lovely table by the window. We had the five course tasting menu and everything was not just visually appealing but tasted as beautiful. The dished in particular that stood out were:mushroom tea: wonderful, complex, earthy flavour that somehow warmed your soul!rosemary smoked egg: perfectly cooked with black truffle chips adding a contrast in texture and tastepalate cleansing granita: right before the dessert - it was refreshing, lemony and prepped our palates for the next courseThe best bit about the meal - we left the kids with the nanny!Tip - The 5 course lunch menu is great value at 118 before the extras. Also, vegetarians rejoice - they have a special 5 course tasting menu which is fabulous
3
We were really looking forward to dinner at Jaan Restaurant. We were very disappointed by the food. It was lovely presentation and looked beautiful to eat but it was boring. The flavor of the dishes was repetitive, waiters precise and diligent, but i thought of eating a lot better.On a more positive note, the view from the restaurant is without parallel one of the best in Singapore...but not enough!!
5
Phenomenal experience from the time we stepped from the elevator. 70floors up the view is breathtaking but the food....fantastic! Five courses(8 if you include the amuse bouche,the gelato palate cleanser and petit fours) of world class flavours and fresh produce. The service was excellent, knowledgeable staff who were friendly without being fake. The maÃ®tre de was exceptional. This restaurant was brilliant. Spend the money and experience this gem
5
Wouah!! It has been a long time... Actually I don't remember when it was.... Perfect view, perfect meals, perfect service....If you are ready to forget about money and spoil yourself, yes, have a dinner at Jaan, enjoy your 5, 7 or 10 courses, do the wine pairing, sip a glass of champagne staring at the view, enjoy the passion of the sommelier, the love for gastronomy of the talented Chef, make the most of every minute spent with the one(s) who will be lucky enough to share this moment with you....Almost perfect ?! Well for this amount of money you can expect perfection... The only little thing I am going to say is the the Chef likes Rosemary... Too much maybe ? We had Rosemary with pigeon and Rosemary with egg - both delicious! As a pre-dessert, was a little chocolate Rosemary nibble - also very good but this extra one made me think "too much Rosemary!". Well, this is just to say something...Oh and I almost forgot ; the best chocolate desert of my life !Definitively worth waiting ages to have a table, and just forget about all the others restaurants: if you need to pick one for a special occasion: this is THE one !
5
I come here for lunch with 3 others for a special occasion in Jan 2015. I went with a very high its steep price for lunch and the great reviews in trip advisor and hungrygowhere.We ordered the 7 course set lunch. Every course is so well presented. Taste is great with high quality ingredients. It's really amazing how something as simple and common as an egg (which we eat at home a few times a week) can be so innovative my cooked and served.What impressed me most is that a 7-course meal has more than 7 courses! There are light dishes between courses served to clear our palate for the next course.The pigeon steak is one of its kind. Well, it's my first pigeon steak ever! I doubt you'll get it anywhere else in Singapore, certainly not as well cooked. A few photos will speak dozen words. Check out the photos.Pro: amazing food, fantastic viewCon: the place is too small so slightly hard to make reservationPrice: spent around $200 including GS
5
If it is a romantic dinner, go there, it it is business, go there, it is just to spoil yourself, go there.. GO THERE..
5
One of the best dinners I've ever had! We had the 10 dish tasting menu. The artisanal cuisine stunned me. It was perfectly perfect in every way!

http://missneverfull.com/?p=811
Stunning view from 70F. Most importantly, the food was amazing.
MUST try 55’ ROSEMARY SMOKED ORGANIC EGG!!
5
French cuisine, Vegetarian 6 course menu most of the chefs would be giving up. Jaan was altogether a different meal experience! Each course was getting better and spoke volume about the culinary team! We enjoyed and have been cherishing it!!!!!

Jaan has always intrigued me. You need a reservation it seems if you want to dine there. But the restaurant always appeared gem like amidst the fair ground atmosphere that is the Equinox complex on top of the Swisshotel Stamford. Decor-wise, if not for the stunning view, the room seems a tad cold & impersonal for a comfortable dining experience. Service is cool, efficient but not really warm, verging on the mechanical.The star is really the cooking of Chef Julian Royer. Hailing from a family of famers, Chef Royer offers his take on artisanal cuisine. It is accomplished, well cooked & flawlessly plated. Any of the menus on offer will be a wonderful introduction. I went for lunch & opted for the 7 course chef's surprise menu. Standouts were the Beetroot Collection, the 55 degree cooked egg, the line caught fish with rouille sauce, the wagyu beef with kale and truffle coulis. Excellent bread which is the hallmark of a fine restaurant was served with unsalted butter as well as excellent mignardises or petit fours which came with coffee. The down side? It didn't feel like value for money. With a bottle of water and a glass of champagne along with an additional supplement for a sliver of truffle brie with salad and poilane bread set me back SGD $298, which is a hefty sum to pay for lunch. While I admire the chef, it would be hard put to say when I would be back. It was the kind of nuturing environment with gorgeous food I'd return to again and again. Go for the experience but choose wisely
4
This restaurant was recommended to us by a colleague and it really met the expectations.It is located on top of the Swissotel (we were not staying there though) and has an exquisite choice of french style cuisine.Starting with a very good glass of champaign, we had the foie gras which was excellently cooked and very tasty. The meat was top but not wow. the desert was a mixture of everything on the menu and was a delight.Definitely a place not to skip when in Singapore
5
We booked lunch at the Jaan restaurant and think it was one of the best meals we've had! It is fantastic.From the amuse bouche to the delicious coffee and after lunch petit fours, the whole experience was sublime. I cannot praise this restaurant highly enough.The pre lunch amuse bouche, the mushroom 'soup', the beetroot and fois gras starters, the trout and venison along with the choc nut and pear desserts were all fab. Brilliant tastes, innovative, creative,mfantastic ingredients, well balanced and well paced. Every dish was faultless. So much care and attention has gone into every dish. There is a touch of theatre before and after dinner but it is for a reason - it tastes delicious and not just for show.Service was excellent too. To be greeted at the door by name - wow - and all the waiters were friendly and helpful. Not stuffy or starchy here!To add to all this - views of Singapore.We gave been very fortunate to have eaten in some wonderful restaurants in many cities across the world and this lunch rates at one of the best. Worth every penny in memories alone
5
I have had meals at Jaan for several occasions, and each time is just an experience more memorable than the other. View of this restaurant is simply spectacular. The food are definitely not just nice to look at, they taste even better than they look! The presentation of each course by the lovely wait staffs speaks of the effort behind the dishes. Each course is just so intricate and well balanced with flavours of different components going so well together. The bespoke service, so sleek and yet personal, is another point not to be forgotten. The wine pairing goes so well with all the courses, there is really nothing to fault. Although this is not the cheapest place to be at, but it's definitely worth every single penny spent.
5
It's my 3rd time in Jaan, and they always surprise me. so much work done in the kitchen from the first bite (amuse bouche) to the last petit fours.Congrats to the chef and his team.Service is perfect too, attention to details, i am a left handed so they set my cutlery with the knife on the left, those are little details, but there is plenty of them, and that make the differenceTruly of of the best in Singapore.And of course the best view of Singapor
2
Came to Jaan second time in 3 months for a business lunch. Menu is the same which can be forgiven. However, waitress was in a hurry because it was busy. There is really no time to answer questions on the menu. An example being,"Would the 5 course take more than an hour to cpmplete vs the 3 course" Answer would be "Can I get you some water first". Next moment she turned and rushed off to another table cos I took more than 3 s to reply. She rushed back after 5 mins and said "have you decided? and to answer your question, how long it takes depend on how long you take to eat". Seriously, most business lunch probably have a fixed time. Ordered the 3 course. Main took a long time to arrive despite some of the guest having time constraint. After an hour, one of the guest has to leave and main course could not be served on time. We understand its an upclass restaurant but surely you can tweak the timing a little. Service and food were not great and my guest didnt get to try the main course after an hour. Amuse bouche is probably to give time for the chef to cope with the large crowd. will not return again
5
For our second visit to Jaan's, for Christmas Eve, the kitchen and staff surpassed our expectations. The food amazing- the flavors, ingredients, presentation and combinations incredible. Each mouth full an explosion of flavors and textures.
4
Amazing view from the 70th floor of Swissotel the Stamford. Impressive set up, impressive food, just lacking of a WOW factor when you pay such a high price.

If you have never seen the skyline of Singapore from above or if you are easily charmed by the appearance of what you eat, then this place is for you. Oh yes, one more thing, you must also be willing to pay for both. Unfortunately, I am not one of those people. I enjoyed a good view, but I was staying at Marina Bay Sands already, so the sight from Jaan, while spectacular, did not stun me. I too enjoyed the visual aspect of food presentation, but I also adamantly believe the most important point in fine dinning is the taste of the food, and that’s what I found lacking in Jaan’s preparation. We, a party of three, had the 7-course meal, and I found every course delightful to look at but nothing exciting to my palate. Furthermore, each course was only bite-size, and we felt we had only finished the appetizers after going through all of them. If it was not because the desserts were unexpectedly filling, we would have gone to Lay Pa Sat nearby for satays to complete our dinning affair. Some people equate French fare with fancy minimalist cooking and that’s a travesty to French cuisines.In the end, it is difficult to rate Jaan because the environment and atmosphere are definitely above average, but it does not meet my expectation in the most important category, so in balance I rated it average

One of the best views from the restaurant ever! Accompanied with wonderful and imaginative french dishes. Wines were selected to beautifully compliment the food. Reason for only three stars in my review comes from the fact that prices were so very high and in the city with all possible delightful food and eating possible it's just so hard to judge the best place to eat.

Located on level 70 of the Swissotel Stamford at Raffles PlaceIf you go for lunch it is a set menu of 3, 5 or 7 dishes and at good prices for the quality of the food. The food is exquisite and the preparation, presentation and explanation before each course is wonderful.Every time I go to Singapore I make it a must to dine here for the food

Had the 5 course taster here at the start of November which was outstanding. Lovely intimate dining room with that amazing view (however the other restaurant has the best view, annoyingly!)Fabulous staff; attentive, warm and passionate about the menu.Delicious and innovative food. Stand out course for me (because the veg course can be a slight disappointment) was the Autumn salad. My goodness! Stunning and intense flavours from a vegetable dish is a remarkable achievement and was executed perfectly, outstanding.For a special treat or just because, add Jaan to your 'to do list'Loved it looking forward to a repeat visit when back in Singapore

Jaan is definitely THE place for special occasions IMO. They have various set meals to choose from, to suit anyone's taste and budget (but don't expect budget meals). Enjoyed the food and presentation was very nice, so nice it was a waste to actually eat it. Service and ambiance is top notch; with breathtaking view.Highly recommended place for special occasions

This is a retrospective review, as our dinner was in May 2014 when we were in town for a conference. However, the impression made at the time was so strong that I just have to leave a review.My wife and I enjoy our food (from street food, casual restaurant to fine dining) but by no mean snobby foodies. We were excited at the prospect of visiting Singapore which is well known to be a food mecca in SE Asia, and we decided to have a fine-dining session while we were in the city for 4 days. After much research, we settled on Jaan with a degustation menu.To save some of you time, I will get to the conclusion first, and for those who want a bit more details can read on. I left the restaurant utterly disappointed with the service and the lacklustre food presented. The failings were made worse when we had to pay for what was the most expensive meal we ever had for 2. It was an EPIC fail.The good1) The view, as mentioned many times, is top notch, but only if you are seated next the window though. But the restaurant is small enough that you still ended up with some sort of view regardless of where you are seated.Unfortunately, the view was the only good aspect about Jaan.The bad1) Food- This is well known to be one of the top restaurants in Singapore and Asia, so we arrived with great expectation of an exquisite culinary experience. We opted for a 10-course degustation menu as we wanted to sample their best, and we don't do fine-dining very often so we wanted to maximise our experience.Each course was well presented, with good use of natural colours of ingredients to enhance visual appeal. Unfortunately, the flavours were lacking in ALL courses. I mean, all dishes were BLAND!!! There was not even hints of subtleties. Seafood and meat proteins cooking skills were average at best, and it was a crime to destroy so many fine ingredients!!! 2) Service- we had trouble understanding what most waiting staff were saying for the entire night, they mumbled when they presented the dishes and we had no idea (apart from the obvious) what we were eating as the menu had been taken away as well. It's absurd that in a top notch restaurant and a country where English is spoken commonly as first tongue cannot hire staff who can speak English clearly. I'm NOT being a racist (being of Asian descent myself) and this is not about accent, it's about not being confident in English and mumbling simple words to get by. At least the Maitre d' who speaks with an French/ Germanic accent we could understand, but he wasn't the one who presented dishes and knowing what you are eating is a big part of degustation experience!!! It's the responsibility of the restaurant to hire appropriate staff, and at the prices they expect people to pay, they should be able to hire top quality staff!!!We compared this meal to our previous Michellin 1 star dining experience in UK which costed us a third of the price we paid at Jaan, but the experience then in terms of food was a gastronomic explosion; taste buds were left buzzing and yearning for more. The experience at Jaan, sadly as the title had suggested, was a massive disappointment to say the least, esp the quality of the food served. Top prices were paid, for a meal that could easily be beaten by a good local restaurant

Came here for some good food before my special day.All I can say is that, every food served on the table has their surprise element. We went there for lunch and was met by very friendly staff since we walked in. Although, I have a slightly hard time trying to hear what my head waiter was trying to say about the menu. His accent is pretty strong. Maybe its just me. :) We chose 3 & 4 course degustation. I specifically asked if there's anything raw on the menu (which I cant take back then). I was told nothing was raw. I ended up having a soft boiled egg for my dish. This was somewhat disappointing as I couldn't take raw eggs (not even soft boiled).. ended up it was in my partner's stomach. Well, according to the waiter at my table.. he said its not raw.. I can't help but cringe.Ambience at the restaurant overlooking the Singapore skyline.. is definitely great!Worth a visit if you haven't been there
5
We could not have picked a better Restaurant for such a occasion, as celebrating Christmas Eve. It has been our 2nd visit, needless to say, why we choose again this place. Terrific view over parts of the city from the 70th floor; perfect service; the Restaurant is not crowded with tables and the food by itself hard for other Restaurateurs to beat. Every single dish is a surprise in taste, quality, invention, display which comes always with a different theme and china! Just great for gourmets! It is not your daily Restaurant to go there or even to try to copy at home! Yes it has got a price tag, but one of these rare places, which you do not regret afterwards!
5
Everything about the dinning experience is Jaan is perfect. The view is stunning. You can get one of the best view at Jaan in Singapore. The food was unbelievable. The perfect balance between creativity and taste. It is going to be one of my most frequented restaurants in Singapore
5
I've been to JAAN recently and must say I am overwhelmed by the standard of this restaurant.THE VIEW: We were seated in the corner of the pretty small restaurant and overlooked the flyer and the marina bay area. Absolutely stunning, especially that night was very clear and we could see very far.THE AMBIENCE: Nice and cosy atmosphere with minimalistic setting, the walls look pretty empty though.. but the view makes it up I guess.THE SERVICE: We were greeted and hosted by the charming Austrian Maitre D' who absolutely knew what he is doing, from the seating to recommending drinks and menu until the lovely goodbye everything was 5 star service. We even had nice chats about other restaurants in other countries which he knew straight away, pretty rare for his young age! The dishes were presented by lovely waitresses who are very knowledgeable and sweet!THE FOOD: What should I say.. incredible, top notch, best I've ever experienced...Such an extraordinary level of details Chef Julien is putting into his creations without being over pretentious or confusing.. All the textures and seasoning were done perfectly well.Standing out was the Garden composition with truffles as well as the rosemary smoked egg, which brings a lot of drama of the table (in a good way :)) It is very hard to find a balance in 10 different dishes that, when you fininsh with the meal, you are perfectly satisfied with portions and mixture.Overall it was the best experience so far in a fine dining restaurant and I absolutely recommend JAAN for a special night out. It is pretty pricey though but what you get is worth it
5
You can't go wrong ordering a la carte or going for the degustation menu. The food has been consistently good and the presentation amazing. The service staff has always been welcoming, though we did have to ask them to move the cheese trolley....Coupled with a beautiful panoramic view of Singapore, it is one of Singapore's top restaurants to visit

My wife and I stopped by Singapore on our way back from the Maldives on our Honeymoon, and we wanted something special and heard good things about Jaan. We've travelled a little bit, and have eaten at some really great restaurants, so were really looking forward to this.We had the 7 course set menu, which included a beetroot-7-ways dish, 65degree egg, wagyu fillet. The beetroot dish was nice, but who eats beetroot jelly and foam and sorbet? The wagyu fillet was the standout dish.The service was good, and the ambience was great. I really liked the Venetian glass light fittings (which would've cost a fortune!), and the view of Marina Bay Sands.But ultimately, the price was far too much for what it was. In comparison to other restaurants where you get similar food and experiences
4
This is a retrospective review.I have dined here on 2 occasions. Once in 2012 and then in 2013.My first experience at Jaan in 2012 was absolutely mind-blowing. The guest chef was around and he produced a phenomenal menu of dishes. Up till today, I still think fondly of his gnocchi. The gooey texture that just melted right upon tasting was absolutely unique.My second dining experience at Jaan in 2013 failed to live up to the expectations I had since 2012. The menu was lacking in progression. While the presentation of the dishes were nice (eg the use of dry ice made a very dramatic dish), the flavours needed an extra oomph.I have also recently dined at Narisawa (Tokyo) and Quintessence (Tokyo). In contrast to these Michelin- starred establishments, I would say Jaan still has to work upon its flavours, and the culinary journey to bring its diners along
5
One needs not wonder why Jaan is recognized as one of the best fine dining restaurants in the world. One nov 1st I had the true pleasure of enjoying a 10 course meal served by the pleasant, professional staff at Jaan. Our server Kathy always carrying a smile gracefully explained every intricate dish. The engaging sommelier Isabelle did not miss a beat, always a step ahead of the next course, she would delightfully introduced and explained the next wine. An exciting moment for us was when Chef Julien presented us a course. I would like to extend compliments to chef Julien for his creativity and elaborate detail to his dishes. Without question, I'll be back on my next trip!Nicol

Despite having to run the gauntlet of greeters (at least 3, each of whom asked if we had reservations) before being seated, we found the food to be superb. The sommelier was excellent. We had the 5 course dinner and wine pairings. It was a lot of food and even more wine, but it could not have been better. It is VERY expensive
5
We visited Singapore for a special Anniversary and wanted somewhere with new and creative flavours to celebrate. Taking advice from other reviewers, we decided that we had to experience this Modern French cuisine in Singapore and booked our table. Firstly, making a reservation is daunting as credit card details and a scanned copy of the credit card was requested before confirmation of the booking could be made. As we were travelling at the time, this condition was difficult but a quick email guaranteeing our commitment was accepted.The restaurant is small and intimate with sophisticated lighting and the view of the Singapore skyline, magical. Our choice of the seven course Prestige Menu selected, next decision was the wines. The charming Sommelier, recommended a half bottle of white and a half bottle of red as we didn't want to drink too much wine. Both wines were very complimentary with the food and we felt, a good selection. The wine pairing menu was tempting but we felt just a little too much wine for us.The menu is spectacular, intricate flavours and inspired presentation. Our favourites were the smoked organic eggs and the hay roasted pigeon. (The best and tenderest pigeon we have ever eaten.) The chocolate dessert was also to die for with delicious details and flavours. Every course was inspired and Chef Julien even presented one course himself, a delight to meet such a talented man. This restaurant is one for a special occasion. it is very expensive, even by world standards but must be heading for Michelin recognition. Congratulations
5
My wife and I went to Jaan for a lunch and were very impressed.The views 70 levels up cannot be beaten, and the restaurant setup is quite small and intimate. A very pleasant place to eat.Service could not be faulted, and the presentation of food was particularly impressive.We had the 3 course lunch and left very content. There was also a good selection of bread (the walnut and raisin bread is recommended) and petit fours.Highlights of our meals were the 55 degree rosemary smoked egg and the pineapple and banana cheesecake.Now that the cheapest wine by the glass is around $25 for a glass.Would definitely recommend
4
despite that the restaurant is atop a not so impressive hotel, once you reach the 70th floor, you understand that it is worth it. Look upon the wondrous city from this height while enjoying a fine dining experience with service to go with it. Food was delicious and if you're there order as many courses as you are able to - it was so much fun each time a new dish came to the table
4
This is our second visit to Jaan. The set lunch has disappeared from the menu but this did not stop us from enjoying our meal. Very chirpy and pleasant waiting staff which stole the day. Will be back for the food and the great view.
5
It's a while since I've been to Jaan, but I felt compelled to write this review after recommending it to a friend for an anniversary dinner. No doubt about it, this is the best restaurant I've been to in Singapore. The views are unbeatable, with the only other places that come close being Equinox next door and Salt Grill & Skybar at Ion (neither of which offer food like this). The service is absolutely fantastic, and Julien Royer's food has to be tasted to believed. Certainly not cheap, but to be honest the price is right for an experience of this calibre. Always looking for an excuse to go back, and I might have to find one soon
5
Look, 10 out of ten is reserved for Guy Lassausaie of Lyon. Chef Julien is a wizard, and his creations are superb, matched only by the wine pairings. Isabel, our French-Canadian sommelier, was as gifted as she is gorgeous. The pairings were inspired, including a white Chateau Neuf du Pape, and an excellent Californian Chardonnay. The view is exceptional, and the dining experience will not disappoint
3
Well, it's exactly like what I have said. The view is great. You see the Marina area all the way to the airport. It's really quite nice. Lunch time probably not as good as night time for the view.The food is very well presented with mist and all the works. Quantity is degustation amount. The pre-dessert and the beetroot sorbet were really good. The pork was tough and the scallop not so fresh. At more than 100 dollars for 5 course lunch, I'll probably just have a nice cocktail at dinner for the view and eat elsewhere
5
it was the second time that i went to Jaan. First time was with a friend for a lunch and was already a very interesting experience so i wanted to go there with my wife to try the dinner. So to share a bit more about it - let's split it by few main categories : - The place/view : it is the first thing that you see or feel when you come-in and frankly the place is really impressive, on top of the swiss hotel with a beautiful view on the marina, a limited number of tables, no "bling bling" decoration, a minimalism approach but very appreciate to be focus on the view and/or the food. - The food : As i said this time i came for the diner and frankly it is two steps above my first experience. There is a real continuity between the different dishes. Surprisingly the two "starters" turning around the ocean with with sea urchin and wild scallops fished manually are very impressive enhancing the product and not hidding it. I also appreciate the fact that some french "classics" were originally revisited bringing something new and very modern crossing tastes to tactefully surprise you.  - The service : It is exactly as how you expect it : very discret - "Very flowing" - not visible except when you need them for anything. Moreover it can be a game to challenge them about wine, food, product origin or the way it is prepared since they are very knowleadgable (not the type of waiter who take the question and run directly to the kitchen to look for the answer to the question). - The wine : We tried the wine pairing mostly for two reasons, we wanted to be surprised by the wine and we didn't see how one bottle can follow such a diversity of food and tastes. We were not disappointed with different cepages - different countries and some regions misknown like spain/rioja for white wine. Really recommended fi you are curious or like to be pleasantly surprised. Overall, i am more and more thinking that Jaan is one of the three best tables in Singapore and a good pretender to two or three stars the day Michelin will start to edit a red guide for Singapore
5
Jaan is really a complete package as a restaurant and from our visit it seemed near perfect. The food was beautifully presented and tasted wonderful and the 3 course lunch menu is excellent value for the high quality and service you receive. We were made to feel special and welcome when we arrived, with the waitress immediately mentioning my wife's shellfish allergy and asking if there was anything else we couldn't eat when we sat down. We asked for a table with a view when we booked online and were duly given a table with one of the best views in the restaurant, directly overlooking the bay which we were delighted with. The restaurant also kindly provided a beautiful individual birthday cake (complete with candle!) after our dinner which was a great touch and a lovely surprise. If we return to Singapore this will definitely be the first place we book
5
JAAN is by far one of the best restaurants I've ever visited. The booking process was very straightforward and response was speedy. We had a table with an amazing view of Singapore, and our lunch tasting menu was heavenly. The food presentation was very creative and colorful, and each dish taste splendid as well. Our waiter was nice and friendly.Would definitely recommend a visit to this place
5
I disagree with some other reviewers here who said the food was only average. I've had quite a bit of experience with fine dining, having had meals at Michelin starred restaurants in Paris, Tokyo, Hong Kong, London, etc and so I know what makes a good restaurant. Yes it was very romantic with the low lighting and spaced out tables (sufficient privacy), and best of all, the table I snagged by making the reservations months in advance (the best in the house: extreme right by the window). But a view to die for wouldn't cut it for me alone -- I demand a lot in terms of dishes and did it deliver. We had the seven course degustation menu, and one of us had it with wine pairing. That was slightly pricey but it was 7 glasses of very high quality wine. Dishes were very balanced, and show cases good French cooking. The hay roasted pigeon was incredible -- the best I've ever had, and perhaps the best meat dish I've had this year. There were lightness in the dishes without it being overwhelming, there was some innovation without it being too molecular or weird. Service was excellent and warm. Yes it wasn't inexpensive -- which fine dining restaurant in Singapore is? But it was worth the evening; I enjoyed it thoroughly
5
From the moment of booking to the end of the experience everything was absolutely magnificent. The booking process was very straightforward. we booked 3 months in advance and asked for a window view table. Every person we spoke to (via email) was very helpful and friendly. When we arrived at the restaurant we were astonished of how pretty everything was and how amazing the view was. We were told that we had the best table in the house and indeed it was absolutely amazing. We had the 7 course menu with wine pairing and it was delicious. We had a lovely waiter which was very friendly and was happy to explain to us every dish if we had any questions. He also gave us lots of tips about what to visit in Singapore. We also had a lovely sommelier, I think she was Australian and she also was amazing. She was super knowledgeable about the wines and she gave as great wines that went very well with our food.The food was an experience itself. It was all done with such an attention to detail that sometimes I almost felt sorry to take the dish apart and eat it. The dishes were not very big but we got to dish number 5 and we started to struggle. We definitely came out of the restaurant very full, so perhaps I recommend to have a 5 course menu instead, unless you have a very big stomach. The bill was quite big, but this is not an everyday restaurant, this is a special occasion restaurant and although it was a lot, when you choose to go to places like Jaan you know that is not a cheap dining. We were very happy with the service and quality of the food given and we definitely recommend it!
3
Yes, the food was good, very good, but was it extraordinary? no, it was not, but the bill was at SGD 1300 for the four of us with only 2 or three glasses of wine in total.Yes we knew that this is not cheap, so I am not complaining and yes, the views are spectacular (don't go if you can*'t have a window table!). All dishes were well prepared but we have had more special dishes at other top notch restaurants in other parts of the world. Sorry but overall this was just "average".
5
I went to Jaan for a birthday surprise arranged by my hubby. I have always loved fine dining for it is art on a plate and Jaan did not disappoint. The staff carefully explaining every dish when it was served adds to the wonderful culinary journey. I'm going to list a few of my favourite dishes as I just cannot select one.1. Amush Bush - Cep Sabayon with Mushroom Tea. This dish left me wanting for more, I just could not have enough. 2. Japan Uni with prawn jelly and caviar. OMG! A lover of caviar and uni it was one of the freshest and best I have ever tasted. 3. Jaan Smoke Egg with Chorizos - Three senses were aroused - Sight, Smell, Taste! 4. Blue Lobster with Truffle Barley Risotto - You have to taste to believe how great it was. 5. Chocolate Tart (Cannot recall the name) - Been a long time that the dessert tastes as good as the main courses. The different chocolates in the dessert just made the perfect end to a wonderful meal. The food at Jaan is not about a meal that you eat and forget. It is pure culinary journey that is unforgettable. We literally returned every dish fully eaten. We would have licked our plates if it was not rude to do so.Thanks team Jaan for the wonderful service and wonderful food! A place i will never ever forget :
5
What an evening! - Celebrated my wifeÂ´s birthday at this great restaurant on 70th floor (a few floors above our hotel room). Had best view table and one of our best dinners ever. Everything was so delicious, tasty, and was so elegantly presented. Innovative and creative. Service was top professional - and friendly. Will for sure receive 3 Michelin stars when Michelin starts ratings in Singapore.Will definitely come back
5
We were staying at The Fairmont and lunch at Jaan seemed like a logical choice.We were very happy with the service, everything was very pleasant and polite.We were really stunned by the food flavours and presentation.We never expected such an awesome find with what we thought was just a casual lunch.The food tasted really good and presentation was so artisitic.We were very pleased with the extras they threw in with the 3 course lunch like the petite fours that came with a bit of drama with the liquid nitrogen rosemary cup.Overall very good, great views of the marina from this height at 70th floor.Will return for their dinner menu sometime soon
5
Some of the reviews of Jaan on Trip advisor have me scratching my head. This restaurant is of outstanding caliber! It is easily the best meal i had on a recent trip to Singapore. The view is unbeatable, the simplicity of the dinning room makes abundant sense when you receive the first course, the food is as breath taking as the view, ascetically Jaan presents food that can rival any, any where. One of the most refreshing things for me about the food is although it is plated with precision and great care. Its clear the most import thing to the kitchen is the flavor! everything tasted amazing, balanced perfectly, and cooked with an obvious obsession with excellence. i could go on all day about how perfect this meal was from start to finish, But you are best to just make a reservation and see for yourself. On a side note, i should mention the chef was away. Chef Kirk controlled the kitchen in a manor where even a season dinner could tell the kitchen hadn't missed a beat. I was particularly impressed when he presented a few dishes table side and explained a few things in regards to techniques! Also the sommilier Chris left a very lasting impression his wine knowledge and pairings were fantastic! i usually don't enjoy Conac, but Chris presented my wife and i with an outstanding one at the meals end which we savored! Its obvious to see this restaurant has amazing staff that share the visions of its owners and are preforming at an absolutely world class standard. will it become the best restaurant in Singapore? i hope so! go now
2
My husband and I always go out for a nice dinner meal at least twice a month and we went to this place days ago because of the good reviews. However it was the other way around.  I've been to other fine dinning places and I can say that they were a lot more better. To be fair though, presentation was really nice but that's all.
5
Every month I get together once with my girlfriends for lunch. Due to the school holidays we missed several months of catch-up, so decided to make up for it by going to on of the best places to dine - Jaan. We've only been there once before, but the experience was so incredible we had to go again.Located on the 70th Floor of the Swissotel, you've got classic panoramic views. Pair this with traditional table-side service and you've hit gold.Be prepared to take your time - the five course set lunch took us nearly three hours. Many of the patrons are business types who come in suits / jackets / long sleeves, so bring a wrap if you've dressed light or you feel the cold!The service was fantastic, and the food? Brilliant. The presentation was stunning with careful thought going into the choice of colours, textures, and flavours. Every course will give you a reason to say "wow.
2
This place was really disappointing. The ambience is poor. It's more like a function room. Quite open and not warm or much atmosphere. The kitchen is elsewhere. The views of course are very good if you get a table by the glass. The service is very hit and miss and you are quickly dismissed if you don't order additional expensive wine. Our set meal included wine already. The appetiser dishes we had were very good and were the highlight of the night. Things were pretty average from there and in one case, disastrous. The highlight of the night was supposed to be quail. Done a different way. We took their recommendation but what we got was a hunk of quail meat that was very, very rare and very gamey. No bones or crispy skin. Just a very bloody gamey hunk of meat that was a struggle to get through. Aside from that dish, nothing was awful or bad, but for over SGD$1000 for two people I expect a lot and I sorely disappointed. I will never be back. Snooty service, poor ambience, and food that can be bettered elsewhere.
5
I lived in Singapore for 18 years and this is the best restaurant in my view for a special occasion. I took my Mother here for her 60th birthday. They reserved a special table for us with a view over marina bay sands where we sat and watched the sun set as we had a glass of champagne and amuse buche. The food was excellent and the service also lovely. They even prepared a cake for my mother (although we were so full we couldn't eat it!). It may have because we went on a Monday but the staff made us feel so special with the best view in the house
5
Definitely should come and try it. It is on the 70th floor of the Swissotel in with a gorgeous and view. We tried the 7 course menu. They modified the menu for one of us who cannot eat seafood. So if you do not like special types of food, you should mention it to the server first.Every course is great. You can refer to the photos.
4
We have a wonderful Dom Perignon (DP) pairing dinner at Jaan's private room and enjoyed another memorable experience here. The menu is carefully planned to pair with our favourite champion: Seabass Carpaccio/DP vintage 2003, Zucchini Trumbetta/DP vintage 2000, Brittany Lobster/DP Rose vintage 2000 (my favourite!) , Landes Yellow Chicken/DP P2 Vintage 1998 and a sweet ending of strawberry 'Feuilles A Feuilles'. Service is dependable, food is carefully prepared and table setting is impeccable. A consistently great place that you could depend upon. This is definitely a place if you have something special to celebrate, or just want to have a great time, great view. Oh, and the Rose vintage 2000 is surprisingly brilliant and fleshy fruitiness with a subtly bittersweet note, love it
5
Deserving restaurant to be one of the best in Asia. The food served was superb. Went for the surprise 10 course menu which included the classics of Jaan which were well executed.
Be sure to request for the window view when you're there to impress.
5
A very enjoyable experience from start to end! We went with the 5-course menus, but the meal was really a 8- or 9-course with all the amuse bouches, soup, bread, palate-cleanser-before-desserts and mignardises generously thrown in. My boyfriend went for the degustation menu while I chose the 'Jardin Gourmand' vegan menu (how could anyone make a whole course without meat taste so good!), and everything tasted superb. We were captivated by the presentation of every dish placed before us. Service was impeccable and thoughtful
1
It is not a big place with about a dozen tables, but the deco is poor comparing to the buffet area outside. Set lunch menu was offered from SGD 68 for 3 course to 118 for 7 course. First of all, it was a business lunch for 3 persons. Two of us wanted to order 3 courses and the third guest ordered 7. After the waitress took our order and came back saying that the chef couldn't serves both 3 and 7 courses, they needed to 'match our courses' together. Although two of us with 3 courses explained that we didn't mind to wait for the 3rd guess to eat, but the manager insisted that it couldn't be accommodated. This left us no choice but we changed to 5 courses to "narrow" the gap with the 7 course. Service is poor. They liked to interrupt our business conversation and insisted to introduce as scripted about the name and ingredients of each of the course. Therefore, 7 courses interrupted 7 times. Speaking of the food, I've been to more fine dinning places. Other than presentation and lots of dry ice, the food is mediocre. The bill for SGD500 for 3 persons. Given the same budget, I would rather go somewhere else
4
They have a 3 course set lunch with a special price, making it affordable for everyone. The service staff was friendly and knew perfectly all dishes. The set lunch included as well an appetizer and a dessert. Food quality was excellent, as expected and the views from our table breathtaking
5
Had a wonderful meal at Jaan the views are exceptional over the harbour (book a window table) and the food was exquisite. Enhanced by the friendly staff and the sommelier gave some great recommendations, she is more than willing to adjust the wines to your tastes. We booked this for a special occasion and this really is a special restaurant
5
We had lunch at Jaan restaurant ! Luckly we got the change to had try this Asia Best 50 rest ! The food presentation was outstanding ! Fabulous ! The service was one of the best expierence ! Thnks to Jaan team to take care us
5
Normally a spectacular view like the one on offer at Jaan comes with average food - however in this case the food more than matched the setting. Every course of our degustation meal was a delight. The meal as a whole was well judged and delicious. The service was impeccable and a special mention must go to the sommelier who assisted us with wine matches to enhance our meal. She was excellent!
5
Jaw-dropping views and eye opening creativity. It was a special occasion so a special location was called for. Boys, if you want to impress, this will do it! 180 degree views of this amazing city sets the scene. But the best was yet to come.....We opted for the nine course degustation menu, from memory, there's one that's a little less and one that's a little more. One at a time, each plated creation was brought out with just enough ceremony. An announcement of what it was and, if required, some pointers on how to tackle the dish.The highlight for me was the 55 minute rosemary smoked egg. Yes, that's what I said. I won't spoil it for you, except to say it was an experience for all the senses.If you want to spoil yourself, this has to be one of the best ways to do it in Singapore.Enjoy

had another wonderful degustation par excellence at jaan on 16.6.2014. regretfully jaan is fully booked for the rest of the year for feed-at-raffles (FAR) discounts. looks like only mikuni & occasionally equinox & prego to go to.the new amuse bouche of beetroot macaron, an eel mousse, (can’t remember the last) plus the rye cracker with very good hummus was good, pleasant & quite fine, though no better than previous.the second amuse bouche, a cepe mushroom tea, was the best soup ever, so intense & flavourful & lingering.#1 the ocean seafood composition was simply delicious! every item was excellent & there were so many – langoustine, oyster (yummy!), scallop, ikura (salmon roe), eel, caviar, another prawn. i could have this again! not quite sure what the toast do? anyway a good toast.#2 the zucchini trumbetta was nice, pleasant, refreshing, not quite a standout among so many excellent dishes.#3 the 64degC 55mins sous vide egg with iberico chorizo was quite a complete dining experience with the dry ice foam flowing down. the silky egg yolk added texture combination to the crispy iberico chorizo.#4 the foie gras preparation/presentation had changed several times but texture wise quite the same. the inside was soft tender tasty. the outside though was different from the more caramelised preparation which we preferred.#5 monk fish was pretty good – firm, bouncy. meat was slightly sweet. somehow all the monkfish i tried in singapore (& this was a better one) could not match the excellent sweet tasting monkfish ala plancha i had in barcelona’s bouqueria market & tapas restaurants. white asparagus was very good, very tasty & tender. #6 the hay roasted pigeon was as usual, nothing less than superb. the medium rare sous vide breast was the best. i couldn’t quite decide if amsterdam beulings’ quail was better or this. :-)the best dinner we had at jaan though was on 20.1.2014 where we had miyazaki beef in place of pigeon. the grape granite palate cleanser was refreshingly good. #7 choconuts was supposed to offer different temperature, texture & taste. i supposed it did & its a good dessert, but i thought some of the previous choconuts editions were distinctly better.the petit four were good or competent for this level of restaurant, not a standout.well, looks like i have to try the waiting list & see my luck play out. see my full reviews & photos at http://chefquak.com/2014/06/18/another-fabulous-degustation-dinner-jaan-on-16jun2014

Jaan is so much better than it's near neighbour Equinox. It still has the fabulous views, but with it is fantastic food served by knowledgeable and helpful staff.We had the 7 course tasting menu, all of which was delicious with little touches of stage management along the way (such as dry ice). I'm not generally a huge fan of this artistry believing it actually detracts from the food but in this instance it was a light touch and added to the mastery of the chef.Many previous reviews have talked about not getting a table by the window. To be honest all the tables have a good view so don't be out off if you are seated back a little. The restaurant is much smaller than Equinox - only 40 covers so everyone is treated to a very personalised service.For me this is one of the best meals I have ever eaten, and yes it has a price tag to match but for that special occasion, definitely worth it
5
Excellent food by a talented chef. Beautifully presented. Seasonal menu and nice view. Intimate and great service!
5
We went for lunch and got the 5-course option - highly recommended! Every taste combination, smell, and look of each dish was phenomenal. It was great being right by the window overlooking Singapore from the 70th floor as well, I'd recommend this to anyone.
5
Nice n lovely ambience with great dishes served with fascinating view of Singapore at night. Try to get window seat if you're there to celebrate special occasion with your loved ones.

I am a fan! I came here for the first time for the degustation lunch menu ( 5 courses) for my mums birthday. We experienced exceptional service from the moment we made the reservation to being the last guests to leave in the afternoon. The food, each dish a wonder to flavours, small explosions of heat, cool, sweat, salty, sour. The quality of the produce and passion of the chef was seen throughout our lunch, with each dish and each mouthful. I can highly recommend it for a wonderful food and restaurant experience, along with amazing Singapore views. Loved it so much we rebooked on the day
5
Set on the 70th floor of the Swissotel, Jaan is a fairly intimate space with great views over Marina Bay. We didn't book in time to get a table by the window, but even the non-window tables have a fairly good view. In fact, the view doesn't really matter because there are far better things to grab your attention on the table...We chose the seven course Prestige tasting menu and it was fabulous. From the little savouries and the amuse bouche right through to the cheese and the puddings, every course was an absolute delight. Each dish was beautifully presented and showed some lovely inventive touches, but at no time did I feel that presentation had taken precedence over taste. All the ingredients were very fresh and perfectly cooked, and the balance of flavours was a delight. I would also recommend the wine paring, provided that you have a wide ranging palate. They had chosen some very interesting wines, some of which were unexpected, but I felt each one complemented the food very well.The service was also first rate. Not only was it efficient, the waiting staff were also very engaged and really seemed to care that we should enjoy the meal.It is undoubtedly expensive, but I thought it was well worth it for the quality of the meal we had. Overall I thought it was an excellent meal and a highly enjoyable evening. We shall undoubtedly return

Visited this restaurant whilst on our honeymoon having read about it as one of the top restaurants in South-East Asia. As such it was expensive (£350 - 2xTasting menu) but included the food, cocktails, cheese course, wine and coffee. It was worth every penny. Our evening began taking cocktails in the bar overlooking the city (70th floor) with an amazing sunset and very tasty drinks and nibbles. A short wander through the 70th floor took us up into the very private and beautiful dining room. There was about 14 tables all facing the great views across the city and out over the water. The service was personal and appropriate for a venue such as this and the team were happy to accommodate my 'no fish' diet substituting the fish items of other tasty options. The food was exquisite and presentation was original and fun. We were so glad we chose JAAN as our special meal in Singapore and if we are back in town we would book again without a second thought. Tip - book well in advance and ask for one of the four window tables. Also make sure you contact them to reconfirm your booking on the day.Thanks to the team at JAAN

Based on the first visit, it is hard to know why this restaurant gets such rave reviews, so perhaps a second visit is justified. On a recent weekday, the set lunch menu was just so-so. Perhaps Jaan fares better on its a la carte menu. The lunch sets are sure to be avoided
5
On recent visits to Singapore we also reserve one night for Jaan. If you want to have a special dinner with friends or loved ones, I would recommend Jaan in Singapore. Where else can you dine and have spectacular views of Singapore. The last time we dinner, we had a fireworks display and the great thing was the restaurant was actually above the fireworks, we were actually looking down on them. I recommend on the food front the degustation and matching wine, you will not regret it
4
I was at Jaan for dinner and really enjoyed the food. Especially impressed by the presentation and also the service standard. Staff were generally friendly and we also caught a glimpse of Chef Julien when we went to speak with obe table of diners. Textures and flavours of the dishes is comparable with other French fine dining restaurants. However with the steep prices I probably wont be back there any time soon. Probably a special occasion only dining destination

This is my 3rd or 4th time here after an absence of 1+ years. During the reservation , i mentioned i was celebrating my birthday and requested for a window seat. They replied to say all the window seats were taken, fair enoughWhen we arrived, i can see that there are 6 tables by the window, and 6 tables away from the window. i was given a table right by the middle entrance, where everyone passing by the corridor can see us. I then assumed the restaurant would be fullWe opted for the 5 course lunch and it started off well - 2 amuse bouche that were tasty and creative. Starter of 63 degree egg was excellent and came with dry ice dramatic flair. The other vegetarian starter was colourful but apart from that, forgettable. The salmon confit with roast pork was ok. The main of lamb was very good. Dessert was a chocolate tart, and very good also. Ended with petit fours, which the dry ice performance was repeatedJust before dessert, they offered the truffled brie as an extra at a cost, which we declined. If we ordered the 3 course set, we would probably have tried itHalfway through the meal, only 5 of the window tables and 2 of the other tables (including me) were taken. And the couple with the other non-window table was given the window table. why not me? Who knows. And i was getting a little upset as obviously there was no one else in the other non-window tables, and they were much better positioned in the quiet corners, compared to my "middle of the restaurant and next to the entrance table"And of course, the fact that i was celebrating my birthday there and mentioned it during my reservation didn't matter to them. There was no effort on their part to make you feel specialOn the above 2 points, there is no way i can give them 5 stars although i very much liked to in the beginning. May not retur

Very impressed over the quality of food and service. Love the ambience. It is definitely a restaurant you must try! Well done guys.

My friend and I had dinner there recently and had the menu prestige at S$238 each before service charge 10% and goods and services tax 7%and a bottle of white wine . When I asked for water , the Caucasian who was taking the order asked me if it was normal or sparkling , I said again normal water, he again asked if I wanted still or sparkling water. Thinking that the restaurant wasn't going to offer one normal water , I asked for still. Dinner was wonderful , each course amazing with complexity of tastes and textures .When the bill came , I found out that the still water offered was "Omuse" still water and was a stiff S$18 a bottle before taxes!I am willing to pay for wine and even Acqua Panna but it is ridiculous to pay this for water to drink at dinner !The very least the person taking the order could do is to inform the guest of the cost or provide a water menu for him to choose from. It left a very unpleasant aftertaste to a otherwise wonderful evening .This kind of experience makes the customer feel as he was being taken for a fool. Management should look into this issue of clearly stating the options for drinking water for guests seriously if they are truly concerned about the guest's dining experience .My bill for dinner was S$680 for 2 persons
4
I had lunch there last week and the whole experience from start to finish was spot on.From the minute we got to the top floor and met the lady at reception right through the culinary experince, it was top notch. Lunch is great value for money and its a busy little place with roughly 30-35 seats. All of the courses were very well excuted from the canapes through the the amuse bouche and right through the starters, cleancer, mains, pre dessert, desssert and petit fours. Very enjoyable and very well balanced from textures and flavors
4
It's probably the best restaurant in town!The food is just AMAZING!! I'm going there often to bring my clients or friends.The chef could deserve easily a 2 Michelin stars except for..... the service...I know that in Singapore it's complicated to get a good service but for a restaurant like Jaan it's a shame that the waiters or managers are not up to the standards of the food.Staff doesn't speak English properly, all have different uniform so you don't know who is the sommelier/manager or waiter. Water is forgotten, bread not replenish (even if you asked twice)I honestly love this restaurant so I keep coming back but they should hire staffs with experience of gastronomic restaurants
5
Another dinner last night reconfirmed: What the chef Julian, and the service team, Catherine, Frank and others, achieve continues to be unmatched in Singapore. Also, Jaan is a place where you can go every couple of months and the menu changes, with season and availability of ingredients. Don't miss Jaan on your travels to Singapore

A restaurant for those who wish only the newest and most imaginative of eating experiences. You will be offered one of three fixed price meals: 5 courses, 7 courses, or 10 courses. Everyone at the table must order the same meal. Prices range from $200 per person and up, not including wine, tax, or tip. Service is superb and the food preparation is extraordinary. But it would be nice to have some choices and at least a few wine choices for less than $100 per bottle (there were about a half dozen out of well over 100 wines). Definitely not for the average person who wants a very nice meal at a reasonable price. An experience not attuned for mere humans
5
What can I say ? It was a terrific French night out !The food is delicious. The presentation is fantastic. The staff is perfect (experienced AND friendly).To give one example: we had a dish called "ocean". It was arranged in form of a wave (consisting of seafood, fish and vegetables in different textures from raw over poached to grilled) - a pleasure to taste.We had the best pigeon ever (cooked in hay).Closing my eyes I would not have been able to differentiate between Jaan and the best restaurants in Paris. Opening them I would, because there is no view like that in Paris.One small negative issue: the wine prices are pure horror for Europeans and mainly focussed on labels..
5
We had lunch at Jaan (this was our second time) and chose a 3 course lunch. The sommelier chose some very good champagne and wine for us.The 3 course lunch consisted of 8 (if we counted correct) different dishes all in all. I have been to a few Michelin-rated restaurants in Europe, but in my opinion the food at Jaan is much better than in any of them.The dishes were symphonies of taste, and artwork to look at. Simply fantastic.And with a 70th floor window table looking out over Marina Bay Sands and the Gardens by the Bay, the settings could hardly be better.Highly recommended
5
Having been in Singapore for a week on business I spent my last day having lunch at Jaan- what a way to end my trip! During my stay I ate at a number of fine dining restaurants and this was the best by far. I have some dietary restrictions (no pork or seafood) and so I opted for the five course vegetarian degustation menu which became 9 courses if you include the amuse bouche, lentil hummus with wafer lavosh, hors d'oeuvres and pre-dessert. My favourite dish was the beetroot and burrata salad containing many different types and consistences of beetroot (jelly, gelato, gel, sliced, wedge, puree) with burrata, raspberries and a honey cheese- this was perfection on a plate. I do not have a negative thing to say about Jaan... Service, food and the views are great. Highly recommended
5
We celebrated New Years Eve 2013 at JAAN, and did not regret it for a second. The restaurant is located on the 70th floot of the Stamford Swissotel in Singapore, with a stunning view of the Marina Bay and Downtown area. A perfect view for the Marina Bay fireworks!The food we got served was a 10 course deustation menu, with additional amouse bouche, sweets and champagne included for 458SGD per person. The quality of the food was outstanding, and as my wife was pregnant, the Chef solved all of her dietary requirements perfectly. There was even a professional photographer present, taking great photos of us during dinner, which we got to take home with a nice frame included, for no additional cost.We had a great evening here, and would recommend this restaurant for anyone interested in fine dining in Singapore

This is a difficult review b/c based on flavour profiles alone, this is one of my top 3 restaurants (so far). We ordered the 10 course degustation after tasting his amuse bouche that was packed full of flavour in a parcel slightly larger than a thumbnail. His food is hard to describe b/c he does not prepare "beetroot salad" instead beetroots appeared in liquid, roasted, meringue and sorbet form - or so it appeared on the plate - but this is not form without function, each bite is slightly different. There are many flavour facets, all of them pleasing. I was hesitant to book this restaurant b/c of poor reviews but the foie gras (my favourite food) was sublime and paired with a Riesling literally brought tears to my eyes. This foie gras is etched into my top 10 food memories. I don't understand the poor reviews with regard to food, although dessert was not as memorable as the savoury, there was nothing to complain about. I cleaned every plate.The 10 course meal was filling and I am a BIG eater. We did not get any "extra" courses and while I was full, I always enjoy a little extra from the chef...to personalize the meal. That's just me. =)Service was excellent as expected. Our waitress while professional was very personable. The pacing of the dishes was appropriate- 10 courses took 4hr. I did have to request extra bread but it was promptly served.Someone commented that they were not given an a la carte option. We weren't either but I do think his food is meant to be an experience (sorry, sounds pretentious) b/c he doesn't make salad/meat/fish dishes so ordering beets, chicken and dessert, one may end up hungry and dissatisfied - like looking at half a painting and wondering what the fuss is about.So why not 5 stars? For food alone, it would be 5 stars easily but restaurants are about more than food. The biggest barrier is price. This was easily the most expensive meal I've had so if money is no object or someone else is paying: GO! As a once in a lifetime experience it was worth every penny but as food is subjective and this place is SO expensive, it's hard to recommend it unreservedly. As well, I'm not sure they have a sommelier. The manager did the wine introductions. Some of the pairings were perfect, and if they had all hit the mark, there would be no contest.Finally, I understand all the food is flown in from France. I understand this is the food the chef understands, but in this locavore age (Vancouver is such a wonderful example of this) it does make me feel guilty. Then again, Singapore is an island so technically most food is brought from elsewhere. Please note that as part of the Stamford hotel, their reservation system appears to be centralized, so confirm that you have reserved at Jaan b/c they may accidentally put you in another restaurant! Would I go back? Like falling in love for the first time, perhaps a return visit may not live up to expectations. But who knows? Maybe like true love, it takes a few tries

It was new year's eve dinner and Chef Julien Royer designed an impeccable dinner menu that impressed any epicureans with the most demanding taste bud. Julien's cuisine evolves around the fundamental of selecting only the best produces sourced from France and around the world and preparing them in the most simplistic and modern way, i.e. bringing out the best of each product in a modern inventive way. I understand that several guests had raised the issue of price when dining at JAAN, but one has to remember that high quality produces import from France into Singapore are expensive. JAAN is situated on the highest floor of Swissotel, a complex owned by CapitaMall REIT that demands the highest rental yield in the market. In the kitchen, we have more than a team of 10 assisting Julien in preparing the food and in the dining hall, Frank Philippe leads a team of dedicated service staff looking after all guests. With regard to the cuisine, my pictures will tell a thousand words. To sum up, I've never experience cuisine of such high level of standards in Singapore, may be at Robuchon fine dining in Sep 2013 when MOF Chef Eric Bouchenoire (right hand man of Robuchon) was cooking and leading inside the kitchen. Lastly, Julien's cuisine easily surpasses the 3 Michelin stars restaurants rated by the absurd Michelin team in Hong Kong

The Jaan restaurant is located in the tower of the Stamford Swissotel on the 70th floor. If you are lucky and it did not rain before (clean windows) then you have a great view over Singapore. Unfortunately, this was not the case for our visit.We have been offered three set menus (a 5 course degustation menu for 198SGD, a 7 course prestige menu for 238SGD and 5 course vegetarian Jardin gourmand menu for 148SGD). Corresponding wine cost around 100SGD per person in addition. Unfortunately, they did not offer an a la carte menu to have a wider choice. I only saw this a la carte menu when I visited their website afterwards. Please be aware that the waiters that are helping you to choose the menu are a bit obtrusive - always trying to sell additions to the courses of the menus they are offering you (e.g. very seldom Italian truffles that of course they have available...). As other reviewers have outlined, the food is really good. However, it is ridiculously overpriced. As they did not even offer the a la carte menu and only tried to sell their expensive menus, we felt a bit deceived afterwards.I guess, it is hard to find a place in Singapore where you pay more for a comparable dinner experience. We had some really good dinners at other nice places in Singapore.I therefore cannot recommend this place

Have been recommended by the concierge of Marriott hotel, we decided to give a try since I'm missing the "real" French food for a long time.Started with superb champagne cocktails and the waiter was very knowledgable who spent quite a few minutes to explain the menu.I love the foie gras and my wife enjoyed her saint Jacques by different ways.Overall the Wine is very expensive here, as we are not able to finish a bootle, the restaurant sommelier recommended good choices of wine by the glass. Perfectly matching with the main course.I've been traveling many years and it's first time that the chef came out and check on the feedbacks. Thank Chef de cuisine Julien and his team made the night enjoyable.It's true dine and drink are very expensive so make sure you spent the money in the right place likes JAA

This was my first experience with fine dining and it was everything I thought it would be. The service was impeccable, the dining room was small and intimate with a great view, and the food was divine. I had the Jardin Gourmand menu, which is completely vegetarian, something I found to be quite lacking in fine dining restaurants in Singapore from a little research online. As a vegetarian, it was easily the best and most impressive meal I've ever had. Every flavour was exquisite, and there was some pretty unexpected and innovative combinations, which worked out really well. I love the chef's hummus, but my favourite had to be the brie and the truffles ice cream. If you're a vegetarian and looking for a one-time splurge on some excellent cuisine, I can't recommend this enough

I embarked on a voyage of culinary pleasures at one of 16 world-class restaurants and bars available at the Swissotel The Stamford, Singapore. JAAN Restaurant soaring high on level 70 – cuisine inspired by Chef de Cuisine Julian Royer.Chef Julien Royer is passionate about the freshest ingredients through simple but carefully thought out dishes that reflect his own creativity and the grace of all things wholesome. Chef Julien was born into a family of famers in Cantal – Auvergne (Central France). “The appreciation of food I learnt from my family, and the importance of organic and seasonal produce is perfection”.Artisanal Cuisine, A Way of Life – an inspired title on my menu. I was intrigued in Chef’s cooking philosophy and devotion to sourcing the best tasting food from all parts of the world, including local suppliers respectively.Take a look at some of the delicious meals I was lucky enough to taste. I can honestly say, it was a food celebration where innovation took new colours to flavours.Guests are offered a refreshing taste in his dishes, bringing to the table flavours and textures which are layered and taste-provoking. One of Chef Julien signature dishes is the anticipated mushroom tea, an intensely aromatic nutty amuse buche.This 4o-seat restaurant offers an immaculate fine dining interior featuring a stunning Murano cystal chandelier and Singapore’s best scenic views facing the Marina Bay area. JAAN’s is not only known for its modern French cuisine in Singapore, but proudly offers a wine list of 500 different labels that compliments the menus on offer
4
For our first time in Singapore we decided to do a gastronomic tour with my wife.The location is great the view wowwww but the service was very slow and rude luckly however the food was very nice but some of the dishes not hot enought and few of them to salty four my test.I recommend this restaurant but not on Saturday night they are to busy to deliver a good service due to the fact that they short of manpower
4
the waiting and the service staff are very friendly and professional. the sommelier explain you well the different wines they suggest. all this is excellent and thats what we can expect from a top class restaurant. but the reason of our visit was to taste the withe truffles. unfortunately the truffles - claimed to come from alba - had really no tast
4
We had the seven course taster menu with wine and they had adapted it for us as we are allergic to dairy and wheat. The fact that the chef had done this in itself was impressive as he had tried to stay true to the concept of each dish despite the amendments.The wine complemented the meal very well and we really enjoyed the food, the service and the amazing view. The only down point was the foie gras which we didn't eat - I think the serving staff were a little put out but this was at the start of the meal and didn't really spoil anything.The chef came over to chat and we were given a signed copy of the menu. Excellent and very memorable
4
Jaan is one of those expensive culinary experiences that is more of a bucket list restaurant must do because of where it is, its exclusivity and prohibitively high pricing....not for the food. We, a party of four, ate there 13th November and chose the seven course taster menu, taster is what you get, never enough and left wanting. what you do get is good, make no mistake and the setting is superb, just superb....thank goodness they had the foresight to build a McDonald's at the bottom of the Stamford....cheeseburger and fries please, go large? you bet
4
that is a unforgettable experience in Singapore. Ant the staff services are quite attractive to me. They are nice and helpful. But it has a little bit expensive compare to same quality of restaurant in Singapore.
5
Honestly, I've done many fine dining restaurants in my life and this one would be ranked as #1 all categories, this is actually not a dinner I had, but an outstanding culinary experience telling a true and powerful story about products and origins, Chef Julien from France is amazingly skilled and know how to convey emotions through ingredients (mostly bought from Europe at 90%, and knowing the law in Singapore that forbids many items for importation, that is really a feat !!!)Every single dish is a piece of art, I would even say a masterpiece so that you longly hesitate to destroy it picking in with you fork, you feel sinful and delighted at the same time (all about emotions). Terrific.In additional to that, the service and the view are fantastic, and at the end, at this level we dont even talk about price but for the skeptical ones : be reassured; it remains ridiculously low if you compare with other restaurants of the same level in Singapore which charge 600SGD/pax excluding wine. our price per pax was divided by almost three including wine (250/pax for a 7 courses+extra courses gift from the chef, extremely worthy), HATS OFF Jaan Team 
2
The location of the restaurant is amazing, on top of the swissotel, although the private dining room one level lower has even better views. Unfortunately the way the airco was installed, the windows were completely fogged, ruining the view. The service was very friendly and courteous, as expected. The presentation and taste of the food was very good, as well as the wines that were selected to pair with the courses. Unfortunately our evening was ruined when we received the check. We know Singapore is an expensive city and we were in one of the more exclusive restaurant but we paid over 650$ for two people for a five course meal, even with only one of us taking the pairing wines. This is the most expensive restaurant visit I ever made but sadly the not one of the best. The food was good but not unforgettable. The check however was.
5
A most amazing luncheon waylaid us this week. It was supposed to have been a 3 course lunch but an additional 4 palate teasers effectively made it 7 courses, and what an experience it was. Soup of trumpet mushrooms, the most sublime poached egg ( 55' @ 62C) welsh lamb cooked to perfection...a veritable culinary extravaganza in the making. Absolutely fantastic
5
A delight for all the senses! This evening at Jaan was a gift from my husband, and it was fantastic. Attentive service, refined and inventive cuisine, superb wine. We spent a wonderful evening in this restaurant with a great view of the city. A special mention for the lobster ravioli a feast! We will certainly return when we will come back in Singapore, and I recommend it for any husband that needs to make a surprise
5
My wife and I dined at Jaan on the first night of our honeymoon and opted for the 7 course “Menu Prestige”. The experience was exceptional from start to finish. We had booked in advance so had a well located table positioned next to the window with fantastic views of the Singapore night skyline. Upon arrival we were shown to our seats and recommended a Kia Royale to begin the evening with. Not long after we had confirmed our menu of choice (there were two 5 course menus, a 7 course option and a 10 course surprise menu available) we were served the first amuse bouche which was a selection of canapés including smoked eel, chicken pastilla and rye crackers with home-made hummus. Each of these was fantastic – small but packed with flavour and extremely well presented. Not long after finishing these we were served the second amuse bouche which was a wild mushroom tea – again packed with flavour and elegantly presented.We then moved onto the 7 course menu that we had ordered. Each course was brought out in a timely manner and the waiter took the time to provide an in-depth and accurate description each time. The highlights to me were the signature 55 minute rosemary smoked organic egg with which liquid nitrogen was used to enhance the presentation and the main course which was hay roasted bresse pigeon. The roasted pigeon was brought out to us prior to being prepared in case we wanted to take a photograph. My wife’s favourite course was the grilled foie gras, which came with caramelised figs.All in all the evening was an amazing experience. Yes, it was expensive but we were prepared for this having done our research and being aware that Jaan had been awarded position 22 in Asia’s 50 Best Restaurants which was why we booked it in the first place. We went with high hopes and expectations and left far from disappointed
3
This overhyped restaurant has gone down hill since our last visit 2 years ago. Amazingly, they are still doing the canape with a sardine can, and think it is still cute!The 7 course menu is $296, with some of the courses less than a dessert spoon in size. Lots of liquid nitrogen, which is a bit of a yawn these days. There was a seafood dish with a piece of lobster the size of your thumbnail, cooked till it had not tenderness left.Pigeon was beyond the capacity of the chef and tasted awful, though the cep mushrooms were delicious.The matched wines were an extra $160, and the waiters were so slow they failed to match two of the courses.A very ordinary desert of chocolate lava cake with a tiny splodge of chocolate mousse.All in all, a very unimpressive performance from the kitchen, left feeling hungry and gouged by the prices.The view was remarkable, if you can get a table at the window
5
My hubby surprised me with a lovely dinner to celebrate our 7th wedding anniversary. I am definitely charmed from start to finish while in Jaan. Aside from the excellent 5 course meal, we are very happy to have been served by Jan Jasper Eugenio. His friendly and proactive service made our dining fantastic!
5
This was my second time visited in Jaan.I felt that everything was prepared in a very high standard including their service. The interior design is fantastic - elegant, class and relaxing.Timing of service, from one dish to another, was also very well calculated and so you could enjoy each food in the most desirable condition.The food at Jaan is just amazing, from presentation to eating it, and it's just a wonderful experience I recommend to those of you who enjoy fine dining or would like to dine at a restaurant for a special occasion to go here. The restaurant Manager staff delivered superior service that of a fine dining establishment and were very attentive. We look forward to coming back again!
5
We had the taster menu and it was wonderful. Each course was beautifully presented and tasted divine. Staff were helpful and polite and we didn't have any issues with speed. A wonderful evening with alcohol matched perfectly to each course. The views are very impressive. Highly recommended
5
Absolutely amazing food, the best was surprisingly the zucchini soup, but everything was delicious, drink service a bit slow to start but soon picked up, waiters and waitresses very good, but some other patrons leave a bit to be desired.
1
A bad start to our meals with the service from the door to the table. They could not findout booking and the staf was starting to get impatient with us! When it was finaly sortedout, they just showed us to our table and from then on, everything was slow to come and food took forever to get to us.Cant say i want to go back aain any time soon...

Had the degustation lunch when flying out after the Grand Prix, location, service, foot was excellent . Watch the hidden costs. We were expecting about $190 per head with wine and ended up paying $625 for 2. The cheeses etc are to be paid for and not on the degustation menu. Water was also $20 a bottle for still

My partners and I came here for a long business lunch and I was very impressive by this restaurant! The food is well-served, cooked and balanced with beyond expected presentation. The staff is very attentive, polite and helpful to always give perfect explanations for guests. Moreover, its manager always asks for our satisfaction and shares knowlegde about food. It is very pity if we donâ€™t mention about the fantastic view of Singapore from above

General environment is a simple decorated restaurant at the 70th floor of Swissotel.Yes you have a view - if you are a fan of seeing the electric lights of a city.But you should book a table next to the window if you think it is cool dining in a high rise restaurant.If you are seated at 2nd or 3rd row nothing beautiful or special about that place.Food is - that`s my personal opinion - nothing special. I love indian food but for combining it with "french thoughts" definitely too heavy spiced with indian spices.Really bad was the service of one waiter who was nonstop taking things from our table while we were eating. Asking him to give us time to finish in peace our starters he was offended and kept on behaving not like a professional waiter. Asking him what the cuisine is about he told us - that it is original french - traditional french. Maybe the management has to train their waiters more about what they serve and how they should serve.Paying a total of 600Dollar including an ok tasting bottle of wine..hm...you can have 4 nice dinners at really good restaurants in Singapore

We loved our lunch at Jaan. We had so many courses I lost count. I had a vegetarian / vegan menu whilst the rest of my table had the standard menu and we all came out glowing with happiness and are still talking about it a month later. I did a full review on my blog Living in Sin but here were my personal highlights:- the ratte potato with buckwheat crisps and chanterelle mushrooms- the amazing and constantly surprising Jaan garden- the daterini tomato dishWell, actually, I loved it all so hard to choose

On the 70th floor of the Swissotel the Stamford, the dining room has panoramic views over Marina Bay Sands and is also much in demand during the Singapore GP, overlooking almost the entire race track. Under the guidance of French young gun chef Julien Royer, the view comes in a distant second to the food which is, simply, wonderful. We took the middle ground with the 7-course menu prestige and had a power of food that was tasty, innovative and fun. The 'Choconuts' dessert has to be tasted to be believed. Even the onion brioche from the bread selection is extraordinary. Service is excellent, especially the very bright and bubbly Caty, who knows her stuff. We were lucky to visit during a champagne promotion so that brought the cost per head down but it wasn't over-the-top expensive. A major recommendation
5
a truly wonderful experience for both my partner and myself. having read some reviews, i knew to expect amuse bouche. what i did not expect was that these lovely, thoughtful and extremely tasty treats sprang up a number of times during our meal. truffle ice cream - divine. service was attentive, informative and very helpful too! i have truly fallen in love with Jaan, I will definitely be back, for lunch next time - easier on the pockets.My thanks to Chef Julien, and his AWESOME team

This was highly recommended by the hostel I was stay at and they also helped me make the reservation. This was perfection.Ambience 5/5Food 5/5Service 5/5I love the fact that it was quality over quantity, a small seating capacity means higher attention to detail to each dish and each guest. I would definitely eat this again when I am in Singapore and I would definitely recommend this to friends! :
5
What an experience! oh my. Nothing short of wonderful. The ambiance is great, view spectacular, staff wonderful and the food, like no other experience. The combinations, presentation, the many new platters arriving at the table were each an experience and everything was just so special. Beautifully presented, explained by the waiters and then delicious. One review on this site recommended the hummous - completely agree. was so different and so full of flavour, the Jaan salad should not be missed - so many different tastes on one plate. The atlantic cod was great and then this was topped by the beef with mushroom ketchup. and then there were the desserts... basil sorbet... incroyable. A very special restaurant for a very special occasion
5
Made a reservation for a business dinner party of 8. We had to select a single menu for that size of the party. Reservations was easy and on short notice possible.They kindly waited until everybody showed up and made some suggestions for an aperitif, which turned out to be a nice but pricey Champagne. The courses were all well prepared and served, it started with amuse geule, a marinated langoustine as starter, a salad called Jaan's garden, followed by atlantic cod with smoked eggplant. The main course and attraction was Miyazaki beef striploin, which really turned out a pleasure, with its taste and smell and texture.The party skipped the cheese which was offered for a premium, and we had a strawberry dessert and some coffee. Ahh, as the wine we selected a Pouilly Fume, which is an excellent choice if you do not want to for a wine selected for each course (which was an offer too). For the service, overall it was excellent too, the small downrating comes for 2 reasons.1. there was an accident caused by a waiter which resulted in dropping a pro-camera to the floor, the handling by the staff for this accident was low key.2. maybe because I am German, I do not like pushing for up-selling on this level of luxury - which happened to me quite frequently in Singapore and also at Jaan's. I book it under cultural differences, but maybe they can reconsider it

My wife and I ate at Jaan on Saturday 10 August at lunch time with a couple of friends of ours. The restaurant itself lacks a little character but the staff were friendly and attentive. We were greeting at our table by a number of canapÃ©s which were very nice. We decided to go for the 5 course lunch menu with wine pairing. As the various courses arrived unfortunately only a very small glass of wine arrived and not with each course as we only had 3 wines with 5 courses.We constantly had to keep asking the wine waiter to top our glasses up and when doing so it was with the smallest amount of wine that he could get away with. The portions of the food are incredibly small with and emphasis on quality as opposed to quantity. I have eaten at many Michelin starred restaurants in my life but the portion sizes at Jaan where by far the smallest I have encountered. Thank goodness for the bread. When the bill arrived at just under s$1400 for the 4 of us I was gobsmacked. $50 each for a glass of champagne and $20 each for a bottle of still water how can they justify these prices????? It seems such a shame that restaurants go all to maximise the profit without taking the customer into consideration. Had the bill been more reasonable we may have possibly gone again the Tippling club was half the price for better food, if only Jaan would think about this and perhaps they may have more repeat customers. We will not go back again. My only recommendation about Jaan is eat before you go, there are plenty other places in Singapore where I believe the emphasis will be only quality food and wine and value for money. I'm so disappointed

A very enjoyable dinner. Very high standard of innovative gastronomy with great plating. The view at night was quite interesting. At lunch, it can be rather glaring. Service was great, especially the manager. It was a pity that they had a Korean waitress to explain what was being served. We didn't understand 80% of what she said
5
I was here for lunch today and was pleasantly surprised by the standard of food and the dramatic presentation of food.For example , one of their appetizers called the 'egg' for short was presented in a bed of dry ice and it was a joy to behold. On top of that it actually tasted good !sometimes food presentation may look good but doesn't taste good . I have dined at Andre's before and the concepts are somewhat similar but prices at Jaan are much more affordable. It's not surprising considering that Andre Chiang used to helm Jaan before he started Andre's.It was a great experience considering that my table had a full view of the Flyer , Marina bay sands and ships out at sea. My main course was the ravioli which was exquisitely presented .Dessert which was the Choconuts was a little ordinary I thought.Nonetheless , I had a great dining experience here and look forward to my next meal here

Was invited by our wine supplier. A very pleasant surprise to see a lot of innovation. It was already a while ago but forgot to post. Smoked egg superb and the soup attractively served .All dishes greatly presented. Fish was a bit dissapointing but all other dishes lovely presented well cooked and well balanced for a 5 course lunchgood for a long business or social lunc
5
We went with our young family (9 and 11) and had an outstanding meal.Particular standouts were the 55' rosemary smoked organic egg, the rice marinated langostine and the welsh la,b 'saveur d'orient'. The truffled bread rolls and the hoemade hummus (of chestnuts and lentils rather than chickpeas and tahini) were also memorably delicious.This is not a cheap place, but we don't have the opportunity to fine dine often, so we were prepared to lash out. The package of the meal. The view and the service made it value for money. At 70 floors up, ypu can save your singapore flyer ticket price and put it towards the meal.When I go to this type of restaurant, I expect to get food that I could not reproduce at home, and this certainly fits the bill.A great experience
5
This was a truly memorable dinner for me and my wife. It was our first time - but many more are to come!Every dish was a surprise in itself and an enjoyment for the sins. Every food dish was well presented with a perfect explanation by the staff. The manager Max came by several times to not only ask for our satisfaction but to share his knowledge for food with us - truly passionate!And then of course - there is this fantastic view.We will be back for sure
5
A really super dining experience in Singapore, we had a stunning view and the 5 course set lunch with creative tasty amuse bouche and the rosemary smoked egg slow cooked for 54 minutes i think was stunning in terms of presentation and taste, the other courses were also good, but the egg was the WOW, in general good service and finished with a nice selection of petits fours, I will recommend and I will be back
5
I recently went back to Jaan to treat my friend out for lunch. Chef Royer and the whole staff of Jaan again didn't disappoint! The food was beyond excellent and the service exceptional. Jaan is definitely a place where your money pays for a gastronomic dining experience.
5
My favorite restaurant worldwide. Food, service, deisgn of the plates and cutlery, everything is made to have the most amazing dining experience. You have an amazing view of singapore (if there is no haze of course). The chef Royer is a 30+ years maestro. What ia really like at Jaan is the quantity of food you get, its not like in other fine dining restaurant where you have something pretty but small, at jaan you have perfect quantity for an amazing quality 
5
Jaan is definitely the best culinary experience of my life. The food is amazing (I could say orgasmic) and the service is excellent. The view is also very impressive. It's perfect for a romantic dinner. Bravo to Chef Julien Royer!
2
Average for the price paid. Nothing special about the food. I expected more for that price tag. Go once is enough, just for the experience...
4
Very nice of foods and place surely I love it so much.But its all torn apart by some mistake that is hair on my plate.Could you imagine steak with hair?
5
We had set lunch at Jaan. Food and service is excellent. This is our third visit to this resturant. We enjoy our lunch at each and every visit.
It is value for money. But you must call to reserve to avoid disappointment.
5
I went for lunch with my husband and 2 teenager daughters on 24 June. Happily the haze had lifted so we could see fairly well all over Singapore. Prior to arriving my daughters were concerned about having a window table so high up but this fear vanished when we entered the restaurant as the view is breath taking and there is a steel railing separating the table from the window so you were a little back from the window. Smart idea! The food was presented wonderfully and each course was an occasion. The extra dishes, compliments of the chef were a treat and delicious. We had the 3 course buffet but with the chef's treats were actually served 7 plates. we all thoroughly loved our meals. The girl hostesses were knowledge and unobtrusive. The males a bit much in your face but apart from that certainly a special meal and quite a holiday experience
4
One of the best culinary experiences for me. The location is wonderful. The service is excellent. The food is also excellent, even the plating was quite good.It will be very good for a romantic dinner.The only down side is the meal size and the price. If you have a big appetite, then this place will not fill you up. But fine dining restaurants really do serve relatively small-sized meal, more for degustation
5
This is one of the best culinary experiences I have had. Lets start with the obvious, the view - amazing. The staff were very attentive and knowledgable. The quality of the produce is clear in the taste. I have read previous comments about the meal size, needless to say, this isn't a big slab of poor quality on a plate, this is carefully prepared, fine ingredients in a quantity that allow you to enjoy the meal. We made comment to the waiter on how much we enjoyed part of the dessert, shortly after the chef came to our table with another serving. Well worth the experience
4
The restaurant stands out is the view for me , eating is not only the taste but also the atmosphere and the energy that you get from the staff , about the food was alright nothing really impressed me but tasty though , the wine is good and after all i would recommend it to any type of customers , business ,dating and family

i like the setting of Jaan. it's sort of like a restaurant within the restaurant concept. the decor is extremely minimal, to the point that i thought may be they ran out of money. nice view being so high up, even though i didn't see much because of the haze. service is very professional yet managed to be very intrusive. i didn't like that at all. they are always everywhere and i felt there was little grace. i tried the 7 courses menu and what i liked most about Jaan was the table wears. they were the highlight of my meals. very innovative and pretty. classy too. the presentation was also super super cool. with tricks and all. sadly the waiters rushed everything. i gathered they didn't think it was special cos they do this everyday. but for me, it was very unique. so i felt a bit rushed by them. the food was rather bland for my liking. i give it 7/10 for food. they do have nice breads though. so, i guess just go and enjoy the experience. then go somewhere else for food. i went there by myself, alone, because i really wanted to try it. i am glad i did, but probably won't go back again soon. quite pricey but not as bad as the other places. water, sparkling or still, is expensive. lol. and that's the first question they asked u. i thought that was a cheap ploy. but i had sparkling water anyway
5
I went there on Saturday for lunchtime. The restaurant is located at the 80th floor and the view over Singapore is really impressive.But even much more impressive was the food on the table. all dishes were really excellent and the service very professional.the lunch formulae has a very decent price. You should go..
3
As one of the most reputed French restaurants in the country, Jaan serves a rightly impressive lunch degustation menu, and, much to their credit, at a fairly reasonable price. Each dish in my five-course meal was exquisitely crafted and displayed, sustaining a consistent quality throughout (which, I must say, is no mean feat, even for the very top restaurants). The setting was rather exclusive, serving about 11-12 tables altogether. But that is also where the restaurant could be faulted. With such a privileged pool of customers, one would justifiably expect the service to be personalised. Quite the reverse indeed. Personal attention there surely was, but unfortunately it was executed robotically with a lack of human touch. In an almost mechanical fashion, the question "How is everything?" was put forth after every dish, which could be irritating to the customer, who invariably has to each time produce an equally formulaic answer along the line "Yes, it's great" etc. Frequency of attention does not always translate into sincerity in service. The staff have evidently been trained to introduce each dish properly (with well-memorized ingredient lists), but I suspect they have not been taught to do so with more humility and, most importantly, a smile. Emanating from most of the staff was a do-my-job-and-get-done-with-it attitude -- quite deplorable for a restaurant of this status. Even more deplorable is this: exempted from such impersonal treatment were Caucasian customers, with whom the restaurant manager was conspicuously more concerned. All customers pay about the same bill, and so deserve (and will expect) the same degree of congeniality. Where service quality does not match food quality, the restaurant must be destined for failure in the long term
5
My first time to Jaan and they took really good care of us. The service staff was attentive and catered to our every request.Food portions were small, but was just enough to fill the stomach by the end of the 7-course meal that we had. Presentation was great and sometimes dramatic, but it served to "wow" the senses with the creative design and presentation.The excellent food and service was matched with stunning views of the Singapore urbanscape, with unobstructed views of the Marina Bay Sands IR and promontory, as well as the Singapore Flyer.Price was high, but that's to be expected of a fine-dining restaurant. Highly recommended as a great place to celebrate a birthday or other special occasions
5
THis was by far one of the best meals my wife and I have eaten. We came here on the recommendation from our fellow Trip Advisors. The Restaurant is on the 70th floor of the Swisshotel. Views are some of the best in Singapore. The decor and layout of the restaurant is great. Large round tables with fantastic comfort. The service was fantastic. I had the 5 course degustation menu which when you've added all the complimentary courses totalled 8 or 9 all together. Lost count. Each course was a taste sensation. All your senses were summoned to create an overall sublime dining experience. That coupled with the view ......Best way to describe the Chef Julien Royer was a fusion of Tetsuya and Heston Blumenthal. Big call but worth the accolade.We went for lunch which is unbelievable value for the dining experience. It is way cheaper than the dinner.I highly recommend this restaurant to anyone who wants to experience incredible novelle cuisine at is best. Great place for a celebration
5
We choose this restaurant to celebrate my 50th birthday and we were not disappointed. Being on the 70th floor of the Swissotel it offers a fantastic view of Singapore and so before we went to the restaurant we enjoyed a drink in the bar and were able to watch the sun go down over the places we had visited during our stay. Unfortunately, we couldn't get a table next to the window but you still get a fantastic view as the restaurant is small. As for the food it was fantastic, we opted for the five course with wine choice but by the end of the evening we had had ten courses as in between courses the chef sends out other dishes for you to try. Whilst, the portions are not huge the quality and flavours are superb. As this is fine dining the food not only tastes good but looks fantastic. In fact we ended up taking pictures of each course. The waiters explain what each course is and tells you a bit about the wine that accompanies it and then check to make sure if everything is fine. This is definitely a restaurant for special occasions
5
This is my first time back at Jaan after the excellent Andre Chiang left as chef and opened up his own place. Decided to return , and for lunch. They have a 3 course "business lunch", 5 course more expanded menu, 5 course vegetarian and 7 course for those not needing to go back to work after lunchThey are some small nibbles to start , which were all good. The amuse bouche of mushroom tea soup was innovative and excellent. The breads were made fresh and warm. My starter was 1 of their signature dishes, a poached egg dish and it was excellent. The presentation of dry ice, and pouring the poached egg from its shell onto our bowls were inspired. My main of ravioli with iberico ham was a small portion of 3 pieces of ravioli, but i am a small eater. Big eaters may not be pleased. My friend's lamb main was also 3 tiny slivers of lamb cooked 3 ways. My dessert was another signature , choconuts #4, apparently the 4th itieration of the dish. It was quite ordinary, and would have preferred the brie cheese and truffle ice cream dish that my friend had. Petit fours was another exercise of artistry with rosemary ice cream lollipops etc.Overall, an excellent place for imaginative cuisine and fantastic views of the city. If i have to be picky, i would say 1 of the servers was too stiff and the staff on the ground floor who had to direct you was difficult to understand with her foreign accen

Jaan decor seems to be taking a page out of the Per Se (Manhattan) book with its large round tables facing the large windows overlooking the incredible view!Food was quite lovely, and though I have fish and seafood allergies, the kitchen was accommodating for the 7-course menu, of which they had two versions: one with a mix of fish and meats, and one vegetarian. However, this was one of the first times in which the maître d' made a huge deal about how it was such a struggle to switch out the seafood dishes and an immense difficulty of changing the wine pairing, and when I received the dishes, they were in fact simply courses from the vegetarian menu, and ALL the wines served with my dishes were the same as those served with my husband's seafood dishes. I realize this sounds very whiny, and I really have no problem with receiving the vegetarian dishes, but when paying for fine dining, it seems silly to make a huge deal out of something that really has never been a huge issue at other restaurants.One additional tip: if a larger customer enters your restaurant, do not offer them an armless chair "for their comfort" unless that person expressly asks you if there is such an option. Such events can trigger feelings of shame and embarrassment and will utterly ruin the dining experience. All customers are paying customers and deserve the same dining experience. If it is your intent merely to inform customers that such options are available, place this information on your website

The website states that 'Jaan" is derived from the Sanskrit word for "bowl," which makes sense considering that Thai for "plate" is jaan, and Javanese for "wok" is wajaan, but it also means "life" or "darling" in Hindi, and Jaan is the darling of those who love beautiful food in beautiful surroundings in Singapore. We had dinner at Jaan while we were staying at Swissotel the Stamford. They asked for our name at three gates: once at the ground floor podium at Equinox Centre, once at the Equinox Bar on the 70th floor, and once at Jaan restaurant. At the third inspection, the waiter had some difficulty finding our name which was amusing considering they found our names at the other two gates so easily. We had reserved a window table, and we were shown to what probably was the best table in the restaurant, all the way on the right, facing the Marina Bay Sands and the estuary of the Singapore River so that we could see the laser light show at 8 pm. The service was polite and omnipresent, at times almost fawning. The manager stopped by our table and chatted briefly. We shared the 48-hour braised ribs with potatoes as a main course. It was delicious, especially with the 2009 Gewürztraminer from Alsace which was even tastier than a moscato that we ordered from the menu of dessert wines. There were at least three amuse bouche. We had three desserts which were unusual but not memorable. There are many restaurants on high floors with views in Singapore, and we think Jaan provides the best view, a fine selection of wines, and an excellent meal. We recommend Jaan for special occasions
5
...I guess that will do for a start.We visited Jaan for lunch while in Singapore and it qualifies as one if the meals of our lives. We chose the 5 course degustation and each course (and the extras) offered food which delighted both eyes and taste buds. I'll save you a mouthful by mouthful account but the highlights included a wonderful mushroom-based amuse bouche and a lamb dish which was out of this world. Singling out individual elements is however a little unfair when everyhing comes together so well. The food, wine, waiting staff, atmosphere and the view all contributed to a meal which eill long in the memory
5
A small restaurant tucked away on the 70th floor. Walk in to be faced by the most amazing view over Singapore. Book early for a window seat and watch the sunset. We decided on the a la carte menu rather than the degustation menu and thoroughly enjoyed the meal. Each dish was explained in detail, wine suggested to compliment the dish. An amazing experience
5
Came here for lunch on a Saturday and was instantly swept away on a magical adventure that thrilled all our senses from beginning to the end.The view kept us sufficiently enthralled until the waiters introduced us to the wonderful offerings on the menu. We were kept constantly enthralled by the array of dishes that certainly tasted as good as they looked ... and it was one of those meals that you didn't want to end.If you want to indulge a little and have an amazing view to go along with heavenly food ... no other place can literally take you that high!Kudos to everyone at Jaan

See full reviews & photos at my blog=http://chefquak.wordpress.com/2013/05/14/degustation-dinner-at-my-favourite-restaurant-jaan-on-8may2013/ dinner at Jaan has always been a most enjoyable experience. we used to go Jaan quite a lot when Andre Chiang first arrived, and while we enjoyed his degustation dinners we liked his ala carte menu even more. when Andre left (predictably) to set up his own restaurant & some swedish chef joined Jaan, we had given it a miss for most part of 1+ years, but somehow managed to rediscover Jaan a year+ ago when it was helmed by Julien Royer, the young current Jaan chef, and we liked his degustation menu just as much now. The Menu Prestige was a 7-course affair. as usual there were 2 great to super & very substantial amuse bouche, as well as a pre-desert, so it was no less a 10-course meal. the first amuse bouche was 3 small items – a rye cracker with a very nice hummus dip, another cracker & a wonderful eel with jelly stick & croquette.the second amuse bouche was a cepes mushroom tea. this was truly sublime with such intense flavours & the best soup I had ever taken anywhere.the FIRST course was prawn cannelloni on crustacean jelly decorated with ikura & topped with oscietra cavier. this was wonderful in taste as it was a beautiful picture to behold (see top photo). I did though find the jelly just a little bit salty.the SECOND course was a 55min (at 60degC) rosemary smoked organic egg with iberico chorizo. It had wonderful smoked rosemary flavour. the texture & flavour combination of a very smooth, somewhat sticky egg yoke with savoury chorizo was excellent.THIRD course was a bread & butter crusted Norwegian scallop with pumpkin puree, a great dish. the scallop meat was very sweet & totally consistent – looked like it was sous vide (vacuum low temperature cooking) then deep-fried.next, the FOURTH course was pan seared scallop in large bit-size pieces topped with strawberries & a very good fish broth or dashi stock – this was somewhat new variation to the usual caramelised version & it was easy to eat too with a spoon. the first Main – the FIFTH course was an excellent confit atlantic turbot with squid, grilled leek. they called it confit here but they were all sous vide to produce the very excellent consistency & sweetness. My wife liked this very much. I was a bit undecided as while it was good I might actually have preferred a good pan-seared version of this great fish. the second Main – the SIXTH course – was hay-roasted bresse pigeon confit leg with barley & morel mushrooms. I had always loved this dish, very sweet & tender both the breast & leg. again, it was sous vide then hay roasted. the barley was excellent touch. this was followed by a very nice pre-dessert sorbet palate cleanser.the SEVENTH & last course was a choconuts version 4 – different flavours of chocolates. every version at Jaan was good, basically it was just re-decoration of the same items but showing off the chef artistic plating skills. coffee was served with petite 4 - marshmallows, nutty chocolate, a rock melon sorbet stick, and a rosemary infused profitero lollipop.we managed to get window seat for the evening. the view was great! MBS, Esplanade, the Flyer – very enchanting skyline

We enjoyed the 5 course artisanal cuisine degustation menu. The food is truly first class: Burrata Spring 'Infusion', Quail & Foie Gras Ballotine, Confit Arctic Char, 48 Hours Confit Tajima Beef Short Ribs, 'Blossom' creation for dessert. We also enjoyed a plate of cheese from their very good selection. There is also an option of 7 and 9 course degustation, however all the additional food given at the start, I would recommend no more than 5 courses unless you're extremely hungry. We also selected the wine pairing, which I must say was a disappointment because the wine quality did not match the quality of the food. If you're a wine lover I would strongly recommend choosing from their extensive wine menu. The venue is small and intimate on the 70th floor with superb views of the Singapore flyer and Marina Bay Sands. I would recommend as a location for a very special occasion
5
Our foodie group decided this was as good a top-end meal as we have had in SE Asia. The wide ranging wine list had some great selections in all the price classes. The chef's dinner menus will change from day to day but everything we had was perfectly chosen, seasoned and cooked before being presented by a professional brigade. Our special requests (a fish eater, a bread devourer) were anticipated and indulged: our small gripe was that the portions were almost too bijou so if you're hungry you had better not skip lunch. The view is one of the the best in Singapore and the tables very comfortable and well spaced: booking by the window is the way to go. Overall access is shared with the cocktail bar on the next floor so by the time you leave you may end up sharing your elevator with the otherwise elevated going for a smoke: no matter, we had a good evening and even just about managed to keep back enough change for the taxi ......we were expecting it to be expensive and it was

This review may come in late but I wanted to share my great experience at Jaan. I celebrated a special occasion last year at this establishment and it was also my first time to dine there. Needless to say, the service was exceptional! Of course there was also the food that was heavenly. Jaan is definitely one to consider if you want to celebrate any special moments in your life
5
We came for lunch after researching other high end options. The lunch 5 course degustation is closer to 8 with the chef's additions. We requested a window view - make sure to ask for the view on the Marina Bay side as this is amazing. Very small restaurant with only 14 tables which made it feel like private dining and the tables are well spaced. The food was amazing and unique and definitely recommend as it was the highlight of our trip
5
This is not your everyday meal restaurant...this is 1 of the finest fine dining restaurants in Singapore. The view from the restaurant is simply amazing....at 70th floor, you can see beautiful skyline of Singapore.The food??As stunning as the view...having said it is a fine dining restaurant, actually the portion is quite generous,of course it taste fantastic.Book early to have a window seat and start enter the restaurant at 6.30PM so you can enjoy the sunset while having a glass of wine or champagne

I took my wife for lunch to Jaan. The service was absolutely perfect and the highlight of our visit. The great food and a wonderful view made this a great visit.The set lunch is very good value for money. Call ahead to try and get a place by the window. Highly recommended

I just came back from my asian trip where I pass by Osaka and Singpore. In osaka I was delighted by an amazing dinner time in the Tavola 36 at the Swissotel Nankai Osaka, where the quality of the service, the view where amazing.Even the chef and restaurant manager were able to come and take time for disucssing with me. As I was passing singapore I wanted to renew this experience in the Swissotel Stanford, but the service was not as good as the one in Osaka. they might need to share tips in order to improve.Nonetheless, the food quality was correc

Great decor with beautiful ceiling lighting. Amazing view of Marina Bay Sands & the surrounding area! The 3-hr meal easily fly by with fantastic food, artistic presentation, good wine & killer view. It is the place to go to impress. The degustation menu with wine pairing is as delightful as can be. It is obvious that each dish is crafted with skill. The perfect choice of wine made by the sommelier brings out the taste of each dish.If you only have 1 place to splurge, this is the place
4
Superb, but not cheap!Degustation menu which can include wine pairing & up to a dozen courses all considered!!Book ahead requesting a window table & allow 3 hours for dinner....then just go with the flow....The best meals I've had probably anywhere! Ever!Visited on four occasions in the last 2 years & will definitely go back for more

Had the 5 course artisanal lunch menu. Best lunch and dining experience in Singapore.
Good value for money. Reserve ahead.

We went to Jaan and enjoyed a fabulous culinary experience with an amazing view. We enjoyed the 7 course tasting menu - amazing. Each course was an experience. The service was fantastic with a special shout out to Aran, one of the assistant managers. The passion of the team showed in all aspects. It was an evening we will remember for years to come. Thank you to the team

Last night a most amazing dinner ( that became an event) with a friend. It started at 7:30 PM and we finished at 11:00 PM. The most accommodating staff I have experienced in the 2.5 years that I have lived in Singapore.The food (5 course set menu) and wine (paired with each course ) was just delightful, unexpected in the presentation and surprising in taste
5
We had the lunch menu just last week.winter gardens were full of flavours.beef short ribs were amazingly tender and juicy.There was an egg dish in the starters which another table ordered and it definitely had the wow effect.My partner had fish for starters (salmon caviar) and main (dory). It was not great, but satisfactory. Chestnut dessert tasted more like earl grey ice cream. We loved the mushroom infused tea (i'm sorry i don't remember what it was called.) and board of chocolates. rosemary chocolate and sorbet with "poppers" was extremely refreshing. The "poppers" reminded us of our childhood and we had a good laugh.The manager service was outstanding. the other wait staff has room for improvement.all in all, well deserving of being in the world's top 50
5
We went to Jaan as a table of 8 for the 5 course degustation. The setting was intimate and the view beautiful- we could see all the ships in the harbour at dusk and then all the city lights and even fireworks at night. The food was amazing- each dish a work of art and explained to us in detail. The matching wines superb. Staff were attentive and very professional. It wasn't just dinner, it was a great experience.
5
We have been to Jaan's a few times before - but it is first time with Chef Julien Royer in the kitchen. As such we knew what to expect about the wonderful view and the great atmosphere. However the food was great. We selected the 7 course menu with wine pairing. We had a wonderful evening with many create dishes of great taste and presentation with a good selection of wines to match... All wonderful. Also the service was great and most of the time very attentive. Especially we enjoyed the knowledge about the food by the staff and the German head waiter was a a delight... We look forward to your next trip... and I can recommend use "Feed at Raffles" membership to help pay the bill - which is not cheap..
5
I was a bit nervous coming to this restaurant, as I was worried that Iâ€™d be paying too much and get little value in return. I was wrong. It was truly excellent! The atmosphere was amazing, from the ceilings to the table to the magnificent view. The food was well prepared, and very delicious. We had the seven course menu as we wanted to try as many as possible. While the food was very good (and worth the price), the wine as a bit too expensive. The staff was very attentive, and the chef, who came out to greet us, was polite and charming. It was once in a life time experience, and well worth the money paid

Read more about Jaan on my blog at ms-skinnyfatOur meal is designed by Chef de Cuisin Julien Royer, a young chef who brings with him the unique taste of Cantal, Auvergne, France. Growing up on a farm developed in him a great appreciation of pure and organic ingredients and 'simplicity' (so he says) in his dishes. Seasonal ingredients are used to ensure freshness and thus the flavors will be different each quarter you visit. Here is our 7 course Winter Prestige Menu.We had 3 Amuse Bouche before the start of our 7 course meal. Sheesh!My stomach was starting to fill up a little by the time our first course came. Wild Caught Langoustine and Avocado Canneloni, served on top of a light crustacean jelly, ikura and Oscietra Caviar. This is a light seafood dish which is served cold. I like how the jelly is bisque infused. Needless to say i polished every bit of this. 2nd Course is one of my favorite dishes from Jaan. One of their signatures too. The 55' Rosemary Smoked Organic Egg with smoked rattes, autumn mushrooms and chorizo iberico. Perfect breakfast food that i would eat any time of the day. The smoked rosemary reminded me of our previous experience at Mikuni (read it here).Many dishes in between...Desserts was the 4th Generation of Choconuts, a staple at Jaan but it is currently on its version 4. Sable Breton, textures of white, milk and dark chocolate in biscuit, crumble, aerated, creamed, meringue, flakes and ice cream form. There was also a surprise with those crackly pops in the chocolate bits.There are about 3 menus to pick from and the minimum is a 5 course for dinner. I kinda regretted not doing that as there is some wagyu or beef short ribs and you know how i love my red meats (not pigeon). So yea. Jaan, great place for the special occasion
5
Ate a few times here and will for sure come back. Wine pairing is perfectly chosen. Great views. Food clearly took a lot of work to make. Book in advance though to get a window seat.
5
We had a fantastic meal here. At the top of the Equinox Centre, 70 floors high with tremendous views of course. The best part was thanks to good advice we lunched there. Cost S$85 from memory. Dinner, similar food, maybe 1 course more is S$250.This is Michelin class food, 2 star at least and the service was 3 star. Don't miss it. And guys, remember no matter how hot it is, you can't wear shorts. They had to lend me some pants
5
Went to Jaan on date night with my wife. Pleasantly surprised to be assigned a window seat upon arrival, as I was told that all window seating has been taken when I made reservation 4 days earlier. We had the 5 course degustation menu, skipped the cheese platter as we were too full by then. The dishes were exquisite, complementary mixture of flavoring, just the right portion and each dish was explained (lovingly ?) to us by the server. The highlight was the tajima beef short rib, melts in the mouth. I reckon beats the kobe beef from mon cher ton ton of Tokyo.Service was excellent with exceptional service from the restaurant manager, he went out of his way to entertain our request.Reckon the restaurant can do with a revamp of the deco, it looks and feel kind of sparse and cheap with the existing deco
5
Probably one of the best fine food restaurant in Singapore , on one of tje top floor of Swiss hotel !A fantastic diner done by Julien Royer and his excellent sous chef : Kirk !I really enjoyed this diner , which was on any point perfect 
5
Excellent Excellent.!! Nothing that I could point my finger at, not that I wanted to either，This was one of the most superlative dining experiences I have ever had. We were also amazed by the food taste and its presentation， I was highly pleased with the service。I think we had around 7 or 8 courses and each one was simply delightful， each dish is a new surprise. The view from the 70th floor was spectacular, The french touch at its best!!!

I had flown half way around the world to meet up with my girlfriend for the first time in months. I did research quite a bit ahead of time to find the perfect place to pop the question. We could not have picked better than Jaan. First off let me say the price is expensive. Accept this is so and therefore you will not worry as the evening goes on. The mood was 5 star. We were provided a view by the window where we could also watch the laser show. We started with a a glass of Dom. We chose the 7 course setting because of many of the dishes included were appealing, despite the fact it had pigeon which is not my favorite. Later chef Julian proved to me this can be a superb part of a meal when done correctly. We had wine pairing with the meal and we're introduced to two great wines a shiraz and a Riesling. The staff were attentive charming and created a repore with us easily. The food was great in each serving especially the mushroom soup, the scallop and the pigeon. My girlfriend was falling for chef Julian during the meal with each serving and was delighted he came out to serve the main course. When privacy was required to it was done with discretion. In the end ourselves and a couple next to us who also were getting engaged had the perfect setting and meal to remember. Don't miss a chance for eating at Jaan even if you are not getting engaged. BTW she said yes

Le Chef et cuisine - Chef Julien and his team share one belief: Products, products and nothing but the best products! Obsiblue prawns, scallops, turbot, caviar, organic egg, foie gras, white truffles from Alba, Brittany blue lobster, Challandais duck, Bresse chicken and pigeon, milk fed lamb etc. For those into haute cuisine with top quality products, you will experience true value at JAAN.Chef's style is modern with traditional ways of cooking (from farming background). Creative (of course!)...simple, definitely SIMPLE by showcasing the high quality products, playful, a hint of Bras (all the way from Aubrac region in France), a thinking chef...he always plans ahead what to cook for us and has a passion to prepare the best for all his guests with his Sous Chef Kirk.Service à JAAN - With Steven just left, JAAN service is now led by Max Bluemel with his German dedication and service quality. Attentive, discrete and with much thought process going into making all guests feeling special and being served. Max inspects every single piece of handmade tableware and cutlery, ensuring the sparkle from the crystal wine glasses and presenting every course of the Chef's creations to us in great detail. Max goes the extra mile to work with different departments within the hotel to fulfil our requests

The views are great but the food is truly awesome. The portions are sufficient and very well prepared. It ranks amongst the better meals we had in recent months and we were happy at the end of the prestige menu. Price wise it is expensive especially the wine menu but this issue cuts across the entire dining scene in SG unfortunately. The only setback to the evening was the unrefilled wine and water cups, and i have to agree with earlier comments that a cheaper choice of champagne would have been great for Jaan. We highly recommend it, just be prepared to pay lots at the end

Came with a party of 4 to celebrate an occasion. First time at the restaurant and had heard that it was good but expensive. Anyhow, getting to the place on a Friday evening in Singapore was bad enough but that's besides the point. The restaurant itself is located on the top floor of the hotel and the view of the water and skyline was fantastic. The restaurant itself was minimally decorated and gave off a very sterile vibe. Plus it was just a little too quiet for my liking. You couldn't even have a decent conversation without worry of disturbing the silence of the place. Next came the menu....now having lived in New York City and dined in many of its fine establishments, the prices quoted for their tasting menu made my eyes buldge a little. Even some of the best 3 star michelin restaurants in NY don't charge these prices but I guess in Singapore everything a little classier commands exorbitant prices. Anyhow, went for the chef's surprise tasting menu and the food was good but nothing exeptional. Perhaps the most memorable thing was the tab at the end of the evening, which, like the view, was nothing short of spectacular
5
This time its was a Boxing Day dinner with family...at what better place to go to then Jaan on top of the Swissotel! I had been there before, sometimes a luncheon, for dinner to celebrate a birthday or a business deal. Again the dinner was excellent. To celebrate the occasion we choose the ten course menu and were not disappointed. Accompanied by an excellent Meursault we enjoyed Onzen eggs, Foie Gras, Sea bass filet, Scallops, Beef, delectable cheese and great deserts (among others:)). All dishes were beautifully prepared and presented with aplomb by Max... Excellent service in two languages, knowingly, graceful and with a lot of humor. Well worth the (somewhat larger amount of) money..
5
Business lunch at Jaan was an unique experience. The view from the 70th floor was spectacular, as was the molecular/fusion kitchen. One of the finest lunch experiences ever. A must if you visit Singapore.
5
This is an excellent restaurant, one of the best in Singapore,
and the price for a set menu at lunchtime is quite reasonable,
for an 'haute cuisine' restaurant.
Great view, great service, delicious food. Will go again.
3
The setting is quite spectacular, panoramic view of the city, absolutely stunning. The food whilst very creative and presented with lots of theatre, was somehow missing something.
Winelist was also slightly disappointing, all very generic and quite expensive.
Overall, a pleasant experience.

Its been a while since i want to eat in Jaan. I think since andre chiang era. Now jaan is under julien royer.The food was good. I took 5 courses dinner set. They have 5, 7 and degustation one. For me 5 is just perfect. Not so much and not too little. The amuse bouche was one of delicious amuse bouche ever!! The wine also good. I took a bottle of burgundy wine. It was just perfect and got along with the food.The ambience was good. Good view of singapore city light, jaan is located at 70 floor of swissotel, and the modern french dinning interior.The lack only the selection of the food is not so much. But still the quality and the taste is incomparable. Once restaurant in singapore that you have to try. =

It was our first visit after chef AndrÃ© left and we were very positively surprised. We ate the prestige menu (7 courses) and each course was just great : creative cuisine with french ingredients and great, sometimes unexpected blends. What a great meal. Portions are small which is necessary when you eat 7 courses. We were too full to take on the optional cheese at the end. Also the desert was outstanding. We had a table at the window with a great view. THere is one thing I would recommend the management of Jaan urgently : we wanted to drink a glass of champagne before the diner though they only serve Dom Perignon or Krug at 65 dollars a glass. There is Moet et Chandon brut imperial for 30 dollars per glass on the menu card but it is not available. "only in the bar" was the answer, in the restaurant, only champagne which comes at 65 dollars a glas. Come on ! You cannot take 2 glasses from the bar and serve it ? Then we decided to skip the aperitif. A very negative first impression of a very positive overall dinner... Fix it, please

My wife and I dined at Jaan a couple of days ago and ordered the 10 course Chef's surprise menu. We were devoted visitors to Jaan when Chef Andre was there and while we have visited for lunch a couple of times since he left, this was the first time we had been back for dinner.The evening started well with an interesting selection of amuse bouche and a table by the window. We had:- Course 1: Avocado and Langoustine Canelloni - enjoyable and a nice start to the meal; very mild flavours, might have benefited from some acid for bite but still nice- Beetroot composition - like the concept but the flavour disappointed lacking any variation and while a variety of textures were presented, needed some crunch- Walnut crusted diver scallop - not bad, I liked the apples for some sweetness and tartness - Confit Artic Char - fairly dull, really lacked flavour and texture - Smoked Organic Egg - great presentation albeit didn't really get Roesmary in the flabour; however overall the dish was nice but slow cooked egg dishes are becoming quite common and this didn't really have any originality attached to it- Bresse Pigeon - this was the only main course. Nicely presented as a whole in a dish prior to being plated. Well cooked and nice garnishes but nothing memorable about it. And when having a 10 course meal one is looking for an indulgent main course, and the pigeon just didn't really hit the spot- Cheese course - one slide of truffled brie. It was nice but as part of a 10 course meal, I'd expected a proper cheese course with the offer of a selection - the one paltry slide was disappointing- Pre-dessert - this was described as a palate cleanser. If so, a palate cleanser should not be counted as a course. Anyway it consisted of sponge cake topped with come coconut merringue 
5
Great views accompany and excellent meal on top of the Swissotel. This is fine dining at its best and all I can say is that the price is justified because we walked away from our meal absolutely blown away. No words can do justice to the magic created in this kitchen.
4
I believe that the bread should be served before the 1st course is served? No? Well other than that, everything else was great. The servers were sharp and attentive. I mentioned servers as there were not a specific one or two that was taking care of us(only 2 of us) as all of them did which I would say creates a little confusion
5
We celebrated our 25th anniversary at Jaan. We had lunch there. Eventhough I called the day of, they graciously gave us a nice table with a view!!! We had the 5 course lunch. Including all the surprise additions, it was more like an 8 course. It was one surprise after another, totally a feast for the eyes and tastebuds. The best food my husband and I ever had in our lives!! The view is breathtaking as well! The value was outstanding at 88 Singapore dollar per person. The service was outstanding. They even gave us a piece of cake with a candle for our celebration. Knowing we probably cannot put more food in our stomach. They said they would box it for us to take home. I would definitely go again every time I am in Singapore
5
I have had a few high end meals in my life, but I think my meal at Jaan was the best. Each dish was perfectly prepared, and had subtle flavours that were a joy to experience. A lot of "fine dining" tends to overload you with intense and rich flavours that in the end make you feel a bit sick, Jaan soesnt do that, instead it takes great ingredients and fantastic chef's and makes for a perfect evening or lunchtime meal. Stunning stuff
3
Really, really, really, really very expensive!! The food was OK, it was very good but the place is really very expensive!
4
A feast for the eyes & tongue is how I would describe the meal. Each course was creatively presented & well explained. An amazing meal which does its creator proud. The view from each table is spectacular.However, service does not quite match up to the high standards of the food. We had to ask for a wine list twice, water & coffee were spilled on the table. The biggest letdown was when we had to walk out of an empty restaurant (around 2pm) without any service staff to see us out
5
The 3 course lunch special here is amazing value - you get the three course, plus chef's welcome gift, amuse bouche and misgsardes at the end of the meal as well. All with the million dollar views over the Marina.The food itself is very modern and with fun touches too, so all in all a great package for a great price.If you've ever wondered what fine dining is all about and would like to find out without breaking the back, this is the ideal way to do it
5
We had a Saturday lunch there with friends, and it was simply fantastic. I think we had around 7 or 8 courses ( I lost count) and each one was simply delightful. Chef Julien's creativity is truly magnificent. The presentations are just spectacular. Combined with the very attentive and genuine service provided by manager Max and his team made for an absolutely brilliant way to spend our Saturday afternoon. Max took the time to explain each one of the components of each dish, which made enjoying them so much easier and although I am a foodie I actually learned something that afternoon. The wine pairing was simply a match made in heaven and a must if you enjoy the degustation menu. Combine all this magic in a pot and add one of the most amazing views of the city and you end up with true luxury. My friends and I already have plans to return and we can’t wait to savour more of this truly outstanding gourmet templ
5
This is quite honestly the most amazing food! It was presented beautifully and the service was exceptional. The view from the restaurant is really special. I would highly recommend having the wine pairing because the wine complimented the food so well. Every dish was explained to us and made us feel so important. Thank you so much for an unforgettable dinner
5
Had an eight course dinner by Chef Julien Royer. Everything from the minute we stepped into the restaurant was fantastic - the atmosphere, the view from the 70th floor, the impeccable service, and needless to say, the magic of Chef Julien's wand. Each course was interesting, yet spectacular with the use of the freshest ingredient imported from around the world. His flavors were very complex and had lots of texture. Highlights were the intense mushroom soup, the smoked organic egg, crusted langoustine, and passionfruit marshmallow. (I'm not a fan of marshmallow but this is out of this world!) IMHO, this is one of the best meals I've had . Definitely, comparable to any Michelin restaurant
5
We went there on a Friday for lunch time and we tried the 5 courses menu (which hides a few additional surprises). The chef shows a real passion for food and various ingredients. He builds intricate and complex flavorful dishes. Each dish is a new surprise. Savor mixes with textures to offer you a great experience of French fine cuisine. Service is both refined and efficient and the overall experience is beyond expectation for the price.Reading some reviews, we think they missed the point: this place could compare to Michelin stars French restaurant at a very reasonable price, just realize it's not just food but a real fine artisanal cuisine experience 
4
The food is great and we enjoyed the scenic view and excellent service.We've tried few items and personally I liked the fish. The starters were yummy and great with the recommended wine (Pinot noir). By the way take note of the menu is diff compared to their website. If you wish to have a lunch meeting this is one of the best place

For the complete article and more photos, please visit http://PAOtotheLO.wordpress.com/2012/03/23/jaan/Located on the 70th floor (Equinox Complex) of Swissotel at The Stamford in Singapore, Jaan is an intimate 40-seater restaurant that offers artisanal French cuisine.Dining at Jaan is truly a wonderful and unique experience – it appeals to both the eyes and the tongue. Beautifully plated dishes, made with the finest ingredients, that’s what Jaan is all about.They're having a 3-course set lunch menu every weekday which is relatively cheaper than dining there for dinner with the ala carte menu. The meal works out to be 7 course with all the freebies that they included so i must say that its value for money
4
While in Singapore my family and I wanted to experience a Michelin starred restaurant for the first time and so we opted for Jaan. It was a 3 course lunch which turned out to be a AUD$100 bill per person which was a bit extravagant. However the food was beautiful, interesting and sometimes interactive. I asked the waiter if the bread was made in house but found out it was shipped from France which I'm a bit surprised about still. The view was great from the 70th floor of the Stamford Hotel, but overall a good first time experience that I wouldn't redo to be honest
3
I can say the food is just so-so, not really good. The service.................you do not feel this restaurant is located in the hotel. My honey and I won't come back next time.
5
For our wedding anniversary , an unforgettable experience . A special menu prestige with 12
course....all surprises ! Chef Julien Royer is an young talented Chef !
3
Food is Michelin 2 star standard. But the front-of-house isn't doing the chef justice and the place needs a sommelier. Ordered the 7-course tasting and some wine that was recommended on the wine pairing. The wine was stale, and towards the end the waitress served me the petit four while I was still eating my dessert. When I asked why, she just kept insisting it's for after dessert, even when I said "Isn't it obvious I'm not done with dessert?
5
I went the few years back with my ex bf,it was recommend by our friend. It was by far the most excellent meals I had. We had the tasting menu it was absolutely perfect,a really awesome dining experience! I recommend the place to my friends and hope to be back again one day! Now I have to save $$$ first.
4
If you enjoy fine dining, with a spectacular view and good service....Jaan is the place to go. We had the 5 course lunch which was outstanding value at $88 plus service/ taxes. Everything from the snacks at the start, through to the breads, amuse bouche, the devine mains and the desert and the petit fours were outstanding. The only blight on the meal was that the waiter automatically opened a second bottle of sparkling water without checking with us first. A small but significant detail which stopped us giving 5 stars.Highly recommended. :-
5
I have eaten in a number of Michelin star restaurants before and i must say Jaan has ranked my number 1! From the moment i stepped foot on the 70th floor i was mesmerized by the breathtaking view of the Chic Cosmopolitan city of Singapore. My boyfriend and I enjoyed the 10 course taster menu whilst sipping on Don Perrignon, every dish bursting with flavor never failed surprise me. with the huge variety of choice on the taster menu i'm positive everyone would be highly satisfied! The waiting staff looked after us extremely well and added a personal touch to our dining experience.Jaan really hit the spot and i would definitely recommend it to a friend!
5
Just had dinner there yesterday. Had the 10 course surprise menu – the surprise was theirs, we don’t eat meat! No problem though. Had an amazing meal accompanied by an awesome Dujac. Service was absolutely top Michelin standard. Extraordinarily knowledgeable staff from the bread waiter to the Maitre. Julien Royer at just 29 years must have an awesome career in front of him – I look forward to following it when he returns to his native Cantal. Oh and there is an amazing view and great wine but these things are easily overlooked while enjoying the food
5
We went for lunch in a week day and we were surprised to see the restaurant almost full.After having lunch we really understood why it was full. The food was great and from the Amuse bouche to the desserts and petits fours you are amazed by all the flavours and combination you can get in the plats.So far the best table in town... and not so expensive for lunch...We will go back again and again..
5
We had a wonderful dinner. The view over Singapore is amazing! The staff is thoughtful and available.And the food!..... Chef Julien is very gifted: he associates french traditional products with ingredients from all over the world to achieve the perfect combination! Each course is a surprise and a delight!The french touch at its best!!!
5
We ate here off the cuff one night and decided to go for the full 10 course surprise menu - with wine pairings.6 glasses of wine and a glass of champagne I can barely remember what we ate but we enjoyed it - a lot!I won't ruin the surprise for those of you to take try this menu but do be warned, with the pairings, our bill came to $1300 for 2 - eek!yummy though
4
As the title says, great food. Service was good but seemed a little stressed... no big deal though as my and my wife enjoyed it.
2
Either fusion food is really not my taste or the food is really not up to standard. Expensive place too. Presentation was impressive but there is nothin to die for... Won't go there anymore. Once is enough!
5
From the moment that we were welcomed to Jaan, we could not complain about anything. We were lucky enough to have been seated by the window overlooking Marina Bay at night. We chose a 7 course degustation menu and enjoyed every single course. The menu was well planned and perfectly executed. The colours, textures and flavors were all perfectly balanced. Rather than take the time that was needed to fully investigate the extensive wine list, we left our choice the sommelier. He chose wines that we would never have ordered ourselves and each one complimented our food perfectly.The service was seamless. It was attentive, yet discreet and professional. When a large group seated nearby were louder than is considered polite in such an intimate venue. the manager quietly requested that they the things down before any demands were made by other diners. The manager, waiting staff and chef are all charming and proficient.Sadly, we never made it to the cheese course having over indulged on food and wine over the previous hour or two. I guess it gives us a good excuse to go back.Jaan is not cheap, but you get what you pay for. This is not the venue for an everyday or rushed meal; it is the place to go when you really want to experience something special, savour the food and delight in the service
5
As a starter we had a wild mushroom tea with porcini sabayonAn Atlantic mackerel, horseradish and pickled blueberryA trumbetta zucchini with burratta cheese and black olive sugarAn Atlantic cod with broad beans and baby squid gremolataA wild langoustine with slow cooked egg yolk, fregola sarda and white truffeA smoked rosemary scallop with reinette apple and boudin noirA as a sweet note for the end a choconuts with jivara mousse and dark chocolate sauce thanks and Mango tube with caramel sale sauce.....Let me tell you all about this place “Jaan” a jewel for the palate. I never experience something like that in Singapore. I was really impressed…I heard many times about Jaan and never really get the chance to go, and my lovely husband surprised me on a Saturday. The view is fantastic except that, that day was storming but then I thought!!!! that will help me to concentrate more on the food.I didn’t need much concentration my palate was in heaven. I was jumping on my chair. Every dish was divine seriously!!! I’m not exaggerating. I was really really pleased and trust me I’m really picky with the food, very particular with what I eat. Every dish brings you somewhere, there so much details of course it’s a fine food restaurant right but even you kind of expect something like nice...the flavors were “exquisite” the combination of the condiments, the sauce, the garnishing etc.…was just to good to be true. I’m sorry if that seems to be toooo much but I really enjoyed it, was a long time for me that I was not bluffed by a restaurant.My husband is more than a “foodist”, he has more than knowledge about food, food is his passion and when I mate him I was Vegetarian…so eating veggies all the time when we were going to the restaurant. I was feeling something bad because I couldn’t really share the same experience with him but after long effort, patience and love he changed my way of eating and now I enjoy differently and I love that we can share that together. Sharing a meal with friends and your loved ones is such a pleasure!!!I wanted to share this beautiful experience at Jaan with you because I really believe that, the Chef behind Julien Royer deserve to be known for his talent. Hope that The Michelin Guide will stop by one day because as a young and talent Chef he should get something, this nice Fine food experience considering the young Chef.And trust me I have tried restaurants here and there and because of this Young talented chef this is one of the best here in Singapore. Again this experience is based and my judgment and my palate I’m not trying to convince any one.Thank you love, for bringing me there!!!! Hoping for more experience like this
4
Went for the 14 course meal. Portions looked small but after 12 courses, not including desserts, I was really full! Deliciously prepared and ingredients of the dishes tasted fresh and of high quality. Since it is located on the 70 something floor, you dine with spectacular view of Singapore. If it not too hazy, I bet you can even see Indonesia in the distance! A bit pricey but a good experience nonetheless
5
We lunched at Jaan with friends overlooking the stupendous view. The food however was outstanding. The lunch is an absolute bargain: S$52++ for three courses,is a steal. Yes wine is expensive on the island and for Aussies used to bargain price quality that is a bit hard bit there is a range on the cute iPad wine list. The signature lamb has a $10 charge but even so the total meal costs less than the a la carte for one main course. Enough about costs.From the interest of the pre lunch appetiser a sort of mushroom enhanced cocktail to the petit fours it was all class. The obvious attention to every detail you would expect was there. The flavours and contrast of texture,balance and finesse are all exemplary. I think the lunch is a steal and you would be mad not to give it a go
5
This is a wonderful restaurant for a special occasion, with amazing food, great view, impeccable service. But it also very expensive - we spent $700 for 4 of us, just main course and 1 bottle of wine. There were a lot of 'amuse bouche' etc elemetns thrown in, so we were well fed, and very happy, but somewhat surprised at the prices - mains 80 to 110, wine pricing starting at 140. All in all, great choice for a special occasion

I recently went to Jaan for dinner, and I have to shout to the world about the wonderful experience we had!It has recently been taken over by a new Chef by the name of Julien Royer and I trust this guy will make some noise in the Singapore culinary landscape.From the moment we arrived we were warmly greeted by a host who showed us to our table facing the Marina, you should definitely ask for a table with a view if you can, it adds up to the charm of the restaurant.The dining room is simple yet elegant; you can tell right away that the focus is on quality. From the table cloth to the show plate, it is pure elegance!After a precise and exciting description of the menu by the Manager we decided to go for the Prestige Menu, a 8 courses menu!Usually when I go for these long degustation dinners, I feel full half way through, and most of the time I do not really enjoy the last couple of courses, usually the mains and deserts, which is a real shame when you pay that can of price… Well I have to say that for this one, it was just pure delight from the first to the last course and I enjoyed every moment of it. This is due to the menu being light, well crafted and well portioned, and more especially due to the focus of the Chef on the flavors. Respect of the product really translates in the plate; it is all about details, purity of taste and perfect execution of both traditional and innovative cooking techniques. In simple words, you know what you are eating!Not forgetting about the plating, in that area again, The Chef really excels. His creativity exceeds all expectations. I won’t describe the entire menu, but you will be surprised with associations of colors, textures and the amazing show they have put around the smoked scallops in rosemary… which are served in still burning rosemary branches at the table! Fantastic!! All of this is greatly enhanced by the amazing service staff. I find it rare to get professional and naturally pleasant service in Singapore even in fine dining restaurants. It is usually either too pretentious or too formal to the point that you can even feel uncomfortable or the service staffs lack of knowledge about the products they are selling. Here you will be well taken care of, from the waiters to the sommelier to the excellent Restaurant Manager Steven who makes you feel incredibly at ease with his hilarious sense of humour! The passion of the Chef is transported all the way from the kitchen to the table by the service staff; you can really feel that they are proud to serve his cuisine and they do it in a very professional manner without pushing you to order anything, just feeding you with all the information you want. Well… real first class service! The Chef also came by to have a quick chat with all the tables. Nice touch…From the unique concept of amuse bouche to the mouth-watering petits fours, the experience is truly a journey through gastronomy excellence.I think I can safely say I have tried most of the fine dining restaurants in Singapore, but this one really stands out. It is definitely a place to go for a romantic occasion or simply to celebrate great food with loved ones.Highly recommended

My wife and I recently ate at Jaan. While the food isn't the best we've ever had (French Laundry is safe there!), it is certainly well done. Really our only complaint would be the portions on the tasting menu were appropriately small until the final course, which was huge. Not that we minded having plenty of it, it just seemed out of place.As others have mentioned, the view, especially at night, is fantastic

We went to dinner 2 days ago and while the service was very good, especially the Sommelier, and we enjoyed the great view, the food was not on par with the expectations.We have a bit of experience with very good restaurants, went to quite a few restaurants in the top 50 list, in different countries.Jaan is not even in the same class of restaurant, for a French restaurant that can not cook foie gras properly (over cooked), the beef short ribs were terrible (very tough and tasteless) the veal had no taste due to the pairing, the langoustine was like mash, the only thing they did get right was the pigeon and the wild mushroom tea.We got the wine pairing and were surprised that of the 5 wines 3 were Australian, 1 Spanish and only 1 French, and this @ over $400/person

Tignanello double the price of fine restaurants metres away, say no more. You can pay alot less for this view.

I didn't particularly like the food when I went there last time. But I read that the chef has changed. Would go back to try again

Nice view... Was there for a lunch session, heard that they changed a new chef since I last went in 2007. Very exquisite and nice menu but overall, I find the food kinda bit too saltish for my taste.

The Service is excellent and the view is still breathtaking which oversees majestic skyline of MBS. The new Chef from France has done well in creating the dishes from the old menu of Jaan Par Andre. Were told that the new chef is creating his new menu and am eager to return

We ate at Jaan as a part of our weekend away for my birthday and we were very pleased with our choice. We had the seven course degustation and added a truffle course as well. The view from the restaurant is truly phenomenal. We have eaten at a number of the top 100 San Pellegrino restaurants in the past couple of years and hubby wanted to try one of the Singaporean ones. We love to taste. We love the theatre of truly fine dining. Of course, with regards to Jaan, there is much talk of the change of chef if you read the Internet chat, and hubby was a little concerned when he booked it as a surprise. The chef who got the restaurant to its lauded status as a top 50 restaurant in the world, has left. So entering with a little trepidation, we were both very impressed with the overall story of the meal and the service. Steven, the manager, was excellent and attentive to all patrons. He, and his staff, walked the room and explained dishes in great detail and when asked, he was honest about the change of chef. We weren't the only ones to ask! We found out that Steven has taken over the reins as manager in the last month and we were interested to hear his views and we were very impressed with the service and his view that the chef, Ebbe Vollmer, is evolving the menu. It is an evolution that we were certainly impressed by.The food was excellent. Yes, the new chef must be finding his feet, as he has huge expectations to live up to, but I was impressed with his choice of dishes and the flavour combinations/ profiles on offer. The movement through the courses was well paced and thoughtful. The avocado carpaccio was phenomenal and I could have eaten a lot lot lot more. The Boudin blanc sausage was divine. The rabbit had no gaminess to it at all and a beautiful texture with subtle flavours. The scallop was perfectly cooked (how hard it seems for some other top chefs to cook the humble scallop at times!) . I have never had Kinki fish, but that was a revelation. I usually hate lamb, but the lamb course was quite honestly the only time I have ever eaten a whole course of lamb (my husband usually enjoys two plates if there is lamb in a degustation) and I enjoyed the desserts. Saucing is where French fusion food really gets me and Jaan certainly delivered. I could have done with a sauce spoon on a couple of occasions as licking plates is not really an option. We have eaten at the big name chef restaurants as well. We have been to French Laundry with chef Keller was in the kitchen. We have eaten at Per Se a couple of times. Gagnaire has been out to introduce himself. Ducasse has been working his magic behind the scenes and we are part of the fortunate few to experience L'Astrance. We have eaten at Robuchon restaurants on three continents and I we had a two week holiday in October where we experienced 18 Michelin stars. I firmly believe that the chef at Jaan needs to revel in showing his culinary voice and take the restaurant in his direction unashamedly, because what we tasted was divine. I will be really interested to go back when we are next in Singapore

Located 70th floor at the Stamford swisshotel. Nothing beats the view here! Service is absolute top class, attentive but not intrusive. Had the 9 course degustation lunch menu and it was devine. Every course was explained in detail before you dig in. Wonderful presentation and very very nicely cooked. I can just imagine how romantic it must be in the evenings. A must try while in Singapore

We were really looking forward (and probably had slightly high expectations) to dinner when we dined at Jaan Restaurant last night. We had read an article recently that Jaan was voted one of the best restaurants in Asia this year. As we've been travelling for the past 2 months and have been eating quite local, we thought that we would treat ourselves to a fine dining experience with some of our friends. A couple of years ago we went to St Pierre when we were in town and loved it! Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for Jaan.We were very underwhelmed by the food. It was lovely presentation and looked beautiful to eat but it was boring. I actually thought that most of the dishes we had were under-seasoned too which is why I asked for S&P. When one dines at a top restaurant like this and pays SG$400 per person, we want all the dishes to be memorable - a taste sensation. You should be able to feel the sides of your mouth smiling and be delighted with each mouthful like someone's dancing in your mouth. Unfortunately, this didn't happen at all.For those of you who have dined at top restaurants you'll know what we mean. We've been lucky enough to dine at some of the top restaurants around the world. When we've eaten at Tetsuya's, The French Laundry, Joel Robuchon etc there's always been a certain 'je ne sais quoi' and we have walked away with wonderful memories of our meal. It doesn't even have to be a top restaurant. Here - nothing. I can't even think of a dish that I would remember. The caviar/ avocado/ almond first course was weird. It just didn't make sense nor add any delight to the palate. The pheasant boudin blanc was nice and perfectly cooked but you couldn't taste the pheasant at all. On a more positive note, the view from the restaurant is without parallel one of the best in Singapore and the dining room is quite elegantly decorated - simple but chic. The glass decoration on the ceiling was OK. The wine we ordered was delicious. The bread was good too especially the truffle brioche. Service was excellent without being too fussy. Perhaps a bit more warmth from the staff would have been better but it was very professional nonetheless.I really can't recommend Jaan as one of the top restaurants in Asia based on last night's performance

First of all I must precise that I am french and, as such, I may seem little bit fussy....... but I am not, am I?We have first tried this restaurant several months ago. At this time it was called the Jaan Paar Andre after the chef, Paar Andre.At this time we really enjoyed it. The portions were small but in every one there was something special, the chef's touch, that made every mouthful a delight for the taste buds. So even if it was not cheap, we really thought that it was worth it. We appreciate the creativity of the chef.Today, the chef has changed. The price is still high but we did not find anything to justify it. Don't misunderstand me, the food is good, on the new cuisine side. The portion are still small but the 7 courses menu is enough to satisfy you in terms of quantity.But we did not find anything special in the food that was served. Everything was something we had already found or tasted somewhere else. There was no creativity, no surprise, like the beetroot sorbet we had last time.In this kind of restaurant you accept to pay a high price because they serve something unique, that you can find nowhere else. But it was not the case. Everything they served us was common, something you find in an average restaurant in France. The only surprise was the avocado carpaccio with fresh almonds as a starter. But the mix of taste did not really workThe service was really really good, near perfection. But, to be honest, we did not find anything that would lead us to go again.Eric

This restaurant has been renamed Jaan Par Andre after chef Andre Chiang for a while now. Went for the lunch and found some courses to be excellent. Though some of the sides items were kind of imbalanced with the mains - it did not blend very well taste wise. However there were really some excellent items esp the braised beef.Service was really bad. The wait staff will be kinder to customers they select. Maybe the customers were regulars, maybe they looked richer, or the racial factor. Whatever reasons, it shows that their service is not up to fine-dining grade. I don't enjoy my meal with a snarling waitress who turns on the charm at the next second at another table.The chef is leaving the restaurant soon to start another of his own. So another name change should be in the works

I always enjoy my dinner at JAAN. Chef Andre creation is fantastic. The food is very balance, creative, good products selection and very well execute. What do you need more when you wanna find the real deal what is so called "Gastronomic Food" here in Singapore. This is defieniely the place to go

Over-rated and over-priced, only thing going for it is the fantastic view

Great for set lunches.

A special occasion place - you gotta love the crystal chandelier (think modern art, not Victorian or Louis XIV) and the view of Singers from the 71st floor. But then the food arrives, and its always a little out of the ordinary. Trust the sommelier - he knows his stuff. Veggies are well-catered for, and the lobster tartare we once had will always have a place in my top ten dishes of all time. Yes, its pricey - but every cent is well spent in my opinion

Went for my wife's birthday. The food was excellent. We had the degustation menu - 7 courses and you can opt for wine pairing, which we didnt. It's not cheap at S$240/pax +++ but if you have the FEED AT RAFFLES card, it's 1 for 1 for main meal, which means a saving of S$240. Each course is excellent in terms of taste, presentation and creativity. Definitely teh best French restaurant i've tried in SG
