Patronize this joint frequently for it being a unpretentious place for what they are known- “lobster porridge”. Set out amidst agricultural plots, do not expect 5 stars back drop or fine dining etiquette. Eat with your hands, be messy and be yourself. No complaints about the food, the service and the environment

Told the china lady that was serving us only 1 person eating the cold crab but she end up gave us one big crab for 52$ .. it's ok it's taste good still.. 2 buddy set is good enow gg for 3 person only 2 lobster in the porridge .. the porridge come in very big portion.. Steven chicken is a must order.. Service is not very good, they didn't even on the fans for us and it was so bloody warm lol.. indoor seatting only if u reserve weeks ago but I always see it's empty.. Guess they only want you to seat outside lol..Be prepare that there is a lot of houseflys .. very big houseflys swarming to you when ur food came lol..Located beside Khatib cab u can take bus 169 from opposite Yishun mrt only 5-6 stops and u can walk in.. there is not obvious signage but it's located in one of the garden farm.. first gate on the right of the road.Parking will be a problem if u come on peak hours

If you want quite place for lunch, this is not one as it is very popular given the ulu location. We called the cold crab and lobster porriage as their specialty. It is nice and especially when it was raining hard outside. Heard from the staff that Chef Steven don't come in as often now so was a bit sceptical if standard has been maintained. Luckily it was up to par and things taste good.

We decided not to patronise this place anymore even the lobster porridge is good. Lots of houseflies and the plates they served, alot of stain. Being such a well established seafood restaurant, they should have changed all the plastic plates (utensils) after using for long. You could see the plastics bowl and plates have stain on it. Quite disgusting to consume, will lose appetite. The waitress/waiter were not friendly at all. Lousy service overall. I am sure other price has good lobster porridge with better service. Not worth the visit! Not recommende

Tucked along a row of shophouses in a quiet residential estate in the north (near Jalan Kayu), this laid-back restaurant offers Chinese seafood delicacies and a comprehensive menu for families and for business. Signature dishes such as Lobster porridge, cold crab, Steven's chicken, steamed patin fish. The lobster porridge will cost - as in all lobster dishes anywhere else - but it is hearty comfort recipe that the young and old will approve. Not fine dining and stuffy. Service is friendly and helpful - call ahead and they will look out carpark lots for you. Check out their website:- http://www.orchidliveseafood.com.sg

Went to this small hidden place yesterday with my wife. It has an old rustic feel, and you are like transported back to the 80s' Singapore. We were there during lunch, so it was not so crowded. They are famous for their lobster porridge, cold crab and Steven's chicken. We decided to order the set menu for 2 pax, which cost $88. The porridge were those TeoChew hard rice style, soup based was seafood nice, and lobster meat were fresh. The chili mussel are spicy and fresh. Steven's chicken was crispy. The green is heavenly done, and looks like they're taken from the nearby orchid. Overall the portion is good for 2 males, but if you're eating with a lady, it might be a bit too much. We will come back again to try the cold crab

Imagine this view:- A kampung restaurant tucked in the middle of no where- Parking lots just right in front of the restaurant- Al fresco dinning with the vegetable farm just beside youThat's what you are going to get here! Yes, its very rustic but there is a certain charm about this place.Now, about the food. The lobster porridge is excellent! Very succulent lobsters and the soup was so good that we did not waste a single drop of it.Another highly recommended dish is Steven's chicken. Don't be fooled by the pictures, this chicken is one mean dish. The chicken was well marinated and extremely crispy. Definitely much better than any other marmite chicken that you can find out there.Now, what's bad:- We asked for a small plate of Steven's chicken, they said small was too little for our group and recommended the medium. In the end, they billed us for the large. Seems a little... unscruplous? :
