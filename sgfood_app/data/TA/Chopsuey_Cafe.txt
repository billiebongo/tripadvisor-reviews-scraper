Gorgeous setting, tasty food and drinks but let down by the laughable service (drinks and meals arriving at wildly different times, wrong drinks, having to remind staff of everything etc etc). Service needs to improve to justify the price range.
5
Restaurant was brilliant!!! Food was great however I think some dishes were pre-cooked as they arrived too quickly and a little cold. Service was amazing and very attentive and the decor was brilliant. Will be back
5
cool and refreshing ambiance, great food, low key but excellent all around. we especially liked the eggplant and tofu, and the beef and orange mains.
3
The food is very good but you cannot overcharge for sparkling water and serve 500ml only instead of the usual 750ml. These are the classical way to charge more to customers!
I like this place but this is unacceptable and something you should look into.

We ordered a dim-sum basket vegetarian and it was possible. It did not say it was possible but was done without any doubt. Food and service was amazing.

Aah the serenity. The Chopsuey Cafe is in a lovely, leafy surrounded location. It has a colonial feel. I celebrated my birthday here at lunch time. The service was friendly and the food tasted even better than it looked (it looked great). The desserts are absolutely decadent. If you have a sweet tooth then I recommend the pavlova with butterscotch sauce and passion fruit topping. I will definitely return to Chopsuey Cafe next time I'm in Singapore.Get 'Grab' app which is like 'Uber'. Its not far from Orchard Road ..just a short car ride though
5
Ate here with a group of friends, and from the reception to the food recommendations, and the food taste and quality, we enjoyed our time there. The setting certainly helps as well in an old black and white style building. Rebecka, our main server, was very enthusiastic and attended to us very well. Ate inside due to the humidity outside from the recent rainstorm, but would have been fine to eat outside as well. Decent selection of beers and wines as well. Will definitely be back

Party of four, we shared too many plates to list, but will note the octopus was tops, the vegetarian satay was second, and the short ribs.3rd, all excellent, and purely based on preferences. The layers of flavour were first rate.I strongly recommend this restaurant.Service, atmospheres, and location of our table in side was perfect.This is a must go for vegetarians mixed in a group of free eaters..Rice dish was special too
4
Really liked the design of this place - great spot to sit down for an hour and have a drink and snack. We tried the duck and orange dumplings (OK) and chicken and chive dumplings (good). I can't comment further on the food as that's all we tried but I would recommend visiting this place even if you just sit and relax over a drink and small bite to eat.

PS cafe has always been the place to go to for that colonial cafe feel, especially their branch at Dempsey. Chop Suey, under the same umbrella, is located within the same enclave and doesn't deviate from the tried and tested. So much about the decor. I was expecting Americanized Chinese food when I came (given the name) but was totally blown away by the roasted pork and toasted coconut salad I had for lunch. This place doesn't hold back on the chilli! And add to that different textures (pork rinds, grapefruit, apple slices, winged beans which can only be found this side of the world), you've got a winner! Service was also very good. The only drawback, as with all other ps cafes, is the price. Expect to pay 1.5 times more than what you would pay for the same quality of food. But hey, someone's gotta pay for that colonial setting
4
The food is great and it's in a great setting and location. The dishes are very small and the prices are on the expensive side too but that is what you expect for that area. Definitely worth going to if you're close.
5
Wow what a delightful little place amongst the tree top garden.
The service was outstanding. The food delicious. I had the lobster dim sum - best ever! Soft shell was delicious. The quality of food is worth the cost. I would certainly recommend.
4
Have now visited the restaurant for the second time, since my first experience wasn't that overwhelming.
Highly enjoyed the evening and service was much better than last time.
2
Our family of four did not have have a great experience. Our meals were average and the service was average. They also placed us at the worst table and we arrived at 6.15pm. The decor and restaurant itself is gorgeous, with a romantic outside deck and seating area. Take the Tropical strength Mosquito repellent!

I recommend the grated coconut pork belly salad. The dressing was tangy and cold, lettuce was fresh and the crispy pork was done just right. The seared prawn and spinach dumplings were soggy and underwhelming The crispy duck pow pockets were dry and tasteless until drowned in the sauce provided - think disappointing Peking duck with thick wraps.The orange beef was mediocre, although the sauce had an interesting kumquat flavour. Otherwise it was just deep fried skinny beef strips finished with a glazed citrus sauce.At the start of lunch, things were nice and quiet. With four additional tables occupied, it was already a struggle to carry out a conversation as voices and cutlery clatter began bouncing off the glass walls.Service was nondescript and the waitress failed to hear our order for tea and coffee ... probably because of the cacophony. When she finally came around again (they are woefully under-staffed) it was time for us to run.The restaurant is quite beautiful though, so I might come back one of the evenings for a drink and a leisurely dinner. This time I will sit outside to avoid the noise and enjoy the verdant surroundings. Hope the food will be better

On the recommendation of a local friend, my wife and I had dinner with friends at Chopsuey Cafe on Dempsey Road. Located in a decommissioned army barracks at the end of an impressive strip of restaurants, Chopsuey oozes character and has a great atmosphere. We sat outside on a balmy evening for dinner which added to the experience. There's a really impressive menu to cater for all tastes. We shared a range of starters and mains. The Duck Pancakes and San Choy Pau were standouts from our starters, with the Honey Ginger Chicken and Smoked Fish Fried Rice the pick of the mains. We selected a lovely Pinot Noir to complement the meal from a good wine list, and prices are comparable with equivalent restaurants (wine is expensive across Singapore). Attentive staff, good service, and a very pleasant dinner highlighted by outstanding food
5
The place is ensconced in the lush green surrounding at Dempsey Hill. Excellent service but the icing on TOP is the brunch menu.Loved the Szechuan Chilli chicken, with rice! The chicken & veggie dumplings were a close competitor to Din Tai Fung! If you're planning to sit outdoors with your friends for a relaxed Sunday brunch, recommend this place!

Dinner on Friday night. Great looking restaurant and location. Interesting menu and beer selection. BUT what spoils the restaurant is the obvious need for the management to try and extort money from customers with their corkage charge. Having lived in Singapore for 10 years we have become used to high alcohol prices when eating out and sometimes, not always, opt to take our own wine either due to a special occasion or just to try and keep the final bill down.Most of the fine dining establishments in the CBD charge S$40-45 corkage which is reasonable. However Chop Suey seems to want to alienate its patrons by charging S$75++. There is no justification for such a high charge and just goes to show the intention to have the customer pay their inflated prices for wines on the menu. They don't have any particularly notable wines and when I look at the sauvignon blanc at S$100 plus I realise I can buy the same retail online at S$23 inc so they are going for a 5 times mark up. PURE GREED!!!! A couple of examples of fine dining restaurants corkage charges - Oso charges S$45 or free on a one for one basis and Monti on Fullerton Bay just S$40. I would have given a higher rating but just don't like being extorted
3
Ambiance and quality of food all play a massive factor when it comes to the overall dining experience. I had been here once before and left a lasting impression on me. When I discovered my friend would be in town visiting, I made no hesitation to book Chopsuey to impress her. We were greeted with big smiles and accommodations were made to seat us at a preferred location. The waiter tending to us seemed jittery and on edge which can only lead me to believe he was either a newbee or feeling immense pressure on the floor. Food was phenomenal as expected, but then things quickly got weird. I had ordered a refill of water that I had idea was in a bottle, as I saw staff pouring Singapore's finest tap in a jug refilling tables. When a bottle of still was brought over, I had realized I had half a bottle still sitting on my table. I made it clear that I was okay and no longer needed it which brought much confusion to the waiter. 1 minute later, a lady dressed in black came over and threw some major attitude and stormed off when I told her to cancel the water. I get it. She popped the bottle, but we are not talking about sparkling here. For a packed house there is someone that is bound to order some still water. I also then asked her to please pack the food which she then returned pretty much threw on my table. Interesting. I bit my tongue as it would be uncouth of me to shame her in public in a packed house for her attitude, and didn't want to make a mountain off a mole hill. She also was at the register and didn't bother cancelling the bottle she added to my tab, which I had to request to amend on the bill. This isn't a reflection of the other staff who was very hospitable, but she definitely left a sour taste in both our dining experience

Just having arrived in Singapore and celebrating our wedding anniversary we were taken here for dinner. Told that it was the old barracks, we were surprised to find lush and beautiful vegetation outside the restaurant. We decided to sit outside admiring the view and imbibing our aperitifs whilst perusing the menu. All four of us decided on something different so settled for crispy duck Pow! Pockets, steamed Dim Sum Basket, Tamarind Lamb shank curry and crispy orange beef. We also included smokey sweet and sour Pork collar accompanied by stirfried crunchy leafy greens and mixed rice. All delicious. We finished with a salted Caramel Giant Profiterole and a bottle of Ayala Brut Majeur Champagne. It was a wonderful celebration with first class service from the staff - an ideal location for a special occasion
5
Read about restaurant in travel guide and meal was delicious! I had the soft shell crab version of chili crab...
Verdant setting only minutes from Orchard Rd. Attentive and low key service.
Highly recommended!
4
I took my mum and sister at the end of their Singapore visit and they loved it. Dempsey hill as a location is already kind of exciting after few days of major touristic visits.We had dumplings to share which is very cute presentation and tasty, and my sister managed to try laksa here (rather fancy one) so she was pleased.My mum wanted something more healthy so had wanton ramen.Chicken rice ball was interesting, later I knew this is actually traditional thing! We thought it's a creative dish from normal chicken rice
3
Wonderful setting and ambience - the building is very old world Singapore and a great place to bring visitors.That said, the menu relies heavily on deep fried food. We had: crispy shredded duck pancakes (deep fried), jade ocean trout (fried?), szechuan pepper chilli chicken, crispy orange beef (deep fried), salt and pepper beef ribs, stirfried crunchy leafy greens. Maybe our fault, or maybe the waiter could have suggested some less fried dishes. Bottom line, balance those 'crispy' or 'crunchy' or 'stir-fried' with some fresh dishes. The wine list was ok and the service seemed stretched on the night we were dining, although they were ok when we got their attention.I'm not racing back
4
Came here with family as they've been a number of times. Dempsey Hill which has a number of restaurants you can choose from. It is a lovely place - we sat outside overlooking the tree line with the city in the distance. All very civilised. Good beer selection; lovely wines - very, very good food. Warm and friendly service. Spicy Crab was delicious
5
The restaurant is in a very nice location. Friendly staff excellent asian dishes. Try the pork dish and noodle
5
Their dim sum was a treat, as were several other dishes my friend orderedfor us. She lives here and choose the restaurant. Demsey Hill has a park-like character as an old British barracks area. I got lucky, she ordered more dishes than needed so I also got dinner. :)
3
Used to be great but now the food and service is dropping off . Wine list not great either . Starters still excellent ie Lettuce leave
4
Nice decor and atmosphere. Food was good but unfortunately they messed up our order and we had to keep chasing for food, the appetizer came after everything else.
4
First time visit with half a dozen others whilst at a conference in Singapore.Chopsuey is an asian fusion restaurant so there are combinations of asian flavours and if you like that its fantastic.We ordered a whole raft of starters to share which is great so we ended up trying half a dozen different things, then a some substantial main courses followed by some heavy desserts.It has a cafe feel to it but we were in a sort of private room which was very quiet and had beautiful flowers / decorations that hep keep a light mood to a heavy technical conference.I'd come back here agai
5
We ordered 5 starters, 5 mains and 5 desserts among 5 people. I have to say all of the dishes were really good. The area is nice and you can choose to have outdoor seating which is fine on the evenings that are not hot.Worth trying especially if you have more than 2 persons
5
Loved the location, decor and food here. Indoor and outdoor seating. Beautiful location and the food was very tasty - especially the beef ribs
4
My husband and I felt like we had stepped back in time with the refurbished old soldiers barracks now an area of restaurants- Chopsuey is done beautifully and you feel like you are in a swank restaurant in the 30s/40s - great music and ambience. Food and cocktails are expensive but really delicious with unique flavours. Service was very slow and staff somewhat inexperienced with the menu. Salt and 5-pepper beef ribs was our favorite- amazing! And a delicious Singapore Sling.
5
The ambience rules here. With Jazz in the background, lush green all around the open area, friendly service and amazing Chinese food. The prices are high but worth it. My wife is vegetarian- the vegetarian dumplings are very nice as is hot and sour soup. As for non- vegetarians, the schezwan pepper chicken is delicious (you can get the tofu version as well). The cocktails are great too.
5
What an amazing restaurant ...Interiors and exteriors are in colonial-tropical style ..with a lot of attention to detail ..We had an outside table for 5, ..and what we experienced was simply outstanding ..A choice of creatively nuanced flavored Asian dishes, ..wholesome food, ...delightfulGreat attentive and friendly service, ...just watching how the staff coped with a very busy restaurant was impressive.Well done ...
5
This was my second visit to this restaurant albeit 2years apart and it did not disappoint. We had a large group and we shared a number of dishes, all of which came promptly whilst the waitress ensured to ask if we needed any additional dishes as we tucked into the food. The restaurant has a great atmosphere as it is out of the city and in a converted barracks building amongst some other restaurants, I would certainly recommend this restaurant to anyone visiting the cit
5
We were dining as two couples. Really enjoyed the night with perfect wine and delicious food. In dessert I recommend ginger pudding with vanilla ice cream
5
I have been to this establishment twice now and both times just for desert. Located on the chic and transit Dempsey Hill, Chopsuey is the sister restaurant to PS Cafe and shares the same quality food and setting. Staff are very friendly and attentive and happy to accommodate most requests - we wanted to share a desert. When visiting Dempsey I often try a Progressive meal approach to really absorb the full atmosphere of the place. Great food, stunning setting and fabulous service - ticks all the boxes for me!!
3
The food was fine...not really great for the most part...and the drinks somewhat different from the norm. A fairly good meal, perhaps a little bit higher than Singapore average pricing, but close to in-line. What really got us was the very rushed manner in which we were served. Clearly they wanted our order, for us to down the food within minutes of being served, and to get out so the table could be open to another party (I assume). Did not really enjoy it at all, and the average, if not just below average, service did not help. Too many other options around Singapore to return here
5
Every time I visit Singapore I insist on a visit to Chop Suey. The setting is beautiful...old colonial in vibe. This time we had the lettuce cups with spiced chicken and prawn to begin, some duck pockets and also duck pancakes. All beautiful. I was so pleased to find that Singapore soft shell crab was on the menu...last time it was out of season. Amazing and with a delicious sauce. Also amongst our party we had two huge portions of numbing pork ribs and a portion of beef short rib. The diners surprisingly cleared their plates and declared their choices as fantastic.someone had a healthyish option but to be honest....my crab and those ribs will live long in the memory. We'll be back next time I'm in town
5
i visited chopsuey for lunch a few years ago and was charmed but didn't make it back until now. we had dinner outside on a lovely evening. the food was as tasty as i remembered. even if it weren't i'd likely be a fan of chopsuey for the ambience. set at one end of the cluster of restaurants on dempsey hill it is open and airy and soothingly green outside. i liked the selection of spicy, garlicky sauces on each table and especially liked the dipping sauce that came with the edamame that we ordered as a starter. highlights of the meal were succulent prawns with tasty stuff (it was dark so wasn't sure what it wasâ€”tasted like flavorful minced meat) on top, pork and coconut salad (delish with bits of crispy pork skin but now i realize the coconut wasn't much in evidence), fried soft shell crab with fried bao and chili crab sauce. there are many dishes i'd like to go back and try so i'm happy to have chopsuey on my list of restaurants to return to
4
We had a family meal here. Something for everyone on the menu. Sat outside at the back. Lovely setting. Duck pancakes were great. On of the kids got some plastic in her float drink probably from the ice cream packaging. It was whisked away and replaced and it was taken off the bill. Great service.
4
Food was quite good & innovative. Just a little bit pricey. Nice atmosphere too. Place was crowded even after the regular peak hours.
4
After a wobbly start through no one being at the door to greet and seat us the service we received soon put that in the background. It was noted after taking our seat that the restaurant manager, who should have been focused on the front door, was giving a lot of attention to a table of diners inside. As mentioned on being seated the service was very good and the quality of meal was also very good. I thought the price was a little steep with my friends saying this is about the norm for Singapore. I enjoyed our dinner sitting outside under the awning (as it rained) at the marble top tables. As an aside Chopsuey Cafe is one of many on Dempsey Hill; an area that once housed the British Army
5
We read about this restaurant online and has mixed reviews .... we decided to try it tonight and we couldn't fault it !!! Excellent service and a very varied menu. It's a wonderful setting with a great feel to it .. we will definitely be going back
3
Food was good, though quite expensive for what we received. Service was good also. But they let us down on the basics - another restaurant with no wifi. Wifi is bars, cafes and restaurants is really now the ticket to play as people have choice - many in business would like wifi available. Make matters worse, they're another restaurant that doesn't take American Express - because of the fee. This is a lame excuse as most just factor it in or even pass it on to the customer. Quite the inconvenienc
4
When my wife wanted to go to Chop Suey over Gordon Ramsay's Bread Street Kitchen, I was skeptical. Chinese food over Gordo's??? "No problemo", since it was her birthday. I was soooo blown away by how hospitable and friendly our server was, her name is Rose. Bottle of wine, Grilled octopus for starters and Segway to the mains, Pork Chop, Assortment of Mushrooms, Soft Shell Chilly Crab & Longevity Noodles for good measure. Very pleased by the dishes, the wok's breath was very prominent in every dish. We will definitely make another visit soon. See you then Rose! You're one of the most pleasant and hospitable hosts ever. At the end of the meal, we were surprised with fortune cookies... a nice touch I must say. Word of advice, make your reservations as this place fills up pretty quickly
4
Chopsuey didn't disappoint. The prawn toasties were excellent. The dim sum basket was absolutely yummy. The food will never disappoint. It's a great place to have good cuisine but it was difficult to carry on a conversation. Something about the way it's structured makes the sounds echo!
3
Went in with high expectations as decor and ambiance are fab- modern black and white colonial upmarket feel to the place.Our starters were great albeit very basic cooking ingredients and spices. The major problem came with our main courses... do NOT order the roast chicken- it is dry and comes surrounded by dry prawn crackers! No thought has gone in to this dish and no jus to offset the dry chicken!Also do NOT recommend the crab tofu omelette- it's terrible! We managed to get the main courses free along with free coffee- we were so disappointed and next time when we go to Dempsey hill we will just nip to jones the grocer or if more upmarket Jill Thomson house
3
Mid-week dinner. Food is very well executed. Chic place in keeping with the PS brand. However main courses arrived (not all at once either) an hour after ordering. Waitress said it was because we ordered starters at the same time. So, folks, think carefully before ordering those starters.Water glasses ran dry, had to wave frantically for top-ups.Ten minutes after the bank alert that my card had been billed it still hadn't been returned to the table so I went to retrieve it from the cashier myself.Nobody said goodbye when we left, probably they were fed up with us asking for food, water and our bill. Won't be going back even though the food and ambience is good. If your service is off you can't charge these prices and expect people to leave happy
4
Chopsuey cafe is set in a great location, leaving the skyscrapers of Singapore long behind. With a distinctly colonial feel, the atmosphere is formal without being stuffy. The food is great if a little unadventurous, but really tasty and good quality. Would definitely recommend
3
It is another Chinese Restaurant. The only reason you would want to go is to try and dine in an old Military Medical Building converted into restaurants. The whole area, I was told was a Singaporean military base before. The architecture is lovely but the food is nothing to talk about
5
The Cafe is in the Dempsey area and is truly worth a visit. The menu was an asian take on American Asian food and it was delicious! We sat outside in the garden and enjoyed cocktails before diving into the appetizers which included the crispy duck pancakes and octopus. The most fun dish was the Gen. Tso's chicken, a take off from the American favorite " re-asainized " Service was excellent, attentive with out being obtrusive. Come for a relaxed dinner to get away from the bustle of Singapore
3
A little disappointed really as was looking forward to dinner here. Service not the best and the wait staff just don't seem to be really bothered... Needed to ask 3 different service staff to order and another 3 service staff for the bill. They seem to have horse blinders on and just conveniently look straight ahead... Food was otherwise ok. Some dishes quite good. Others very ordinary...
3
The quality of the food was not as bad as I had anticipated based on the name of the restaurant. The squid was probably the standout with the rest being ok. Cocktails were also done very nicely and the setting is gorgeous. Service wise although with a smile is always hurried - while slowly snacking and chatting over a drink, we were interrupted many times to ask if they could clear the table. It started to get a bit irritating. The bill wasn't cheap and to be expected but what was surprising was that they don't take Amex. For a restaurant to charge the prices they do, you would expect them to accept Amex. Although the food was nice, the overall feel was not very comfortable and not somewhere I would venture again
1
We arrived 20 minutes late (reservation at 11.30am, arrived at 11.50) to find that they had already given away our table without informing us. The attendant at the door was very rude and asked us if we had informed anyone we were planning to be late. When we replied that we thought someone from the restaurant would call us, she told us it was not her responsibility to inform us but rather the call center's responsibility. As we were waiting for the attendant to come up with a solution for us (we have 2 babies under 2 and changing restaurants is no easy task!), the attendant politely attended to other guests. The attendant (Filipino) was in my opinion racist (yes, I know this is a serious allegation), as she was very polite and smiley to the other Caucasian guests. After much discontent, she finally called the manager and managed to find us a table (it was then 12pm) that she said we needed to clear out of by 12.45 for a 1pm reservation. We thought rushed but doable, but when we reached the table, we found a dead cockroach on the chair (gross!!). We immediately called the attendant back who then called the manager. The manager gave a curt apology and swiped up the cockroach with a napkin. I really wished I had taken a picture!! Still we thought we would stay and have a quick lunch since our babies were growing increasingly impatient. We asked for our order to be taken and waited 10 minutes, then we went to the manager again to ask him to find someone to take our order and his reply was "I'm sure my staff will get to you soon." This was now 12.15pm. Mind you we had arrived to the restaurant at 11.50am. Anyone with screaming impatient babies can understand that an over 25 minute wait to be seated and for orders to be taken is simply impossible. But added to that the racist attendant, nonchalant manager, and the lack of hygiene, and you have a restaurant that we will never visit again.If Tripadvisor had negative stars, I would have rated it a negative star
5
Chopsuey has been consistently outstanding! We love their rendition of Asian favourites like Crispy Squid, Duck Pow, Numbing Ribs, Szechuan Chili Chicken and many others.Service is always friendly and unobtrusive. Rose and her team are Top Notch
5
We had dinner there, and the restaurant was buzzing. We were lucky to get a table outside, and it was a great experience. The food, modern Chinese, was excellent, the service was good and the ambience was great. Overall we all had a great time
3
Nice ambience and good service, although we had trouble with the waitresses English. Dim sum was nice. Probably didn't get the best of this restaurant, we'll go back and try again
5
Ate here with a work colleague and it was super. Delicious food and an extensive wine list Seafood, Asian, steak and moreReally rated it highl
4
Trying out new places in Dempsey hill and read reviews about this restaurant. Food are reasonably tasty. I won't be rushing back but not ruling out coming back to try some other dishes.Food is average, ambiance is nice. Ordered Crispy squid, Prawn, Orange Beef, fried rice and Lychee Granita. Love Crispy baby squid and prawn. Sambal Chilli on the side.OK : Granita and fried rice.Below average: Orange Bee
4
We didn't have a reservation but were easily seated. There were four of us and we ordered a selection of dim sum to share, as well as some delicious vegetable noodles. There was plenty to go round. Particularly liked the coke floats!
5
A great spot for brunch. Go here before the botanical gardens and have a wonderful lunch. We sat outdoors and are beautiful food whilst drinking coke floats!
5
My family booked this restaurant as a birthday surprise and I was so impressed with the whole experience. Shared a variety of plates between us, from the noodles to the duck pancakes to the schnitzel, and I cannot fault a single thing about them. Staff were wonderful. Only issue is with the bad selection of wine, and with the price of corkage only set to go up, proves somewhat of an issue. The interior and exterior is delightful, and love where the restaurant is situated, away from the city madness. Lovely place
4
Was brought here several nights ago and I was impressed by how they were able to convert the former barracks into a community of charming shops and restaurants in what is called Dempsey's - one of the gems I discover in Singapore no where near any MRTs. I reckon it's a tad challenging to come here without a car and I daw several taxi cans dropping off people around the area so I guess everyone has the opportunity to come. We were seated at the veranda as the main dining area was occupied and was waited on by very attentive and knowledgeable young men and women the whole evening. The place setting was impressive putting emphasis on both aesthetics and functionality. We had honey ginger chicken, beef noodles, steamed pork buns and surprisingly excellent coffee. Looking forward to coming back soon
5
This restaurant is 'out of town' but this is a very popular restaurant area. The evening was mild and we ate outside. Service excellent, and recommended dishes kept coming for our enjoyment. A delightful evening
5
A relative with frequent business visits to Singapore recommend this restaurant to us. Situated in a converted former British barracks, Chopsuey Cafe is now one of a number of eating establishments in this precinct.Food is Chinese but with a modern (western) twist. The crispy shredded orange beef was outstanding as was the honey chicken accompanied by a New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc. Staff are friendly and attentive. Ask them to order a cab to take you back to your hote
5
Had a wonderful tea-time at Chopsuey Cafe. The vibe was quaint and tasteful, loved the ambience with a glass house section to the restaurant. Service was extremely prompt and friendly. The local Asian inspired food menu was delectable and extremely tasty. We enjoyed the mud crab fried rice! Left the restaurant feeling refreshed and extremely satisfied
5
Great food and a beautiful setting. I have visited here a number of times with international guests and they all love it. The quiet garden and beautiful interior are just stunning. Food is delicious, absolutely recommend the crispy duck pockets and the san choy pau but everything is delicious. Request a table on the inside veranda for the perfect mix of indoor comfort and the outdoor view. Staff are friendly and service is good. Not a cheap place to eat but worth the price.
2
Having enjoyed dinner at the Dempsey branch a couple of times, expected a similar experience at the Martin Road branch. While the menu was the same, the quality and service were far from it.Service was slow with staff not knowing what they were serving, dishes and their respective sides not arriving together, and picking up water glasses by the lip for refills. All these things not an issue when eating at the local hawker center but when paying premium prices, its not acceptable
5
Just excellent! Service, choice of food and the quality and obviously the setting.For luch or dinner you will not be disappointed. When comparing the food in other places, I believe that in Chopsuey the standard of quality is high. Yes, you could argue that it is not exactly the local taste. May be a bit westernized? Well, overall you will not be disappointed
5
Have been here on numerous occasions. Really like the beautifull surroundings...set in lush green! Service is good, even for a big group they were attentative! Food is always good...because u do pay for it and its delicious and portions are big. Cake variety is so amazing...I order the toffee/banoffee one and also the super decadent chocolate cake -HUGE and need to share so rich! Like to order the quiche and the starter veggie bowl! P.S cafe never dissapoints
5
MIdweek lunch with 10 friends. Beautiful place and great asian menu options. Ordered the pad thai salad. $19 but a huge helping and so tasty fresh an delish. Grilled chick salad looked amazing! Tea served in cute pot with a fine cup and saucer!Will def fo back soon!
1
Very disappointing food - the hot n sour soup was basically soy sauce (thick) mixed with a few veggies. The other two dishes were okay but overall, we were not impressed at all. Coming from the same kitchen as PS Cafe our expectations were much more.
1
Decided to bring some friends to try out chopsuey on 6th May 2016, after enjoying the food on previous two occasions. Have decided not to ever visit or recommend Chopsuey to friends anymore. It's one of those establishments that have lost its humble beginnings and customer relationships. Poor management staff, uncooked food(chicken drumlets) and bad service standards. Never agai
3
We were in a large group of 14 people and whilst our non veg friends were delighted with the many meats and seafood they ordered, sadly as usual the veggie selection was disappointing . We veggies seem to get a raw deal everywhere. Guys please do you know we eat stuff other than Tofu?? Wish the veg menu was a bit creative or there were choice
5
Loved the food here every fish was delicious. Great selection of Asia fusion foods which won't disappoint. I'll Definitely go back highly recommend.
4
The starters were great - the tiny crispy baby octopus was just amazing - combination of crunchy and chewy, sweet and savory. One of the best starters I can remember from 50 years of fine dining. The main course was a special - chili soft shell crab, a tasty play on the iconic dish of the island. The crabs had a great crispy batter and the sauce was outstanding, but both overwhelmed the subtle taste of the crab. The main issue for me was just that it was too noisy for a conversation. I have hearing aids, but my dinner mates have perfect hearing and they said the same thing. The eating is great, the talking is not

Lovely place. Been there with the team in a private room setup (book in advance). You get to select a vegetarian or meat/sea good menu which includes starters, main and desserts. I've had the mix veggie with pork and beef as a starter, then their interpretation to Peking duck, and for main: vegetables, ribs, lamb and other dishes. All were very tasty, served beautifully and were accompanied by high level of service. The place looks great - an Asian touch with modern ambience, just like their food. Definitely going back

Tucked in a corner the ambience was charming colonial.The staff was friendly other than a China woman that needed to speak in Mandarin.Wide selection of cocktails: Mai Tai came with chilli. I had Veuve Clicquot Rose.Mud crab fried rice was flavoursome and just right. Spaghetti mee goreng was a good fusion attempt.The Szechuan pepper chilli chicken rivalled that of established Chinese restaurants.The orange vanilla magnum satisfied craving of chocoholics

Went here with friends. The setting was amazing and the food was excellent. What can I say, other than it was a truly memorable nigh

I visited the Martin Road Chop Suey Cafe. The restaurant is beautiful and attached to Ps cafe - Sister restaurants ! The ambience is lovely and romantic. Lots of greens ... The food was excellent! We tried the Halibut, Szechuan chicken, Prawns in Chili jam! Awesome Flavours. The mixed rice was excellent.The Ma po tofu was not good. Excellent place !

Chopsuey cafe is proposing an Asian influenced food in a very nice open environment, luminous and bright - very nice terrace that you can really enjoy since they had the good idea to add fans :)Portions are quite generous so think it twice before going for a 3 dishes mea

Slightly westernised Chinese food in a great venue. Really very enjoyable lunch venue and pretty good valu

The menu shows some good choices but taste wise pretty average Service was also average Atmosphere was good Prices were on the high side

I have been to this restaurant 3 times and the food has always been excellent. It is kind of a fusion of East and West food. The ambience is nice, service is very good. The food is a little pricey, but what you would expect to pay for this quality of food. Indoor and outdoor seating. Easy to park.

One restaurant I'm definitely visiting again and taking all my friends too! We sat outdoors and I loved the ambiance of this beautiful building. The music was perfect, the service great and the food was fantastic. I'd recommend the duck pancakes and a nice Coconut cooler to get the meal going. For mains we enjoyed the numbing pork ribs, honey chicken and schezwan chicken. The steamed banana pudding with ice cream was a perfect finish. It's a bit on the pricey side (app $300 for 2 couples including a bottle of wine) but well worth it as a treat

This Resto bar is in an old army camp and the dining area was designed within the barracks. Beautiful set up with a terrace where one can have after dinner coffee or drinks. The food was very good although the servings were quite small.
4
The restaurant space is a conserved black & white colonial-style house. We had cocktails in the cabanas al-fresco before enjoying dinner inside the air-conditioned restaurant. PS Cafe, owners of this restaurant, did a good job planning the interior; this lends an elegant yet warm ambience. The waitstaff is trained and friendly. We ordered about eight dishes that the four of us shared; the most flavourful was the succulent rack of lamb. Not inexpensive (about 240SGD for four people without wine) but overall, an enjoyable meal experience
5
Set in a restored beautiful colonial building on fashionable Dempsey Hill. The menu reads like a Chinese restaurant from the 80's but the food is very modern. Service is good and waiters provide good advice on selecting dishes. Some are hot so make sure you ask. Wine list is small but ok and a good selection of beer. There are daily specials so remember to check. Recommended for a group but it is on the noisy side
4
The food was refreshingly different Asian food with a happy twist!Unique flavors. I went with a friend and both of us had a great experience and we are definitely going to go back!The desert menu looked great, unfortunately we didn't tickle our sweet taste buds because the lunch was so good.Beautiful ambience... quaint with lush green outdoors.The service was not that great at all...it seemed they were understaffed with a packed restaurant....that to on a weekday afternoon. It also got very noisy....so not recommended for a business meeting
4
Nice restaurant in the famous Dempsey Hill area. Food was good, including desserts, in particular I would recommend Pavlova. The atmosphere was very pleasant and relaxing - we sat outside. The service was also quite good, can't complain.
5
It's always a struggle in Singapore to get a nice atmosphere, good food and good service in Singapore. Chinese is rarely my first choice but this knocked our socks off. The Sang Choi Bow (forgive spelling) was the best of the best. After we had one each we almost had to have a cage fight to see who got another. Dish after dish was top notch. The service was good which as many will know is a win in Singapore. The setting is very nice and I would advise to go for an outdoor table. Finally, we have no MSG hangover this morning.You have to go here
5
The cuisines on the menu are familiar items we see at zhichar stalls but the ingredients and taste are certainly above average! Will certainly be back there again!
4
We had no reservation but they still managed to give us a table for lunch on Saturday here, although the place was pretty packed already. Very friendly staff throughout the lunch. We started with a glas of bubbles and had a schnitzel and king prawns with vegetable noodles. Both were very good. We finished with cappucino's and the passion fruit cheesecake and warm bananacake with ice cream. Amazing, definitely something you should try. We heard this is owned by the same people from PS Café, always a good indication. Overall very good experience, the extensive menu was about the only "issue" as so many things looked so good on the menu, we had difficulties choosing! Very good place.
4
if you are visiting Singapore and want to have a taste of the old colonial experience then the area of Dempsey is perfect. Chopsuey Cafe at Dempsey is a delicious and stylish old school Asian experience. Book an outside table and enjoy the Asia fusion food served traditional style in the beautiful setting. If you don't drink alcohol then the price is very fair too

I've got to be a bit careful here, as Singapore is.....Singapore. They are fixated with food, and this the small street vendors and cafe's have some unusually good and robust food. Indeed there is one little place opposite Raffles that looks traditional Chinese/Malay and the prices are excellent but many tourists find these places a little scary and inaccessible; so places like Chopsuey Cafe are invented to cater for those with a surfeit of money and a taste for what appears to be posh.The road leading up to and around where Dempsey Hill is today was named after General Sir Miles Christopher Dempsey (1896–1969), a capable and highly regarded soldier who had a decorated military career. British forces occupied the hill in what was an Army Barracks during the war for the Brits, and later on, the local Military Forces. This Cafe, along with a parade of other restaurants now cater for folk who would like to escape Orchard Road in what is ironically a rather nice leafy enclave.The staff at Chopsuey all seem awfully young, with a lot of enthusiasm but little training. They really do need adult supervision; but the capability of wait staff in Singapore is decreasing and this place is no exception. I don't mean to be harsh but when I pay over $100 (Singapore) per person for a fairly modest meal, no starters and no dessert, I like to be treated well, yes? The food itself is excellent, and I really enjoyed the four or five dishes we sampled. The standard trick for all posh restaurants is to be miserly with the rice-dudes it's rice. White rice. Dude.My Mojito was rubbish; but I would not make anyone stand to attention in the sun over that, but you should know, right ?The wine prices are stupid all over Singapore pretty much and this place is no exception, but it still irks me. I propose a war against wine prices; with all restaurants having a house red and a house white that is good-just good. Own label, yes ? Sure, then we can pay for the top shelf wine. Tempt us maybe with a good description please.The food again is excellent, keep it up. The decor is lovely. The view over the gardens is lovely. I wont be going back, but that should not stop you as there is nothing essentially amiss with the place
5
Been here a number of times and can highly recommend this restaurant for the quality of the food, level of service and great colonial style building along with great outdoor seating. Try the crispy duck pockets, prawn toasties and red emperor fish
1
Great food but terrible service. Great atmosphere and the food was good but if you can bear bad service and cold food at times and starters coming at the end, then your ok!After complaining on one part of our food coming with out the other ( vegetables came 10 min before the rice and noodles), the waiter said "we don't control how they cook in the kitchen" and seemed angry and upset at us!But super foo

Nice athmosfere, good food. You just go there for eating, you cannot walk around. In that area there are only restaurants
5
Excellent food and service. Try the duck, seafood or just xiaolong bao. The hot and sour soup to accompany it and later move onto rice or noodles.Service is excellent and attentive.Please book, else you may be left waiting too long

Hubby and I booked in here for lunch after I read a review in the QANTAS magazine. It is situated up at Dempsey Hill so also allow time for a wander around checking out the other restaurants and shops. We had a lovely lunch, the food was beautifully cooked and delicious. The stand out dish was actually the Ginger Creme Brûlée which was amazing. You can sit inside or outside. Our only criticism was the English Xpat couple who allowed their 3 children to run around amoungst the tables giving no thought to other diners or the staff carrying food and drinks AND the staff who were too scared to say anything. This was left up to me. If I want to have my lunch around running children I'll pack a $2 sandwich and head to the nearest playground. Be warned this is a pricey restaurant once service tax and gst are applied. I would however recommend it and not having any alcohol will keep the price down
2
We had read great reviews on TripAdvisor about this restaurant but our lunch visit was very disappointing. Ambience was great and food was decent. Service was abysmal. The server who took our order was disinterested and had no suggestions. We ordered fries for our daughter, he said he would be able to serve wedges instead and we agreed. Instead he served a dish off the menu which included fries with edamame and some sauce. When we brought it to the attention of a senior appearing server named Simon, he rudely said he would simply cancel the order. No apologies or explanations. Eventually we called him back and requested him to serve us plain fries. Overall it was very challenging to get the attention of any server even though ours was a central table. Needless to say we will not be back again not can we recommend this restaurant to anyone.
4
we went there for dinner with friends...has a nice veranda where we sat....food is awesome....house wine is what we had and was quite nice....it is a good place with nice service (though slightly slow) and we were not complaining...quiet place and one table doesnt get into the conversation of the other...
5
We celebrated my partners birthday during lunch this month and enjoyed the food very much. Great outdoor setting, which was perfect for the occasion. It was a pity that they did not do anything for her birthday even though I had asked for it during the time I made a reservation via their online reservation system
4
The decorations was very pleasant and nice both indoor and outdoor. The menu had variety of selections to suite your preferences and well presented. In general the food taste almost the same except the spicies sauces that make a lot different. It is worth trying the yellow chile sauces. The duck entrée is a must try. The restaurant has no private room; if there is a private party, you will hear a lot of noise and may disturb you if need to have business discussion
5
A meal for 6 covers sharing. This clean stylised restaurant has an extensive menu and I'd recommend you read it before you arrive.Atmosphere was lovely and great to converse in. Background noise was about the best I've experienced in Singapore. Lots of traditional dishes tweaked dynamically tastefully and respectfully. Portions are small and this is the first time I've left a great restaurant hungry. But that was more to do with suiting all diets thus redusing the range of choice of dishes. All excellent. Their signature rice is divine and I'd say pretty unique in my experience. It was refreshing ( a mid week visit ) to be able to get really engrossed in coversation and the food . I will return with more friends. I'm banking on chopsuey cafe being consistent enough to host any guests in the future to the same standards.
1
I read the nice reviews on Tripadvisor and thought I would give this restaurant a try. Ambience was very good and service was decent. But the food was highly disappointing for the price we paid. Our company of three ordered the dim-sum starters, a crispy fried noodle which were average, a vegetable dish which was way overcooked, and most disappointing of all, the chicken in shaoxing wine, a bland, unappetizing and visually non-appealing dish. We will not come back to this place for food (it does not do justice to our wallets), maybe a cup of coffee just to enjoy the ambience
5
I visited Chopsuey Cafe for dinner, it was slightly further than I expected but well worth the trip. The atmosphere decor and styling of the place is brilliant, it has a great colonial style to it.The staff were polite and attentive and the food was delicious. As it's slightly out of the way it doen't get too touristy which is good
5
We were here for late lunch and stayed on for over 2hrs sipping drinks and savouring starters and lunch. The layout and seating at the restaurant are varied...veranda, inside n outside. All of them are in the midst of tall trees and captivating greenery all around. We ordered lettuce chicken wraps which were DIY which I found endearing. The sauce was truly its essence...forgot to ask chef for the ingredients. We ordered Tingling Chilli Jam Prawns n Smoked Fish Fried Rice...great experiment with food. Loved the drinks...Lytchee Chilli Margarita n Kafir Lime, Vodka muddled drink called Bee Sting. They were awesome. Highly recommended. The service had to repeatedly asked for..the only downside of this fabulous place -:( Must book a table in advanc
4
We've been here a few times and the service has definitely improved. Previously the staff sere a little rude and rushed but the service has improved dramatically.A great location and selection of food and wines. I would definitely recommend Chopsuey for a casual night out
5
The recreation of old familiar favourites is interesting. Not overly non recognisable as with some fusion food.The lamb shank was braised to perfection with the meat falling of the bone easily.The stir fried greens can do with more "wok hei"Service was prompt and staff attentiveOverall an enjoyable dining experienc
4
Nice selection of Asian and Western favourites with some fusion dishes. Numbing pork ribs, sweet and sour chips, organic tofu, mud crab fried rice and duck pow pockets were great. The steamed banana pudding is an amazing dessert and must be tried. The coolers were great esp sitting outdoors on a lazy Sunday afternoon.
5
Having seen that some of the recent reviews of this establishment were less than complimentary, we approached our night there with just a little trepidation. There was absolutely no need whatsoever. A terrific 'buzzy' atmosphere was further complimented by the very efficient staff. Despite having not pre-booked on a busy night, front of house still calmly ushered us to an ideal table within seconds of our arrival. The menu is really extensive and it's always worth paying attention to the specials board. I think this is one of those eateries though, whereby you could literally order anything off the menu and not be disappointed. Everything we ate was truly delicious having been beautifully cooked and presented. Singapore is very expensive generally, but we felt that having had more than enough to eat and also having consumed more that enough prosecco and red wine £108.42 for 2 people (inc tax and service) represented good value for money. This place has great ambience - it's more than worth a visit
4
After over 20 years living in Asia, it made me smile when Chopsuey Cafe was described to me by a friend as real British Chinese food. The beef in orange sauce and the sweet and sour pork certainly did remind me of UK but I can't recall it tasting so good. The duck pockets as a starter are delicious. Service is pretty good, as is the ambience. Wine is generally new world so could probably do with a little more old world too, as some will pair nicely. Definitely worth a visit. My two guests from the UK certainly enjoyed it
5
My wife & I ate lunch at Chopsuey cafe, we loved the butefuialy designed colonial style building, we planned to eat starters & a main, after sharing the starters we could not eat another thing. The food was amazing bursting with flavour the portions were very large but no complaint here. If you eat here try one of their Chineses inflanced cocktails very nice. Recomend prawn dumpling
3
We found Chopsuey to be charming in regards to its colonial style building, its deco and its green surroundings. We took an overseas guest and she was happy with the novelty of it.When it comes to food though, we found it just ok. Good quality but nothing exceptional for the prices charged. I will probably visit Chopsuey again to give it another go, hopefully the food will justify the prices next time
4
Enjoyed a good brunch here with friends on a Sunday. Service was generally good although took time for a server to initially come over. Menu was good with some interesting western/Asian brunch fusion. Was overall good and a nice change but was not wowed by the food. The setting is great however with lush tropical views and outdoors fans to make it pleasant to eat outside.
4
My friend picked this place and I went along with her idea. I knew that this place serves fusion Cantonese. I admitted I was sceptical how great can fusion food be. The menu had some "authentic" Cantonese dim sum such as prawn dumplings(har low) and the Chop suey's version of crispy noodles with scallops is good. The rice roll was a little strange to me. It did had some garnishing on top . Not too bad but was not what rice rolls should be. I understand that Chop Suey café is trying to bridge the gap between Cantonese and Western but perhaps having it done more Cantonese and adding some items that cater to westerners' palate could work better , rather than fushion. Overall the décor was lovely. Good for dinner, business,lunch and couples on date
3
We booked for a Sunday evening dinner to try this place out, as I wanted to find a place that would be a good Asian fusion type place to take guests to from other countries.Not too busy for a Sunday evening. We ordered 1 entree to share and then 2 main courses with some vegetables. Our entree was by far the best dish San Choi Pau. One of our mains was a Sichuan tingling prawn dish well we had to ask if there was even any Sichuan in the dish as it just didn't have that Sichuan tingling sensation. The waitress assured us it did. I ordered one of their signature cocktails which was a mandarin margherita which was quite icy and just did nothing for me!So overall, quite disappointing - certainly not good enough to go back to or take international guests to.Service was ok for a quiet night - have seen other reviews that state the service is bad but it seemed ok for us
4
The food was actually pretty great. The quality of the food was outstanding and everything was made and served really well. The service though, was pretty bad. We had to wait so long for our food and they served everything together instead of a starter first and then a main course. The food was also pretty over priced and honestly, the food wasn't worth that much. It was also extremely rushed so I wouldn't surest going there for lunch. It's a perfect location and environment for brunch or dinner. You can go with little kids but be prepared to wait.
5
The red emperor fish was delicious. Get a few entrees to try lots of great flavors. Beers we cold and great service.
5
This is one of our favorite breakfast spots in Singapore. Great service, amazing food and a great relaxed environment

What an amazing restaurant
The food
The menu
The sit out area
The decor
The service
The entire experience is just amazing
I highly recommend this restaurant
We had the dim sum which was incredible
A must do
5
Great taste and amazing sit-out option. I loved multiple variety of food offered with a cheerful smile. The sit-out option gets acquired much faster than the air conditioned restaurant.
If you are a non vegetarian foodie, this is a must visit.
4
Dress cool and enjoy the lush green surroundings of the outdoor tables. Except for the humidity, the setting is quite perfect - A colonial building with wide windows and a verdant garden. Mud crab fried rice, tingling chilli jam prawns, crispy seafood noodles and Szechuan string beans were delicious. However my favourites were hainanese pork chop and chips, organic silk tofu and the numbing pork ribs. I found the taste of the honey ginger chicken to be overpowered by the ginger. The iced roselle tea was very refreshing. Service was prompt and efficient though somewhat unsmiling. Make a reservation. It gets quite crowded.
4
On a relatively cooler day, the outside is great but the indoors also gives you a good open feel - and is much cooler! The food was really good - similar to the Martin Road experience - but the ambience here was nicer than Martin Road which is probably more formal
2
I had an Italian guest in town and took the opportunity to give Chopsuey a try for their fusion Chinese menu. We had the indoor seating for dinner and the my first impression was of the noise. It was really a very loud din, totally unsuited to this kind of restaurant. I had to almost shout throughout our conversation. Thinking back, I've never before experienced this level of noise in a restaurant, not even in a McDonald's!Honestly the dishes were below my expectations. At this price and with their reputation I had expected better, more interesting takes on our usual Chinese dishes. We did ask for recommendations and had the Crispy Duck Pow Pow Pockets, Szechuan Pepper Chilli Chicken, Long Life Vegetarian Noodle and Chopsuey Chopsuey. Besides the Duck Pockets, the other dishes were not that much different from the regular stuff found in your average Chinese restaurant.So overall we were paying double (maybe triple) what we can find similarly in other restaurants. And it was too noisy to have a normal conversation. My Italian guest said he liked the food, but I think the locals would know better. ;-
3
A beauty restaurant with a great ambience. The interior of the restaurant is warm and cosy. Perfect to relax and have meals with families and friends. The outdoor Al Fresco dining is set on a deck under big trees, which makes it very lovely too.The food is Chinese with a twist. Do expect fusion Chinese, rather than traditional Chinese styled dishes. Some of the dishes are a bit too salty or too sweet and they become overpowering to the palette. However, the presentation is good and high quality ingredient are being used. The meat and vegetables are well cooked. The serving is rather big too, so do not order too many dishes
5
While visiting Singapore on vacation our friend who lives there took us to Chopsuey. What a jewel. We were late for our reservation because the streets around our hotel were closed as the people were practicing for their 50 year celebration. No problem, our table was held for us. Our friend ordered a variety of appetizers and 2 main courses. Everything was delish. The duck was good as was the chicken. The service was perfect, and even though we were late, we were not rushed. In city with fantastic food, Chopsuey stands with the best
5
Nica and refine food, has all the de flavor an portion for one person, its a bit expensive but the atmosphere is very nice, white old British home.Careful if you don't eat spice hot food, enjoy the honey ginger chicken, the duck dishes, its worth to visit
5
We had the San choy bai which was amazing!!! Totally recommend. The prawn and scallop dumplings were really good too. I had a mandarin cocktail that was really delicious. Our waiter was Maverick and he was efficient, well mannered and informative.
Totally recommend.
4
Chopsuey is one my favourites restaurants in Singapore at the moment. Nothing better than sitting on the outside terrace with friends eating great food and in a very relaxing atmosphere. Service is very good.
4
We had dinner there on the terrace. Great atmosphere great food and service and cery enjoyable evening. Price are fair. We enjoyed the smiming area for a night cap. A good place for an evening out.
4
The cocktails were seriously great, so was the dessert but the vegetarian food was too hot and spicy.. overall experience was good although found the service a little slow.
5
Had dinner late. Martin St. Location but entrace is a bit confusing. Enter through Chop Suey Petite which has a different menu. Food and service were excellent. Duck pockets were of especial note. Orange beef was excellent, but string beans with chicken was just good. Drinks were fairly priced for Singapore. Definitely worth a visit
4
Have greatly enjoyed this restaurant for the good and consistent quality of food. I visit it with my family and despite there being no kids menu, kids are able to have a good meal. The ambience is also quite good.Only complaint is that the restaurant is pricey and that discourages visits more often.Highly recommended if you have not been there. One of my favourite restaurants in SIngapore
4
Went here for Sunday lunch. Beautiful restaurant with wonderful food. We ended up seated in a conservatory area not inside but not outside. Ordered a number of items from there dim sum menu. Food was awesome, the cod and pumpkin and the deep fried beancurd with cray fish was particularly good. Service at times was a little slow but generally a great way to spend a long lunch on a Sunday
5
When we walked through the door we were greeted by the fragrance of a huge bunch of fresh lillies! The ambience here is lovely, it feels like you've stepped back in time.The food is very different from most you find in singapore, the sesame prawn toast, sweet and sour pork, and steamed ginger pudding were amazing! I can't wait to go back and try some of the other dishes.Service was efficient and friendly, we will definitely visit again
5
Met a lady in Raffles who suggested this place to eat. Took a taxi as there is no MRT nearby. It is an old army barracks now converted into restaurants. This is in Block 10 (at the end). We were warmly welcomed and given the choice to eat inside or out. The menu was very interesting, a kind of fusion/Asian menu. We asked for a starter but the waiter said we should try a particular dish, San Choy Pau. We decided to give it a go and we were so glad we did. It was one of the nicest starters we have ever had and I ended up asking for the recipe! All the food was delicious, if you have a pudding share it as they are HUGE!! The service was excellent and the whole atmosphere lovely. If we go back to Singapore I shall go there on the first night so I could probably go again, thank you for such a memorable evening at Chopsuey
3
The appetizers and mains are a bit of a let down if one is looking for authentic chinese food. The vegetarian dumplings are probably the best of the lot. I tried the Pork chops and found it very sweet along with the the lettuce with veggies which was super spicy. Must try cocktails - Opium brew for all the laphroig lovers and Chopsuey Mai Tai - fantastic balance of flavours not too coconutty which you would expect it to be. Chilli dark chocolate cake was probably the best chocolate cake that I have had in a very long time. It had hints of cinnamon and chilli which were not overpowering but just about right! It is definitely a place worth visiting for drinks and desserts. I was very disappointed with the service. There was nobody attending to our table and there were a few times we had to physically get out of our chairs to get their attention. I would really hope for this to improve for my next visit
4
Our second visit this time taking some close friends visiting Singapore. Good food very tasty, clean delicious wonderful flavours. Lovely environment overlooking lush gardens in tropical Dempsey.
4
Nice location, nicely decorated with first class service and very good food. They serve a broad range of dishes and can be recommended both for luncheons and diner parties.
Relatively expensive, bust so is everything in Singapore!
3
A good 'district' for many restaurants, this one doesn't live up to the hype. All the dishes were very sweet and very anglo rather than Chinese. Better and more authentic elsewhere at a fraction of the price.
5
I think some of the reviews here saying the food isn't authentic etc have missed the point of this place. From the minute you walk into the white colonial space, with large windows looking out onto the lush tropical gardens and the sounds of 30s jazz floating through the air - it's clear this place is riffing on the British colonial era. The food is a twist on Anglicised Chinese food- but it's done so well. From the Opium Brew cocktail which is served in a small clay jug on ice and when opened, literally releases an evocative cloud of lavender and violet smoke. The food is clever. The crispy duck pow! pockets filled with shredded duck confit & pulled roasted duck in soft white buns took me immediately back to Beijing. Not authentic Peking Duck - but far more than a mere nod to it. We asked the waiter to suggest two mains which would have the balance of flavours requisite for chinese share dining. He recommended the Numbing Pork ribs - with chilli and sichuan pepper coating plus the sweet orange beef. ZOMG - such melty ribs and such crispy sweet beef. Rounded out with green papaya salad and some stir fry greens - the serves are really generous. Speaking of generous - the chilli chocolate cake for dessert could feed 3 or 4. You have been warned. Service was friendly and efficient without being obtrusive. Finally, the prices are higher than a hawker centre, naturally- but not nearly as high as an equivalent meal in Melbourne. I was pleasantly surprised at the bill. Have a post prandial wander around Dempsey Hill. You are in the middle of the British Army Barracks from the height of the colonial era. Now you get it, right
5
When I opened the door and see the room in white with colonial style furniture and some big leaves to give the place feel more cosy, it was a good start. Menu selection is different from typical Chinese restaurant. A menu with good twist but not fusion. Food was awesome and service was equally good and efficient. Highly recommended for anyone who wants to try something different in great setting
5
We were invited to join local Singaporean friends at Chopsuey Café on a recent visit to Singapore. This restaurant and others at Dempsey Hill are a well kept local secret. The atmosphere is great the food is a wonderful fusion of many cultures and the staff are extremely friendly and accommodating.We arrived early from downtown, not knowing what the unpredictable Singapore traffic would be like. We have Christmas presents for our friends and the staff were extremely accommodating in looking after them while we looked around the extensive old complex.While waiting for our friends to arrive my wife and I enjoyed fantastic cocktails. Mine was extremely interesting, it was called opium brew and arrived in a stone jar with the cup as a lid. When the cup was removed smoke that had been infused in the alcohol slowly escaped. Mind you it's not a drink for the faint hearted.Yes it was expensive but it was a dinning experience not just a meal
2
The ambience was wonderful, the staff were superb; only problem was the food that didn't match up.While I get the novelty and potential behind the Anglo-Chinese concept, I felt it wasn't executed well. The food didn't taste any better than any American Chinese food (think sweet processed sauce ridden dishes). If the goal was to recreate horrible 'Chinese' take-out reminiscient for exchange/overseas students, then Chopsuey definitely got it right. If the goal was to present these Anglo-Chinese food with the quality that defines Singapore cuisine, Chopsuey missed the mark.We tried the pumpkin & cod dumplings, crispy duck pow! pockets, tingling chilli jam prawns and the bully beef pie. Only the prawn dish was deserving of a mention. And for the price tag I'm not sure it was exactly worth it.

I'd been to the Chopsuey Cafe at Martin Road which was nice and unique but not super. The cafe at Dempsey is much better. Being in an old building with seating both inside and outside and with a higher roof meant that the restaurant felt more open. We went with a larger group so we had more food choices. Finally the food was actually better. Unfortunately the wine list is short. Otherwise a good night.
3
I liked the ambience and service we received, but found it a little expensive by the time you add on 17% taxes, and high cost for beers and a cocktail ($19).Food was a good fusion of Asian cuisines and western style cooking.It was easy to talk, as the music was not too loud.Bathrooms were very clean.Easy to find and not difficult to get a taxi from that location

Chop Suey was the first restaurant we visited in Singapore. Situated in the very cool area of Dempsey Hill, the restaurant’s location, setting and design is beautiful. Sitting outside in the garden area with crooner music playing in the background, I felt like I was being transported back to 1950’s Paris. However, the food was anything but old; fresh, tasty, Chinese food. We opted for a number of starters and, rather than doing the usual (ordering too many starters and mains all at once, thus totally over-facing ourselves), we opted to put off ordering the mains until we’d eaten our first course. This was a great shout as it resulted in us ordering just two mains afterwards (between 4 of us). Lots to recommend from the ribs to the buns, the rice to the salad cups; the food was wonderful. Wine was pretty reasonably priced (as was the food). Service was pleasant enough, just not attentive, with the exception of a young girl who was obviously a trainee. The staff could learn a lot from her approach. I’d definitely return to Chop Suey for a romantic meal or for a relaxed dinner with friends

Food was great.Service was Great. The interior design was of a very high standard. Very pleasant to be able to sit outside - no view though.

The food was kind of average, the prices were mid range. The service was excellent and the restaurant it's self is lovely and stylish. Just don't get stuck here if it rains as getting a taxi is nearly impossible.

Restaurant offers a large variety of Asian dishes with a creative twist . Quality is excellent. Service is good. Very elegant modern settings, and a nice terrace opening up on the jungle ( small jungle !)

Set in the old colonial barracks part of the Dempsey Hill complex of restaurants, bars and antique shops this is well worth the visit. The setting both indoors and out is stylish and relaxed with a nod to the colonial history, it's laid back vibe and period music makes this perfect for a laid back dinner. If sitting outdoors take the basic mosquito preparations, albeit we had no issues on this visit. The Chinese inspired food was exceptional, we enjoyed sharing starters and mains between our group of 4, everything was equally strong so no particular recommendations however if pushed I'd go with the DIY Lettuce Cups starter and the Rusty Nails main (beef strips in a sticky orange sauce). We had drinks first, champagne for the ladies, beer and the Opium Brew (laphroig whiskey & absinthe cocktail) for the boys, before ordering starters and then only ordering the mains having consumed the starters giving us time to assess how hungry we were and allowing the evening to roll on slowly. We ordered 4 starters and then 3 mains plus a rice dish, which is a valuable base for the mains. That was comfortably enough food for 4. With service being pleasant but slow at times, as is common in SG, the drinks and dinner took 2.5 hours and having booked in advance there was no rush to move us off our table. With a very nice Shiraz (The Guilty) which we cooled to retain its freshness the bill came to approx SGD 110 (GBP 55) per person. An excellent evening for us visitors and our friends who live locally

The look of this restaurant is lovely, definitely a place to dress up for a special occasion.Food on the whole was excellent with a couple of dishes just not to our taste. Service was mixed, our waitress took plates away when we were still eating and was a little surly, however everyone else was professional and friendly.Would certainly recommend this restaurant but at the price you pay would like to see some improvement
5
I have visited this restaurant or two times now this months, both times entertaining overseas visitors. all in all its just simply fun and the menu is varied with fusion of asian and western food , which worked very well for me and my guests.I wish to highlight the service received by waiter called maverick (hope I got the name right), who simply was amazing. knowing the menu well (even the wine list) was just one of the great attributes of this particular staff. one might think this is the norm, trust me it isn't. the difference between a 'plate carrier' and a skilled waiter is huge.try Chopsuey and am sure you won't be disappointed. amazing fried rice with. just to name on

Went last night for dinner. Environment is top notch. But unfortunately the food was not up to scratch. The standards was particularly disappointing in light of the excellent environment that the restaurant provided. The concept somehow was an unfortunate clash between Asian hawker Centre comfort food with a western upper class twist which was just too confusing. I think it would appeal to westerners who don't have an understanding of what's hawker food is. But for locals, the alternative is just so much more superior. Which makes the exorbitant price even more unpalatable. For my experience, dunno what happened but there was a delay in the food service which somehow apparently they conveniently forgotten until reminded

A lovely decorated place where you'll feel right at home. Great atmosphere. Staff is friendly, helpful and have great knowledge of what they're serving. Just the way we like it. And than the foodâ€¦ VERY good. We sat outside and had some lovely dishes. The fried rice with smoked fish is to die for. As is the steamed banana pudding for dessert. Okay, it is a bit pricey. Spent $200 for two persons. If you're not a high roller like us it still is a lot of money but we thought it was worth it. So would definitely recommend the place and will certainly go again
5
We arrived late on Sunday night after calling ahead to make sure they were open. We had 15 minutes to order and asked for recommendations, I was pleasantly surprised by the waiters knowledge of the menu and excellent recommendations. We had over ordered and our waiter suggest dropping one dish, which was perfect advice because we were full after the meal.The sangria cocktail with baby roses is to die for and matched perfectly with the food.The price was very cheap for the service and quality of food. The atmosphere was amazing and the restaurant was perfect for a date. Would definitely recommend this to anyone. I look forward to trying more PS Cafe venues

I had a delightful Sunday lunch here with my family. Each dish we ordered was great as were the desserts. The ambience was very pleasant as well - both indoors and out doors. Overall a fantastic experience.Bill was around 208 S$ for 3 adults and 2 young kids without alcohol but with desserts. So the experience did come at a price ......but overall we did enjoy it.A must visit place....just don't go wild with the ordering to avoid an unpalatable bill at the end. I enjoy reviewing restaurants and Hotels so that others may benefit from my experiences as I benefit from theirs. Hope you found this helpful

Lovely restaurant in an old black and White building. Very relaxed vibe and fantastic food. Great cocktails and the most amazing desserts.....make sure you leave room!
5
Great fresh food. Served in a fantastic setting. Sit out side is a must. Great friendly service. If looking for a good nite out with friends type of place with lots of share food then this is the place.
5
We were recommended this restaurant by a friend living in Singapore and are very happy to pass on the recommendation.The setting is beautiful, old colonial, great background music & excellent food, as we have discovered in Singapore wine is expensive but other to that was great value.Dempsey Hill in General is a nice place to visit with lots of restaurants
3
Beautiful colonial setting. Some food was really good, some just ok. We started with some dim sum and then shared some main dishes. I thought the dim sum was better, but given that you are in Singapore I think you pay more than you would elsewhere because you are in Dempsey. Service was ok, but not memorable. I would go back and try some of the brunch menu next time
5
This restaurant was book by our business friends living in Singapore. The area is filled with restaurants and very popular with expats. The Chopsey Cafe has a colonial feel over it and the speakers were playing nice jazz music from the 30-40s. We ordered 5-6 different dishes to share. Everything from dim sum to black pepper chicken and lamb stew. It all tasted heavenly. Among the best meals I've had actually.
3
We dined here as guests of an expatriate resident. The setting is outstanding - genuine old colonial. Service was mixed; food was OK but lacked authenticity, bearing in mind the Chinese implications of the name. As a guest, I have no idea of the prices. Would I go there again - that is seek it out? I'm rather unsure. There is a lot of competition in Singapore
3
As Americans, it was so odd to be with local Singapore friends at a restaurant that touts its foods as "American style Chinese".... who knew that fortune cookies are only in America?we had lots of different dishes... fried rice (terrific), green beans with minced chicken (excellent), vegetable and scallop dim sum (so-so), crispy calamari (boring and a bit heavy). My friends said the French toast and omelets were very good. Chilli chocolate cake and banana cake were very good, but the ginger cake was only so-so.For a party of 10, I thought the service was inadequate - we kept having to go find the waiter to ask for water and to take orders.This is a new restaurant and while the food is good... they really need to work on the service
5
Have been to ChopSuey a few times and this time with a large group. Food was great (again) and all enjoyed themselves. Service is friendly, wine list is good. We had a table on the terrace so we did not distrub other diners and was perfect. Not cheap, but great for a treat. Will be back

I visited Chopsuey Cafe at Martin Road on its second day of opening on a Saturday for dinner. The restaurant was about a third full.The food here is geared towards westerners and the crowd was half Chinese/half non Chinese - I suspect some people who like more authentic Chinese food may not like it. It may be a good fun option when taking out out of town guests. However I would not take guests our here who like more traditional food. The food is no worse than what I would get in many Chinese restaurants in Australia just a bit more hip. The dish sizes however aren't large in size so can be expensive compared to many other Chinese food options in Singapore. They seem to have a long drinks menu.The service staff were attentive and helpful. Bookings can be easily made online which is useful
4
I have to admit, the way the staff welcomed me, sat us and attended to us left a lot to be desired. So this should have been a worse review. But, the food was great ... so that makes up for the shotty staff. The atmosphere was nice too, with nice outdoor seating and such. I look forward to going back, not for service, but to try more dishes !
3
The name is misleading. This is a restaurant not a cafe. It's serves American Chinese type of food.
The place is nice but food and drinks overpriced.
3
You come to this restaurant for the beautiful garden setting and desserts. The food itself is very average and the portion sizes are small and the bill quiet large.
4
this is a great restaurant for a more casual night out, laid back atmosphere and a great selection of fusion food. It is not high end dining but great for catching up with friends and relaxing without being stuffy...exactly as it should be. Like the rest of Singapore it will not be a cheap eat but nor should it be. The ingredients are fresh and tasty and thoughtfully presented. This is our go to restaurant when friends are in town and we are never disappointed. Give it a tr

This is a lovely restaurant in a garden setting. The menu had a lot of really interesting choices from meat, seafood and vegetarian options. We shared some rice paper rolls and dumplings for entree which were full of flavour and taste. We shared a deep fried fish with one of the loveliest dipping sauces I have tried. The restaurant seemed understaffed and we waited at the end of our dinner for too long for the table to be cleared. We waited for ages for a dessert menu which never came so my husband went and got one. We thought that would hurry proceedings but they just took too long to come and take a dessert order that we decided to let it go and headed home. With a couple more staff members this could easily be a 5 star cafe but the service lets them down. This is a shame because I found the food really wonderful
4
A lovely outside round table is an optimum position thanks to our knowledgeable Singaporean hosts. The food was really quite excellent - a wide variety of textures and tastes. You must try the crispy beef with orange and the prawns. Service, as noted by others was middling to poor. The cocktails we ordered had to be chased and arrived after the first course and after the wine. They need a matriarchal maitre d' to quietly muster the serving troops (this is in an old military barracks after all) and make things happen. A small change would make a big difference.Aside from that a really good evening out. Love to go again when they have sorted out the service
4
Enjoyable Chinese food in a house like setting with outside seating chosen by our nephew and his wife who live locally. Interesting restaurant area with plenty of choices. The only problem was the noise level. It was very difficult to have a conversation but a very good meal nonetheles

I tried to book this restaurant earlier this week via the hotel concierge. We booked a table for 20.45 hrs. and at 20.00 hrs. when we left the hotel, the concierge told us that the table is no more available... the restaurant did not keep the table, as the dinner reservation was not confirmed. Now how do you confirm a restaurant table?!Further to that, when making the reservation we were asked to either join the first seating, as of 18.30 hrs. as on the second seating, starting from 20.30 hrs. no space would be available. This is a restaurant on land, why would you have two seating / meal periods? Feels a bit like being back in boarding school. Honestly I do not understand that, why you simply cannot book a time at your preferred time. A few days later, we were in the area of the restaurant, and we walked up to book a table for the first seating. And got this reservation confirmed. We then were sent a SMS to the mobile phone, luckily we had a local number. I somehow doubt that the confirmation would have been sent to an overseas mobile number. We wanted to have a table in the smoking area... this being Singapore, we should have known this is a bit more complicated... Well, when we arrived, Jane, welcomed us showed us the smoking area and an option in the restaurant. We opted for the regular restaurant terrace. Nice forward thinking!We had the food of the daily special, which included soft shell crab, we also ordered crispy duck, etc. and had a good bottle of rose wine. The food was very tasty, the chili sauce served along with the soft shell crab, we could not stop eating it! The service, Jane, was great. She was very attentive, could give recommendations, etc.All in all we had a lovely evening, and even though there was a second seating, we were not asked to leave the restaurant and could continue our dinner at our pace
2
The ambience was wonderful - the guys that own this have a flair for design and great attention to detail. Everything was beautifully put together but the general experience was disappointing. The service, apart from one or two individuals, was generally appalling and the food was hit or miss. We had Bombay Gin & tonic, which was served diluted and a bottle of wine which was topped up by ourselves throughout the whole evening. One of the waitresses had her fingers all over the top of my partner's water glass when she tried to move the glass aside to pop the food down! We had the San Choy pal which we both agreed was really good. The filling was tasty and just a tad spicy which was a nice contract to the fresh lettuce wrap. The duck pao, we thought were very so-so. Interesting concept but the duck was done to death. For mains, we had the sweet & sour pork which was nice but nothing to shout home about, and the paper chicken which was extremely bland and tasteless. Overall experience was very poor. Will go there for ambience but never again eat there
4
I had dim sum with a friend back in early Dec this year, in this restaurant. We had duck bao, which was very similar to duck wrapped in pancake, cheong fun, dumpings, spring rolls and also chicken balls. Their chicken ball was quite special, the chicken was wrapped inside the ball. My friend had herbal infusion tea, whilst I had peppermint tea. We also shared a chili chocolate cake. It was a bit chili. The portion of the cake was huge, so we couldn't finish it

With a concept like American-Chinese food, you want to lighten up and have some fun. Enjoy the kitsch, explore the clichés, have a sense of humour.Unfortunately this restaurant by the PS Café group doesn't do any of those things, though we did have an odd salad in a ceramic coconut and the music was suitably Shanghai-lounge-divas.It's actually a beautiful black and white colonial interior, tucked in a quiet corner of Dempsey, with a fully-windowed sun-room looking out onto a courtyard. Upmarket, elegant and relaxing, with slightly formal service. If you didn't know the kitchen was playing with American concepts of Chinese food, there's nothing to give it away in the decor.So that makes the juxtaposition with a menu that includes Prawn Toasties and Chopsuey Chopsuey kind of jarring. It could have been so much fun, but it isn't.We had some good dishes and some incredibly bland ones. The menu is extensive and there are probably some gems hidden in there, so your mileage may vary. We were underwhelmed. I wasn't drinking on the night we visited, but there's a tempting list of cocktails in the $20 range.I found the whole thing a bit stiff. It's PS Café in upmarket mode, yet the food wasn't up to scratch. The concept has potential, but they really haven't matched it with the decor or the kitchen. It's like going to a fancy Western restaurant and ordering the fish and chips because it's ironic. It just doesn't work
4
Good atmosphere,excellent service and the menu was typical American Chinese
It really is NOT expensive.
The hot and sour soup was a bit bland but,if that's all I can think to complain about,then it's obviously a good place to go
4
This restaurant is situated on Dempsey Hill with many other great locales housed in the old British Barracks tastefully converted to a trendy area of shops and restaurants.If you want Chinese Food prepared and presented the Chinese way then I would not recommend this cafe.However, if you want a great dining experience with all the wonderful tastes of the orient, presented in the European way with beautiful asian flavours then this is the spot. We loved the simplicity of the dishes, the flavours and the presentation. The setting is colonial style and the ambiance is relaxing and charming.Service was quite good and the timing excellent. Another Great evening in Singapore

I had somewhat low expectations of Chop Suey cafe following lukewarm reviews both from Trip Advisor and friends. I came in for a quick weekend lunch so I'm not sure if I can make a final judgement based on my brief and casual experience, but in any case I was pleasantly surprised. The setting is gorgeous and reminds me of the Tiffin Room at the Raffles Hotel. We had a few nibbles to share, including the lettuce wraps, prawn & edamame dumpling and duck pancakes. The portions, presentation and taste were all very good. The service was alright - the waitress looked and behaved rather sour. I was intrigued by the creative Asian fusion dishes on the menu and look forward to coming back to try some more. I would definitely recommend this place to tourists and SG locals/expats entertaining overseas visitors

I am shocked to read the favorable reviews on this restaurant! It has nothing going for it besides it's location, which is charming. The service we received was appalling, it took over ten minutes for someone to take our order for drinks. When the drinks arrived, the waiter tipped some of my drink onto my plate by mistake, given it was his mistake, the least he could have done was bring me a fresh plate! Ordering dinner was another nightmare, we had to ask for service several times The 'host waiter/ captain' for the evening had an unacceptable attitude. The food then took over 30 minutes to arrive. When it finally arrived it was cold and the portions were tiny. The less said about the flavor of the food, the better. The evening ended with the 'host's' inability to swipe my American Express card. I had to visit his station to assist him! Never going back and never going to recommending it to anyone

Perhaps we were just unlucky with our main choices: sweet and sour chicken and the pork chop. Very unlike us to leave food, but my husband who loves pork, said the texture was awful and could not tell if he was eating soft fat or just very soggy pork. Came with chips apparently but they were drowned in the same sauce. Chicken was also over-fried and unpleasantly greasy. Not what I expected. Cocktails were good, but had been waiting at our table for 10mins and had to call a waiter before our drinks order was taken. The mains also came immediately after the appetisers, in fact they were still on the table. Personally I like a short break between courses. Seems that they do not really pay much personal attention to their tables /orders. Would go back for drinks and nibbles, but only because of the beautiful setting
4
I am surprised every time I read a negative review on this restaurant. The setting and food are of top quality with a wine list that is very competitive. The atmosphereof this restaurant is 2nd to none, the outdoor setting my favourite. There is not one dish that we have ordered where I have been disappointed. (If you are looking for authentic Chinese food this may not be the place for you.) Food Service is very attentive, much improved on the first few weeks of opening when they experienced the normal teething problems.I love this place and is always first choice when we have visitors or a special occasion.The people behind PS Cafes have done it again

composite score 9.9 out of 10!!! there are some bewildering negative reviews below which you really should ignore...food quality 10/10 (pow wow!) ~ value 10/10 (really reasonable) ~ decor 12/10 (absolutely beautiful) ~ ambience/comfort 10/10 ~ service 6/10 (head waiter was grrreat, the others, not so much

I have read far too many negative reviews about Chopsuey Cafe online but I'm afraid the reviewers have not made the connection. If you're expecting authentic Chinese cuisine, it will come as a surprise. The reason so many positive reviews come from Caucasians is that this is the Chinese food they are used to. I got the picture as this was food I used to eat at Chinese takeaways as a student. The difference is that at Chopsuey Cafe, they use better ingredients & the restaurant has a great beverage & wine list, not to mention a great ambience. Did I say black & white building in the Dempsey Hill district with George Gershwin & Cole Porter tunes emanating from the soundtrack? So there is a disconnect as you're expecting a menu more like the other PS Cafes, since this is the latest addition to the group.I ate lunch there recently with a friend & actually liked the food though it isn't the best Chinese I have had by far. What mattered was it tasted good. We ordered the mud crab friend rice, which was nicely done. It had a nice "wok hei" (wok breath) that permeated the rice. Not having eaten orange beef since my university days, it was a joy to find this on the menu. The dish was saved from gloopiness by the addition of fresh orange juice & the shreds of peel actually lifts the dish & lends it some freshness. The tofu & cashews fried with dried chillis in a Szechuan sauce was smoky & seriously morish. The only let down was the twice cooked french beans friend with minced chicken. The chef was seriously very heavy handed with the salt, rendering the dish almost inedible.I would actually come back as I like the ambience & the food although I would steer clear of the dim sum since they looked stodgy & leaden, judging from the baskets the next table were having. However there are two factors which if unchecked would prevent me from coming back.Firstly the prices are astounding - SGD 120 for two. In the old days there would be change left over for several meals if I ate at my neighborhood takeaway. This would also explain the shortage of Asian diners when we were there. The bulk of the customers were American ladies who lunch...and loud ones at that.Secondly, the service needs tweaking. Although I was seated promptly, it was hard to attract anyone's attention when it came to ordering or getting the check. Lunch service was over & the wait staff seemed preoccupied with clearing tables & chatting among themselves. After the food was served, no one even inquired if I was enjoying my food or if I needed anything else. They weren't rude, just not very attentive to their diners

During my most recent trip to Singapore, a friend took me to dinner at ChopSuey on Dempsey Hill in the Queenstown area. This former British Military Barracks has been transformed into some pretty cool and interesting restaurant. ChopSuey serves Anglo Chinese food, which is to say its full of taste, good meat and fresh veggies. I had the corn crab egg drop soup to start, and then the Steamed Paper Shaoshing Chi with Jasmine Rice. Then I finished with a Ginger and Lemongrass Cooler. Very nice. I'm looking forward to returning on my next trip to Singapore

Nestled in the corner of Dempsey Hill, this little gem was a complete surprise. The meals were outstanding, good sized portions with fantastic flavours. Wine list is small but adequate, well priced. Ambience perfect, lovely decor. It's hard to fault this restaurant. The only shortcoming was the service, a tad slow in the beginning. It was significantly better as the night wore on. We sat outside, it seemed the guests inside had more attention
5
Gorgeous inside and out.... I prefer the courtyard sitting.... Menu is tasty... Lovely flavours... Great to order different dishes and share kinda place.... Love the leafy setting... Dempsey hill is a perfect hang out!!!!
5
I've always like to sniff out some unknown place. This place is cool. Love their concept! Food is great too. I kinda peeped into the kitchen and realized their staff are wearing PS cafe tshirt and no wonder it's good. Well done!

Top quality and interesting take on international Chinese food. As usual, PS Cafe staff and service first rate. Good selection of unusual dishes, great drinks and great ambience. Fun for lunch and dinner.
5
I was taken by a colleague on a business trip and what a pleasant surprise. The building was a beautiful colonial style, the staff were great and the wine and food were both amazing. There Are some great specials, we had suckling pork sliders which were to die for!We all had a great night and I have been recommending to everyone

Our son took us to Chopsuey while we were visiting him in Singapore. Loved it so much we went back for our dinner on our last night in Singapore. Highly recommend it and the Singapore Slings are as good as the ones at Raffles. I'll be bac

It is obvious that Chop Suey is part of the PS Café family of restaurants. The actual restaurant looks totally great - the black and white theme is very effective and it creates a special kind of ambience. The food itself is interesting and whilst I enjoyed the food I can definitely see how it would not suit everyone and I think that reading through the reviews that shows pretty clearly. The service itself is a bit hit and miss. Initially the service was great and the menu was explained in great detail and with obvious passion and knowledge. However at times the wait staff showed that their knowledge of the menu and drinks in particular was a bit lacking. This is understandable for a relatively new restaurant. Towards the end of the night the service went missing and it was difficult to order additional drinks. Overall though I enjoyed the food and the great location and had a good night. And as Chop Suey refines some of the slight service issues it should transition into a great place to eat in Dempsey Hill
2
A wonderful location. A wonderful atmosphere. Then possibly the worst food I have tasted for many a year. OK if you get no further than the appetisers you may be ok. Duck pow pow was decent, coconut duck salad was ok. Then the main courses. God they were truly diabolical. Think appalling UK 70s Chinese food. Chips!!! covered in sweet and sour sauce We did ask ourselves why are we ordering these beforehand>>> I'm all for nostalgia but honestly!!. Lamb spare ribs, hope you like them sugar coated!! Chicken and chilli dish, just cloyingly coated with something sweet and horrible. Sweet and sour pork was straight out of the 70s without the batter, in fact the meat may have been cooked in the 70s!!The rice and vegetable dishes were ok but by then we were gone. Even felt duty bound to try a chocolate chilli dessert in the interest of objectivity. Hmmmmm. Just truly a shame, PS Group does more than a decent job in their cafes, this place promises much and delivers on occasion as long as you are happy with shockingly bad food
5
Tucked away in one of the glorious Dempsey Hill period buildings is this black and white joy. It is elegant, relaxed and charming. The food is even better. It is offers western and Chinese. I have enjoyed the Chinese food, and wow, what a treat. Some dishes took 8 months of trial and error to get the balance just right. Time very well spent in the pursuit of perfection. Ask the staff for suggestions. If you are no expert in Chinese cuisine like me, the staff will suggest some items that you may never have dreamt of. Sit back and share as many dishes as you feel like. You will have your pallet excited many times
4
mmm. PS Cafe quality - decor lovely, clean, making the most of the beautiful aspects of the old barracks. Food which delights, the Duck Pow Pockets very very more-ish. We followed these up with the Crispy Orange Beef and steamed mixed rice - great portion size for two, left wanting just that little bit more - which is a good thing! Ensures we will be back ;-
5
Full disclosure - I've known the owners for over 30 years... But this place really blew me away. The ordering was taken care of by my host (the brother of one of the aforementioned founders) and favored more vegetable dishes and salads, with a lighter selection of chicken and seafood and while so-called Asian fusion is a bit of a curate's egg on a good day, this was stellar. You could taste every single note of every vegetable and green - all organic and bursting with flavor.I favor the modern takes on the traditional kopi tiam favorites - you can't go wrong. Speaking of eggs, you MUST try the crackling eggs with basil and kicap manis. They are divine - one of the best creations I've ever tasted using the humble egg. I need to find out how to make this. In the same vein - no pun intended - there are delicious custards for desert. The bar offering for drinks is also excellent.They are keeping a low profile but they won't be able to do it with food and service like this- and the setting is really nice as wel
