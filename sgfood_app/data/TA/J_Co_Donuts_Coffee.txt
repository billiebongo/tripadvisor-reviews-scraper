The staff were all very nice and kind. The seating area however was not as clean as we had hoped. The good was not too bad, though we did a higher quality of coffee.

First rule of thumb upon walking into J.Co: don't assume you're leaving with just one donut. Options are endless and delicious. Therefore, it's hard to choose just one.
Best novel donut options in town. They even have tiny donut gift sets!

Went this morning with my sister and my niece, cashier name Yin so damn rude and no friendly at all ... very poor as a cashier

I intended to just have a iced coffee but ended up being caught by the smell of fresh donuts so sampled some and this one place to bypass if you are on a strict diet as they are great. The drinks were fine also.

Good for coffee and donuts. Great shakes. I frequent this place for a good hot chocolate, coffee in the morning and a chilled frozen drink.
5
We went multiple times for these donuts. One time we walked out with a box of 6 for two people. Get yourself a mix box!!!!!!

The plan was to eat a Heaven Berry every day that I was in Singapore. By Day 4 I was ready to try a different one - not that I no longer liked the Heaven Berry, but the cappuccino one (I can't recall the correct name) was beckoning. It was super yummy! So now I have two favourites. The coffee here is always good. They currently have a special: buy a coffee and you get two doughnuts for $2.40. My waistline was not impressed but my taste buds were :-)I'm still waiting for J Co to hit Australian shores ..

Back visiting Singapore once again. Dropped in here as we have never been disappointed. Gem of a little treat shop.My wife I enjoyed a donut each.Mine was choc crunch & the other was a snow white with cream in the middle.All for $3.80. Just a nice little filler after having lunch in another place

J Co is likely the most successful franchise ever for an Indonesian company. Wikipedia shows it has 187 in Indonesia, 14 in Malaysia, 38 in the Philippines, and 6 in Singapore. Obviously people (around the world) like the donuts and the sugar rush that goes with it. I do not buy the donuts or other sugar rush stuff very often but I have to admit J Co donuts are tasty. It's a real paradox that while Indonesia has millions of coconuts trees that it is still near impossible to find coconut flour. Even coconut oil is not easy to find. I can only hope that they will one fine day start making somewhat more healthy donuts and with more "homegrown" stuff such as the coconut flour and oil

Until I try J Co Donuts, I'm a hugh fan of Krispy Kreme (forget about Dunkin Donuts!). But now, I'm a J Co Donuts convert.J Co's donuts are a lot softer and not overly sweet as compared to KK and Dunkin... and definitely value-for-money and not overly priced ! Bought my J Co's donuts from Raffles City Shopping Mall in Singapore. Understand J Co's donuts are originally from Indonesia and available in Indonesia, Singapore, Malaysia, Philippines and Hong Kong..

J Co Donuts are a must when you visit Raffles City Shopping Centre. On recommendations from my son I purchased the box of 24 mini donuts which gives you 12 different flavours. Excellent value and already boxed for quick service.

Coffee tastes really watery, i even requested a double shot and it didnt satisfy. These people should not be making coffee, they have no idea.
5
I had a glazed donut, that was pretty nice it's cost was somewhere between 3-5$ it was pretty good. Worth Trying.
4
I visited J Co late evening for a quick bite, and ordered a coffee and a donut. The coffee was good and plenty. The donut was delicious, light, and fluffy. Overall it's a good value for money.
4
Several choices of doughnuts, not too sweet but filling. Enjoy munching with friends while sipping a good cup of coffee.
5
I think it's the Asian version of Starbucks, but the coffee is excellent and you get a free doughnut with every coffee. The doughnuts are fresh and light too!
5
First visited J.Co a few years ago, in Singapore. Have never found donuts as good as these. Glad they don't have the chain in England as I would be enormous! Visited Singapore during Chinese New Year, this year, so unfortunately they were closed most of the time we were there. Managed two donut sessions during our trip, which was nowhere near enough! Awesome

Being a Donut fan i tried this place as it was recommended by someone. And I can def say it's one of the best Donut I have ever had. Please do try it. There are various outlets. Wherever you see one do stop for a Donut.

Its not my first time in J. Co donuts but today i decided to share my review. I tried before their tiramisu, glazed, orea donuts but my all time J Co donut will be the Alcapone. Alcapone sweetness is just right with cream and sprinkled almond on it, which makes very good combination with coffee. Enjoy!

I went to the Jco Donut store at Paya Lebar Square today(03 March 2015) at around 7pm. The service was terrible and staff very rude. I ordered 2 donuts and a green tea becos i didnt want to consume caffeine at 7pm at nite. But the malay waiter put mocha whip cream on my green tea. I think he has no brain and just working like a robot. When I tell the Malay waiter his fault, he just said ' Then?' and gave me an attitude... I am no longer going to patronise the Jco Donut store at Paya Lebar Square from now on..

I love J Co!!! Way better than Starbucks and much cheaper!!
I really enjoyed their donuts as well. You get a free donut with coffee!!

If you are a lover of sweeter-than-normal kind of thing, then this is the food for you. I find it too sweet actually and it is of the overrated doughnuts on earth.
5
Heaven Berry donut: the most amazing, light, tasty, fresh, scrumptious donut I have ever had. I've just returned from KL and Singapore and was happy to have found stores in both places. I hope J.Co come to Australia.
5
Fresh, sweet, full of flavors and delicious... I never miss a trip to j co's if I'm Singapore.. They always have fresh donuts, slightly expensive but don't mind paying more for quality. Delicious

My kids love the donuts here but they're too sweet to my liking. They have a lot of flavours to choose from. Can give it a try,
4
Now i'm a Krispy Kreme fan BUT i think i've found a rival, we stayed in Singas for 7 days and every morning i would make my way down to J Co for a caramel chiller and a doughnut or 2 (you get a free doughnut with your drink) so if your'e in Singas and you're hangin for a doughnut drop in to J co they have a great selection (i like the peanutbutter one) and their always fresh. the service is ok depending where you go and there can be a bit of a language barrier, but not as bad as Thailand or Bali

I have notice one thing in Singapore that as for food, it is not so tasty, it's rather mild but when it come to dessert, My God!...It is like you eat pure sugar alone..it so sweet. For Donut, the topping cream is so sweet-too sweet. May be Singaporean need more Energy so they have to eat Sugar ! I have not idea why it 's so famous in so many Asian Country. When come to Donut.I prefer Dunkin Donut or Mr. Donut. Krispy & Kream is also sweet but less than J.Co. Anyway, those who like sweet donut...you might love it. As for Coffe or Tea, nothing much to talk about. It's as good as other places

JCO itself is a reputable store, but you mixed it with staff that have as flat affect as schizophrenia then the store ambience feels like you are in a nightmare! We were there 7.40pm on October 17, 2013 at Raffles City branch. Hope the manager can see who is on duty that hour, prime them please to at least learn how to serve customers very well

Based in the basement of Raffles City Mall in North Bridge Road just opposite Raffles Hotel. We went in on the off chance to give them a try and went back 3 times during our 6 day stay. On the last visit we had two each (Heavenly Berry and a Lychee one) both very nice. One word of advice they are very sticky toppings so use two forks to rip them into manageable pieces and don't be afraid to scrape the plate clean or even lick it clean if you have no scruples in a public place!!!

I loved J.co when I have tasted their donuts. great flavor less the extra sweetness compared from other brands. what I did not like though on a JCO branch in Eastwood, while we were cozy sitting on their shop, I saw one employee scoop a fruit from the toppings bar and put it in her mouth. I am was not sure if she used the little spoon or the serving spoon itself but seeing an employee behave like that when you know it's food that they would serve you, it's just a turn off. So I am concerned if they are really careful on the way the employee handle the food. on the donuts, I saw no incriminating evidence so fa

This place serves very fresh and delicious donuts plus excellent cold drinks (warm ones too but we have not tried those yet)
3
Just had a rather tasteless and flat cappuccino here. ( In Raffles Marketplace vitality court ) Perphaps the food is great; I only bothered to write the review because for the same $5.20 you can get awesome coffee elsewhere.
5
Our first visit was not our last. The donuts were excellent and reasonably priced. The coffee was good and the service efficient. We went back and back.
3
Quite pricy for the average donuts dished out. Wide array but so so in taste. I only like the green tea version. That still doesnt stop others from queuing to buy them.
5
I like their donuts and frozen yoghurt.The service was ok and nothing major happened.
5
Delicious every time! One is faced with a choice of at least 20 different tasting doughnuts with names like Snow White, Tiramisu, Berry Heaven, Mango Tango, a Leonardo diCaprio avocado doughnout, a green tea one, chocolate, caramel - the list goes on. Always fresh, slightly warm served with various coffees - hot or cold, large or small, with milk , without. The choice is yours. Have a peek at the frozen yoghourts with the many toppings. Once you enter J.Co, you will find it difficult to leave without having a full tummy. Put this on your list of eating places to visit - and forget about the diet

I ordered a donut and a green tea there.Donut was OK, but nothing special...If you want to order a drink (cofee, tea,..) : you have to do a second queue to get your beverage, which is not very convenient.Expect to wait 5 to 10 minutes before being served (was there a 2pm

The variety of doughnuts and hot beverages is enormous and tempting , although we were careful not to over - indulge ( difficult! ).This was a good place to stop for coffee and a bite whilst rambling around Raffles City.Food quality was excellent , staff very efficient and friendly
3
I had the tuna donut sandwich that's pretty good. The staff was very helpful and highlighted the econimical breakfast special, which i had, thus value for money. The dining area is quite basic but its a bit dark. I would go again if i m around the area and hungering for fast foo

I had never quite liked donuts before. Many people had recommened the JCO at basement of Raffles City but I did not go there.Then one day just happened to buy one from there.OMG! that was so good and yummy. And on top of that so fairly priced! Top it all with the good ambience and service. Its a winner by all means for people with a sweet tooth.I recommend the donuts there .... especially the ones with fillings inside. But I do not recommend the coffee there. I am a coffee lover and I did not like the coffee there. Would rather go to Coffee Bean or StarBucks.Hope my review was useful. Thanks
5
Great coffee and ice drinks, a large variety of delicious donuts.
3
We tried the J Co Donuts and Coffee. Coffee ok, but the donuts seemed a bit too chewy and the icing was runny, not set. Friendliness of service was good. Maybe I just got them on a bad day for the donut chef!
5
great quality a must try, fresh chocolate on most of them.
5
Great variety of donuts and coffee. Fresh, soft and space to sit and enjoy the snack.
5
Bloody delicious! My new favourite is the Avocado DiCaprio - yes, a donut with an Avocado cream filling...not as unpleasant as it sounds!
5
I loved it very much.al capone and don machino perfect.Amazing.Thanks JCO,singapore ,nyummy.
