We had one chicken and one mutton biryani amongst 3 people. Meat was succulent and the rice was cooked well. Both biryanis disappeared quickly !
4
Enjoyed my lunch 'promotion' of Mutton Marsala, Cheese Nan and soft drink given the price. Not an overgenerous portion of the mutton but very tasty sauce. The language barrier did not detract from the efficient yet unsmiling service
4
I ate there years ago and tried it again yesterday. Quality and portion sizes have been maintained. I was not disappointed. The chicken biranyi was tender and basmati rice was tatsefully cooked. Adding the mixed vegetable curry and lassi balanced the meal for me.Recommendation: If you eat the biranyi .... share !!! I won't suggest rthat you order one each and add side dishes too unless you've just been released from a concentraron camp, For 2 people, 1 biranyi plus 2 sides will be fine, or if there are 3 of you, then 2 biranyi plus 2 or 3 sides will be enoutgh and a balanced variety of food

My dinner at this restaurant was chicken curry. The location of the restaurant is very good, the service was excellent, the restaurant was very clean. I would have been more pleased with the meal if there had been more chicken and fewer chicken bones. The curry was quite good

We were looking for lunch when we looked at 'tis place.There was s lunch special.We had a North Indian combo and a chicken dish.Both came with naan bread.The staff were friendly,the service was quick,the good was tasty.The portions weren't large but it was surprisingly filling.We would definitely go back

The place looked decent from the outside and there where “locals” eating there so I thought I’d give it a try. Friendly staff, quick service. I ordered a chicken curry, rice and naan. The service was quick. The food arrived before I was half way through my pint. I would have given it an extra star if the portions were larger.

The reason for my bad review is Horrible service and Mia leading promotion. There are hyd chicken dum biryani with drink at 10.90$ and the same with out drink is 11.90$ in the main menu. But the quantities in the both are different. The one with drink is half of the quantity of main. Service toook 30 mins after order placed. No humble and good staff... when we asked about the quantity difference then the staff convinced that it is the promotion strategy and if I need extra then he will bring with extra cost at discounted price...
1
Our visit started off with they seemingly not wanting to take our order. Then when we ordered the promotion was not available for no apparent reason. Then we finally order food anticipating something very special knowing we'd pay around $20 for a meal.After a very long wait some of our food arrived, however it was not what we ordered. We got different dishes from what we ordered and some dishes never came at all. When we asked for our food they were very unfriendly saying we already got our food. Even when we asked for some napkins they acted like it we were asking them to cure cancer. And after 2 hours some of us had to reorder our food... To be fair the food we did get was OK, but not much better than your average hawkers stall which serves it at 1/3 the price. My advise: DON'T GO THERE!! It's not worth the money and definitely not worth dealing with the terrible service.
1
After 1,5 hours of waiting half of us had not had their food yet. The other half had already finished. On top of that, more than half of the food we got was different from what we ordered. After five times of asking for napkins we were still waiting with dirty hands. At some point the waiters even started ignoring us. After two hours of waiting I they asked me to order again. As I'm writing this review we still didn't get our napkins, I didn't get any food I ordered and I'm afraid that I'll be charged $20 when I leave
5
From the moment I walked in (alone), I was greeted with a great smile. The waiter was patient and helpful. Food portions were large, and I couldn't finish about a third of what I ordered. You can tell them how spicy or not you want your curry. I ordered a hot butter chicken, but I think I'll get very hot next time. The atmosphere was pleasant, and I never felt uncomfortable being alone. Highly recommend
4
Really good food! Super nice manager who helped me to pick what I want! It's a bit pricey for the amount of food you get but I really enjoyed it!
3
Its a good choice to eat in the Indian neighbourhood, close to a nice colonial building. Food is good and well spiced, prices are low for the daily menus. Dishes and glasses are not so clean, better drink from the bottle.
1
Not hygienic - dirty plates and glass
Not worth to money spent - quality is ok but overpriced
Ambience is average, not better than a normal hawker center yet charging as good as a proper restaurant
Service is also very slow
4
Called into Amsravati for a late lunch with friends and found the staff very friendly and helpful in our food selection. Butter chicken and chicken masala very tasty. Beer cold and hit the spot.
4
We enjoyed of one of the best currys ever tasted.. Nice place in the middle of Little India.. nice menu packs and offers.. everyrhing clean and well served.. but no hurried at all ... take your time.. take a place and just enjoy everyrhing
4
Restaurant is a bit inside the street next to little India but don't give up because the food is excellent. Had Andhra Veg meals - spicy & delicious curries, fresh roti, rice and Sweet lassi. Service was excellent !!!
4
Excellent, Tasty and spicy food, friendly staff. We love the Avakai chicken biriyani, Nellore chicken biriyani, Garlic Naan. Rest room is smelly and dirty. Don't go on sunday night and public holiday night.
5
Walked in with a group of 12 and was helped right away! Our server was so kind and helped me find great vegan options! Thank you for a beautiful night!
3
The restaurant smelled weird inside. The person who took my order doesn't seem to understand Indian food, claiming that Korma is southern food. The chilli fish was good. But I was rather surprised by the sizes of the dishes. I have eaten in many indian restaurants all over the world (including India), and this one is rather ordinary
4
Our group of four stumbled across Amaravati Restaurant in Singapore's "Little India" district quite by accident, but what a happy accident. Not really knowing what we wanted to order, but all loving Indian food, we sought recommendations from our lovely waiter. After ascertaining that we were all happy to experiment, no food allergies, and enjoying spicy food, he made some suggestions and we agreed to the lot. Everything that came out to the table was delicious, and we were all very happy with every dish. The waiter, and then another man who was perhaps the manager or owner, came and chatted to us about the food we were eating and gave us a bit of background about each dish. All in all, this was a great experience, good service and tasty food. Next time we're in Singapore, we'll be back
5
Stumbled upon this resturant whilst on my visit to Singapore. Very Friendly staff and incredible food!! The servings are a little small, but the quality is worth it! Would come back here anytime.
4
I just went in for a quick lunch, the food was pretty good. The staff was very helpful with suggesting places to go in little India and giving me directions. Overall, not a bad place to stop and eat!
4
Happened to come across this nice restaurant at Little India for lunch. A variety of set menus is offered and I had the Chicken Tikka Masala with the garlic naan. Not spicy and tastes very authentic. Highly recommended for solo lunches.
5
Coming to little India for our Dinner. Mice Service- good food and Indian beer. Er enjoyed our stay. Good choice to stay here for dinner.
4
This place is becoming my go to for my spice fix. Amaravati isn't cheap compared to the other restaurant in the hood but the food and service makes up for it. The Thalis are great value for money. And I'd recommend their gongura chicken.
4
The food was well cooked to our requests (a variety of mild and spicy) and was tasty. The naan bread was a bit disappointing though.
The location is nice (sat outside).
The strong kingfisher beer was really nice - and cheap!
5
We happened to stumble upon this place and thank God we did. The staff were absolutely lovely. They helped us understand the menu and recommended certain dishes. I asked for a 5 and my partner asked for it to be 7 on the hotness scale. Our food came and it was amazing. The flavours were awesome. I think they happen to mix up the hotness as mine was more spicy then my partners but it was still amazing. The staff came around to check how it was and I commented that it was amazing and that I think mine was hotter and they immediately insisted on giving us dessert on the house. I've never been somewhere that the staff where so helpful and lovely. They were that amazing that I'm still sitting in the restaurant eating while writing this.
5
We came here the night after visiting a top rated restaurant nearby that had left us disappointed.Amaravati was not only way, way better, it cost less and the staff were friendlier.You can eat cheaper in Little India, but you won't eat better. This place is now the standard by which I'll judge others.A famous Australian was known for telling people at the end of a review to "do yourself a favour", the same goes here
3
We went into Amaravati on a whim for lunch. The meal was surprisingly delicious. Neither dish was spiced beyond the ability to appreciate the food (although I am sure you could ask for a spicier version) and went very well with the bottle of Kingfisher. I only wish I remembered the name of what we order!Although a bit chaotic not what you could consider a charmer, it is far calmer then some of the other options in the area
4
We went there to have a dinner in Little India. Luckily this place is very close the MRT station called Little India, it is easy to find. When you have a look at surroundings, you would think that credit card would not function here... But it does.We had great dinner of : Gongura Chicken Curry, Chicken Tikka Masala and Vegetarian meal. The service was very quick and friendly, everything was correct and the meal was finished with Mango Lassi. Just perfect! I can recommend all of these meals above, they tasted great
4
My wife had a Prawn marsala and Jeera rice and I had the Tandoori Chicken Biryani. Superbly tasty and very reasonable by Singapore standards. Would definitely try it again when in the neighbourhood
1
This is not andhra food. We order veg and non-vegetarian meal. Took 1.30 HR to get food. Services is so bad. When I ask them they said wo guys did not show up to work. Who know. I don't think next time I go there?
5
Had a great meal at this restaurant and the staff were lovely and friendly. The Gongura Mutton Curry was superb!
4
V had our lunch s well s dinner over thr, truly enjoyed dinner.. On request they serve us pure jain food... Quantity s well s quality both are nice... On our next visit v vl definitely gng to visit d hotel...
4
Went about 10.30pm. Great food. Friendly staff. Superb curry. It's definitely what you should expect, don't expect a posh place with smartly dressed staff, it is very authentic. It's clean and in the middle of little India "like a diamond in a turd" as the rest of the place is a s***hole. Would recommend and go again. One of the best curries I have ever had
5
Our last day in Singapore went to LIttle India, needed to charge my mobile phone and asked the Manager of the Amaravati if he could do it for me, he was so helpful we sat down and ate an amazing meal and beer, at a fraction of the price of others in the neighbourhood, so, a great find
1
I dont know where to start! It is expensive, very small amount of food. They made a mistake with our naan ( we had one more) and he take it out of our plate with his hand ( the one he left!). I ask not spicy at all and it was very spicy. Toilet are durty and no toilet paper... very disapointed and they are not honest... The food you get is very different than the picture! Especialy the quantity
1
We saw the boards advertising a main dish & beer for $12 so we went for dinner. We were immediately discouraged from ordering the $12 meal by the waiter, that menu is only available outside on the boards and not advertised inside at all. We ordered Butter Chicken Marsala with unlimited naan bread for $15, and Poppadoms to start. We watched other diners receive Poppadoms before us even when they ordered after, we then did get 2 very very small roasted PadPads (we think) not wanting to complain we tried the PadPads, (raw red onion with an extremely spicy powder on a burnt small Poppadom). Our butter chicken arrived, both were full of small bones, grisly and fatty and mine had the addition of 2 hairs! We ordered extra of the unlimited Naan and after asking for it twice we watched the waiter serve himself Naan for his dinner, by the time ours arrived the rest of our dish was cold. At one stage a waiter appeared with a chicken dish which we advised him we didn't order, he argued repeatedly that we did, then took it away, he was dripping with sweat. We asked for the bill but eventually gave up waiting despite being 1 of only 4 occupied tables and went to the counter to pay, fortunately the terrible service continued and they missed our incorrect starters off our bill.

This is one of several visits to this restaurant. The food is always good. However # different dishes were delivered to the table over a 35-40 minute period, even when the restaurant was not busy. Only recommended if you have a lot of time to kill.
4
The food was delicious but the portions were small (not as pictured). We both opted for lunch specials. My fiancé had the North Indian lunch special which was a tasting plate and I had the butter chicken and cheese naan. The coke that comes with the meals was probably 100ml max so the photos are a bit misleading (as are the portion size photos) but we both had enough to eat and weren't really concerned with the coke. Both meals were really good and we'd go back again.

Went for a birthday party
No Aircon, quite suffocating
Average food quality
Poor service quality
Unhygienic toilets
Never suggest

I am not very experienced with Indian food but I had a sort of mixed platter and it was full of tasty things.I loved it and it was a good price too
4
Good food. At first we were a little skeptical because of the language barrier but turned out damn good. The naan bread was delicious, curry chicken was very tasty and of course good fresh rice (yes rice).
1
Short and simple, if you know what is Indian food. Better don't go there. Literally disgusting foo. Worst customer service, they just destroying Indian food name. I fell shame because they are running restaurant on the name of India.
5
Nice welcome from Mr. Sunil. Good sign: quite a few locals in the restaurant or having takeaways. Nice portions (could not finish my Biryani...!). Well priced and very authentic.
5
Very friendly staff. Went for something different and tried the Chicken Chettinadu curry that the waiter recommended - and was delicious.
Will be back to try the ready of the menu.
5
Amaravati is a great authentic Indian. Beautiful dishes like Biriyani, tikka, filled roti etc. Enjoy a fresh mango lassi and one of the naan breads or papadum. Prices are very good and very friendly staff. The area is great to walk around (little India) and visit one of the temples
5
Me and my gf (Norwegians) had the vegetarian mix. All the dishes tasted really good, we got as much food as we wanted, the service was excellent and the interior was fascinating and genuine. Perhaps the best Indian food I've had. Minor minor fault: The music playing on the radio should have been Indian and not boring western :) But all in all: super
5
It is frequented by locals - which says a lot about how good the food is. I had some chicken tandoori and the spice blend on the meat was absolutely exquisite. It is also a place that sells beer, which is actually a bit of a luxury in Little India. The staff were attentive and very friendly
5
You no longer have to crave for a visit to Hyderabad to have Biryani. It is right here in Singapore.. fortunately and finally.. after a 4 year long wait. So far, Biryani at Amaravathi is the best in Singapore. No other restuarant which claim they cook so called Hyderabadi Biryani is anywhere near.Thanks to the restaurant management for appointing a special Bawarchi from Hyderabad. In less than 2 months, I visited more than 10 times. All for the slurppy...yummy.. gourmet biryani.Good going..
5
Nice find, food was tasty, would definitely return for another visit. Recommended the lamb Malalai and butter nan
5
Must visit in Little India! Amazing food, staff, and great atmosphere. Easy location to find. So much to choose from!!
4
meal is just great! wholesome food with reasonable price. People are good , ambience is class. walkable distance from little india mrt exit on buffalo road.
5
What pleasent surprise to stubble upin this awesome restaurant that had me missing home. Love the mutton beyani made exactly as i ordered. Nana and butter paneer also recommended.
5
This is a family run establishment in little India, Singapore. The food is great and the owners are friendly and good to have a chat with. Highly recommend this place either for lunch or dinner.
4
While in Little India, I was really hungry for good Indian food, so I chose this restaurant.I ordered the Butter Chicken and I wasn't disappointed! It was delicious!The service was very good and the atmosphere was ok, but was what I expected for the neighborhood!They also offered their free wifi !
5
Ambience is of upper class. Cleanliness is superb.Service is prompt and friendly, one of the best I've seen. Menu is very Indian Traditional, not much varieties of other local tastes.Quantity is very filling, though it looked small at first glance. A little bit pricey for price wise but still affordable range.As they explained they are undergoing some transition,thus as a bar place they really lacked on cocktails variety and also music
5
We arrived for a spot of lunch and we're quickly shown to a table. Very friendly and helpful waiter who guided us through the menu. Food was delicious and plentiful. The owner told us it was the best restaurant and I agree with her. Would definitely recommend a visit
5
The Amaravati is located in the Little India enclave of Singapore. It is adjacent to the brightly colored building that may the most photographed spot in Singapore. The restaurant itself is also brightly colored outside. Inside, it is a nice, smallish restaurant with a large selection of delicious Indian food. We were greeted upon entering by the owner's son, who also made recommendations on what to order. His suggestions were outstanding as we had two very tasty chicken dishes, one spicy the other not. Prices were reasonable, for two of us our lunch came to about $US20. A visit to Little India would not be complete without a visit to the Amaravati - highly recommended

Initially service was excellent and a couple helped us decide on best dishes to order from varied menu. The food was also very good We ordered meat and vegetarian dishes and all were great, especially vegetable biriani. The lime juice was not fresh, even though it said so on the menus, and we had ordered 2, asking for no sugar or salt. We were brought very sweet lime juices that were not fresh, probably packet/ bottle. What was most disappointing was that when we said this didn't match the description the waitress started to argue with us that it was fresh, and then said that in Singapore bottled lime juice is considered fresh and that it had no added sugar, because she hadn't added any. I know this is not true because I ve seen fresh lime juice made in the market in china town just 2 km away the day before. She then offered to bring me lime water, water with a bit of lime, which was nice, but we were still charged almost $4 a glass for something we didn't order. Although the food was delicious the service from the waitress was mostly disappointing, and for me this marred the overall experience, and undermined the quality of service of the rest of the staff.
5
Amazing food and incredible service! Second time trying Indian food and server was patient and offered mutilple options, composing the whole meal. Couldnt have been happier with everything. Delicious!!!
4
Had dinner here last night and food was very good. Service a little slow but the taste and flavor of our dinner made up for that. Find it in Little India you will enjoy. Make sure you try the Chicken Biriyani
5
Stumbled upon this place and I am glad I did! Good is tasty and the place and service are very welcoming. They even changed my main when told them it was a bit too spacy. Would come back again!
5
Unexpected find while leaving Little India to Clarke Quay. Food was delicious & staff were very helpful & friendly. Check it out!!
4
This is a small and basic restaurant but food is delicious, service is great, beer is cold and air con welcoming! All under the welcoming and glowing smile of the owner. Would definitely come back , thanks!

Stumbled on this place while visiting little India and were glad we did. Oredred a lunch special which was only about $SG 8 and came with 3 types of curry, rice and a great Japati. There was still an amount of rice left so they kindly offered more of the curry to finish up the rice. The owner and staff were very friendly and helpful despite having a dispute with the rude aggressive Coke man.(something I have witnessed in several countries around the world).Not expensive and genuine Indian food
5
Found this place while roaming around little India. The board said Andhra cuisine.. had to try it. The food turned to be more than I could expect in singapore. Food is freshly cooked so it takes some time but it's worth waiting for the amazing food they make. It's my 5th visit in last one month. The best Hyderabadi biryani I had just feels like I was having a biryani in Hyderabad
4
We stopped for a meal here not knowing what to expect and were pleasantly surprised. The menu seemed extensive enough but was all in Indian so was a bit difficult to understand, our waitress had little English so that didn't help, so we ordered and thought 'we'll see what we get'.! Food was great, had a couple of starters then prawn and a chicken biryani and some vegetable dish of something, some ice cold beers, and left feeling pretty satisfied. Don't expect to walk out spending $30 for 2 people, our bill was $80, although $27 was for beer, well worth a visit

So, lots of 'Recommended on Trip Advisor ' stickers on the door attracted us in. The photos of the meals on display outside looked appealing so our expectations had been established by the restaurant. Inside, there were maybe nine or ten tables, all busy except for three that had not been cleared from previous customers. We were waved to any table we wanted. We sat down and waited. After a few minutes, staff cleared dishes off a different table as soon as another customer came in. We then moved the bulk of the used dishes off our table on to another table, leaving the condiments on ours. Eventually our orders were taken, neither of the menu selections two of us selected were available, so other choices made. We were asked if we wanted drinks, and we sought clarification that the lunch menu s came with drinks as the photos showed. We were advised 'Yes, but only Pepsi'. We responded that would be fine. Still no table clearing, wiping or replenishing supplies such as water, cutlery or napkins was done. We sat there waiting with anticipation as we saw other diners great looking meals coming out, and eventually ours were delivered to our table. However that was not before one of the staff came and took the condiments away and gave them to another (local) diner.The drinks were 3-4oz, and mostly ice. At least they were cold! The food sadly was also cold, very small portions bearing almost no resemblance to the photos on display. Now I get some creative license is okay, but this was beyond the bounds of reasonableness. I then got up went to one of the other tables that had been cleared to get cutlery and napkins for us as the one remaining fork was not going to work well for the four of us...Now my dilemma- the food actually tasted really good! We will never return to this place. I believe Trip Advisor's name and reputation are being taken advantage of as a marketing ploy. I have attached photos of what is being displayed outside as on the menu, and a photo of what was actually served. This was supposedly the North Indian set meal lunch promotion.

Best Indian Food and the Cheapest beers in Singapore. The Waiter is a Little Old Chinese guy who is very unassuming and honest to a fault. The chef hails from middle of India and can whip up anything from Northern to Southern Indian styles without any trouble! The beers are cold and as well priced as Australia. The high taxes don't seem to be a problem here! I have come back more than once for the relaxed dining experience, quality of the food and those sweet cheap cold Coronas!!
