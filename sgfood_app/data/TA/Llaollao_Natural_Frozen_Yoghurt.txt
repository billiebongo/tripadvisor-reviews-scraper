If you are looking to have frozen yogurt then this is the best place in Singapore. Their serving sizes are huge - and the toppings are also yummy. Excellent snack! Had it on more than one occasion.
5
This place is so delicious and is such good value for money! We had the sanum so you had 3 fruits, 2 crunches and 1 sauce. It was refreshing and what we needed.
4
We had three frozen yogurts at the Marina Bay Sands outlet on our first day in Singapore, absolutely lovely. Two Red Queen and one Bariloche, which contained yogurt, strawberries and banana. The perfect thing to cool us down as we walked around the city.
5
I used to really like Yogurtini until I tried Llaollao's original frozen yogurt. I understand why people are willing to spend their time lining up just to get one cup of frozen yogurt. Would definitely try different flavors the next time I visit Singapore.
5
I felt so so so delicous yogurt cream with fruit. It's very special. And you can mix with chocolate candy or candy if you like. It made me want to come back Singapore again and again...
3
Don't understand what all the fuss about. Just an average dessert.
Can skip if there is a queue...not worth your time to queue.
5
First time I tried llao llao and I am now addicted to it. It's fresh, it's delicious and above all, it's very healthy. Wish they open more stores in Singapore.
4
Of all of the branches of this frozen yogurt chain, I find the Marina Bay one the best. Not only is it staffed by friendly faces, but the choice of toppings are often twice those at other locations. The hardest part is sticking to their lovely healthy options (e.g. fresh fruit and cereal crunches) when there is so much decadent chocolate, caramel and candy on offer. Regardless of what path you follow the food is always fresh and the service is always speedy. This branch takes cards, but others only take cash so make sure you have cash on you (especially when you are with hungry kids)
5
Coming from the US, I normally prefer the self serve frozen yogurt bars. This place, however, blew them all out of the water! They really show the meaning of less is more. They only had two flavors of frozen yogurt; plain tart and mango. I got the plain tart and my husband got mango. They were both amazing. Then we were allowed three toppings. I got mangoes, strawberries and the chocolate sauce. Fruit was so fresh and the chocolate was decadent. I loved it so much I went back the next day
4
Spread all over singapore, these outlets serve delicious frozen yogurt with a vast variety of toppings to chose from. Grab one to beat the heat or to swap with unhealthy 5 pm snacks. Must visit when you are in Singapore . Comes in different cup sizes, they are good to fill your tummy on the go
4
I tried one of the frozen yogurts with fruit and 'crunch' and it was very nice, refreshing and tasty.
5
By now, Llao Llao has a lot of branches all over Singapore. it is definitely my favourite frozen yoghurt brand, and even tried it in Spain! I do find it a little expensive and wish it could be a little cheaper.
5
We had our fix at their outlet in Marina Bay Shoppes foodcourt. There was a long queue but we were served soon enough. Natural frozen yogurt with fresh fruits, bare or with any of their toppings, yummmm!
4
Visited this outlet with a friend right after lunch. This outlet has seats. The medium serving comes with 3 toppings. Worth it and tasted good.
5
We went to this frozen yoghurt shop to have something sweet in the evening. The frozen yoghurt as well as the toppings were really yummy. We would definitely come back.
3
Average yogurt that's slightly pricey, something I don't understand why the queue and hype reflects otherwise. Will only indulge if there is no other better yogurt choice.
5
love everything about this yogurt.. is really no. 1 European yogurt in Asia. from the toppings. fresh fruits. and yogurt. is what you need to refresh your day in this summer season. definitely will return for sure.
a must try dessert
4
The large size at $6.90 with 3 toppings is mat value for money. My Husband and I always share a cup which is really satisfying.
4
I'm new to the delights of frozen yoghurt, but it's very nice. You are kind of expected to know the routine of what gets added where and when, which I think is a little prescriptive. For example I didn't want chocolate sauce, but the option I selected included the cost of it. Small point, but tasty anyway
4
Their yoghurt servings can be big enough to share, or for one with a big sweet tooth. What makes them different are the toppings that they have which gives it the extra flavor or twist. They do have some seats, but its not enough for those who patronize the place. In our case, we waited until tables became available. They use clear enamel tables and chairs. The problem with enamels is that they break, and a few of the chairs show cracks where the bolts are located. Maybe they should have more more chairs available to allow more guests to squeeze on each table. Anyway, people like us who go here doesn't need table space since we are only eating yoghurt in cups. What we need are more chairs
5
the appearance itself i cant resist plus the spoon is cute. a bit pricey but yummy, i got mine sprinkled with oats and fruits :)
1
Yucks! Dirty n unhygienic ! NEVER EVER GO BACK AGAIN !!! DISGUSTING ! Terrible Service Crew !!!!! If you ever want to try , be sure u got a clean cup
5
Would highly recommend this frozen yogurt. Have been there over 50 times already. Try the white chocolate topping, it's really yummy not like other froyo places. Unique experience with their signature spoons. toppings amount has reduced. Become abit stingy with it in some branches.
4
Had the sandman at the Vivi City outlet. Had almonds, strawberry, grapes, kiwi topped with chocolate muesli and topped with dark chocolate. Very pretty and agenerous serve. Very tasty however the sweet flavours with the sour yoghurt took some getting used to.
5
For 7 Dollars you can choose your Fruits, Toppings and Crunch.. and it tastes fab ! Its a must try in Singapore.
5
I love the yoghurt and the fresh fruit with superb biscuit sauce.. Love this so much! however the amount of yoghurt not all the same it depends on the person doing it.. But will definitely buy everyday!
4
If you are taking away, please remember to put it in freezer. I like the toppings especially the dark chocolate and the sunflower seed.
Even if you are to eat the yoghurt without any topping, it will still be delicious.
4
The yoghurt is rich but not overpowering. There is only one flavour. The sanum at $6.50 is value for money where you choose your crunch and/or fruit and sauce. However it can be too much for one person. The small cup with one topping is $4.90. I thought this is good enough. Service is usually fast. Try it
5
Llaollao comes with a good selection of toppings to add to the low-fat froyo: syrups and jams, biscuits and chocolate chips, fruits slices, and chocolate-flavored sauces. They're a bit expensive, but what you get is usually fulfilling and tasty enough to make up for it. It's ideal for an evening snack or desert
5
My friends and I are sourcing for some dessert after our heavy dinner on friday night. After walking around bugis and bugis+, they are quick to point out Llaollao yoghurt.Yoghurt itself is normal I guess but what make it so special is their ingredient. Really spoilt with choices. I go for rum n raisin sauce, cookies and cream. There are many choices to pick and it can get really crowded with limited chairs available. If you are into yoghurt or dessert, this is one of the new dessert hot topic for 2016. Enjoy
4
It taste great as it is fresh and delicious. They have various of topping you can choose and sauce. My preference was the dark chocolate sauce and Oreo biscuit. The price I personally think is reasonable for great quality food.
4
I always go for the fruity toppings. No sweet stuff. It feels healthy and tasty!the sanum is the favourite amongst many buyers.
3
Treated myself to the yoghurt here. It is tasty and delicious. You can choose fruit toppings if you are health conscious. It is a great treat for myself!
4
Really nice to know that the taste has not lose its quality when it is in another branch. I tried this in Bugis+ and all I can say is that it taste fabulous.
5
Tried the berries on yogurt and mangoes on yogurt, and they were amazingly good! A healthy choice indeed!
4
Came across Llao Llao stall and the queue was short. Promptly joined the queue for an afternoon treat. Ordered the llao llao yoghurt with for 3 topping: muesli with chocolate, fresh cut mango and Raffaello sauce (which had coconut and white chocolate).This is a very nice combination of toppings and I loved it. Will order this again the next time
4
Everytime I see a branch of llao llao here in Singapore, there are long lines which made me curious about the taste. I'm not a yogurt fan, but I still tried to buy one. I ordered "coconut", yogurt shake mixed with banana and chocolate. And I say, its worth it and it's very yummy!
4
This french brand which been famous in span is Magnificent. Said it is healthy, natural but for sure it delicious. And its so fun to choose your own topping of granola and fruits. Dellllliiiciioouusss! Becareful though, despite its huge portion which could make you feel soo stuffed, you may get addicted to it.
4
I was impresssed by my godbrother and partner that showing me the wonderful of this place...I do not have sweet tooth (by this age ... lolx) adding to that was my birthday and was ordered this Yoghurt!...Initially I wasn't sure what am I going to do with this little cup till I duck in. It was refreshing and not that sweet with healthy topping (fruits). It was a wonderful birthday present dessert...Good job Llaollao! I even recommended others to have this as and when I saw this shop islandwide. Thank you and making my birthday complete

First of all, I would just like to say: do not go if you have gone before in your country. The Llao Llao in your home country will be the same as the Llao Llao in Singapore. This place is not Singapore-exclusive or anything. With that out of the way, I can begin reviewing. The first thing that I noticed about Llao Llao was how there were no "premium flavours" that you could not touch unless you paid more. Everything was available, and you could put anything as long as it did not exceed your topping limit. I believe this is one of the best things about Llao Llao. So the general consensus would be that the toppings woould be some lacklustre ones, right? Wrong! All toppings are of top quality, and there are also some very interesting and delicious toppings hiding in there- like Biscoff spread! Now the yoghurt itself: It is very tasty and smooth, although slighlty acidic and salty. I would not mind having it on its own. In conclusion, if you have for some reason not been to Llao Llao. then please do. I did not go until recently, and only then I realised why there were usually such huge queues, even for Singapore
5
This yogurts are so freaking good that words cant describe it. Probably my favourite guilty pleasure. Variety of tastes add-ons and fruits make this combinations unlimited.
Must try in Singapore. Beware of long queues during peak hours though!
3
We saw many people with long queue. We thought that this would be extraordinary youghert. Actually it was not. Just OK...
4
It is a simple yogurt made very appealing to one's sight and taste. I like the sanum best as u cld add a variety of fruit n biscuits into yr aesthetically beautiful yogurt.
5
Best frozen yoghurt in Singapore. The texture is super creamy and its not over frozen like some of the other yoghurt places. The fruits are nice add-on. I first bought a petite cup and found it too small, the next time i bought a large cup. Not a fan with too many toppings. I am totally satisified with just the yoghurt. Love the spoon, interesting

My wife and I enjoy the yoghurt and the offerings. However, we strongly feel that each time the quality of the final offering vastly depends on the person serving you. Some staff ensure that the yoghurt is evenly spread in the tub and it is well filled. Others leave a huge empty space in the middle and just twirl the yoghurt on the inside of the tub. The result is a huge variance in the amount of yoghurt being served in each order as there is no weight measurement. This greatly leaves the enjoyment of the product to chance on who is serving you. I hope management is listening. Please train staff to not leave empty spaces in the tub . Yoghurt must be evenly filled and you need to be generous. After all it is S$ 6.95 per large helping.Change this aspect and you will tremendously improve the enjoyment of the product for me
5
The queque is super long. Worth the time tho. Ordered sanum, its really great the yogurt is tasty and a little bit bitter, i combined it with rock chocolate sauce and bitter fruit like strawberry and kiwi, adding one sweet fruit which is banana and some crumbles. Super delicious.

(This review is for Plaza Singapura location).The fruit flies hanging around the queue made the welcome a bit unappealing. Also, there were crushed fruits bits smeared all over the floor and the tables were greasy and clearly wiped but without any care. This place has run its course.Nothing special, same ol' yogurt as anywhere else, just with added hype. Red Mango or Pink Berry will give Llao Llao a run for its money.If I ever come back, it would only be to grab n go. Sorry to be so negative about this! It's just a trend that should have played out 10 years ago anyway

The distinctive lime green signboard has been sparking long lines around Singapore lately, mainly in shopping malls (for now). Similarly, whenever we spot someone holding one of these signature long, lime green plastic spoons on the streets, we immediately know what they are eating, and realise that there is a LlaoLlao outlet in the nearby vicinity.I settled for the Sanum (SGD$6.50), the tallest one that I see most people eating on the streets. For my "Crunches", I went for black chocolate-coated peanuts and dried cranberries. Fruits-wise, I had watermelon, blueberries and strawberries. As for the topping, I dutifully selected black chocolate for it. I made payment and was actually excited to receive my Llaollao sanum cup.Well, the yogurt was not bad, soft and slightly sour in taste, well obliterated by the thick chocolate sauce anyway. While I enjoyed every mouthful of velvety, stark cold sweetness and crunches, I realised that its specialty lies in the fact that it is laden with lots of ingredients, period. Strip away all the toppings - it is no different from the other frozen yogurt.For full review and more detailed information, please feel free to visit:http://thearcticstar.blogspot.sg/2015/06/yogurt-review-finally-got-to-try-much.htm

Read so much about LlaoLlao that I had to give it a try. The queues outside the Plaza Singapura branch are super long but the folks in store are so efficient that your turn comes up pretty quickly. I got the Sanum ($6.90) with almonds and chocolate Muesli as the base; strawberries, banana, & watermelon from the fruit selection; and white chocolate sauce.The yogurt itself is creamy and delicious, the white chocolate sauce was terrific. In all, I had a really good tub of frozen yogurt - will definitely go back and try other DIY combos
4
Most people in the queue ordered the sanum . I saw that it was huge and settled for the small with one choice of topping. The yoghurt was just nice , not too sweet or sour. I felt that sticking to the fruits will be better than the sweet sauces. The taste of the yoghurt could be altered
