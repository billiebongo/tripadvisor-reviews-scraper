After an evening of brisk walking along the river, we came upon this cafe at Robertson Quay. One for one pizza promotion was what attracted us and both pizzas(thin crusted) were satisfying. Perfectly paired with a bottle of Pinot Grigio. Great value!
5
Really good restaurant staff very friendly and helpful!
Delicious and abundant thanks to the chef Antonio!
4
Such a nice place to visit for quiet dinner! ✨ food was yum, pistachio tiramisu was to die for, good hospitality, felt homey, warm and relax. Will visit again in future

Made a reservation online for 2 but had a last minute addition of a third; restaurant was happy to accommodate the change. Service was top notch, wait staff friendly and polite. Food waiting time reasonable. Quality of the meal was acceptable. We ordered the caprese salad and eggplant parmigiana to share. Our main course included a seafood thin crust pizza (delicious) a black cod with mash, and the seafood ravioli. Only remark is the portions might be considered small for hungry diners.They run a 1 for 1 pizza/pasta special which makes it quite good value. Mid range prices

i went back with my family after a few years and i was surprised to find a completely new place. not only the restaurant is bigger and with a new fresh style, but also management and chef are new and they definitely know how to make a difference
5
We ordered two simple pasta dishes – both plentiful, tasty and well presented.Service was a bit hit or miss – had to search for the waitress to get a second glass of wine and for the bill at the end. This was a Sunday evening and service might have been better if they had been busier.....As happens so often in Singapore, the house white wine is a poor choice, so it’s necessary to pay a higher price to get a half-decent wine. Reds are usually OK.Our bill for 2 pasta dishes and 3 glasses of wine came to $84 including 10% service charge and 7% GST
5
We came here a few times during our Singapore stay and the food was lovely. Really fresh, homestyle Italian dishes, delivered with fantastic service. Our waiter was very cheerful and very attentive. I highly recommend the lasagne and the bruschetta, the lasagne has a real home taste to it and the bruschetta is so punchy and fresh
5
I brought my dog for a walk at Robertson Quay yesterday and chanced upon this Italian hidden gem. I always appreciate restuarants that are pet-friendly! Service staff Leah was an awesome waitress, she never lets our glasses go empty. Food was served timely and tastes great, the lava cake was yummy too. I can say that most reviews here are accurate and I will come back again! Thumbs up for Mondo Mio for the superb service and food
5
The recent reviews are all correct - the homely feel, great service, good food, very reasonable prices. From the outside, you might have the impression of a much more expensive establishment.I have been to Mondo Mio several with my family, and I find the fare very consistent in quality and service. The quality of the food is good as befits an Italian restaurant. I tried the carbonara (it's on the kid's menu, but they will do for adult-sized portions), lasagne, pizza, and they are all delicious. The price ($18-22) is not only reasonable, but cheap, considering that many cafes serving the same fare but of standard quality charges the same. The beef steak ($42) is surprisingly large, delicious, and really value-for-money.The desserts are (just) a little expensive, but worthwhile if you want to round off dinner with something sweet. For instance, Chocolate lava cake with ice-cream is $13 but very nice. If you do not want to spend too much, I suggest just ordering a main course
5
Great place for a great feed at very reasonable prices!We had the mushroom risotto, Pizza, steak and a spaghetti bog. All yummy!Couldn't fault the service or the very well priced food. Only criticism would be the costof the wine.....but then again, all wine is expensive in Singapore
5
Mondo mio pizza is amazing and the t bone steak is outstanding. Well done guys looking forward to coming back
4
It was a very good ambiance and a romantic dinner with my beloved loved one...thanks for a wonderful food and the service was impeccably divine...
5
I went yesterday to Mondo Mio and tried their famous pizza following TripAdvisor reviews. Outstanding
5
Mondo Mio Italian restaurant on Robertson Quay has got the best idea ever keep open their wonderful kitchen way after midnight
2
Was sitting down outside with a pizza and a red wine.The pizza wasn't exceptional, you can get the same pretty much everywhere around Robertson Quay. The location is good and the furniture isn't falling apart so you can't complain.Mid way in my pizza one guy had enough of the mondo and decided to empty his stomach just behind me and just about around my feet. I can't blame the pizza but I quickly lost my appetite for pizza and wine at that point.Skipped across the few dry places where this guy hadn't left his breakfast, lunch, dinner and drinks to get in to pay and get the heck out of dodge.What surprised me and the neighbour table was that the front desk staff completely ignored the fact that we paid to get out of the smell of sushi marinated in stomach acid and there's no offer of compensation what so ever.I've been around Singapore and I'm pretty sure we'd be given a compensation in most places.Summary:1. Food isn't fabulous2. If something hits the fan you still pay full price.3. I'm not coming back in a hurry.
1
BAD AND RUDE SERVICE!!!!!Terrible service, food is ok only yet expensive.But most terrible is the level of service attitude.After trying to convey feedback about our dining experience, the boss appeared offended and kept making excuses in a super condescending manner.Do not visit
5
Looking for a place to dine I chanced upon Mondo Mio, a quaint Italian restaurant divided in two sections: the Al Fresco part, along the main passage, and the air con inside. My guest & I chose the latter, where a beautiful fresco of the Canal Grande of Venezia crossed by a life size gondola stands out like an imaginary window. The Maitre D'. Massimo Aquaro, was very competent in recommending us an amazing air flown burrata, and swift in assuring that it was promptly delivered. Unobtrusive, professional and kind, Massimo suggested us choices to choose from and did inquiry on hat we could or could not eat. This kind of service, present yet not suffocating, caring but not overselling, is what made our experience enjoy the tasty cuisine of Mondo Mio. Either if you are visiting Singapore & missing Italy, or if you liv ein Singapore and enjoy Italian food, go to Mondo Mio and ask for Massimo, the soul of this gem
5
Where do go in Singapore if you still dream to have late dinner ? Mondo mio is the right spot. I was there two days go with a good friend of mine and we had our fantastis authentic italian pizza at 23:30
5
I got to Robertson Quay rather late for dinner. Mondo Mio kitchen was still open, ordered a pizza which was very good, just to make the night totally enjoyable I was able to watch a champions league match.Restaurant Manager Massimo (well known in the industry) was a great host, as always
5
Last night i landed late at changi, and after one week with local and street food around taiwan and korea (which i actually enjoyed) my stomach really needed some good pasta or pizzaI go to mondo mio quite often, the taste is very italian and the food is good, price is also good compared to the quality served, I expected to get a salad, considering the hour close to midnight, however i found out that now the kitchen is open until 1.30 AM!!This is a plus that you don’t commonly find in singapore restaurants anymoreHungry at night? You know where to go now
5
Great place , nice and quiet for lunch.
Ribeye is/was fantastic
tenderloin wrapped in parma ham, only for a limited time , fantastic
It open till late in the evenings also.
5
Wow thank you Mondo Mio for serving your good food on week ends till 1-30 in the morning. I love your steaks and pizza
5
I love Mondo Mio Italian restaurant at Robertson and they open the kitchen way after mid night. Love it
5
Evert time I am in Singapore I must pay a visit to such beautiful spot and nice restaurant. Take the rib eye
5
Mamy friend of mine road me to try Mondo Mio italian restaurant and I did. It's Amazing . Thank you guys
5
I like to go to places where the food is not just good but also convenient. Mondo mio italian restaurant offers the best on Robertson quay
5
I came to Mondo Mio Italian restaurant to find my friend Max and got surprised by the quality of burrata and the level of the wine list and service
5
We often go to Mondo Mio to indulge in some wine good food and friends. Very advisable because convenient as well
5
I followed my hubby to Mondo in order to greet mr. Max our old friend from Capricci. We were so happy with the choice
5
Every time I fell like hang out for good food in a lively are just indulge I always choose Mondo. I love the pizza and the staff is so welcoming
5
I am arrived in Singapore since May 2017 and I found Mondo Mio very comfotable and convenient. Thanks JoSpeed48 the fastest rider I know
5
I tried Mondo after reading so many reviews and I found that the t-bone is the best in town. I believe some reviewer are not sincere when they criticise such a wonderful place
5
Me and my hubby been to Mondo for bites and pre drinks. The place was so attractive that we decided to stay the whole night. Lovely
5
After reading so many review about Mondo Mio's T-bone steak charcoal grilled I gave it a try. In a single word AMAZING
5
Pizza and pasta like in Italy, everything perfect, from the service to the owner. Absolutely recommended.
2
We were hoping for a romantic dinner. We qere soooo disappointed. Some food seemed rushed and not fresh...even came not so hot. Service lacking from unfriendly girl
2
On the way to a meeting we stopped for lunch. The water was lazy and took forever to bring the menu and the place was almost empty. His expressions were of utter indifference ...no smiles.The food was of poor quality and taste...Overcooked the food. Looking at some of the reviews we noticed that immediately after a customer posts a review...the management rudely answers with a response that is very bad and not caring about the customer...then you get blasted by a series of "reviews" from "italian" experts praising the restaurant. We feel this is fake and supports what seems to be the managements cynical treatment of paying customers. What a miss...if you do not like bad service and poor quality food then stay away..so expensive for the terrible food they provide and all is supported by an arrogant management attitude
5
I'm a Italian chef and I was delighted by the really true Italian food at Mondo Mio. Friendly welcomed by Massimo, the manager, that suggested us to try their tbone steak cooked on charcoal.It was amazing. The pizza is a must try as well. I will sure come back for more
2
Came for a business lunch...two servers no manager...they were so unhospitable...the restaurant was nearly empty and the lady and man cooks could not be bothered....foid was delivered lightning quick...bad salad...worse meats and overcooked bland pasta...how can pata be served one mi ute after appetizers are cleared? Tasted premade. Niodle soft bland...everything tasted bad...we will not be coming bad...took almost ten minutes to get the indifferent waiter tobring the bill...they made a special effort to make us unhappy...and succeeded briliantl
2
Food was very average-- pizza very mediocre. Service rather slow. Ok value. Overall not awful but not really good eithe
5
Great food. Friendly, knowledgeable and helpful people. The lychee martini, the pistachio tiramisu......all were delectable!
5
Great food, great atmosphere, very comfortable and just feels like dinner cooked by mum at home for a great price. Highly recommended.
5
Best meat in Singapore by far. Actually by right it was not just a t-bone but a porter house. Charcoal cooking is so nice. Reccomended
5
Very nice place with good food and nice bar attached. I will come again when in singapore my friend raccomended
5
Guys I can't believe I never been here in 10 years in Singapore. God what a miss. Price good food is fantastic and so lively. Congrats
5
Posto ben curato con cibo di livello elevato, soddisfatto del consiglio ricevuto..... ritornerò presto.
Well cured place, high level food, happy for the received hint... I will go back to eat there again soon.
5
Authentic Italian cuisine in a warm and froendly setting. Fantastic atmosphere and a menu bursting with choices. We had a range of ishes, all of which exceeded expectations. We will be back.
5
Great atmosphere best Italian food ever. Service was to perfection as was the pizza! I felt like I was back in Italy having dinner
5
Searched and searched, on the net, for somewhere to eat around Robertson Quay and nothing grabbed me. Dining with elderly parents and decided to walk around and see what we could find. Eating early at 7ish and decided to try Mondo Mio as they were advertising a 2 for 1 deal. We had 2 pizza's and 2 pastas and a beer and lots of water and the bill came to $66. Amazing value, wonderful service and the food did the job. Thank you
5
Lat Friday night, as soon as we landed in Singapore, we headed towards a cosy and quaint entertainment district: Robertson Walk, right close to the Singapore River and much cooler than the noisy, touristy and pricey Clarke Quay.Along with my five friends (two Chinese and three Brits), we spotted a quaint Italian Restaurant, Mondo Mio, and were promptly shown to a lovely outdoor dining table by their friendly and cheerful Italian hospitality team helmed by Massimo who promptly welcomed us with a Bellini and shared with us quick information on Mondo Mio's freshest gourmet delights.We had a most enjoyable dinner in a pleasant and informal setting.Truly remarkable were the Trofie al Pesto, a thin twisted pasta from Liguria, Northern Italy.Simply outstanding was the Fiorentina-style T-bone Steak: seasoned and cooked to perfection, lean, rich and juicy!Tiramisu' dessert, an Italian classic, came along with a unique Sicilian flavour twist: pistachio nuts.Drinks came at a ridicolous price and were perfectly paired with the food by Massimo: Bellini Italian Aperitivo at the bar right before being seated, Pinot Grigio white wine with the Trofie pasta, Nero d'Avola full-bodied Sicilian red with the T-bone Steak
5
That's Italy outside Italy. The pasta and the steak I had here were so properly done. We ordered pistacchio tiramisù it was super
5
The pizza and the steak at Mondo Mio were just to die for. Very recommended. Wine list priced on the Low side. I'll come back soon
5
I come here every month when I visit Singapore, absolute favourite!
Great antipasto, reasonable wine, and awesome beer specials!
5
I am always wondering where is the best location for my business lunches. Now I have no more doubs. Mondo Mio at Robertson
5
Pizza margherita with real mozzarella on top I really like the crispy crust and fresh flavour of their tomato
5
Great authentic Pizza and great service. If it would not be so hot you would not know your in Singapore.
5
Nice to be . Great ambience. Friendly staff . Awesome food . I had burrata with Parma ham and pizza they were heavenly
5
We had a great taste experience here in a lovely setting.
The service was excellent. The signature pasta Mondo Mio was drool-worthy
and the Tiramisu to die for. A great venue foe celebrations.
5
When I feel like having my favourite pizza which is pizza diavola with anchovies I strait away go to the best in town Mondo Mio. Very good
5
We are pizza snobs (Chicago and Mystic Pizza) and we love the offerings at Mondo Mio! Top choices are Diavolo (the pepperoni rocks) Four Cheese (quatro!) and Bosciola (real Italian sausage and mushroom). Best crust in town, hands down. Burrato also is excellent there as is the specialty dessert, pistachio tira misu. All the staff and management are very attentive. Beer specials are a great value as well! If you're looking for authentic, well-priced Italian food, this is your place. Location at Robertston Quay is a fun option for hanging out with friends in Singapore. Family-friendly
5
I come to Mondo Mio every time I need to get that Italian feeling you can have only in Italy. The staff is friendly and the price is reasonable. Do not miss it
5
Great music ... cool and classy and great Italian food ... what's not to love about Mondo Mio ... good for couples and bigger groups ... can't recommend this place more !!
5
Every time I bring my guests in this restaurant it's always delivering amazing food. I highly recommend it
5
I have been there with my wife for relaxing lunch and good food and ressonable priced wines I met Max the manager and had great time with him. Will come back often
5
Great location by the river. Great place for dinner with friends and family. Ordered a pizza, it was so good we immediately ordered another. Will become a regular for us when we're in the mood for Italian!
5
Mondo mio restaurant serves good food at friendly pricing. I had rib eye steak and it was great. Nice pizza also
5
I had a very nice time bone steak at only 78 dollar. It was juicy and grilled to perfection. The wine also not pricey.
5
we had pizza, scamorza and truffle risotto. it was just right for our appetite. love the pizza. the dough was good. writing this review makes me want to go back. 😋
5
Mondo Mio restaurant is a piece of Italy on Robertson quay I like to go there for the quality of their pizza and the friendly price
5
I've tried several Italian restaurants along the river here; Mondo Mio was the one I always went back to. I loved the lasagna bolognese, spinach salad, and tiru misu. The pizza crusts were exactly as I wanted them.The wait staff were, without fail, friendly and polite. They recognized us as repeat visitors.The least likable thing about this restaurant: Their choice of music when dining indoors. For some reason, every time we dined inside, the music was Mexican street music. It wasn't unpleasant, simply not the right atmosphere for truly wonderful Italian food. I'm not going to downgrade fantastic food for a music choice
5
Pizza here is simply the best and the chili oil is home made and I grew addicted to it. Strongly raccomended
5
Every time I come to Singapore Mondo Mio is my favourite destination for dinner. The food and the service is very proper. Raccomended
5
Best pizza in Singapore and great selection of wine. Staff are very friendly and service is fast. Also located in a vibrant spot, great for a Friday night dinner
5
When I need some time for myself I go to Mondo Mio have a pizza or a pasta they are very well done. Always friends around and some nice tunes
5
I am always at Robertson quay to enjoy pizza at Mondo Mio it's the best in Singapore I believe. The price at this restaurant is very friendly. Highly recommended
5
Great place with a fantastic food. The service is also very good. I use to bring take way for my family and they love it
5
I am regularly coming to mondo Mio... I love there's food.... Chef is from south Itally...if u like pasta that is write place...specially farfalle with salmon....and I love linguine seafood a lot. Try also Mondo Mio Pizza
5
I am here 3 times a week for the pizza the music and the friends always around. Not to be missed friendly priced and comfortable. Bravi ragazzi
5
What a great find! In a city where so many places in Singapore are soooo average this place is an absolute gem- wonderful authentic Italian pizza and quality well priced drinks.
5
Located in a busy restaurant strip the Mondo Mio offers an excellent range of Italian dishes.We had the Risotto and the Signature pasta dish. Both were excellent.The ambiance outside was lovely with other restaurants nearby and people passing by.We found the wine and beer selection to be quite good and not too expensive. Service was excellent and the prices quite reasonable.It was so good we returned several nights later
5
Had lunch here with a friend on a weekday. The ambience is comfortable and they serve up a great margarita pizza!!!
4
We went for Mothers Day and had a lovely meal. The food was nice, staff attentive and a lovely spot for us to be together. Kids Meals offered were a great variety with reasonable prices.
4
Perfect for weekdays dinner and drinks. Good selection of wines. Alfresco as well as indoors dining. Good for Small gatherings and family. In Picture was Seafood in foil. One of my fav! Al Dante.
4
Food was great although both the pizza and pasta were a little too salty for my liking. The ambience was good too!
5
I had few days ago a casual lunch with my girlfriend and tried Pizza, Scamorza and Risotto. It is my best italian food of 2017 and I ll go there again and again. The peole are friendly and the service is 5 stars. Do not miss this place if you are in Singapore. Ciao Michel
4
We had a family dinner for a Grandson's 7th birthday this year. The staff could not have been kinder to the young fellow and his brother. The food we ordered was excellent and the wait staff attended to our every requirement. We have previously eaten at this restuarant in November 2016 and the food and staff attention was of the same high standard
5
Saturday night dinner outside, the atmosphere was nice and while there were plenty of people around, it didn't feel crowded like other places in Singapore. The menu was good with prices reasonable and tge service was timely. The pizza, pasta and dessert options were all quality. It's also nice to not have to fall back on Heineken, Carlsberg or Tiger and enjoy a refreshing Peroni.
3
The started was nice as all the food. For family's with kids perfect have a kids menu in a reasonable quantity of food. Staff nice and always there for help. Lava cake desert really nice can be shared . Recommend from the price to the food . Families will enjoy.
3
In the heart of small Quay village with plenty of other options, it looks like the kinda place where you might get a break from local food and have some really good Italian...but somehow it is a little disappointing.The menu sounds good, but the food does not taste fresh, garlic bread is a little soggy for example and not really "toast" like, and the pasta, considering it is supposed to be "home prepared" is not even comparable to a decent Barilla pack....Look around...
4
We have been visiting Modo Mio for many years now, and each time the food and service is reliable and authentic. The pasta and pizza are always delicious and the salads fresh and tasty.If I have one complaint, it is that the outdoor areas allow smoking. I appreciate that this is allowed in Singapore, but for many this spoils the experience considerably
4
Have been coming to this restaurant for 10+ years. The lunchtime set menu is good value. The pizza here is great and the pasta is good as well. There is indoor air conditioned seating and more casual outdoor seating.
5
Was there for dinner last night! Had wine and few starters and lamb rack. Gorgeous simple Italian food.
And most importantly great service.
Thank you Mondo Mio service & kitchen team
Keep up the good work!
3
Stopped in for lunch with a friend, nice pizza and wine. Average prices for Singapore, but still pretty high compared to other cities. Friendly staff, thanks
5
Finally a restaurant good enough to be called Italian. Pizza is very good and you can find a variety of delicious dishes prepared by real Italian chefs. When I come to Singapore I go there very often, especially on Wednesdays when there is live music
5
We had several very nice meals in this restaurant in Robertson's Quay. Particularly enjoyed the Lasagne. Very friendly staff who recognised us the second time we went there.
5
Exquisite real oven baked pizzas, delicious pastas and delightful tasty desserts. Special mention for the chocolate lava cake! Italian owner & wife are very pleased to welcome anyone. Feel at ease, feel at home!
A bit of Italian taste in the middle of Far East
4
Eateries at Robertson Quay are expensive. Mondo Mio we found was very reasonably priced. so we chose this place. But, after having the meal, I can tell you that it was very good quality food and was value for money.Very conveniently located in the middle of Robertson Walk and right next to 7 Eleven store, Mondo Mio offers no fancy decor or view. I guess their focus is more on the quality of food.I went with my wife and 2 daughters. We ordered prawns for starters, lasagne and a meat dish. All the dishes were good in quantity and tasty. On a suggestion for a wine, they offered a Merlot red wine which was excellent.We had a great time and a very satisfying meal @ Mondo Mi
5
I went there two time with a collegue. I m italian and finally i found a place that sadisfied me as italian food. Pizza was great but also cake and pasta very very close to my own country. The staff is very care and nice .. they don t press you but at the same time they follow you. I ll go there for sure other time
5
I've eaten at Mondo Mio several times now and have not been disappointed. Excellent pizza (try the 4 cheese), pasta (try the tagliatelle della casa---rich n creamy) and gnocchi. Matt the manager is attentive to all your needs. And excellent house wine for only $8 a glass. Not to mention an awesome fidelity card---every 5 glasses of wine gets you one free
5
The food in Mondo Mio Singapore was absolutely amazing! delicious and authentic flavors from Sicily, even the saldad was fabulousI have been in Sicily before and have to say the food of the Chef Antonio is like being back in the island, top quality products and top quality taste! Would recommend it very much.The Chef Antonio is a very friendly man and it was a pleasure talking to him
5
We enjoyed an excellent meal here recently to celebrate my husband's birthday at the end of a tour. The food was freshly prepared and very good. Service was excellent, highly recommended
5
Went with friends and had a great meal which was a suggestion by the big boss. The service and wine was excellent as well. It was great sitting outside as it wasn't too hot or humid.
5
Mondo Mio has been consistently serving good Italian cuisine at Robertson Quay for 10 years now. They've doubled in size since I first went there in 2007, but prices are still as reasonable as when they started. Recommended.
3
Food was ok. Something that fills u up when ur hungry. The outdoor space was too dark though but overall it's decent food.
5
I had mixed feelings when I sat down at this restaurant for a family dinner. Was it going to be another overpriced and underwhelming experience? Thankfully it wasn't. Delicious gnocchi and pasta. Lovely staff too. Highly recommended.
3
I love the ambience / setting on the interiors of the restaurant, cosy and romantic. We had a hard time communicating and understanding the server's explanation of the how the happy hour menu works. While waiting for our orders, no bread with olive oil & balsamic vinaigrette were served. When our orders arrived, we were disappointed the food portions were small. The prawns were not fresh. As foodies, we have tasted better Italian food and with bigger portions for the similar price.
5
Mondo mio is a great restourant that i have been for Dinner wt a friend .we always have a friendly staff who serve us for a special treat as guests.the food is really fresh and i feel like at home... the environment is pleasant and the location is great.. thanks and see you soo
4
Went there twice during our 3 weeks stay at Park Hotel Clarke Quay. Food are delicious except for lasagnia, portion is too huge & I've tasted better somewhere else.We enjoyed their dessert very much. Canoli, pistachio tiramisu & molten lava cake... These are to die for! Service are exceptional. Can't comment about price as everything in this area are expensive
5
I was staying here in Singapore few months from now, and it was a lovely experienced the best thing was i was looking for a great food. Then on my off day I was walking around Clarke Quay and saw there were many restaurants. I was hungry and searching for a nice place to sit and dine. Then I came to this italian restaurant Monde Mio. I did order pizza..I haven't taste that pizza before.. And later the deserts. I felt complete and return to my house satisfied of what I paid. Monde Mio make my tummy full with awesome food they served and service is the best thing i loved.
3
I was actually impressed at first that Mondo Mio boasted that they are celebrating their 10th anniversary in Singapore. Authentic Italian food is not easy to come by and claimed.Food was okay but it wasn't as authentic as I thought it would be - cooked by Italians as claimed. But definitely a good place for friends and family
3
Great location, friendly staff, food was very good, fresh and quickly served. Good selection of wine, not cheap but as expected for the area. Would go again. Pizzas delicious!
5
There are so many restaurants to choose from in Robertson Quay - which is fantastic although makes choosing a little difficult as you always wonder have I chosen the right one? Mundo Mia was definitely the right choice.My eldest daughter wanted pasta although we had booked Mexican. Unfortunately the Mexican we had booked had run out of the happy hour white and could not offer my youngest chilli (which I appreciate is an American dish but if always appears on Mexican menus in some form of other) and in fact the Indian waiter did not even know what it was - it did not bode well so we left in search of pasta. The food was very good at Mundo Mio. We had the black squid pasta, gnocchi with pumpkin, lasagna and spag Bol for the youngest and it was all delicious. Even the happy hour wine was good. Puddings were chocolate lava cake and pistachio. Tiramisu - also very good.Great meal and attentive service so thoroughly recommend
1
A few hours before arriving we reserved, wanting to make sure the restaurant would be open and operational at 00:00 for the Italy-Spain game. I called, spoke to a woman who knew English, was very clear. She said they would definitely be open and even asked me for my number. When we arrived at 23:00, the restaurant was closed! Of course, anything could have happened. But they had my number (a local one) and honestly could have called. Unprofessional.
5
It was our second time here and still finding the place and food very nice. The pasta and pizza have a lot of selections. The service is very good even though the team could be shorthanded. This is really a great place to have Italian food. It is not the usual pizza and pasta that are available in common restaurants. The proportion of the pasta is good for 1 or can be shared if you order another pizza. Their pizza has a thin crust and is very nice. The choco lava for dessert is very sumptuous to complete your meal. There is an option to dine inside or outside the restaurant
5
We called for first time tonight whilst on holiday welcoming staff very cool inside romantic settings had the fillet steak which was cooked to perfection! And reasonably priced. We thoroughly enjoyed the ambience of the place staff were not pushy just attentive and lovely. We hope to visit again for Italian meal before end of holiday! Look out for this restaurant it's a must for all ages Lynda & Alan u
5
It may as well have been in Rome, Naples or Milan, this place is that good! Attentive staff, great prices and simply fantastic food make this place the perfect starter before heading to the ridiculously priced Quay restaurants. The fact that Expat Living don't show this place on their website shows how insular their lives are. Get a life. Get a job and enjoy a real treat in Singapore.Shame on you all for not knowing this plac
4
Nice location to have a lunch or dinner meal. Great service and the food was excellent so no complaints. My pizza was very good. Almost as good as having one in Italy. Prices were reasonable given you are in Singapore. Its just around the corner forom Rosso Vino which is another italiian restaurant we ate at and I would say the food and pricing is pretty comparaible between the two. Just make sure you eat early if you wish to keep your drinks bill down as drinks are quite expensiuve after happy hour has finished
5
We have been coming to this restaurant for the last 7 years. We have always received excellent service and the food is high quality. The ambience is great being able to sit outside and people watch with the fans keeping us cool, and the recent addition of awnings has meant we can stay outside during the regular downpours. We stick with the pizza and pasta as we have found this is their specialty and tends to be better quality than the food from the grill section.
4
The restaurant is just off Robertson Quay in the Clark Key area The staff is good, the food ample and price very fair if you think you are in Singapore. I love to sit outside and see the people walking by and the nightlife in the nearby cafes and bars. Food is great... had several appetizers, pastas and pizzas and they were all very good - I love the linguini, cooked perfectly and reasonably priced. They serve draft beer and wine by the glass if you like. Zayd is a very attentive and helpful manager.
1
The worst possible service I have ever had in a restaurant. I had to wait 45 mins for my main course to arrive after I had my starter. Customers who came after, not one but two all had their meals served whilst I was waiting patiently. Surely your staff could see that my table was empty and I had been without food for a considerable length of time? I ordered one of the most basic of Italian pasta dishes in the hopes it would arrive early. I most certainly will not be eating here again. I also like to mention I was the only dark skinned customer at the restaurant tonight. Could this have led to the poor service, one does begin to wonder when you are the only one in the restaurant
3
Enjoy the place, location on Robertson quay is great. Manager was very friendly and attentive. The food is ok, i was expected a better pasta. My wife enjoyed her dinner.
2
I ordered Mediterranean pizza. There was tuna inside and it was too salty. I could not eat. And I order a vegetarian pizza which they suggested. I could not eat either.
I don't suggest anyone to come and have pizza here. I am still hungry....

The food was ok, i had a risotto with mushrooms, which was good and the price was not expensive, the restaurant was empty, but the service was not very good.

This wonderful restaurant is just off Robertson Quay in the Harbor area in Singapore. The staff is good, the food ample and price worthy for an expensive foodie city. The air conditioning is a great relief from the constant heat and humidity outside. I particularly enjoyed the linguini with crab, cooked perfectly and reasonably priced. I was told that this restaurant is Japan based, but here there were no Japanese noted in the staff

Very bad experience in this place! I had dinner alone, had a sit on my table and they bring me the menu.. up to here all ok. They make me wait 20 minutes without asking if I was ready to order, and then they took the order when I called them.. tired of waiting.I ordered soup of the day as appetizer, and fish of the day as main, and a coke. easy right?10 minutes after they bring the coke.. other 25 minutes after they bring me the main. I informed the waiter that I ordered an appetizer and she answer me: "What you want me to do, cancel it?"... I was shocked! not even apologizing and she was very rude, attitude wise.I tried this place, and I will never go back here! The not interest in taking care of the clients from the waiters staff, the arrogance of the people make me decide that it's not worth it my money! It also explained why was half empty compared to the others restaurants around!Bad bad experience!

2 families with kids had dinner at this eatery. Simple rustic Italian charm. The kids had lasagna and pizza while I had the beef tenderloin. It was really tasty and goes along well with the house red wine. Quality of food is good but prices are not exactly cheap. I like the ambience and the open kitchen concept

Not much of a first impression and expectation for dinner at this basic family restaurant with a somewhat tacky decor, but was bowled over by the quality of their food. This is also one of the few Italian restaurants in town that serve delicious calzones. Their prices are also a lot more reasonable than most of the other restaurants in the charming Robertson Walk enclave

A great little place on Robertson Quay.Not as in-your-face and populated as many of the other venues in this area... but this is not because the food or service are of lesser quality. On the contrary.Food is great... had several appetizers, pastas and pizzas and they were all outstanding. The chef is Italian (I think... I saw him talking to Italian customers in Italian). Wines are excellent and affordable.Service is great... efficient, efficient, efficient and still friendly.I have been coming back to this place for years... and will certainly keep on doing so

I love risotto .. I tried every one in every decent restaurant when I was in SG.. and this place had by far the creamiest richest yet not too heavy and just down right heavenly mushroom risotto! Shame I didnt have time to go back for another before I left.

We had the pizza, it was great, I like thin crust. The price was reasonable, the service was good and the area is great. This area really gets busy in the evening, lots of expats. One of the more reasonably priced in this area. Great for an after or before dinner walk along the river, or grab a boat ride on the river

Food served was non tasty. We feared we may get stomach sick, but were lucky. Expensive fare. Server didn't know what to recommend. Wasted evening....

Mondo Mio make tasty pizza and pastas and has a great location at Roberston Quay. Service is good as well. Great for a quick dinner date or a meal with the family.

We had the set lunch at Mondo mio,..the waiter was very helpful,I had the salmon which was so juicy and the vegetables were fresh,my boyfriend had the pasta , good food,good service,very enjoyable,will recommend

This was my second time at this restaurant, Very good italian food, specially the tomato sauce they use is excellent. Pizzas are not too thin but excellent quality.
5
The food is fresh, tasty and authentic. The manager as well as the staff are just here to please you. I enjoy every visit.

My mum with dementia loves this place -- she can remember that she wants to come back here despite her dementia and the staff here are lovely and patient with us. Great pizza, pasta, soup, dessert and love the set lunch!

not to many places in singapore offer good Pizza and mondo mil is definitely one of them.
The place is nice, and the staff is very friendly and helpful. The wine however is not that great and this is definitely a point to improve.

We had a great meal here..fast attentive service.both had pasta meals and a garlic bread along with a draught beer $70.. nice walk along the river and the other shops. It was monday night so looked a little quiet but absolutely no complaints. I would recommend
3
The prices are reasonable and you get what you pay for. The food is not outstanding here, but it fits the price - so I think that is fair. We started with melon e prosciutto, this was the highlight of the meal. Next came tagliatelle and tomato based sauce - the pasta looked much too wide to be tagliatelle and the sauce was uninspiring. The primavera pizza was just okay - the toppings were fresh - but the crust was a little too thick for my liking. The staff were attentive and efficient, but a little distant - they did give us a nice table by the window
2
The food was Nice, its a little dark as there is only 1 candle on the table. surrounding was fine But the Male Waiter or Manager(I Think) was a little bit stuck up. Its not that we would want a special serve by him but he gave us that look as if he don't entertain locals but only to foreigners. Was a little bit disappointed with him. Will not come back if the service continue to be that way
4
Nice romantic place, good for couple. Nice wine, good food.
Price is expensive but it worth your money

Used this restaurant twice in the last week whilst visiting family, once just with my wife and once with her family. Had a lovely meal both times, service was very good and prices were reasonable for Singapore.
Can definitely recommend the ravioli.
3
Tried this restaurant in the Robinson Quay area. The service and food was good. Would like to see more variety to the menu though - no chicken dishes on the menu.
5
The Mio Special pizza is incredible, I've eaten here three times and had consistently good food. The head waiter is friendly and welcoming , the staff are good , although we were encouraged to leave once when the place was closing.   Highly recommended based on the pizzas and coffee.
5
Of the several Italian restaurants in Robertson Quay this is stand out the best. The pizzas are beautifully made - even an Italian would like them. The pastas are all really yum. spinach and ricotta ravioli exceptional. Reasonable wine list and kid friendly - as all Italian restaurants must be

The 4 cheese gnocchi was tasteless, swimming in cream and very light on any stronger cheeses. The kids meals came 20 minutes after the adults (if you have kids you know that is not a peaceful time) despite asking for them to be served first. The service, when available, was average. And the price- far too high for what you get. All up, I would recommend any of the other Italian restaurants in the area before this one. Disappointing.

Location of this restaurant is convenience for us to catch a performance in the near by DBC Art Centre, but that is about all that we get this evening. We sit in the outdoor area comfortably watching all the passers by in a great ambience. We ordered their special pasta: linguine granchio (crab linguine S$25) and pappardelle (broad flat pasta S$28), the menu describes them as homemade pasta with some fancy ingredients. The dishes took about 20 minutes to arrive, service is invisible. Both our pasta's dressing looked and tasted similar :no garnishing, no topping, no aroma, just tomatoes sauce - Probably one of the most unappetising pasta I have seen in an Italian resturant of this price range in Singapore. My crab linguine tasted like microwavable dinner, with lots of broken crab shells and miserable strands of 'crab' dissolved in the sauce. My partner finished his with lots of tobacco sauce (it helps) ! With a 500 ml of house wine the bill came up to S$44 per head. If I want a pasta that taste like this, I would go to a fast food join

Just found by chance while was walking around and I came back few times after that... Good Pizza, Good Pasta e quite friendly staff. Price a little high maybe but at the end in Singapore (officially the most expensive city in the world at the moment) you can not complain too much..
5
We are regulars here with my mum who has dementia and is wheelchair bound, and despite her poor memory, she is always asking to return. The staff are prompt and accommodate my mum's sometimes unusual requests (and they remember them too!). Very wheelchair accessible (2 carparks nearby, all accessible), also very kid-friendly (my toddler loves the pasta), near the river too, which is great for bringing the kids to run around before / after the meal. The pizza and pasta is great -- I am always hearing some italian accents among the customers, and think that says a lot

Went here with my girlfriend, food was good. On the downside starters werent brought out together and then the mains were brought out while we were only half way through the starters. Dined at the wine connection facing this place the night after much better experience, had a very similar meal and an extra bottle of wine and cost 60s$ less
5
when i stay in the M-Hotel i love to go to the mondo mio. the food is awesom, the staff very friendly and the restaurant very nice...
my favs are the pizzas, salads and the pastas...
you cant go wrong with the mondo mio!

Very disappointing meal and service. My wife's entree was served some 15-20 minutes after mine arrived and although I'd ordered the Tagliatelle Arrabiata, which a very spicy dish, some different pasta turned-up with the most bland Arrabiata sauce. It wasn't cheap either. I'd give this place a miss and move onto the more interesting restaurants lining the Singapore River at Boat Quay
4
We were promptly greeted when we arrived and showed to our table having been given a choice as to where we would like to sit.There is a reasonable selection to choose from on the menu of this restaurant and the food is not unreasonably priced. The bill, excluding drinks was $60 for 2 mains, a shared garlic bread starter and one tiramisu pudding. The food was tasty and nicely cooked. Service was ok, but they made the basic error of bringing the main course before we had finished the starter

Felt like we were really stung at Mondo Mio. Paid $38 for a piece of fish and a handful of roast veg. $5 for four tiny pieces of garlic bread. That might be okay in a place with great service and an outstanding experience. We didn't get that here. Service was cold and basic.We had three fantastic meals for four further down Robertson Quay for the price of one at Mondo Mio
4
and this price sounds good, considering the central location. I always go there for a focaccia; I tried the pizza and pasta that are very good. Unfortunately the wine is not so convenient, a little bit pricy considering the quality. Very crowded on Friday and Sat, so the service could be slower, but abs perfect on the other days

Bottom Line- Stay away from this place!The food was horrible. The pasta was the quality of a frozen microwavable dinner. The garlic bread for the table took 45 minutes to come out and when it did it was a HUGE disappointment. First, the basket of garlic bread was for the table (four adults), when the basket arrived, it was smaller than my hand (I am average size woman) and contained four slices of garlic bread that were the size of croutons. When we flagged down a waiter to ask if we had received the proper basket, he informed us that we had received the correct basket.The service was just as horrible. As we ordered dinner, my colleague asked the waitress how a dish was prepared, she said she would check with the kitchen and report back. She NEVER came back! She put in the order and didn't even come back to deliver the food. We were never asked if we wanted our beverages refreshed and I had find the waitress when we were ready for the check.All in all it was a HORRIBLE experience..

Well, I don't really write much restaurant review but just wanna share this with you guys.... During my last night stay at Studio M Hotel, after going through those Italian restaurants review @ Robertson Quay, I decided to give a try at Mondo Mio....This dish supposedly be tomato paste but I asked to change it to cream base.... The taste was pretty good, what I don't understand is the meaning of "pieces of fish" in the description... It said squid ink pasta served with shrimps, clams and pieces of fish... I just wanna show you guys (check out the pic) what they mean by "pieces of fish".... but I think it might be much more suitable if they change it to "mince fish or tiny pieces of fish".... Or, does that really how the fish pieces should looks like in an Italian pasta? I don't know... :

Ordered 2 dishes, both "prawns" with spaghetti. Dishes came with 2 prawns each! They are advertising (putting dishes on the menu) showing "prawns" in the plural, but be warned, its window dressing only!! There are so many great places around Robertson Quay, there is absolutely no need to waste an evening out at this place. Spoke to the manager about our "2 prawns" each, and he couldn't have cared less, "can I offer you a complimentary coffee" - like we chose to spend our evening on a meal that barely passed the 'trades description act' to get a "free" coffee?!??! They clearly don't get it - you can't serve food that just passes the description on the menu and expect to do well in this area - there is simply too much choice. Maybe this is why there weren't too many people in this restaurant when there was in others! Anyway, don't bother with this place, or the completely clueless 'manager', and go somewhere else!!

Went to Mondo Mio last night for a dinner. They were quite busy as it was a Friday evening and also a week after the Lunar New Year. Siti and her Manager were on duty and they got us seated (inside) within 10 minutes. We were with a colleague from Thailand so Siti managed to explain the menu and help her with a selection for an appetiser and a main. All good. The various courses arrived and all was good - as usual. Prices are a little on the high side and the atmosphere does not lend itself to formal dining or for large groups

I used to like this little Italian restaurant quite a lot, especially because I live in the same building in Singapore. Unfortunately, the last few visits have been a disappointment, and going downhill. The meat quality isn't good, the pasta sauces don't taste right ... Dont' know what it is, but I miss the Mondo Mio of four years ago
