Went there and found out they were shifting out. Thus there was a great promotion of a free bottle of wine for min $30 spend. So so good deal!

the food was great and unique. The flavors of the food was amazing. The atmosphere is interesting. The only negative thing is that the main courses are a little too small in portion.

I have visited before and it was sensational.
This visit, despite looking online and booking through chope, there was no mention of the full menu not being run on Sundays.

Very disappointed. Overall a good place before the receipt. Menu charged 10$ on an heineken, 12$ on the receipt without gst and service charge. Enjoy your night before the bill!

Beautifully designed
Amazing cocktails
Great nibbles
Beautiful Music, one album at a time
Must visit

Turned up for my dinner booking on Saturday night and the placed has closed. Piss poor service that nobody bothered to contact me to tell me they had closed. About 4 couples waiting outside 8pm Saturday night wondering what was going on. Have emailed and called their sister restaurant and still nobody has replied

Longplay will be changing their menu In May. They will focus more on Japanese infused tapas menus and their previous wine Happy hours are also taken away as per the waiter explanation. The current menu food was good and worth exploring! Will visit again for the cool and unique interior of the place

Didn't really expect much when I first entered the restaurant. It was very much a bar/pub set up. It was a Sunday and the place wasn't busy. Tables were not set up for a proper dinner. More a bar/pub. But I was surprised by the food and service. We had the crispy squid, sliders and hotdog. Yummy. Don't expect a proper dinner outfit but you will be surprised by what they have to offer if you keep an open min

A disappointing return to Longplay. Went back to see if they had the amazing lambshank again but not on the menu .. which is fine .. looked forward to something new and amazing.Problems started when they didn't have the listed wine on the menu, something waiter should advise in advance, and when trying to discuss it the waiter just walked away.THREE TIMES trying to ask the waiter some questions he just plainly walked away and ignored us .. . so rude and inattentive . . My dinner partner ordered a Coke. It was flat. After finally getting to talk to the waiter, he wasn't really understanding then we cancelled the coke and asked for Mojito.Then a new coke with can turned up anyway. Then the mojito. And the second coke was also not that fizzy and tasted flat as if it were old or left to heat in the sun.... not really acceptable for a $6 coke.We also asked for sparkling, then still water as advertised on the menu. We were advised also not in stock. Ultimately we ordered the beef sliders. The bread was stale.Ordered the Entrada skirt steak which was fine, though over powering in flavour for some people. $30 is a hefty price for a small piece of steak, advertised as 200gm but was closer to 125g from the look.Anyway, unfortunately the waiter walking away and ignoring customer will mean I will not go back again - combined with the food unfortunately not being up to par

Went here tonight with a couple of friends. Had three of the worst, overpriced cocktails ever. Don't like the 20 bucks surcharge, plus watered down cocktails. I suspect they have read too many of their good reviews and have decided to cash in on their former reputation. Bearing in mind where they are, every other bar on the street is better. You have been warned
4
The food is surprisingly good! We thought this might be more of a bar given the vibe of the location but was pleasantly surprised.

Longplay has a policy where the minimum spend is $200 on Friday and Saturday nights if you'd like a booth seat, so we got allocated bar seats. That would be fine if you're there just for drinks, but if you'll be there long, and you're carrying a bag with you, it isn't the most comfortable setting to be in.We had the beef brisket sliders and ceviche. We really liked the ceviche, but we found the beef to be a tad too salty. The portions are really small too, for the price. We also had 2 cocktails each, which again I felt was a bit pricey for the size of the cocktails. They tasted great though. Probably would only visit again if I had a group of 4 at least, so we can hit the minimum spend of $200 and get the booth seats.

We visited LongPlay based on recommendation from our friends. Our cocktails, Pisco Sour and Inka Juice, were very well prepared and really authentical like in Peru.The food from starter to main course was excellent, we were very positively surprised. We can highly recommend the mini burgers, the steak and the quinoa jalapeños.On top the place has a very special ambiance with its decor and music.Can recommend to visit LongPlay
3
We used the entertainer app, otherwise, would have felt that food was slightly overpriced for its portion.Decor and ambiance was nice, except that they kept trying to clear our plates even though we weren't done eating. The restaurant doesn't serve water but they gave the diners some after a while anyway. that was good
4
Have been there a few times now. Cool place with an excellent vibe and staff with good attitude and service ! Food is peruvian and great value. Fish taco is a must try ! A nice pub with vinyl LPs. If you like a pub with great music, nice bites and good service don't go too far. Long Play is your here to play for you

We would never have found this place if it hadn't been for a friend who lives in Singapore. Situated in the Arab street area it looks more like a bar than a restaurant. Quirky but what a wonderful atmosphere. They play some great music from an enormous vinyl collection - blues, funk, soul - in fact, you request it they'll play it. And the food? With a real South American influence four of us shared a selection of small plates and wow! what terrific tastes and flavours, every dish to die for! - meat, fish, vegetable, seafood - all prepared right in front of us. What a find! - highly recommended. We must go back there

The tribe, consisting of Mom, Dad & Son visited Longplay last week, courtesy of a failed attempt to make a reservation at a celebrity chefs establishment at Marina Bay.It was an inspired choice (My son has an innate ability to sniff out unusual eating establishments).Longplay is a small restaurant near the Arab street area in Singapore. We were advised before our arrival that the "booths" were full, and thus we would be sitting at the counter in the rear overlooking the kitchen. Best experience I have had for a long time ... watching the Chefs manage the incoming orders and dispatching. The big advantage for us was .... We could witness the various "Pintxos" plates being assembled and then served .... in our case directly onto the counter in front of us.Ordered the Falafel, Lamb, Pork belly and the Fish Tacos plates. Each an individual culinary wonder. Finished with the Grapefruit Creme Brûlée. ( I am going back just for that.)If you like Pintxos type meals, beautifully prepared, get down there.I will be playing this one again, soon

Walking in my first impression was that we were going to have dinner in the lobby of a small hotel rather than in a 'restaurant', so was a little concerned whether we would have much of a dining 'experience'. But my fears were for nothing as the whole experience was pleasantly relaxed and very good.We tried some smaller plates and all the food was to a high standard, well presented and tasty. The service was prompt and polite; we felt well looked after, and we had some nice wine and cocktails too
4
We decided to test with my wife a new experience at the last minutes et discovered LongPlay, a bar and restaurant in the Arab street neighborhood. Nice cosy atmosphere with the feeling to go back in time in a trip to South America. The music and vinyl collection adds to the atmosphere. Food is very good with fusion of South American dishes. We recommend the Lomo Saltado and seed crackers. Service has been good, with attention and nice recommendations. A place go go again in couple or with few friends.
5
Not been reviewing much recently, coz I'm so bloody busy with work, but this place certainly merits my effort. I may be a little biased, as my old chum Rajiv is in charge of all things alcoholic here, but the food was delicious. I wasn't particularly hungry, so settled for the chef's recommendation of the Red Snapper Ceviche, and it was superb. Prepared right in front of me, with just the right amount of heat. I suspect this place gets really busy, so get there early to avoid the crowds. Top tunes from the deck man too

Went on a Friday night with my Husband. Really good happy hour till 8 pm --- $8 wines and beers. Food was fantastic, we got the duck confit and steak. Will be back in a couple weeks
5
Food is great, but service needs to improve. We were seated for about 20 minutes and the waiter didn't give us menu. Just very hard to get staff's attention at this place.
1
The one dish that finally arrived was as always amazing. The other that we ordered 3 times, well we will never know..., 2 hours to be served 1 dish and 2 drinks, ( and even getting the wine proved difficult) and when we gave up trying to eat and asked for the bill it was like we were in a parallel universe..., if only we had eaten what we were being asked to pay for. Maybe it's all in the name...Longplay. Been before had a fantastic evening, last night Longplay you were just deeply frustrating

My husband and I dined at Longplay a few weeks ago and were both pleasantly surprised with the experience. We were unsure what to expect food-wise from what seems more of a bar than a restaurant, with quite a small menu, but are glad we took the chance to try it out. The atmosphere is really interesting and a bit quirky, with somewhat strange seating for dining and a great selection of music being played throughout the evening. The highlight for us though was the fabulous food! Everything we ate was excellent. The pork belly snack that we shared was crispy and the garnish a flavourful addition to the dish. My main course of sweet potato gnocchi was lovely, the gnocchi were tender and fluffy as they should be and the chocolate mousse dessert was rich and satisfying. The highlight for me though, and for my husband as well who got a little taste, was the quail ballotine that I had as a starter. It was a truly exceptional dish, perfectly balanced and full of flavour, with perfectly cooked and fork-tender quail. We both agreed that it was one of the best dishes we've had in a restaurant. The service as well was great, our waiter was very warm and welcoming, and also very knowledgeable about the menu and dishes on offer. Overall a fantastic experience and since they change the menu regularly we're looking forward to a return visit to try some more dishes

The stuffed squid, prawn & barley risotto, and the steak were all excellent. Well cooked and good flavours. If I had one complaint, it would be that given its a fairly small menu of about maybe 10-15 mains, pea hummus still managed to make an appearance as an element of both the squid and risotto dishes. Also, the two cocktails I tried were meh and just okay respectively. And the music could be a bit loud for conversation, depending on where you sit. (okay that was more than one complaint - but the food is still worth going for!

We went here after having a boring experience in another bar in Haji lane. So we went here after reading reviews about it. The place looks really good, love the ambiance and the furniture! We had 4 cocktails and they were all amazing! We also ordered the avo chicken tacos which was really good but we were blown away with the red snapper ceviche, thanks to David for his awesome recommendation! All these while enjoying the music and the service, we were really happy finding this bar/restaurant! My fiance hasn't stopped talking highly about this place (which is rare)!Overall if you want to have excellent food, great drinks, and amazing music (they have crazy amount of vinyl selection!), this is the place to be! Totally recommended, especially if you are a big jazz fan! Will definitely come back on our next trip to Singapore
4
Ambience was promising, food was excellent - in fact the lamb shank was exceptional. Wine selection a little disappointing on the white side if you're not a fan of Chardonnay however the waiter found a non-menu bottle behind the bar which was acceptable.Unfortunately the service was a bit lacking, with wait staff focused more on their phones, the music/records, and sticking with the bar patrons rather than serving guests in the dining area. Improve the service, watch the music volumes and i'll be back !
5
Food is excellent - it's a South American theme and you can tell there is so much thought & love that goes into the cooking.The ambience is also lovely - they play vinyl records and the last time I went was 'Jazz night'The service is also great - David, is really attentive and knowledgable about the food, and genuinely cares about his customers.A great find, i've been twice in four days so will be going again soon!
5
We have been recommended to come here by another restaurant. When I stepped inside, I didn't like the atmosphere as music was too loud for me. The waiter was so nice to find a table at the rear, away from loud speaker.Food was 5 stars, especially barley prawn risotto, pan seared stingray.Anyway, at the end of the night, I love the music and staff here. They are great people, served with a smile.Thx for having us here tonight
4
Now been to LongPlay twice. Super impressed after first visit and would have given a 5. Second visit appears to have been an anomaly. All the music was fantastic the first night, second visit was like the picked British rock "B" sides to play. Spotify couldn't identify some of it. Happy hour pork tacos were fantastic. Will go again.
4
A good place to catch up with friends. The volume of the music doesn't drown the conversations you're having with your companions, which is great. Service is fantastic.
5
We've been to Longplay on two occasions now, and both times the food has been amazing, the service wonderful and the music fabulous. David is knowledgeable about his food, wine and music! Absolutely love it!
4
Really cool bar with vinyl records and do spinning great vinyls great place to chat with friends or a first date wirh drink and finger food
4
We love Haji lane and Longplay is one of those cool hangouts that fits the general vibe of the surrounds. Small but excellent menu and great music playing. Great Negroni cocktail. Go along and chill out!
5
Great night out, interesting to watch the chefs at work n love the vinyls and decor of the restaurant.

The sound of music playing off the vinyl has always been an attraction to me at Long Play. With the dim lights...little corners with low tables & lounging chairs, it feels like a living room with a bit of luxe which I would have had.I first started coming to Long Play when they opened as a bar. And I was very charmed by its atmosphere. Just when I thought the seats facing the wall were weird, over time I have appreciated them to be great seats where I will have conversations with my close friend.Now I am back here for the first time since they started their food offering. Though a small intimate menu, but I was impressed by the dishes that were coming out of this small open kitchen that is looking a bit make shift. 4 mains...3 starters.....& 6 drinks later. We were happy......& still happy.It's BYOV (Bring Your Own Vinyl) every Sunday!! So come with some of your favorites or an old school collection from your parents. I always love a 70's disco track
5
Found this place by accident and ended up eating and drinking there on the last two nights of our holiday. The food and cocktails are fantastic and loved seeing the chefs working on the other side of the bar. It was quiet on our last night and we got to make some music requests which were found in the 2000 plus collection of vinyl. Can't praise this place enough.

We were there for drinks after our early dinner. We sat by the bar and saw they cooking food right on the spot (open kitchen). Lady who's in charge of cooking using her bear hand grabbed everything in example raw meat, veggie, frozen fries etc. Then after cook the same hands put fries on the bowl. Menu really got me interested. But after watched she doing that and also using her back hand to wipe off her swet on face multiple times. Never wash hands for the whole time I was there. So,my idea to try the food here is gone. Drink : Cocktail we order 2 from the menu both were good. On pick main ingredient and left the rest to the bartender turned out not so good. So, recommended to order from menu only. At the end I found one of his goatee hair on my drink too. Paid and leave after that. So poor in hygiene here!!!
5
The drinks ambience and food were all great. David was very friendly and knew his menu well. The Chilean chef and Chef Treize Zhou did amazing job in their simple menu. Creviche and pork were really good. The young girl is service was very pleasant and hospitable
4
Amazing food, with wonderful cocktail. Music is very nice and cosy but a bit too loud, no need for that. Also way too much stress at service and food counter, still a very nice place but not the couple friendly place i would imagine. More an after-night joint
3
The place is a long thin corridor like space. They have great music from the 70's and 80's. The bar owner needs to curate his spirits and cocktails as much as his music though. Build in more music into the decor too
3
Went there for a special 4 course/ 4 cocktail dinner during The Singapore Cocktail Week. Must say, actually enjoyed the food more than the cocktails as they were perhaps trying a little hard to come up with too-exotic tastes.The Funky bit was the music...as the name would suggest all played on wax LP's. But blasts from the past made the medicine (that was the Chinese liqueur and gin & whisky) go down. Well worth a nibble and drink there - i would go for the tables where seats are all around versus the tables against a wall which I imagine would be a bit awkward for couples
4
We went here for Valentine's Day.The food -made by their Chilean chef- is great. Small portions, beautifully presented on the plate, delicate tastes.I'm not a fan of high-stool sitting/eating, of eating next to one another at a bar overlooking the kitchen. I prefer normal seats, a table, looking at each other
5
This is a super cute bar that my friends and I stumbled along.Gin is a winner here as is the bar menu ( which they make from scratch). Cocktails are to die for here!But the music... LP... Longplay says it all.Short and sweet was my visit and then nightcap here - Will be back again
5
We stopped in on a Sunday late after watching a movie, and were happy that LongPlay was still serving food. We'd been a few months prior to have drinks, and eyed the food, which looked really. What a pleasant surprise! There is a new chef on board, and we were able to chat with him a bit. Sounds like he has been uping the menu, and we were definitely beneficiaries. My husband had a beer he really liked, and I had a nice glass of SA Pinotage (not often available by the glass in Singapore). Music is all LPs as someone mentioned in an earlier review - a really neat feature. And as owners of hundreds of LPs, we'll definitely be back on a Sunday, which is bring your own LP day!Service is really friendly, and ambiance is great. Highly recommend
4
On Haji Lane in Singapore, Long Play has a great sense of decor - somewhat 60s/70s and a real nice old world touch done with style! The chief was fantastic in his knowledge and that is always a great turn-on when you want to experiment with a new whiskey or cocktail. Oh, and as you would imagine, the music is all LPs (of course) with that specific, crystal clear sound coming through a great music system. I understand they also have a 'bring your own LP day'. Another fabulous example of Singapore stepping it up! Bravo
5
People have commented on the poor service but we found it to be fantastic and attentive. Maybe they have read the comments?We were just looking for somewhere to have a drink and found this place. Had the house wine and it was surprisingly very good and at SG$10, a decent price.Decided to have the Manchego cheese platter which came with a non-flour grain bread and some chunky jam. Every part of the plate was very tasty and worked very well together. Very good choice of Manchego. Even though we weren't hungry, we decided to go the charcuterie plate because the Manchego was very good. The charcuterie was also very good with some very tasty muscles.Yes, the food offerings are just snacks but according to the owner they will start serving substantial meals in a month or so. They are currently curing their own meats in preparation.The new chef from Chile via Icebergs in Bondi was very friendly and knowledgeable and had no issue chatting to us whilst we sat at the bar. Definitely would go back

One of our favourite drinking corners both in Singapore and Arab Street. Tucked away at Arab street, LongPlay has its home crowd. One would never expect this place to be packed, but many times I was there, we were relegated to the bar seats. That too, is an experience itself. Once, I found out they had a barley vodka (i know i'ma nooob) bartender was sweet enough to let me taste a little of that intriguing liquid. Music was always good and surprising! The music never fails. Price wise, they are slightly above average but overall manageable as long as you don't intend to get drunk in the seat! Would recommend it to friends and couples for a great night out
2
First time to the bar and I got slightly confused as it is a long alley-like bar that has 2 opposing entrances, and I was told by Dave not to use his place as a walkthrough (and why would one do that intentionally?); despite the poor attitude, it has a great decor and thematic style going on for this place. Music on vinyl has a great touch and nice furnishing, but sadly, poor hospitality is not my thing. There are loads of other places in that area that serves high quality bespoke drinks. Food wise, not much to offer
5
Went to LongPlay this past Sunday evening hoping to stay awake for an early morning international flight. Sunday evening's are a "Bring your own vinyl" themed night which initially attracted my boyfriend and I do the establishment. While we didn't see folks bringing in vinyl we were able to make a few requests from David, the knowledgable and awesome bar manager / DJ, and were taken care of well until closing time. The service here was second to none and the music is perfect for anyone wanting an evening filled with great 1960s and 70s music. Would definitely go back
