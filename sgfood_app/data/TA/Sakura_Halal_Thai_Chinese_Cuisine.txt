Nice cosy restaurant that serves very delicious Thai Chinese dishes.
Service staff are prompt and menu is very wallet friendly.
If you're lucky you'll be able to catch the $10 fish promo.
Definitely no regrets eating here.

Hot and cold drinks are plentiful and fresh desserts are good too.Service staff are fast in clearing and replenishing f&b items.There are special pricing for senior citizens too.Recomnended for those who likes wide buffet spread and can eat alot

I have been a very sincere and loyal patron since they were located at orchard Far east if I am not wrong. First tried dish was Mee goreng, it was so juicy and spicy and never ate that type of noodles and it was like 15 years back. After which they moved to Seng kang, I was delighted as it was my resident district was warmly making myself -to enjoy all occasion to celebrate to eat there. after 5 years I shifted to Tampines and I was really surprised to know that they have moved to current address now at tampines. looks like they are following me. From then, I have been trying all their individual dishes and even seafood. it was just superb. everyone must try mango salad and thai style fried chicken.. Mouth watering.. I can finish myself the set of small cost 10 bucks
