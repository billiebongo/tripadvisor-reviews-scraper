waited here for 30mins before I could takeaway a large packet of the hokkien mee. owner-chef would take some time to cook a wok, then begin to serve the patrons in the queue. you would have to wait for the next batch should the wok gets emptied! but quite good hokkien mee, and love the chili, evidenced by the long queues

voted one of the popular Hokkien Mee stalls in Singapore, the stall does a great rendition of the popular Singaporean hawker fare, with its Hokkien Mee soaked in gooey gravy, and the chili just enhances the taste. theres always a queue at this stall, and the boss has kept the price down. a must try
