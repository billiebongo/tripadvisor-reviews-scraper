Good value for money with tender steaks, crispy fries, and the delicious almond pie. Alex was a good host who made us wish we lived in singapore.

For this price, you will get one of the best quality meat in town !
The meat will melt in your mouth. It is also nice to experiment a different type of French fries. Great neighboring area as well !

We had a great meal at Braseiro last Saturday night. The meat was juicy and tender, the home made fries was really tasty. Great service and overall experience!

Had 2 combo sets, plus one ala carte main - 3 steaks done medium, 1 beef skewer, 1 roast chicken. All the mains were juicy and tender. The habanero chilli sauce was also really nice. The salads and fries were free flow. Although simple, the salad was also really good and between us, we had 7 bowls. Dessert were 2 chocolate lava cakes. There was no food left b cause we ate it all.The host was also really friendly, and cheeky too, constantly kidding with us. Highly recommend this place for a simple and unadulterated meal in all its natural goodness.

Went there for lunch (group of 11). The ambiance was ok, As all were "cow" eaters, everyone either had the steak or the skewers in either medium rare or medium. The "cows" came slightly underdone but still acceptable.The fries were good but must eat it as soon as possible as it get soggy pretty fast. Service was good and the lady boss was very friendly.\Would I go back again?............... A definite YES

If you're looking for good meat at a fair price in singapore, it is the place to go.The menu is simple yet tasty. You will choose between 3 main courses from the grill coming along with unlimited REAL french fries (delicious!!!) and salad.We took a melted camembert as starter to share and felt straight back in France, for once in Singap ! Highly recommended for the cheese lovers. The overall feel is that the quality and quantity are definitely worth the try.I would go back with great pleasure and have a Caipirinha for sure

I have to first admit that, for the price they charge and the quantity, they are possibly peerless. Taste-wise youâ€™ll need the salt, pepper and sauces handy though.What truly let me down was the fries. Sure, the offer was all-you-can-eat. But there had to be a certain standard to it too, no? They were certainly hand cut and fried. However they looked and tasted like it was fried first thing at 11am each day and heated up when customers had to be served.

First discovered Braseiro with friends (after reading rave reviews online) a few weeks back and we had such a lovely time - food's great, atmosphere's good (music not too loud, ample space, friendly owner) - that I told my husband he ought to try it as well. And last night, hubby and I came down for a meal before my French class nearby. The homemade fries (yep, absolutely not the industrial kind) are just as lovely as the first time. This time, we didn't order steak but opted to go with chicken instead and a salad with warm goat cheese on toasts and a glass of merlot. The food portion's quite generous, we couldn't even finish the whole thing though we tried. Hubby's looking forward to trying the steak so we'll definitely be back again with friends living nearby. Braseiro is definitely one of those places you OUGHT to visit down in Joo Chiat. Great food in a very relaxed ambience for a price that won't bore a hole down your pocket.:

Went here for dinner on the back of the positive experiences posted by other reviewers on TA. Sad to say that we were rather disappointed:SERVICEIt seems I was one of the first guests to arrive. Although the restaurant has an upstairs area, the door to which was open and the lights were on, I was informed by who seemed to be the host that they "don't open the upstairs until later", when sufficient seating was available downstairs. I found this rather odd, but took a seat downstairs, as it's her place, after all... She seemed more interested in her laptop than her customers anyway. Funnily enough, during the course of our dinner, many more guests arrived who headed straight upstairs, and it seemed to be no issue. The waitress that served our table was attentive and polite. No faults here. FOOD + DRINKSWe started off with garlic bread, which was not a "Ciabatta" bread as stated on the menu, but looked much more like a hot-dog bun / defrosted mini-baguette. It did taste quite nice, and was cooked to the right degree of crunchiness.The main courses were both very underwhelming. This restaurant states on the menu something like "We would rather offer you a select few dishes done well than offer you many and sacrifice on the quality". Well, in this case I really do not want to find out what the food would taste like if they offered more than the three options given. We ordered a 200g steak and a pair of skewers, which are accompanied by unlimited French Fries and "salad" at a seemingly reasonable cost of SGD19.90 per person. Unfortunately, the quality of the meat reflects the low cost of the meal: the steak contained rather a lot of fat, my skewers had a fair amount of tendons in them and both cuts of meat were quite chewy. When the waitress asked about it, and we replied frankly, she seemed surprised, saying that the meat was from Australia, as if that automatically made it better. I will admit that some bites tastes good, but overall the cuts chosen and served to us were of a quality that left a lot of room for improvement. It certainly did not help that the meat came out not very warm and became cold within minutes of resting on our plates. The accompanying fries were acceptable, as the potatoes they were made from seemed alright, but in terms of their consistency they were a bit on the soft and saggy side. They are cooked with their skin on, which I actually quite like, so that's fine by me.Alas the "salad" was another disappointing element to the meal. It consisted of nothing more than a pile of lettuce leaves, some of which were clearly old as they showed brown edges, and some very thinly sliced tomatoes which tasted rather watery. It did not help that this was served in a stainless steel bowl which looked more like what my dog drinks its water out of at home.I ordered two root beer floats during the course of the meal. The first was served with ice-cubes in the drink, which is something that should simply never be done to a float. I did not complain but simply ordered the second one without the ice-cubes. The drink itself was delicious, and the scoop of vanilla ice-cream in both cases generous, so this was the highlight of our meal.ATMOSPHERE / AMBIANCEIf you have been to a reasonably clean kebab shop in Germany or France then you will immediately get a good feeling of what the atmosphere felt like here. This in itself can be decidedly positive, if done right. Cutlery and crockery were very basic, and they do not even give you beer mats for your drinks, so that the condensation from cold drinks will start to leave puddles on the table. The aircon and fans did an admirable job in lowering the temperature in the restaurant to a surprisingly cool level; in fact, some people would probably prefer it a little less arctic. The furniture and decoration used is basic as well, but generally fine and, importantly, the place felt very clean. I cannot comment on the upstairs area.SUMMARYWhilst this place does well in terms of the root beer, the waitress and the decoration, what really lets it down is the quality of the food, especially the much-advertised meat, and the less than welcoming hostess. Even if the prices are very low in comparison to many other places that serve meat, I still do not expect to be served cuts of such mediocre quality, nor such a poor excuse for a "salad". We will not come back

Exposes the east to proper steak, although its not a classic steak restaurant. Very cosy, and laid back cafe / restaurant, pushing out good quality Ribeye's with free flow chips (fries). I think this place would be better for couples vs groups, as the staff really struggled to get an order for eight correct, but I am not playing down the effort made by the team at Braseiro; they were very quick to correct the mistakes to our order (Med Rare, served Well Done)... they changed without question. I like this place and would re-visit... the steak and desserts were very good!
5
Clean, cosy and friendly place for a fulfilling western meal! Best to arrive with half empty stomach for unlimited replenishment of uniquely prepared French fries and fresh salad!

Our host frequents this restaurant, but we were disappointed with the steaks, which were chewy. The fries were about the best part of the meal as the salad consisted mainly of lettuce leaves. The caipirinha was different, but not something I would have again.
5
Amazing place ! Amazing waitress.
It s THE place to be in singapour ! "Un très bon moment"
Very good meat and very good fries
1
The grilling appeared amateurish and the meat was chewy with little to no marbling. You'll have better at Andes (the halal version of Aston's specialties) just across from this joint.

Wanted to try somewhere new for dinner and happened to see Braseiro, what a hidden gem!Very satisfied with the decent steaks with free flow fries & salad, at a very reasonable price! Chocolate lava cake was excellent too!Staff were very friendly, good ambience, we definitely come again! Highly recommended
5
As a change from Asian food my boyfriend decided to try Braseiro. The menu, as others have stated is limited. But sometimes that's a good thing. Quality over quantity! Between us we had the rib eye steak medium and the steak kebabs medium. Both meats had an excellent flavour and were well seasoned! The unlimited fries and lettuce was a game changer. We had refills 3 times - as we both have quite large appetites. We left full and satisfied. Would recommend

Braseiro's menu allows you to decide whether you want a 200g steak (upsize possible), beef skewer (essentially the same rib-eye steak) or chicken (unfortunately a bit dry), which for $19.90 (Apr.'16) comes with free flow of salad and home-made fries (from real potatoes, not the frozen type available elsewhere). Simple and efficient, that's the strength of the restaurant. Yes the fries may appear a little soggy, but that's because they are REAL fries, and turn out cold after a while, but that's because the serving is SOOOO big - we were not able to re-order for more! Kids loved it (imagine a Courtepaille concept with restricted menu in Singapore, if you are French) and said it was their best meal out in a long while (note: if you have kids under 10 who are not big eaters, you may prefer to order 1 kid's meal and a portion of fries, and have them share). Braseiro is affordable, not pretentious, kids-friendly, you can have deserts if you're still not full, and the staff and owners make you feel at home. All the French who had tried it were equally enthusiastic about the place, if that's a benchmark. We will definitely be back

Happended to chance upon here ....Like the ambience.. Came on a Sunday lunch time and was quiet .. only one staff attending but service was good and fast..Food wise not much of a selection, also guess since it's a weekend the promo was more on the $19.90 meat selection with free flow of fries and salad.. nothing much else on menu to order..Have to stick to the steak, chicken or barbeque skewer. Ordered the rib eye steak. Was ok for the price. Overall would say a good place for a quick meal...Nothing fancy..Oh had no soup.. would suggest to include in menu.
5
A limited menu is a sign of a restaurant which knows it's strengths and sticks to them. Steak, steak, steak and chicken. With unlimited fries and salad with a bohemian French styling- this is a trendy little place in the heart of funky Joo Chiat road. I liked the added secret terrace out the back on the first floor - perfect for a glass of red wine pre dinner

I'm writing this review late as I visited quite a couple of months back so my review won't be quite in depth.I remember the steak being nicely cooked. However, I'm not really a big fan of their fries. To each his own I guess, cause I can see how some guest next to me were enjoying it. I guess for me it was too soggy?Service wise it'll be unfair for me to review as I can tell their staff are new. Maybe they could work on how to upsell their wines. The lady that answered to my wine request just drop a page of wine on the table without even a short brief on their wines (whether it's from France or other countries etc). One weird thing was that the red wines were served really cold! The wines were obviously kept in a fridge instead of a wine cellar.Overall, I really like the place. The food is definitely worth coming back for just that I was quite taken aback from how the wine was being served.Hopefully the next time I return it would be a much better experience

The concept is simple: a limited selection of meats, accompanied with limitless servings of delicious rough-cut fries. The meat is tasty and perfectly cooked. The starters are equally nice, and don't forget to try the caipirinha.
5
Maybe the best steak and french fries in Singapore, I recommend this place to everyone ! Only $20 for the menu, you can't find another place like this in Singapore.
5
The best Value for money in Singapore to have a good Ribeye that can be upgraded of size! To try urgently. Service is really and People nice!
3
Good steak and excellent fries. A bit expensive overall (but not so much for Singapore standards). The owner was very nice.
3
A Brazilian name outside the door does attract customers interested in a good steak.The problem here is the steak is not even near a good Brazilian steak.For starters, there's only rib eye. Or something that resembles a rib-eye. Chewy, for sure.French fries were soaked in oil and soft. Generous portion, I must add.But...the caipirinha was not that bad.Good for a break, but not for an authentic Brazilian experience
5
Seriously, are they kidding us? The steak is so good, perfectly cooked, french fries are the best... you guess what... it's free flow!!!! Very generous portions, you got to choose the size of your steak, and this is a first and only time I got to do this, they are not cheating on you...Not a gastronomic restaurant, do not expect and 3 stars standards, but mainly home style and friendly atmosphere...For meet lovers, with simple tastes and good eaters!! Round of applause for this young French couple who managed to bring me back to France for the time of this dinner! Thanks

The restaurant has an easy concept of just a few dishes on a menu. The steaks are cheap, good quality and you get inlimited amount of chips and salad. It is not fancy, but rather a simple environment. I definitely recommend pop in here if you are in the area
3
A total cost of $90 for a couple steak lunch. First was the cheese dip with 6 slices of toast, followed by garlic bread. No wow factor. Upsized the steak and ordered medium but we had a variations of doneness. My steak was half medium rare and medium well. Meat was tough and struggled to cut in that tiny plate. Even though the potato fries & salad were free flow, neither were the fries piping hot and crispy, pretty average. However, desert was the best, lava cake with vanilla ice cream.
5
Going to restaurant in Singapore is most of the time an overpriced disspointment. This place isn't, not a big menu but all is good and home made. They thought about everything in detail. Our kids had their own picture menus! Best value restaurant in Singapore! (Only small request would be to have bernaise with the steak! :)
5
Staying in Singapore for three months I can enjoy all the different Asian cuisines.But it is so good to eat a 300g steak with delicious French Fries and salad the way I usually do it in Paris ;)The French staff is lovely.I Definitely recommend it
5
Place is nice and owner is very welcoming. But above all - the fries!!! Unbelievable! Free flow! Comes with great meat. Incredible value.
5
Excellent value for money: simple menu with tasty meat (beef & chicken) and free flow of fries (or salad). And the restaurant is very kids friendly.
I recommend this warmly.
4
I have only eaten here once, and my experience has been positive overall. The steaks were done beautifully, and the prices are good with free flow fries. I would go back for the steak. Service can be improved - it was slow on the night we were there
5
After weeks of great Asian food, we found ourselves in the Joo Chiat neighbourhood and ran in to this place. We were surprised by the great steak the French couple made us. Both the restaurant and neighbourhood are recommended highly. Would take anybody there .... Including parends in law and my boss :

I know I shouldn't have expected much for a $19.90 steak, with free flow fries and salad. It sounds too good to be true, and in truth, it is. It isn't expensive, but you can get better steak at Aston's. Perhaps, the rave reviews jacked up my expectation, but my steak was badly done. My brother and mother ordered a well done steak and it was served bloody. I had to send my mom's steak back, as she couldn't bring herself to eat hers. The chef took it back and 'cooked' it - returning it back to her, burnt. I understand this isn't a top class steak house, and I don't expect Morton's quality. However, my steak was so fatty with too many tough tendons, I had to cut out 30% of it.The fries are probably the best part of the meal - they were soggy, but had a quaint homecooked quality to it. Served with its skin on, and nicely salted.. this will fill up anyone, if they're not full from their steaks. The salad was fresh, with a nice vinegrette dressing
5
This place is, for me the best to enjoy a good steak at affordable price. The menu is short but the quality is there. The French fries are homemade and amazing and the best of it ? It's unlimited !!!Nice ambiance, can even access to a terrace on the second floor for an aperitif or relax after eating too much.Remember sometimes the food might take some time to get to your table because good quality food takes time to cook.Very satisfied overall and will come back for sure.

It was a last minute decision to head here, but as there were generally good reviews, and this place was listed on Entertainer, we decided to visit. However, the restaurant had so many rules and restrictions that were not clearly stated, that made the whole experience upsetting.1) DO NOT visit if you are a small eater. Even though we had purchased an appetizer and drinks, we were still expected to buy 3 main courses as there were 3 of us, probably because they thought we would just leech on their free flow fries and salad - which by the way isn't that marvellous. Maybe we had missed the sign that mentioned this rule? But it is quite ridiculous especially since we had purchased other items.2) Using the Entertainer app, if you upsize your food items, you have to pay for the upsize separately. The free item is only on the basic small portion. Again, this wasn't clear and we were only told at payment, and the boss even gave me a ridiculous explanation about how Entertainer stated that the estimated cost savings is $20. Erm I guess then all other outlets are not being accurate then? Ridiculous.3) Male manager/boss was very rude when I provided feedback, giving all sorts of excuses when I calmly told him that these should be clearly stated and pointed out to future customers. I hope this serves as a warning to future visitors to look out for these hidden rules

We ordered to M-size meats, rare, and they were perfectly cooked and very tasty.The free-flow homemade fries were also very good and a good change to usual industrial fries.For desserts, we tried the fresh fruit sherbets and they were excellent. A must try!The restaurant is big enough and family friendly
3
Braseiro offers free flow of fries and salad with every main course, it was exciting to hear but can't say the same when it arrives. The fries were cold, salad was on a bowl that screams out for a cosmetic touch-up which makes the salad overall very unappealing despite the fact that salad was indeed fresh. Steak portion and price tag was fair, prolly paying a little bit more attention on presentation would leave guests to return instead of just making it a one-time visit
4
We came into Braseiro specifically for the meat and free flow fries and salad, we were very happy with the meal! The venue itself was okay, the upstairs seating was nice, but it gets loud even with only a few people. The service was quick and efficient, and the meal itself was great. Fries were fantastic! Overall, great value for money
