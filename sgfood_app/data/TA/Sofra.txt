Second time for us here. no regrets, we leave this place bloated every time! Authentic Turkish, the breads, the appetizers, the dishes, and the tea. it is located in the second floor with nice views of the road below. Staff are excellent.
5
The restaurant has a good variety of food and beverages in their menu. The ambience is good for discussions and the staff are attentive. Food is great.
5
Love the food here. Ordered the hummus and sesame bread, mousaka, kebab platter and Turkish apple tea. Reasonably priced.
3
The service team is not able to describe the dishes clearly to us and the chairs cushion tension is slagging.. not comfortable. The food is served reasonably on time and taste okay. The hanging lights are pretty but the rest of the furnishings lack creativity.
5
The food here are very good and very delicious. The ambiance here is good too, great for business meals.

Food was good but service so so. Inattentive, could’t get their attention as they were busy celebrating their colleague’s bday. Felt staff should at least keep an eye on the customers needs

I work around Bugis and my lunch hour is erratic. I called up if I can come for lunch at 330pm, alone. The lady said no problem.When I arrived at 4pm, I was the only customer. The staff was very helpful and friendly. One reviewer said the furniture looks tired. But doesnt seem so to me. They must have renovated. Because furniture and menu looks new to me. I had mushroom chix set with apple tea and choc pudding. Big portion and delicious for the price I am paying. Will return for the rolled vine and the Baklava dessert. First Turkish restaurant I visited outside Turkey. I will return again.

Sofra seems to be reaching the end of its life. I remember dining at Sofra 10 years ago. Back then, service was good, food was tasty and price was reasonable.I visited Sofra today as I was craving for authentic Turkish food. Sadly, the place looks tired, chairs were worn, and decor was old. The staff tried their best at being nice but at some point, no staff were keeping at eye on the diners so we had to wave our hands for a long time before getting anyone's attention. The food was ok, nothing fantastic and I felt that the food was overpriced. You can easily get a good Turkish meal at Arab St maybe for a lesser price.We ordered Ice Lemon Tea and what was served seemed to be syrup and not authentic Ice Lemon Tea. I don't think I will come back to Sofra again...sadly.

My friends and I went to Sofra in December. Fortunately we got there at 11.30am before the lunch crowd came in. The selection of food was pretty good. They even have set meals that are very reasonably priced and the sets come with a cup of drink. We ordered the hand-made bread with the hummus. It was really good. The four of us ordered a pizza, it was very delicious. Then we ordered another 2 other dishes to share. Did not take note of the names of the dishes. One was chicken that came with their own sour cream sauce, and another dish which was a mixed platter of meats. All come in reasonable helping. Tasty but not awfully salty. Just nice. The bill at the end of the meal was pretty reasonable too. Good place if you have muslim friends to dine with. Worth going there for a meal if you have not tried it before

Dined twice in three days at the last week of November. Nice large variety in the menu. You can see Turkish chefs working in open kitchen. One of the managers (Turkish gent with long hair) is a real restaurateur with excellent communication skills. Their hot and cold food is good. Eggplant salad is phenomenal, kebab is good but they need to do something with the dessert across the board, they were far from being original. They have nice corner of Turkish products. I have to mention that they need to do something with one of the local server who stands in front of food pass area while keeping his arms behind his butt and stares around like a body guard / bouncer who is ready to kick the not-paying drunks customers of if the bar! This young man is absolutely spoiling the whole experience as you ask him to give you water and he pretends he didn’t hear when you go up to him and repeat he shakes his hands. It doesn’t even move. I wonder how come he is still there. This is an awesome place and u doubly the best Turkish cuisine venue of the city.

Very pleasant interior, staffs were friendly, serving time is quick and food is definitely tasty, very value for money restaurant.
4
Had a wonderful lunch and tried Turkish food for the first time.
Food was great and we enjoyed it a lot.
Great experience!
4
Food was very good. Very clean place and service was prompt. Would definitely visit this place again. Overall a very comfortable and pleasant experience for my wife and myself. Keep it up.
4
Restuarant has been around for more than 16 years. Been there more than 10 years back & had dinner there with friends recently. Lighting is brighter than before and there are more food choices. Food & drinks are delicious!
5
Food was still great after all these years. Last time I was here was 10 years ago. I got the corner seating with a great view as per my request through my booking via Chope. Highly recommended for anyone who crave Turkish Food.
5
Being in love with turkish food means scouting for new places all the time. But i keep coming back to Sofra for a consistently delicious and well-priced fare. Their hummus is amazing, definitely order some hot sesame bread with it. The star for me is the lentil soup! Just this combination of bread, soup and hummus is perfect for a light meal. Their kebabs are great, most served with rice and salad. I somehow tend to prefer their chicken over lamb. The tukish tea ties the meal together beautifully. They are located on the first floor in shaw tower on beach road, and if you can get a seat by the window, you can watch the world go by as you enjoy your meal. ☺

I heard about Sofra before and the family was in the area for dinner. You can see the restaurant from the street and would be east to make this restaurant more popular.They have a good selection of starters, main dishes and desserts. We ordered the hummus, some meat dishes and a musakka. They were actually all good and tasty. Well seasoned and most served with fragrant rice. We did not have spicy dishes for the kids and they favourites were the Guvec Tavuc and the Doner kebab rice. I wanted to try the Adana kebab but the food was already too much. Will be coming back. Please note that the order of the hummus does not automatically come with bread so don’t forget to order the bread. Which come to my last point, while food was actually good, service is bordering to bad. The servers are not rude but they are just not attentive, thorough (did not mention about ordering bread for the hummus) and slow: The place was not full, yet you need to call them and takes a while to come. By the way we had the baklava and the kuniefe and they are really good, probably the highlight of the night.Would be nice to come with a big group and taste more dishes.
5
The Turkish motive set up of this restaurant was nice and well decorated.We start off with the sesame seed bread and humus as appetizer. Bread was crispy,serve hot and the humus was wonderful.The main dish of kebabs,rice and others are also tasty and serving portion was acceptable.We finish off with one of with their pudding rice.Also very nice.We recommend any one who wanted to try Turkish food at their best to visit Sofra
3
Tried two Turkish restaurants in two days; I just love the cuisine. I had last eaten here in the 1990s - so a return visit was long overdue. If you can survive that long in the competitive Singapore dining scene, you are probably doing a good job. However, I was in for a slight disappointment. The restaurant has a pretty extensive menu, but I guess given the clientele, they only focus on doing a few high-volume dishes right. The rest of it seems to lack passion. The Turkish dessert kunefe was good, but not great. I will still go back and try some other, popular dishes to see if they do it right before making a more-final judgment
4
This is one of our favourite Turkish food finds. The food are always so good and very consistent with the quality of their dishes. Nice bright, clean, quiet and calming. Thou they're not too fancy or to date in décor the ambience sets that nice classy feeling. I have always look forward to having our anniversary dinner/lunch here. However they could improve on their service. There was hardly a crowd, and yet their servers were somewhat distracted while we waited for our order to be taken
5
Our umpteenth time here and food was good as always. The chefs somehow manage to keep the quality consistent every time. Service was prompt and attentive too. The hummus and sesame bread are a must-try!
5
My friends and I had a lovely time catching up over the great food and ambience. The staff were very friendly and responsive.
4
The food was great and ambience was good. Service was all right and can be improved. The food portion was reasonable.
5
Love coming here for their lunch set. Usually bring my colleagues together for a quick lunch before going off for work meetings.
3
This place is quite good value at lunch. I had a kebab and drink today for $9 with quite efficient service. The kebab was a little on the small side (still hungry afterwards) but was tasty.
4
Food taste quite good especially the sesame bread. Price was considered reasonable. There is lesser crowd during dinner as compared to lunch time.
4
Sofra has served consistent delicious Turkish food since inception. Have always enjoyed the food with the family. Service could be better as the kitchen was a bit overwhelmed when we dined on the eve of a public holiday. The genial owner made the extra effort being my birthday. And the view from the restaurant in the evening twilight and traffic below lent gave it a surreal glow
5
Our team (19 of us) went for lunch and it was a wonderful experience. The restaurant was obviously very busy during lunchtime but the servers remained friendly and approachable. It was a first time trying Turkish cuisine for many of us and it did not disappoint. The hummus was especially good! Will bring my other friends and my family to this place again
4
It was my 2nd visit. And each time the food was good. I had been to Turkey previously and I can say that the food here was pretty authentic and fantastic. The creme brûlée I had in Turkey was awesome and addictive. Sad to say that here, the creme brûlée (actually rice pudding) wasn't as good as the one I had in Turkey. Still, overall the food was great. Will come back again
3
Located in shaw tower rather sad looking corner .. were looking for Turkish food and googled here Ordered 1) hummus ( just ok)and sesame bread (weird meat flavour taste)2) chicken soup of the day - ok 3) Adnani kebab ( small portion for price had salads n rice with it and rice dint go well with it ) 4) veg kebab .. misleading it was some mixed vegetable curry with 2 pieces of bread ( again had weird meat taste ) Service was good Ambience ok Would not recommend nor retur
3
Would consider going there again to have a try on other selection in their menu. Not a bad place to recommend those who wishes to have a try on Turkish cuisine.
4
Even though the price was abit pricey but food was good. Hope waiter can be more attentive towards the customers. Waiter should also know their knowledge of the menu served.
4
Surprised by the big portion of food and totally enjoyed the food as they were well prepared and piping hot!
4
food was excellent as always. dates were provided for customers who was fasting. atmosphere was good
5
We enjoyed the food a lot. Restaurant was very crowded and busy coz many people came to break fast. Hence it was a bit hard to hear each other above the din. Other than that we had an enjoyable outing
4
Turkish food in sofra were special and uniquely flavoured.. something worth trying and exploring in sg :)
5
Went to Sofra for a dinner. It was a pleasant experience, food was served fast, service was attentive too. One of our fave mediteranian restaurant!
4
Came here to treat my family to a Turkish feast. We were craving some Turkish food and came to the right place. Food feels authentic enough, not too spicy and not too bland either. Price wise is average, whilst the service is good enough. We were too stuffed to try the Turkish sweets but saw a few diners enjoying them. Checkout the groupons available for this restaurant as you can get away with some savings
3
I have been visiting the place for more than 3 years. My initial visits to the place were more than pleasant. Friendly service. Good food and servings. The staff even offer you a lemongrass hand sanitiser before you leave the restaurant.Unfortunately, the service seems to be less friendly now. While the quality of food seems to be the same, the servings appear smaller.Hope the restaurant will buck up. Otherwise, it's tragic to lose an otherwise family-friendly restaurant offering turkish food
1
Food not bad although small portions and I felt were over-priced, 15 Singapore dollars before tax for a small veg stew and 2 quarters of bread. Extra bread requested was charged for which I didn't expect as always complimentary in other places I have eaten in. Service incredibly slow and we had to chase our order but this could be down to it being a busy Friday night with only about 6 staff serving and a few large groups.Not a typical restaurant environment to sit in, it's a large room on 2nd floor of a tower block; reminded me of a work canteen.
4
Good variety of food for everyone from halal to vegetarian friendly! Big place to accommodate big groups for gatherings too.
4
Went there only because of a Groupon coupon. The atmosphere is a bit sterile, but the food was really good.
4
Food is really nice, very authentic with lots of choices on the menu. Service is friendly and quick.
3
Average food. Nothing to shout about. Probably can find better food elsewhere. The place looks gloomy and lack of life
3
Lunch set is good. I go regularly for work lunches. Service can be improved. Quiet and nice. Definitely worthy lunch set in terms of value.
5
Good for sharing and not too bad food...love the hummus!one of the staff can't really understand what we wanted when we asked him if there was roasted egg plant in any of our dishes ordered...he said no...in the end, there was 2 of it! Lotsa bread in almost all selection so go eas
5
Although the restaurant has been there for almost 3 decades, this was my first visit. It didn't disappoint at all! I love the setting, the food and the service. I've been to Istanbul once before, so I feel their menu here is tweaked to local taste buds. It's OK. Still delicious! I'll come back for more the next time I want to bring my family for good food
5
Excellent food. Good service. Overall a very good experience. Went there with my wife and son and we all thoroughly enjoyed the food! Was't too crowded on a Saturday lunch time which is quite unique in Singapore as most of the eateries are crammed. Will strongly recommend to people who wants to enjoy authentic Turkish cuisine in SIngapore
4
My last visit to Shaw Towers at Beach Road was decades ago and was pleasantly surprised to find this interesting place with Turkish food here. Apparently it's been around for a while and rather popular. Love the thin sesame bread which went well with hummus. Being an eggplant fan, was delighted to see a variety of ways they serve it. Service staff was helpful and gave good recommendations. Would visit again.
4
We stumbled upon this place and recalled our Turkish associate in Singapore raving about it. Our dinners -- eggplant and lamb for one of us, and lamb/beef kebab for the other -- were well-prepared, tasty, and promptly served. The eggplant dish in particular was to die for (in a good way, to be clear!) Service was strong though not excellent, as others here have observed, but the deliciousness of our meals more than made up for it. We live in Singapore and Sofra will be on our short-list rotation of restaurants to frequent
3
inconsistent food quality. our first visit was much better. service was poor- had to ask for water 3 times before we were finally served, and waited > 15 minutes for the bill (had to ask for it 3 times as well).
4
The ambience was cosy and the food was yummy. However, the waiter was a little too enthusiastic in clearing the dishes.
3
Had lunch here today with some colleagues. The beef/lamb kebab plus rice and a drink for $12 is reasonable value and the food quality was ok. Service was a little haphazard, but that's a common issue in Singapore.
2
Bad service and poor treatment. Appreciative menu though. The bills are swapped and their food is average. Not worth the price... advisable- arab st is right beside where you get better service and save on car parking.
3
Not really a good Turkish taste, but you can say it's Turkish dishes, half of what we ordered was good.
4
Food was authentic. Service was attentive safe for one waitress who looked very unhappy.So was coffee and desserts which were not easy to find in Singapore.Price was reasonable as well for out party of 13 pax, we spent about $500.00.Only gripe was they did not expect the lunch crowd and did not prepare enough lamb chops. A real pity
5
Had lunch there during CNY holidays. Food Very Good, Service Excellent, Price Reasonable. Enjoyed my experience at this restaurant with my family. Though a little old, this place has a Turkish charm. there were some display of Turkish products and TV screen showing scenes of Turkey. Unfortunately my back was to the TV. It would be good if they had extra TV sets so that more can view the video.
5
As a Turkish I tend to visit Turkish Restaurant where ever I go.Sometimes food in Turkish Restaurant may not be so Turkish. However Sofra's food was really good.We had lahmacun, bread mins meat on top with thinly chopped vegetables like onion, tomato , pepper. It was tasty.Ayran , yoghurt drink is avarage taste and desert is Kunefe icecream on top. That was really good as well.Turkish tea in glass and very friendly stuff and owner reflects reall Turkish hospitality.Lunch time is was full with people 
4
I went to Sofra for family dinner.We are a family of 6.We were attended to once we were seated.We ordered moussaka,lamb chop,spaghetti,pizza,kebab,another dish washer lamb,mashed potatoe and cheese,pita,sesame breads,hummus,3 apple tea,iced lemon tea and turkish tea.The food was very authentic and delicious.The breads were to die for and hummus was licked clean.There was an open window to view the chefs cooking and grilling.The bill came up to $169 but it was worth it.When we left the manager washed the females hands with rise water and the males hands with lemongrass water as per Turkish traditions.Had a wonderful experience and food journey.Highly recommended

I purchased a voucher from Groupon and thought of trying the turkish food in Sofra restaurant. Totally disappointed with the way how this restaurant is managed.Is very sad to see this restaurant empty and this is due to poor management. Bread is offered for free in every turkish restaurant all over the world but not here . I had to pay 4.80 dollar for a peace of bread. Where in the world a turkish restaurant serves baked chicken with mushroom or kebab kofta with only rice and no bread? Where in the world a turkish restaurant doesnt offer soup?The portion of dishes we ordered were very small and for the first time in my life i leave a turkish restaurant still hungry. The reason why most of restaurants offers groupon vouchers is to let customers try their food so they get satisfied and come back again. That wasnt the case for Sofra restaurant. They choose very limited options of food and deserts for you and dont give u chance to try what you want to eat. Their glasses of drinks are very small and you have no choice but to order again.Still the staff is friendly and will do their best to serve as good as they can.Overall our experience was bad and me personally won't come again to this restaurant.Dinner 27.11.201
4
I have passed by the restaurant a couple of times but never tried. Purchased the groupOn deal for four pax. I had the baked chicken and mushroom dish. For starters, we shared the sesame bread and hummus. It was piping hot and v delicious indeed.
4
They server tasty turkish food, try the kebabs and rolls.
The place is neat, quiet and clean.
Recommended only if you have a taste towards Mediterranean food, else you might not like it.
4
Had lunch here with friends on workday. Near office, good food. the set meal is pretty value for money. serving pretty quick and ambience is good
4
A nice ambience setting. Good service from staffs. Great kebab taste. Delicious Turkish coffee served.
Will return again.
4
Went there for a friends bday. Nice place and nice ambience. Wouldnt say food is cheap, but it is a Turkish speciality restaurant, with good food, so i guess it justifies it. Kid Friendly.Friendly service all the way. We tried the meat platter, mutton sheekh, chicken and their version of roti, besides others. Meat was very tender and nice. In drinks i tried the lime+soda drink they had. Was good, i tried two more after that :-). Hummus was good as well. Overall i would rate this place a good place to eat, with an unique experience
4
Visited this Sofra Restaurant along Beach Road. Their main advertisement on their window display is still the remarkable Maiden Tower on Bosphorus Canal in Istanbul. Just to recollect this good Turkish food decided to dine here.Clean cosy Turkish restaurant serving a wide selection of authentic cuisines. Friendly waiters assisted on the menu. Tasty food at above average prices. Slight differences from Istanbul, but still enjoyed
4
What better way to spend memorable events like birthdays, anniversaries, Mother's & Father's Day other than at an authentic restaurant serving Turkish cuisine. Situated at the outskirts of town area, the restaurant's outer view overlook busy traffic and high-rise buildings. We were greeted with typical Turkish warmth greeting by the manager. We do not have to travel miles away to Istanbul to experience it. The kebabs served were good enough to fill the empty stomach and filled us to our heart's content. You should try the jumbo platter consist of a generous serving for two. Succulent and tender chunks of chicken, beef and mutton grilled to perfection.Salivating already? What are you waiting for...come over to experience it your own..
4
I like the Turkish food, the boss was very nice to offer me free tea.But the waiter and waitress were unfriendly and had to keep calling them. They were not welcoming or happy especially the lady staff.And there is no music played in the restaurant which felt very weird, too quiet. we could here everyone else's conversations. Both times i visited the restaurant, there was no music.I hope the restaurant will do something about the ambience. Other than that, food is good.
3
A reasonably priced Turkey food if one wanted to sample a meat and bread meal for a change.The bread is freshly baked and the meat are well prepared giving you the middle eastern taste.I would always like to end it with a cup of Turkish tea. The service is reasonable but if you see the boss, he is always there to please.The price is reasonable too and a place to try out new experience after too much of local and western food
3
This was lauded as the "Best Turkish Restaurant in Singapore"...but it missed the mark for me. The food was OK, lots of good skewers of meat, Turkish bread, and accompaniments of rice and salad. The food would have been better if the servers explained what the things on the menu were - it was quite hard to order off the menu if one was not familiar with Turkish food (which I was not). The saving grace for me was the excellent Baklava - not too sickly sweet, generous with the pistachio and lovely texture. Would go back just for the Baklava
4
Came here with a colleague on a Saturday night, pretty dead to be honest but we were really hungry and it was open. Pleasantly surprised that the food was good. Get the chef's palate, there was a lot of meat on it :)
4
The adana mixed beef and lamb is great. Pretty much the closest authentic Turkish place in Singapore. Service is not very good as the staff seems to hate being there.
4
Not so many varieties of food they offered, but taste is excellent. They also have vegetarian menu. Nice restaurant ambiance, really good for group dinner.
3
The bread was good and went well with the meat. But if eaten alone, the meat was too salty for me. Plenty of seats during lunch time on a weekday. Good for an occasional visit but not really value for $.
5
Tasty dona kebah chicken rice. Also tried the beef lamb kebah. Lunch promotion Cost 9.90 for each set and come with a small cup of drink. The chicken is well marinated and their rice are specially made and taste good. They give quite a generous portion of small chunks of tomato. One of my favourite Turkish food. Enjoy
4
I have lunch after a busy meeting in shaw tower, during lunch the restaurant is quite busy so you better have reservation prior. I had this rice with beef and lamb in turkish way and it really delicious, recommended place to dine when you visit singapor
3
We have been frequenting Sofra at Beach Road Singapore for several years now and have watched their service levels deteriorate over time prompting this review. Having to ask for water is a tell tale sign!We asked to change our seats and were politely told the table we wanted was reserved. But we were appalled when another family walked in, told the waiter they did not have a reservation and were shown right to the table we'd requested like 3 minutes back! There seem to a lot waiters in the restaurant who all seemed to be living in a world of their own, condescending every now and again to the mundane matters of having to serve the guests. If the food were not as good as it is, we would probably not keep going back. On that count, we have to add this is among the most reasonably priced and most authentic Turkish places around. That is without a doubt. The Kunife is to die for and all the koftas are generally very good. The pides are sometimes a bit off but the sesame bread is always excellent, as are the dips. The hand cologne is a nice finishing touch they have added recently. All in all, the food is definitely a big magnet
4
Decent and reasonably priced Turkish food. As review say there is no service but I came here solely for the food. This is my favourite spot for Turkish chicken rice. It has been there for very long time and it is near my office. When my overseas collegues come, I will bring them to this restaurant if they like to try Mediterranean food. The chicken is very well marinated and the rice is marinated with special chicken ingredient. Came here for lunch and they have lunch promo for free drink. Worth coming
5
Came here with a family of 8. We ordered quite a range of kebabs ranging from doner chicken kebabs, mixed kebabs and humus appetizer.The one I love is definitely the Adana Kebab because it comes with a sword and meat attached to it. The ones I recommend are: Adana Kebab, Mushroom Fish, Iskender Kebab and Doner Kebab Rice. The rest I have not tried them yet. Will be back soon to try out the rest.Oh...and the place is peaceful too. Not to many shoppers and accessible by bus
3
The restaurant is on the 2nd level of Shaw Towers and the window seating is quite nice for an idyllic afternoon or evening meal. We had the jumbo kebab combo for two persons which was well presented and the cacik yoghurt went well together. The service was attentive and overall the food quality was decent and authentic. Reasonably priced too. Not the best place for special occassions but not a bad place for normal dining when you are in the area and need a place to relax and enjoy some kebabs
5
For those like Turkish food, it is the best place in Singapore, located in the 2nd floor of Shaw Tower, service is fast, their thin bread with kebabs are just amazing.
5
It's like Mediterranean food here. Located at beach road, very near to suntec city and bugis. They serve food such as kebabs. It's nice and delicious. It's on the second floor of the shaw tower.
3
Interesting menu, fairly tasty. Presentation of food is average and a lot of it is similar looking. I would have expected more spice.
1
This was a disappointment. The food, service, general ambiance were all just OK.
The Donna meat kebab wasn't bad, the pide was tasteless, and there is little value for money.
Places around Arab street are probably a better bet.
4
The restaurant is approved by Singapore Islamic Board, which is a nice way of knowing it's authenticity. The food served was delicious and it is quite plate-full. I had a full course meal to my heart's content with my family (3pax) and it costed SGD 120 (USD 83.60). The restaurant is located in Shaw towers on the second floor. The place needs some refurbishment and rearrangement.
3
Great location , near Raffles hotel with tasty Turkish food , but this is where the good points end, you go up stairs to a cafe than a restaurant cheap style seating , very basic service, no alcoholic drinks, and very very basic, if it was not for the food which was OK this place is not worth calling it a restaurant as the Sofra chain we know in Londo
4
Don't forget to make a reservation cos this place is good. We had beef pide, red lentil soup, grape leaves roll and a jumbo platter.All dishes were wiped out in a matter of minutes leaving us with a smile of satisfaction. Prices are decent enough and the staff were attentive and polite. Good place for dinner with the family or for business lunch.
1
I don't normally write reviews for places in Singapore because I live here and it's home for me. However, I am forced to write this review because I seriously think this place needs the feedback. I went in on a weekday evening hoping for a quiet dinner. However, it was a waste of our time, energy and money. We ordered pita bread and hummus and a couple of kebab platters. The pita bread was the only thing that tasted fine because I think it was made fresh. The hummus was completely bland and unappealing. I am a huge fan of middle-eastern food and I've eaten at most of the restaurants serving Turkish and Lebanese food. So it wasn't like I did not know what to expect. The meats were horribly dry and rubbery! i got the feeling that they had been reheated and the taste was stale. It was such a disappointment! I had been here about 2 years back and quite enjoyed the food. But judging from the empty tables, I'm guessing the restaurant has stopped trying. Service was lacklustre. A lady came and just plonked down our dishes on the table without a word explaining which one was what. Overall it was a dismal experience. My husband and I were trying to have a date night after a fair bit of time. The experience certainly ruined it for us. I strongly recommend you to stay away
4
As its really hard to find decent turkish food in Asia I would rate this place as above average. After experiencing some of the turkish restaurants around Arab Street as a native turk this place was passable. The place is quiet central and easy to find. Food selection is pretty decent
1
My family and I have eaten in some gorgeous Turkish eateries throughout the world Unfortunately this restarant didn't come close. We walked in with our one year old son and told there would be a high chair provided, but then informed there were none, funnily when we were walking out one materised. We should have known at this point to run for the door!!! However been hungry we proceeded to order approx 15 minutes after sitting down . When the food finally arrived it was in eatable and arrived all at the same time , stale bread, None fresh vegetables and a main vegetarian kebab that looked like what veg was left over blended to make use of them. We as a consequence left most of it and was never asked once how the food was. I think they may have been scared to as the food was untouched . When we came to pay the only thing we refused to proceed with was the service charge. In Britain we tip for good service , this was none existent. The owner/manager involved himself at this point and although perfectly cordial didn't really see the issue . We were given a "members" 5 % discount at which I think we were suppose to be grateful to be given a final comment hope to see you again. This will never happen, please do not make our mistake
3
Very nice turkey food and I like the bread so much so much is my favorite, the food is nice worth for visit however they need to improve the service, we wait for long time of the drink to be served :(
4
Good food. Only resturant in this area with Arabic cuisine. Nice variety. They have good spread of drinks and dessert for the end too!
3
Had dinner here with a group of friends. My partner and I ordered the hummus, chef's plate and the pizza and the dessert Kunefe. Service was ok, food was decent to good.Only complaint was that the food wasn't hot enough, if not it would be been better
4
I had lunch here with a coworker(a vegitarian) and my wife.My wife and I had the kebab set lunches, and they were fantastic.My coworker's turkish bread thing was huge and she said it was good.Service was a bit slow. But the food was very hot and fresh. The bread must of came straight out of the oven.We'll be back soon
3
The owners of this restaurant are really nice and jolly but this attitude isn't always apparent in their staff. Over the years, we have come across some horrendous attitudes from the staff. The food is quite nice! Nice variety too! I love their Turkish hot apply tea
1
Very dissapointed with Sofra as i was looking for some good persian food in town. Decor is VERY tired and old and so is their food. Portions are small and its high priced for the overall quality of food and ambience they offer. No plans at all to be going back there as the only decent food was their pita bread while the rest was really bad.
4
This place gets crowded for lunch this there is quite a waiting time from your order to get the food. But that wait certainly is worth it. The food was really tasty and its authentic presentation made a real deal. Most staff were nice n frindly.

My significant other & I try to celebrate our wedding anniversaries here to reminisce our trip to Turkey on our honeymoon in 2000. Love the mixed platter which is good for two to share so we have space for desserts live baklava & kefir with ice cream. Decalicious = decadent & delicious!!! Must go there again soon

My husband and I have been eating at Sofra for years, the most recent where we brought our son for dinner on a Friday night. We were asked if we had reservations (a must), but since we were just taking our chances the receptionist upon seeing me with a toddler in tow managed to get us a table. My son who is fussy when it comes to eating out loved it, especially that he can look out the big windows and see cars and traffic (better than an ipad) outside. Service throughout was good and prompt even if the place is packed

The food more than makes up for the slow service. Went here for lunch and it took 30 mins for the hummus to get out. I was up against a meeting, so didn't have much time to sit around. HOWEVER, the food more than made up for it. Everything was delicious. You can taste the fresh chickpeas in the hummus. And it wasn't swimming in oil. You have to order the bread separately. It comes out warm and fresh. Simply amazing. Grape leaves were tender, and the pickled cabbage was tart, just the way I like it! Had the lamb doner lunch special too -- all very very good, but way too much food. In total, $35 for 2 people. And we had leftovers to take home. Can't wait to come back to this restaurant when I have more time

The chefs are from famous Goctu Restaurant in Mersin, Turkey. Their menu cannot be surpassed, the food tastes fresh and always good, the service is fast, the kitchen is super clean and it is in front of your eyes.

Based on the reviews, we decided to try Sofra out. They have authentic Turkish food. Great entil soup, Turkish bread and Spaghetti. All their starters are vegetarian which is a plus for vegetarians like us.
Conveniently located.
This will become a regular for us now.

I was there with my office folks to celebrate some feat we all achieved... It was a great experience... The cost is reasonable... Great choice of breads... You must try their lamb dishes...There are some great desserts on their menu... Don't miss them...If you get to sit near the glass window, it's a awesome view to mostly lively part of Singapore... It was bit raining when we were there, so it looked nice..

We had 2 appetizers namely the mutabul (eggplant paste salad) & vine leaf dolma. Both were very bland. The main dishes were Adana kebab & Iskender kebab. Taste wise the Adana kebab was good but the sauce on the Iskender kebab was bland. Atmosphere wise nothing to write home about. Price wise the appetizers were over priced for the quantity & we were charged for Turkish bread (which should have been free with the salad). The main meal was avg price of sgd18(before tax). Service was also average. Not a place that I would want to come back soo

To say that the food at Sofra is "mediocre" is to be incredibly generous. I went with friends -- we tried a variety of Turkish/Middle Eastern fare (a cuisine I generally enjoy very much) and I did not find a single item to be prepared well. The lamb was tough and basically tasteless; the salads were completely undistinguished; even the breads were poor. In a city of wonderful restaurants, why would anyone in his right mind choose this one

Located in a building that has an Indian movie theater - we were introduce by an Indian vegeterian friend to this nice restaurant.As I also eat just vegetarian - I found a lot of dishes that I could eat in this restaurant : a few types of eggplant salads, humus, home made bread, etc. My carnivor companion enjoyed a lot the meats. We also bought an eggplant jar - delicious - Turkish cheese, nuts, etc. as they have a little corner with Turkish products for sale. You get a 5 dollar voucer for next visit. Nice and pleasant

The restaurant is well spaced out and so it was quite relaxing. The portions were also quite satisfactory. However, the service was not so satisfactory. The waiters generally had a very glum disposition and didnt serve the food to the guests - the platters of kababs etc can be quite heavy to pass around. The food was also quite cold when it reached out table. Overall so-so. Given a choice, I would try another place

Kebabs and Turkish breads ... nothing less you'll expect from a Turkish restaurant.If you ain't a fan of Turkish cuisine, then this might not be the best place for you.Main course approx. $30-$40 per pax excluding taxesPersonally had tried Turkish of similar standards at fraction of costs in here.Might consider to be back for quiet ambience ... but definitely not for location

A gathering dinner with friends. We order a few item Beyti Kebab, Chicken bake rice and The chef plate.The Chef plate have all type of meat, beef , chicken and lamb. It worth trying! At first we have trouble with the order maybe thats the cause of making the waiter fed up. But the owner or the turkish guy working there is very kind and serve us well! And the portion is quite big

My friends and I were at Sofra for lunch. We ordered several dishes for sharing, and found the portions decent and food reasonably priced. A place to consider if there's an urge to have Turkish food!

Food took forever to come i had finished mine and some were still waiting for food. Restaurant was not busy so could not understand slow service. Food was cold and dry ive had better

We suppose we’ll never find a Turkish restaurant in Singapore that offers the same exquisite spices as those in Istanbul, but we continue to search. We have tried Alaturka, Anatolia, DeliTurk, and Divan Turkish Café. Our ultimate taste test usually is the combination of kunefe and apricot nectar. Unfortunately, our favorite Turkish restaurant, Divan, closed last year, and DeliTurk in Suntec City is a bit far from our routine paths. At last, after frequently seeing the blue sign on the second-story restaurant at the end of Middle Road but feeling discouraged by some of the reviews, we finally had lunch at Sofra. We were very pleasantly surprised. There were many choices of tables at the windows, and the interior was informal and friendly. There was even a corner with sofa and a painting of whirling dervishes. We shared one chicken moussaka, rice, one kofte, and peach juice. The moussaka was quite good—better than at one restaurant (named Faros Sirkeci) where we tried it in Istanbul. The rice and kofte were tasty, as well. For dessert we had two pieces of baklava which were quite nice and a slice of kenefe without ice cream. The kenefe was unexpectedly excellent because the filo pastry on top was browned and crispy. Staff varied between experience and inexperienced, but they all tried hard. The meal would have been perfect if only apricot nectar was on the menu and the group at the table next to us had been less ebulliently boisterous. Sofra will be our most-frequented Turkish restaurant in Singapore for the foreseeable future due to its convenient location, the great mouossaka, reasonable price, and their very addictive kenefe

Food is definitely overrated and nothing to shout about but service is the worst I have ever experienced in Singapore! We went there for lunch. The restaurant wasn't busy with several tables of diners but the service staff were simply disinterested in their job, and they showed it! Plus, they were obviously untrained. We went elsewhere for coffee as we were fed up with the appalling service. Will never visit again

love to eat differently once a while. their kebab and pizza are extraordinary. turkish tea? hmm... strong stuff, spicy aromatic. I love the bread, i think its fresh and self-made. would love to come back again. and the price is average. range: $10-25$ reasonable.the ambiance is subtle turkish, with minimalist design. don't expect musky smell, theirs actually modern. clean. their floor-ceiling glass let you see the road intersection while you are waiting for your food to come. do try the "chef's plate" all in one plate.
