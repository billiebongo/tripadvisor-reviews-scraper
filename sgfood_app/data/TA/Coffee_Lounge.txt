Enjoy porridge with a good selection of local dishes in a cosy restaurant housed in the heritage Goodwood Park Hotel. Comfort food at its best!

Amazing afternoon tea. Book before hand :buffet. No need for supper! Delicious savoury and sweet treats. Colonial feel and wonderful service where you feel you can stay as long as you like

I stayed in the Goodwood Park hotel and tried their coffee lounge for breakfast. I was looking for their famous Taiwan Porridge but it wasn’t served yet so I ordered the local congee. I had no regrets. It was a really good congee with chunks of fish. I also loved the side dishes including boiled peanuts. The service was great although it could have been faster

A Taiwanese porridge meal is the ultimate comfort food. The soothing factor starts with the rice porridge which is plainly cooked with sweet potatoes. It is eaten with a range of Chinese dishes which mum will cook at home. Although often compared with Teochew Muay (porridge), besides the sweet porridge, there are some subtle differences with the accompanying dishes.Chye Poh (preserved radish) omelette is a common dish eaten with both porridges. Coffee Lounge at Goodwood Park Hotel is one of the few places left serving Taiwanese porridge in Singapore and very good at that. Their chye poh omelette is a precisely shaped pancake which is slightly crispy on the outside, eggs and chye poh well-cooked but fluffy on the inside. It is best eaten with a dash of the ground red chilly with garlic. My only complaint with Coffee Lounge is that I wished they serve it larger than the hand-sized disc.Another common dish across the porridges is Mui Choy (preserved mustard greens) braised with belly pork (although it is technically a Hakka dish I’m told). Coffee Lounge’s other signature dishes include their cold Japanese tofu with a sweet sauce topped with pork floss, deep fried pomfret with fish soya sauce and Nai Bai (bak choy) stir-fried with garlic. That about sums up my typical meal at Coffee Lounge since the 1980s.As you sit down, they would serve (with compliments) another of my favourite: braised peanut. The soft peanut is so good that I always request for seconds as another dish with my meal. The porridge is refillable and I always ask for extra sweet potatoes.Goodwood Park is of course the quaint hotel still in its original regal state along Scotts Road. Coffee Lounge is classy and modernly decorated such that one would not expect it to serve the humble Taiwanese porridge. The clientele seems to be regulars like myself who enjoys this comfort food in an elegant environment.The Coffee Lounge also serves typical local fare and western dishes too including a clever degustation menu. The Taiwanese porridge comes a la carte with options of bento set meals.The service staff are also long-timers but this recent visit, we were well served by an intern called Chimi from Bhutan. My dinner friend then remarked that he climbed up Eagle’s Nest and was politely corrected: Are you sure you didn’t take a pony up Tiger’s Nest?Goodwood Park Hotel pioneered durian puffs. We were recommended their durian dessert which was essentially two seeds of durian in coconut milk. We should have stayed with their classics.I do hope Goodwood Park continue to serve this Taiwanese Porridge classic for another thirty years

Thank you for the wonderful arrangement. The (champagne & cake) was a pleasant surprise! Caroline and the rest of the team was very hospitable throughout the evening. There couldnt be a better place to celebrate my wife's birthday. Love the Kuai Pa Tee, Fish Curry and Durian pastries/cakeNot so much of a durian pastry person, preferring the actual fruit instead but it the selection were really good. especially the Macha Durian Cake

I admit, I prefer the original Tiffin Lounge, famous for its porridges and late hours, and gracious architecture. The porridges are still wonderful, but the setting has become pseudo Frank Lloyd Wright tossed with Asian coffee lounge standard decoration. And the insertion of the buffet service just contributes to distracting noise and traffic back and forth to tables. This could be any one of thousands of similar coffee lounges around Asia. To the menu: the laksa was gorgeous, and a huge portion. Likewise the ho fan. Staff was professional - actually some I recognised from when the place had been the original Tiffin! I'm not a fan of durian anything, but by the numbers of ladies scarfing at the Durian Festival portion of the buffet, it was clear the desserts were going down a treat. It is a great place for a lunch gathering as the noise died down after 1:30PM. I will try it again for dinner time, but I am missing everything traditional about the hotel . .

June to August durian season so naturally goodwood Park Hotel has the durian feast. Dinner $42++for 3 course plus durian buffet. Choose from satay, kueh pei, tahu goreng and chicken rice, hainaese pork chop, fish curry with prats, chicken curry with prata then dessert nonya kueh, bread pudding, fruit, ice cream 6-7 types of durian dessert green bean, sweet potatosoup. The satay serving is only two stick and kueh pei ti is only two pieces. If u order the fish curry u get a small bowl small pc of fish and rice. Guess maybe gv u more room for dessert. Instead of coffee and tea we request for mint tea which is chargeable after negotiating the manager or capt a guy that wore a suit trade with us to a pots of mint tea which is very. Good. Have not gone there for more than two years,, still. Quite a nice place to din

It's quite a famous place for Teochew porridge and they do this ala carte style. So you get freshly cooked dishes. It's of course pretty expensive. I mean you can eat for two twice for the price of one person at this buffet. But it's got a pretty good spread, the silken tofu with Japanese sauce and pork floss was really nice. The spring onion beef was tender. And if you order the fish, I think it's quite worth it then. Right now for a limited period, they have this durian desserts included in the buffet but they have upped the price to cover it of course. You can't have it excluded so I find that a bit of a bah humbug situation given not everyone wants anything to do with the durian (note you will not smell it while you eat). Best to book, this place is pretty packed on the weekends

Goodwood Park Coffee Lounge is the setting for breakfasts but also lunch/evening dining. We had breakfasts there (very comprehensive and with menus for all tastes) and also a local cuisine lunch - the Laksa Singapura and the Hokkien Chicken rice are to die for - and very well priced!

I remembered Goodwood Hotel servicing one of the best porridge in the days of old and I am talking about more than 15 years ago. It's a fav joint for many for after drinks supper. However, it is a disappointment having tried their buffet dinner last evening. It was really nothing to shout about. I don't remember a dish I ate and went "woah"!!!! Very good....nope, none, sadly. Ordinary Taiwan sweet potato porridge with ordinary tasting dishes. Hence not worth the price of SGD 46 after taxes. I could get a very decent and better similar dishes in other non buffet restaurant such as Gold Leaf at Amoy. Will I return? Nope.

This is not a cheap cuppa but it is high tea at its absolute best.
Skip lunch save yourself for all the tasty offerings and you probably won't need dinner so in that respect it is good value.
Make sure you book.

Love the Taiwanese porridge served here. You can have a choice of many varieties ... Remains you of olden days food... Recommended.
5
Efficient service and unassuming with good food, nice atmosphere and comfortable. There was an expansive choice of breakfast dishes too.
5
The reputation for the Taiwan Porridge is well earned, but the Chicken Curry was also a standout for lunch. Goodwood Park is a classic location and well known by locals for the food. Service was really good - attentive but not intrusive.

we have our breakfast and the local high tea which was very enjoyable and experience for my partner to try the local food. staff are very helpful.

Ate here with family on a Sunday evening. It was busy, but still not too crowded. We went for the Taiwanese porridge buffet which costs $39++ per person (kids 0-5 years old eat free). The variety is good, every dish that came was well cooked. The price includes access to the dessert buffet. The service however could be improved - we had to call for service several times and the kid's plate came without utensils - and the service staff still forgot them after I asked for it. Not what I expected of service at a 5-star hotel. Water was free flowing however, we were served well in that area.

When visiting Singapore several times a year, we usually stay at the Goodwood Park. Among other reasons, the Hotel’s Coffee Lounge serves some remarkably good local cuisine, although it is more famous for its Taiwanese porridge. A good test of an establishment is their Singapore Laksa which, if well prepared, is a wonderful blend of Malay and Chinese styles. Aficionados will go a long way to compare Laksa and exchange notes as to where it is best. Our personal preference at present is for the Coffee Lounge (although you do need to tell the cook to make sure that the soup is not, not lukewarm). The dish here has all the ingredients of the classic Singapore Laksa with the usual side bowl of sambal for those who like it spicy. Roaming around the other local dishes, the Sate, the Fish Curry and the Chicken Curry were all well up to par. If you are staying at the Goodwood Park or even not too far away, the Coffee Lounge is well worth a visit. The service is also excellent

Went for dinner here with two other friends on a weekday evening. The food is good but not exceptional. Service staff is attentive and tries to accommodate a vegetarian (meatless) request but maybe the chef was the one who got it wrong. Because of the upcoming festive season there were 'festive' desserts but the selection was limited. Overall be prepared to pay for the food (which is not spectacular) and the 'classy' ambience. You might be better off at a regular Teo chew porridge place if you are not one for the hotel restaurant ambience.

In the context of the Goodwood Park Hotel, the Coffee lounge is a rather middle of the road place with middle of the road food. We were there for a business dinner. Service was unattentive, and the waitress needed explanations on everything. The noodle dishes were nothing special, and the sateh was so-so. An uninspired and uninspiring place. SHame because the rest of the hotel and previous experience at the Chinese restaurant are really good
4
Located at Goodwood park hotel Singapore, 22 Scotts Rd, The décor of Coffee Lounge is an ingeniously style heritage building. At only $28US ($39 Local currency), this is one of the best Taiwan Porridge A La Carte Buffet, which offers unlimited orders of 31 favorites from the main a la carte menu, accompany with hot bowls of watery rice porridge or sweet potato porridgeThe desserts have no WOW factors, choices are limited, unimpressive and taste average
2
The service was very poor. They were understaffed and most of the guys in suits were too busy looking busy to tend to any customer requirements. Tables were dirty and left unset. Sloppy.
5
Best place to chill with friends,excellent food,surroundings.
and informed, genuine staff!!!! the pool is splendid, as is the second pool nearby! location cannot be beaten, next door to all local delicacies and exciting shopping!!!

We went to this place for porridge buffet for lunch today. Tried out a new dish I think, the one recommended by the waitress, but then the meat is a bit too hard. The seabass could have been cooked much more tender, the fried fish also did not taste good. Other than that, we had vegetables, black pepper beef, cai bu dan (my favourite), eggplant with minced meat, peanuts etc. These are delicious. And we were allowed unlimited servings of porridge, which is huge in portion. Their dessert buffet is also good, a lot of varieties- mini Indonesian cakes, a selection of fruits- pineapple, watermelon, papaya and honeydew; and a few other assorted choices of desserts. I tried their tart which was not too sweet. They also have 4 choices of ice cream, which included coffee and mint etc. The only disappointment is that my mom's membership card expired in end of December last year (2015) already, so the waiter said she could not use the card; though by right, the card is only applicable to a-la-carte menu and not buffet. They also could not check whether my mom had spent a minimum of $400 in the past one year, so that the membership could be renewed

So it's nice to go to hawker centers for the Teochew porridge but sometimes one feels like a nicer environment and sometimes there are just dishes that aren't always there. This is a nice alternative especially for the chilled tou fu with meat floss which you can't always find in the hawker centres.Of good value is their porridge and desert buffet - especially if you like durians. But now that we can't eat so much, a la carte dishes suit us better. Besides the chilled toufu, the other dish I like is the minced pork platter.
3
We were a little disappointed with the breakfast during our stay at the hotel. The variety was very limited. There was not much change for the two days we had breakfast there too. Fortunately, breakfast was included in the hotel booking. Otherwise, I would be upset for paying so much for such variety

The last time I was at Coffee Lounge was a few years ago, when I went to take the hi tea buffet. This time, I decided to try the a la carte porridge buffet, and given that Goodwood Park Hotel is also having the durian buffet this month, decided to try that too.The porridge buffet is famous for this hotel - many people will come to try this out. In fact, I could not book a table for this buffet the first time I tried - I had to try for an alternate date. It shows just how popular this place is.You get to choose the dishes you want to order for the porridge buffet. The chef will then prepare your dishes. So this is distinctive from other porridge buffets (where you will choose from the dishes available and take from them - sometimes the dishes are cold, or left there for too long). I like the pork belly dish, the stir fried beef, and the vegetables. Those are really nice when you eat with the sweet potato porridge. Don't order the salted eggs - they don't taste yummy with the porridge (a little cold, in my opinion). We tried the fried taman fish, which is good! You can only order one seafood dish in the buffet - so it's either the steamed sea bass or the fried garoupa. We order the steamed sea bass, which was de-boned by the chef - there isn't much effort to remove bones and all before eating the fish.The durian dessert buffet was a letdown for me though. Maybe my expectations were too high - I was expecting as many as 10 different durian dessert varieties. Not that there isn't good dishes. The durian mousse cake was good, as is the durian cappuccino cake. The durian puff was generously filled with durian paste, while younger kids would like the durian macaroon. Maybe I had assumed the wrong things about the chef, that they can come up with many variants of durian dessert to try. But I must say the D24 durian ice cream (that comes with rainbow bread) is delicious!All in, the buffet by Coffee Lounge is worth a try. But do bear in mind what you are coming in for. The prices are not that cheap, but compared to buffet places within the city, are already cheaper by a little. An adult will pay about $49++ for both porridge and durian buffet. A child will be half price

For nearly two decades I have been a regular. I go there once almost every time I visit Singapore and have never ever been disappointed. I always order the Singaporean fish curry although the Chinese porridge, mee siam and the Hainanese Chicken Rice seem to be as good. The place is full of locals - always a good sign - so a booking is recommended. Prices are very reasonable and the buffet is s good choice if you are so inclined

We were here for porridge buffet in celebration of my niece's 1st year birthday.The place has an old but nice, relaxing modern nostalgic environment. But the food is average both in varities & quality.Just like most hotel's cafes.Service is a little slow as they took awhile to serve the orders. If you want 'old' hotel in a modern relaxing atmosphere, there aren't many around like here. But if good food is your priority, don't bother to come here
3
The food and service was good but unfortunately the minimalist decor has robbed Goodwood Park Hotel from its beautiful architectural heritage. Perhaps it is the time of the night (about 9.30 p.m) but the atmosphere at Goodwood Park and its restaurants felt stale and sad. So sorry to see this institution which was once one of my favorite hotels now at this mood.

I was here for lunch buffet, not much crowd and was pretty quick to get serve. Took a while to get the food order and seems everyone are busy. No doubt it is a buffet lunch, u should get all in one order. I have problem getting my second order as either I could see anyone or I was ignore. Caught one serving with a suit, he told me he will attend to me later but did not come. Took me great pain to lock my second and third order. Food was ok, fresh and less oily. Not much variety for a lunch buffet but I like the nonya desert presented. Overall an average experience but not recommend to return.
5
We had high tea here on the day we arrived and it was wonderful. Plenty to choose from both Asian and Western food and the cakes were to die for. The Coffee lounge has a lovely ambience about it.
4
There needs to be a review of the menu to accommodate Vegetarian guests. The quality of service is very good.

It is hard to get a good coffee in Singapore & this cafe stood out .Fabulous cakes rolls etc are served & was packed so good indication.No1 for us .
5
Dinner was very good. The choice was varied, different types of food. Very well cooked and excellent presentation. Service was excellent. Breakfast was quite good. a fair selection of types of food to appeal to travellers.

I like this hotel since price is fair for four star level!
Coffee is very good!
Breakfast is very good!
King size bed is very good!

So slow and sloppy! Coffee excellent though. Didn't try the food. A bit impersonal and lobby like. Service so slow which spoilt things a bit.
4
Went here for breakfast whilst staying at the hotel. Was a bit pricy but the food was very nice and the service was good.
5
The food was very fresh, variety magnificent and replenished frequently. We were not rushed and could linger for at least two hours.
5
I got used to this place when I lived at an apartment in the Hotel. Since, almost every trip to Singapore, I go back - not for the Taiwanese porridge or chicken rice, which are good, no doubt - for the Fish curry. Outstanding. Not quite Indian and not Noniya - just the cooks own recipe. A bit on the heavy side but once every trip I don't mind being spoilt. Curry lovers - go there

Whilst working over the weekend, I had the opportunity to try the buffet selection at the Coffee Lounge. Its ongoing promotion is the Taiwan Porridge A La Carte Buffet. Highly affordable, I enjoyed an unlimited serving of porridge, various accompanying dishes as well as dessert. One gets to choose from a vast array of dishes, categorized into appetizers, eggs, beancurd, chicken, pork, beef, seafood and vegetables. I would recommend ordering a dish from each category. That should set you up for a very filling first round. If you are up for more, you can then order other dishes from the different categories. Simple dishes like Fried Omelette with Radish (Chye Poh), SautÃ©ed Chicken with Dried Chicken, Wok Fried Beef with Black Pepper and Steamed Sea Bass with Crispy Bean Paste are tasty. A good mix of local and international desserts such as Red Bean Soup, Bread and Butter Pudding and Nonya Kueh, among others; ended the satisfying meal.The tables and seats are spaciously laid out within the restaurant and the lighting is sufficiently bright without being too harsh. Opt for the booth seats. Nothing beats having a comfortable seat with delicious food
5
Best breakfast in Singapore? Fantastic food and very helpful staff. Brings you hot coffee of the best sort.
4
Only had one poor experience with the service on one morning during my stay but the general standard was first class service and food
5
Had lunch there on 14 july. Good quality selection of ala carte buffet. Dessert Buffet was limited though. Cost: ~$220 for 4 pax.
Service was prompt and pleasant, especially by Wilfred Yeung, one of the waiters.

Coffee is excellent in Singapore and if you want to relax or just spend some time off your feet, then visit the Coffee Lounge, you will not be disappointed.

Had our Mother's Day celebration luncheon here, have to say the ambience was great, not too crowded had very good service from the staff, they were attentive and was always smiling and giving attention to my 18 month old whenever they walked by. The laksa and Mee Siam was brilliant!! I truly enjoyed this two local delights, however the spread was not that much. I felt that they should include chocolate or their famed durian flavoured ice cream, there was only 3 flavours.The last part that was confusing was that we were offered chrysanthemum tea, but I was sure that we were not informed that it was chargeable. We were shocked to have been charged $36 for it. It would have been a perfect experience if they had waived this off considering the amount we spent for 8 adults
5
Perfect place for the meal... my dinners, breakfast used to be done here and it was just great. The staff namely Chong served us in a group extremely efficiently.. catered for Veg which I am as per my acquired taste upon order. Very accommodating and super friendly.. Everyone are very helpful and the food was delicious... mouth watering shall I say.. from appetizers to main to variety of desserts to choose from.. loved all my meals for the 1 week stay at the hotel.

As a way to celebrate the end of the year, my husband suggested my mom try this place for high tea, since she has just recovered from gout, and there is a lot of things that she is not allowed to eat. The service attitude of the staff could have been a tad bit better. As we entered the restaurant, the lady at the door insisted to my mom that the buffet high tea was $62 per pax, as it was New Year's Eve. My mom said it was okay, but my mom was slightly unhappy as did the staff thought that we could not afford to pay for it? Otherwise, she should have just write $62 at the door, instead of asking every guest that entered the restaurant. There was a great variety of food: Indonesian gado gado, fried rice, fried chicken wings, curry chicken, mini egg rolls, satay etc. By the time that I went to get the satay, it ran out; I asked the cook at the station, and he quickly went to the kitchen to get it. Though I asked only for 3 sticks, he was generous enough to give me half a dozen, and brought it to my table. The wild mushroom soup was really yummy too. There was also a whole variety of desserts, which just suited my husband, who is a dessert lover. :):):
5
The place is conducive and the high tea buffet spread is great. My husband and i love the laksa, curry chicken and fried chicken wings. It a nice and comfortable place to indulge in once in a while. We would frequent the place whenever we feel like giving ourselves a small threat. The staff are very friendly and their service is excellent! Good place, good food and good environment :

My mom suggested that we came to this restaurant for my husband and my 9th wedding anniversary on Thursday night. We ordered the following: 1.) Seabass- the fish was deboned and it was nice. 2.) Japanese tofu with pork floss- it was very delicious 3.) Salty egg with salty fish- it was not too salty, just right to the taste 4.) Egg with Chye Poh- it was much better than the home cooked one made by my mom 5.) Preserved mustard (mui cai) with minced pork- the mui cai was only so so, my mom's home cooked one is definitely much better than it. 6.) Fried kai lah- very delicious, definitely 1 of the best dishes that I had 7.) Black pepper sauce with beef- I would complain that the beef slices were a bit too big though 8.) Pork- it was tender and soft 9.) Tofu with Pork- the tofu was so yummy We got unlimited servings of sweet potato porridge and also we can order unlimited items from the buffet menu, with the exception of fish, which each table is allowed to 1 serving only. Half of the buffet was durian, and it suited my husband a lot as he is a keen durian lover. The only downside is that if you want to come to this place in the weekends, you will have to call a few days in advance, as otherwise you won't even be able to get a table at all. Once, we came here quite late on a Sunday, close to their buffet closing time, as we finished church late, and the waiter told us to order from the ala-carte menu instead. The only thing is that the buffet was not cheap, it cost about $50 per person, excluding GST.When we ordered the second time, the service was a bit slow though, and the waiter actually forgot that my mom ordered the 3rd bowl of sweet potato porridge. :

My friend and I had the Taiwan Porridge a-la-carte dinner Buffet ($38++ excluding drinks) on 22 Feb 2013. It includes the dessert buffet (ice-cream, fruits, pastries & kueh).We loved the smooth silky sweet potato porridge (unlimited servings). We ordered the following: -1) steamed sea bass – it was de-boned and it was divine2) beancurd in Japanese soya sauce & pork floss – it was a good combination3) fried omelette with chye poh – the egg was thick & luscious. Goes well with the chilli sauce4) mui choy (preserved mustard) with pork – the mui choy was swimming in a bowl but tastes all right. Pork slices were tiny.5) wok-fried beef with black pepper – it was not bad, maybe we were too full.6) Taiwan sausages – I was expecting it to be sliced but they came in 4 small bite sized sausages7) stir fried kailan - good.We like the a-la-carte idea. Dishes are cooked upon order so that they arrived piping hot on your table and the presentation of the food will not be compromised.After the food, we were so full to attack the dessert buffet but we couldnt resist the Movenpick ice cream.The restaurant setting was classy. We sat from 6:40pm till closing (10:30pm).We were seated at a 2-seater table which was too small for all the dishes that we had ordered. The restaurant was not full so they could have seated us at the 4-seater table instead (we made reservations in advance). The waiting staff need to take more initiative in clearing our tables and changing side plates
