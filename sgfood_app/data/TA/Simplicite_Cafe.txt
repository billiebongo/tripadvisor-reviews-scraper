Simple, clean, and cosy. Good breakfast and brunch options. Try New York eggs. Good wifie. Friendly and attentive staff. They need to fix the front door though :-)

We were having dinner at the famous Lor 29 across the street when we spot this cute place. We decided to have brunch here the next day.The place is tiny, there are only a few tables inside and outside.The owner and staffs were very attentive.Food looked really great and the taste was also great.They leave a bottle of water with glasses in every table for customers. There are lemon slices inside the water. Have fun drinking healthy detox water and prepare your appetite for brunch :)Would not hesitate to recommend this brunch spot to everyone

I've been there twice. Very good ice cream! My favourite flavour is when Ms Rose meets Mr lemon - fresh soury lemon and lovely rose scent and taste. You just need to try it yourself. Ps: they are not opened everyday. Only Thursday and Friday evenings, and whole day Saturday and Sunday if I'm not mistaken.

We were looking for dessert after having some hokkien mee nearby and happened to come across this cafe. Adrian Tan, the store's co founder, was very friendly and shared some of the history behind how the treats were made. We tried a few samples, including sea salt caramel and My Blushing Lady and My Fair Lady, comprising mercato and strawberries and mercato and cream respectively. But it was the When Ms Rose Meets Mr Lemon sorbet that was the standout, and which made us order a waffle.They have a couple of waffle options, including the blossom - a couple of dollars more - which is shaped like a flower, naturally, with blueberries, sliced strawberries and whipped cream. We also had a scoop of valhorna chocolate, which was rich and thick.For those who are hungrier, they have options such as waffles and chicken, sandwiches with avocado and ham, and egg bennies and ahi poke.Service was very good and we will be back to try the other dishes. Everything was good, other than the main door that was slightly 'sticky', but Adrian was looking into the issue even as we left
