Must try the Marvellous Matcha Pancake. Think of it as an Matcha lava cake but ten times better. The pancake is filled with green tea and white chocolate. So satisfying and pretty too.
3
We thought the food was decent, but nothing spectacular given its price point. We had high hopes given that the menu sounded really interesting and we had heard good things, but it was just average.
3
First visit to the hearty bases restaurant. Food was great but countered staff couldnt be bothered to explained the different types of add on base.
4
Ordered the pulled pork pancakes and its yummy and filling! Definitely worth ordering. Will try out the salad bowls on the next visit!
2
Maui Dreams was presented in the form of croissant with burnt (black) edges. Definitely unacceptable
2
The menu sounded very interesting but our meal turned out rather disappointing. My side of kale salad was watery and tasteless. One of my dining companion’s mea was served at least 15min before mine.
Probably will not return
4
I tried the Unagi burger, which was filling, though I wished the sweet potato fries were thicker. The ones I had were a bit dry. I also had their tea cake.
Prices are exclusive of GST
5
It is my first time dining at Ninja Cut. The restaurant is accessible and the staffs are friendly. Ordered Oceans of Mentaiko & Marvellous Matcha. Oceans of Mentaiko was not bad. It is cream base, however the sauce was light. Marvellous Matcha was good initially, however I think it would be better to share among 3 - 4 people as dessert instead of having it as one of the mains for 2 people
4
Food took some time to come but was delicious! The truffle fries were crispy on the outside and moist on the inside. The Yuzu-marinated Salmon PokÃ© was good, though I felt it should have come with quinoa/rice as a basic ingrediant, rather than have to add it on for $3. As it is, the basic dish without addons for $19 was on the steep side
4
We ordered Unagi burger and Salmon 2-ways. Both were nice. Unagi burger came with sweet potato fries...taste better than usual potato fries...taste less guilty. For drinks, we had iced mocha n hot coffe with milk. Iced mocha is good as the sweet chocolate is left at the bottom, not stirred. Good for me who prefer less sweet. But the hot coffee taste funny..think is the milk they used. Overall good..though bit pricy.
3
Went in with high expectations and was disappointed. Average tasting food in small portions. Overpriced.
5
good service and quality of food. service crew was polite and explains the menu every time i visit. Casual dinning and good coffee brings my mood up everytime.
3
Felt that the the options weren't as nice as Ninja bowl, their sister cafe. Standard wasn't quite up there either. Pricey meal. Would recommend going to Ninja bowl instead.
5
The place is spacious as the table layouts are not close to each other. A good place for a small gathering with friends.
3
The restaurant was very accommodating to our large group, kudos for that. Food was good but cold pumpkin seems a strange combination with the other dishes
5
Good with kids ! Casual place : ) we had hot cheeks, oceans of Hokkaido, beef soba ... everything is so good
4
Nice ambience, healthy and yummy food and located at a 5 mins walk from the mrt. Worth recommending friends to visit the place.
3
We were seated quickly and food arrived quite promptly as well. Portions could have been bigger for the price.
3
Food was good and the place is really convenient. We actually told them in the reservation that we were celebrating a birthday, but no special arrangement was made.
3
With high expectation from my visit at Ninja bowl, i recommended my friends here. A few of us had the pulled pork which was too salty which covered the taste of the other ingredients. We had the stool at the long table which wasnt that comfortable to chat there for long hours
5
Excellent choice of food and all healthy and fresh ingredients !! We love it and will definitely come again.
4
Ordered the salmon bowl and it was really good! It’s pricey though, I wouldn’t frequent the place. Nice ambience too!
5
The food not only tasted great, the plating was gorgeous. It is hard to find a cafe like Ninjacut which serves up innovative yet great tasting food these days. Hats of to the owners and chefs!
5
Simply love the food here. Was delighted that portion was quite big and satifying. The food quality of the food there and well cooked. Would return again and love the design of the space too.
3
We ordered the pulled pork w/ soba and there was just too much sauce from the soba and the coleslaw and the pork that mixed together and it became too overwhelming.
4
Delicious! Came a few times for dinner and lunch. Very satisfied. Portions can be slightly bigger though
3
Went there for lunch and the first surprise that it accepts cash/Nets payment only where this is not a cheap place to dine. I ordered the beef soba but it taste more like a salad dish.
4
Friendly staff with warm service. I highly recommend ordering Oceans of Mentaiko. The broth was absolutely savory and made for a great starter.
4
Food is served promptly and the flavours are good. Squid fix, beef cheek and the chicken breast all taste great. Service staff are attentive and helpful. There is no crowd on a Wednesday night, nice ambience for a close gathering :)
5
First review but I’ve been there at least 5 times over the past few months; and I don’t live or working in that area. Good quality incredients and selection. They pay attention to the presentation which adds to the overall positive dining experience. Not cheap, but considering what you get it’s reasonable. I wish the tools and tables could be bigger... esp for a big 6 footer like me. Overall will visit again and will recommend friends.
2
We had the diner’s choice which came with a mentaiko starter and a main. Thought the starter was really good but the main was just so so.
4
Love the food and deco. They update their menu nw and then so there’s always some new stuff to try. Mostly busy during lunch so make reservation before you go.
3
I honestly thought the food was overrated and not fantastic at all. It was actually really disappointing. :(
4
Was greeted with enthusiastic and passionate service staff who has absolute attention on our needs. Impressive service with tasty food!
3
The food was interesting.... never had anything like this kinda cuisine. Beef was good but the serving portion was small.
The decor was simple and nice. Only thing I didn’t like was the tiny tables. It made the dinner feel very cramped....
3
Both food and service are good, but all the dishes are overpriced. I would be a regular customer if the prices are halved. I could whip up the same dishes at home at a quarter of the current price.
4
Small place but good ambience. Great food with good service though self order & pay. Look forward to new additions to the menu though some mentioned on blogs were not available already when I visit.
5
Bought chope’s $19.90 set menu and had the oceans of mentaiko and pulled pork bowl. Both were good! The seafood in the former were fresh and the pulled pork was nicely cooked. The appetiser was a tad salty though. Also, the price without the set menu promo would be less value for money.
4
there's an update to the menu which is good. always something new to try. tried the salmon with brioche but the brioche was thick and non fluffy which became a big turn off. salmon was good though. water that's available wasn't cold, tasted stale and disgusting.
4
Ordered The Hot Cheek and was pleasantly surprised at how soft yet juicy the beef cheek was. The sides completed the dish well enough that the base wasn’t really needed! The sweet potato fries was another stunner, who thought that marshmallows and mentaiko could go so well together.
4
My 1st time here was good!!! The beef was so shiok! Love the ambience of the restaurant too! Good place to hang out and chill.
4
Healthy lunch option, the only down side about this place is the a/c, its never cold during lunch hour. Other than that, food's great.
4
Really fresh tasty food with lots of choice. Would definitely recommend it for lunch and hanging out with friends
4
Attentive service staff who makes genuine food recommendations. Not quite a common sight in Sg. Drinks come in a really huge cup that's good to share for two and value for money.
4
We go to ninja cut eery fortnight and the food is usually very good but we dropped by on a Friday and it was crowded and the food standard was not to par so we are disappointed. Matcha pancakes was too sweet
4
Was disappointed as we thought that 'Oh my Cod' and the roasted pork is available in the menu but unfortunately they have changed their menu and the menu that we read from CHOPE isn't the same. Would hope that the cod fish dish and roast pork dish will be back to the menu. We will definitely patronize again
3
food took quite a while to arrive, but quality of food is good, albeit slightly pricey. the restaurant is a nice cosy place that can get a little too loud, you'll need to strain your ears to pick up what your friend is saying on the other side of the table
5
We had lunch here, the food is an interesting twist of Asian Euro mix (if that makes sense!). Healthy and great for a quick lunch, I particularly enjoyed their roasted cauliflower, itâ€™s served like a pizza with a Japanese dressing - yummy! It was very busy and we were lucky to get a table - packed full of very happy looking diners! Apart from the great food, I also really enjoyed the trendy vibe. I will go back!
3
My visit was near the closing time of the outlet. I am not sure why it closes so early at 6pm. The raw fish did not taste as fresh (since it was closing time?) and the portion was measly at average taste. Definitely overpriced!!! We had but had to top up with another dinner at 8pm somewhere else
4
I usually have my lunch at 2:30pm because I have a bit to eat at 11am. So the crowd was minimal at that time. The bowl was generous but was disappointed with the serving of the additional greens (extra $2 to make it a salad). Tasty and healthy. Price was reasonable.
4
Nice roast beef ribeye accompanied by carrots, sautéed mushrooms and corn kernel. I ordered their ninja rice to go along with this. Very filing and tasty. And I think healthier too :)
Make sure you have a reservation as it gets crowded on weekends.
3
Food there was good and pretty affordable! drinks were super generous too unlike other cafes. other than that, service wasn;t really good and there was almost no airconditioning in the cafe. dress light!
4
Had the Waikiki salmon, was good. Space was a little squeezy and can be noisy if dining with other groups
5
The new selection is indeed surprising to the taste buds,especially cha-wan-mushi,potato rosti and oceans of mentaiko
4
Tried their new menu! Had mackerel while my friends had beef cheek. As usual the carrots were roasted to perfect sweetness, and each dish always had a good balance of raw and cooked vegetables.
5
Great food and great ambience! Staff were quick to respond to our needs without being too instruive:)
4
My friends and I ordered the two beef bowls and the salmon poke bowl. We liked the beef bowls, but it was on the saltier side. The poke bowl was average. Nice place to chill with friends :)
1
I ordered on of the bowls over the weekend but wasnt informed that one of the ingredients (which i craved for) was unavailable before payment was made. it wasnt made known to the diner when the dish was served. I came to realise the ingredient i craved was missing when i was about to start eating. Therefore, i went to the counter to clarify and the answer i got was that they ran out the ingredient for that day. I was utterly dissappointed that such comments should be made earlier before payment is made? In addition, an exchange for the ingredient (not dish) can only be made after further request. I think they will need to improve their service training to their staff.
2
We ordered the truffle fries and it tasted so salty. We provided our feedback and the waitress offered us ketchup to cover over the saltyness. ??? Seriously. They finally replaced another one for us but I believe they just flip the fries around and gave it back to us in a new bowl. The rest of the bowls we ordered were okay. Everything was cold or at room temperature.
2
We had the highly raved What's Your Beef and #Crispygoals. The Beef was thin, dry and tasteless- cooked to a very well done. The sides accompanying it (corn, carrots, mushrooms), tasted like microwaved food, similar to airplane food. We had the soba with it, and it was soggy and tasted stale.The roasted pork belly was good, however, the quinoa we ordered was cold. As a restaurant, we expected freshly prepared food. However, the food was a disappointment, and although i was unable to stomach it, my boyfriend helped me finish it as it was a pricey meal. I would rather go to daily cut, for the cheaper options that taste so much better
4
Had the wakiki surf and the beef cheeks. Truffle fries too. All decent portions and pretty tasty too.
4
Ambience and food here was good. Recommend the what's your beef dish. Truffle fries there was fragrant as well!
4
Good service from the staffs..and very attentive. The drinks are good and the beef are good too..but the serving of the food are small
3
Food is overpriced for the amount they gave, can be improved. However, had a great time with my friends there because service staff was polite and friendly.
5
Food is great, service is prompt. I like the wide selection available for choices, and am happy with my salmon bowl!
4
Food was great and the staff were very friendly. Pork was tender and nice. Portion was good for one too!
5
I really enjoyed my meal at this cafe, the food was healthy and very delicious! Strong recommend to order their What's Your Beef!
3
The place was easy to get to with parking lots available by the roadside. Food was presented in a nice layout. It is healthy however abit pricey for the portion as there's an additional top up of $2-$3 for rice, soba or quinoa. It would have been quite plain if there wasn't any top up. The price could be lowered to fit its portion being served.
4
We went in a group of 6 of us so we ordered quite a few dishes. The one with the seafood mentaiko totally blown me away. The rest of the dishes we ordered was just also equally good as well on the above average side. We went on a weekdays so it's not crowded and just nice. Heard from friends the weekend is quite horrible so skip the restaurant over the weekend if you want a nicer experience! Verdict....definitely will go again....But maybe not so often cos not cheap
4
Love their flat white. Ordered Oceans of Mentaiko & What's your beef with Soba. Both tasted amazing. For dessert we ordered matcha lava pancake, which I think was just alright. The pancake portion was huge so definitely need 3 people to share after each having a main course
5
Revisit the cafe after revised menu,had "don't cha wan mu shi".food quality is as per reviewed and service well maintained
4
Was there forcthe matcha hotcakes and like it a lot. Overall food was good and staff services were good.
4
Kaya toast is a must order! I had white pear ginger. It was awesome. The smell of the ginger was covered by the pear. Taking a bit of ginger is great for health. Definitely be back again!
4
Food is tasty yet healthy. Just the seats not as comfortable with no backing. Table is small but good enough
3
Our order took very long despite not too many diners when we were there. The food portion very small and taste so so only.
5
Great restaurant despite reading some negative comments before our visit therr. Love the food definitely, they had the best matcha pancake that I've ever had. Nicely decorated too :)
3
Location is easy, place is spacious. Would be better if cashier had more smiles. The beef macaroni had a weird aftertaste and we didnt enjoy it at all. Crab rosti is soggy/oily.
4
Food was delicious but a little pricey though. Definitely a place worth indulging in once in a while :)
3
The food was not bad. And the portion was just nice for us. We ordered the waikiki surf (salmon avocado cherry tomatoes onsen egg ) and top up soba for 2$ to share. Another dish was sweet potato fries (mentaiko cream with torched marshmallow bacon bits and melted cheese
4
This was our third visit and we specially headed down to try the new items in the menu. The Beefy Patty Macaroni was homely and comforting, while the Crab Rosti was the star of the night as the many ingredients on the plate complemented each other well. The Kaya Toast, on the other hand, was quite underwhelming as there was too much bread and too little ice cream
4
The place was less crowded than expected, they were kind enoug to offer an earlier time slot for us. Food was ok but a little pricey.
4
Healthy and inspiring food! Especially love their desserts! Will definitely visit again! Highly recommended!
3
Good Coffee, Menu Choices and Ambiance - had the beef and thought that it was quite tough for my liking
3
Conveniently located in between City Hall & Bugis, the Ninja Cut serves hearty and healthy Japanese influenced delights. Their pork belly is pretty good and worth a try 😝
4
Love the wakiki salad bowl 😍 the combination is uique with avocado, egg and salmon. For more stuffing meal, can add some carb
3
The one very delicate food item off the entire menu is the.... marvellous matcha! Full of greatness and excellent combinations of different flavors to challenge and tempt your taste bud. You should not leave without ordering this.
4
I personally feel it is slightly pricey. The drinks are averagely $8. We order 3 main, 1 cauliflower and 3 non-alcohol drinks totaled to $90+.
3
Most of the food was not too bad. Love the sweet potato fries. Had a nice twist with the marshmallow. But I won't recommend getting the dontchawansomemushi. Everything in it was overcooked and mushy.
5
The food feels very healthy. But at the same time, they do serve comfort food like truffle fries and cakes. Overall experience is good!!
5
Had the matcha pancake and the pulled pork bowl. Shared both with a friend. Nice ambience, cosy for catching up. Quite expensive though I think.
4
The food is wholesome and healthy. Especially love the steakbowl with mushrooms, carrots and corn. The huge matcha lava dessert is a little too sweet for me.
4
Great option for healthy food bowls. Atmosphere and food presentation was wonderful. Look forward to trying desserts the next time!
3
Food was pretty decent, with small servings. However, it was too crowded and hence noisy for a gathering.
4
Enjoyed the grilled cheese toast and braised beef cheek, although the beef cheek was a tad too salty on it's own. Kaya toast was surprisingly scrumptious as well! Squid fix was so-so, noodles that we added-on was even more meh.
4
Love the food as usual especially the Squid Fix and Marvelous Matcha. These are both my staples. Also got to try the crab rosti and truffle fries which are my new favorites.
5
Food was good. Staffs were friendly and nice. Nice ambience to hang out. A good place to chillax. Will visit again.
4
Food was good, I ordered the crab rosti. Egg was perfectly cooked as well. The gf ordered the Holy Mackerel. Nice ambiance too! Will return here again!
5
Food standard is equally as good as Ninja Bowl, service is impeccable. Also love the space available, much more easier to move around. However, I find the size of the bowls smaller than Ninja Bowl. I'm a small eater but I can finish the entire portion by myself.
3
Went to Ninja Cut after seeing good reviews but was disappointed by the average taste of the food. Ordered the Ninja Steak & Eggs but the taste was average and nothing special. The beef was cooked medium and was red. My friend ordered the rosti and he complaint that it was oily. We also ordered the grilled cauliflower but it tasted normal.
5
The place to go to for a healthy meal. I like how you can mix and match by ordering different bases (eg quinoa or salad) to accompany the various mains. Good value for money. Only negative comment is we ordered the grilled cauliflower and you could tell there was mould that the kitchen should have shaved off
2
Honestly speaking, the plating of the food is instaworthy. However, there is still room for improvement on the taste of the food. Not forgetting, the portion can be bigger as it is too small.
5
Food was delicious and the cafe atmosphere was great for conversation, though the price is a little steep
4
Food was good, ordered the crab rosti. Egg was perfectly cooked as well. Nice ambience. Food was slightly pricey though. Feel that it's not exactly worth $18 for the portion.
5
Food was very nice, affordable and delicious. Atmosphere was pretty good too, will go back again for more
3
The chicken tenders were really tender and great. However, the rosti was too oily and I felt the poached egg didn't go well with the rosti.
5
Visited this cafe for dinner with a friend after reading many good reviews about Ninja Cut, and we were not disappointed. We ordered the Waikiki Surf, Marvellous Matcha and You Seoul Sweet to share. All the dishes were uniquely awesome. They weren't just great on the palate, but looked good on the plate as well.If there is 1 negative thing I must comment on, it would be the price here is a bit on the high side, considering the portion. That's probably the price to pay for great food in a cosy ambience in such a centralised location, I guess. Nonetheless, Ninja Cut is definitely worth a visit
4
Ninja cut had recently revamped their menu, with the launch of a few new dishes. Ordered the crab rosti, kaya mochi french toast, you seoul sweet (battered rice cakes with peanut butter, miso caramel sauce and ricotta cheese) and sweet potato fries (with toasted marshmallows, melted cheese, mentaiko and bacon bits). The crab rosti was my favourite of all, certainly worth the 30 min wait (as they had sold out of it when we arrived). The rosti is stuffed with cheese, pan fried to a crisp exterior and served with fresh crabmeat pate and a perfectly poached eggs. The kaya mochi cheese french toast was a unique sweet-savoury dessert that boosted an interesting combination of kaya, mochi and cheese within two thick, soft and fluffy brioche. It also came with a mini scoop of salted mascarpone ice-cream and crumbles. As for the sides - sweet potato fries and you seoul sweet, i personally prefer the former that turns out to be an addictive one for me.
1
I made reservation and requested for baby chair and the staffs there arranged a high table for me. When I requested whether I could change to an empty table that I saw which was not occupied, she rejected me straight in the face with a firm NO and said that it's already been taken without waiting for me to finish my sentence and walk away. The chairs at the high table do not have anything to lean back on obviously it's definitely not suitable for kids to sit! Moreover my friend's Son is only 2yr old. Another staff then came over to us because we were figuring how her Son could fit in that high chair. When the staff finally realised that the baby chair is too short for the high table, she got embarrassed herself and offered to change us a table. 45mins passed and she obviously forgot about changing a table and we manage to change ourselves when we saw a group of 6 left the table. Food wise I won't comment much but it cost us about $200 for 6mains and 6coffee. This will be my first and last time going to ninja cut as I hate restaurant with bad service attitude! Singapore has too many new restaurant that serve brunch food so if you want your restaurant to survive and make sure customers come back, please increase your level of service standard
1
Disappointing experience. Order the chawan don mushi, and waited for almost half an hour. When we asked the server the reason for the delay, then i was informed that the item was already out of stock. Come on, your kitchen should communicate with your servers right then they can inform the customers and not waiting for the customers to have a never ending wait for the food that will never come. In fact i think they don't deserve no grades at all for the overall rating.
3
Simple deco, no frills cafe with not much ambience and little too cramp and noisy. Food portion a little too small. Would say, expensive for the portion, even after considering the ingredients used. Only plus point is that combi of the ingredients to make up each dishes are pretty interesting. Worth trying once, I would say. But thereafter, don't think I'll go back again.
3
I had the beef bowl and coconut mint drink. The beef was tough but I liked the mushroom and corn. The drink was alright.
3
Food was served quite promptly and taste was good. Need to make a reservation for the weekend as the place may be crowded.
4
A good array of menu choices for brunch, lunch or dinner with no GST or service charge. But felt that my food could have been served warmer instead of lukewarm.
3
Despite having no service charge, the portions were really rabbit-sized and hence considered expensive. Taste wise was OK, you know that they salt their food but was nothing out of the extraordinary. The ambience was warm despite having fans and aircon, so rather uncomfortable.
5
Food & drinks were great and portions were generous! Will return again to try other items on the menu :)
3
Food wa tasty. The service staff was good. However, I feel the truffle fries taste isn't that strong and the cold pressed was really pricey.
1
Food was quite mediocre. Ordered 1 Appetiser (Truffle Fries), 3 Mains (Beef Patty Macaroni, Potato Rosti and Dont Cha Wan Some Mushi with Scallops) and 1 Dessert (Kaya Toast) as recommended on most reviews.Only Truffle Fries and Kaya Toast is good. Rest of the food is honestly disappointing especially after hearing the raved reviews from many online.Staff were also not very friendly and welcoming. Overall, bad trip and wasted meal. Will not go back and will not recommend anyone to visit this place
3
The restaurant is relatively packed, but really clean. Made a reservation with an request and was fulfilled. Menu handed over us WITHOUT mentioning there are errors with the menu (eg Price difference/revision of $2 for some dishes). Some items were not available due to ingredients being out of stock, was only made known after the order. We were allow (or rather obliged) to change our item of an equivalent or higher value, with refund being out of the question. Overall stuff are warm and speedy in the delivery. Would advise patrons to make an effort to check if there are any items that is not available and double confirm about the pricing before placing any orders
3
Went there on a Thursday night. Ambience was good. Service was friendly. Ordered what the beef and beef patty macaroni. Beef is undercooked (less than medium rare kind), choice of beef cut is too tough for a steak. Beef patty was too salty. Food took 20 min to prepare. Fall short of my expectations.
3
We went as a group of 5 and had one bowl each plus a Marvellous Matcha to share. The 'Hello Ebi-bardy' featured prawns that were indeed plump and succulent, while the beef in 'The Hot Cheek' was tender and coated in a delicious sauce then went well with the soba. The 'Holy Mackarel', though, was slightly disappointing as the mentaiko taste didn't quite come through when paired with the strong mackerel, and there were a couple of scales left on the fish...Still, the Marvellous Matcha more than made up for it all - oozing with matcha lava from the first cut, well-balanced by the yuzu peel and azuki. THIS is worth coming back for in itself
5
Great food that cost fairly ok!
Did not add any carbo and have ordered salmon, beef, the chawanmushi dish (only one that didn't test very awesome) with the matcha dessert and a coconut drink! Life is good!
5
Interesting little restaurant, dishes a little unusual but very very delicious and filling, another great find on the chope app.
4
Convenient, just a 5 min walk from City Hall mrt. Good, value for money healthy food and I loved the matcha pancakes!
3
tried the truffle mash with char siew and waikiki bowl. the waikiki bowl is average, there are other restaurants with better salmon bowls. truffle mash was nice! the restaurant was really noisy and we could hardly hear each other. atmosphere was bad.
3
Came here on a Saturday afternoon. Service was good but can't say the same for their food. Not worth the hype imo.
4
My 4th time to ninja cut & its always a pleasant experience but it will be nice to update the menu to add more variety.
4
The food was great but I felt that the portions were slightly on the small side. Servers were really accommodating and friendly but not overly intrusive as well.
4
Grain bowls here are very tasty. I guess they value quality over quantity, which is not a bad thing, but wish they gave more grains. Went away still a little hungry.
4
Had a double date there for brunch and it's safe to say we all had a great time! Despite it being pretty busy..the counter and service staff were all really friendly! The portions of the foods we ordered were just right! It all tastes really fresh as well as nicely seasoned! I had the cheeky cheese which was Super yum!! The soft brioche bread!! and drank the coconut and lime which was thoroughly refreshing! The chicken tenders and truffle fries were yummy too! I'd definitely recommend this place for a small group/double date. Prices are pretty competitive. Ps: parking can be a pain! If you can't find street parking, i recommend you park across the street at bras basar complex than at raffles hotel! Hahah
4
The food was great and prepared jus right. Tried the soba with beef (what's your beef) and the matcha hotcakes. The hotcakes had a surprise element of yuzu admist the thick matcha sauce. Also great service as I had to check with my Friend a few times on what she would like to eat and required to walk from the counter to my table. Thankful that the counter staff caught my hint promptly to serve the surprise bday cake. Not the mention the nice bday song played
5
This is my first visit to this unique restaurant. Great food and nice place, excellent service rendered by the professional staffs. Thanks
4
I absolutely love the sweet potato fries! The whole dish was a mixture of sweet and salty, which I found myself liking it a lot. The marshmallow drizzle was something new and it went surprisingly well with the fries!
3
Went for the matcha pancakes and didn't disappoint! Mains were on the pricey side unfortunately and not the best I've had.
5
This place is great. I had steak with eggs which was yummy and a side order of roasted cauliflower which was amazing - I was really impressed! I'll be going back here, I love the young trendy vibe:)
5
When a few times and the different orders are all very nice. Keeps you full too! Service is really nice and reservation is sometime required especially if you are going during lunch time.
4
Very good choice for office lunch if you're around the area. Had the Mentaiko, it looked like a small serving when it arrived, but it filled me up eventually. Chunky scallops used. Delicious.
4
Love their rice bowls! Very well balanced and well plated. Could do with a slight reduction in price though. Also, atmosphere was too noisy and contained.
4
Had a variety of food for us to choose from. Food was served relatively quick and the food itself was tasty
4
This is the first time I visited after reading quite quickly few good reviews. It is self service and the staffs will provide guidance on what's the preferred base to have if one hv dietary preference. I would say the food is of healthy serve and good portion
4
Ninja Cut offers a variety of bowls that can be paired with carbs of your choice and each bowl is filled with a colourful mix of vegetables. We had the Char Siew Peekaboo and while the portion was small, the Japanese-style char siew was aptly marinated. We also got the sinful The Cheeky Cheese, which had beef cheeks so tender that they peel right off with a fork and fluffy grilled cheese sandwiches as accompaniment. The Marvelous Matcha is also a must-order dessert to share for matcha fans and it tastes as good as it looks as thick matcha lava flows out from the gigantic "cake"
5
Tried their oceans of mentaiko, what's your beef and marvelous matcha! Totally not disappointed. Especially loved the rich mentaiko sauce
5
Loved the mentaiko cream sauce. The beef was very good value at $18 nett as well. Highly recommend this place for a simple bur hearty meal without breaking the bank
3
Pros
(1) Nice drinks like the coconut and lime
(2) Tasty bowls with grains.
Cons
(1) Portions very small
3
Tried two of their mains - Pork belly skin was too tough, cod was dry and tasteless. Also ordered truffle fries which was overly salted.
Coconut juice was good as it was a huge glass.
3
Ordered truffle fries...not exactly the ones we like. It was slightly oily and over fried. (too crispy, gives a more biscuity feeling.) The fries was served rather late too, quite some time after we finished the main course.
1
The Mrs ordered the Salmon....returned it twice, first time for being over cooked and rubbery .30 minutes later, the dish came back with the fish being cooked only on one side, raw on the other side and was served with a side of ice cold poached eggs. For 18 bucks is it too much to expect a decently cooked piece of fish?

This was my second visit to Ninja Cut. Wanted to get the Char Siew Peekaboo initially but I was told that it wasn't available because there's no Char Siew, so I ordered the Polenta Mash but again it wasn't available since the meat used was also char siew. The staff offered to change the meat to pork belly, hence I requested for the Char Siew Peekaboo's meat to be changed to pork belly. To my dismay, the staff said no?? Like huh, why not when it can be done for the other Char Siew dish?? Reluctantly she did it for me eventually. Anyway, the pork belly was pretty good, not too fatty and oily. Ate it together with the pickled lotus root as the lotus roots were too sour and a lil spicy. The Sakura ebi, however, added a special twist to the dish as a whole. Might not return unless the service improves

went there with a friend, ordered the waikiki & the squid bowl. salmon was normal, had forgotten to add/give me the sauce meant for the dish. only gave it to me when i requested for soy sauce. squid bowl fared better, with sauce for the soba noodles and the squid was flavoured. would go back again but not anytime soon

Ambience was nice just that when I dined in there it was really humid. Food wise it is good though portion a little small. I had coconut drink and it's awesome! Love it. If it were cooler there I think it would elevate the whole dining experience

Ninja Cut is an Asian Fusion cafe tucked away in a corner of town serving one bowl meals. We ordered the "Oh my Cod", "Ready Steady Veggie" and "WaikikiSurf". The food was good but would have been much nicer if they were served hot instead of warm. The cafe also serves cold pressed juice and coffee. Would definitely come back again and try their macha dessert which we missed as we were too full

Expensive tho. Oh my cod isn't as fresh as I thought it would be. It taste like some frozen dory chunks

Love the food here as always, ordered the beef and squid. Love the beef it is tender, squid not as much. Coffee is good too

Pleasantly surprised by the delicious taste of the food. They may look simple but the taste was delicious! Prices of the food were reasonable but the drinks were kind of high.

Ambience is nice and not overly crowded by tables. Spacious. Healthy food choices which makes it a good option on days you feel like eating healthy.

Ordered the What's your beef bowl and comes with free base from reserving on Chope! Big slab of beef with healthy quinoa and vegetables! All for $18. Reasonably priced! A tad noisy during dinner hours.

Perhaps I ordered the wrong dish. I ordered the miso cod protein bowl. The cod had no miso flavour and looked like a frozen piece of fish that has been boiled to death and dried out. The rest of the dish was average. My dining partner ordered the grilled cheese and beef cheeks which was tastier than my order. Beef was fork tender and grilled cheese satisfactory. Coffee isn't too bad either. Very difficult to park in the area

The service at Ninja Cut was warm and friendly, and the food was unique and good as well! Felt really wholesome with the multiple types of grains and veggies (: The onsen egg was good as well! The highlight must be the matcha pancakes that ooze perfectly (:

I have requested a corner seat a day earlier, as my friend and me would like to have a good catch up time over lunch. However we were directed to a seat..just an usual seat.without any sign tt it is a reserved seat. Needless to say, or wasn't a corner seat. To me, they didn't take reservation request seriously. I would understand if we were late and they have to give up our seats to others. But we were not late. Food was good though
