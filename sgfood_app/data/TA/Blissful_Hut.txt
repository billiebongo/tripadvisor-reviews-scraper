The kids love these creations of jelly. Do book in advance as they do run out or just call and check before making your way down to get one to avoid disappointment.

We came for puffle pockets. I like it crispy on the outside but soft on the inside. Taste of it was good but the chocolate ice cream was too sweet for my liking. The combination with strawberry ice cream was good. Was told that the gelato was made with good quality ingredients and natural sugar(that's where the sweetness came from). When we were there, the puffle pockets are on offer, buy 2 get 1 free.i think the price is quite good but with the offer, it is even more worth it and worth the try if the offer is still on.

Amanda and Sugar have a cozy cafe tucked at the bottom of Toa Payoh block 51. Their tortizzas are a light take on the thin crust pizza. My nephew liked their spaghetti which had just enough sauce to coat the pasta well. I especially like the chocolate gelato which is on the bittersweet side of delicious. Had an enjoyable time.
