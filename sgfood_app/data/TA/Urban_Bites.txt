I‚Äôve never tried such a delicious hummus. Must try!! Reasonable price and decent portion. The service staff is so Friendly and attentive. Always checked on us. Excellent service keep it up.
4
A mixed experience. Food took ages to arrive... the place is still relatively expensive, but the food tastes good. A favourite of mine but ha become very commercial and greedy.
5
Very authentic and tasty hummus, best I have tasted in Singapore. Also tried the delicious chicken liver with pomegranate molasses, which was soft and well seasoned. Kind and attentive staff, fast service. Will definitely come back for the lunch menu. Sweets looked amazing too:)
4
They have a great lunch set, and the portion is big enough to be shared. The hummus is smooth and creamy, the kebabs are soft and flavourful.
Highly recommend to satisfy Turkish Cravings while in the CBD.

Very good chicken kebab. The dips were excellent. However the service was poor .The management needs to pay more attention to training the staff.
5
I can't fault any of the dishes that I tried being of Lebanese origin. The hummus is amazing so as the Tabbouleh. Came during lunch and it was packed. I will definitely check them out for dinner. They are generous with their portions which is always a good thing. The ambiance is really cozy and inviting. Will be coming bac

So where do I start - hmmmm!Let‚Äôs stay positive - small restaurant, but good ambience and the open plan stone oven in the corner gives a nice feel.Table size small, which I can understand but it also means I can smell neighbours food. With only 1 other couple in the restaurant at that point, I wouldn‚Äôt want to sit right next to them! Give me a table somewhere else for god sake!!!The service staff was gathered around the entrance to look at by-passers more than focusing on looking after the guests.Ordered the sharing platter and the platter size was so big that we hardly had space for a side plate through which to eat! Talk about being cozy, they took it a bit too seriously!! The other problem was that platter was too big and food too less, a perfect recipe for disaster in plate. So where will I feel value for money then??The chicken kebab we ordered next was dry slim and inadequate! With salad on side but hardly appealing. The French fries were stale and re-fried. And you thought the people coming to eat are silly.I would highly recommend anyone not to go there n waste their money or time. In fact I have talked about my disastrous experience already a few times.What a shame. No wonder so many restaurants shut down permanently. Coz most of them have no clue how this industry works.You guys keep trying!

My husband and I walked in 2 weeks ago for a quick lunch. It was just before noon on a weekday a few days before Christmas. The place was set up as if for a function. When we walked in, the 4 staff that were standing around not doing anything just glanced up at us and didn't say a word. So we stood there for a good minute before I decided to ask if they were closed for a function and the waitress said no and politely seated us down. Otherwise, the wait staff (as well as the OWNER!!! which is unbelievable!) doesn't make any eye contact and barely says a thing to you except for taking down orders. The food is just OK, nothing fantastic. The decor is nice but REALLY cramped - an obvious attempt to squeeze in as many diners as humanly possible. Forget about privacy. I feel like the owners are really confused about how they want to brand themselves. At the price points - and don't get me wrong it's not expensive but then again it's also not exactly cheap given the type of food served and portion size - and with the effort put in to the decor of the place, one would expect some kind of service and for the owners to at least be friendly or make eye contact when interacting with patrons. Not recommended. There are plenty of other alternatives for Middle Eastern food in Singapore, where they will a) treat you better or b) charge you less for similar quality (or if you're lucky, both)

My first Lebanese brunch! Started off with some Lebanese sangria, mimosa and jallab (rose water, grape molasses and dates). I loved the Cheese Manoeuvre ($16) which is one of the new items on the menu. Cheese lovers have to give this a try! If you are a newbie like me, go for the Sampler Platter ($28), which comes with hummus (supposedly the best in Singapore), labneh, warak enab, falafel, tabouleh, pumpkin kibbehs, bread and vegetable sticks. Another dish worth giving a shot is the Big Breakfast ($20), comprising of labneh yogurt cheese, fattet hummus, sunny side up with an assortment of vegetables and bread. This is good for two
5
Came on a quiet weekday and this place was an absolute hidden gem! Never tried Lebanese cuisine and I'm glad I did. Besides the great ambience, I tried their Chicken Sharwama and Burghul Salad. Their portions were really huge and their food was really flavorful. Guess this will be my next favorite hangout
5
Went here on a gloomy night. Was having a hard day at work however urban bites team made my day! Amazing food and service! So much warmth and hospitality üíïüíïüíïüíï‚ù§Ô∏è
Kudos Urban Bites, keep the good work going!

Came here on a tuesday night, less than a handful of tables. Food was pretty good. Drinks were a disaster. We had to send back two bottles of wine that were corcked.... quite disappointing. Takes 20 mins for a beer to arrive
5
When ever we visit Singapore we visit this restaurant at least once.
It serves the most delicious Mediterranean cuisine. The lamb kebabs and hummus are a must! The service is warm and good!
4
Excellent experience as always. I like the food and the choice proposed. it is one of my favourite. The taste is consistent. Please keep it this way!
Thanks to the chef and his team.
4
It is a good warm place which serves authentic food at decent pricing. The ambience is also very nice
4
I decided to give Urban Bites a shot again after 3 years on a friend's recommendation. I actually liked the food so much, I went back! They have revamped their interiors and the menu, much better than the previous setup.Across both occasions, I had the Sampler Platter (Hummus, Baba Ghaboush, Muhammara with Pita), Grilled Halloumi (aka Halloumi Bruschetta), Halloumi Sandwich (came with a salad), Spicy Falafel Wrap (came with a salad and the most delectable Sweet Potato Fries), and Muhalabiah (creamy and decadent). The portions were filling and food was great, I will definitely revisit
4
We ordered the mixed grill which is composed of lamb, beef, and chicken skewers, the lamb taco, and Lebanese drinks. The mixed grill tasted good and is able to serve two people. The lamb taco has three servings (although one person can easily eat two) and it tasted nice as well. As for the Lebanese drinks, I had the iced Tamer Hindi which is something different but refreshing and it somewhat resembles the Himalayan tea
1
Food even if great is not worth if you cant serve with smile. The lady handling our group of 12 people was wearing a RED shirt and seemed terribly stressed or angry .Thats not the way if we all can see your reactions loud and clear. Period...I am never coming again.
5
Very cozy, warm and inviting atmosphere in CBD area. We love their Shish taouk & mixed grill platter great portion to share. We can't get over with Muhummara & Baba Ganoush dips, simply the best! Truly an authentic Mediterranean cuisine. Staff were very attentive, friendly and has the initiative especially if you're not too familiar with the dishes, they're very eager to recommend and explain what the food is all about. Definitely one of the best place to unwind after office hours
2
Food overall was poor, some was good, some was ok, and the rest unacceptable to be servedFor the good, the hummus is excellent , and the rice was decentThe chicken kabab was ok and the beef kabab (meat chunks ) was ok For the unacceptable: They advertised fresh Lebanese bread, the bread they gave me was old and staleThey advertised Fattouch, except they served lettuce with tomatoes and cucumber and nothing elsethe minced lamb too salty, dry and burntThe chicken Shish Tawook was dry and STRINGYThis place is not recommended .
4
Always appreciate the food and the atmosphere at URBAN BITES. Authentic and tasty middles eastern food.
Friendly staff
Keep it this way!
4
Nice small casual restaurant in pleasant area.
Great selection of middle eastern food, and good size portions.
5
Food was absolutely delicious and good portion. Staff are very friendly and informative, attentive and accommodating. Great location too.
4
Pleasant place for dining, mid range price. food is good. The staff are friendly and patient to walk us through menu. (First time trying lebanese food~) good experience. The restaurant even.offerred.complimentary dessert. Very kind indeed.
4
Warm friendly hosts, wonderful food and superb ambience. Loved Urban Bites. PS do try the coffee - wonderfully aromatic Turkish coffee!
4
Dropped by for dinner at this place on a weekday. It's a small place with mostly indoor seating. Service is very warm and friendly. The menu is quite elaborate. The kebabs are well prepared and the hummus is nice too! The portions of tea should be larger, we felt. Since, it was a weekday there weren't too many people waiting on us and we could take our time and explored the menu slowly. The food isn't outstanding but definitely delicious and worth a try.
4
Popped by for lunch on Saturday, restaurant was fully seated but service was still good and friendly. The parsley and tomato salad was refreshing and paired well with all the meat dishes, chicken kebab set was my favorite and portions were generous. Sweet yogurt drink and cinnamon tea are also quite good. Grilled beef wrap was a bit dry though fragrant. Would like to visit again for the fresh food and good vibe.
1
My colleague just joined us and I wanted to bring them to somewhere 'special'. Been there a year ago, good food but bad service, so I was prepared. To my disappointment, the service was much better BUT the chicken and beef was dry and tough - so this is then 'expensive' for me. Will not visit again and I felt embarrassed for bringing my team of 6 there

It is hard to find a nice quiet restaurant in Singapore with the whole overwhelming population problem in that one tiny dot on the map. Telok Ayer is one rare gem that houses a number of nice eateries, and Urban Bites is one of the leaders in that list of eateries. Middle Eastern food in Singapore is a-plenty (especially the overrated ones in Arab street) but quality middle eastern food... Not so much. Urban Bites surprised me with its very intimate setting, and great food. The menu reflects a wide variety of food without being too overwhelming. Definitely a go-to if you're looking for a nice quiet romantic dinner. Enjoy!
5
I was walking along telok ayer st. When i saw urban bites. I got curious and saw that they are serving my favorites which are baba ganouj and zaatar.I had grilled halomi and kebbeh as starters and mixed grill and zaatar. And the girl was really good because she warned me that i might over ordered. I should have listened to her. Ended up packing them for home.  The food was simply amazing and the service was excellent especially the girl. She was really kind and suggested really well too. Even the guys friendly too. Overall, food was great but the service was amazing. Loved talking to that girl! I will be back soon
5
I regularly go to this restaurant, and since September 2015 it's actually much better than a few months before. The Lebanese food they serve is just super good!
4
We were the only ones there (as we came just before dinner time). The place is cosy and the service is wonderful.
We had the sampler as well as two other mains.
Overall: Very good
Service: Excellent
Food: Good
4
A nice place for a relatively relaxed business lunch. The food is great nicely prepared and scrumptious.
It's in an interesting part of town as well, so there plenty of options for a coffee afterwards
3
A group of us are her for lunch. We had three mezze and a mixed grill. The food was served quickly. Service and food were pretty average.
3
We had a business dinner and needed a halal restaurant for one of our guests. As it was the first day of Ramadan, most halal restaurants in town were closed. This one was open.Food was ok, however much bread. I had lettuce with meat in all forms. The classic hummus was good. The meat was salty, the service average.One needs to order two or three dishes for each person in order to not go back hungry.Ok lah
3
I used to go for Urban Bites every weeks, the food was very good and the set menu a hit every time. Last week, after a year without going, my friend and I took a set meal which was coming with a Kibbeh. It was tasteless... a real disappointment
4
We were craving for meats and smoked veg Middle East style.We got it fast. Portions were not large so we tried a few things. Flavours were good and when served warm aroma made us go for it. Mezzes, haloumi and smoked aubergine and kebabs kept us satisfied. Baklava ended the evening with coffee to a good experience.  food was tasty and satisfactory (as someone who lived in Istanbul for 2 years). It arrived quick and piping hot. I would say the standards for the mains are a shade or 2 above the average cafe in Turkey. That said, the mezzas, Lebanese turkish coffee was superb, as were the baklava.Service was matching and staff helpful and friendly
2
Had lunch with a friend, and was disappointed. The food was very average, but then completely over-priced for the small portions and quality. Either need to provide better value for money or reduce prices to match what they provide - unlikely to go again unless something changes
4
The food was tasty and satisfactory (as someone who lived in Istanbul for 2 years). It arrived quick and piping hot. I would say the standards for the mains are a shade or 2 above the average cafe in Turkey. That said, the mezzas, Lebanese turkish coffee was superb, as were the baklava.Service was excellent, un-intrusive yet promptly on-hand with timely and well-placed promptings and suggestions.Ambience was rather excellent. I enjoyed the lightness of the place, yet it was elegant and cosy at the same time
3
I visited for lunch with some colleagues. For starters we had some grilled haloumi and humous which was tasty enough for what it is. For main we had lamb chops (S$30) and for that price it was not worth it, minimal amount of food we felt. Also order the lamb kebab which had a good flavour. Staff were helpful and it seems to be a busy place at lunchtimes. Food-wise it s little underwhelming. For the price you pay it's far too commercial, i.e. "let's have a go at Lebanese food in an Asian country".Also later that day the 3 of us had dodgy stomachs
5
We came here for lunch, and it was very busy! Popular place it is! Food is quite good, delicious, and authentic yet inexpensive. So, you get restaurant food for street food price practically. Wait staff was quick and friendly. Highly recommend it!
5
I have been looking for a decent place in Singapore to have Lebanese food, and finally found a place that can serve a delicious shawarma and the simple staple, hummus, of different sorts. Urban Bites is now my go-to restaurant for middle-eastern cuisine cravings.
5
Newly redecorated (it's still not fashion but it's fine), you don't go there for the decoration but to eat one of the best Libanese food in Singapore. They increase their prices recently but it's fine (for Singapore).
2
Used to be one of my favourite lunch places till they recently increased prices and changed a lot. Outdoor seating is much less comfortable now and for some food combinations (like mezze) you pay double. Very disappointing. Will have to find another place.
4
Great lebanese food! Fresh hot za'atar bread, creamy fresh hummus, and terrific chicken shish tawook! Good prices and good service! If they had a full bar, this place would be perfect! Definately on the list of places we will visit often.
5
I went to this place a couple months back and it was so-so, but I've returned 3 times recently and it is excellent Lebanese food, very tasty, and the interior is nice too. The place went via a make-over apparently and it's my favorite Lebanese restaurant in Singapore now
4
Had a quiet dinner after stumbling upon this hideout on a Saturday afternoon. Ordered the lamb shwarma with rice and the portion was great. I just couldn't resist ordering a little sweet treats and of course didn't regret it as the treats matched perfectly with my saffron tea!Would definitely recommend and come back again..!
4
Nestled in Telok Ayer, this eatery serves authentic Lebanese and Mediterranean food. Newly refurbished, it is now more spacious. Staff is helpful. It doesn't come cheap but the portions are reasonable. Go with a few friends and share. I recommend the hummus (probably the best in Singapore!) and the Shish Taouk. Yummy
4
ive been coming here for years.. My favorite place in fact for lunch.Went this week to find refurbishment, new menu AND REMOVAL OF THE SET LUNCH!Why? It was so good, so popular. The new menu has it all but prices have risen...Still love the food and the staff, but I hope they will see sense to reinstate a reasonable set lunch (15 dollars?) .... If not trade may dwindle which would be a real shame
1
I was a fan of Urban Bites once upon a time. I have been a regular visitor at this place. However, with each visit I have experienced a deteriorating quality of food and service. Today I visited this place with my friends. The staff took 20 mins to take our order. Notwithstanding that the food (lunch set) was quite a disappointment and so was the once upon yummy desert. The staff is quite rude and wanted to pick my friend's place while she was still eating her food! Overall a terrible experience and I am not going back again. They have lost a loyal customer
4
Had some pastries and a main course. Nice food. Great to be able to savour Mediterranean food in the city. Very quiet restaurant though. If only some soft music played would enhance the dining experience.
4
We went there for diner with some friends. Food was good and you can find most of the Lebanese traditional dishes.
We'll go back for the food but the service need some improvement..
4
The food is overall pretty good, and some unsual choices particularly the breads which are pretty good. The portions were of good sizes, the prices though slightly on the higher side.
3
I've eaten here numerous times and the food is good and very reasonably priced and authentic.However, they are very inflexible and won't serve me an item off the breakfast menu for lunch. I appreciate that this might be difficult when they are busy but they weren't today. The female owner was rude. I won't be going back
4
I brought my Lebanese friends here and they are all impressed by the authenticity of the food. I don't think the atmosphere is anything to rave about but at least it is better than the old location. I think the food make up for the lack in atmosphere. The service is a bit slow when it is crowded but the staff is still friendly especially when you get the owner/manager recommending you dishes :-)My all time favourites here are their moutabal, grilled haloumi, kebbeh, chicken liver with pomegranate molasses (they are divine!) and of course the meat selections of kebabs and shawarmas. But whatever you do, please save some for the delicious baklava selection
3
Read some good reviews for Urban Bites and decided to give it a shot on a weekday. It's a cosy little restaurant tucked away at the far end of Telok Ayer street, definitely away from the buzz and traffic. The menu's exhaustive and they have some rather unusual choices. For two, we ordered the Grilled Halloumi, Zaatar Labneh Bread, Batata Harara, and Falafel. The Halloumi was incredibly salty - much saltier than your regular Halloumi. The Zaatar Labneh bread was nice - the bread was soft and the topping was just right. The potatoes were too oily and full of spice and nothing else really. The Falafel was crisp and well done. Individually, each of the food items weren't anything to rave about but they went well together. For a one-off visit, Urban Bites is fairly good, but not sure if I'll go out of my way to pay them a visit again
4
Was introduced by a friend who is a native of the UAE. If you are looking for authentic Mediterranean flavours,Urban Bites is the place to go.Headed by a Lebanese head chef (he is the owner), all the food are prepared the traditional way.Because of these authentic flavours,many Middle Eastern expats in Singapore come here to get a taste of home
2
The set meal is $15, for a weekday lunch for that price, I have some expectations. The food arrived fast and rather cold. The Turkish coffee, which I paid for $4 a cup, I can't understand if it's espresso as the cup is very small, however, there's no taste at all ! The coffee at the food court is much better. And I was appaled when the guy next to our table requested for more garlic sauce, and he was told it's additional $2. The place is a total rip-off, won't come here again
3
Ordered lamb shawarma for myself. The meat is nice, but the bread is dry. It came in a sad looking plate without anything else. My friends ordered chicken shawarma, kebabs sets, etc, none of them is particularly great.Service is terrible. Waitress seems overwhelmed by lunch crowd, therefore no smiles nor any normal human interaction. There were 5 of us, they didn't even offer us seat and let us wait by the road side. Until some nice gentlemen who were sitting on the outdoor seats offered us half of their table. When we finally got seated, it was by the road side, and one side of the seating is taller (as the chairs are on the pedestrians) so we have to hunch when we eat.Food was basically thrown in front of us when they arrived. Won't come back here. I'd rather go for briyani, or even McDonald's if I ever want a wrap
2
i called at 11am to arrange for lunch delivery at 5pm. the food never arrived. after several calls they said the driver is in the way. i told them i will not pay for this late delivery, they agreed it is their fault and they will give us free sweets too by 7pm the food did not arrive and we had to call them and cancel. its going to take me several years before i call them again
2
Although we enjoyed the food, it was the service that left a terrible taste in our mouths. They lacked even the basic "thank you" or "you're welcome". We got disrespectful looks, and didn't feel welcome.
Go to another place where they respect the customers.
5
Lebanese food the way it should be! Only "negative" I could find is that they are afraid of using the right amount of lemon in their food, probably to suit the Singaporean taste buds more, since lebanese food can be quite acidic.
2
Shawarma- Very disappointing. They don't have a shawarma machine, so it tasted like boiled chicken meat on packaged bread.
Hummus- acceptably average.
Service- Non existant. They expect customer to fetch their own water from the tap using a disposable plastic cup.
4
This was my 4th time to Urban Bites. The food is good. Nice ambience.
Best of all, it's not so expensive. Value for money. A must try for Mediterranean food.
4
Urban Bites is definitely one of the better restaurants in SG when it comes to mid-eastern cuisine. I've been to quite a few places, including some in the Arab street area, and Urban Bites beats these hands down. Fairly decent value for money, and they have a good weekday set lunch
4
This place serves really good Mediterranean / Lebanese cuisine - and has some brilliant promotions for lunch. We went there with some vegetarians as well so worried about choice, but there were many options.The meals are nicely done, the set meal is very good value and the rice is light and fluffy. The staff are very nice, and I liked their deserts. In the evening it makes for a nice quiet place to enjoy a meal with family / significant other whereas during lunch it can get crowded so best place a reservation.Gets a little hot inside despite aircon - best to sit outside in a crowd, or inside if just 2-3 ppl
5
I love Lebanese food. Despite its multi-ethnic and multi-cultural society, Singapore unfortunately has few Lebanese restaurants (although it has many Turkish/mediterranean and even North African restaurants). Urban Bites, now its new location for a few months, is one of the very few - and clearly the best Lebanese restaurants in town. The food is authentic (they even sell Lebanese groceries), and have great set meals at lunchtime. If you want to brave the huge office crowds at lunch time, that's fine; but, I don't quite like the crowds and the way the indoor tables are squashed together. I prefer going there at dinner time when it is much less packed. (I'd like to go more often but the long lines at lunch time put me off)The food is awesome, with just about every thing on both the hot and cold mezze menus quite good - particularly the kebbes and - for vegetarians - the grilled halloumi. All the mains are also very good, If spicy stuff is your thing, try the Istanbuli kebab! The wraps are very good too, but at S$9, they are not the best value
5
Fantastic Lebanese food. I chance upon this place when I was actually heading for another food joint. Since then, I've been here more than 10x and counting.... every other week without fail. Food quality never change, quantity is the same. Lunch time is a killer if you're late, it's tough to get a seat in or out. Once orders are taken, rest assured your food will come fast in 10mins or sometimes 5; depending on the food you ordered and the crowd. Halloumi, Falafel and mezza platter are my favourites and will never go wrong with them. Reasonably priced. Only the sweets at the counter I find are pricy but that's the premium you pay in this part of the world for such rare delicacies. Definitely recommended for anyone who loves Mediterranean food
5
Outstanding selection of Mediterranean food and a great value for money. Good mix of veg and non-veg dishes and good balance of Flavors. Service is awesome as you are greeted and served with genuine smiles. With their latest move to a new place few shops away ambience has improved too. Visit here often and can't wait to go back
5
Went with a group of friends and sat outside (with a dog). Great place for enjoying the Singapore evening. Servers were all quite good and we got our food in a timely manner. Food was very good. We order Spinach Fatayer - delish. Warak Enab - lovely. Moujadara - tasty. The wraps are very good: Halloumi cheese wrap was good. The Makdous special was awesome. Will make this one of my regular spots when in Songapore. Love it.
5
Meat lovers heaven. The appetizers are nice and have good portion too. Make sure don't let the appetizers fill your stomach or you won't have space to fill the main dishes! The food are tasty and nicely prepared. Service is also very attentive and friendly!
4
Urban bites is always tasty and reasonably priced. Good variety of food on the menu, halloumi is amazing! Also mixed grill, different kebabs, yum! Service is always polite and efficient. Definitely recommend for a midweek meal.
4
The food is awesome despite the modest decor. Prices are reasonable. I feel that the food is so much better than those you can find at Arab street. I will certainly return....
4
Set lunch for $15 each all-in.
Fairly simple offerings: doesn't seem to have varied much in the past year I've been going there.
Starter of soup, main course of kebabs, felafel, hommous and rice, basic dessert.
Popular place in Telok Ayer street.
4
They recently moved about 1 block, but the difference is barely noticeable. I've had the mixed kebabs twice, and have been satisfied both times. Meats are tasty, juicy. My wife had a salad the first time and didn't love it, had chicken kebabs the second time and was very happy. Compared to other restaurants in the area, this one is a little more on the casual side, and isn't frustratingly expensive. Good for a quick dinner on a weeknight, but perhaps not as much for a Friday date night.
1
Having eaten here previously and enjoyed the experience we headed to the new location with optimism and hunger! Our friends were there already and had finished eating by the time we arrived. We got there around 9.25pm and tried to place an order only to be told that the kitchen was closed. We explained that there was no need to cook anything and that we'd be happy with dips and bread or anything that they had at hand. The staff told us that the dips had all finished (this was on a Friday evening) and that there was nothing available. On questioning the opening times we were told that 'last orders' were at 9.30! The fact that we'd arrived before this was greeting with an embarrassed shrug by the waitress. We remained with our friends whilst they finished their drinks and were studiously avoided by the table staff; we were not offered the chance to order drinks and whilst we were there we saw other potential customers being turned away. We understand that the owner, who was extremely pleasant and hospitable, on our previous visit was out of the country. I can only hope that once he returns the service will improve
2
We've been to Urban Bites several times this year and usually recommend it to people.We went for dinner last week and it was so average I don't think I'll go again. Everything we ordered was pre-cooked and re-heated. We order some fresh lebanese bread and it wasn't fresh - it was cold. We ordered hot chips - they were cold and undercooked. We had falafel - again they were cold and not freshly cooked. We had an eggplant sandwich - it was prepared, didn't have all the ingredients in it and was cold. It was altogether average and when I mentioned it to the waitress when we left she basically couldn't care less at all
4
I was introduced to urban bites by a friend when I moved to Singapore... And have been back 5 times since march 2013 as I really enjoy the food! Don't expect a posh restaurant, this is basic. The meze is good as well as the main dishes. I have introduced my friends to it.. And they their friends. The only negative we have found is the baklava... It's tiny and not worth 2$.. But then we moved to Singapore from a place where baklava were served the size of sausage rolls! The service is good, and the coffee strong if you want it strong. Easy to get to from marina bay financial centre... 10 min walk if that.
5
After the first couple of times, it feels like visiting family! The owner,Mr. Ghazi, a lovely unassuming lebanese gentleman makes it a point to get to know his regulars. Even his staff are outstanding & make sure to take care of you even when they are quite full up.Be aware that they are a tiny restaurant & it gets extremely crowded during lunch so go before 12 or after 1.30.We end up going there for dinner very often & just do not tire of the food. Everything we have tried we love though Our favourites are - fatoush saladkibbehfoule medamesKabab teenAnd remember to save space for dessert- out of this world!Probably the best middle eastern restaurant in Singapore & very affordable too. It does not get better than this
5
As a Lebanese living in Singapore,I cannot thank Urban Bites enough for its authentic Lebanese food and comfortable atmosphere. After trying out other "Arab" restaurants, Urban Bites turned out to have the best and most affordable dishes - and they taste just like home. I've only come here for dinner, and I tend to share mezze (appetizer) dishes with friends - I have never been disappointed. Avoid Arab Street and try out Urban Bites if you're looking for authentic Lebanese cuisine (they've even got Lebanese beers to serve!)
