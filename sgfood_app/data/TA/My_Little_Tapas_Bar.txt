Atmosphere was good, and the sangria was excellent! Great place for a hangout or a date. Highly recommended
4
Nice and cozy with friendly stuff. Food was ok for us. We had a ham platter, tapas and desserts. Maybe we could try the mains next time.
3
Went back for short ribs but was told they no longer have this dish. Also wanted octopus tapas but not available. In the end had to settle for set meal which was still a decent meal.
3
Had intended to try a different place on the same Street,but spotted this place and changed our mind. Not the best move. Very nice looking establish ,but food was mediocre. Staff a bit too attentive and White Wine wasn't cold enough. It was all ok
5
I came here with a buddy a few days back, had a pretty chill night with a wine recommended by a friendly waitress. Service was pretty good and the waitress is helpful. food is pretty awesome and recommended wine is perfect for a relaxing evening. Will come here again
5
Went to this restaurant a few days back with a group of friends and had a wonderful time. The service was quick, and the recommendations were great (courtesy of the very friendly and helpful waitress). Will recommend definitely come back in the future to try the other platters
5
I went there for a date recently, the ambiance of the place is perfect! Food here is delicious and worth the money. The service of the staff is commendable, one of the waitress provided exceptional service and had some good recommendations. We followed her recommendation and tried a sparkling wine(i forgot the name of the wine). Overall the experience was excellent and i would definitely return. Kudos to the service of the waitress and the rest of the staff
5
I went there for dinner with my boyfriend a few days back. The service was amazing and the waitress that served us was very attentive and catered to our needs. She was knowledgeable about the menu and the food is delicious. Thumbs up to the service we received and i will definitely come back agai
5
I had dinner today at my little tapas bar. I wanted to try some Spanish wine and one of the waitress gave a very good recommendation with good knowledge about the different wines. Me and my friends took her advice and tried jose pariente verdejo. We enjoyed it and realized there a lot of fancy sparkling wines with different flavors with nice packaging as well for a gift. I will definitely recommend and come back soon

The food was good and if you're lucky you might even get some, but no promises. We were a group of 8 for lunch, the restaurant looked cozy and the menu looked good so we decided to give it a go. The first waiter we encountered was friendly but neglected to tell us that a bottle of still water was $10 so you can imagine our shock when we were charged $20 for two bottles. We were told that they might not have enough set lunches and so we might have to order vegetarian options instead, which was bizarre. The second waiter who came to our table was incomprehensible. When the restaurant ran out of salad she came to our table to inform us and it took about 5 mins for us to understand what she was trying to say. The fact that the restaurant did not have enough food was confusing because it was empty; who ate all their food?! It also took them almost 45 mins to serve us our starters and we waited a further30 mins for our mains. It was a pity because the food was actually pretty good, but the long wait, the flabbergasting service and the insane price of water will keep me and my colleagues from returning
4
We really love the tapas here! We can always rely on good quality food. The male asian waiter is always really good with recommendations and is knowledgeable on all the items on the menu.
3
Food and service were ok but nothing special. The patatas bravas were a stand out...but the lack of atmosphere on the weekend was disappointing. They also didn’t have 2 wines on the list and had no alternatives in place.
4
The ambiance was very nice. Service from the restaurant was good. Price of food was some what reasonable for lunch. Food is good but just not authentic enough. Will visit again for dinner.
2
Went here for business lunch, but my chicken tasted odd, bit burnt, limp salad. Nothing to like. At least the service was friendly.
4
This is such a busy little venue with such great tasty food. Please try. The variety is great although some require notice of hours to ensure the meal will be ready for you.
5
Such delishius, amase, good filled, so want, blinded by nutrient, must sniff first, holy bred, very viteman, such wheat
5
Enjoyed our evening. Each of the tapas was well balanced and delicious, the service was very good and it is in a nice location
5
A little restaurant at Club St that almost goes unnoticed.It's a must try if you"re into tapas.One of the best paellas I've had in some time. Absolutely delicious.Felt like ordering one of each from the menu.Service is legit and pleasant.Not cheap, but worth it
4
We went here for a valentines day dinner. This place, near club street,is quite popular. We did not have a reservations, but got there early. The staff here were kind enough to accommodate our request. But after us, we saw a number of people who wanted to walk in, sent back. So I recommend calling them in advance.We ordered some lovely tapas and the most lovely bottle of spanish roÅ›e! They also do set dinners.This is such a cozy, romantic little place, perfect for a special dinner.
5
Can't rate this restaurant highly enough. Not only was the tapas delicious but the staff go out of their way to provide a great service. I had tripped over a step in the dark and had a bleeding toe on arrival. The staff went above and beyond to get it cleaned up and a plaster put on it before taking our order. Excellent food and excellent first aid!!!
5
Tasty, well cooked and generous portions in a great ambience. Cost reasonable. A remarkable selection of Spanish wines. Can't Wait to return.
4
Had a treat of tapas and a glass of wine each, nice cosy place with the right ambience, suitable for a date. The premium wines are great but avoid the house pours.
4
I have never tried Spanish food before until yesterday. Very good and yummy experience I had with different kinds of tapas like Gambas and Jamone. Service was very attentive and friendly. I will come back definitely for next time.
3
Food was ok. Service is very good. Quieter place with spacious table. It's really good for friends gathering or couple dinner.
5
Authentic Spanish food and wine, lovely staff, nice cosy atmosphere. Food is fantastic and generous in serving.
5
went with a friend for a casual dinner
especially the Lamb Chops were fantastic
will definitely be back
4
Straight forward classic Spanish Tapas, similar to the types we had in Seville, Spain. Not the new age fancy fusion types like Bam, FOC or Esquina (which I like too), but just as satisfying. We had scallops, prawns and paella. The paella is one of the better ones I had in Singapore - fragrant and flavourful with generous seasoning of saffron and a deep rich broth. Service was friendly, but there were only two servers and they were a little overwhelmed. They make up for the slow service with a good attitude and lots of smiles, so overall a positive experience.
5
I don't have a pic of the pork ribs ordered because I inhaled it, immediately after my cautious nibble. Tangy, succulent, melt-in-the-mouth amazing! I leave you with a pic of the "most often ordered" selection of tapas, that doesn't compare to that piggy deliciousness. #iwanttomarrythatporkrib On a more serious note - the staff are friendly, you can use their wifi and the bread is warm and straight from the oven. The wine selection is pretty good and happy hour prices will ensure you leave happy :
5
Expectations were definitely exceeded at this restaurant! The atmosphere presented a very relaxed environment, perfect for having conversations while enjoying some delicious food. One of the most memorable dishes was the Coca de Probadura, which is a must-try if it is one's first time being at this restaurant. As well, there wasn't a single moment when my water glass was empty, which gives one an idea of the excellent service which I've experienced. Overall, the friendly staff and the amazing food (and the happy-hour specials) makes this place a must-go if you are ever in the Chinatown area
4
First time going to this place. Menu items were not as much as I liked it to be. Ordered the following:Pulpo - excellent Stuffed peppers - delicious but I wished it was spicier Iberico Pork - very tender Sous Vide Suckling pig - tender but the fat was too jelly like. Sous Vide method made it "jelak" (overly rich and oily). I couldn't stomach more after eating 1 slice.Happy hours wines were very affordable. Nice atmosphere. However, I will not go back for the food next time
4
Lovely spot to cool off and unwind with a noce meal. Very friendly staff. Good selection of tapas and great wine. Expensive but that's Singapore!
4
Came here for dinner this week and opted for a selection of tapas with a bottle of red wine. Staff were really helpful and friendly and the food arrived fairly quickly. It's my 2nd visit here and I'll be happy to return again.
3
Service was good, but the tapas was just average - signature dish supposedly garlic tiger prawns, but overcooked and small ...
4
this restaurant was a random pick as it is near to ouroffice. located on ann siang, it is a small restaurant. there were only 2 staff at lunch time and about 7 tables full but the service is so efficient. love that the set lunch is only $14 for 3 course - what a great deal. there were 3 of us, so we tried 2 set lunches and 2 tapas and 2 desserts. the tapas we shared were the gambas picantes and the chiroz al vino. fresh and yummy prawns. the main we picked were the lubina al azafrain (sea bass) and estofado de carne (beef stew). the desserts we had were the spanish rice and spanish cake - definitely will return to try more of the items. price is reasonable. kudos to the lovely waitress (didn't get her name). she refilled our glasses of water and was very attentive
5
Tucked away in a side street just before the madness of Club Street you would be forgiven if you thought you were in Spain. Tapas at its best, fantastic service and a great well priced wine list
5
Third time here and the food continues to delight me. Although the tapas can be a bit pricey, but with the entertainer app it's definitely a steal.Even more amazing was the way the ham was sliced in the dining area
5
I was walking past this restaurant on my way to another place and stopped to check out the menu and noticed the $14 SET LUNCH MENU! I had to give it a try and guess what - it was amazing! I had the Berenjena a la Manchego (eggplant toast with cheese), Pollo Relleno (Grilled stuffed chicken) and a side of salad - all for $14!!! The food was excellent but to be honest I did also have the Stuffed Peppers for dessert as i was still a tad hungry - but I also skipped breakfast and didn't eat till 2:00 pm so maybe that was my fault. I will definitely be heading back. This place is a welcome addition to the neighborhood
3
We had 2 for 2 tapas deal with entertainer app so we tried the eggplant with cheese which was great as well as the gambas shrimp dish. The other two that we had were just a tad too salty (calamari and chicken skewers). Tapas are always small dishes but I was really surprised at how each tapas dish was nearly 20 sgd each... even for Singapore that seemed a bit steep. I probably wont be coming back here since half our meal was over salted but happy we technically only paid for the 2 dishes that tasted good hahaha.
4
Haven't had spanish food in a long time and this place really brought back memories of Barcelona where the seafood restaurants by the beach were awesome. Pretty decent food served, enjoyed it very much. Would definitely visit it again, especially with the Entertainer App where I get 2-for-2 tapas. The red and white sangria were nice too
2
End to end poor food, service poor and really small tables, but the restaurant insists on using huge wooden platters hence no room for plates etc
3
It was a good place to enjoy some tapas and to take advantage on what they offer, for TAPAS in Singapore. Good palce!
5
The waiting time was a bit longer than expected. But the food is good at a decent price. Love the place!
4
Reasonably priced menu, smaller portions (as expected with tapas), we found it to be very tasty and enjoyable. Great selection of wines, cocktails and beers.
Great friendly service, we were well looked after for the entirety of our meal.
4
Enjoying a pint here was very good. Appropriately located place. The price was reasonable. Overall it was a very good experience.
5
Just a quick note to pass on our sincere thanks for yesterday. The service and food were excellent, our thanks to the chef. Overall both my friends and I would like to pass on our sincere thanks for an excellent dinner.
5
So good... I had 2 servings. This tells u sthg... Coming from a picky eater... Food isn't cheap for one but generally ok. Though their tapas variety wasn't as wide as I wished for...
3
Went with friends as had heard a lot of the restaurant. The food was average and it was off putting to see the view of the toilet bowl [the only view] from our table. The door to the toilet is never shut and it directly faces the kitchen. YUCK!!
5
Great little Tapas bar with a pretty authentic feel. Their gin menu is hands down one of the best I've experienced with some great preset house combos or the option to mix your own aromatics. The only thing I'd say is go earlier rather than later as the hill quickly begins to fill with overly drunk and rowdy yuppie expats
4
This was the first time I visited MLTB and the food was good. However, it will be better if the staff offers us a seat with bigger table since the place was still pretty vacant at 6pm. Our table was filled with tapas and running out of space
5
I had to catch up with a friend and was looking for a dinner place and I stumbled upon this place. It looked very cozy from outside and the feel was just the same as I entered the restaurant. As it was a Tuesday evening, it was't too crowded and I was amazed at the high level of service and attention paid to us. Yes, it is very rare in Singapore and hence the amazement.We ordered the evergreen Spanish Tortillas, a jug of red Sangria, Gambas Picantes, Lamb cutlets and a pizza like thing I don't remember the name of. Everything was cooked to perfection and served efficiently. We finished our dinner with a chocolate lava cake which was just as good! Overall, it was gastronomically a very satisfying experience and I will definitely go back.This time, I am thinking of going back on a weekend evening just to check if they are as efficient when the place is crowded
3
Menu very small selection and not very interesting. Been there four times before but last visit not up to standard.
4
A wonderful tapas bar at Club Street. Good wines, Jamons and cheeses. The service was excellent. It is recommended to book a table in advance.
4
Cured meat from the cold cuts tasted really good! We also tried all 4 sangria which all tasted fantastic! Overall, we had enjoyed our experience with My Little Tapas Bar.
5
The Red Wine Sangria is as good as the ones you get in Barcelona!! Try the Sampler Tapas consisting of 4 items, love the Octopus! :) Will be back
3
The Jamon platter & Cheese platter was good. The choices of red wine was OK. The services was decent.
4
This cute tapas bar has a sister restaurant "My little tapas place" on boat quay as well this review serves both as menus and quality of food are similar. The menu is extensive with a wide range of traditional tapas and Spanish dishes to share. Def recommend the house paella and smoked pork. Their Jamie's are also have high quality - can't go wrong. Service is attentive and personal. Certain minor errors but forgiveable such as rusty introduction to certain dishes at time. Wine menu is extensive and great recommendation. I'm a frequent regular patron and will keep on coming back for my Spanish food fix
4
had been to this place few times because its always the place to go if you haven't made a reservation. You can always expect to find seating for all kinds! have had different things from their seafoo d platter to patats bravas. Would definitely reccomend their potatos and garlic shrimps. Some of their dishes are not as well refined, but in general a tapas meal is what you get. Expect 2 small tapas per person. Their sangria, was not strong and fruity, but a place to celebrate
5
I like the tapas here and the good selection of wines that seem to complement the dishes well. The tapas, some authentic while some are a little modern, nevertheless they come across as very tasty. I had a Spanish friend with me (he's from Malaga, Spain) and he commented that the gambas here were among the best he has had in Singapore. To quote him: "The food here is as good as I can get back home." I guess this means it's legit.We ordered the gambas picante, which yes is very tasty. This was part of the seafood platter which included the octopus (which were super soft, tasty, and not rubbery), and the black mussels (which the gravy was such a heaven when paired with bread). We also ordered the lamb cutlets, which were very soft and delicious without any gamey taste.We also ordered the croquttes, which bursted of flavour when we sunk our teeth into it. I wasn't a big fan of the artichokes as I have a low tolerance of sour, but my friend loved it. We ended everything off with the mouth-watering flatbread with meat, which resembled some sort of pizza.After speaking to the waitress, she mentioned that this tapas bar is the sister restaurant to "My Little Spanish Place." No wonder the food seems authentic since they are known to have really good Spanish food as well.It's a pity that the overall dining experience was kinda dampened by the rowdy crowd outside where you'll find drunk expatriates looking for cheap drinks from their neighbors. I was told that this only happens on the late weekends, but if I come during dinnertime on the weekends, and also weekdays, it will be fine.One thing I'd love to try next time, will be the jamon. They have four different legs of Spanish ham, but as we were hungry we decided to go for the hot stuff. I hear they (and their sister outlet) are the connoisseurs of jamons in Singapore.Pros:- Very good food. My Spanish friend says it is!- Waitress is very helpful in advising our meal.- Sangria is amazing! Even though it doesn't have as many kind of fruits when compared to other restaurants, at least I can taste the wine in it!- Gin Tonic mixes are fresh and a great novelty.Cons:- Furniture not very comfortable. - Next door noisy neighbors (Drinks&Co) make dining there on a Friday less than classy.- Also thanks to the neighbors, drinks seem overpriced. But I guess when you compare it to other Spanish restaurants, it seems okay
4
Came here for dinner with a friend recently. The menu is decent with a good selection of tapas. We opted for the croquettes, the prawns, the artichokes and the mussels. All of these were really pretty good except the croquettes: I probably wouldn't have those again. There's also a good selection of Iberico ham available, but the prices are insane (working out at about $1000 a kilo, except of course you only get very small servings). Service was friendly and efficient
4
We ordered the set meal which comprises 6 tapas and two Gin. And we also top-up to upgrade our normal Gin to Premium Gin. I strongly recommend their Premium Gin because you can choose among wide range of flavors. There is one duck meat tapas ( maybe chicken but I am not sure) tastes super good
5
We loved My Little Tapas Bar - traditional Spanish tapas selections, nicely sized servings, everything was delicious! The service was great, just attentive and friendly enough without being over the top. Awesome wine list. Great location. Very good value. We are planning our next visit.
5
We were very happy to find this bar while walking around. Sangria is perfect. Authentic Spanish tapas. Cheese, potatos bravos, Jhamon, pulpo are so tasty!!! Strongly recommended.
3
I went there on a Wednesday night, less than half the restaurant was filled and yet the customer service was terrible. There would be 3 or 4 staff members standing around talking to each other and completely ignoring our waiving hands. They did not communicate to us at all, we asked for a bottle of white wine which came over 30 minutes later because they did not tell us they had to chill it! The food was nice but I wouldn't bother again
4
I went there on a Fri night and it was really crowded. Took us about 20mins to get a parking. Thankfully, it was worth it! We like the cosy set up and service was good. We ordered lamb, steak, fried mushrooms and some cold cuts and cheese. All were tasty except that we prefer the lamb to the steak. Will be back again to try other dishes
4
The food was of good quality and some of the dishes had a slight twist on the usual (e.g. a somewhat piquant tortilla). Most things we ordered were enjoyable and overall a lovely evening.The drink prices I thought were a little on the high side. HH beer was okay but a small glass for $12 is a bit much. On a previous occasion they had a choice of wines by the glass but they only had the cheapest wine available at a noticeable mark-up which was a little disappointing.Service was friendly and attentive and the dÃ©cor has a nice Spanish feel.The restaurant was fairly quiet on a Wednesday night whilst others along Club St were a lot busier, so perhaps a reflection on pricing
4
The service staff is knowledgeable and friendly. The environment is suitable for a chillax event. Food wise, the tapas was delicious but there was only 1-2 mains. For people who are looking for a big main to fill the stomach, the suggestion is to order more tapas. :)Communication wise, perhaps either Chope or the restaurant might need to work on it. Comments in the Chope website was limited to 2 lines. Couldn't complete writing my requirements. Restaurant didn't call back and hence, my requirement for 2 pax for dinner, 4 pax for drinks after dinner, was not identified. There was a change in table (which fortunately was available) when this was voiced out. As it was a birthday event, the restaurant offered complementary tart but when the bills came, the tart was chargeable.These sequence of events show that the restaurant could work on improving its communications between the staff attending to the booking and the operations staff. Thankfully, the event went without a hitch even though there were these hiccups. Recommend that people who book this location don't hold important events there in case of embarrassment. If it's a casual gathering, the atmosphere is absolutely delightful.
4
A free night in Singapore before late drinks and I found myself wandering along a busy, thriving and packed Club Street just off Chinatown.Cafes and bars were doing a roaring trade and the streets were full of happy revellers.My eye caught sight of My Little Tapas Bar into which I found a corner table to watch the passing parade of staff and customers.The food was first class - hot, fresh and sizzling when cooked and tasty and delicious when cold.The boquerones were fresh, salty and tangy of the sea.The aged jamon with crusty bread was superbThe tortilla Espanola and the gambas picante were excellent, well cooked and seasoned and both of great flavour.A perfect start to a long night out with friend as we bar-hopped around the city
1
Arrived to have tapas late afternoon to find the manager (?) and 2 kitchen staff sitting outside smoking and on the iPhones, clearly miffed that I had arrived to disturb their idleness. Anyway, sat down and the 2 kitchen staff scurried off while the manager (?) carries on sitting, blowing smoke my way and doing nothing. Eventually I ask him if they're truly open and wanting business or just not wanting to be disturbed and the answer is "of course yes, I will get a menu".Yeah right. By that stage, I'd lost my appetite thanks, too much competition up the road.To the owner of this restaurant: you are bleeding investment! Or maybe you prefer to operate at a loss on days when you could be doing business.... Will never bother with this place again. Too many options on Club street and indeed in Singapore
4
Have been here twice in a month so that says a lot. We had tapas with cider and it was such a great experience. The meats and cheeses are great, not an overwhelming amount of selection but enough not to be boring. The Albondigas' sauce was a bit too commercial but still good. I like the croquettas but the best were the meat and cheeses. Come early as it becomes really loud later at night on the weekends
4
We just recently came back from Spain and were craving for some authentic tapas - this place hits the right spot. We were here for the Restaurant Week, so we were able to get a good sampling of their tapas dishes for a steal. Loved the chorizo and the flatbread (coca)! Service is ok, attentive but non-obtrusive. Will definitely return
