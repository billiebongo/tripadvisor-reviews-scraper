This is my go-to place for quality beef lasagna, salmon lasagna, and roasted potatoes with cream & cheese. Quick and convenient Italian meals that are ready-to-eat for dining in or take out.
3
Glad they opened at 9 or 930am for breakfast. Things are expensive here so brace yourself. My ham and cheese croissant is good, much better than what you'll get in starbucks or other less expensive places
4
I had a good cappuccino and chocolate croissant. Gastronomia never fails to deliver with quality and freshness. While worth the higher price, even in Paragon.
5
Happened upon this place exploring Orchard Road. Great French patisserie. Try the excellent Croissant-Doughnut combo. Delish! And a great espresso too.

We stopped here to have a snack during our shopping day on Orchard Road. Good range of snacks and drinks at reasonable prices

So-so food good for quick bite. Nothing too fantastic about the food. Nor it is too lousy to eat. =)

Always on the hunt for a good coffee, I stumbled across this place in the basement of Paragon and kept going back. As well as fantastic coffee, this cafe has delicious food. We particularly loved the selection of scones (blueberry and white chocolate was the family favourite)

This is a great place to have a decent meal. They serve different types of pasta, sandwiches and pastries. They have salad selctions as well. They have different kinds of pastries available. Cakes and cupcakes are also being served. Coffee here is very good. They have limited seats available so it would ve crowded during peak hours. This is definitely is a must try.

This Italian cafe is located in the basement of the mall and is one of the many you can find there. The kitchen has an open concept but minimal cooking is done as I believe many of the items come already packed from a central kitchen. Should you prefer to dine in, do place your order at the cashier counter, pay for it; and you are handed a table number plastic tent. Your order is then served to your table. It is a brilliant idea given the labour shortage.One can also pick your food from the food display counter, which boasts many enticing Italian-cooked items. However, if your order is from the menu instead, do not get yourself in the same queue as those who are picking their food from the food display counter. Having spent a good time queuing, I was asked by a rather sullen-looking staff member to join the other queue at the cash counter. It got quite messy as the two queues merged into one, right in front of the cash counter. One has no choice but to be gracious, to give in to another who is from the other queue.That being said, the food is pretty good. The risotto al pomodoro was cooked just right, with the rice soft to the bite. The spinach tagliatelle arrabiata was not too spicy and had the right amount of sauce. I would dine there again, making sure though that I am in the right queue

Ordered egg and salmon plus an expresso got given a number no service ask for a glass was rudely told and pointed in the direction of emptied jugs of water.Eggs were ok , salmon very cold with a few leaves of mesclun and a couple very small toasted baguette overall experience not very gastronomic about the place or service is non-existent,would not recommend poor
4
Had a super Tuna Sandwich.Convenient place for a quick bite when shopping or in Paragon on work.Variety of food to suit every taste.
3
No space for kids, no child menu, if you ask whether they can do child portion (half size) they reject. Good food but pretty much run off the mill, don't expect any special service.
5
We arrived late morning needing brunch, the food was fresh delicious simple flavours and quickly delivered we loved it beaut coffee too, so relaxing and worth the money. The Crodo was yummo!
3
We came here for a light snack. Had the vegetable, and mushroom pizzas. We were not impressed, but the service was good and it was a nice place to just chillax.
4
This is really a bakery type place with lots of choices of snack food. Also great for lunch and quote inexpensive.
3
This well located Italian eatery chain in the basement of Paragon, serves decent breakfasts(with Italian sausages), salads, pastries and coffee; at reasonable prices. It has a casual open feel. Service seems a little erratic
3
Located right in the centre of the basement 1 of elegant and busy shopping mall Paragon. They display a large selection of salad options, grilled vegetables, breads and other confections. A fun and good place for breakfast. They serve good sandwiches with Ciabatta, nicely presented, wrapped like a large round sausage in brown paper. Good cappuccino. Almond Croissant was disappointing. Allow a budget of S$20.00 per head for an average hot breakfast.
5
I go here quite regularly as I live nearby. There's a great selection of affordable dishes from salads, sandwiches and pasta and the desserts are fantastic too. While most complain about bad service in most F&B outlets in Singapore, the staff here always have smiles on their faces and are polite and extremely helpful. I'm making this my regular hang out. It's perfect

Gastronomia Da Paolo has undoubtedly the best Italian Food. Made themselves with skill and great ingredients. The process at the cashpoints reminds me of a game of rugby where one team is blind drunk and the other blind folded. It is however worth enduring the scrum and Line Outs at the tills. The food is five star; the coffee great. Clearly a chef inspired establishment because customer flow process is clueless-and costing them a lot of lost revenues.

Still sipping my cafe late and decided to write a quick review! Likes: Delish all day breakfast, eggs cooked very well, caramised onions and sausages always my fav, great portion of fresh salad! Coffee served hot and quick! Table cleared in no time! Dislikes: Not enough to mention , not my fav setting for a gastron BUT perfect if you are looking for a good breakfast while shopping in Paragon! Try other branches also! Fresh food, prepared well, average price for Singers! Must try!

A quick breezy wholesome meal. Great baked goods - I'm a sucker for their cronuts and caramel slice. Good pizza and generally decent coffee. Great place for a quick bite.
3
The food, well, was not as good as before. the sandwich is still pretty good, but others, just OK.
Coffee is good (espresso), but ask for the espresso cup, not the paper cup.
Pizza was OK, the food is also OK.
Carrot cake is good.
4
Pey good fun selections of meals. We love it for breakfast b and lynch and dinner. Lot of Good combinations of salad to make on your own.
3
All dishes looked good and inviting. Tastes were also quite good, but unfortunately it's very pricey considering that it's in basement of a mall, food court location, not really a proper restaurant. Might think several times before returning there again in the future.
5
This place has the best takeaway gluten free cakes and desserts that I've found in Singapore and better than anything I have had in Australia. The Tiger Roll cake, Hazelnut Layer cake, Nutella layer cake and Chocolate layer cake are all worth a separate trip.

Tried this outlet / group for the first time recently and their employee gave me the receipt without reading the fine print. He FORGOT to give the change. Guess he thought customer would just walk off. Had to remind him and he returned the change. DID NOT APOLOGISE FOR HIS LAPSE Brought this up to management and understand he has apparently been a long time staff. Strange, long time staff, yet lacking in basic courtesy. Their reason for the lapse also did not quite make sense.Not looking forward to a re-visit any time soon
4
Efficient, consistent and fresh. Great for a quick meal or a coffee on the go. The food is simple and tasty. The coffee while barista depenedent is decent. The service is generally quick and pleasant. Not a bad way to take a break in the mall
4
They have desserts, soups and other cold dishes.Always will do take-away for desserts. Recently went back to buy dessert for a party. Tiramisu is always my favourite! The price is not cheap but you pay for what you get, it is worth it. Desserts are packed in clear container. Easy for you to carry around if you do take-away

If in the Orchard area in search of something "different", a casual non-Asian fare great for takeout or dine in including healthy options and serving adult beverages, look no further than Gastro @ Paragon. A local "chain", but unlike other chains out there. For my fellow Americans in Singapore missing Whole Foods' prepared counter delights, this just might give you that little slice of home you crave. Highly recommend the spinach frittata, Moroccan chicken, roasted Brussels sprouts, toasted pumpkin, steamed kale, and cauliflower & egg dishes.

Actually we often patronised the Gastronomia nearby Botanic garden, cluny road(?). But we were happy that they opened another one in Paragon. Explanation: stopped going to the cafe at botanic garden for 2 major reasons. One, chairs are full of bird poo. YUCK-YUCK-YIKES! 2nd, when we ask for brewed coffee with milk, they almost always "half" our coffee portion.So now we are sort of regulars at the cafe in Paragon. Service is attentive and good.There can be a comparison between the scrambled egg set you have there versus the one at botanic garden.At the latter cafe, the portion is tat more generous. also nicely prepared. BUT, I prefer the scrambled egg set at the Paragon cafe. It is smaller in portion but much nicely flavoured with butter.Sinful but good.Coffee at Gastronomia is better. Doesn't turn sour quickly. The portion is also reasonable. So it is value for your dinero.We also tried some of the pastries they offered. I think I had the sheppard's pie (which is minced beef covered with mashed potato) at one of the cafe. It probably cost 8sgd? Not sure anymore. Anyway, it was delicious...just small (lah).Caramel crodo was pretty yummy as well

This was a convenient place to have lunch and dinner as it was close to our hotel , the holiday Inn Express. The good was great and the kids enjoyed the pizza and the lovely Italian food.
5
I enjoyed a bowl of the carbonara spaghetti and a cappuccino. Honest, decent italian food in a family-friendly cafe. High chairs for little kids available. A great lunch option.
4
We visited Gastronomia as it looked much fresher than a regular commercial coffee shop such as Starbucks.
Service was quick and there was lots of choice.
Our order was confused but it was quickly rectified.
Definitely worth a visit !

Whenever we come to Singapore, we always try to stop by and grab a few cronuts. They're definitely the best in Singapore!

.Over the last 4 years, I have eaten at this outlet nine times.This outlet has moved from the back corner of Paragon Basement One (where So Pho is now) to the centre back (where Canele used to be).Staff has poor attitude, they can be overheard criticizing management !The outlet has an expanded eat-in menu since it moved.One visit, the pasta with mushroom was done beautifully.The next visit, the pasta is half quantity and the mushroom even less.The spaghetti Bolognese has a sum total of two tablespoon of sauce.How does this staff ever get his job in the kitchen?The smoked salmon is salty enough, yet it is salted over again in the kitchen.There are visible grains of salt on the salmon !!The lasagna can be deliciousyet 30% was burnt by overzealous handlingstaff will not replace (need to account to management)I have given upand I have stopped eating her

1st time here after they started dining service. They used to just have take-away. They should stick to just take-awayHovered at the entrance and got the attention of the waitress. She said "free seating". So we got a table and waited. And waited. Why no service and menu? Went straight to the kitchen and the same waitress again, who was tending to her phone. She said we have to go to the other side and order and oh. Oh eureka, why didn't she say so earlier!My crab pasta was almost $20 and bad. My friend ordered the salmon, quinoa and scotch egg. It was $30 and the egg was overcooked, and the salmon fishy. The salted caramel crono was not too badAverage food, poor service, very high pric

I'd take time to visit Gastronomia every time I'm in town. Usually for post dining dessert. I'd take random stuff from the dessert corner, but most often I'd take the Tiramisu first, and then something else to venture new stuff. The Tiramisu is currently one of a few in my top of the chart list
4
Best tiramisu in town and a good place to have coffee while waiting for the wife to shop at the paragon mall.there was a few place to sit down but a friend recommended me to come, heard the salad was good as well but too full to try
2
I love the Brand so happened to stop by after grocery shopping at Market Place... Had aglio olio and two pizza... Pizza is too dried, pasta is undercooked.i dun expect their restaurant level of service but still a decent quality of dishes. Will I visit here again? Probably not

Went there on a Saturday morning and came across the restaurant. Apparently it was just newly-opened.Had a ristretto and an omelette egg breakfast set with smoked salmon.My partner ordered an Italian chocolate drink with a scrambled egg breakfast set with mushrooms and onions.The drinks came first while the food took some time to arrive (presumably because it was cooked from scratched and not pre-prepared).The ristretto was robust and aromatic - the chocolate drink was great and just the right amount of sweetness. The eggs had a hint of milk in it, while the salmon tasted excellent (though perhaps a tad too thin for my liking). The mushroom was not the cheap kind, but was still great (though I admit to not being a mushroom person).The servers were responsive and quick to respond to requests for water and serviettes.Overall, this place is still pretty much a quiet spot for breakfast at Paragon (possibly due to the higher prices compared to the other food outlets available at the basement level), but it was pretty much worth the money if you want to find a place to sit down with short waiting time (the breakfast crowds start coming in after 10.30am so just take note).I will return to this place for breakfast the next time I am in the vicinity
