The food is very nice and fresh. Despite the noise, my friends and me enjoyed the lunch tremendously. The salmon sashimi is a huge portion.

Generous sashimi bento set at an affordable price! Great value and quality, would definitely visit again!

Worth every penny for the food quality and good service. Quality of the sashimi cuts are better than some of the Japanese restaurants in Singapore. Service staff were friendly and always there to assist you even during busy hours. Will surely come again for special occasions for their great Japanese buffet.. :

For an ala carte buffet, it is abit pricey but the quality of the food is really good. The sashimi slices we order was fresh and tasted sweet. So were the grilles dishes often ignored by other similar restaurants. The only negative thing was the service. It was slow but I guess that's to be expected.

In this day and age, wherever, whenever I can get great value, top service from an eating establishment deserves to be given a shout out.Went to Himawari for dinner without a reservation. Popped in at 1900 hrs for 2. We were seated from a smiling waitress in a jiffy. Seats were cramped, and I could listen what my fellow diners were saying the whole night. Not that I am a serial eavesdropper, but we were seated so closely, elbow room was certainly at a premium. If anyone wanted a cosy dining place, this is not it!However, if you were there for great food at a great price, you could not find a better place. We had a shabu shabu for 2 having veggies, beef and pork. The broth looked deceptively clear, weak almost watery but to my surprise, packed a wallop of taste, very flavourful without effort (?)The usual sashimi surprised me again as they were in BIG pieces not usually associated with sashimi in Singapore, easily 2x the usual size which pleasantly surprised me. The slices were super fresh and went down well.The fried chicken wings were tops; crispy and succulent, the yakitori melts in your mouth and tempura cooked to perfection.It is irresponsible of me not to have at least tried a ramen to complete what would have been a complete Japanese meal all within a restaurant, but seriously for the all in one price for this buffet, I could not put another morsel in. Ohh, the service is excellent, the waiter and waitresses were attentive and remembers your orders.Tea was constantly topped up without asking, and plates cleared with little nudging.Left the place super satisfied, tongue satiated with enough Japanese food to last me for a while. Ohhhhh, did I mention I ta powed my dessert, ice cream in mini tubs which came with the buffet, that's how full I was!!!!I will be back again, Himawari will be my go-to place for a 1 stop place for Japanese food. Everyone Should

It's a convenient place for lunch meetings when visiting companies in the compound. Just park at the area before the no entry section and walk over to this ground floor premise. A bit crowded but tables are available on this Monday trip. Ordering is fuss free from the daily set and price is a bit expensive for daily affairs but reasonable as business expense goes. We ordered Anago sets which is for Monday. The portion is not big but tasty and with all the sides made for a full meal. Discussion can be difficult at times with all the loud conversations going on and a table of toddlers nearby. There's a separate room that would need a $100 order to use. Overall a productive place to meet and lunch.

This restaurant is located in an out-of-the-way location and you cannot see the shopfront from the main road - I only found out about it after doing a google search for restaurants in the vicinity of my office. Reviews were generally favourable so my friend and I arranged to have lunch here. There are set menus as well as the lunch sets, of which there are 3 to choose from for each of the weekdays. I had the pork yakiniku, which came with rice, pickles, chawanmushi and 2 slices of water melon. The service was brisk and efficient and the food came quite quickly. It tasted good and at around $20 for the set, the price was reasonable. The restaurant is not a conducive place for a chit chat because it was quite noisy but for a quick workday lunch, it is quite good. Labrador MRT station is just a 5 minute walk away

Been here a few times over past year with friends. It's been very consistent with fresh produce. The owner is a delight to talk to, always very approachable presenting us what's the best for today.Had their sashimi, awesome. The toro was beautiful & melts in the mouth. Today, they had sea urchin which is my favourite. Ordered it, very pleased with the freshness.We ended the beautiful meal with a beautiful piece of Japanese rock melon. So sweet that it's just so yummy. We will be back in no time. This place also offers ala carte buffet. Definitely, good value for money as their sashimi is one of the best in town.

Freshly prepared good quality food at good value price. Ambience in main restaurant a little sterile, but sushi bar more fun, where the Japanese patron will be. A la carte buffet is OK if you want/need to overeat, but we prefer to order specific dishes to enjo

I did not get to dine here but would like to share this experience. I was recommended to this restaurant for the sashimi, and there were also good reviews online on its ala carte buffet. Made a reservation for 1 person using Chope app and my reservation was confirmed. Not long after, I received an email from the restaurant saying they will cancel my reservation because they don't take reservations for 1 person.Then I emailed to ask if walk in is acceptable for 1 person. They then responded yes if they have space, however buffet is only available for min 2 persons. This condition was not stated in their website nor on the Chope app. It seems they are not interested in solo customers at all. The response was very off putting and needless to say, I won't be dining here, since it doesn't seem possible being a solo customer.

Share the beef shabu shabu for 2. Good portion of serving with lots of vegie and beef. Price is reasonable, abt 56 dollars for the dinner

Ordered my set lunch on Friday. It was ebi tempura don with egg,onion n mushroom. Ebi was fresh and portion is huge.
It is good hearty lunch for me. Service staff are awesome!

Please book in advance, must try the chicken wings, garlic rice, bbq beef, a wide selection. Price is decent. Friendly staff.

Buffet Jap food in this restaurant is good value. More for dinner than lunch, and you can also get Shabu Shabu with it. Their sashimi is fresh, soba and grilled fish including salmon head. Tempura so so.

The sushi is fresh, portions are generous for ala carte. Staff is attentive and polite. It's a bit expensive, but overall a good experience.

Very nice Japanese restaurant opposite PSA building. Staff is friendly. Food is reasonably priced, generous portion and yummy! You may go for either buffet or a la carte - equally good. They also have set lunch menu and they are different for each day. As it can get very crowded during lunch on weekdays, it is better to make table reservations. Definitely will go back and eat again. Been there thrice

Was looking for a Japanese restaurant close to my hotel. Business trip. Saw the reviews and thought it would be nice. It's kinda expensive for the quality of food. The fish didn't seem very fresh and the service was ok. Sat at the bar iPad the entrance. Not great service. And they didn't warn me the time of last order. I was famished...and had to request for some more food. :( but any how...I wouldn't recommend it

My friend and I had a unexpectedly nice and reasonable dinner experience here. Food was fresh and good. Sashimi slices were firm fresh and the maki rolls were very crunchy and well made - with a generous splash of fish egg roe around. It really was a tasty escape from the mass produced chain-supplied sushi types.It's tucked away in an low-rise office complex and therefore you're not jostling with the masses. Was pretty full at 8pm, so you're better of making a reservation. You also have real Japanese chefs serving you off the sushi bar with a large choice of Sake and Souchu and gladly no loud Muzak blaring out over a PA system :) Was pleasantly surprised and happy to have dined there.

The restaurant is hidden in an office area but the food was great! The adults shared sashimi (very fresh), grilled wagyu beef, tonkatsu, tempura, grilled salmon collar. We ordered salmon teriyaki and prawn tempura for the 2 boys. Everything was so good and we were stuffed. I consider the prices to be reasonable, especially for the quality of food that we were getting

Variety of selection for ala carte buffet was rather extensive, but food quality was poor for some. Some slices of sashimi was not fresh. Other dishes was too salty.Service average depends on the server who attend to u. Only good part about it is the tempura which was not too bad just a tad too oil

Excellent place, very fine japanese food a lot of choice and friendly service . The place is hard to find, but easy to find parking space. An unexpected jewel in Singapore

I was in the area and decided to go for a quick dinner on a Monday night. Sat at the chef's counter and ordered the sushi/tempura/zarusoba set which cost a very reasonable $32, portions are big. However, the sushi was horrible, while the tempura and soba were alright. I figured it must be due to the fish not bring fresh (most Japanese restaurants get their deliveries on Tue and Fridays from Japan). I've never tried the ala carte buffet which apparently costs just $50 with seating at a separate section of the restaurant. This is my third time at the restaurant, the first two were with friends on a Friday and Saturday and we ordered many items and they were all pretty good. So my rating reflects all my experiences. Forget the set menus especially on a Monday. The food in the attached pictures looked better than they tasted.

Great atmosphere, hearty food selection. The sashimi thick slices was off pertinent mention. The generosity of portion given its an ala carte buffet was very well balanced with taste. And they do carry a good selection of sake too. My first try at a sparkling sake... AwesomeI'd recommend this place to anyone .

I have a wonderful buffet experience at this restaurant. The spread of Japanese dishes is simply wide n it classifies the dishes neatly under different categories. The menu decorated with clear photographs of the food. This helps me to make decision in my selection of the food spread. As a sashimi lover, I find the the salmon, sweet prawn n cuttle fish sashimi very fresh The cost per person is $50 and I thought it is very reasonable for the ambience and food.Parking is not an issue as there are ample parking just outside the restaurant.

At S$48.80, this was a great ala carte buffet offer to eat at leisure. They have a wide variety of dishes and there was not one we didn't enjoy. The grilled beef, chicken yakitori and the tempura veg and ebi were delicious. For that price, we had a good sashimi too! We were there to celebrate my son's birthday and had asked them to keep the cake in the fridge till after dinner. When I asked for the cake later, they staff took the trouble to have it nicely presented on a tray and got all the necessary cake plates and cutlery ready without asking. The service was great! We will definitely be back

Lunchtime Japanese buffet. 11:30 opening. Al a carte buffet that meant you just ordered at the table and it was served to you. This is much better than a 'serve yourself'Food was enjoyable and the place was not crowded for a lunchtime. All the dishes were well presented and delicious. We would go again.If you find the photos useful, please acknowledge review as 'helpful'. Thank

This place is located in an office park off Alexandra road. The concept is good - simple Fixed Price Japanese menu - means you get pretty good value for money but it's cooked to order so fresher than a buffet. I think the cook knows what he is doing - the cooked dishes were very tasty and the sashimi was great. The waiters however seem to be lazy and expert at avoiding your attempts to catch their eye. There was one exception - a woman who seemed to do 10 times the work of the others. The place is a little noisy and has a family restaurant atmosphere which is a pity. You could do a lot worse though in terms of value for money. Food quality is good

We ate here with a couple of friends. The Restaurant is located in a Business Park at the bottom of Alexander Road very close to Labrador Park MTR station. The basically do an all you can eat a la carte buffet menu. Wide choice of typical Japanese dishes from shabu shabby, sushi and sashimi, udon to various fried dishes like tempura and katsu. I also think it is reasonably priced at $48 per person for dinner on a Saturday nightThe food is OK, not the best Japanese we have had in Singapore but not the worst either. Service was poor though sometimes taking nearly 30 minutes to deliver dishes we ordered. Several times we needed to remind them that they had not brought our food yet. Also last orders they start taking at around 9.15pm and 10.00pm we were basically forced to leave

This restaurant is not located somewhere it is noticeable but it is easily accessible. You just have to take the circle line to labrador park and walk for a few minutes. We had the ala carte lunch buffet and it was really good. Though it is a bit pricey (about $40+/person), it is worth it. It is made to order so the sashimi is fresh, the food is hot and crisp fried. We went during lunch time on weekday which was pretty packed until around 130pm. If you are going for the buffet, I suggest going earlier because there is time limit for the buffet from around 12/1230pm to 130/2pm

Robatayaki is like a Japanese barbecue, in which items of food are slow-grilled over hot charcoal.The chef here is great. Go when he's there (ask if Chef Himawari is going to be there when making a reservation). He'll tell you what's fresh, gives you the history of the food you're eating, make suggestions, etc. He also has good beside manners so he knows when you want to be left alone. Book a table at the counter - not the main dining hall which is usually full and crowded with people who have ordered the ala carte buffet. Go straight to the Robatayaki counter. My faves are grilled Hamachi (Yellowtail) head, the wagyu beef, dashimaki (egg roll simmered in dashi) and whatever is seasonal.
