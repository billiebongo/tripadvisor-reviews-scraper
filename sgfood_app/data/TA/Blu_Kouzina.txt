Very nice atmosphere amazing taste. Is not cheap but the food is so good that is valued the money. The decoration makes you feel like real in the mediterranean and the service was also good.
5
Special date night made extra special by the amazing ambiance and food. I would love to go back. Not many options for kids though.
5
We loved the food - we ordered just the right amount. They also offer Greek wine and beer at reasonable prices. We will be back for sure.
5
Its not surprising these guys are expanding to the restaurant next door. The food is superb as is the service. Do try the baked eggplant and the lamb on the meat platter is wonderful. Without doubt the best Greek in Singapore.

Good ambiance , good food, value for money . Service was rapid and products as by expectation . Friendly for kids.

This restaurant offers a fine dining experience. I was referred to this restaurant by the Greek Ambassador to Vietnam. His advice was splendid.Had the melted cheese with dates for starters and octopus for mains. At fist sight I thought that just one leg of octopus was very little, but with hindsight I was quite full after eating it with no room for dessert. The octopus was tender and delicious. Superb black larger from Santorini - Volcan. Good selection of Greek beers and wines.Outdoor and indoor seating and judging by how busy it was, best to make a reservation. Very comfortable seating and good working wifi.Excellent choice for dining.

I had a nice dinner at this Greek restaurant in the Dempsey area on a weekday. Even though it was a tuesday night, the place was packed!( (Fortunately i booked and i do recommend booking). There are 2 areas which you can sit at: Indoors and Outdoors. Indoors has much more seats, but on a crowded evening, it can be quite noisy. Outdoors is much quieter but without the aircon. I sat inside and certainly had to talk above the noise and the medium to loud music. The food was good with a range of dips costing $15 - $20. The pita bread is a must have and tastes really good. It was freshly baked. For main courses, they have a range of red meat and served in fairly large portions to ensure that you are very full. Service was excellent and tap water was provided(But you have to specify tap water, if not you get the pricey still water). Overall i would recommend this place but to book in advance and maybe sit outside if the weather is not too hot and you want a cosy, romantic meal

We visited on a Friday evening and ordered jus 1 starter of hummus and 3 mains to share among the 5 of us. We had a fish, meat platter n the chicken.Everything was freshly prepared upon order and pretty authentic Greek food. Portion size was average and if you are very hungry or has a good appetite then do order more as the food takes time to arrive.Taste wise I felt it wasnt amazing but just simple cooking with alot of spice (not spicy hot). It was average but the fresh ingredients and cooking made up for it.The price was also above average and be prepared to spend about $50 per head without drinks
4
Pleasant location, surroundings and decor plus a vast menu and truly tasty food. Not too pricey. Good selection of beers, Greek and international wines plus spirits and obligatory ouzo. All this would encourage us to return. However...Staff seriously hurried us though. Yes it was busy (Sunday lunchtime) but no need to bluntly hurry us through, requesting an order 8 times in 15 minutes, informing us the kitchen was closing for Mains (2.30pm) and we needed to hurry. This was the repeated for desserts (3pm) and our bill was brought to us when we hadnâ€™t asked for it, before lights were then switched off at 3.30pm. We understand fully that staff need breaks and you have opening hours, but these need to relayed to customers and in a polite, friendly manner.
5
Always a treat to be here. Great food, great service, great ambience. The meats are excellent and the wine selections never fail to please.
5
Scrumptious Greek cuisine. One of the best Greek restaurants in Singapore. Lovely setting in gorgeous tranquil lush green Dempsey. Next to Orchard but away from the hustle and bustle.
5
By far the best Greek food in Singapore, probably some of the best Greek burgers and lamb chops, great Dakos & tzatziki
4
Blu Kouzina is one of the most authentic Greek restaurant in Singapore. The meat platter was not bad and so was the octopus!
5
Regular at Blu Kouzine, fancy three beans salad, feta psiti, grilled octopus, grilled sardines and roasted lemon chicken. Authentic and tasty and reasonably priced. Only make sure you go early or you reserve before you go.
4
Great Greek food in a great ambience. A bit noisy but fun. Good vegetarian choices. Accg to locals it has recently moved to its current location (Dempsey Hill) and prices have gone up.
5
Great service and delicious authentic food. We can’t get enough and dine there as often as we can.
We love it!
4
A good place to chill with friends. Great food, and a very laid back atmosphere in Dempsey Hill. The hummus and tsatziki are good, love the grilled feta with honey, and lamb chops are good.
4
Always great- good fresh food, good service, and excellent ambiance. Really enjoyable and different.
4
Had a nice dinner at Blu Kozina at Dempsey. It was crowded and we had to wait a bit for our food but the wait was worth it. Make a reservation - they were busy. Visited on a Sat and despite having a confirmed reservation we had to wait so if you did not have one then you would be in trouble
5
Our family went there to celebrate our daughter's birthday. The staff Mark was very friendly and helpful in arranging a dessert with a candle for our daughter on the house. The food was delicious and the service was excellent even though they were very busy.
5
The food was great! Their Lamb Chop is a a must try. The staff were very helpful and friendly. Overall great experience
5
enjoy some authentic Greek/Mediterranean cuisine in a relaxing cozy ambience at Dempsey Hill! Great options for vegetarians to choose from.
5
I love this restaurant, the atmosphere is always positve, the staff friendly and the food delicious.They have a lemon chicken dish that is perfect for sharing at lunchtime, after having had a few of the starts of course. Whenever we are thinking of where to meet fo lunch we all say Blu Kouzina

This was our second visit in a few weeks, our fiends invited us on this occasion. The weeks prior on a Sunday early evening we experienced good food, when it arrived, and that was the problem! The first hurdle was getting attention to be served too few staff and many arriving to be seated, then get an order taken, then the arrival of the food, sporadic at best constant asking, two hungry children, no communication beyond “your order went to another table”, to be fair eventually they removed that items cost, but not a quality experience! 2 hours to conclude 6 dishes! The issue continued on the next experience, similar, this time late arrival of the courses to be told at 9:55 the kitchen is closing at 10! Our main courses hadn’t even arrived. Please fix the service, communication and slowness... it’s priced at a very different level: restaurant not Taverna! Maybe some training of the team. Had this not happened twice in two weeks it would have been lost in an apathy of oh well maybe it was a bad day, but sadly it appears not. Lots of other choices in Dempsey
5
This is the second time in a week that We’ve eaten there. The food is great and the staff are friendly. However, on this occasion there was a lot of confusion in the kitchen and we waited 45 min for one of our entree. Maya was diligent in her service when noticing our entrees had still not arrived after an unreasonable amount of time and worked with the kitchen to get it sorted out. She really turned around the experience. We were even offered complementary baklava and fruit as well as an aperitif. Notable dishes are the cold meze, grilled octopus, moussaka and the verity of fish. The staff are very knowledgeable about the food and the portion size and will advise accordingly.
5
This place has that ephemeral freshness - food, service and ambiance. Being a vegetarian I am particular about places I like and the food here is as good as it gets. My meat loving friends also swear by this place so it's a win-win. Order separate platters for veg and meat, pair them with a wine and it turns out to be a perfect place for friends getting together. Have been to this place with friends, with colleagues and with family. Never disappointed!PS: Slightly on the expensive side, but they have gotten their positioning just correct
5
What a surprise on our return visit to Singapore to find this wonderfully authentic Greek Restaurant at Demspey Hill. We knew the restaurant and the cherished owners in its infancy back in 2010.The surroundings are very comfortable and the staff very welcoming. Everything is meticulously thought out and displayed with panache. Now they have added Blu Meze next door.We tried both ...Kouzina for the delicious homemade starters beautifully displayed in separate dishes: hummus/tarama/fava so tasty served with pitta. Then a favourite of mine saganaki and my husband had oktapodiThe choice of Greek wine to go with our meal was exquisite.Afterwards we went to the Blu Meze to have a coffee/ Samos dessert wine (a revelation) with our sweet dessert, our favourite galatobourikoWe left having had the best Greek lunch in a long time. Of course meeting old friends. Happy Happy
5
Decorated simply yet with taste, Blu Kouzina is not only a charming restaurant but the food is absolutely delicious and genuine. Portions are generous, to such an extent we took half of it home! Service is impeccable and staff are friendly. The large indoor dining room with open kitchen can be a little noisy so I prefer the charming veranda with its nice team benches and ceiling fans. I highly recommend, particularly on a hot day as the food is fresh and refreshing.
4
We had the dip platter together with pitta bread. There were 4 of us and we also had the small meat platter, grilled squid and grilled feta cheese. A tad too much meat for lunch, even though the waiter had suggested the larger platter. There was the initial smell of the kitchen wafting in the air but thankfully did not stay on our clothes. I felt that the music was a bit on the loud side but there is always the quieter option in the tables outside.
4
The food & atmosphere were good. The service was Friendly & efficient. However found it rather pricey for Greek food
5
Authentic Greek food in Singapore. Service was great, portions quite generous. I would come again and try more dishes.
5
Thoroughly enjoyed the food. Service was even better. We were given recommendations and the food came very quickly. Kudos to Jagan and team.
5
A piece of Greece, amazing food, amazing staff. I love it! We go there in every occasion when we celebrate. Try the yoghurt with honey!
5
Excellent food, great service and an overall great experience. By far the best greek food in singapore
4
Comfy and great food! A little pricey though. We ordered the moussaka and it was the best! Hummus was very good too!
4
We had some trouble finding the place (but then again the Dempsey Hill area may be a bit difficult to navigate in general). The restaurant was quite packed and it was a bit difficult to get the waiters' attention but the food was good! I thoroughly recommend the hummus
4
Brought my family here after hearing lotsa good reviewsWe ordered- greek salad- both saganikis- lemon chicken- hummus and pita- seabream 600g- eggplantThe saganaki with fig jam was the standout dish and I would return solely for it.The service was a little inconsistent with staff being very attentive right at the beginning of the meal but tapered off after. Very disappointed that our octopus order was missed out on and by the time this mistake was discovered, it was pretty late and we weren't keen on waiting for a new orde
4
Has not tried Greek good for a long time. Ambience is good with excellent selection of seafood. Octopus is a must try. The Salads is refreshing with the various dips. It is a must to try the pitta breads. The fried cheese is good but nothing special. The servings cans too fast and we had all the food within 10mins of order.for 2 persons we ordered too much. Will recommend for an authentic Greek experience with nice environment.
4
I can’t say I’ve ever been a fan of Greek Food but if that’s your thing, Blu Kouzina is the place to go. It certainly seems popular with the Greek community so it must be doing something right.The grilled octopus was nicely charred with big chunky pieces as it is a main meal instead of an appetizer. The highly recommended grilled lamb chops was delicious and not overcooked. The Taramosalata, which is a Greek meze made from cod roe, came highly recommended but I wasn’t that impressed by it as it tasted just like an ordinary cream cheese dip. The pita bread was excellent though, especially with the sea salt sprinkled on top.The sea bream was well grilled and tasted fresh but was slightly challenging to eat with the bones.I’d also recommend the Yellow Donkey Golden Ale, a refreshing drink
4
The service was efficient and friendly. The food was good. However a bit on the pricey side. One of the salads was $30 !!
5
The absolute best lamb chops I’ve ever had! Thick and succulent and cooked very simply. The restaurant’s decor is beautiful and you do feel like you’re in Greece. Maybe a little cramp is my minor complaint. Will definitely go back!
5
Third time consistently great food and service with a happy ambience
Hosts are super attentive and suggest great dishes as per the customers taste
Great variety of vegetarian as well incase some people in the group are vegetarian.
Mousaka, pink lemonade, salads are must try.
4
Great food and ambiance, our colleagues and I enjoyed the overall experience, it is just a bit on the expensive side.
4
Be sure to reserve or arrive at the right time. The cooking takes awhile but the food is delicious. Worth the wait.
5
Great food quality! I am still missing the beef ball, lamb and Greek salad. Service was on point too.
3
We had a business dinner in Blu Kouzina and were served good food in general however compared to Greek restaurants in Europe or Australia the food was not at all extraordinary. Pricing compared to similar restaurants in SG was at the high side and the restaurant itself is not really outstanding ..
4
was a bit dissappointed we came Saturday for dinner , for the Sea bass but they dont have smaller quantity all was 1kg up , its too much for us as a couple ... but the rest were all good , consumptious and very healthy food ! one must try who loves Greek cuisine
3
Food was good but not that great. Don't get why people rave about this place as our experience was not that great. Hummus for $16 is tad steep and it was just okay. It's Hummus! The grilled octopus was slightly burnt and tough, which was so disappointing. Was it probably because we dined late (8:15pm).that all the good quality dishes were already served? Don't think I'll come back anytime soon nor rave about this place. Shame as I used to be a fan back when it was in Bukit Timah.
4
Dinner with friends. Make sure to have a table booking. Rather noisy place, so it difficult to communicate with people on the other side of the table. But overall atmosphere cozy. Food choice good. Portions are rather big and better to be shared. The lamb chops are nice and so is the mixed grill. Small portion definitely enough. Wine and beer choice limited to Greek. Brands. Well, itâ€™s a Greek resto... location at Dempsey good, as plenty of bars and other places in walking distance for after (or before) dinner drinks.
4
Had octopus, cheese, hummus as well as meat platter. All very great. Did not enjoy sardines as much, though.
4
The place was very crowded so it is highly recommended to make a reservation before dining. The food was really good - it was a very satisfying dinner. The service by the staff is well appreciated.
5
One of the best Greek restaurant in Singapore.
Good food choices, friendly staff and quality ingredients.
5
Made reservation, invited friends, had fantastic lunch!!! Keep it up! Coming back hopefully very soon
3
We ate in the back area of the restaurant, which was cooled with fans - it works better than it might sound and the atmosphere was loud and lively. We were seated promtply and met with a surprisingly friendliness by Singapore standards.The food was almost consistently impressive, with the Feta Saganaki notable as well as the Lamb Chops. I had the Yiro and the meat was dry/tough and the price ridiculous for the low quality and 20% food / 80% fries ratio. My fault for ordering a dish that probably shouldn't be on the menu at a good Greek restaurant.l "Best ingredients possible" as they say on the website only goes so far if you over cook them. Service was probably the only major drawback, the staff didn't seem to have clear guidelines on who was serving which table and it took a lot of hand waving and "excuse me" to get drinks ordered and delivered, the food was a little slow but you barely notice in good company. Some of the dishes are spectacular, but I'm still on the hunt for the perfect Greek restaurant, I think this one has the ingredients but the execution was disappointingly flawed and I'm not very tolerant at that price point
5
Our dinner for 7 was so enjoyable. The food is excellent, a great choice, really authentic and so tasty. The service was just brilliant. We really felt a personal touch and that the staff genuinely wanted us to have a great experience. I thought the food was excellent value. I love the design of the restaurant and the relaxed and not too stuffy atmosphere. Top marks to everyone at Blu Kouzina and thank you for a great evening
4
Pretty tasty. Meats cooked to perfection, dips and olives good too but chef seems to be heavy handed with salt application, even on the cucumber.Good to see allergen labelling, although the logos very small and bit too busy to read. Confusion over whether fries were gluten free or not
4
Friendly service, make sure you reserve a table in advance. I was not bowled over by Spanakopita but the freshly delivered Grilled Sardines definitely made up for the Spanakopita.My husband had lamb which I believe was nice too.Will definitely return for the Grilled Sardines.Dessert was ok. Loved the Greek Beer - Mythos 
3
This was my second time there. First time was very good and they were very helpful. Now you order the chicken skewer dinner you get two small small pita and will not give you or sell you as a large pita dinner. Also the sauces now extra and just not the same place. Very typical for Singapore-they get a good thing going and than cut cut to make more money. I will not return not to mention two sewers of chicken and small sauce and two small small pita and red pepper with feta was 75.00 Sings
5
This restaurant was recommended by the concierge at the st Regis hotel and we loved it . The meze consisting of tarama , humous and tzadiki was delicious. I had the sea bass which was cooked to perfection . My husband had beef moussaka which might have been a little too oily and cheesy but still delectable .The baklava was delicious , not too sweet and the Greek yogourt was perfect .Definitely a good Greek restaurant
3
Ordered lamb chop, beef steak wrap and dessert. Taste of main course was not outstanding, and dessert was overly sweet.
5
My wife and I came for dinner and we were expecting good food but we were really surprised with the quality and the help we received from Jegan! The octopus is fantastic and there is an very tasty cheese option with fig!
4
The food is amazing perfect for sharing. The meat balls and the pita bread are really the stand out dishes. The chicken Steelers are great too especially for chicken breast lovers. The moussaka is beautiful too. Overall very good dining experience.
4
A little on the expensive end but its a great place for group dinners! Taramosalata & Saganaki with Fig is a must order.
4
Had an enjoyable lunch. We were seated in the patio which was bright and airy. The food was great. Need more optios for kids.
4
Visited during lunch with several friends. Ordered hummus and pita to start, as well as the Greek salad. Pita arrived fresh steaming hot out of the oven -- always a good sign. We also got the meat platter for two persons which was pretty decent, but the beef kebab was dry and overcooked even though we had requested for the meat to be medium-rare. The grilled octopus was the best part of the meal -- it was drizzled with flavourful olive oil and the texture was perfect. Will visit again
5
Had my christmas dinner at Blu Kouzina. It's my family's first time experiencing greek cuisine and they were blown away. We actually opted to sit outdoors for the meal, but decided last minute to change to indoors, which the restaurant gladly arranged for us.For starters we had the greek salad, pita bread and three dips. The cod roe dip was unique and so tasty. We had the meat platter and the grilled octopus leg. Understand that they do not add any additional salt to flavor the leg, but somehow it was too salty for us. The meat platter was amazing as usual.It was indeed a delightful christmas meal, and the rainy weather did not dampen our spirits
5
I've been here a couple of times and each time loved it. It's rare to find decent Greek food in Singapore but this place has always been reliable. We had the meat platter to share and the $98 version was more than enough for 3 people. The starters were nice but we were too full for dessert. Restaurant itself is nice however it's been pretty packed each time we went so reservation might be good. Service is also good
4
My friend brought me here for dinner and though we didn't have a booking, we were given the option of indoor or outdoor dining and seated very quickly.Our entree of the hommus was promptly served, and it was a nice starter.The grilled octopus was seasoned well and cooked perfectly so it was still tender.For our main we shared a meat platter which was also delicious. Dessert of bougatsa (I think that's also what it was called on their menu) semolina custard in filo was a wonderful way to finish up.My only criticism is that the meals came out a little too quickly for my friend and I between courses but otherwise nothing to fault
5
We ringed in the new year with a family lunch at Blu Kouzina. Truly Mediterranean in style and substance . Service is impeccable and food is truly top notch . Definitely not pocket friendly but that is not expected at a Greek styled restaurant in Dempsey Hill. And that too with a large vegetarian spread which is a rarity . Must visit with friends and relatives .
5
This is probably the best Mediterranean food in Singapore. We are vegetarians and had a lot of choices.
5
Wonderful food - both in selection and the quality.
Probably the best olive oil on town.
Well motivated, engaged team :)
4
Same good spirit, service and good food.
Really traditional Greek. Tasty and delicious.
A little pricey but in general worthy.
Beef souvlaki and pitas are great..
Fully recommended!!
4
It was cozy and friendly restaurant with great and delicious food. Real healthy food which hard to find in Singapore.
4
Blu Kouzina provides solid quality greek food and attentive service as always. Coming here you always know what you get.
2
I have no doubt that Blu Kouzina was once a great restaurant. Sadly,however standards very clearly have been allowed to slip. The food quality was pretty reasonable but certainly not warranting the price tag. But the overarching impression was one of particularly indifferent and inattentive service. So much so that we were left with the feeling that it was more about how quickly the restaurant could clear us away and get another couple sitting down, than about how much we were enjoying the meal. All in all an experience we will not be looking to repeat any time soon.
5
Amazing service from the moment we arrived. Greeted at the door and taken straight to our table. We were in awe as soon as we stepped inside. It bright and fresh, very well done. We ordered the hummus and pita to start, which was lovely and creamy, and then we ordered the meatballs with Tzatziki. The meatballs were delicious, melted in your mouth. We had lovely bottle of white wine with our meal that was recommended by one of the staff. I just told him what I liked. For our main course we had lamb chops (cooked perfectly)with potatoes and vegetables and a chicken pita wrap(didn’t taste, but hubby enjoyed) with fries. Everything was delicious. They do not skimp in there portions. To top off a great meal we got a plate of baklava and fresh apples dusted with cinnamon and honey. There are a lot of places to eat in Singapore but Blu Kouzina has been a highlight since we have lived here. Highly recommend.
5
plates to share and were very impressed by the flavours. Authentic Greek food without any compromises. The house prepared tzatziki was refreshing, perfectly accompanied by crispy pita bread. The calamari was lightly fried and juicy. The fattoush salad and salmon were delicate in taste and of excellent quality. Plenty of beverages on offer too. Apart from ouzo, you will find some of your favourites. I particularly enjoyed the oversized Margarita, given the warmth of the day.Inside, the restaurant is presented like an old taverna with relics from Greece. Welcoming and comforting yet airy, plenty of space to make your party feel at home.The Dempsey Hill area itself is a great place to explore, with various galleries and antique shops. A pleasant way to spend an afternoon in Singapore
3
Notice there were too many waiter/server standing round the restaurant and at the counter not responsive to customer’s request. Ask for a balsamic vinegar for bread dip and say it’s not available as Chef said so. Wave few times to get attention. But before we finish the food keep coming to clear the food plates. Staring at you eating because just too many of waiter and restaurant not busy. Very poor management
3
I first visited Blu Kouzina when it opened at Bukit Timah years ago. The food was amazing, the ambience terrific, the service was fantastic and the prices very reasonable. I can't say the same now unfortunately. Apart from the exceptional drinks waiter (short guy, very knowledgable, great sense of humour), the service was really quite poor. Food was tasty but just not good value for money. The new location lacks ambience. Way too packed and too busy. A very long wait for food. Such a shame
5
The experience and the quality of the food was excellent. The service was very fantastic although it took some time for the food to be served because of the crowded restaurant, but it was worth the wait!
4
Good Greek dishes and drinks in a quiet neighbourhood. Somewhat pricey, but it's Bukit Timah after all. Begin your Mediterranean food adventure here.
4
Overall rating very good - Enjoyed the dinner that night with colleagues with good food, service and environment.
5
Had a superb dining experience. Food was delicious and service was even better. Was here for a business dinner, but will definitely return for pleasure!
5
Great venue! We went to the Blu Mezze, the newly opened part of the restaurant. Great food and great atmosphere.
2
A disappointing meal/experience. We used to love the Bukit Timah location - the service, the food, the ambience. The new space at Dempsey doesn't really speak 'taverna' but it's spacious and nicely decorated. Unfortunately, that was about it for us. The service was patchy at best, despite it not even at full capacity. Two of the servers we spoke with had no idea about the menus (neither food nor drink) and merely gave us a blank look (no apology, no offer to get someone to help) when asked a question. More than one of the wines on the menu was unavailable. For a restaurant with so much space, the tables were close together and with the pass located in the middle of the restaurant (therefore servers milling around), it made it difficult for customers to get through. Wasn't asked whether we wanted to sit indoors or outdoors when we made the reservation and were taken to an outdoor table; no preference asked. The food was very average - the feeling of mass production and lack of love was sorely felt
5
The food on the menu represents all that Greece has to offer in terms of tradition, authenticity and taste. Our waiter was not capable of answering questions on wine selections, but another waitress came quickly to the rescue and recommended wonderful red wines to go with the meal
4
We had a big group so the restaurant moved us into their Blu Meze section; we pretty much had the place to ourselves until we left!The Greek salad and feta cheeses tasted just like when I recently visited Greece.The fish was fresh and not smelly. The lamb was tender and juicy. I could not comment on the calamari and beef as I could not eat them. My friends said they were delicious.The baklava was nice, but tiny morsel!Overall a worthwhile place for Greek food if you are looking for Greek dining
5
The grilled meat platter was amazing! Juicy, tasty meat cooked with the right doneness. The lamb chops tender and beef patty melt in your mouth. Hummous was delicious and paired well with the pita bread which was nicely toasted. Desserts were a nice end to the meal.
4
Very tasty greek food at dempsey hill. Restaurant is well decorated taking you directly to a Mediterranean environment.We ordered Mousaka, sardines, humus, and a meat platter, all delicious.Only disappointment was the dessert: apple with cinnamon 8 SGD, but really it was just that, an apple! I felt this item is not aligned with the rest of the menu quality. Ask to see the dessert first. Staff friendly and quick.
4
Love the salads and starters, the mixed platter is unbeleivably good. Could do with better vine though as greek vine just doesnt cut it.
5
Our first visit was in 2016 and our experience wasn't so great ... but our visit on 2nd of Dec, 2017, was really good. Food was good, wine was great and our service guy was just awesome. Wish I had noted down his name
5
Nice place, first time , singapore for two days and we find this greek restaurant. All remind you greece, delicious food friendly staff
4
Overall good Mediterranean food but limited space. Recommend to make reservation to avoid disappointment.
4
Went there recently for a celebration and the restaurant had a nice touch to give us a complimentary dessert. Do note that it is fairly casual so it’s not required to be too dressed up, so even jeans & polo is fine.
2
The place was busy and we made Reservations for 6:30pm as soon as it opens. If you come later at 8pm, you would have to wait in line. Ordered the hummus,cheese with fig sauce and pita bread to start. It was nothing special. I had the Vegetarian platter. It was so basic that I felt insulted. We ordered Baklavas gor dessert. Again, nothing special. You could get it all at Cold Storage,do it at home and save your money.
4
Food was decently priced and was flavourful.We had their lamb chops and their beef patties with some other entrees and desserts. We are not able to pronounce or spell the items.Its an open kitchen concept, hence be prepared to smell like their food when you step out of the restaurant.Service staff, David, who attended to us is the five star here. Good reccomendations and suggestions.
5
This was our first visit back to Blue Kouzina after they moved to Dempsey. The location is great and they have so many more tables now but still you better make a reservation if you want to eat . This evening again was a delightful culinary journey, they have never disappointed us but this visit the food seemed even better. We ordered Greek salad , pan fried cheese , tarama mouse and grilled octopus as an appetizer. Main course was fresh grilled fish and the meat platter. In true Greek style our neighbour table shared their slow cooke lamb with us which is definitely on our list the next visit. For desert we had galaktoboureko ... we ordered twice and it was too yummy... followed with some nice ouzo. Great restaurant and a big shout out to Imbert who gave us an implacable Service. A must visit for any Greek food lover
3
The pros are the ambience, and the food. The serving is quite reasonable.We booked it for a birthday celebration and when we arrived and gave my name to the staff he looked lost and the directed us to a dark pillar at a no smoking sign.We requested for tables above the stairs where it is well lit but a female waitress said they were reserved for 3-4 people. But there were a couple seated there.The meal was good overall but the meal seems rushed. The staff were rushing to clear our plates and gave us little time to respond. They were asking while taking our plates away.The ambience was great at first untold the crowd came in. It felt like a marketplace as the noise from all that chatting wasn't what I expected. I asked for the bill 2 times. The first time a lady placed dessert plates on our table. And after awhile I asked for the bill again, they took out some fruits and a complementary dessert that saved the whole experience.But overall good food but awkward experience.
5
Escape from the hustle and bustle and enjoy a relaxed lunch at Blu Kourzina. Enjoy the best Greek food in Singapore in the serenity of Dempsey , located next to Orchard Road. The food is amazing, fresh and flavoursome, the waiters friendly, a perfect venue for lunch with a friend
4
the food was very good and atmosphere was also very pleasant. not the most romantic at night but still pleasant
4
The ambience is great, the food is good and the service is with a smile. I like the place and will certainly go back again
5
Restaurant was kinda noisy, but is very easy and comfortable. Friendly staffs and Food are delicious. Will definitely go back again.
5
Loved the dip platter with pita bread, grilled octopus, Cheese on hot plate with fig compote and complimentary baklava
5
We had a terrific night at Blu Kouzina trying many of the atarters and some of the mains. All had a typical Greek indluence
5
It’s an expensive dinner but the food is so good. The service is great too, so I guess you pay for what you get

We went in hard with lots of dips and pitta. All very tasty especially the tarama. We had keftedes, souvlaki, octopus and mousaka. Was all really delicious. Service was very good and friendly. The place is very nice with a good bit of cheesy Greek bazouki music. Weird thing is there wasnâ€™t a Greek in site. Very nice evening
2
Specially going for the sardines, but when arrived had to wait for ages before waiter came. Then there were no sardines (this of course can happen). Ordered a bottle of wine, which they forgot that we ordered it. Service was pretty clumsy. Wanted to pay with AE credit which they don' accept. All in all a pretty disappointing dinner (been there before when it was great)
4
The food is excellent! Ordered the grilled squid, humus, pita bread, lamb and a few beers. All amazing, though the lamb was just a touch under seasoned for me. Taking a star off for the ambience. It's a beautiful restaurant, but the seating arrangements lack intimacy and coziness: the tables are packed very closely together, to the point that you can hear exactly what is going on at the table next to you, and it's one of those restaurants that you'll get very distracted by a bunch of people knocking into you, trying to get to the bathroom, etc. because the seas are so closely arranged together. Not a restaurant for a romantic dinner, but great for family and friends! A bit on the pricey side, but that's typical for a Demsey restaurant. Large portions, so good value. Would definitely visit again with friends, family or for a casual date

We'd heard great things about this restaurant so were keen to try it out; our experience overall was average. It's in a great location (Dempsey Hill) which you can't go too far wrong with for ambiance, especially in the evening as the whole place gets lit up. The food was good (we had meat skewers and half salad) - would be great to also include halloumi on the menu perhaps in future. While the food was good, the service could be improved - more than once the wrong dish was brought to our table, when we explained it wasn't ours the server simply said 'oh', picked it up and walked off again. We were sitting outside but another server set up an iPad directly behind my husband (not sure if it was for music or orders), but meant he came back to check it every 5 minutes, and my husband constantly was banging into him with his elbow as he was right behind him. It would have been more comfortable if that had been put out of the way of diners, particularly when trying to eat. Servers weren't rude per se but there was little communication or consideration from a diner point of view with these things. Overall it was an average, expensive experience
4
I must be going through my Greek phase, this was my second Greek restaurant in a week!
It's a lovely light and airy restaurant great service and very decent food. Really worth a visit.
3
I wasn't impressed at all with the food
Service was very friendly....I have to admit
But other than that:
Ambience was moderate
Starters were normal/average
Main dish with no talent not cook art behind
Food wasn't bad...but also wasn't wow 😳
5
This is a real Greek restaurant with authentic Greek owners. The meat platter, hummus, Greek salad are berry good.
5
First class. Great food without complications. Amazing ingredients. Also suitable for all groups- families, couples or friends.
4
Food is definitely very good and the produce are fresh. But this is very expensive and the service is really average: they don't let you finish your plate and want to clear the table asap!
Inside the restaurant it is noisy and hot.
4
Food was really good. Mostly hits with a few misses. Staff was sufficiently attentive. Salads are a must as they are so fresh! Beware of the meat platters though, as they can feed more than one would assume. Meatballs were unimpressive though.
5
Great food! Nice ambiance and service. Top choice. Very happy to have found out about this place and will come again both for business and private
4
We ordered Mousaka, Fried Cheese, and Lamb Shank. Our favourite was Mousaka. It is really something that we've never tasted before. Great taste!
Fried cheese was a bit too salty for us. Lamb shank was cooked well. Potatoes tasted awesome in the lamb shank.
3
The food was correct but I was very disappointed to get a Greek yogurt direct from the supermarket as I was expecting a traditional homemade yogurt. I was then rather doubtful about the quality of the food. Too bad...
5
Visited last Friday evening, the restaurant had a great vibe and was packed for both indoors and outdoors seating. The food was awesome - we had pita bread with 3 dips (hummus, feta and eggplant based) and lamb shank. Kudos to Maya who took great care of our table that evening and made everything perfect for us!
5
Dips were delicious, especially the cod roe. Octopus was done perfectly too. Great meal to chase away monday blues.
4
we had a great waiter who recommended the right portions to us and was entertaining throughout our lunch. the food was really good but was a little pricey. Overall a good experience.
4
Food was pretty good and we had a banquet which was plentiful. We even had to reduce our order! Some traditional foods were modified to suit local tastes/customs, like a vegetarian mousaka (but it was very yummy).
4
I just wished the waiter told us that meat platter comes with tzatziki..we would ordered a different dip!!
5
A very nice restaurant, delicious food, we were seated almost immediately despite we didn't have reservations and the restaurant was full
4
Nice food and big portion just the dessert is too sweet. Love the olive oil, aromatic taste.
Staffs were very attentive.
5
The service was amazing, the ambience was spot on and the food was absolutely delicious. I highly recommend the meats platter!
4
Food was spot on. Only thing I didn’t like was being so close to other tables. Could have done with a bit more space.
5
I have no idea why most Greek restaurants in Asia have a blue, Santorini-inspired decor. Getting to be as cliched as an Indian restaurant called Maharaja or Taj. But that wriggle apart, Blu Kouzina was great. Delivered to our cravings for Greek salad and koftas, and how. Service was fantastic too; they were very attentive to us. A bit on the pricier side in general, but not more what you would pay in other establishments in Dempsey
5
All the dishes we tried are done right. Flavorful and well presented. Our favorites were the Mousaka and the grilled octopus. The meatballs were a very pleasant surprise as well. It had a nice crunchy exterior with a moist inside. Together with the tzatziki sauce, the dish was the best appetizer that we had
5
Service and food always superb at Blu Kouzina. If you still have enough room after a delicious meal, try their desserts.
5
Excellent food - the houmous and salads are terrific. The pitas are divine. There is a reason this place is always packed. Loved the skewers, in fact, there was nothing I did not like from this place. Highly recommended.
5
We visited this restaurant with my parents who were visiting from the UK. We took advice from the very knowledgeable waiter and had a wonderful meal. The cold meze were especially superb.
5
Dined here for an evening out with some friends. We thoroughly enjoyed our meal, service is stellar, and the food is probably the best Greek food we have ever tasted!
3
The food was average.
Atmosphere was okay but the whole indoor was stuffy. Seemed like ventilation was poor and the air conditioner wasn't functioning well. It kind of ruined the dinner night.
But their services is something to compliment and worth leaving some tips.
4
We were sith ours children and was really yummy greek food! Our children enjoyed the lamb bbq tender for their mouths.
4
The food taste and quality good, just felt the pricing was very steep. Pricing was definitely a rude shock.
4
Good food & you’re always assured of friendly service. Great that there’s a bigger branch now at Dempsey so you can get a table easier than before. If the management is reading this, Pls ensure you stay on top of your game and don’t let the standards slip as compared to the old Bukit Timah days which was really nice and cozy.
2
Came here on a recommendation and good reviews on here.Waiters were quite rude (not sure if this was because I was a female on my own), ordered the beef souvlaki,meat was cooked nicely but no seasoning and pitta bread was just full of onion (no tomato). They also overcharged me when I asked for the bill,they corrected it but still charged more for the wine than the menu said.Also...the menu on their website is very outdated! Some prices are now double what they are advertised at
5
Visited recently with my wife and we both absolutely loved it. The setting whether indoors our out is lovely, set in the busy Dempsey Hill area. Food was really good - meatballs to start are a must! Also special mention for the staff as the service was excellent from meeting us at the door thorugh to seeing out off at the end - all very knowledgable about the food and menu options, very attentive and nothing too much trouble. We will definitely be back, a new favourite place of ours! Would be a great place to visit with a group and dig in, as there was so much on the menu that we wanted to try
4
This is my first visit and I have enjoyed the dinner in this cozy & well decorated restaurant. The food is great and the service is friendly.
2
Visiting Blu Kuozina after my good memories years ago when they were located at Bukit Timah Road, was a huge disappointment.
The grilled squid was cremated. The tarama salad was bland. The sardines were not good.
I am not coming back.
5
Great food but service needs significant improvement. Servers need to be more respectful of patrons.
4
Nice ambiance outdoor, great service, but mediocre food. Price as expected at dempsey. Won't come back.
5
Food and service was excellent. Portions were big fo lunch. Think about sharing next time. Location great.
5
This is the second time I dined here and I kept asking myself why I didn't come sooner! The food is simply amazing! Amongst my favourite are the hummus and the pita. I never thought I'd like pita, but these are yummy. Strangely enough, they also do a really good burger, with pita in place of your standard burger buns, of course. I don't have much to compare against, but the moussaka is so good, I've almost forgotten I was eating eggplants, which I am not a big fan of. The moussaka was even good the next day (I ordered too much and had to pack 1/3 of the moussaka home). Last but not least, the baklava. No matter how full you are, you still got to try the baklava. I am really picky about desserts, but I'd eat this any day
4
We had a team dinner at Blu, we booked the room at the backside with capacity to host 40-50 pax. The menu comprised of a wide variety including lamb chop, mousaka, and delectable range of humus, and breads. Overall very good quality and value for money.
4
We visited Blu Kouzina with our 2 toddlers for Sunday lunch. It was rather crowded and we were seated in the courtyard. It could have been where we were seated but it was just warm all around, there was a fan with warm air blowing on me that made it very uncomfortable.The food was reasonably portioned but the price was just not justifiable. I had a grilled chicken in pida which was juicy and full of flavour. My husband had the blue cheese burger which was bursting with flavour. The downside - over fried french fries.One thing that should be looked in to would be the hard metal chairs. Both my legs had scratches which were bleeding from scraping against the sharp corners. Otherwise, I would recommend for the food and atmosphere (sit indoors on a hot day!)
5
Went to celebrate grandma's birthday. Choose lunchtime as she was going on holidays. Easy reservation online. Aircon not working but was swiftly given choice to stay inside or outside - thumbs up for the transparency and customer care. Had a baby and six year old in tow. Everything was done to accommodate. Had Dolmades, octopus, moussaka and the stuffed pita. Topped it off with the rose as it was a birthday celebration after all. Octopus was tender and the moussaka was moorish. Will return for dinner to sample more of the menu.
4
A bit pricey. But, Excellent food! We were rather confused with the $10++ price difference between local calamri in the menu and greek calamari that is off the menu. Perhaps if the staff could have explained the expected difference in taste or texture so we could decide if it was worth the try.
5
great food, great service....my new favorite restaurant! the chicken skewers were cooked perfectly, the steak was medium and delicious.
4
Staff was friendly, and their octopus dish is divine! Wish there were more non-beef dishes for people who doesn't eat beef. Overall experience was good.
3
The food was very good but the restaurant looked nothing like the pictures and the environment kind of ruined it
4
Last minute lunch with our Singapore friend, fabulous food, very fresh! Good friendly service. The decor was a bit of a let down compared to the website! Obviously “great pics” but having said that would recommend, good honest food👍
3
Quite a nice place for brunch, especially in the back where the glass conservatory is. Food is all right, but very pricey.
5
We ordered the three bean salalf, the greek salad and one moussaka. The half portion alone were almost enough for me and wife. The food was excellent, staff was fast and efficient, and the environment quiet and enjoyable. Highly recommended.
4
My husband and I shared 3 dishes that were very tasty. It was busy for a Wednesday night and apparently booking a table in weekends is a must.
5
We always love the food, nice atmosphere, feeling like a small holiday, nice lightning and nice people in the service. Go there you will love it.
4
Second time here and always find it enjoyable. Food servings are incredibly huge and the lamb a specialty although the calamari and fish were also excellent. Bookings are essential for larger party numbers and the service is sometimes stretched but overall, the evening was made all the more enjoyable thanks to the good company! Vegetarians beware!
5
With a high turnover of F&B establishments in Singapore, it is nice to have a fabulous restaurant that serves exactly what they promise, remembers you and makes each visit special. Thank you to all the Blu Kouzina team for making my wife's birthday (you are her favourite SG restaurant) so special.
5
This is the best restaurant in Singapore. The Uber driver had difficulty finding it because it's such a tucked away jewel. I came here on a layover.
Excellent lamb chops, greek salad, and baklava! I wish I could return every day!
5
Loved the service, food, drinks, atmosphere. All of it. Original restaurant at Bukit Timah and that's excellent, hence, when this opened at Dempsey, hooray! Go with what is recommended by the service staff, highly knowledgeable.
5
food is exceptionally fresh and tasty. Olive oil is just fantastic. I recommend the yogourt for desert, like at home on the Mediterranean Sea...
5
Really authentic tasty greek food great for family and friends. The range of food was remarkable for a place outside of greece and the atmosphere was genuine.
4
Tasty meats in a rustic setting. Helpful staff with plenty of recommendations. Not a bad dish to be had.
4
Nice ambience with possibility to seat both inside or outside , good service caring and fresh food . Great.
4
Atmosphere was nice. Restaurant was dimly lit - cosy and inviting. But food was lacking and rather underseasoned and lacked the char we were hoping for
5
We've been to Blu Kozina a couple of times. It's always a treat. Their kebabs - especially lamb and beef - are all very delicious. Our recent visit we had the veg musaka and their Greek yogurt dessert which I highly recommend too. The restaurant setting is attractive too (just don't expect quiet dining as they are normally full). Their service is very good too. Ask for recommendations if you can't decide. Not only can they recommend nice dishes to try but makes sure you don't over order and the servings are sufficient for the number dining. They are rather busy, even on week nights. Do make a reservation for weekends at least.
4
The waiter was very friendly and made great recommendations. We had pita bread with 3 dips (eggplant, cucumber yoghurt and caviar), fried cheese with fig sauce and the meat platter. The dips and fried cheese were really delicious. The meats were done just right (we chose medium and they were done pink and juicy). For dessert, we had the baklava which was good but the semolina cream in filo was a little disappointing. Good food but it was pricey.
5
Whilst we have lived in SEA for over 25 years, we have only recently moved to Singapore. Friends brought us here within our first week and we were really impressed with the food, service and ambiance. We had visitors for F1 and took them as we had been so impressed and knew we could rely on a great evening out that they would equally enjoy. They absolutely loved it. Fantastic food, really prompt service and friendly staff. Highly recommend a visit.
4
Excellent Greek Food in Singapore. Blu has been in Singapore very long time, service friendly Staff.
4
Great atmosphere, great food, just a good consistent restaurant which I always enjoy taking friend to.
5
Big fans of Blu Kouzina, love the food here, the atmosphere is very casual and relaxed... the meatballs, chicken skewers, pita with eggplant dip are all-time favorites, taste and quality consistently great!
5
There was attention to detail in service and in recommendation of food choices. Will definitely return to try the other best sellers!
4
Seafood was fresh and cooked perfectly and Meat platter was Amazing, service was good as well :)
just wine is not amazing but still nice !
5
party of five lunch on a weekday. ordered hummus, three bean salad, pan fired cheese, sardines, octopus and skewer. all delicious. service is just right. not expensive. causal but cozy outlet. great place.
5
My family's favorite Greek in Singapore. Being Greeks ourselves, the food is authentic and delicious and the atmosphere is so much fun!
5
Go to this place for sure, can't miss it because they have the BEST greek food in Singapore. fivre stars!
4
great food, but im a bit dissapointed as they give me outdoor seating with only fans no AIRCON where in singapore it can be terribly hot during daytime. im not sure whether chope website did indicate this, but it can be a saviour if i can choose which seating i want.food wise is great, service is great but a bit slow as its hard to capture the service staffs attention
4
Everything about this restaurant is perfect, bar the pricing. The kolokithokeftedhes were superb, the tzatziki excellent, the melitzanosalata perfect, the spanakopita good (though no more than that), the grilled octopus and sardines brilliant, and the free karpouzi at the end was a charming "real Greek" touch. But the bill (the equivalent of 300 euro for four) was, on the other hand, not justified - and I think most of it was for the wine. All they would need is a decent house retsina (say Malamatina, which does come in 2 lt. bottles for export) served by the litre for a reasonable sum of money to bring the bill down to, OK, not Greek Island prices but still, something less demonic. Also, it would undoubtedly taste better than the snooty, upmarket chateau-bottled "lightly resinated" version they serve. If I order retsina, I want it to taste like retsina for heaven's sake! Otherwise I'd order regular white wine
5
Great atmosphere... Very good food... Service was good.. Servers were attentive
Enjoyed it and will go back in the future
4
The food was authentic. The outdoor ambience was fantastic. We were fortunate to have had the outdoor. The indoor can be a bit claustrophobic. The service was very good. Good collection of Greek wines. Overall highly recommended.
5
Traditional and very tasty food. Blu Kouzina has a great selection of dishes that good for sharing and to eat individually alike. The lamb chops are to die for!
5
Nothing helps a catch up more than sharing a plate together. From the pita and dip starter to the great value, tasty meat platter to the excellent blu salad and wine we shared, good food plus company = great night out!
5
We have tried hot entrees, salad and grilled fish. All of them were fresh, delicious and original tastes. I think they are only missing Greek music which makes a restaurant a tavern!
5
I have eaten greek food in a lot of places including Greece! this is some of the best I have had , suggest a table in the courtyard if you can as the main restaurant can be loud.
5
One of the best greek restaurant in town...with loads of veggie options..good ambience and service. Its a place to overeat :-)
4
Great wine - good food - very busy and loud but overall - a good place for a nice Greek meal. The place is large and offers indoor and outdoor seating. The Greek salad and appetizers are wonderful. Wine is good - maybe a little on the pricy side
5
Being a Saturday night the restaurant was full but that didn't deter the staff from providing stellar service. Despite some guests being inpatient and one even rude at the entrance, that didn't deter them from being cool, calm and collected - service with a smile! We ordered the saganaki, sardines, lamb cutlets and the octopus. All came in good time and was cooked to perfection. Unfortunately by the time we ended dinner, the popularity of their desserts meant that the popular ones were sold out - much to my disappointment. But John was quick to suggest we try alternatives, which didn't disappoint.I strongly recommend this place for their food and impeccable service. Would definitely make this a regular dinner spot with family
5
The menu choice was good and food yummy. The decor is beautiful.The seats are a bit cramped but the service makes up for it.We went for my hubby's bday celebration. They got us a surprise, by lighting a candle on the dessert, wishing my husband and didn't charge us for the dessert. Wonderful gesture
5
Excellent service and great food. The grilled octopus was delicious. Lovely place for gatherings with Friends and family.
3
Used to visit the one at Bukit timah, this is my first visit since they moved to Dempsey hills, the atmersphere is excellent but the food, my fav Greek salad totally changed, disappointed and hope can make some change!
4
The food was awesome. We went on a Saturday, perhaps because the restaurant was packed hence it was a little noisy and there were echoes.
5
Food was relatively large portion, good for sharing (except the fried sheep's cheese that was too good to be shared), service was impeccable, wait staff attends to your every need.
3
Average service slow for simple dishes , Air conditioner was not working half the time staff so so .
4
Very happy with the food (esp the bean salad!). Portions are generous, be careful not to over-order. Only house wine is available by the glass and it is meh. The only thing that I would ding Blu Kouzina on is that our reservation was for an inside table, and we arrived to be told that there were no inside tables available. DON'T TAKE A RESERVATION FOR AN INSIDE TABLE IF YOU ARE NOT GOING TO HONOR IT. Say, "we have availability but only outside," or say "we might not have an inside table, would you be OK to sit outside." Fortunately it was a pleasant evening, but the seating could have ruined our experience otherwise
4
We decided to try Blu Kouzina based on it being "family friendly" and good trip advisor ratings. In my opinion, it is a bit upscale for bringing the children along, but they did enjoy it nonetheless. I think the cost is a bit high for the food, but the quality and service was outstanding. We had the meat plate and several other appetizers. The fried cheese was amazing and the humus and other dipping items were delicious with the pita bread. I would eat here again for a special occasion. The atmosphere also is very nice, of course anything at Dempsy is going to be spendy
1
Extremely poor value for money. The dishes are Super expensive. Eg a plate of hummus is 16$ and doesn't come with pita bread, you have to pay for that separately (2$ for 4 little slices). Then, all main dishes arrived at the table except mine. I waited 15 mins for mine to arrive and it didn't. I asked the waiter and he said it is on its way. I asked again 10 minutes later and still not arrived. Seems in fact that the waiter had forgotten to place my order initially, and when placing it the second time he did not prioritise it. My family ended up finishing all their food and mine arrived 30 mins later. To cap it off, the power went out and when restored, the staff didn't turn the air con back on. So the room became unbearably hot and added to ththe frustrating experience. Let's just say I won't be going back
5
Decide to take the journey to Blu Kouzina since we have the sister store in Sarasota, FL. It did not disappoint! Fish was fresh and great flavor. Had a Greek salad to start and he EVOO is awesome when you dip the bread afterwards! Other members of the party had the Lamb. They loved the presentation and flavor. Good food takes time and the wine made he time go by very fast for us, even though I did see some other reviews of slow service. We don't mind it taking a few minutes longer for the best results. If you are close by, this is definitely worth the stop! Sorry pictures turned out to blurry to publish. Erg

We went for my wife's birthday dinner. Reservation was a breeze with Chope on the morning of the same day.We both loved the food - great Mid-Eastern/Greek cuisine! We had ordered:1. Cold Mezze of eggplant (5 out of 5): we haven't tasted anything like it anywhere else; super choice!2. Hot Mezze of spinach and cheese in phylo pastry (4 out of 5): my wife loved it, I found it a bit cheesy. 3. Lamb Chops (10 out of 5!!): the meat was so tender and juicy that it almost melted in the mouth!Atmosphere is nice - it was packed but it wasn't noisy. My wife loved the decor.Must mention the service - we got a special treat at the end of the dinner because I had mentioned in the Chope reservation that it was my wife's birthday. The couple of the staff sang my wife the birthday song!We were both thrilled and will definitely come back again. Highly recommended
5
The food was healthy, sumptuous and tasty! There was a small confusion with our order. The staff handled it very professionally and patiently. Highly recommend the place.
5
The best Greek restaurant in Singapore. Located in uber chic Dempsey. The perfect quiet getaway close to buzzing Orchard Road. Super tasty food. Went with a female friend - just hope the waiters weren't listening in on our conversation sharing how hot my boyfriend...
5
I love it
Staff are great
Food was awesome and area was perfect
Meat were so tender
Chicken was juicy and good
Appetisers are perfect

I have a Greek friend in Melb who prepared and served the best grilled octopus, which has become my yardstick for this traditional Greek cuisine.Blu Kouzina has this dish and I was naturally elated to pitch it against my reference point from Melbourne.Before I venture to disclose my opinion on the grilled octopus, may I take you to the other dishes we had.We started off with the chickpeas hummus with pita bread together with a small skillet of green and kalamata olives, grilled jumbo prawns and of course the grilled octopus.My wife, who is much more of a connersouir then I am but has graciously allowed me to take the reign, reckoned this was perhaps one of the best tasting hummus for a long time! The pita bread was a match made in culinary heaven with the hummus! Why so? It was. explained to us the pita bread were fully imported from Greece which has a nicely soft texture and mild flavour so as not to overwhelm the hummus.The grilled prawns were delicious although I would have preferred a medium sized crustesan as the meat of jumbo prawns tendered to be abit tougher when cooked. Our mains was the grilled lamb cutlets. Beautifully grilled with lingering flavour of charbroiled character and tender and juicy to the bite.As for the grilled octopus, very authentic in its preparation and perfectly grilled. What can say but they had rised to the standard of my Melbourne's grilled octopus! Well-done.Back tracking abit, when we arrived, we were assigned Alex to serve our table. When we asked for his advice for the wines, he was very helpful and told us all their wines are from Greece. I told him on my last visit to Greece, I was not fortunate enough to savour palatable Greek wines. Alex then proceeded to point out 2 Greek red wines for our lunch and that was not all!!!He then offered a tasting sample of both wines in order us to get acquainted with and then perhaps make an educated decision of which of the 2 we would prefer. That was an excellent gesture which all diehard connersouirs would very much appreciate.The red we had chosen, by unanimous decision, was a lighter style red having some character of a pinot noir, with hints of cherries and strawberries. A nice match for our lunch which had both seafood and red meat.When we had finished our mains, Alex came by again to entice us with dessert when we already had so much fabulous food then we should have eaten for lunch, but there was a persistence in Alex's demeanor, which I had translated to mean, "if you don't have dessert, you may live to regret it". What can I say but to submit! Alex was perhaps a very experienced and perceptive waiter despite his youth. Knowing fully well we had enough to eat, the dessert was judiciously proportioned such that the size of the serving was not intimidating at all! We were served a selection of 3 fresh fruits of apples in maple syrup with dusting of cinnamon, honey melon and watermelon together with 3 bite size baklava!The baklava was very well made not too sweet and the filo pastry was not too soggy with sugar syrup. The pistachios in the baklava were fresh and delicious. I was told the baklava were made fresh everyday in-house!All in all a fabulous dinning experience and was made even better by Alex, who was an embodiment of what a dedicated and professional waiter should be.High Recommended in our case for lunch.Food : 5/5Service by Alex : 5/5Price : Reasonabl
5
The standard of food here remains the same over the last few years; it hasn't faltered one bit. Every single bite is a little piece of heaven as a myriad of all the rich flavours tickles your palate, resulting in overwhelming sensations analogous to falling in love! Recommended: Dolmades, Imam Baildi, Spanakopita, Baked Feta Cheese, Pita with Hummus to name a few (these are starters), beef moussaka, even their lamb and seafood platter - almost everything on the menu is simply divine! (Tho the above-mentioned are the best in my opinion). Have a shot of ouzo at the end of the meal to aid on digestion, or you might end up feeling like a beached whale - not that it can be helped; the food is so good you won't be able to stop eating! Highly recommended!
5
Went to celebrate a friend's birthday and the food both non-veg and veg were very good. Missed out on the veg moussaka as it was sold out. Excellent recommendations by the staff who were very friendly and we were pleasantly surprised to get a complimentary dessert which was delicious. Super ambience and it was lovely sitting outside
4
We enjoyed Blu Kuzina enormously. Had never bothered to go there, because Greek food is not high on our wish list, but after so many good reviews and recommendations, we decided to go. And we were not disappointed. No, happily surprised! The food was delicious and the wooden chairs, good light and nice accessories make the whole look and feel of this place a very good experience.
4
Great authentic Greek dishes, at a price, in period British surrounds, in an elite expats district in Singapore (Dempsey Hill).Food was very good and served without delay, though there was no pressure to move on. Service was attentive and informed.The menu was comprehensive, however we did not explore the wines at lunch given Singapore pricing.A very pleasant opportunity for a lazy Sunday lunch in an environment rich in tradition and history
5
This great location in Dempsey, is graced with a delightful menu and excellent service. Today we enjoyed all vegetarian offerings and had our expectations exceeded. From the warm smokey taste in the egg plant dip to the creamy Fetta (best I have ever enjoyed) to the truly exceptional Zucchini fitters.... WOW. We who live in Singapore, enjoy so many good placed to eat, so it is hard to stand out. This deserves to stand out and be enjoyed. It is on my list to return and for a work function.Blu Kouzina is able to satisfy so many tastes so elegantly
4
It was my birthday dinner and after some great reviews we've decided for Greek food. The food was absolutely delicious - we had melitzanosalata (eggplant dip), and saganaki (baked cheese). Together with a small bowl of fresh olives, all was very tasty. I was just surprised that the starters don't come with the pita bread - they are already expensive (16-20 sgd for a starter, 10sgd for olives), so charging 4sgd for four slices of pita is an exaggeration. The mains were very good, we had wraps, one with cheese and veggies in pita bread, the other one with chicken. But you actually make your tummy full with the full bucket of French fries served together with wraps. I also think the service was not very attentive, when they brought the pita, one of the slices slipped down to the table and the waiter has no idea what to do with it, almost grabbing it with his hands and putting back on my plate. Not a very elegant and hygienic way to deal with it. Overall it was a good experience and the food was definitely delicious, but certain things were overpriced
4
Great authentic Greek food for reasonable price in excellent atmosphere! Perfect for a evening with family and friends.
5
We had an awesome time at Blu Kouzina. Food was great and service was amazing. Staff was kind to suggest and came up with recommendations.

Had a great time here! The food was delicious but very pricey. The service crew were fantastic and the place was well designed.
5
The quality of food far exceeded our expectation. It was really delicious and almost all the dishes we ordered hit the right spots! With the exception of the Filet Mignon which was too well done for a Medium (done) piece of steak.
4
It was our first time dining at Blu Kouzina and to celebrate a birthday. The staff were very attentive and professional. They also made the dinner experience special by providing us a complimentary birthday dessert. The food tasted good and were unique and the ambiance was cosy. Enough options for vegetarians. Overall, a very pleasant experience.

I've lived in Greece, the food served here is not bad but a pale copy of greek food. Spanakopitas are usually big pastries full of savour, here little tiny bits. Greek yogurt is made of full cream milk , real fruits are added with honey, here yogurt of poor quality, no fruits but jam(?). Well, disappointed 
3
Overall satisfactory but charges too much. Meatballs are great but expensive. Seafood is fresh but only if you can stomach the bill after which. More than $200 for 3 pax (No alcohol in this bill), it's stee
4
It was an afternoon well spent with good food (especially the starters) and drinks with friends. Nice airy setting with indoor and outdoor seating options. My only grouse was that being a very warm day the aircon didn't seem effective enough and it was rather warm even indoors. But all in all a pleasant experience!
4
Love the decor and ambiance of the place. Service was fantastic - servers were attentive without being too overbearing. The sirloin was cooked to perfection but the side vegetables were a little too salty. The lamb shank was delicious too for those who love very strong flavours. Really good baklavas. Overall, a good restaurant and will visit again
4
It was our first time to Blu at Dempsey - and it's a whole lot bigger than their place in bukit timaOur meal started with a quick drink, but for such a large space, the bar was more like a bench that they store things. You get to look over the room, which was a busy buzzing hive of activityOur table was ready, at the back. It was a little warm and the cooling was definitely not working. Food, pretty darn good rangeDolmades were good, the fava was creamy. The highlights were Lamb chopsMousakaOctopus Overall, lovely night. Service tried hard, food good to greatDefinitely will be bac
3
As usual: very bad servise. The food is good. The atmosphere is nice but could be better, the terrace is terrible.
5
Amazing food. Incredible service. Pricey and a tad noisy so will not being visiting very often. Food is authentic though
5
Lamb chop is very tender and does not smell. Choose outdoor dining for better dining experience! Will definitely come back for the Lamb Chops!
4
One of our favourite dinner places to turn to for winding down the week. Dinner is always enjoyable here; service staff are friendly and helpful too. Life is good, have a treat !
4
Choice of dishes is good and servings are good portions
Good quality is ok to good, nothing exceptional
Overall a good evening and a nice place to catch dinner with friends or for couples
5
Love their fried cheese for starters and oh the lamb chops were out of this world! Would definitely return with the family !
5
Blu Kouzina is always a favorite and the new space is just beautiful. The food never fails to satisfy.
5
For most places in Singapore, paying a premium price for a meal is not always well rewarded. There isn't much difference in the quality of the food between a low and high price option: this one is well worth it. You'll find a menu plenty of options for food and wine and all of them seem delicious. The restaurant is very weel decorated and tables are confortable. Staff is kind and willing to help you choose your best option in well spoken english. You'll certainly not regret your visit

We have been wanting to visit this since a Long time so went there for dinner tonight. We asked for mezze platter vegetarian and were surprised that their tzatziki dip is not vegetarian ! We were supposed to pick 3 out of top 5 options and at first he said it is vegetarian but then came back from kitchen saying they add chicken now! Really strange. The pita bread had already come and were cold. We asked for eggplant hot mezze which was decent. Finally we asked for baklava and were sooo disappointed when we got it cold - they always serve it cold they said - and the fact that it contained walnuts instead of pistachios!! Surely not the traditional way for Greek food! And somehow today was not the day- the music system kept acting up with a screeching sound and the the lights went out for a while ! Just an off day! They waived off the baklava on the final bill without even mentioning it which we do appreciate, and the servers were attentive and prompt. Overall we were not as impressed as the reviews- maybe a great place for meat lovers though

We had been to the old Bukit Timah venue and loved it and had been meaning to go back so I booked a table to celebrate a family member's birthday. Went there with high expectations. The new resturant at Dempsey seemed cheerful and lively and we settled down and quickly decided what we wanted to order. Service seemed friendly although oddly we had 4 - 5 different staff members hovering around the table. Ordered a couple of glasses of wine and were offered their home-made bread which arrived hot and golden brown; the first disappointment was tearing a piece off and finding that the centre was absolutely cold! And then our dishes arrived all together within minutes of our wine so we had no time to sit back and enjoy our meal. Attentive staff is good but over-eager staff who tried to clear our dishes while we were only halfway through the meal really ruined our mood. We got the impression that they were in a hurry to get our table back. Having reached at 8.15, we were waiting for our cab by 9.00 pm! Having gone there in the mood to celebrate with the family, we left there feeling irritated
3
Unlucky to have the meal disrupted by 2 power trips
Good was fantastic still
Lamb chops and Greek salad and also the hummus
5
The dips were so good. Had hummus, tzatziki and taramasalata, lovely with the pita. Moussaka yummy too.
4
Food is great but expensive! Drinks are really expensive. The older venue in Bukit timah was nicer and more personal!
5
Unexpected good quality food and cooking. Lamb chops the best I've tried. Squid was amazing as well. Filo pastry was not great, and the Greek salad portion was too much for two.

Blu Kouzina used to be one of our favourite restaurants, when they were around the corner from us. Now, they've up and moved to Dempsey Hill and we've lost our neighbourhood gem.We've visited the Dempsey Hill location a handful of times and the food quality still remains excellent, plus the new location is stunning and large. Despite the size however, if you don't have a reservation (regardless of day), you will be waiting for a table.The only complaints I have, which is why it 'used' to be a favourite is:- While the quality is still spot on, I feel the portions have gotten smaller and the prices higher (I could be wrong, but I sensed it on our last visit). .- I love wine and always happy to try something new but have yet to find a wine at Blu Kouzina that A) I enjoy and B) doesn't give me a headache the next day. They only have Greek wines so if you're a bit of a wine snob, this could be a let down.You won't be disappointed with Blu Kouzina - the food is delicious and the ambience is great. Just be mindful of the wine choices
4
The welcome we received was excellent, the waiter brought us two glasses of champagne and with a big smile said " Happy Anniversary" this was a great touch. The service was good and the food very good, really thought our waiter was good, but then he moved to another table and the waiter we got was not as good, could not understand English so made the ordering from him more difficult. We ordered dessert and my wife ordered a apple desert, which termed out to be nothing more than a raw apple sliced up and a bit of honey and sugar over it.Although when we did complain, it was taken off the bill.Overall was a good meal and very pleasant experience
4
Have been eat at Blu for years and always enjoyed it. The Greek salad is our perennial favorite. We also love the tzatziti. The beef skewers are simply delicious. The baklava.... so nice we had a second order. There are many other very good dishes in the menu. I really like the red pepper appetiser with feta. A good ambiance and I think a nice place to bring friends or guests for fun meal. The staff serving the tables were sharp and on the ball. The only problem is the wine. I have yet to find a wine on the menu that's worth the price. Bring your own and pay the corkage, honestly. But making matters worse was my mistake of mentioning to the waiter that again the wine was disappointing. Soon after some guy from the bar or management comes charging out, helps himself to our wine, and loudly proclaims how good the wine is. I asked him to take what was left and go away. He did not. He continued to drone on and on about what a good wine it was while the poor waiter stood there helplessly. This guy gave a very unpleasant ending to an otherwise good date night with my Wife. So, go enjoy the great food but bring your own wine. Their wine guru should be avoided at ALL costs.
4
I'm no Greek. Neither have I eaten in Greece. But if is not how the best Melitzanosalata dip tastes like, I truly can't imagine how it could get better. I have been here twice and have the food. I would skip the main courses and desserts and focus on mezes, next time
5
A treat to find delicious Greek food in Singapore. Thanks to our Four Seasons concierge. Charming restaurant ambiance. We ordered a large Greek salad and shared, I ordered eggplant with feta, delicious. The chicken skewer was ordered by my husband and he liked it as well. The menu warns against over ordering and wasting food. Have never seen that on a menu anywhere in the world. Beware not to waste food is a good attempt to heighten awareness it also starts with restaurants portion sizes too. Owner is from South Africa has lived in Singapore for 16 years, nice friendly staff. Enjoy
4
This is some of the nicest food in Singapore, I have been to Singapore many times and this is the first time I have enjoyed Greek food there. The food is simple and authentic and very tasty. We also tried Greek wine with our meal which was lovely.The servers could have poured larger portions but only pour a little at a time so it lasts your whole sitting. After being too full for desert our server placed two small pieces of baklava on our table 'on the house' it was a lovely touch and I will be back on my next trip
2
Meal - says they use good ingredients and healthier oils but perhaps a tad too generous with the oils and didn't really taste the freshness
Atmosphere - tables were too close for even a petite size asian
Service - good
No birthday treat.
4
The food was delicious with good helping size. Enjoyed the meat platter, and the starters were tasty too.
5
The food was really good and the staff were very attentive. Our drunks got mixed up and they promptly changed them. Food arrived quickly and was well made.
5
Nice place and good greek food.
Always crowded so a bit difficult to make a reservation on my time. Haha
5
This is my 3rd time there together with my wife and we simply love it ! This restaurant doesn't disappoint. We keep trying new dishes and keep adding things to our favorite list of things to order.
5
This was a very happening restaurant in a fabulous restaurant precinct that Singapore does so well, respecting their heritage with community use of previous government facilities. The staff were positive, interactive and committed. The food full of flavour reflecting the excellence of Greek cuisine. We ordered and shared a range entrees and mains. It was a great evening. Put this one on your lis
5
Craving for Greek food, we went to Blu and was genuinely pleased with both the food and the service. The Greek salad was fresh and delicious, there grilled calamari was perfectly done. The Kalamaki Souvlaki was amazing - the beef was so tasty ... The Baklava was the perfect finish to a perfect meal. However, I do suggest to sit outside as the inside was quite noisy. All in all, it was a perfect Greek meal fix
5
One of the best Greek restaurants ever. Authentic and reasonably priced. Great wines too. I have come here twice and have had double the fun and triple the delight in the food preparation. The meat platter was amazing and as always the salad and dips never disappoint
5
Went to Blu Kouzin two months back with my friends after hearing very good reviews from other friends... its was indeed an amazing experience.. the service was fast and the servers definitely know the dishes well... we couldn't decide on a few items and decide to heed the recommendation by the server and its was great! the dÃ©cor was warm and it is definitely a great place for friends or even a date. :
5
It was our first time there and we weren't sure of the portion. The server advised us that it was too much for 8 even when we wanted to order more. He could have allowed us to order more to achieve more revenue but did not. For that, i say kudos to the team. Food wise, i am a new fan of Mediterranean foo
5
lamp chops were very well cooked! it's fantastic! Probably the best lamp chops I have ate in Singapore so far!
5
We adore this place like no other. Must make reservations cuz it's always full. The baked cheese with figs is amazing. Smoked Eggplant and hummus grrat for dipping n sharing. We always come back for more!
5
The octopus was a bit salty & pricey. Other than that, the rest of the items we ordered, like Greek salad, meat balls & vegetable moussaka were fantastic! Service was a bit too hasty but overall ok!
5
We were sad when you moved from Bukit Timah, however when you sit outside in the evening it's brilliant! The food is wonderful and to be honest this is our go to restaurant with family and friends.
5
Had a great time at Blu Kouzina. Food was very authentic and the service was good. Went with some friends and two babies and the restaurant couldn't have been more helpful.
5
Dempsey Road for proper good food? In 2017? Not just fancy, overpriced Europeanea... This place serves the best Greek food in Singapore, by far!Cheap? It is not.Many prices are downright cheeky!29 dollars for a greek salad?really!!!However, by far the best Greek/Turkish in town!Authentic food and great service...
3
Even though they have more less the same menu as before something has changed at the level of service and the quality of the food (my kofta order came cold inside...) And no more complimentary bread (need to ask for it) and dessert ;( Hope they will go back to their old days.
4
We were told a lot about this place and wanted to try it. We went there with the family and enjoyed a nice dinner. Good Greek food but do not order too much since the portions are quite big - at least for the mains. We could perfectly have limited our dinner to several starters to share.Service is quite quick and staff welcoming.Music was a bit loud but maybe because of Saturday... Place was packed so reservation is a must.Main room is nicer (our outdoor if you like it).
5
Came to dine here with a party of 4. We started off with an assortment of dips, their saganaki, and got the chance to also get the fish they had just flown in from Greece!! It tasted as if it just came out of the sea. The food was delicious the service amazing and attentive. Overall ambience was breathtaking, and whole experience worth it. Can't wait to come back!
3
Normally I'd give Blu Kouzina five stars, but during my last visit the service was all over the place and there were at least three breakages covering laps in water which was very irritating. Sadly, since Blu Kouzina moved from Dempsey to Bukit Timah it has lost a lot of it's charm - the family run restaurant feel with the personal touch is now huge and you feel like you're on a conveyer belt of fridge cold Greek Salads as they want you to go so the next customer can sit down.
5
It is a business lunch, the service is good and the waitress is able to advise in the portion to order. Worth coming back again
5
Enjoyed the mousaka and chicken wrap. Portions were generous. If I was little pickier, would prefer tzatziki to have abit more flavour. Great service throughout the night too and excellent ambience.
5
Great hospitable place, very interesting cuisine. Only wish it was a tad bit less noisy ..! Loved the overall experience.
4
This is the first time I am eating at their new location. It's much better and more specious than their old place along Bukit Timah. Food was good, salad was extremely fresh, and the fish soup was unusually delicious.
5
Have heard a lot about this restaurant and it definitively lived up to its good reputation. Great food, we could relax and it wasn't too noisy.
5
Excellent service and food! The restaurant manager was kind enough to serve us a special dessert for ramadan and before we left the staff wished us happy ramadan it was a kind gesture, we really felt welcome there!
5
I visited for my dad's birthday. Servers(Ayama and one guy sorry I didn't ask his name) are really fantastic. Foods also tasty and healthy.
2
Came here for a birthday party and overall, the food was decent. The prices however were not. The pricing of the dishes swing between quite worth it ($98 for a meat platter that can easily feed 4) and outright ripoff ($16 for 2 tiny spinach puffs). If you're looking for something true blue authentic Mediterranean cuisine this place is about as good as you will get in Singapore but if youve had a taste of real mediterranean cuisine i would suggest waiting till your next visit to greece. Service was a mix of attentive and rudeness with a waiter attempting to be charming by telling us how to eat pita bread but frankly coming off as rude and pushy. Then after the dinner we were repeatedly asked whether we ordered fries when we ask for the birthday cake to be sent. So overall, unfortunately I would not come bac
4
The food and service were great. Our waiter was attentive and quick. The food was delicious and the portion sizes are outstanding! You can barely finish a main!The hummus and vegetarian moussaka are particularly great! Their home made pita is great too.Their Greek bottles beers are a nice change.Only negative is the price but based on the location, service and quality I can understand why they charge that, it was excellent!Would recommend for a fancy lunch especially
4
It was my mothers birthday and I made a reservation prior. I was already aware that we get a table from 6-8pm only when I gave them a call ( ps. didnt see anything on the website) as they have something on. The service was great and sooo fast that a moment later we realized that they're just trying to get rid of us faster. We have been reminded more than 5 times that our table is until 8pm only. We have arrived late(6:30pm) and we have informed them about it. We were already done by 7-30pm. Yet in this one hour we were told more than 5 timeesss that our time is running out... It kinda spoiled the birthday mood..
4
Ambiance was great, decor and mood was perfect for gatherings.
Food was ok, a little acquired to personal liking but there were great stuff like the chicken skewer and grilled octopus.
Staff at Blu was perfect. Attentive, courteous and really friendly. I love this place.
4
Food was great, the outside seats are calm and peaceful. Inside the decor is great and the ambience bustling.
4
I really love the food at Blu Kouzina - reminds me of the food at my family's house (parents are Greek).
We had a really nice Sunday but obviously it does not come cheap...
4
Book in advance. the restaurant was full on a Wednesday evening. Authentic Greek food. Reminds me of balmy nights in Athens.
5
Food, service, price, location, wine, ambience is amazing. My Favourite restaurant in singapore! High recommend to anyone
4
No question, the food at this restaurant remains among the best Mediterranean food outside Europe. But I'm glad I experienced the place so many times in the past, when it provided an intimate setting in Bukit Timah, a warm welcome from the host, and an atmosphere like a family restaurant. Now it feels more like a food production line - over crowded, noisy, tables jammed tight together, and in all the chaos the quality of some of the food has gone down. One of the dishes we ordered was still exceptional, to be fair, but the other two were not quite as good. Pity, because I loved this place and was a frequent visitor in the past. After the Dempsey move I stopped going as often because I didn't like the noise of the restaurant, but on this most recent visit I felt the food and service were less amazing than they used to be
4
This is my third visit to Blu Kouzina, fresh and tasty food as always. Strict table timing at either 6pm or 8pm when we wanted to dine at 7pm. They have changed their menu without the seafood platter option that is better value. We ordered hummus, pita bread, roasted potatoes, mousaka, grilled squid and sea bass.
4
Even though I am not a vegan / vegetarian, when I went with a couple of friends who were - Blu kouzina happened to be a good choice. We ordered Dolmeh (which were just ok and quite expensive for $20 for 6 - hey it's Dolmeh not oysters) , three dips with pita and red peppers stuffed with cheese (this was great). Main courses like vegetables stuffed with rice and veg moussaka was high on taste too
5
Located at a corner of crowded Dempsey Road, this Greek-themed restaurant brings about a certain serenity. Food was excellent, especially the meat. They were well grilled by the chefs and each piece was palatable. I have never eaten a lamb quite like this. They entertained my little surprise birthday request for a birthday cake for my partner and that was greatly appreciated as it rounded up an excellent day! Will definitely visit this place again
5
It's exactly the kind of place which I would like to enjoy my Saturday lunch at. I really like the hummus and platter, they are delicious. The restaurant is generous with the food portion as well. A big plate of hummus for $5.90. The lamb chop that came with the meat platter is perfectly cooked. It's worth the visit
5
Food was good and the service even better. Great atmposohere. We enjoy very much and sure we will come back soon
5
The food is fantastic, service is excellent, ambience is nice. Cannot ask for more. Highly recommended restaurant. You would be remiss not to pay it a visit.
4
Cold cod dip was really tasty - highly recommended dish.
Grilled fish is seasonal and done well. Healthy dishes all round.
4
Loved the food. Wine was good too. It is casual dining but get a busy and it's almost like fast food. Service is definitely fast. If you are sitting outside you may be bothered by the people who smoke right at the entrance.
4
Fantastic greek food. Would recommend the eggplant dip, the sagnaki with fig jam and finally the Octopus.
4
I really enjoyed the experience. The food was good and the service was great. The waiters were very attentive to our needs. I would definitely return to this restaurant.
4
Back room can be very hot at noon. Ensure you got you reservation in the main restaurant . The food is always good
5
Although Blu Khouzina serves a good array of meat and seafood, they also have a good selection for vegetarian. We started the meal with a Greek salad and a hot cheese with Figs which was delicious. Then we had some pastry with spinach and a roasted Aubergine dip with bread. Lastly we tried their spinach rice as a main. Good quality food at good value prices
4
Well, when I've asked "why dolmas are so expensive, 25 SGD for 3 pieces, ex. service charge" an Indian national waiter in Singapore brought to me a plastic 0.5kg bag with rice in it, and said "Because rice is from Greece". It indeed had Greek-letters and some words on it, but it was on the same packet, written in English: "distributed by..." and address in Bulgaria. Quick google on that address in Bulgaria revealed a website that says they import Indian rice. The loop has closed up. It's just... GLOBALIZATION and SINGAPORE. The food is very good though
4
My niece took us to Blu Kouzina as a combined birthday lunch, On entry the place is very welcoming and looks similar to restaurants we visited in Greece. The seating was very comfortable and the restaurant was very clean, I liked that the kitchen was open, my niece had eaten here before, apparently on the other side of the bar there is more seating.I ordered the Wrap and Chips and it was very tasty, my partner and niece had Moussaka which my niece enjoyed but my partner was hoping would be better, then to our surprise my niece had organised a birthday treat and the staff sang happy birthday.The only negative I have was that the plates were being cleared too fast, we had to finish off our food as the plates were being taken away, we felt a bit rushed even though it wasn't busy, and the staff could be friendlier but they were Singapore friendly. I can see me going back there on our next Singapore visit
4
Been to Blu Kouzina a few times at their old location in Bukit Timah. First time to their Demsy restaurant.
Like the new set up. Food is excellent as usual.
5
My 5th visit and the quality was always the same for the lamp chops! Its as good as it gets! Gotta have them!
5
Very nice ambience, fast and good service and a large selection of plates. Many options for Vegetarians as well.
5
The food in Blu Kouzina is very delicious, the quality is as great as it was in Santorini. Good selection of dishes and portions are perfect size.
5
What a great place to have a nice lunch with girlfriends. Great food, ambience and service! Loved the cod roe dip!
4
Very cosy environment, friendly and fast service, good food. We liked the stuffed red peppers with feta and the lemon roasted chicken, and Greek youghurt as happy ending :)
2
I have dined at Blu Kouzina on several occasions, but on the most recent visit an otherwise good restaurant clearly did not get it right. We were seated a few minutes after 1900 and had our order in by 1915. The starters promptly arrived, which we enjoyed, and then the wait began. Our main course was not served until 50 minutes later. During that time the wait staff completely disappeared. At one point my wife had to get up and ask a waiter for another drink. We inquired about the status of our food twice and was told it was coming. It was only after I asked a third time for a firm indication of when the food would be ready or bring me the bill did the food arrive in about five minutes.By that point the evening has been all but ruined. This is all the more disappointing since we were out to celebrate mother's day. The server offered an unconvincing apology for the late food. However, that did not stop him from presenting me with the full bill with the service charge included. The service was nothing short of awful.I understand that sometimes things go wrong and that restaurants do not always get it right. That acknowledged, good restaurants that are serious about retaining customers make things right when things do go wrong. Unfortunately, Blu Kozina made no attempt to make it right; no gesture, no nothing. In fact, we were offered no explanation as to why our food was so late in arriving. So, in sum, the night was ruined and no attempt was made to make it right. Therefore, I will not be visiting again since it seems as if I am valued for my credit card rather than my custom
4
We went on Mother's Day with a reservation and had to wait for 20 minutes. And i understand it is soo busy that impossible to be a walk-in for this restuarant that can fit in 300 people at one go. The waiters were attentive and helpful. The food was nothing that i would say out of the world but prices are. (assume sgd50 pp as min). I think there were are some signature mix like the spinach rice we ordered. The basic hummus and pita dolmades were bland. Meat platter was good and would recommend. Will have to be big time tempted to be there
3
Been to Blu Kouzina last year, service was very good. This time, waiters were inattentive. When I came out from the toilet, appears that one of the waiter was clearing vomit from the sink and he had accidentally flicked vomit water at me. He apologised casually and continued with his job without checking twice. In the past, desserts were served at the end of the meal, which was a nice part of dining in Blu Kouzina and makes diners feel very welcomed. However, all we got at the end of the meal is the bill
4
Had lunch - food was great service excellent - the waiter helped us with portion sizes etc and when we ordered an extra salad it came very quickly ...... but the chairs! We sat outside so hopefully inside they are better. They were thin wobbly metal chairs with thin lumpy cushions on them. The other choice was a wooden chair that was so low the table wasn't at a good height to eat at. If you have a bad back this place isn't for you
4
An amazing place for the Meat Eaters. Authentic food in a charming surroundings. Can a bit noisy at times so try to sit outside and enjoy particularly on the weekends.
5
Food was excellent. Not more I can say.
Service was just ok. Atmosphere was ok. I recommend Blu if you want good food and not have visit McDonalds to fill up
4
The desserts definitely outstanding. Overall, quality food food served. We enjoyed the ambience. It was full house even at 2pm!
5
I visted this place few years ago when they were located in Bukit Timah. I visited the new place last Sat and it was still very good! The food was really healthy and nice. Of course the atmoshpere is really cool!
3
This was our first visit since the move to Dempsey (have previously eaten at the old Bukit Timah branch). Booked three weeks in advance, necessary for a Saturday evening. Had asked for an outside table, got led inside (away from the outside seating area), and told there was a further outdoors area. But that didn't appear so, we found ourselves in the conservatory. Not the best place for a couples dinner, surrounded by families with young children. Service was almost too speedy. The main course was brought up while we were still eating our starters. The waiter advised that the meat platter for two would be too big for the two of us (with starters) so we took his advice and ordered the platter for one. Which wasn't enough for two! Hence we also had deserts, the baklava was particularly disappointing... small, a little dry. Overall, just average
4
Service was very good. We were advised not to order the meat platter For two - too large for two of us. We had Cretan salad and houmous to begin. We had calamari and meat platter for one. Both were really good. Have been before and would definitely return again.
5
We booked Blu Kouzina for our 22nd wedding anniversary dinner, and we were not disappointed.The meal was amazing, the staff fantastic - with a little surprise at the end of the night "on the house", to say "Happy Anniversary" ! We cannot recommend this restaurant enough - and will be back.......soon!!
3
We went as 5 couples ( you need to reserve in advance ) on a weekend. The place was packed to the rafters and that was a part of the problem. It was hot as hell . Not the most pleasant experience eating while mopping the sweat off your face . Upon asking , we were told that the air conditioning is turned on max but the crowd was full hence it was hot ( more likely , a unit had broken down) but whatever be the reason , it was extremely uncomfortable. The food was great though with the lamb chops being really phenomenal. It has limited but adequate vegetarian options too . The quality of produce shows through , too bad the quality of the air conditioning does not .Price wise , it's not cheap ( none of the Dempsey establishments are ) but then for a fine dining experience, the prices are OK and the management should realize that for fine dining experience, having great food is only a part of the puzzle 
4
My wife and me wanted to have some Greek food, so the choice was Blu Kouzina.We made a reservation online and this went perfect.Upon arrival the waiter immediately brought us to our table.Restaurant is nicely decorated.We ordered a few starters and two main dishes.Presentation and taste of the food is really good.The problem was that all the food is served in a very short time, we didn't even finish the first starter when the waiter already brought the main dishes.You really feel like they are pushing you to finish asap so the table can be prepared for the next guest.This really made us feel uncomfortable and after I complained they took the main dishes back to the kitchen.Same thing happened at the table next to us, and I could see the frustration on the face of the other guests.This is not my idea of a dinner with my wife, we want to enjoy our food and enjoy the surroundings.This was really a pity because all other tings were perfect
4
Once they knew it was our Anniversary the service went up several notches. We were given a quiet table, served us compliment Prosecco wine & were unobtrusive but attentive at the same time. The food was amazing. Fresh ingredients, cooked to perfection & oh so tasty. Definitely coming back here.
4
The food was awesome, service is good, ambience is great! Ordered meat platter, it was grill to perfection. Also ordered the bbq prawn, though expensive but it was very delicious! Would return again to try other dishes.
5
Great food, excellent service and great atmosphere. We were looking for all those things for a regular catchup and we got it. Thanks
5
Really impressed by such good service, speed and Quality/Taste of Food.
Authentic Greek in an amazing environment.
Staff around all on good mood and offering the best service you could expected.
Very informal, relaxed location to enjoy good times with friends...

We have been there with another couple and enjoyed the food and the atmosphere. It is reasonably priced and the food and mezes are delicious. They need to enrich the dessert menu.

Let's just say that this is Singaporean style Greek restaurant... normally Asians may not know how to appreciate Greek food but I must reiterate that this one is a surprise... as I've been to a few Greek islands namely Mykonos & Santorini plus around and about Athens & the Acropolis a few times over my tenure in Singapore Airlines (been around the world hundreds of times over 13 years)... this one surprises you over & over with delicious morsels of Greek delicacies... my ex colleagues & international friends thought so too... particularly loved the Lamb Chops & Tazikis... my local favourite while partying on the Greek island One thing, however, training for their serving staff is gravely needed cos they thought it was French food or something. Hahahaha... Some of my new friends we shocked & a bit upset with their replies. Now, who says anybody can serve and know what they are serving at the same time without years of food knowledge or even been outside of Asia??? They need an international Restaurant manager Asap!!? Call me

We have not been to Singapore for a very long time, but now on our recent visit a treat at Blu Kouzina was an absolute must.The food was excellent as before - my personal favourite remain the Saganaki with figs, but all starters were a real treat. Having finished them, there was hardly any space left for the mains (meat) - a shame that we were not able to finish them.The new location really has a very special atmosphere and the owner Dennis really is making everyone feel welcome.Make sure that you reserve - we were there on a Wednesday and it was packed to the last place

I love Greek food, so when a friend of ours recommended it for a night out, I was really looking forward to visiting the Blu Kouzina. I've been told by many Singapore natives that it's hard to find good Mediterranean food in The Lion City and, based on this restaurant, I would say that is definitely true.There are two options for where to sit: the main room (which you first see upon entering), or the back "annex" where it's quieter. We chose the latter, which was also unfortunately quite hot (the multiple fans whirring overhead didn't seem to cool things down).The menu had the typical Greek fare: hummus and pita bread, taramasalata, tsatsiki, and the like. Our party of four ordered a little bit of a variety so that we could try a large assortment. Unfortunately, the portion sizes were very small, so everybody only got a small teaspoon or two of each. We had a couple of mains - Zucchini patties and stuffed vegetables - and they were "ok" - nothing to write home about.What most disappointed me was the "factory" feeling of the food delivery. Women with hair nets on (obviously from the kitchen) delivered our food in a rather impersonal manner.The drinks menu was authentically Greek (lots of Greek alcohol choices), but the prices were very high: the average drink was around $12 - $18 for a small glass.For four people, our bill was $400. There are other, better places to have good Greek food in Singapore. While I love the location of Blu Kouzina (be sure to walk around the neighborhood after your meal!), I wouldn't go back again

Have seen many reviews about this place and finally managed to get there last night with a friend. The food was soooooo good. We had a few mezzes and a main course of grill calamari between us and every dish was super fresh, super tasty and ridiculously moorish. Can't wait to go back
4
FIrst and my last visit to a Greek Restaurant. Just me. I don't really know how to appreciate the food but my colleagues commented that the food was awesome. Very expensive or maybe not as the restaurant was almost full for dinner. You decide by looking at the receipt I attached. The two jumbo grilled prawns not exactly jumbo came up to $33.80. Very painful although I was not paying for it. The photo showing prawns $33.80, octopus $39.80 and calamari $29.80 came up to $103.40. The meat platter for 2 was huge at $99.80. I would recommend you order the very tender lamb chops alone. Period. Service was attentive.
4
This is one of our family's favorite restaurant in Singapore. Using fresh ingredients, the food is very tasty always.However, the new restaurant in Dempsey, due to sound echos, is very noisy. Wish better sound absorption or proofing can be done. The original one near 6th avenue, although small, was very cozy and peaceful.
4
The vibe is great on a Sunday - the restaurant is full and bustling with people. The food is always good and the Greek wines on offer have something for everyone. Make a booking and enjoy the Greek cuisine and hospitality. Enjoy.
5
Blu Kourzina is the best Greek restaurant in town. Make sure to reserve your table a week in advance as it's always full. Scrumptious food, good service.
5
Okay there is a lot of competition in that category in Singapore! This restaurant is just cool, service is wonderful, ambiance and decoration makes feel you are in Greece. I had dinner there with a Greek Friend of mine and she was blown away by the quality of the food! The wine list serves mostly Greek wine which is okay. You can also bring something amazing for a cork fee of 25$. Everything is good there!!! Enjoy!!!
5
A little quirky seating outside but comfortable enough and the food was excellent!! I have been and enjoyed this new venue (from old Bukit Timah) a few times and was so pleased that the food had if anything this time stepped up.Greek wines only but with a little of their help we were not disappointed there either. Great evening
5
Went for lunch with my family. It is our second time there. The last time was more than a year ago. Despite the time that has passed, the experience was equally enjoyable if not better!! The food was amazing good, especially the Greek salad, Mousaka and Grilled Seafood. Had a wonderful time. Too bad no space for dessert!! Will definitely visit again soon
4
The restaurant changed its location to a new place into the center of Singapore, it became more louder and more cramped in the restaurant, and the tables are quite close together now. However the food as usual is great and a very nice variety of Greek wines
5
The food was awesome, the service staff not exactly very attentive (although there were many of them standing around), the music too loud which resulted in most customers having to shout to talk to each other. Felt more like a market place than a nice restaurant. But the food will make me want to go back.
5
Very good service and the place is really pretty and impressive! The staffs are very friendly and it can get really crowded during the lunch hour, even on the weekend. Food was good but a little oily in my opinion. Coffee was great. Will definitely visit again

Haven't been to Greece, tried Greek food in Sydney and Malta, but first time exploring Greek food in Singapore with my 2 foodie pals...this restaurant at Dempsey has a "tavern" look and very cozy..my pal said Greek food is healthy and hearty...so we ordered the following:(1) pita bread with various dips as starter (2) Greek salad (3) spanakopita (like a fried samosa) (4) moussaka - baked eggplant with minced meat...not heavy but adequate taste (5) lamb chop - tender, juicy and tasty (6) grilled beef kebab (7) grilled octopus tentaclesOverall the taste is fresh/refreshing and we need not add condiments or seasoning for tasting. Personally I recommend the Greek salad for its refreshing taste and the feta cheese, the lamb chop and grilled octopus tentacles, both the meat dishes are a MUST TRY, as they are tender, juicy and cooked to perfection.As you can read, Greek food is renowned for its health benefits, 3 of us did order a lot a lot to reap in the benefit
5
Blu moved fairly recently from its quaint, narrow dining experience on Bukit Timah Road to a more convivial setting atop Dempsey Hill, but luckily for all of us the food, service & drinks remain exceptional.Run by a Greek family who own an olive grove in Greece, the olive oils and some cheeses are imported from home.Blu has a wide range of choices for vegetarians, an extensive & delicious tapas menu, and an excellent wine list. Service is warm & prompt. You will NOT be disappointed by a visit here
5
Amazing food, staff and place! Can't wait to come back! The new restaurant is much bigger than the other but still is very cozy and nice.
5
First time to this new location at Dempsey. It's more spacious. Like the ambience. More service crew. They are very attentive. Good recommendation on food.
4
Went with a group of 5. Great ambience, service and food! I don't usually eat lamb but I loved Blu's. Location as is with Dempsey addresses is challenging to navigate.
4
Fabulous Greek restaurant. The food is sumptuous. It's expensive, but addictive. They do need more waiters there as the place gets very packed with people.
4
Visited for lunch and didn't disappoint. Really tasty greak food and a really varied menu. Ate a selection of cold and warm mezzes to start and then the souvlaki for main. Beef came out a little rare so go medium. Wine list also impressed and all Greek wines to add to the experience. Service was a little slow and brought a few incorrect items to the table, but only a slight blip.Would recommend
5
in recent trip to singapore we want to try something new, so we come across blu kouzina. so we book a table for 2. upon ordering our food, the superviser explain the menu and point out their specials and most sellable dishes. we ordered what was recommend, and we were happy with the choices. the cheese, the salad and the meat plater was so delicious. the service was great. the total bill was still reasonable. i surely recommend this to everyone. this place has a nice decor, excellent menu, reasonable price, great service.no wonder it's always pack
3
While there was still ample seating in the restaurant, my friend and I were served a corner alfresco table right next to some pots and plants... And mosquitoes. Is the water stagnant? I'm not sure, but the mosquitoes definitely had a better feast than we did. Food otherwise was average, not as good as I first remembered.
5
On top of Dempsey Hill in a nice residential area. The settings are beautiful with the typical white and blue colors of Greek islands. Great appetizers such as baked feta are a prelude to a great dinner. Mixed grilled meat platter for 2 is superb and the grilled sea bass tasted perfect. Good wines - Greek of course. I recommend it and will return. CIA
4
The dÃ©cor is the first thing that catches our eyes. Once we started ordering, food was served promptly.The greek salad had the most generous feta cheese from any restaurant I ever had! a huge block was dumped on top of salad instead of the usual finely chopped piece. Nice! mousakka with beef must be shared. Too much for a single diner. The seabass was fresh , comes with lemon sauce, similar to how it was done in the greekislands
4
This popular greek restaurant has a good set of fresh greek food including fish, shrimp, and squid. Its taste is as close and good as the greek food one in Greece. Go visit before sunset and spend time linger on the greenery area of Dempsey hill, the former military zone.
5
The dinner was excellent: fast and friendly service, amazing food and lovely atmosphere. Special kudos to John. We will definitely come back!
5
The Greeks have left and service level dropped!
The beef skewers and lamb were yum but we had to wait 30mins which was ridiculous and the place was not even packed as usual!
Hope service improves...
5
If you like good, authentic greek food this is great. The menu can be a little limited especially if you come often but the quality is always consistent with a great greek feel.Even though the restaurant has moved to the new location and is a lot bigger the two rooms work well.Drinks selection good and the greek wines surprisingly good
3
Nice ambience and service. I was having high expectation on the quality of food since I remembered the great experience I had previously at the Bukit Timah. However I was a little disappointed...the bread serve was not fresh and toasted. We ordered the meat platter and had mixed reviews. The lamp chops were done perfectly and delicious. The beef skewer wais not cooked consistently. We asked for medium done and some parts are overcooked. The meat balls and patty actually tasted the same and we were not a fan. The server was nice to change our side from French fries to roasted potatoes. However it tasted sour. Maybe it's a Greek style of cooking but we didn't eat after first bite. I personally will not order the platter again. The Greek salad is fresh and crunchy with generous serving of Feta cheese. We also ordered a special which was not on the menu: Feta cheese coated with sesame seeds grilled with Honey. It was yum yum.Though I have mixed reviews about the food, I will come back in the future but will definitely order a different dish
4
We went here for a friends birthday party and we were able to sample a lot of their delicious food! I wasn't the one who ordered so I'll just try to describe what we have as accurately. We started with pita bread and a few dips like hummus and tzatziki. I had to stop myself from eating the bread because it was so soft and good! Next we had the stuffed red pepper that my vegetarian husband really liked! I remember the meat dishes were outstanding as well. Especially the beef souvlaki and the chicken skewer!! It's a must try. Don't forget to get a baklava for dessert :-) I'm giving this place 4 stars instead of 5 because it's a bit on the pricey side but otherwise it's good!
5
Had the pleasure of visiting Blu Kouzina while in SIngapore - and what a gem. Delicious food, great atmosphere and lovely decor.The waiter also advised the party when they had ordered too much - and recommended we scale back to save money and waste; which was a lovely touch.Great, tender meat, and hummus to die for :) Will most certainly be back
5
A friend of mine says it's easy to rate 5 stars but the real question is, would you go back? The answer in this case is a definite yes. Everything was good, from the Greek beers to the hummus, the bread and the souvlaki. The calamari was melt-in-the-mouth.
3
We had the meat platter which consists of a piece of sirloin and piece of Fillet each approx 225 gm. It comes with French fries which are very good btw. The meat quality is ok but the spices? Really not sure they work best. Would be better to leave off and let diners add themselves. We also had a Greek salad as a side dish. It was excellent. Prices are ok for Singapore. Dempsey hill is a good place for Tourists to get away from the more " touristy side" of Singapore.
5
This restaurant serves the best Greek cuisine within Asia. I had been to Avra Greek in Bangkok recently but it is really not as good as the one in Singapore. Ever since, it was opened more than 5 years ago in bukit timah, the food in here has been consistently good and yummy. The price is definitely higher especially the Greek wine. Oh well wine and dine in Singapore has never been cheap. But if you really feel like good authentic Greek food, here is the place to be. Dips are good in flavor, the meat platter is tasty and cook perfectly. Meatballs, Moussanka and Baked spinach pie are as good as Greece. The restaurant only use Chope app to accept reservation since they are so busy to accept phone reservation or even to follow up with you. Even if there is empty table, it will be taken up fast. You need to have advance reservation within a week in order to get a table especially dinner and weekends
5
Blu always deliver! Service is great as usual. Waiters are friendly and the food is fresh and tasty. Simply loved the Greek salad with Generous portion of feta cheese! Freshly baked roll with green gold olive oil and sea salt is so simple but satisfying. The lemon chicken is juicy and very tender. The mouzakka portion is large and super yummy. Love the new location at Dempsey. As for the table layout, a bit too cluttered for personal comfort space. Apart from that, we thought we were back in Greece again.
4
Lovely Greek Restaurant on Dempsey Hill.
All the popular Greek Mediterranean food available, topped with excellent service. Food is delivered quickly and staff are friendly.
Great eating experience.
5
Simply the best Greek restaurant in Singapore! Sumptuous food, fresh and wholesome. Lovely decor. Attentive service. Book at least a week in advance for weekends.
5
Classic Greek restaurant. Must try seafood platter with grilled sea bass. Lovely dips and pita bread... tip: for 5-6 persons, get a small meat platter and a seafood platter for sharing. You won't regret it. Fantastic beef kebabs!
5
Went with a large group. Service was very attentive and gave great recommendations. Meat quality was very high, and portion sizes incredibly large. Nice Greek red wine, too. Will be back!
4
Love this new location! So much better then the old place. Ambiance is very good. Waiters are friendly. It feels like there is always a party going on.The food is very good. Grown up with this kind of food. So coming to this restaurant in an Asian country feels like coming home.
5
Food-excellent choice and qualityWines-wide range and good pricesAmbience-comfortable with high ceilings and an open kitchenService-always attentive and efficient from the time they first opened in Bukit Timah to the present Dempsey. HOWEVER, on our last visit, we were served by a staff who knew little about the wines and tried clumsily to show that he did. Another staff who brought our crockery and cutlery, literally wrapped his entire hands over the surface of the plates and cutlery before setting it down in our places. Reminds me of a waiter serving a bowl of soup with the thumb dipped into the soup
4
My wife and I were in Singapore and wanted to have dinner with my nephew and his wife. They booked dinner at this lovely restaurant in Dempsey Road, a popular area.It was raining cats and dogs all evening but we managed to get there in time ( 9 pm ). The restaurant was really busy so we had to wait a few minutes for our table. Finally they offered us one outside on the veranda. As it was a pleasant temperature, we agreed. We ordered several starters and appetisers and actually never reached the main course as we were so full already. Everything tasted great and we thoroughly enjoyed the evening. The service was also very prompt and friendly
5
Blu Kozina is one of my favoursite restaurants that serve good food. The waiters there give good advice on portions and their olive oil is very fresh. I am disappointed they stopped serving balsamic vinegar to go with the olive oil to make the dinning experience complete.
5
Born and raised in a coastal city of the Mediterranean Sea, I appreciate authentic Mediterranean food and hospitality. Blu provides great Greek food and warm Greek hospitality. Nice ambiance and almost always full.Don't miss the opportunity to become friend with the team. Dimitris Fokas knows how to pamper his regular guests. Advice! Call in advance especially on weekends and holidays to make a booking. Recommendation: Consider more of authentic Greek musi
4
Following the move to Dempsey, the food continues to be very good. The dips are scrumptious, the salads fresh, and the seafood and meat dishes flavourful. Good selection of Greek wines, including a mean ouzo by the glass. The waiting staff are friendly and efficient, but could pay more attention to detail, Prices are on the high side, but the experience is pleasant, so you won't feel cheated. So is its success that the restaurant is often full. If you show up at lunch without reservation, there may not be a table; on the other hand, it could be only half empty; the problem is the staff often don't pick up the phone, and the system sends you an sms that takes you to Chope; on the day, Chope does not make reservation and asks you to contact the restaurant directly
4
If you are looking for some good Greek food look no further, good service and good menu. If you are there for lunch or dinner make sure you book it does get full. enjoy the food.
5
Phenomenal food-- exceptional service and good ambiance all at a reasonable value--- will definitely return!
3
Very nice ambience, very beachy, casual... located in Dempsey Hill along with other great restaurants too..
But tastes are very average and feels like food is prepared way ahead and hsnlost its Flavours..
5
Amazing food amazing staff. The owner stands and inspects every dish that goes to the tables. He is so meticulous it's not funny. Been coming to Singapore along time but my first time trying this Resturant, I highly recommend this restaurant and in great area of Singapore.
5
Finally made it to the new location of Blu at Dempsey. Easy to access and simply love the Greek setting. There's ample space now and the section out back reminds us of Greece. The food as usual was fast to serve and tastes just the same as the days in Bukit Timah location. Service is extremely friendly and attentive. We enjoyed the Greek salad, meatballs and Seabream was extremely fresh and served to perfection. Kids had great conversations throughout dinner without electronics....except for me typing away on this review.
5
A charming Greek restaurant. It has a lot of tables so you'd maybe be able to turn up on spec. There is a large dining space to the rear as well as the main restaurant. Two of us shared Greek salad, fried cheese with fig dressing and one beef souvlaki. The Greek salad was delicious ....swimming in extra virgin a Greek olive oil and topped with a full block of feta with a sprinkling of oregano. The fried cheese was wonderful and the souvlaki had six large chunks of beef cooked perfectly to order. They do one wine by the glass and it was perfect with the Greek food. Loved this place
5
Wow what a wonderful night with great ambience and food. My husband and me are on holidays from Perth this is our second time in Singapore and didn't know about Dempsey Hill till now. Our waiter John was so friendly and efficient highly recommend this place can't wait to go back Thank you Coniglios
3
Blue Kouzina was/is my favourite restaurant in SIngapore as I love Greek food and this offers as authentic as it gets. However this visit was a bit of a disappointment to put it mildly - bread was cold, so many service personnel milling around but none will respond unless you signal two or three times. Ran a bill of over $200 but the usual complimentary dessert was missing.
5
First time visit to this restaurant. Liked the simple, fresh food- tasted authentic and excellent - as well as the atmosphere.Service was attentive despite the place being packed on a weekend night. Portions were good.Pricewise, be prepared for the usual markup on European food in Singapore -in Greece, the same meal should cost half of the price or so. Still, well worth to repeat
5
"Best Greek food outside of Greece" is how this place has been described by a Greek friend. Being a Greek foodie and having been to Greece multiple times myself, I definitely agree. Love the food, the atmosphere, and the service. We go about once every 2 months (would go more often but without proper planning, it's nearly impossible to get last-minute reservation on weekends) and the owner would sometimes give us free dessert. We get the same things every time: selection of dips (the taramosalata is the best!), moussaka, grilled meat platter, and octopus
5
Managed to get table for 2 at short notice and a real treat. Great meats especially beef souvlaki but best part was service. Didn't let us order too much and offered half servings ... can't wait to go back
5
A great place for Lebanese and Greek food, nice boutique ambiance , simple food and great service . all the food was so delicious.Must visit if you like this cuisine .
5
The best greek food in town. Never let me down. Staff is ready to help. Must try at beatutiful restaurant.
5
After being living 3 years in Greece, what a surprising find such good quality and authentic flavors, ingredients and preparation of Greek dishes in Singapore.
All mezes, salads and main courses are really good.
I will be back for sure ...
4
Best Greek I've had since moving to Singapore. Wide assortment of appetisers and entrees. Decor inside restaurant is cute, very Santorini. The people running the restaurant are extremely friendly and knowledgeable.
4
the restaurant has moved from Bukit Thima to Dempsey for a much bigger place. But the food is still as good as before, maybe even better. Try the stuffed veggies, or the grilled sardines. yummy.Great wine list too. Service is very warm. And flexible for your orderings. keep it up
5
This place is seriously good. I've been here 3 times, and every time i come, without fail, it is packed with people. Not only that, but as an avid Greek foodie, this place nails it in every single way. The staff does an incredible job and the service is great
3
There is no doubt about it they serve excellent greek food here. We booked and went before Christmas with the family. We had an early evening booking and we were seated as far away from the entrance as you can be. In the non air-conditioned part, right at the back. It seemed a little bizarre as the whole place was pretty empty. So the ambiance wasn't great, the service was fast and the wait staff helpful but the meal was done in an hour. We just felt that with the change of location it had lost a little of what really made the restaurant special
5
Great atmosphere food and service. Obviously mums cooking is always going to be hard to beat. This comes pretty close. Saganaki with figs was 5 star as was the fava to start with. Beef souvlaki was great as well. No room for desert. Probably next tim
4
Went in a large group of 8. Loud and cramped, but the food made up for it - the breads, meat, seafood, salads were delicious and oh so fresh. We ordered the moussaka, meat platter, prawns, octopus, pita bread, 3 types of salad, alcohol. Bill was quite reasonable considering we couldn't eat everything we ordered, and had to doggy bag - the portions were quite large. Staff - attentive and prompt despite the restaurant being full to the brim. Will be back!Definitely not the place for romantic dates, but excellent for families, work related do's, large groups, etc.Definitely book ahead
5
One of our fav haunts in Dempsey road - it has a great ambience esp in the skylit area. And the food is great. Loads of options for everyone including vegans and vegetarians. Book in advance esp on weekends
3
Staff was very helpful esp. Mark. The food was generally decent except the sea bass which was tasteless. However, it wasn't a pleasant dining experience to eat under the heat. Can you fix the aircon please?
5
Staff were friendly, explained in detail the food menu, what portion is required for the pax of 10 we had. Food was delicious, ambience was great
5
It's a lovely place, the service is great, and the food is simply delicious! Prices are reasonable given the quality. Highly recommend.
5
A real Greek experience in Singapore!Food is amazing and everything is well prepared!An amazing Greek food experience not to be missed!
5
The food was great at Blu Kouzina and the service was jovial and friendly. Best yet, they gave us a free bottle of wine at the end of the night for no reason!
4
A friend of mine told me to try here. We were only in Singapore for 1 night,so I booked in advance. Good job I did. This is not a small restaurant,but it was heaving! Admittedly,it was the Tuesday before Christmas,but they are doing a great trade. Traditional Greek Fare. Good food ,big portions. Our waitress was a bit aggressive ,but got the job done. Glad we went
4
Good selection of Greek food. The rice wrapped in vine leaves was the best I've had. Had that before at other places and it was bitter but these are great. Right texture with just a tiny crunch. But it's a bit on the expensive side.Would go back
4
Favorite Greek place to go to for yummy dips and warm pita. I'd probably literally just go here for the eggplant dip it is SO good. Did you know that they only use olive oil from their own plantations (in Greece?) The grilled octopus is good too. Though to be honest, the meats leave much to desire..
5
This is a very good choice in Singapore if you plan to sample Greek cuisine. From salads, appetizers, mains and desserts, the staff can recommend choices that will suit your diet. The grilled meat and seafood platters are excellent! The pita breads are very warm and fresh! Ingredients used are very fresh. Ambience is casual. Huge selection of wine. Very crowded in the evenings, definitely should make reservations if you plan to dine there. This restaurant used to be located at Dunearn road at Bukit Timah area, they are in Demsey now. Enjoy
4
Beautiful set up and very courteous staff. We were there for our anniversary dinner and were surprised with a complimentary dessert platter. Thank you!!
4
Grilled octopus was very good. Feta cheese salad was also very good. The restaurant is casual and cozy. Lots of meat to please meat lovers.
5
One of our favourite resturants in Singapore!! Fantastic service, amazing Greek food and an authentic atmosphere. You will love this place and keep coming back. Highly recommended for a night out for dinner with friends or a romantic meal.

Reserved for 4 outdoor.
This place is a renowned place in Dempsey. Very popular so booking required. The food is very good and served very generously. Good service. Meat especially are amazing
3
The restaurant is OK.Some pieces of food like the Olive oil, pita, Greek salad are nice. But I am a bit disappointed by the feta that just looks like the industrial one you can get in the supermarket. All plates were too Salty as far as I am concerned. The service was fine except one waiter that was clearly upset against the world and we were unlucky to be served by him. The rest were ok.
1
Had heard a lot about Blu Kouzina from the previous location so was looking forward to going. 3 bread rolls between 5 people, mediocre olive oil, minute portions of very ordinary meals, very inattentive and bored waiting staff, cold coffee and a huge bill. Totally hyped. Don't bother. Will not be returning.
4
We arrived before 12pm (restaurant opening time) and were not able to enter as they were still preparing. Took a seat outside and subsequently got shown to our table. Service staff were great and attentive. I had a 3 year old with me and she wanted to sit in a regular chair but too short and the staff went to get her a toddler's chair which I really appreciated. Food was hit and miss. We ordered a mix of dips, pita bread, moussaka, grilled octopus and greek salad. Dips were great, the complimentary bread was really good and fresh from the oven, way better than the pita bread. Moussaka was so so. Beef was dry and it tasted quite ordinary. The grilled octopus was yummy but pricy. The greek salad was super fresh and a huge piece of feta cheese came with the salad. I would still visit this restaurant and try other items on the menu.

My father, wife and son went for lunch. We last went to this place about 3 years when it was located in Bukit Timah. Now that its moved closer to where we live we decided a return visit was a must. Reservations too are a must as the place is busy, luckily we had made them. There are 3 sections to the place, the front porch, the inside, then the back area which is covered but with open windows and fans. The back is the best and where we luckily were placed.The menu has plenty of good options, the prices were a bit high but the portion sizes were consistently generous and the food quality was outstanding. For starters we ordered beef meatballs, smoked eggplant and grilled feta. Everything was delicious! For the mains, my father and I decided to split a grill platter, my wife ordered prawns. Our 6 year old was going to share the meat platter given that he's quite the little carnivore!Again, the food was simply excellent. For my father's taste we ordered the meat Medium cooked though I prefer Rare or Medium Rare, but we received good portions of meat done perfectly. My wife's dish was also good.The dessert options were somewhat limited. Ice cream for junior, the wife opted for Greek coffee and skipping the clichÃ©d baclava, my father and I decided to split a Galaktoboureko which is a pair of pastry shells filled with cream. It was delicious! My new favorite! My wife didn't care for Greek coffee because it had the coffee grains still in there. The service was just excellent overall and we were warmly and efficiently looked after. There was an inexplicable delay in getting and paying our bill which was completely at odds with the rest of our service experience. Other than the irritation this caused our waiting Grab driver, it didn't otherwise dampen our wonderful afternoon. Margarita's has always been our long-standing Dempsey area favorite, I think Blu Kouzina may just have become our next default Dempsey dining destination
2
We were so disappointed in the new location for Blu Kouzina at Dempsey. Although some of the dinner was good , the ambience and the service was just not up to par. It's noisy, crazy busy and the wait staff is not helpful. Seems like they are trying to do too much too soon and gone is that personalized service from their previous location at Bukit Timah.Sadly, we will not be returning.

Restaurant Blu Kouzina has moved it's location from Bukit Timah Road not too long ago, to join the cluster of restaurants that are in the charming Dempsey Area. In the past I have heard positive comments about this Greek Restaurant when it was still at it's old location, but I had never been there to dine. I was told then that the food was very good and the decor of the place nice.In it's present location ( Dempsey ) I was there twice in October, once for dinner with my husband and the second time for lunch with friends. In order to give my fair judgement on this restaurant, I decided not to write this review till after my second dining experience . The Food was undoubtedly good , Service was very attentive and selection of wines acceptable.However, the dining experience was not entirely enjoyable for me for these reasons : WHY BLU KOUZINA DID NOT QUITE MAKE THE GRADE * The restaurant is sandwiched between two alfresco dinning areas, one in the front main entrance with a seating capacity for about 20 persons and one at the rear end of the restaurant seating about 50. There was a constant flow of traffic both ways through the main dining room to and from the alfresco areas passing by our table and others along the passage way. The ones set up against the wall on the raised platform are better protected from this traffic flow.* The small tables in the long, narrow dinning floor area, are set up too close to each other, that conversation from neighbouring tables is clearly audible. * Ambience is sorely lacking. I couldn't help feeling like I was dining in an up-market Canteen instead of a restaurant . It is not a place where one can sit in comfort to linger on a little longer for after dinner drinks, coffee and conversation. In my opinion good food when enhanced with good service and the right ambience, successfully makes for a satisfying and delightful dinning experience. As of now, I shall give Blu Kouzina a miss

Love the greek food served to me at this place. Great service and they even offered me desserts to celebrate my birthday! Awesome :)
5
This is a super nice place to go for dinner with friends. Best greek food. Very authentic, good quality, and great taste. highly recommended
4
This was one of our regular Favourite eateries while living in Singapore . Make sure you phone ahead to book as they are often fully booked .
5
Delicious juicy tender Souvlaki. Tiger prawns were yummy. Although we were in the non-aircon seats at the back, it was still comfortable at lunch time.
4
Went for a nice evening dinner and drinks with friends, the service was splendid and food delicious. We ordered a meat platter - which was just right for the palate. The wine was good too. A wonderful experience, would like to visit again.
5
I was tempted to just call this place "very good," but the service is so good that I had to give it an Excellent. We had fish, some salad, a few vegetable side dishes and a bottle of cheap and cheerful white greek wine. Everything was completely excellent and the wait staff are completely on the ball and fully attentive - which is not always there case here in Singapore. Whoever is in charge has made a big effort to get the whole team to work seamlessly together and its nice to see a place make this extra effort. There is a reason why this place is almost always packed
1
Unfortunately our visit was characterised by poor service throughout - having to ask to order, get up and find staff to enquire about mains, and we sat for 15 mins waiting to order from the dessert menu. At that point we were aggressively told we needed to leave to make space for the second seating and we should have been faster. We cancelled dessert orders and asked for the bill without any service charge, as service had been missing throughout. They refused to do so, brought us the full bill ($500 for 4) and said that we could go and find the manager to discuss if we desired. Blu kouZina, normally the manager would come to the patrons when there is an issue like this, and to give yourselves a mandatory tip for poor service isn't excusable. We live here, and class this as one of the poorest experiences we've had in Singapore. I would not recommend you spend your time or money here when there are so many great options on Dempsey hill

Blue Kouzina is located in Dempsey Hill, an area in Singapore that exudes old world charm and tranquility - cut off from bustling city. The place was quite crowded when we stepped in. The beginning was disappointing as the bread was hard and didn't seem very fresh. Domain Mercouri red wine was quite good.Keftedes meat balls. tasted just ok - and to make matters worse we found a small piece of plastic in one of them. Melitzanosa lata , an eggplant dip, tasted good. The best item was grilled Sea Beam. We ended the meal with Ouzo shots, the popular Greek anise flavoured aperitif 
3
The food in this restaurant is fabThe service is friendly (Front of house staff may benefit from some further training Re their product - e.g. to help them gain better familiarity with the whole menu, they waiters had limited knowledge of what was available on the menu or wine list. Re customer service - friendliness is an important part but not the whole of what makes good customer service. please consider some formal training in this area
4
Hands down the best octopus we have had in Singapore. Here in Blu Kouzina. Everything else was pretty authentic too - the keftedes, beef kalamaki and lamb chops. And the restaurant is very busy on weekend nights; there's a lot of buzz and chatter in the air, so do not come here for a quiet, romantic and intimate dinner. Larger groups abound and everyone here seems to be having a great time. Despite the crowd, service was prompt, upbeat and friendly. Prices are on par with restaurants of the same category here in Singapore, ie on the slightly higher end
4
Pretty decent setup. feels like homely Greek city. Great service. Nice menu and friendly staff. Good location to have dinner and relax your Friday night.
5
I prefer the smaller family run restaurants to the larger ones and Blu Kouzina is a gem. I've eaten here more than 3 times and it always has been immensely satisfying. There is a large selection for vegetarians and the owners are very helpful.
4
The taste of food is really rich! A little bit salty, but tasteful.
The service is wonderful. I will come back for sure.
4
Highly recommend Blu Kouzina for good Greek food. It certainly didn't disappoint the visit, the food was delicious, and there is emphasis on quality of ingredients and good service. Prices are a little on the higher side. I have no problems with the prices though, given that the quality is consistently good and service is prompt and attentive with well-trained friendly staff. Once again Staff are attentive without being intrusive and the food was delightful. A very pleasant way to spend Saturday evening. I will definitely go back
3
I have been to this restaurant when it was in Bukit Timah. Nice ambience then. Now at Dempsey Road, it has still maintained its ambience well. I had moussaka, grilled octopus, sea bass and beef skewer. They were ok but not outstanding as before. We had 4 beers and the bill as about 250 dollars
5
Highly recommend to make reservations more than a week in advance for weekends. My husband and I were seated promptly after stating our reservation. Waiter suggested a triple dip sampler which was about $30. We ordered the meat sampler for 2 pax for about $100 despite the waiter's advice that it was a dish enough for 4 people. True enough, we could only finish a little more than half of the dish. Meat was flavorful. Service was prompt and friendly. Atmosphere was noisy but cosy and cheery. I even noticed that there were staff/runners waiting at the service area, which was manned by one manager, to bring out the piping-hot dishes once they were ready so they did not sit on the counter for more than a few seconds. Overall, a very pleasant dining experience at a well-managed restaurant
5
We went for dinner to celebrate my husband's birthday. The setting is beautiful and the service impeccable.The food is amazing and portion sizes are good for sharing. We ordered a variety of appetizers and were so full that we went straight to desserts then !!!They even brought a beautiful dessert with a candle for my husband,We would definitely recommend this place for authentic and delicious Greek food 
2
LOVED the old location. The new place is, well, Singaporean. Yes it's smart and the food is good but the lack of Greek staff (tip: try at least to be able to speak some Greek) ruins the place. Atmosphere was flat, no traditional Greek post meal desserts or drinks (I've never eaten in a Greek restaurant before without a small free dessert or digestiv) and the general lack of customer service shows. Example: table for three. But only TWO bread rolls. Table for three - but had to ask repeatedly for three glasses.The place WAS special but now it's the same as anywhere here: turn the tables and avoid customers at all costs.VERY is appointing from three guys who all before used to worship the place
5
After hearing many a good story about this Resturant I finally managed to eat there recently. It certainly didn't disappoint!! We ordered a bunch of starters from the menu and specials board. They were so good that the conversation seemed to fizzle out as everyone concentrated on the food! The service was good, the waiters friendly, the beer was cold. No complaints at all apart from filling up too quickly! Will definitely be back again and soon!
5
another boisterous evening - this time family, and close friendsI was slightly apprehensive before dinner, as it was my family's first meal here, and they were very curious as to why this is my favourite restaurant in SingaporeNeedless to say, the meal was flawless - what I particularly appreciated was that the dishes were served in the correct order, dishes and plates cleared away between the courses, and...the food was perfectly cooked/prepared!the grilled meat was perfectly seasoned and grilled, and the grilled bream and sea bass were utter perfection..I really don't know how they do it..I have dined here many times, each time feeling a little nervous when the grilled fish is served, yet it is always perfectly seasoned and cooked..bravo!the generosity of Dennis Tsakiris knows no bounds: besides the complimentary desserts, my wife and guests staggered out of the restaurant with gifts of sea salt, mountain herbal tea and oreganoIs it any wonder that whenever I am in Singapore, which is several times a month, I have to consciously refrain from dining here each time, as I want to keep this experience as special as possibl
5
All typical Greek dishes (both meat and fish) are well cooked and the service is also great. Christos is a very good host and although a bit pricey, this place is definitely worth visiting.
4
Went for lunch with 7 veg friends.
Had a super time.
Excellent service.
Uncomfortable chairs.
Poor wine.
Rest was all superb.
Had a lovely Sunday lunch.
John was very good to us.
Must visit.

Must eat the following: the Greek Salad with Feta (one of the best outside Athens I ever had) and their grilled Squid - again one of the finest and best!
5
We had a great dinner with a group from the office. We just grazed on the different small plates which were delicious. Great service and atmosphere too.
4
The ambience is very very nice. Service is not bad but room for improvement if they are more attentive. Prices abit on the steep side. Fresh seafood like fish and prawns but the squid is too tough. Tables too small that we have to squeeze all our food. This has deterred us from ordering more dishes as there were 5 of us and we had wanted to try more different dishes being our first time. However did not feel like because there was not enough space
4
Very good authentic Greek cuisine....loved the kolokithokeftedes (zucchini fritters) spanakopita (filo pastries) & bougiourdi (stuffed red peppers)....the rest was great as well ! Service was good but the waiters were a tad to pushy & tried to hurry when we had an entire two hours....ended up finishing our meal in just over an hour :(Love the ambience but food presentation could improve :
5
First time at the Demspey location. We visited with friends on a Friday evening. Restaurant was packed but food came quickly and service was good. Food as fresh as ever. Grilled Octopus excellent. If you're not used to Greek food you may find the meats over-salted, but it's the same in Greece, so no need to complain about this
1
With such good reviews, we were looking forward to a nice dinner to wind down after a long week. But the service here was pretty bad, am quite disappointed. Not just one but two servers had poor attitudes. Its almost like they are upset to have customers right from the receive at the doorway + obvious exasperation at having to serve. Unfortunately, the experience killed alot of joy from the decent food. Price is on the high end. Will not be returning, or recommending
3
I've rarely been to Greek restaurant so it's hard to review if the food is authentic. I love the lamb chop, which is juicy and tender with good seasoning. The beef wrap (cannot recall the name) is also nice but Grilled octopus is too salty. Price is relatively high.The view and atmosphere is relaxing, but if you are expecting the high end romantic experience I would say you may be disappointed. My friend loves this place a lot, but for me I will hesitate if I will revisit. Think it's much depending on your own preference
5
I had the best taramosalata at Blu Kouzina! Even better than what I had in Athens. It was a delicious dinner in general. The feta cheese in the Greek salad is generous! I was in 7th heaven! We ordered dolma, the grill platter for one, and the baklava. All were delicious. Best Greek restaurant in Singapore
5
Second time around ... Still as good as last time. Lots of variety for vegetarians and in a really cool part of Singapore - Dempsey Hill. Service not quite as attentive this time as the first ...
5
Best Friday ever! Staff attends to needs really fast. Very good food in a very relaxed space. Made the birthday celebration of my friend something to remember.
5
Visited for lunch... Their starters with Pita get your juices flowing - and they have a great variety .. The warm oven-baked bread with Greek olive oil & crushed black pepper was reminder of how simple food can still be fabulous !! Must go regularly....
4
Had been to the place for a business dinner. Food was too tasty, they were serving foods back to back. Little overpriced but a good experience at the end.
Place is too crowded. Avoid walk in.
4
Great food, amazing taramasalata lamb and squid! Love the new Dempsey location. Service was a little slow but overall we love it at Blu Kouzina
5
The atmosphere, food, and staff are amazing, very rich in flavor Greek food, and deserts.
You will enjoy many selections of meat, Mediterranean appetizers, and tasty deserts like baklava.
You need to book in advance usually it's very crowded.
4
We tried many dishes and all of them were very good to my opinion. I would recommend the moussaka and their dessert for which I forgot the name (cinnamon pastries). Coffee and Ouzo were also excellent. One thing I regret is the restaurant display. It would be nice to have less tables so that waiters don't bump into your chair every five seconds. Also, more organization about waiters team would be great. I have been asked 5 times for how many people I booked (twice when at the reception while waiting for my table and three times while at the table)
4
We had been to the old place and this was our first time at the new location. We ordered our old favorites and they were as good as before. Service was efficient and fast. A bit disappointed to order a jasmine tea and to be served a can, and it wasn't cheap, for this kind of restaurant you expect a bit more and how much trouble is it to put some tea in a pot. otherwise a very yum lunch Ina nice restuarant
4
...the friday night my wife and I visited was bedlam. were seated outdoors, which was okay, but the constant press of stressed-out waitstaff took a lot of the fun out of things. still, the food was terrific: we had recently returned from a week in greece and had been looking forward to tasting some of our recent memories. were not disappointed - in fact it was frustrating not to be able to order more! we had the grilled octopus, smoked eggplant, grilled chicken breast...all were beyond delicious. were also really impressed by the wine list -- which has got to be the most fairly-priced restaurant list in all of singapore. and greece has great wines! do yourself a favor and give some a try. at these prices you can't go wrong. we will definitely return...maybe next time on a weeknight tho. very highly recommended.
5
There are so many dining establishments in Singapore now that it usually takes a while before we do return visits to the ones that we really liked. The food at Blu Kouzina has been consistently good and service is prompt. The wine list is Greek-focused and all the recommendations have been good and very affordable. On top of that, their new location at Dempsey Hill is closer to the city - yay! These guys have a winning formula, bookings advised as the place is always full
5
All the food recommendation by the service staff were really delicious. Service was good, very attentive and smiley despite the many requests from our table.
4
I took a group of my team for a relaxing dinner and it was just what we needed. Excellent food. The Greek salad with feta is great along with the lamb platter which was done to perfect. Comfortable relaxed service. Will be back
4
Good atmosphere had a very nice house wine and had enough variety for vegetarians. Don't go and try your luck as walkin make reservations in advance.
2
Busy saturday night, place is crowded, noisier than a train station. Service nice, but too fast, way too fast... Starters arrived less than 5min after order, giving a fast food impression... Taste wasn't really there. Overall feeling of being rushed. Totally unsuitable for a couple dinner in my opinion. All this for a high price...Will I be back? Hell no
3
The food was good, as expected... But a lot of little things disappointed us... First a really noisy room, not the quiet atmosphere we were expecting. Then the service was super slow and did a few mistakes (for which we had a discount on the final bill... 8$ on a 400$ bill...). And the food, even if good, seemed a bit simple sometimes for the price (like this yogurt + honey at 17$...). Overall not a bad evening but I don't think we will come back.
5
When you go to Blu kouzina, don't be afraid of picking anything in the menue, everything you'll take will be tasty. I strongly recommend the moussaka, grilled eggplant, grilled squid, a classic feta salad and Greek dips (Tsatsiki, tarama...). At the Dempsey restaurant, I recommend to have diner outside, the indoor is very noisy
3
The food is fine but it is hard not to feel you are being gouged when you order a mezze platter of three dips for 30 dollars that doesn't come with any pita. For four people, you will need to order two times the pita. Seriously? We spent 2 weeks in Greece and this never happened. Come on Blu Kouzina. You can do better
5
This lovely authentic Greek restaurant never disappoints. It's new larger location at Dempsey is just as good as the original. The food is fresh, imaginative and delicious. The place has a real buzz about it and the staff are attentive and helpful. The owner is always on hand with advice and suggestions. We often leave our choices to him. We visited for my daughters birthday and one of our guests was vegetation and gluten free - but this still presented no problems, and her food was equally delicious.
5
Came here with family to celebrate our wedding anniversary. Totally yummy! Service was brilliant and they helped us choose and advised us well when they saw we were having trouble making a decision!Also came here for a large gathering a friend organized and we took over the whole back canopy area. Again highly recommended for events
4
I used to go to their Bukit Timah place, which was always full and reservations were needed to guarantee a table. They have since moved to Dempsey to a much bigger and more comfortable place with a nice ambiance.If you are craving for some Greek cuisine, this is the place. to go. What I appreciated most in my last visit is their helpfulness in selecting the appropriate menu item for our group. We were a group of 4 and we were ordering the meat platter for 4 people. The waiter said, since we are ordering other menu items, the meat platter for 4 might be too much for us and suggested that we order instead the meat platter for 2. Now, that is real customer service. The owners are also present overseeing and helping take care of their customers.Make sure you call beforehand to ensure a table
3
The best thing about this place is the decoration. The fries were disappointing, and they were out of octopus...
4
I thoroughly enjoyed my team dinner here! It was packed even on a Thursday night but the service was definitely not lacking! The food was splendid as well - anything on the menu is probably worth ordering. Will definitely be back (:
5
The place is beautifully decorated, which makes you feel in a unique environment. Service was fast, although they could be a bit more attentive. I arrive when my friends were already on the table, drinking, and waiters didn't bring additional glasses until we asked for them. Food: wonderful. For starters we had Greek pan fried cheese with figs on top, which was just unbelievably tasty. Then we had a mixed meat platter, where the lamb chops stood out. So tender and perfectly cooked. They make their own olive oil, which you have to try, as it's so different from 99% of the ones you find for sale.Try this food by yourself and thank me later
4
Blu Kouzina is a very successful restaurant with always full occupancy every nite. Reservations a week ahead are required sometimes. The Greek food is delicious and authentic but their new location at Dempsey is like a big canteen and lacks the cosy ambiance of the old venue at bukit timah! Nevertheless, it hasn't hurt their business one litlle bit probably because dempsey is a great location and parking is ample and free around there. My favourite dishes here are their grilled fish (600gm is big) and their mixed grilled platter (big enough for 3-4 people to share). It is still a fun place despite the big canteen like atmosphere. Perhaps if the lighting could be slightly dimmer or softer, it will feel more intimate and cosy
5
Came here on a busy evening and what a fantastic experience! The couple we had dinner with are regulars and order a whole assortment of food and every single dish was outstanding! The staff were wonderful and the food was the best Greek food I have tried. The atmosphere in the restaurant was lovely and laid back and every table was laughing, talking and genuinely looking like they were enjoying their food! Would definitely recommend if ever in Singapore. Not to be missed
5
If you love Greek food like I do then Blu Kouzina is the place to go. The food is so light and tasty and every mouthful makes you want to go back for more! The service is very good and the food comes out very quickly. If you have a big group the share platters are the way to go so that you can try a few things. It won't be the cheapest Greek food you've ever had but you will love it! They are always busy so best to book a table to avoid missing out
5
We've been fans of Blu Kouzina on Bukit Timah ever since it opened - many a times celebrating birthdays there. Our only complaint was that it was hard to get a table last min, especially on weekends, if you didn't book early enough. Finally, Blu Kouzina moved to a bigger venue @ Dempsey Hill. We called early evening to make a reservation for 830pm on a Friday night and were thankfully given a go-ahead to come on down. The restaurant has many more tables in a much larger space across one floor now (outdoors, indoors in aircon and an indoors-outdoor terrace in a tent with air coolers). We did miss a bit of the old, quieter, cozy charm of the restaurant but when we walked in the majority of the tables were full and there was definitely a buzz in the air. We sat in the back indoor-outdoor tent area and while the space was large, it did not feel like there was not enough attention to service. In fact, it occasionally became a bit warm despite the air coolers being on full blast and one of the tables next to us complained a bit. The manager and staff promptly got a chair, found a table fan lurking around the restaurant and placed it right next to their table to appease them. Haven't seen this sort of on-the-spot thinking from managers or staff where customer satisfaction comes first. In my opinion and humble experience, most restaurants would just shrug their shoulders and say this is the coolest they can go. Going to the food, we ordered an appetiser of Dolmades, which was brought out promptly. I suspect these are ready made and served as & when ordered. However, the taste was good - not too bitter and not too oily. For mains, we ordered the Grilled Prawns (2 pcs), Beef Souvlaki and Lamb Chops (done medium) with lemon potatoes and a portion of the spinach rice. Just a tip of having meat in Singapore - restaurants in general always tend to slightly overcook it compared to your request so if you like it done medium, ask for medium rare. For medium well, ask for medium, etc. We were all extremely content and happy with our choices. The portions were large enough to fill us up but not waste, and the taste was superb. The lamb chops have quickly become my favourite lamb chops in all of Singapore as they were very tender and had decent chunks of unfatty meat on the 3 chops, though I suspect the tangy lemon potatoes have a lot to do with it as well. For drinks, we ordered their half bottle of red @ ~$40, which paired well with our mean and gave us a neat 2 glasses or so each. Good taste and value for money. We didn't try the desserts but I was really surprised and happy to see that they had Galaktaboureko on their menu - one of my favourite desserts from my vacation in Greece and my short time in Astoria, NY. Overall, we paid $180 incl of GST and service charge for our entire meal for 3 people (1 appetizer, 4 mains and a half bottle of wine) - the meal, service and ambience was outstanding and the value is definitely there if you order wisely. We will definitely be continuing our tradition of visiting Blu Kouzina frequently
3
We went a few times before they moved here. This was our first visit at Dempsey Hill (been since for lunch again). We sat at the back terrace which we did not like. The service was reasonably good. The food was very much like before, so it has remained consistent. Personally I feel the menu is very limited, there is a lot of very good Greek cuisine that is not represented, but "Greece" is a big country, not all of it contiguous. What there is on the menu is good, and it is definitely the best place to get greek food in Singapore.
3
We went twice to This restaurant recently... And found the service to be good and attentive both times....ambience of the place is nice as well. ...on the food front though, I have eaten better food than here. Some dishes are good, but overall the taste is still average. Portions are small for the Price and thus seems overpriced for the quantity and taste.
4
First things first, the food is excellent. The souvlaki was excellent, tender and tasty, and I'd order it again in a heartbeat. The service was friendly and enthusiastic, but very hectic and at times misguided - our main course was brought to the table 30 seconds after our starters arrived. Our table wasn't even big enough for all the dishes they were trying to give us! The place was booked out, and the punters are certainly coming to eat the food - but the service needs sorting out if this is going to become a reliable five star experience.
3
Blue kozina is my absolute favorite restaurant in Singapore, or used to be!!! I loved the old blue kozina!!! The new location is too noisy, too big, too impersonal. Not my favorite place anymore.
Food continues to be great!!!
5
Great Resturant and very friendly and competent staffs. Great food and great value. Great varieties of food. will revisit.
5
Bku Kouzina was amazing! Right up the with one of the best, if not the best, Greek food we've had outside of Greece. The menu had a wide variety of options. Serving size was generous. Staff were extremely attentive, and service was prompt and efficient. A short taxi ride took us to this area (about $15 each way from the CBD). This war not the cheapest place to eat but it was worth every dollar
2
We had dined here before they moved to this location and was appalled by the service. Here are some of the long list of things that were disappointing considering the prices of this place...1. We were simply pointed to our table from a few tables away2. Red wine was served ice cold! And the wine was terrible...3. Chairs were back to back with another table and the waiter elbowed my partner on his head while carrying a tray of food4. We were left with holding the side plates when our mains arrived as there was no space on the table.. And the waiter simply walked away5. Cleared our wine and water glasses when we were still not done drinking 6. No apology when we commented on the service at the endThe list goes on with other details that should have been noted at such an establishment. And the food was average for the price
5
We lived round the corner from this place and it was a big favorite for us. That is saying something given the thousands of eating options in Singapore. Really good fresh ingredients - great salads and fish and wonderful wines to match. Perfect for a romantic dinner for two or a boisterous gathering with friends and family. Lovely service and friendly staff complete the experience. We don't live in Singapore anymore but we do miss the old neighborhood Greek
4
Very good food... Mixed meat platter for 2 fed 4, the starters are all great I highly recommend the smashed eggplant and the fish roe yogurt. I also suggest you stay well clear of the house red wine. Not a connoisseur by any measure but it's possibly the worst wine I've ever had in my life. Good service and good food. Good stop in Dempsey.
4
My search for an authentic Greek restaurant came to a happy ending yesterday when my party of 4 dined at Blu Kouzina. Although a bit pricey, we had a stellar time enjoying a wide variety of dishes. Standout dishes include the smoked eggplant, vine leaves stuffed with rice and the grilled lamb chops (perfection). The best dish for us was the grilled Octopus. One grouse we had however with Blu Kozina is the seating arrangement. The tables are tad high and the chairs are not exactly the most accommodating. We would have loved to stay for dessert but honestly there are far better options for this at Dempsey Village, and of course far more comfortable seating. That said, we have unanimously ranked Blu Kouzina as perhaps the best Greek fare outside of Mykonos or Melbourne
5
I had just found this place and started to frequent it on a regular basis when they up and moved to Dempsey Hill. I was so sad I almost cried. Portions are pretty big here - especially for Singapore. I always got some spanakopita, pita, sometimes some chicken (they had wraps for lunch) and once I ordered the galaktoboureko. Ok, 2 or 3 times. Even my kids got addicted. It's not a dessert you can get everywhere and it's yummy. I am hoping to invite some friends when summer break is over. I want to try their Greek red wine, mavrodaphne. Not sure about hours in the new place but at their old location they were only open for lunch like Fri-Sun, which was a bummer because I like lunch. The owners are truly generous people, in the spirit of true Greek hospitality. I never left hungry and always felt welcome - even walking in alone off the street, drenched in sweat. I'm so sad they've moved so far away - and so hungry now
5
We had heard many good things about this restaurant and having a Greek husband who misses his Greek dishes, we gave it a try. There are only around 3 Greek restaurants in Singapore and I understand this is the best. The owner (s) is Greek himself.The restaurant has recently moved to Dempsey which can be a bit out of the way for those used to taking the MRT but the setting is lovely. Tastefully decorated, comfortable sofas to sit, clean bathroom and authentic Greek decoration. The service was superb; I think the food arrived before we had finished ordering and the staff were wonderful and very attentive. What to say about the food? Delicious and spot on considering the distance from Greece and not being able to get authentic Greek food like tomatoes and Greek bread, for example. My husband who knows his Greek dishes very well having ran a very successful restaurant in his early 20's couldn't praise the food highly enough. Enough lemon, olive oil and garlic to make it perfect!I don't think you could go wrong with any of the dishes on the menu. Overall, this is a fantastic restaurant. Book well before to avoid disappointment and my advice would be to sit outside ( full aircon) as it is much quieter than the main building. I just wish this restaurant was open for lunch
5
Quite simply, the best Greek food I've eaten( in Greece of elsewhere). We went with our friends in Singapore who were hosting us, and it was a memorable evening. We left the ordering to our experienced hosts, and quite sensibly, they ordered wonderfully. A constant procession of 'Mezedes'( small plates of appetisers) & Salads came our way. If you want recommendations, go for Bougiourdi( red peppers stuffed with feta cheese), Feta Psiti( grilled feta cheese), Dolmades Gialiatzi( vine leaves stuffed with rice), Spanakopita( phylo pastry stuffed with spinach, feta &herbs), Fasolosalata( 3-bean salad). Don't miss the great Greek wine that goes well with this meal. For dessert, the Baklava is as good as any other place, but the real winner for me was the Bougatsa( filo pastry with semolina cream filling
5
I can't stop raving about this place. All round winner. Fairly expensive but my nr 1 in Singapore. Food platters amazing and get a salad and a few sides all pleased. Well done guys.
2
We were seated in the outdoor section even though we booked weeks ahead. The poor ventilation and heat ruined the evening.
5
Stunning Greek food, be careful not to over order the servings are generous especially on the platters.have been many times. New location in Demsey.
5
It's my second time to the restaurant and it was very busy even though it was Wednesday evening. We sat indoor and the table was huge so it was rather difficult to share food as it was rather noisy. However, overall very positive experience.
5
The dempsey restaurant is beautifully and cosily furnished. Service is friendly and food is amazing. The grilled octopus and sardines are highly recommended!
5
We head pretty late and no reservation made but service staff was nice enough too check with the kitchen and allow us to dine in.
Food arrive fast and never fail in taste. Always a great experience dining at Blu Kouzina.

Visited after my brother recommended the place. Dempsey can be out of the way unless you drive or take a cab. I had used the chope app to make an online reservation. However, I forgot to request for seats in the air-conditioned portion of the restaurant and hence we were allocated "outdoor" seats. Might have been a blessing in disguise though. The Air-conditioned portion is part of an open kitchen concept. Kitchen smells though aromatic, were strong and our clothes might have smelled if we had sat there.The outdoor portion was adequately equipped with fans and coolers. This is particularly important to us since Singapore can get really hot and humid. Ambience was cozy and relaxing. However as seats are pretty close (kind of cramped actually), you probably can overhear a nearby table's conversation.As the place was packed, service was hurried. But they were never rude. Just occupied and I can't really blame them given the crowd.Ordered a meat platter, seafood platter, the cod fish dip and pita bread to share among 4 hungry girls. We found the meat platter a little on the salty side while the side of fries could do with more salt. That said, the lamb chops were among the best I've ever had. As for the seafood platter, the jumbo prawns were a tad overcooked but the squid very well-done. Unfortunately, they did not have any fish in stock that night. A pity since my brother had recommended the sea bream.The highlight of the meal though was the humble cod fish dip. Absolutely delicious with the slightest hint of fish. We scrapped the plate completely clean. This is a MUST order.Food is good but not great. Will come back if I have a craving for some Greek cuisine and a car

Delicious food & great service! 11 of us had lunch on Sunday, which I booked after hearing great reviews of Blu Kouzina from friends. We were not disappointed!! The service was timely & our waiter was extremely helpful at advising us on ordering appropriately to cater for all our needs. We ordered the meat platter for 4, plus fish/squid, salads & a few starters. All the dishes we received were cooked well & were delicious. I would thoroughly recommend a meal here! Great for families, couples or friends with a buzzy & friendly atmosphere. Thank you

I do enjoy Greek food and this is definitely my 'go to'.The meat platter is huge, and the meat is tender. Moussaka is great. Baklava is a must! I definitely have a habit of over ordering here, but the staff are always helpful and give good guidance if you ask. We sat outside, and I was in shirt and trousers (straight from the office). It was ok since they had good fan coverage. I recommend you book in advance if you plan to go on the weekends. Weekdays we had no problem finding a table for 3-4 people

Blu Kouzina used to be located at Bukit Timah and recently moved to Dempsey. The new place is much more spacious with high ceilings and keeps with the bright, airy feeling that I've known Blu Kouzina to be. I'm glad that the food is still just as great as I remember it to be especially the three dip platter (that isn't actually on their menu).

Great spot for lunch. Food is fresh and delicious. A little noisy but I guess that's what happens when you put a load of women into a room. Definitely go back.

But preferred old venue which had better atmosphere with more greek feel to it .new venue more minimalist .food always excellent .
5
Excellent food, second time we have been, great service and flexible friendly staff.
Super fresh sea food and everything tastes and cooked to perfection.
Well done

Ordered the seafood platter and mousaka for the two of us, very tasty and fresh ingredients were used. Sat outdoor where the ambience was very Mediterranean, cosy.

This is our first time visiting Blu Kouzina after they moved to their new location at Dempsey.We came here for dinner on a Friday evening and the restaurant was very packed; almost all the tables were occupied. Using a tablet which showed empty tables, the waiter brought us to our table at the last room, which was not air-conditioned. As the waiters were busy serving other guests and clearing tables, we had to notify one of the waiter to bring us the menu. We ordered the lentils for starter along with pita bread; they went along well with each other. For the mains, we had the Meat Platter for 2 consisting of 2 beef patties, 2 beef balls, 4 lamb cuts and 2 beef cuts. The meat was very fresh and tender but the beef patties were a little too salty. After the heavy meal, the waiter gave us complimentary digestifs, which made us feel a little better. That was very nice of him as we were feeling a little bloated after the meal

This is a popular joint for greek food. High ceilings, blue-white colour combination give an authentic feel to it.We ordered a Spanakopita (Filo pastry with Spinach filling) and Tzatziki/Pita for appetisers and Kotopoulo Fourno (roasted baby chicken with potato and olive oil) for mains. Can't fault the food, its delicious! We will come back for more.The seating however could be better. They have put in a lot of seats and so the place feels a bit cramped. You can overhear other guests. The tables too are small for my liking. Plus, no proper waiting area outside. The owner has clearly tried to optimise for number of guests he can accommodate
5
I have been there several times and they have never disappointed me. As a guy coming from Mediterranean region, I can easily say that their food is amazing. It may be a little bit salty from time to time but it is quite acceptable. They are always welcoming and very polite. Their new location in Dempsey is much better than the previous one.I strongly recommend this restaurant to all Greek, Turkish and other Mediterranean kitchen lovers..

I love this place and have been coming to the old Bukit Tima joint for years until the place became overly popular despite those mean people who stopped them having the wonderful outside dining which abruptly came to halt a couple of years ago. The new location is excellent with a huge conservatory structure in the back which makes for a very Mediterranean experience. The smell of the grilled lamb as soon as one parks one's car is alluring. The only negative was the very mean serving of Greek bubbly which was effectively a half filled glass for 16 bucks. They filled it up when I pointed it out however. Highly recommended!

Wonderful authentic Greek food - full bodied olive oil, fresh produce and great Mediterranean flavours. Large airy and noisy restaurant but it fits in with the casual relaxed Greek way. It brought back wonderful memories of our time in Chania, Crete and Athens. The Greek salad Horiatiki, pita bread and eggplant hummus and the tzatziki were amazing! King prawn, lamb chops and sardines were just great. We had a delightful Greek white wine which complemented the meal well. Desserts are delectable - the filo pastry filled with custard in a little spring roll was heavenly but let it cool a while before you bite into it. Service was well coordinated and superb - Thanks to Christos, Manager par excellence! It was a delightful Sunday lunch and we are planning our next meal there already!

Buzzing restaurant in a popular foodie hotspot on Dempsey. But Blu stands out for two reasons…. firstly it’s very difficult to get a table unless you book in advance and the price tag which comes in just shy of $90pp without alcohol. So this is more of a “planned treat dinner” rather than a “stop by for dinner” kind of place. Nevertheless it is still packed every night of the week!The restaurant is large with two bright and airy dining rooms. There is also some space to dine al fresco if you wish to challenge the Singapore heat! Front of house staff is a family affair with the several members of the family running the show which is always nice to see. So what is cooking:The menu is a wide selection of Greek Mezzas and main courses too which includes imported fish from Greece. The quality of the ingredients and care in the cooking is easily detectable throughout. We were hungry so we ordered a lot of food and I have included photos of everything. - Greek salad – the classic with olives and a generous slab of Feta (we got two!) - Cooked cheese with fig sauce – interesting combination so worth a try once- Meza dips with stuffed pita breads were delightful, each Mezza – lentils, aubergine and yoghurt were beautiful and served with lovely fresh warm pitta- The mixed meat grill for two persons was the highlight of the evening, wow, generous hunks of imported meat grilled to perfection and presented beautifully – the platter contains two minced meat burgers with Greek seasoning, several meatballs, two skewers of lamb cubes and 4 excellent lamb chops which were the best part for sure. Accompanied by chips and delicious Tzatziki - Additionally we ordered a wrap with salad and meatballs which was probably the poshest kebab roll I have ever seen in my life. Few bottles of san pellegrino later and it was time to leave but the excellent staff did not rush us and in fact gave us some lovely baklava to end on a sweet note. Overall verdict on Blu = well its packed every night for a reason! love it, no sign of blandness in any dish from start to finish – everything here packed a good punch! would defi recommend to friends and family

One of our favorite restaurants as a couple or even with a group of friends. Good food, drinks and service!
5
The food at Blu kouzina consistently impresses and delights your taste buds. The service is prompt and very warm. By far one of my all time favourite restaurants in the city. Love it!
4
Imagine a fully booked restaurant with no airconditioning. We ordered meat platter, which was delicious. But the personell was too buzy to properly serve us and the heat was unbearable.
5
Each dish that was presented to us was mouthwatering to look at and tasted even better. The dishes were simple, fresh and honest flavors. The service was faultless, it felt like an out of Singapore experience with the ambiance and authentic greek flavors. We walked in on a Saturday afternoon for lunch and by the time we finished we asked if they had any free table for dinner. Unfortunately they were already fully booked and I can fully understand why. Im already looking forward to a second visit there
4
I have been there many times with my family and the food is always good. The service is good and they do not recommend you to order a lot.Usually a platter with 2 mains is more than enough for a party of 4. It is a child friendly place. Parking can be a little challenging depending on the timing.

We hadn't been to Blu Kuz for a couple of years, and heard that it moved from Bukit Timah to Dempsey, so we decided to have my birthday dinner there. It was always one of our favorite restaurants in Singapore, with its authentic and delicious Greek food and wine and very friendly owners and staff.In its new place in Dempsey, it seems like they have more room, all on one floor, unlike previously where diners had to go up to the 2nd or 3rd floors of a converted house. The menu was basically similar, and we decided to go simple - the Horiatiki (classic Greek salad) and the Souvlaki me Pita (a large beef kalamaki wrapped in pita with tomatoes, onions, tatziki sauce and paprika), which we split. We had a very smooth red wine (Greek cabernet-merlot) to go with the meal.The same hosts were there, and came over to chat and to make sure things were taken care of properly. They were so friendly, they even gave us a complementary platter of mixed Greek desserts, which was the perfect ending of wonderful meal.It will remain among my top Singapore restaurants
5
As the title says, this is my favourite restaurant in Singapore. I have visited the restaurant multiple times when it used to be at Bukit Timah, but haven't visited since it moved to Dempsey. But I am sure it would be as good as earlier if not better. Despite being on the banks of a big road at Bukit Timah, the restaurant ambience was phenomenal. The Inside have the relaxing feel of being on a Greek vacation, even sitting outside was nice. The hosts are super-nice- they would help you through the menu and the wine list if you are struggling with it, and they also give some great recommendations. Do look out for the menu of the day, which generally is very good. starting the meal with a bowl of Lentil Soup would be a great idea. Their whole menu is worth trying. Feta Saganaki, Mousaka, Bougiourdi, Smoked Eggplants, Grilled fish have been some of my most admired choices from the menu. My friend who often accompanies me to the restaurant and who also considers this as his favourite restaurant in Singapore, also likes their beef patties. Their Baklava is also very good quality- not too sweet, just right. At times, they have offered complementary pieces of Baklava after a meal when one doesn't have enough space left to have a full dessert. Not to forget pairing the food with some of their finest wines. I can go on writing about the place and still my review won't do full justice to them. So, better try it yourself

After my first visit to their Bukit Timah outlet a couple of years ago, I'd been wanting to go back. Happy to report that the food is still spectacular. 3 of us girls ordered a meat platter for 2, spanikopita and grilled octopus. The octopus was perfection. The huge meat platter was meat-sweat inducing - everything perfectly seasoned and in generous portions. Looking forward to returning
5
I really enjoyed this place from the moment they dealt very nicely with changing our reservation over the phone. Great patience;) Then the meal itself, "simple" Greek food cooked to perfection, the service and the lovely Greek wine recommended by our waiter. We tried grilled octopus, spanakopita, and a kebab dish (I don't remember the original name of the dish) with fries. The "kebab" meat was lovely medium rare grilled lamb fillet, so no comparison to the street food. A find in Singapore as there aren't many restaurants serving other Mediterranean dishes than pasta and pizza.
5
We came on Monday night and the place was buzzing full house. The decor, as the previous place, is predominantly blue, rustic, homey, beautiful.The service was amazing. Our server was efficient and experienced, his confident shows. He answered all our queries and gave us recommendation confidently, tweaked some of our order to suit us (we were two and we ordered too many plates so he made half portion for the meat platter: TOP). Food as always are delicious. Grilled octopus was my favorite, sardine was fresh and generous portion. Meat and lamb rack cooked to perfection. Olive oil was delicious, fresh with almost spicy after-taste. While they are not cheap you can feel that produces used are of high quality cooked perfectly and portions are very generous. Wine is affordable. Service and ambience are warm. What more could you ask for? Really one of the best restaurant in Singapore
5
We had a fabulous meal here. The menu is extensive and the quality first class. Also a great ambiance inside or outdoor.
5
The food was excellent and the homemade deserts were out of this world - this is coming from a Greek.
5
The setting is rustic and relaxed. Service is great and food delicious and authentic. Entrees and mains can all be shared. Tons of vegetarian options ...

First time at the new location in Dempsey - plus is that the food and atmosphere is still as good as it was, but there's plenty of parking now too! We were sat in the back area which is essentially a conservatory and were too hot (this was evening) so next time I would reserve a table in the main room which has air con

We have often eaten at BT Timah and were very excited to be having my birthday at Blu Kouzina - Dempsey. last night. We booked a table for 10 of us. The restaurant has been fitted out well On arrival we were put in the tent at the back of the restaurant which is not AC - only fans- not great for those straight from work. As it was busy, over time everyone was very hot! This kinda spoiled the event for me and given the price of the meal I think you need to tell people when they book about the lack of AC as the old place had AC and you would expect the same environment. Service was slower than normal but then the place is full so again a teething problem I reckon. We got moved afterwards for the cake inside to AC however the meal was a hot affair. The food is as always amazing!! Hoping this teething problem around AC is solved soon before I would return. Food excellent, environment average hence a generous very good overall. If you are booking ask for AC or don't come in business suits!

The experience started from just outside the restaurant - the aroma of grilled meat, seafood, herbs wafted across the car park...it just smelled right!The great vibes continued at reception - a genuinely warm & friendly welcomeAs I was taken to my table, I came across 3 or 4 members of the waitstaff and management - all of whom greeted me warmly (please note, this was my first meal here)When I noticed that the sea bass and bream were listed on the menu as being imported from Greece, I asked whether I could have a look at the fish - not only did my waiter immediately welcome my request and take me to the kitchen, but when we reached the kitchen and the team were informed of my request, they told me that they would be very happy to bring the fish to my table whilst I had a drink and let me view the fish at my convenience - the vibes were getting better and better!needless to say, the fish looked stunning, and I had no hesitation in ordering a 1kg sea bass and a 400g sea bream for my party of 3The next "hit" was when I tasted the olive oil in which I'd dipped a piece of bread - the grassy, peppery flavour was almost - fortunately, not quite - overwhelming My meal was almost ruined as I couldn't help slathering the bread with heaps of the EVOO - we eventually purchase 20 litres to take back with us!!The food was fabulous: huge portions of salad, grilled vegetables, charred eggplant dip..topped by the grilled fish, which was absolutely perfectly grilledI have never had grilled fish as delicious as this in Asia, and overall, it was the best grilled fish I've had since the grilled turbot at a quayside restaurant in IstanbulThe owner(s)/management, once they realised how passionate we were about the food, showered us with complimentary herbs and tea to take home, and spent a significant amount of time chatting with usThis really is an extraordinary restaurant, with a genuinely passionate team ensuring the slick operation of the busines

We have eaten at Blu Kouzina for many years in their old location in Bukit Timah Rd and has become a firm family favourite. We approached the move to the new location with some anxiety and hoped that wonderful recipe had not be altered. We shouldn't have worried, the new place is far more spacious, great parking and the food is as excellent as ever. What really differentiates Blu Kouzina from the majority of eating establishments in Singapore is the universally good quality of the food and ingredients, these are just on another (much higher) level entirely. Their mezze is great and the the chicken, fish and meat on offer wonderfully fresh and delicious. Their use of the finest greek oil, olives, herbs, salt and an extensive selection of greek wine, spirits and beer (many available for sale) just adds another layer to the experience. If you like greek food (or mediterranean), you'll love Blu Kouzina

Amazing food, wonderful ambiance and some of the best service we have experienced in SingaporeWe have heard so many rave reviews from friends about Blu Kouzina and so thought we'd be missing out if we didn't go visit.We received a phone call that afternoon confirming the reservation, but also informing us that they had moved from their old location on Bukit Timah to Dempsey Hill. Upon arrival and walking inside, it feels like you've been transferred thousands of miles away to an authentic Greek Taverna. We were originally sat inside near the kitchen, but found it to be a bit too cold with the aircon, and asked to be moved. Without hesitation, we were moved to the back room which not only was of a far more pleasant temperature, but more lively as well.Great service (a rarity in Singapore) and the food was absolutely fantastic. We had the eggplant starter, along with the feta stuffed red pepper followed by the meat platter which came with various types of meat, chips and tzatziki for 2 and all was truly delicious. We were preparing to roll out of the restaurant having eaten so much food, for some complimentary deserts to arrive at our table - bonus!Definitely going back again soon
4
We decided to have a casual lunch date, and haven't had Greek food in quite a while. Blu kouzina did not disappoint! The olive oil was amazing, great starters, octopus was fantastic, mixed grill pretty good, and desserts wonderful. It's a little on the pricey side considering how cramped and noisy the restaurant gets, but otherwise a great experience
5
Have visited blu Kouzina many times and it is hands down the best Greek food you can get outside of Greece! The staff are lovely and knowledgeable and always greet you with a smile. The Greek salad is amazing -a huge block of feta! The mains are great for sharing and the complimentary shot at the end of the meal ensures you leave happy!
4
The best agreed meal I've eaten. Very relaxed atmosphere and clearly popular. The octopus was incredible - we ordered an extra serving for all it was so good!
Solely Greek wines - all were good especially the Chardonnay as recommended by the wine waiter
5
Fantastic atmosphere, setting, service and most importantly FOOD. I would highly recommend to anyone.
4
Visited the restaurant for my birthday celebration. Was pleasantly surprised by the excellent service, fr the valet parking service to the wait staff. Must try: the grilled eggplant dip and beef patties.
5
They surprised us with complimentary wine and dessert to wish us happy anniversary. The food was as fabulous as we had in Greece
Will be back for more!
5
You HAVE to come and see what BLU has done with their new home at Dempsey.....It is absolutely amazing! A little bit of the Greek Islands in the middle of Tanglin, the new premises are spectacular and food quality just as good if not better! There is a little al fresco enclave in the back of the restaurant which reminds me of Mykonos! Food is very good, the lamb perfect as always and the Greek wine very good quality, all at a very good price! Enjoy!!
5
The only improvement pt Blu Kouzina had was space and after moving to Dempsey, space and ambiance is now there biggest asset; stunning greek atmosphere with classic greek architecture and handpicked decor pieces add to the whole theme.Everything food, service, ambiance, music is just perfect!!
5
I'm not saying only because I come from the Mediterranean and their food suits my taste perfectly, but they really serve amazing quality food at Blu Kouzina. They just moved from Bukit Timah to Dempsey and it's a shame their TripAdvisor rating has to start from scratch! I think it was in the Top 3 restaurants in Singapore earlier.I think everything on the menu is worth to try; meat platter, greek salad and all of the appetizers are to die for. It is not cheap but it's what you would expect to pay for the quality of the food, ambience and service altogether. Make sure you accompany your food with Greek Ouzo or Wine. Plenty of options for vegeterians as well but I cannot think of coming here and not having red meat or grilled fish and the kalamari (squid)
4
We went to the old venue a few times before the big move and it was one of our favourite restaurants in Singapore - excellent Greek food with great service. The restaurant moved around 10 days ago to Dempsey and the initial impression is that the move was the right one to make - double the seating size, much more spread out and airy than before (the key criticism of the old place) and more central. We were three couples and hit all the old favourites plus some of the specials - happy to report that the food is as good as ever, taramasalata to die for, insanely tender Octopus, lovely fresh Greek salad - no complaints. They've obviously had to increase staff numbers for the new size of venue and this would be the only complaint, the operation isn't quite as slick as it used to be, but be fair, it's only just opened - we'll be back, too yummy not to go!!
5
This place has some of the most amazing Greek food i've tasted anywhere in the world. Including Greece! The owners are passionate about bringing the freshest, best quality produce and alot of it actually comes direct from Greece. The staff are excellent, food is amazing, ambience is fantastic. Great for special occasion dinners and even lively business meetings. Five stars

Blu Kouzina has moved to (Block 10) #01-21, 10 Dempsey Rd, Singapore 247700. T:+65 6875 0872. You may want to update this. It is authentic Greek food - the beans salad, aubergine dish, spinach pastry, meat platter and octopus were fantastic. The sardines were not as inspiring.Our seating was tight. We had to struggle out of our bench seats at the far end. Service friendly and as prompt as can be on a Sunday full house. All good
5
Never been disappointed here. The best taramasalata and greek salad anywhere! Transport yourself to the Med!!
5
Fresh and tasty. Had the Greek salad, appetizer trio with pita bread and grilled lamb. Lamb was exceptional! Greek wine was superb!
4
A very cozy restaurant with a very friendly staff. Had several options to choose for vegetarians, which is good. Very reasonable price. was very busy on a weekday evening. if you are looking for a different style of cuisine try this one.
5
It is now the 4th time we went to Blu for dinner and the food was again exceptional and so fresh and authentic. Always live their Greek salad with their own olive oil , fresh and tasty tomatoes and cucumbers abs feta cheese. The fish platter for two is good for four people and we added one single potion of the beef platter. This was so delicious. The only disappointment was my table allocation, I had reserved a table outside as I feel that gives the most authentic feeling, but unfortunately we got a table upstairs, which Isn't so cozy and way to loud for any conversation. But despite that I will come back
5
We went there on our first night in Singapore and had a blast. The food was delicious form start to finish, the service was kind and attentive, both owners and servers were just amazing. We will definitely be back the first chance we get. It was an authentic Greek experience at its very best.
5
It felt like Santorini! I visited Greece in 2014 and had so much fond memories of the cuisine there. I had not tried Greek cuisine since then.....because I believe that it would never be the same. I was wrong! Bu Kouzina really made a great effort to do up the restaurant deco, mimicking the Santorini atmosphere....minus the sky and sea.....The food was fantastic. I was transported to Greece almost immediately. Excellent service too.
3
It was my family's 2nd visit. This time, the phylo pastry with feta cheese and spinach filling was baked too long. The pastry was dark brown and the corners were burnt. This dish tasted heavenly at our first visit but tasted quite sad this time. The grilled octopus also came with burnt bits. We also loved it much more the first time we tried it, without the overcooked parts. However, the lamb chop was excellent.
5
My husband and I celebrated his birthday here. The restaurant was busy, busy but the staff was still attentive- they know the menu very well! The food was delicious. The pita is a must get, and the smoked eggplant dip was awesome- definitely large enough for 3/4 to share as an appetizer. I would suggest getting a reservation to sit upstairs in the AC. Great food
4
We were there on a Monday night and it was running full house.The service is excellent. The managers and chef personally greeted us and gave recommendation on the freshest food for the dayWe had grilled lamb chops and grilled sea bream which the chef personally cooked for us. The lamb was tender and the fish very fresh. Try the pita bread too. Its nicely grilled. We did not particularly like the lentil soup. Perhaps the restaurant should provide a choice of soup instead of serving only the soup of the dayWhat we enjoyed most was the dessert. Baklava served with Greek yoghurt , fresh apples with generous sprinkle of cinnamon and hone
5
We like this restaurant so much that this was our third visit in two months. The food is excellent and the portions are generous. This restaurant is good for couples but even better with a larger group as you can then get to try a lot more items on the menu. Food - Everything we've eaten here have been delicious. I particularly enjoyed their Imam Baildi (grilled egg plant with tomatoes), Taramosalata (white row dip), Horiatiki salad and grilled whole fish (which is one of the more expensive item on the menu but is good for sharing). They've also thrown in free dessert every time we've been there, which is a nice touch. Our friend whose mother is Greek says that this place is his favorite in Singapore and wants to bring his mum to the restaurant when she next visits as he thinks that this would pass her very high standards. Wine - We usually ask the owners/ staff to recommend the wine as we are unfamiliar with Greek wine regions and varietals and have so far really enjoyed their recommendations - both white and red. Ambiance - the ground floor is open air, close to the kitchen and rather crowded. The second floor is the most charming but the third floor is pretty nice as well and where the larger groups typically get seated. The owners told us that they are moving to Dempsey soon and are converting this restaurant to a tapas styled restaurant. We wish them all the best and can't wait to check their new concepts out.
4
Its a beautiful little greek restaurant, which serves amazingly authentic food. Portions are huge and it can get quite crowded so reservations are recommended.
5
Very tasty and authentic Greek food. Generous plates and very good olive oil from the family farm in Greece. Worth the travel.
5
and great service! It was a bit far from our place but so worth it. Will definitely be coming back many times.
5
Blu Kouzina is a fantastic Greek restaurant -- we used to go more often when we lived nearby, but now its a bit of a trek so we only make it once or twice a year. Great food, and friendly service. Definitely recommend.

This is the second time my grassroots committee chose this restaurant as our work retreat venue. I was overseas last year and yesterday was my first time presence at this restaurant. Initially, I was wondering why my committee chairman chose this restaurant again. After last night's retreat, I am sure my chairman had made the right decision much to my delight. Firstly, the manager was efficient and understand our needs well. He allowed us to use the restaurant room for our meeting early with no interference from 2 to 5 pm. We were able to talk to our heartiest volume with minimum disturbance to his guests as they only came in for dinner after 6 pm. It was a very customer oriented flexible arrangement and we are grateful for his little thoughtfulness for us.Secondly, the restaurant is very well-furnished and well decorated. I felt extremely relaxed with the navy blue color, the miniature lighthouse dÃ©cor, the Mediterranean setting and the beautiful rosy flowers near the window. The sumptuous dinner would not have been so fulfilling without this comfortable, air-conditioned and relaxed background setting. Thirdly. The food was fantastically and gorgeously cooked. This is the first time I had a taste of Greek food but the lovely food gave me so deep an impression that my taste bud would not forget. I understand that in Singapore, there are only 2 or 3 restaurants serving Greek cuisine. But Blu Kouzina cuisine is exception. Although I did not have the luxury to compare, the mutton steak was so tender and the fish so fresh that you knew this restaurant cuisine was so unique and superior in this area. My vegetarian colleague enjoyed the plate of mixed mushroom and vegetable in cheese and I personally like the freshly and meaty barbequed squid. Fourthly, I am impressed by the efficient and courteous service of the waiters. They strike conversations with us and attended to our needs promptly. Courteous and full of smiles, I felt they should be well commended. Last but not least, we could pay our bill in cheque much to our surprise and convenience. Well assured that we would hold our next retreat at the same venue
4
We celebrated our son's birthday. As it was our first visit, we left the ordering to the manager. The food which he recommended were all good. We loved every single dish that was served. For appetisers, we had the smoked eggplant with herbs, yoghurt dip and pita bread. Main course was the meat platter, grilled octopus & sea bass. The waiters were friendly and the service pleasant. Although the food was a bit pricey, will recommend this restaurant if you want a different dining experience
5
Pick this place for a business dinner. They provide free valet service, nice decoration with blue and white theme just liked Santorini! As a frequent travelers to Greece, the food here are comparable.What I was impressed was the waiter's recommendation as he is right that the meat plater for 2 is actually too much for the 2 of us! You feel the Greek's friendliness the moment you step into this place! Yes,chef was from Santorini!
4
We celebrated my niece's birthday at this restaurant. We enjoyed the food. For appetisers, i recommend the fried cheese with figs and grilled octopus which were delicious. We also had the eggplant caviar, yoghurt dip, Greek salad and pita bread. We had the meat platter and grilled sea bass for our main course. The fish was excellent! The meat was also nice esp the lamb chop but we were too full to really enjoy it. We had a free dessert . fresh apples with cinnamon, and some filo pastry desserts. The one with honey and nuts taste and look similar to the Middle Eastern desserts. Service at the restaurant was good. The waiters were attentive even though they were running full. I will definitely return
5
Lovely blue and white decor that reminds one of the Greek taverns. Helmed by friendly and attentive staff who will let you know if they feel that you've ordered too much. Prices are reasonable for the quality and portion size. Every visit there has been most satisfying
5
This restaurant came highly recommended by our hotel concierge and by Trip Advisor. We enjoyed a wonderful meal of Greek salad (with a huge tasty slab of feta), Spanakopita (very fresh and hot) and Beef Souvlaki, medium rare and excellently prepared. Staff was friendly and attentive. We were even given free dessert samples! Easy cab ride from the Orchard Road area
1
Really disappointed when we ordered
Meat quality very bad.only fava my favorite.we didn't order wine when we saw prices.
5
Amazing authentic Greek food and great service from friendly and attentive staff. Grilled meat platter is a must but as advised by servers, only order platter for 2 pax between 4! Plenty to go round, and don't forget to order their amazing tzaziki
5
Cool little place with nice deco greece style. If only the sea is really beside..octopus is very chewy, not hard to bite at all. Lamb chops are soft and savory. Definitely will be back for more like fish prawns etc.

For years I have passed this place on my commute and read reviews and was meaning to go so many times. Finally we made it!it was worth the wait.OMG the food, YUM. We had so much ! it just kept coming ! Dips, Saganaki, greek salad, souvlaki, dolmades, and on and on...I fancy myself a bit of an expert on Greek cuisine for many reasons. (Dating Greeks, best friends with Greeks, lived near the Danforth in Toronto for years) I am sure this is no doubt the ONLY Greek resto you need to visit in Singapore. The staff are GREEK! I love it ! I felt so right at home. They were so friendly and accommodating! Efharisto' Christos

I grew up in North London eating Greek food so it was nice to see a Greek restaurant in Singapore. I like the idea of a restaurant being outside the city centre - it somehow therefore seems to attract a family type clientele rather than businessmen or tourists.The service was quite friendly in this restaurant that always seems to be busy. It's not cheap but the food is decent. I particularly enjoyed the squid. A simple dish but not that easy to get right. I actually thought the kebabs were a little disappointing and the fish is pricy but it's probably worth getting the large platter if you have a large group that's hungry
5
Found the restaurant from Trip Advisor and was really pleased with the quality of the food. We ordered appetisers such as tzatziki, pita bread, Greek salad and grilled paprika with feta and they were all good quality . Main dishes Souvlaki, lamb chop and pita wrap were up to greek standard. However, dont expect paying Greek prices but English/Swedish prices. Easy to find if you come by taxi as the restaurant is on the main road.
5
I was not much interested to try Greek food until my husband planned a date night in this restaurant. And i am super impressed, loved to the next level. The service was impressive and husband did mention that it was not easy to get reservation here. So, plan ahead and it is totally worth it
1
I came here for dinner just because of all the good reviews from Tripadvisor. I was extremely disappointed!! The place has very uncomfortable tables and chairs, is very noisy and there is no ambiance at all, I felt like I was in a crowded kopitiam!! The food also is very very expensive and the meet was overcooked and dry/hard. The wine also was overpriced, you can find the same bottles and $20-30 less in other restaurants. Never go back
4
Highly recommended and the food is very, very good. Their Greek salad is the best I've ever had and is big enough for 2 to share. The lamb chops were tender and juicy and the souvlaki was lovely too. The burger patties were tasty and not dried out at all. It is not cheap but well worth the price for the atmosphere and great food.
5
Feels like you can try anything here and it will be delicious...The owner or manager is on top of things, the open kitchen looks clean and organized.The food was seriously delicious.We had a starter with fried cheese and fig, tasty.The Octopus was tender and had a balanced flavor. We'll come back for that for sure. Moussaka tasty, nicest one I had. For the dessert we got some small pastry.This place checked all the boxes. Congratulations to the team
5
Food is always excellant, servers always pay attention and their recommendations are always good too.
5
Service is impeccable, atmosphere is great - really chill for a group of friends/family. Go in bigger groups to try out more food!!
5
Impeccable service; staffs were very attentive and courteous. Owner was around to recommend dishes and chit chat with us. Good ambience - one would feel you are at Greece ! Food are delicious and the portion is huge!
2
Food is average and the restaurant is too hard to get into. Waiters and hostess are a bit too aggressive and cocky. Go to Artichoke instead!
3
I went to there to celebrate my birthday. Ordered Greek salad, Souvlaki and musaka. Souvlaki was great, musaka is average. It might be my personal preference but I didn't like cheese put on salad...
Owner was very nice !
5
You step into Blu and the atmosphere immediately creates an instant feeling that you are in a home run restaurant in Greece. The staff are very accommodating and make you feel welcome. The menu offers a wide variety of traditional dishes and everything tastes fantastic. The feta cheese and olive oil alone is a taste you cannot duplicate anywhere else in Singapore! You depart feeling very satisfied and wonder when you will next return!
5
What can I say? I love going back to Blu Kouzina. The ambience, furnishing and decor are tasteful and elegant yet casual. The service is consistently outstanding. Staff is attentive, knowledgeable about everything on the menu and Greek wines, and do a good job suggesting what goes with what.And how about the food? Well, it's one of the best I've had in Singapore given the price. The ingredients are high quality. They taste amazing. The portions are generous. And the meats are tender and fresh. Every dish, be it veg or non-veg, have exceeded expectations. The cherry on the cake is the dessert. We have always been served dessert for free in the form of delicious baclavas or pastries
2
This restaurant is hard to get to away from the city. And the service is pushy and rushed. Although they have 3 floors with seating, the tables are cramped and often higher floors are neglected by services staff. After coming here twice, I realized that customers of Caucasian decent get treated a lot better with a lot of better service and some additional specials. The restaurant is also quiet overpriced for what is essentially simple Greek cuisine. Overall the food is very delicious and the ambiance is nice. But the bias service, location and higher prices kinda leave me with a bad taste so I won't be coming back.
4
You can nearly transport yourself all the way to the Greek isles. The decor is very islandy and the food is great. One of my Greek favourites is Dolmades and Blu makes their own. I had them as a starter followed by grilled octopus tentacles which were delicious. They offered a selection of desserts on the house which were lovely, I particularly enjoyed the Yoghurt with honey and walnuts. You need to be prepared for big portions but if you do not have place to eat all of it they are more than happy to pack up the rest for your to take home. Wine list is Greek wines with some interesting choices for all pockets. Prices overall are higher than usual but with the huge portions they are actually good value. I think the trick is to share plates and get to taste more dishes than if you just have a starter and main. I shall be back to taste some mor

We booked this place for our Chinese New Year's Eve reunion dinner and it did not disappoint! The staff were friendly, the atmosphere was cosy and comfortable. Food was really tasty, albeit a bit oily (but I guess this is greek food!). The only downside was the price, but that can't be helped. I would come back here again!
5
Had a great night here - fantastic, tasty Greek food. Seafood was good. Genuine "cheap and cheerful" Greek restaurant feel to it. Reasonably priced. Wine list could do with some work though.
4
We had a lovely evening, food was amazing, really loved it, service was great, very attentive, and made us feel very welcome
4
Definitely one of our favourite restaurants in Singapore. Beautifully prepared food and very reasonable wine list. This time we had the lamb cutlets, chicken breast, and mince macaroni (have forgotten all the Greek names). Awesome meal, with a bottle of wine - around $S175
4
The food is great, the portions are well served and the seasoning is wonderful.
With a good Greek wine selection you can go all in with this experience.
It is not light food, but if definitely worth it.
5
Great Authentic Greek Food , been to many Greek Restaurants but that's a good one!
can recommend the Lamm Chops, the Greek Salad the Bisteki , good quality comes at a price !
5
This is the perfect spot to go for dinner with friends. The welcome is always warm and inviting, the atmosphere casual but sophisticated and the delicious and authentic dishes are big enough to be shared. The lamb is wonderful, the grilled sardines are the best, though strikes in Greece mean they are sometimes unavailable and the appetizers are amazing - a couple of standouts: the grilled saganaki with figs, the taramosalata (order the pita to go with it), the stuffed peppers and the zucchini dish. Good salads -the Greek one and the fava bean. Wine list is eclectic with an emphasis on Greek that the staff is happy to discuss. Blu Kouzina is a favorite and I just hope with the move to Dempsy Hill, the charm and quality go with them
5
Genuinely 1st rate effort at re-creating the traditional everyday greek cheap & cheerful setting. Staff are attentive but un-intrusive. Food is excellent - I can't think of a better Greek offering at this price anywhere on the island (and I've been here for 6+ years). Location is not the greatest if you live east or west but then again - how far away is anything really in Singapore! Would not think twice about going back
5
Mediterranean atmosphere everywhere: cozy and well decorated restaurant, with true and really good greek food, kind and friendly staff and reasonable priced. I would specially recommend the lamb chops but even the basic greek salad was great and all ingredients had a really fresh taste. Now I realized why is in the top 3 restaurants in SG. I enjoyed more here than in other expensive fine dinning restaurants for not even half of the price.Totally worth the visit
4
We went there to celebrate a friend's birthday. The staff must have overheard us wishing her "Happy Birthday!" and surprised us with desserts topped with a candle at the end of our dinner! Such attention to details is what keeps me going back when I'm in town
3
Few of our friends had gushed about this place and I was pleasantly surprised to see such amazing reviews on trip advisor. This a small, cozy place on a quiet Bukit Timah road. The portions are huge and justify the price on the menu. The food, we felt, was nice but not great or amazing. Mousaka was definitely my favourite dish. It's just so creamy and delicious and melts in your mouth. The grilled lamb chops were cooked to perfection. The spinach pide or spanakopita was okay- pastry good, the filling so-so and the dish overpriced. The Greek salad was a bit too salty for our palate. It's a big portion and comes with a big slab of feta cheese. In fact, except mousaka, the seasoning on all dishes were a tad too high on salt and hence overpowering. Overall, did we like it? Yes we did. Did we love it? No. But a good option for Greek food in Singapore since there are not a lot of choices for Greek food here.
4
The place was nicely done. The food was great! Had a great time with my friends celebrating her birthday!
5
This is our favorite restaurant in Singapore. Quality of the food is great, the selection of the menu and the ambience makes us feel like in holidays on a Greek island. Greek wine is also very nice! Highly recommended! Enjoy!
5
Very niche spot, authentic menu and flavors. Definitely suggest making a reservation as they get quite full. Not much space outside/downstairs, so could be tough for people with mobility issues, but love the older style location and the charming decor. Lamb and meatballs were excellent!
4
Excellent ambience, great location, personalised service and authentic food.
An afternoon well spent.
5
Andreas and Christos make u feel like in greece . Tasty salad w eccellent Olive oil. very good and affordable wines. the big meat platter for me. there only very few Greek restaurants in sing but this is by far the best.
5
We have been here a few times and really enjoy the food, wine & service :). As a vegetarian I find that they have quite a few options too, which is very refreshing. The only thing I would suggest is that you don't sit on the ground floor as it can get quite warm. Other than that it is great
5
This is one of my family's favourite restaurants in Singapore. The food served is authentic, homely, hearty and unpretentious. You see and feel the passion and pride in the owners and servers, which makes dining here so wonderful. Recommended dishes: the Horiatiki (feta cheese salad), Mousaka (oven-baked eggplant & mince meat), Gemista (stuffed grilled vegetables), any of the meat platters, and the Baklava. Delicious
5
A group of us went for dinner to Blu Kouzina one evening. The experience was great from start to finish. The staff were very helpful and knowledgeable. Their wine and food suggestions were very good. The food was presented nicely and everything we had tasted great. It all arrived to our table in a timely manner. A big thank you to Blu Kouziba! We'll be back
5
Every single dish that we ordered was exquisite.. I went here with friends almost a year ago. I would suggest this place to all vegetarians too as 3 out of the 4 of us were vegetarians and they loved their food.Service was very courteous too..Big Thumps up!
5
I love this place. The only down side is that the fresh bread smells so good and I remember the amazing flat bread freshly made for the souvlakis from my pre coeliac days. There is plenty to order that is safe though. Just ask and the lovely staff will help
5
Delicious food, Tasty meat!!
Not cheap but for sure worth it every cent!!!!
If this restaurant was at the beach, it would be a perfect place!
5
Awesome food and good services. You wont be disappointed. The lamb was well season and cooked. It was very tender.
4
went back to this restaurant - because the food is fantastic. ordered the same lamb chops, grilled jumbo prawns, etc. the hummus and melitzanosalata (smoked egg-plant) is also super. AND the olive oil - lip-smacking.
5
This was the second time we ate here, and it didn't disappoint. We had a lot of pitta & dips, calamari, meat balls & the feta salad. Delicious!
Service is also great, we'll be back soon!
5
Love the grilled octopus, mousaka and baklava. A little overpriced but will certainly go back for more. Service is very good.
5
My wife and I had visited the restaurant for our anniversary dinner. All i asked for was a nicely located table and vegetarian food while making the reservation. But the manager, Chris, went out of his way to make it a great dining experience. The food was excellent. We had the Fava and the Spanakopita for starters. The presentation could be better for the fava, but it hit the spot. For our mains I had the chicken wrap and she had the spinach rice. I went with Chris' recommendation on those and they did not disappoint. The restaurant has a very busy but homely vibe to it. So even if the presentation is not instagram friendly :-), BK makes up for that in taste and service. I would visit again soon. The lamb and the beef cutlets on the next table looked great:-
5
8 of us went for a birthday. The owner helped with all of our ordering, advised us on platters, quantities and wine. He was fun and engaging, and once he found out about the birthday, treated us to a shot and dessert. It was a lovely time and the best meat we've had in Singapore for a long time
5
The best Greek restaurant in Singapore - and one of the top outside of Greece that I have eaten in. All the food cooked and seasoned exceptionally well, and I always leave wishing I had room for more. The other half is Greek and it takes a lot to please the Greek palate, and we continue to return time and time again. Hats off to the kitchen staff and front of house for given many nights of great food and ambiance. Keep up the great work

Blu Kouzina has been a place that I've been wanting to try out for years. Situated in a plush residential area on Bukit Tima Road. It's white and blue colours gives a very comortable and friendly vibe. I've always seen groups of friends sharing a hearty meal together spiced with Greek food.The first floor dining area is more of an open concept with a view of the kitchen and the main bukit timah road. The upstairs dining area is air conditioned and is more spacious, capable of seating dining groups of 10pax. The walls are painted blue and the chairs and tables are wooden painted in white. There's alot of daylight that comes in through the main windows facing Bukit Timah Road.Looking at the menu, they have very interesting offerings, such as grilled seafood platters, with the *hint that the fresh fish are from greece. The prices were pretty reasonable too. Here at Blu Kouzina, they place high importance on their extra virgin olive oil as it is their family's signature recipe!Every table gets complimentary bread and go crazy with the olive oil!!The bread itself was yeasty and had a nice salty flavour to it. The olive oil brought about a nice fruity flavour and aroma that leaves me mouth wanting for more!1. Talagani Saganak $18.80++We decided to go out of our comfort zone and try something new. This is sheep milk cheese from Messinia topped with blu sauce. The portion may look seemingly small, but do not be fooled. The cheese is quite thick and dense. Two wedges of this and I was quite good!The edges of the cheese had a slight charring and was sometimes crispy, almost flaky. The cheese itself didn't smell too cheesey, which I was afraid of. Instead it had a mild sweet aroma and each bite was soft and chewy, almost like biting into a cheese stuffed bun. It was an interesting experience. Do give it a try!2. Mousaka $27.80++Can I give this item 6 stars? It's the best Mousaka I have ever tried hands down, and this is not my first time trying it! A mousaka consists of oven baked eggplant with potatoes, minced meat and bechamel sauce. It came in a piping hot bowl with a very flat and smooth surface, off the top of the potatoes. You could see the slightly burnt edges, which were my personal favourite as it was slightly crisp!Check out the eggplant~! They were generous with the ingreidents. The eggplant were so soft and moist, it had all the flavour from the minced meat. The skin of the eggplant had a nice silky texture to it too. Eaten together with the extremely flavourful and almost cotton candy styled mash potatoes, I was in heaven! Or Greece! Or Greek Heaven?!The minced meat was very tender, and you could tell it was well seasoned, fresh and alot of effort was taken into preparing this dish. Not all mousakas I've tried had such soft and tender minced meat, most had clumped up meat, being that it is seated at the bottom of the bowl.3. Kalamaki Souvlak $15.80++Beef kalamaki served with fresh onion, sliced tomato, in-house bread and lemon. After a very appetizing and excellent 6 star start of the lunch, this turned out to be just average and didn't quite WOW us like the other dishes. The beef had lots of juices, but the meat just tasted normal and I was contemplating not finishing this dish.I did like their in-house bread which was more like a toasted garlic bread that had a very biscuity texture. For the price, I think this is one of their cheapest main courses.4. Xtapodi Sxaras $29.80++You know that Blu Kouzina works with the freshest of ingredients, some especially flown from Greece when you try this grilled octopus. It's like no other octopus I've tried. It is so tender, almost like a juicy chicken breast!This was a huge octopus piece, this blew our mind as we did not envision this! We starteed to slice up the octopus tail and stunningly, we realized how tender the meat was as you could literally cut it all up with a butter knife! The octopus had a very subtle flavour and aroma, but you could distinctly taste and smell the grilled goodness.5. Desserts (Complimentary)Baklava - Filo pastry filled with walnuts and topped with Blu Kouzina's homemade syrup. I usually shy away from Baklava as it's too sweet for my liking, but this wasn't the case here. The flaky pastry was so flaky, I had difficulty trying to fork it! But the pastry melted in my mouth in an instant, before my mind started to realized there were chunks of walnuts embedded inside this sweet and delicious Baklava!Galaktoboureko - Filo patry filled with semolina cream filing and topped with homemade syrupBougatsa - Filo pastry filled with semolina cream filing, served hot with powered and icing sugar and cinammon. This pastry was indeed hot, you could feel it as I held up this plate in the palm of my hand. The cream filing oozed out and literally dissolved in my mouth! It was perfect, a great bread of sweetness and warmthOverall : Blu Kouzina will take you through a short trip to Greece. A trip you will NOT regret!
5
Not only the interior would transfer you to Greece, but the food served are Greekly yummy too! We ordered many dishes for sharing and this way was perfect as we got to try more dishes and still came out feeling very full! The staff are very friendly and welcoming... Recommended!
5
I love that this is a casual place that offers excellent quality greek food. Must book in advance. Service is fast but not too friendly.
5
This simple place is one of the best in Singapore: wonderful selection of well-prepared dishes, perfect grilled fish and nice selection of Greek wines that are not terribly expensive. Perfect experience overall, highly recommended!
4
Great food in a very cute setting. Very good selection of greek wine.
This place will become one of my favourites hands down! Great prices as well, do not hesitate to give it a try!
5
We had a delicious meal at blu Kouzina again...Second time at this restaurant, even better than our first experience!!!
5
Apart from the lighting which I found to be very bright, I couldn't fault anything about our evening at Blu Kouzina
5
We booked the function room for a private group dinner! It was amazing. The food was wonderful and the service was fabulous.
5
I went with my family to blu Kouzina for my birthday last year. We are vegetarian and there where lots of options on the menu for us. We were very impressed with the food and how fresh it tasted. Just before we went to leave they brought me a dessert with a candle and sang happy birthday. It was a nice surprise and the dessert was delicious! I Blu Kouzina is Officially one of my favorite restaurants in Singapore. :)
5
We have been regular diners at Blu Kouzina for the last couple of years now. The service is always quick and responsive, the owners and long term staff George and Chris always greet us by our names and we always feel welcomed and at home there no matter who we go with.The food is delicious, our favorite dishes include hot cheese served with figs, pan fried zucchini with feta cheese, Greek salad, rocket salad with haloumi, beef skewers, lamb chops and sea bass or sea bream. The Greek yoghurt served with honey and walnut is delicious and so are the other deserts.A casual, cosy and chilled out place to hang out with good friends and family for a happy and hearty evening. Highly recommended
4
The frontage defies 3 levels of dining and the interior makes you feel like you could be in the mediterranean - very authentically Greek! The staff are great and very accommodating to requests. We loved all the starters but some of us a bit disappointed with the other dishes. The rice with spinach was so packed full of dill that there was no other flavour. Overall it is a good dining experience howeve
5
Hard to get a seat at this popular restaurant unless you book in advance but really worth it. I find the food so authentic and the service so friendly. Love the grill items for that true smokey flavours especially the seafood items. Have yet to be disappointed on any of our multiple return visits.
4
Interior of the restaurant is cosy and nicely-designed in blue and white. The food was delicious and service was attentive and friendly. Will go back for more Greek cuisine next time!
5
The service and food was great! We had multiple appetizers and dinner options. Need a reservation but so worth it.
5
good ambience, the management sure know how to please their guests. will return but will need Chope to assist
5
Delicious authentic Greek food with generous drizzles of olive oil from their own produce. But what really makes the difference is the warm, friendly service with a personal touch each time I've been here.
4
Located at Bukit Timah, tucked this cozy Greek restaurant Blu Kouzina. The menu have dishes from the sea, farm and interesting appetizers. Most important it's tastes delicious. The staff there are very friendly and attentive. I have been there a couple of times and it has been consistent. Average price per head will be about S$70. I would recommend making a reservation and places can be filled up quite easily.
5
Was surprised at the quality of food at this small and quaint restaurant that is decorated in the Blue that we see often from ads about Greece. Prob Owner and staff are from Greece (due to the language they spoke) making me believe this is as authentic as you can get for a Greece restaurant. The 4 of us had the following for dinner: Dolmades Gialatzi (Vine leaves stuffed with rice), Fava (Yellow lentils w/fresh onions, oregano and extra virgin olive oil), Taztziki (Yogurt mixed with cucumber, extra virgin olive oil and falvoured w/garlic) Taramosalata (White cod roe dip) plus Pita. For the mains we had Xtapodi Shara (Grilled Octopus. The Octopus came from Greece), Paidakia stin Shara (Grilled lamb chops served with patates tiganites and vegetable of the day), and Mousaka (Oven baked eggplant with potatoes mincemeat and bÃ©chamel sauce). There was on room for dessert. Food is extremely good quality and I would love to come back again soon
5
Located in bukit timah Road, this is a Greek restaurant with about 4 levels.The wine was great, the chardonnay we ordered was not too dry or fruity, just right. The house Greek white wine was also good, although a bit acidic.The food was good, cooked just right and the portions were sufficient for 4. We ordered 2 starters and 2 main courses.Would recommend octopus and grilled macaroni with mince meat for the main course.The service was good, attentive and always ready to provide helpful recommendations on wine and food
5
Wife and I together with another couple visited Blu Kouzina for lunch last week. We ordered the spinach rice, moussaka, sardines, the Melanzana dish and other stuff. The spinach rice was superb -perfectly cooked with just the right balance of spinach and rice together with a dash of lime. The sardines were good but my friend found the portion small for his liking. We followed it up with 3 desserts - the best of them by far was the baklava -Crisp, crunchy, great honey and nuts. Highly recommendAsk for the seats upstairs - those are the best spots
5
I spent 3 weeks in the summer travelling around the Greek Islands and became a big fan of the food. Greek food is often very simple so requires great ingredients for example delicious fresh vegetables and this is where the problem lies when you try Greek food in Asia.. The ingredients just aren't tasty enough... This is the view I had until I found Blu Kouzina. It's quite far out of town but it's worth the trek. You can sit outside or inside on one of the 3 floors, either is great so check what is available when you book (which you must do) we had the Greek salad which was to die for, the fresh fish flown in from Greece, octopus which melted in your mouth and the mezze platter. The chefs are mostly locals but the owners are Greek and fly in most of the ingredients so you are guaranteed an authentic experience. If you want genuine Greek food for a couple dining out or hanging out with friends go here.
5
Came here to celebrate my wife's birthday. We ordered bougiordi as appetizer and Kalamari Shari and Bifteki Shin Shara for the main dish. The food was all really good. We even had some leftovers since the quantities are huge compared to Singapore standards. They offer you free bread at the beginning with olive oil so order your food taking this into account. The service by the young Greek lad was simply fantastic. I could see him running around being very busy but not for a moment did he stop smiling and obliging to our requests. We were also given a complimentary dessert to celebrate my wife's birthday which was really delicious too! The ambience is very Greek and I would definitely recommend a visit. This place is super popular, make sure that you book at least a week in advance.
5
Ordered 4 items. Fresh and delicious food. Nice ambience. Good service. Thoughtful too :) Will go back!
5
Best dolmades and feta I've ever had. And the homemade bread is ridiculous. Perfect ambience-- felt like I was in the Mediterranean. Well worth the trip and price!! The owners are definitely Greek which means extra points. A+++ dining experience.
5
Great food, awesome service. Was given great food advice and they also waived our corkage. Very decently priced. So happy with everything!
5
wholesome and tasty. Definitely worth the prices. Friendly atmosphere. If you have trouble climbing stairs...tell them not to reserve the table on floors above. Narrow staircase.
5
Visited the place with friends - group of ten. Appetizers and grilled vegetables were great. Cheese was delicious. I have not tried the fish but friends said it was perfectly grilled. I was surprised when the chief told us that the majority of the products like seafood, cheese, and many more are airflow every week. Wines were also directly from Greece. The bill was a bit on higher side but we really enjoyed the food. Thanks.
4
Authentic tasting Greek dishes accompanied with hospitable service by the service crew. Portions are huge, be careful not to over order if you are heading there with girlfriends. Highly recommend the trio dip (off the menu and I think it cost around $29) with the pita bread.
3
Went with friends on a Wed night and it was quite busy. The building is a little hard to find and the layout of the restaurant quite odd but this is due to a very narrow and tall building. But nice ambience upstairs for a small group. The food was more traditional than expected and tasty, seems to have real greeks running the place! Had a great night, possibly due to my friend speaks greek and also knew what to order. Don't know about value for money, my friend ordered and paid.
5
It was over three years since last, but it still has the same beautiful food and the service is good enough from some of the staff and excellent from others.This is as good as anything you get in a Greek restaurant in Greece if you ask me
2
This restaurant is definitely below average. I went on a Friday night and made a booking for 4. They seated us in a table for 2 as they lost our booking. The food and the wine is really expensive for what they give. Portions are small and the meat was hard and overcooked. Paid $80 for a bottle of wine that you find for $50 in other restaurants. Not going agai
4
After a long time we visited Blu Kouzina again last weekend. The food is very tasty and portions considerable big and service will advice you to be careful while ordering.In general service is very friendly,attentive and food is prepared fresh and can take a bit depends on your order. We had Pita,Tzatziki and Meat platter to share which was more then enough.Dessert was on the house with a great selection of Baklava,greek Yogurt with honey and roasted nuts and Filo Dough wrapped Semolina filling. Yummy..
5
Brought my bosses here and they absolutely loved the food! Service was excellent and their food was near perfect. Will definitely visit again!
5
We want last Sunday for lunch at Blu Kouzina. The food was very excellent and the service as well.
It is one of the best meals we had in Singapore, so far.
5
Delicious Greek food, great produce, fair value and great environment. If you feel like Greek food - head down to Blu Kouzina.
Family friendly.
5
One of our favourite places to go for a leisurely sunday lunch. Over the years the food is consistently fresh & flavourful & the service warm & genuine.
Do try the grilled octopus & the grilled cheese with fig chutney. Delicious!
5
I found this reataurant in our hotel room guide book. We were a table of 6 (2 young children), some of us seafood lovers and the others carnivores. This reataurant suited us all and was amazing. It was our most memorable night in Singapore.
5
This place is a gem for get together. We had the sirloin and fillet plus the seafood platter, perfect combination of meat and seafood. Enjoyed the food and the experience very much.
5
We have visited Blu Kouzina several times and have always found the food to be delicious and service excellent. Accompanying the food there is a good selection of wines that are reasonably priced.
5
I am coeliac and they catered so well for my dietary requirements but at the same time everyone else thoroughly enjoyed their non gluten free food. Very impressed!
5
The meal was sumptuous, with delicious Greek cuisine being served. The staff were friendly and very helpful. I would certainly pay this restaurant another visit!
4
Blu Kouzina has great ambiance - the olive oil cans making up one side of the railings on the stairways is a cute touch! The menu is exhaustive and has an array of delicious sounding starters, mains, and desserts. The Melitzanosalata (Eggplant dip) with Pita and the Greek Salad were stand outs among the starters - beautifully presented, lightly dressed, and great to taste! They did a vegetable Moussaka and Souvlaki, which were really good. The desserts and Limoncello to finish the meal were awesome too. I'm definitely going back for more
5
The atmosphere that you breath is fantastic, the food and service is excellent. Standard after several visit is always there. Highly recommended.
5
Everything was spot on, flavourful. Worth every cent and one of my favourite restaurants in singapore. Comprehensive greek authentic menu. Good wines. Excellent service. Always happy here. Highly recommend.
4
A home-feel and friendly restaurant. Authentic taste and nice decorations. Just a little cramp for a big group. I'm comfortable to recommend it to my family and friend.
5
What an amazing treat. We were 5 in our group. Ordered 7-8 dishes. Each one of them was outstanding in taste. Loved it.
Staff was professional, service was prompt but not rushed. Perfect.
The place is casual, but classy too....in a homely way.

Had dinner with a couple of girlfriends last night. The food was excellent, v flavourful - - had the grilled octopus, grilled meat platter and Greek salad. Service was friendly, prompt and efficient. Dessert was bougatsa (warm filo pastry filled with semolina cream) and baklava (on the house ) both delicious and not too sweet. On the whole a lovely evening out. The restaurant was packed on a Wednesday night. We didn't get to try the grilled sardines which were sold out - definitely be back!

Celebrated my birthday at Blue Kouzina. Booking online was a breeze. Parking is limited but the restaurant offers valet parking. We were greeted at the door by name and given a lovely table by the window. Waitstaff was most apologetic that the restaurant had run out of grilled sardines and fig saganaki, fortunately they still had grilled octopus, which is perfectly grilled with crisp edges and juicy tender tentacles . They also recommended a half portion of the meat platter for two, which was more than sufficient for two of us to share. Made the mistake of asking for medium doneness, should've requested medium rare, but meat was still tender and perfectly seasoned. House white wine is well worth a try. Restaurant surprised us with a complimentary birthday dessert platter and limoncello shots. Everybody should come here to celebrate their birthdays. Do make reservations, restaurant was full on a Thursday night when we went

I really tried he's to like this place. The food is good, if a bit pricey. However the service is wholly unacceptable. At no time were we made to feel welcome. We were rudely and quickly ushered to our table. The waiter rush us during the order, actually telling us "hurry up" and behaving like a surely teenager. When asked if we could have one dish well done, he refused even after we states that this was for a pregnant diner. Again unacceptable and made no suggestions to help. The final straw was the dessert fraud. I can't call it anything else. A tray of dessert arrived (without asking) which we thought was an apology for the service. However the final insult and fraud was the charge appearing on the bill. Never again

Having holidayed many times in Greece we were very pleased to find this gem of a Restuarant from the moment we arrived to the moment we left the hospitality was so welcoming. People were interacting with each other's tables as it was birthday celebrations for some, there were families, couples and groups there and it had that great European socially eating vibe going on. The food was very good my lamb chops were perfectly pink as requested and my husbands baby chicken was moist and flavorsome. Little things go along way, I ordered Vodka & Tonic and they brought me ice, lemon and tonic for me to mix my own which I love as they tend to skim on tonic here in Singapore. They also gave us local Greek deserts on the house. Great night I would recommend this to anyone and will go back regularly. Your staff and your family are a credit to you.

We go to Blu Kouzina on a weekend for fresh Mediterranean seafood cooked in a fabulous Greek style. It is our place for comfort food in SG. We never hesitate to take our visiting friends to this place that is always friendly and busy. Suggest to book in advance
5
Well, a trip here with around 10 people and we tried almost everything. I must say i simply can't flaw anything!!! The service was excellent, the next course just better than the last. Price was mid range, fairly costly, but fully worth the pennies.Well done guys!!! you are shinning light in Singapore
5
Authentic Greek food and authentic Greek atmosphere. Go for the specials if available. We loved the grilled octopus. Good Greek wine list. Maybe a little pricey but you get a lot of food so don't over order.
5
Super friendly staff which is a nice change! Food always delicious!
Finding parking wasn't easy BUT was told if you pull-up at the front they do valet.
3
Have eaten here twice. Food is OK. We had lamb chops, meatballs, tsaziki, fish etc. What I didn't like was the manager/ waiter. Not friendly....
4
My sister and I took our parents here for their anniversary. We were very well taken care of and the staff made sure we always had enough to drink (very important). The food was excellent; the meats were cooked perfectly. It's a plus that they offer a valet service as parking can be tricky around that area
4
Love it! We ordered 3 pcs. of rack of lamb, 2 king prawns, feta cheese, sea bass, simple, fresh and tasty. Filo dessert was just ok, to be fair, I don't have sweet tooth, apple should be caramelized not serve freshly cut I thought. Wine prices are higher than expected. Can't wait to bring my family to have a feast.
3
Food is OK but people not really friendly ! The decoration is OK but not fantastic. The strange thing it was full a Thursday night?The best was clearly the meat. We were 5 and we ate meatballs, beef brochette, hamburger in herbs and the very best the lamb chops really good.You can go if you live near bukit Timah Road if not . . 
4
Ordered a bunch of food. Lamb was succulent and tender, Moussaka was on point, Greek Salad came with a BLOCK of feta. I nearly died and and went to feta heaven. Food was good, and staff was great if not too attentive. I felt like I was always being watched which made me uneasy. I really can't fault them know, I know they are just trying to do a good job, and I also sensed that my server was a trainee. Despite feeling like all eyes were on us and everyone else, I would definitely return for great tastes
5
This was a return visit - one of many - and Blu Kouzina does not disappoint. We are always exceptionally pleased with the quality of the food, the Greek wine is marvelous - and the service is impeccable. The decor and ambiance are both very agreeable. This time we had a variety of foods from fried feta cheese to seabass and lamb and of course a selection of desserts.All perfectly done by the kitchen.Highly recommended albeit it is a bit of a journey from the CBD past business closing hours. 
5
One of my favorite places to eat at in Singapore. I always go back because the food, no matter what you order, is just perfect. The staff makes you always feel welcome and have good recommendations on wines or beers to go with your food. highly recommend this for people who love greek/mediterranean food or if you simply want to try something new
4
Sounds incongruous! Why would you try Greek food in Singapore? A party of 8 with 2 abstentions. To those who decided not to attend? Your loss! Wonderful salads, especially the Dakos Salata and the Horiatiki. Good selections of mains all washed down with Mythos Hellenic Lager. Thoroughly recommend for casual dining, nice atmosphere and local service
5
The staff and manangment of Blu Kouzina where fantastic. They made sure that this celebration was one we will never forget.
Food, wine, service, atmosphere and value makes Blu Kouzina the best restaurant in SG by a country mile
3
If you want to taste great Greek food in Singapore, Blu Kouzina is the place you should go to. Great location, nice ambient, amazing food, great service with reasonable price.
4
Very well made restaurant. Upstairs is really nice and cozy to seat. Good food. Overall good experience.
4
Very good the mix grill, portion for 2 is ok and the meat is well prepared. we tried retzina wine wich was good but expensive (though this is normal in singapore)
5
We were greeted warmly and made to feel very welcome. Started with the salad, which had fresh ingredients - feta cheese, olives, cucumbers - and combined with a subtle dressing. Salad was amazing and one of the finest ever that I have tasted. Ordered a bottle of Tanat wine, which was a superb bargain for a wonderful Greek wine and great accompaniment. As entrees we had the prawn and the baby roast chicken - both had simple subtle flavors, incredibly tasty. And we were given complimentary dessert without even asking. This is an expensive restaurant but a great value, I would come back for that special occasion. I have eaten at Greek restaurants only in the US, and have never been to Greece. This restaurant in a Singapore suburb was a very pleasant unexpected find
5
This was our second visit and once again we were blown away by how amazing the food tasted. The meat is mouth watering and the appetiser dips are just as good. The food is simple yet packed with full flavour.The service is excellent and you feel so welcome when you're there

This is going to be a long read. Blu Kouzina is probably our favourite restaurant in Singapore and we wax lyrical. We have never had anything less than an outstanding meal there, and Blu Kouzina delivered once again. Blu is a Greek Restaurant on Bukit Timah Road, owned and run by a Greek family. It is cheerfully decorated in a blue coastal theme reminiscent of the Mediterranean. Tables on the ground floor are two- and four-seaters around the open kitchen. There are two additional floors of seating. Our favourite, for no clear reason, is the second floor – perhaps it just feels more spacious. Get a table at the window if you can. Groups of up to eight are good at the restaurant; the tables being rectangular, members of a larger group might find themselves quite far from each other. It can get quite noisy, but we feel the buzz adds to the atmosphere. Although the food is very good, it feels more like a casual dining place as there are no table cloths, and the furniture and décor look the cheap and cheerful sort (though they probably aren’t, and fit the theme beautifully). We were looking for a very light meal and decided to stick with cheese and pita. The meal started with this great little loaf of crusty bread being left at your table to be had with the olive oil, salt and pepper already there. The bread was lightly salted or unsalted, and the rich olive oil and salt brought it to a sublime level. There were three of us and we shared two cheeses. The star was saganaki with figs (a favourite we never miss). It is a slice of kefalotiri, a hard and slightly strong sheep’s cheese fried in olive oil in a little pan called saganaki and topped with chunks of stewed (?) fig whose sweetness balances the soft, chewy fried cheese well. We also had grilled talagani, a cheese similar to halloumi (a soft sheep’s cheese) that was very good but in our minds, couldn’t compete with the kefalotiri.For our main we ordered a platter of assorted dips. This is no longer on the menu but is served on request. It is cheaper (smaller quantities) than ordering three individual dips and has a reasonable quantity of each dip for four people to share. We chose melitzanosalata, fava and tzadziki. Each of them seems deceptively simple but packs an amazing punch. Melitzanasalata appears to have nothing beyond (roasted and mashed) eggplant, chopped tomatoes, onions and olive oil, plus perhaps a few herbs. All fava has is boiled and mashed chickpeas, chopped onions and herbs. Tzadziki has little more than yoghurt, chopped cucumber, olive oil and garlic. But the blend of ingredients, probably painstakingly refined over centuries, not to mention the best quality ingredients used at Blu, results in combinations that are almost ambrosial. Each of us had a different favourite so we won’t try to pick the best. We paired the dips with pita, which are good, though perhaps a touch expensive – but a small price to pay for a great combination.We rounded out our meal with the baklava, which we thought touch dry, but very nutty and tasty nonetheless. So what did we miss? Plenty. We’ve been here a number of times and practically anything we’ve tried has turned out well, but let’s list our long list of favourites. Of the starters, taramosalata, a cod roe dip is fine if you like fishy dips (only one of us does) so that’s the one we drop when we go for the dip platter. The bougiourdi (red pepper stuffed with feta) is good but heavy for a starter and would be a mistake if your group has fewer than four. The spanakopita (phylo pastry filled with spinach & feta cheese) is also very good and worth a try. Of the mains, we would recommend the meat platter (or at least the lamb chops, which are outstanding), where we find the 2-person platter good enough for six (so long as you’re willing to share the lamb chops) when other dishes are being ordered, too. The grilled fish is very good too, though the sea bass also demands six to do it justice. We would also recommend the grilled squid and the grilled octopus.We would very highly recommend Blu Kouzina, whether it is for a casual dinner with friends or for a special occasion
4
Very busy so essential to book and in spite of a full restaurant the service was very slick, responsive and attentive. Excellent food and good selection - it would have been nice to have had hummus on the menu. Spanakopita was incredible. Only downside was the noise with a full restaurant and no carpets made it quite difficult to hear
5
This restaurant was recommended to us by my Greek friend who lived in Singapore. This was one of the best meals we had. The food was excellent and staff was lovely. Great choice and we will highly recommend this restaurant, is the hidden gem in Singapore
2
I spent my last 25 annual holidays in Greece. I have a pretty good idea of what greek hospitality normally offers. Nine out of ten greek tavernas or restaurangs show a fantastic hospitality. This was an exception. This is a "food factory" with great food but no general interest if you really thought the food was ok or if you were satisfied. As a conclusion they probably don't give a damn if I come back or not (Place was full this Saturday evening
4
I have been several times and never have i been disappointed by any dish. Food is great, Staff are friendly and great atmosphere. It doesn't matter if it is lunch or dinner always great ! grilled sardines are lovely.
5
Ambience is awesome! - The setting transports you to the Greek islands although the restaurant is situated in Singapore. Very friendly staff and we were served by the boss who was very patient in explaining his menu to us. Very delicious Greek dishes. Must try - an appetiser that is grilled cheese. Another delectable dish we ordered is grilled octopus; awesome
4
We spent a couple dinner at Blu Kouzina and had a very good time! First of all, we were really happy to find Mythos (Greek beer) in Singapore! You then have a great choice of dishes to share as appetizers before having one of the best souvlakis! Check is also very reasonable for Singapore which makes for an overall very very good experience. Will definitely go back
3
Love the ambience, decor and menu of this restaurant, it felt like I was transported into Santorini when I first stepped into it. Most of the mains were pretty good though a bit pricey for the portion and quality. I loved the fries with yoghurt and the desserts though I wished they carried a wider range. We had a kid too so the place was child-friendly and the waiters did their best to attend to our needs. What left a memorable impression was that they gave us free desserts when we were hesitant in ordering that and it turned out to be the best one on the menu! Very impressed with that. Overall, a great dining experience considering that they are always packed during public holidays. I will come back again to sample different mains especially when I miss Greece.. This place really does a good job in giving u the authentic Greek experience
5
Went for a quiet dinner on my wife's birthday. Was our first experience with Greek food. The place is run by two Greek brothers. Both take immense pleasure in serving you and take pains to explain each dish and also keep asking constant feedback on each dish. Our menu included- saganaki with figs, grilled fish sea bream, spanakopita, pita bread with 3 dips and moussaka. The spread was good, fresh ingredients, the portions generous. Sea bream and the saganaki were the highlights for us. The pita with 3 dips is probably not value for money you pay. The dessert was provided on the house considering the occasion. Costs worked out to 160 Singapore dollars for two people without alcohol
5
Tuck in at Bukit Timah area, the restaurant is not difficult to find with their authentic Blue and white Greek exterior. With their Open kitchen at Lvl 1, you can smell what's cooking.The foods are totally great taste. We love the smoked eggplant dip with pita bread. However I guess the Mousaka was the highlight of the dish as we didn't order a lot of food. Will definitely come back for another dishe
5
Could not have asked for more. Turned up with 6 people at 21:30, with no reservation. Nothing was too much trouble. Great service, wonderful food and price and quality were spot on. Everyone enjoyed the night. We even asked for an item not on the menu and they went out of their way to provided it. Perfect. We'll be going back and only here for two weeks
4
Singapore is very limited when it comes to Greek cuisine, so thankfully there is Blu Kouzina. Unfortunately, it is very tough to get in without a reservation made at least a week in advance. The food was all very good, nice selection of Greek wines, and friendly service by real Greek staff! Recommend getting there by taxi, as it's bit off the beaten path, but the location and interior is very nice
4
Had a good dinner at Blu Kouzina. Our favorite was the appetizer of fish roe dip and pita bread. We had grilled lamb, grilled octopus, grilled fish and baked chicken. All tasted very good. Portions looked small but were filling. Dessert was small but a bit underwhelming. Drinks were good; they have a great selection of greek wine, one type of greek beer and greek coffee. The only (small) downside was that it's a little pricey. Make sure to make a booking on weekends. I've never been to Greece so I can't say whether it's very authentic but the dishes do taste good
2
Singapore needs more than just one Greek restaurant. Like a modern democracy needs a credible opposition, the restaurant business needs more than one example of any particular ethnic cuisine. In this case, Blu Kouzina is fairly middling, partly because they have no competition. I have eaten Greek food all over the world and it is one of my favourites. What's on offer at Blu Kouzina is not bad, and touches many of the standard dishes "expected" on a Greek menu, but the end result is lacklustre. Souvlaki could be tastier, potatoes could be more lemony, rice could be tastier, fresh oregano and parsley could be deployed more liberally, and there should be a better variety of cheese, olives and pickles on offer. Clearly, the staff expect all groups to be spending $500 minimum, so treat normal customers with a slight disdain - more appropriate for French or high-end Italian restaurants, perhaps. The location is awful - right in the middle of a block on a busy road (Bukit Timah Rd) with few options for even a taxi to stop. The restaurant is in a three-story shophouse and there is very little room. With the kitchen on the ground floor, there are only two options: eat outside (an option I usually love elsewhere) or climb stairs. Going up these stairs (no handrail, a few overflow pantry items) is not too bad, but coming back down after a bottle of wine is a nightmare. Worse, the staff have to use the same stairways to get up and down to the upper dining floors. Nasty. Also, the space is very small. Tables are very close together so getting in and out is tough. Outside dining is an option for couples, but it's not a nice environment. You're in the open, on a busy road with lots of noise and not much scenery or passers-by. Finally, the price (remember, this is a monopoly) is reminiscent of CBD-located Italian restaurants, not "local suburbs". OK, it's generally in the Sixth Avenue food district, but it is priced out of that market. It's comparable to some of the places at Greenwood, not too far away, but without the great ambience of that neighbourhood. Overall, it's a miss for me
4
Probably the best Greek restaurant in Singapore and one of the best overall Mediterranean restaurants in South East Asia.
The prices are a bit on the high side, but the amazing food and great personal service make up for it.
5
Awesome food, great service and great online tools to get a reservation. One of my favourite places in Singapore
4
Great food and great atmosphere.We came on a Tuesday night and the place was almost full.We had Greek salad (amazing, no less), moussaka (very good) and other dishes. It was all very good.Service is friendly and good even if not very professional. Prices... Well, on the higher side. A bit too high...In any case, we will be back.
5
Having just got back from Greece in June this year, my friends and I decided to relive our amazing Greek experience at Blu Kouzina! Though our table did not overlook the caldera and the bluest of blue Agean the sea, the atmosphere in the restaurant was memorably Greek! The interior decor, Greek wine and the food was great! The baberganoush, spicy red pepper stuffed with Feta cheese and lamb cooked to perfection was very good! Would definitely revisit the Blu Kouzina!
4
The Greek dÃ©cor brings back memories of distant times in that country and therefore we sat down with high expectations. The food delivers. The kids had never eaten greek food before. They were non believers when they first looked at the menu later they ended up ordering a second serve of the lamb chops the food was so good. The greek salad and seafood platter were also excellent. The only disappointing thing about the menu is having too many mouth watering choices for one meal. There are so many dishes I didn't get to try. The service was very friendly and helpful. The food came quickly. However, the single waiter in our section was overworked so service was a little patchy. The restaurant was very busy so probably at other times it would not be an issue. One small suggestion would be to repaint the ceiling in the section where we were sitting as it was looking a little worse for wear
5
We come to Blu Kouzina with everyone we know, and for the few people that havent already fallen in love before, it quickly becomes a favorite. Everything on the menu is excellent -- perhaps the only complaint is our waistline as we can't help but order many of the appetisers before even getting to mains. However, the amazing food is just part of the experience: Blu Kouzina is operated by actual Greek people who pride themselves on hospitality and atmosphere. The owners and managers recognize and take care of regular customers yet never ignore newcomers, and the atmosphere makes for a wonderfully relaxing evening often finished by complementary dessert and/or ouzo when customers have had a full meal with drinks etc.Despite the many good restaurants in Singapore, this remains one of the few that I've returned to well over a dozen times and will remain high on my list for showing visiting friends a good night out
5
I took my parents to this restaurant for dinner and all of us loved it, especially my mum who is vegetarian since there were a lot of vegetarian options too. The portions were generous as well. The lamb ribs were among the best I've had. The eggplant moussaka was good too. The best part was the complimentary dessert we got
3
Nothing was wow to me for all dishes we ordered. They've got good choices of red wine though. One of my friend who's living in the area recommended this place. The decorations is nice I quite like it. But I can find many restaurants in Singapore that have a nice decoration. So, likely will not be return.
5
I went to this restaurant at least once per month during my five year stint in Singapore... Wow, the food quality, speed and service is just incredible. I would put their food up amongst the best in the world. Also the Greek wines are priced well, especially for Singapore. Their greek salad is amazing as well as the Kofte. Try the seafood and meat platter
5
This was my third visit in six months. Food is simple, authentic and well done. Unusual for Singapore - the service is excellent and friendly. The staff actually seem happy to be there. It isn't cheap, and can be difficult to get a table at times but I would recommend this to anyone that likes simple Mediterranean food with good quality ingredients
5
It's hard to decide what to order with such a fantastic menu. The staff are always helpful and we end up having a wonderful evening and ALWAYS end up eating far to much.
5
Fantastic Greek food, service and value for money! The staff looked after us all afternoon, not a bad dish on the menu!
5
Despite just coming back from our Honeymoon in Greece 2 wks ago, we missed the food. Blu Kouzina really is a gem found!
4
Very nice and bright restaurant with colours which resemble Santorini. Be ready for authentic experience which means tables that are very close to each other and very friendly staff always ready to help. The reach menu provides you with such a variety of deliciousness that its really hard to make your choice. Thankfully the owner/manager is always there to give you a good advise on whats worth trying and how to mix your mains/appetisers to achieve real greek flavour balance. I love the baked cheese starter (Saganaki) and of the main courses the octopus (Xtopadi) was absolutely delicious. Vine list offers some interesting and reasonably priced Greek flavours. Not on the cheap side - (For a dinner for 2 with starters and some desserts expect to pay about $200) - but well worth it 
5
My 3rd visit to this gem of a restaurant off Bukit Timah Rd. True Greek cuisine supervised by the friend,y and hands-on owner, George, who has managed to create a cosy, authentic taverna despite a busy highway next door. The food is truly excellent - the real deal! In fact, even going down to the basic Greek salad, it's spot-on! Exactly how I had it 15 years ago in Greece / Crete - no salad leaves, but sweet tomatoes and cucumber , tasty kalamata olives and.... A generous full slice of feta cheese on the top. No crumbly excuses of feta as so many restaurants offer. "Feta" after all, means "slice", not crumbs.... The dips, Greek style grilled calamari, lamb, chicken breast and souvlaki beef that we all ordered was superb and as one would have imagined in Greece. No shortcuts. A fabulous atmosphere too not only for the decor but also because the owner plays soft Greek music in the background and he himself mingles with customers to chat, take orders and advise. Excellent service and a great wine selection, including Greek wines. In fact, one from the owner's own home island (Santorini) warranted an order of a 2nd bottle....
4
Great ambiance. I Loved the light blue and white colours. Brought back memories from when I was traveling the Mediterranean. Their greek salad is a most! Go adventurous and ask for a Greek wine. Great quality at a great price. Very good service and recommendations. Make sure you make reservation. Place gets crowded very fast.Loved the outdoor seating
4
Very nice place. Very authentic. Food is a lot. We could not manage to finish everything. We had some basics and a meat platter for two which was very nice.Recommend this place to everyone who wants nice greek food in SEA.Nevertheless a little pricy..
5
I've been here umpteen number of times and I've always had a fantastic time. The lamb chops are delectable - a must try. I do love the decor of the place as well, a happy blue - makes you feel like you're on a summer vacation!
5
Plan in advance and make a reservation, especially for dinner. We made reservations for a Sunday lunch and we were not disappointed.The food is fantastic and the service is friendly. I would suggest ordering a trio of dips with pita bread, I don't think this is on the menu but I believe everyone orders it, and go ahead and order two pita orders, you'll want more. We also ordered the Spanakopita which was unbelievably good, the phylo and philling was phantastic! We also ordered the Souvlaki me Pita which was also great, a nice combination of flavours all working well together. One small complaint, they advise you to eat it wrapped, but with the chunk beef it falls apart way to easily, tighter wrapping or better paper to wrap it in, but the taste is worth the eventual mess. The fries with this was also a nice surprise. The Bifteki stin Shara was a bit oily (Greasy?) but the flavour was again great and the meat was so soft and tender.In addition to all of the great food, the ambiance was lovely and the service was friendly, as friendly as a Greek man can be. :) Even bringing out special kids plates and being very patient as well.Definitely highly recommended and already looking forward to a return
4
I rarely find food in Singapore that satisfies my cravings (unless its local food). I had been told about this place from many expats. We had a girls night on a Friday night. Make reservations as you will need it for this popular place. Great selections of wine and beer. We had 5 appraisers as we all wanted to try a variety, and were we pleased! The feta cheese came in a nice big block with olive oil and spices, hummus was rich and creamy, defiantly homemade. Moussaka was very well seasoned and tasty. Environment reminds me of a Greek restaurant on the water, white and blue interior. Seating outside, outside covered and inside with a/c. Owners were helpful in suggesting dishes. Cooks were excite when we shouted OPA! after every dish. I only saw adults at this establishment so not sure if it would be good for children, but it is a definite great date night if you are craving some Greek food
5
Visited more than once... their food is divine and the drinks are good, also! Even the appetizer was amazing.. very authentic and they make and sell their own olive oil! Highly recommend.
4
Great little place! Nice service with friendly and funny waiters. But most important very good food. All dishes (appetizers, meat and fish) are very tasty. I recommend a table downstairs near the kitchen as 1st floor is a bit noisy.Oh, one last thing, their corkage fee is only 25$ and they waive it if you buy another bottle. Pretty cool for groups!Try it
4
I love the decor and friendly service at Blu Kouzina. Not sure if it's authentic since I've never been to Greece, but the food sure is yummy. However, it is also very pricey. A simple meal could easily cost $100 for 2 pax. Portions are big though, so best to come in larger groups for sharing.
4
Very cozy restaurant with rustic decor and clean white furniture, Must tries is the meat platter and mousaka, grilled squid was yummy as well. The food and service was excellent, so be prepared to spend abit (about S$40 per pax).Had a birthday gathering there and they gave out free shots so it was well worth it! Overall it was a great experience filled with good memories and I would definitely go back again
5
We ate dinner at Blu Kouzina last night at the recommendation of a friend. the restaurant had a cozy feel and one of the owner's who served us provided fantastic service. Food and wine ordered was served piping hot and pretty quickly on ordering. the wine was chilled to perfection (and a fantastic chardonnay at that). The food of course was the hero. We ordered the grilled octopus which was to die for, the fried cheese with fig chutney, grilled sardines, 3 bean salad and lamb chops. Everything was cooked to perfection. Dessert was Number 2 on the menu which I can't remember the name :) it was delicious and a kind of semolina dessert in filo pastry. Not too sweet and the perfect ending to a scrumptious meal. Will definitely be going back .... Highly recommended. We paid 65/- per person with a bottle of wine between us. Good value I think for the quality and experience ..
5
Was suggested by a friend. This place is located in a cosy corner of a block facing bukit timah. We had a table for 8 adults, not far from kitchen. Decor was nice and menu cards were elegant. We could see what other patrons were being served and hence could make informed choices.Starters were yummy and we repeated some of them...pita, eggplant, fava, salad etc. Though it sounds like a standard offering, it tasted far better. We ordered lamb, beef, chicken and stuffed capsicum for main course. Baklava was ordered for dessert. We tried few canned drinks, greek beer and greek liquer (not to our taste).Overall, we were very pleased with the offering. We will definitely return
4
It's a shame that most of the good restaurants in Sg are on no ideal locationsBlu Kouzina is a Greek restaurant with good food at a decent value for money (for SG standards)The sharing plates are a good options (meats) as well as salad and other healthy options The Greek beer is also a good option Good for taking your couple and disconnect from Asi
5
Admittedly I'm no Greek food Connesieur, but whatever I ate here, was excellent. The dips, the grilled seafood and meats, were all fantastic. Totally recommend eating with a larger group so you can try everything. Lamb Chops, and grilled octopus/prawns are great!!Service has never been a problem
3
As one of the only Greek restaurants in Singapore we had high hopes. It was good, but not fantastic. The octopus was fantastic, the tarama was great, as was the bread. The Souvlaki was beef not lamb (which is just wrong) and it was tough. The sardines came recommended but were disappointing. And the service was ridiculously fast. We were rushed through our dinner and out on the street in an hour. Not sure we will go back based on the whole experience.
5
We went to Blu Kouzina as a Belated Birthday Celebration Lunch for my fiancé; went on a Sunday afternoon and the place was packed to the brim with patrons and after tasting the food, I have to say it is rightfully so!We arrived 15 minutes earlier than the actual time of our Reservation but were very promptly seated upstairs on the second floor. I have to say the actual restaurant is actually a lot smaller than what it looks like or how it seems judging from the pictures on their website. That being said, it doesn't mean it is less charming or beautiful though! Felt as if we had been transported to a quaint little village in Santorini (although unfortunately I have never been to Santorini - cross fingers; hoping to go next year! - so I have to go with what I have seen in the pictures of Santorini. Whatever it is, the ambience of the place is amazing...) Adore the white-and-"Santorini Blue" colour scheme of the place, punctuated with the washed-out-vintage-feeling of various decor pieces; really added to the charm of this lovely restaurant. We ordered the Horiatiki Salata (Greek Salata with cucumber, cherry tomatoes, olives, onion, green peppers and Feta Cheese, drizzled with their family-owned Organic Extra Virgin Olive Oil) and although it was such a simple salad, it was so fresh and beautiful in all its simplicity. The cucumber cuts through the richness of the Feta Cheese and the sweetness of the cherry tomatoes balances everything out in perfect harmony.We also had the Meat Platter for 2 and it was so delicious! Those Lamb Chops were cooked to perfection; it was EXCELLENT AND TO DIE FOR! I can still taste it now as I am writing this review. I don't normally like to eat Lamb Chops too much because they tend to be very "fatty" but what we had today was just perfect! I have to admit I ate 3 out of 4 of those Lamb Chops as my fiancé was feeling really full (lucky for me!) after devouring the other meat items. My second favourite was the Bifteki, these beef patties were so juicy and succulent and full of flavour. The Kalamaki were also pretty good, tender and very easy to remove from the skewers. The only small criticism I had was I have to say those Keftedes (the small meatballs) were a little bit dry. But all in all, it was still an incredible Meat Galore Fiesta! We went with Mikhalis' recommendation on the wine, which was "strangely-light-on-the-palate" (and was just-perfect for lunch-time like he said) although it has a 14.5% A.B.V; Amethystos Rouge 2011 (can't remember the exact combination of grape varieties but it was delish) We also enjoyed Mikhalis' sense of humour and really appreciate the fact that he assured us how they can always change the wine if we didn't like it (as I was on the fence about which wine to choose) Last but not least, thank you Blu Kouzina for the complimentary Baklava, it provides the perfect ending to our wonderful meal and we will definitely be back soon! Can't wait to try all of the other items on the menu; the Psarika Anamikta a.k.a Seafood Platter with its Grilled Squid, Jumbo Prawns and Freshly-Imported Sea Bream look so inviting

Blu Kouzina was recommended to us by friends and we found it a great place with friendly service and lovely atmosphere. Also liked the Greek touches to the place to complement the food
4
Beautiful restaurant, relaxing and colorful, like a true Greek restaurant. Delicious food and good wine, service careful and kind. Reservation is recommended.
5
We've been there with a group, with our family, and by ourselves. Whenever we can get a table we go! Make sure to book well in advance and don't miss the desert! Best Greek food around.
5
If you're looking for authentic Greek food this is the place to go. I can honestly say that this is the best Greek food I gave had anywhere in the world!
Love the decor and service is excellent.
5
The food is great. .. The ambiance is awesome.. highly recommend this place.
We mostly ordered salads and really loved them.
4
Love this restaurant and we keep going back for more whether we visit as a couple, with family and friends. Service is genuine and served in the warmth of a typical greek family atmosphere. Food is beautiful and delicious wine. Reservations a must.
5
An amazing experience from start to finish. It's refreshing to find something different in Singapore, not only that it's done really really well. The service is superb as is the decor. You can tell this is a labour of love for people who have a deep passion for what they do. We started with wine and it was seriously delicious. Then came the food... Tasty, fresh, inspired dishes. I couldn't speak highly enough of the food and EVERYTHING was good.Prices were very decent! Per person we had 1 beer, half a bottle of wine and all the food we could possibly handle and it came to $90 each which, for the experience, I thought was a bargain.I will be back again and again
4
It's been a while since I felt so appreciated as a customer as I was during my dinner experience at Blu Kouzina. I felt cuddled from reservation confirmation, to complementary valet service, and all the way through to dessert and a shot of Greek Limoncello that goes down much easier than its Italian relative. The food definitely tasted authentic, but some dishes were more successful than others. Favorite dishes:Taramasalata, greek salad, moussaka, octopusLess successful:Spinakopita (lots of phylo, not so much spinach), souvlaki (medium was too dry), grilled feta (??? I was dreaming of haloumi), saganaki with figs (better to stick with pure, fig-less version)Wish I tried:Lamb chops, sardines, and calamar
4
The octopus was superb, the mezzo dips fabulous. Could not fault the food.Service was quick. The only very slight issue was the waiter who took our after dinner ouzo order may have got a little confused as we were served port instead but no buggy.Would highly recommend and we will definitely go back
5
We've been regulars at this lovely authentic Greek restaurant since it first opened its doors on Bukit Timah. Restaurant manager,George (from Santorini) and Chris do a fantastic job making sure everything flows efficiently even on the busiest nights. I can't really pick a favourite - everything is fantastic. The taramasalata and spanakopita are amazing; the lamb chops are beautifully tender and delicious. French fries are always a special treat. If there's a group of you, go for the mixed meat platter, which is great value and always superby tender. George will always recommend a good Greek wine choice, so worth experimenting based on his knowledge and your preferred style of wine. Service is always great, but it retains its relaxed casual appoach to make sure everyone feels welcome and chilled out
5
I must go to the Blu Kouzina during my annual visit to Singapore- third time now. And it seems to get better and better. We had a super meal there a few days ago, great wine and wonderful atmosphere.
5
Food here was excellent. We enjoyed the dinner with our family. Fish prawns Lobsters all were very good. When are in Singapore and like to try something different try this place.
5
As a person of Greek origin, the food here is just like homemade. This is where I come whenever I need to satisfy my childhood cravings.
4
We had a very nice greek meal, the best Octopus ever and all sort of other nice dishes from Greece, plus Greek wine.
Nice setting, very friendly staff and good service. Don't forget to finish your night with a zip Plomari.
4
Very friendly staff and a great atmosphere. There is a wide selection of authentic Greek food on the menu. Reasonably priced, fantastic food.
5
Blu Kouzina at its best yet again. Our meat dish arrived overcooked and they replaced it immediately no questions asked. When the new dish arrived, it was perfect. Yet another reason that keeps us coming back.
5
This restaurant has become so popular (evidence of how good its food is) that reservations for dinner on weekends have to be made 1-2 weeks in advance.Atmosphere is cosy/homely, and the service is good.The food is to die for! It's good to go in a group of 4 or more, so that you can get many dishes and share. Recommended dishes:- Imam Baildi- Dolmades- Moussaka- Feta Psiti- Spanakopitajust to name a few...A MUST try
5
If I crave Greek Food in Singapore, that is my go-to-place. A pity that the outdoor seating is now limited but it is still a nice place. I absolutely adore the rice with spinach dish but everything is good. A place to go for business, with good friends or as a couple
4
Been to Blu Kouzina a few times and decided to celebrate our 10-yr Anniversary here with a few friends!Everything we ordered was delicious-meatballs, Greek salad, spinach phylo , lamb chops, seafood platter(squid, sea bream, jumbo prawn), desserts & many bottles of red and white wine!!! Dining here takes me back to lively Mykonos but only thing missing is an ocean view..great dining experience
4
Nice place and great various food. the sardines and the octopus were really tasty.The staff if OK and the Manager without being omnipresent is taking very good care of the guest.the food is not only delicious (which is the most important) but the serving are big too.We haven't tried the wine but we will come back soon for a a other round of greek culinary delight.Cherry on the cake, as we were done and asking for the bill we were given a (free of charge) delicious set of dessert ... Highly recommended pace .
5
My second time at Blu Kouzina and it didn't disappoint. Once again all dishes we ordered were absolutely fantastic. This was even confirmed by our Greek guest. Some highlights were the dolmades, tzatziki, the Greek salad, the seafood platter including the sea bass and squid (grilled to perfection), fried zucchini and dessert platter. Friendly service and very flexible in terms of reservations (maybe we were lucky, cause I heard it's usually very full). Definitely one of my favorite eateries in Singapore these days
5
My wife & I had the pleasure of dining at this little establishment on a Saturday night. I must say we truly enjoyed the food and the services. Mikhalis was very attentive, helped us pick the wine (since we are not familiar with Greek wines) and the food service was super quick. All the items we ordered were impeccably fresh and the dessert was divine.Will be back soon again to try out the dishes we missed out on. Thank you
5
We'd heard good stories about this recent little Greek taverna on Bukit Timah Road and had the good reports verified for ourselves.Good selection of the classic Greek dishes, Lamb is our favourite. And the Wine List features quite a variety of Greek wines.On the whole, the prices are high but totally worth it
4
All the ingredients are fresh and tasted like they just came off from the farm or the sea today. I love the olive oil. They put a small bottle on every table. I pour a little on every dish that i had and it did wonders to the palette. It comes at a price though. But i am not complaining. See the pictures http://sgtalk.org/mybb/Thread-Lunch-1-fe

If you love Medditerannean food and fond of the Ottoman style "meyhane" dining you cannot find a better place in Singapore to satisfy your cravings. Greeks have been the undisputed culinary masters in the vast Ottoman Empire and the tradition continues today in Greek restaurants across the world where you can find the best meze platters rich with samplings of the many tasty finger foods from Eastern Mediterranean. From the many varieties of feta cheese starters to excellent fish and meat dishes, to have heavenly aubergines with pita and baklava varieties Blu Kouzina is "the Greek restaurant" in Singapore setting the standard. Whether a family night out, enjoying a dinner with friends or entertaining business associates, you are guaranteed to have great food and a pleasant evening at the Blu Kouzina with its relaxed and warm atmosphere and friendly staff. Giorgios and his army make you feel at home and at ease all night despite the buzzing multi-level location on Buket Timah. You might be tempted to drink wine as usual but if you have not done it already, you should try to do it the Greek way and have Ouzo with your meal. The flavors of Blu Kouzina get multiplied by the strong and sweet aniseed based "Lion's Milk". And finish off the night with a strong Greek/Turkish coffee while you enjoy your home-made baklava and you will go home full, very happy and pleasantly dizzy :-). Last but not the least all of that for a very reasonable price too...
4
We wanted to eat other than Asiatic or Italian, and BLU Kouzina is a good place to approach the Greek cuisine in Singapore. The suggested Yanakohori red wine was served at the right temperature (a performance considering the weather) and the general atmosphere is good. Make a reservation to have a chance to get a table
5
The place is a bit expensive but that applies for all good restaurants in Singapore. Lamb chops and beef teki were particularly good - feta psiti also worth mentioning - ambience was good. The owner made sure that we have a very good Greek dining experience
5
This restaurant is amazing! Delicious food, friendly staff and wonderful ambiance. It can be hard to make a reservation on the same day, as they are quite popular. Advance reservation is highly recommended. Be brave and try different dishes, they have been all very good so far
4
Blu Kouzina lives up to its reputation with excellent Service, and Great Fresh Grilled Seafood or Meat platter. This is one of the few culinary destinations in Singapore that is a must try for those yearning mediterranean cusine. The freindly and knowledgable staff will also make sure you order the right dishes and portions. Make sure to reserve in advance, otherwise risk waiting/ queuing outside in hot humid conditions. Parking could be challenging in the area but the Valet service right outside the restaurant solves it
5
There is very little to fault about Blu Kouzina. Our visit here started out with a simple question: "how many Greek restaurants are there in Singapore?" and our search online brought us here. The decor pays tribute to Greece and the food is simply stunning. Service was very professional and swift. All worth the price and the trip down
5
we enjoyed the food and the wine very much. The lamb was very tender and the grilled seafood was perfect.
5
Visited this restaurant for bf's birthday. Food and service was exceptionally good. The meat platter was amazing! One of the best place for Greek food in Singapore!
4
Arguably the best Greek food in this city. A bit out of the way, but that's part of its authentic charm. The tables outside are nice on breezy nights for groups of friends. Indoors upstairs has more 'romantic seating' if you're there on a date.
5
Absolutely love this place!!! The meat platter is amazing and there are a ton of vegetarian options!!! Win for me and my wife!
5
Having just moved to Singapore form the UK my wife and I were keen to find a good local restaurant - I think we've found a great local restaurant within walking distance of our apartment !What a great restaurant - great food, nice wines and brilliant staff. We had starters and then the Chicken cooked simply in the oven with lemon and potatoes - absolutely delicious !Looking forward to our next visit - word of warning, if you want to go to the restaurant at the weekend make sure you've booked. It's THAT popular and good 
5
Had a meal here with my family on Friday evening and it proved to be one of the best meals we've had in a long time. First of all, all of the waiters and staff were extremely friendly and willing to serve their guests. All of them came to check on us if the food was good, which certainly was a nice touch. And they frequently offered to replace our dirty plates as well as refill our water. Secondly, the theming of this place is exceptional. You do feel as though you aren't in the city anymore, but by a coast in the Mediterranean. The whole colour scheme and use of a variety of props such as seashells and rocks did add on to the overall experience. So now, we had an amazing first impression of the restaurant, but what about the deciding factor, the food? Well, that was the best part of the whole meal. I'm not in a really worthy position to critique on Greek food since I've never actually been to Greece, but from my experience, the food was all very fragrant and fresh. The food was served at an appropriate pace, such that we didn't feel rushed to finish our food or had to wait for a long time between dishes. Especially loved the lamb and the squid. Lamb was to die for and could even rival some steak houses. The dishes all infused a range of spices and flavours. That being said, though, the only part of the meal that didn't wow us was the desert. If you are not a fan of overly sweet deserts, then I wound't recommend many of the deserts. However, other than that, Blu Kouzina may perhaps be the best Greek restaurant in Singapore and maybe even one of the top restaurants in Singapore. Already waiting to go back to try more of their delicious food. Do not give this restaurant a miss! :
5
Came on 12th May to celebrate wifey's birthday as she was craving for some Greek salad and Blu Kuozina over delivered. Words fail me to describe our reaction after our very first bite, for the lack of a better term, I will say the food here is magical. Can't fail anything we ordered from the pita with cheese dip (forgot the name), feta psiti (grilled cheese), horiatiki (salad), and sea food platter with Sea Bass for main entrÃ©e. Unfortunately, we didn't have extra space for dessert! Big serving portion. If you love feta cheese and you're into gourmet type of food, this is the place to be. Must try! Customer service by the boss/owner and his team is top class. Will definitely come back here!My advice is to book in advanced, the place is packed even on week days.The place could be difficult to spot if you're unfamiliar with the area like we were.If you have no clue what to order, the boss will happy to offer some help
4
Good greek food and service. We went here for dinner on a Saturday night. Gets quite busy so you should probably book. The restaurant is tucked away on Bukit Timah Road and is easily missed if you do not know it is there. The staff are friendly and the food is good
5
We were looking for a nice restaurant to try in Bukit Timah area and tried this highly recommended restaurant in Tripadvisor. We are very pleased with our decision to go for Blu Kouzina.We loved all the food served to us! Realizing that we ordered same cheese ingredient for our salad and appetizer, the owner/manager recommended to us an alternative appetizer - fried cheese with honey and sesame - and it's superb! I think this is not in the menu but I suggest you ask for this
5
Was in Singapore on business for a couple of days and have been wanting to visit Blu Kouzina for a while after reading the reviews. The food was amazing that sums it up perfectly. Nice simple concept with great traditional Greek food. Portions are big service was good. I'd suggest book ahead as I did, when I arrived at 5.45 there was already a line up for the opening at 6pm we opted to sit outside as there was a nice breeze and looked more cozy. The GM was very friendly and chose a bootle of wine for us, also he helped served customers and made people feel welcome. The Dolmades were fresh as was everything and I ate the lot on my own, we then shared a wonderful Greek salad and a meet platter for 2 which we couldn't finish. It consisted of 4 lamb chops which were again amazing, 2 beef rissoles and 2 lamb meatballs , 2 huge skewers of beef. I will be telling all my friends who visit Singapore to try this place and I'll be back again for sure
5
Baklava is super delicious. Everything is excellent especially the spanakorizo - spinach herb rice. They use their own olive oil from their farm in Greece. It has a robust flavour. Try it!
5
Every year as a birthday treat we enjoy the delicious slabs of feta, stuffed peppers and souvlaki and never have we been disappointed. Terrific service and very satisfying. Please Always stay in Singapore.
5
In the U.S. we have a number of Greek restaurants to choose from, but I've never tasted anything better than Blue Kouzina. The setting is contemporary and comfortable. Our party of three sat upstairs. While the service was very good, it's the food that's the star. A broad menu features all types of seafood, lamb, beef and vegetables. My daughter lives in Singapore and it's one of her favorite spots
5
We have always been passing by Blu Kouzina and have been wanting to try it since they opened some time ago. We're staying not too far away from that. Finally, we decided to give it a go the day before and did not regret the choice at all.It's our first time trying Greek cuisine and honestly, the menu is of a pretty good selection, which means there's a lot to read since we didn't understand the names of the dishes at all. That's when the friendly manager/staff came into the picture! He made a few suggestions that we gave those a go. The process of selecting the wine was the same. We had such a good time, and the food are so delicious! So different from what we usually eat and it was a very enjoyable first experience. The owners were present, and also very warm and welcoming. One of them came to our table and checked the experience even. Kudos to that.There is one thing, you don't have to worry about over-ordering because the friendly staffs would advise you on that, if the items ordered will be too much for the party. I think that contributed a real lot to the whole dining experience too. We will definitely be back again
5
Amazing food. I'm greek and I'm expat for 9 years and I tried a lot of Greek restaurant... But always disappointed. I'm living in Kuala Lumpur, no good greek restaurant. So I decided to try Blu Kouzina. What a surprise! Owner very friendly, great food, olive oil, fish and other things are imported from Greece . The desserts are delicious baklava , bougatsa ... Do not miss it
5
We lived in Athens, Greece for three great years so our expectations were high. We were not disappointed. The manager, Giorgos?, was efficient and, well, Greek! The main chef was also Greek and it was clear they took pride in the food. I speak some Greek and it was great to hear the patter of the language during our meal. We had a wide variety of classic Greek dishes, malazaosalata, horiatikisalata, bifteki, paidokia, etc.. Some were perfect, others close, but by the end of the meal, my wife and I were extremely grateful we came. After living in Tokyo for the last three years, this was a real food treat that was not Asian. What a lovely food evening. Well done
5
I did not foresee getting my best Greek meal in Singapore but I could not be more wrong. Blu Kouzina is a must-go place in Singapore. It is situated in a very quiet area, so do not go there if you want to have a full evening of dinner and drinks. Go when you are craving a nice meal with family or your better half.Thank you for setting up shop in Singapore
5
Blu Kouzina Greek restaurant is very good with a helpful and friendly staff. Real Greek food in Singapore, yes! Being a visitor I really don't know what the Greek food options are in Singapore but I can't imagine a better Greek restaurant than Blu Kouzina. I originally come from Astoria in New York City which was like little Athens (may be little India now?) The Greek food in NYC was terrific and Blu Kouzina is just as good. They have a great menu, we shared, lamb chops, baked feta, eggplant, spanakopita, herring etc. All terrific. Baklava and a yogurt with fruit for dessert. They also have a very good list of Greek wines. A great choice you will enjoy the food
5
I ordered the roast chicken with potatoes, and it was absolutely bursting with flavor. The lemon and extra virgin olive oil are used to the fullest and make both the chicken and the potatoes taste delightfully full of zest and zip. I can honestly say it was the best-tasting chicken I've ever experienced. I also had the tzatziki, and it was wonderfully creamy and just as flavorful. The decor is homely and appropriately reflects the restaurant's Mediterranean roots. The atmosphere is perfect for gatherings with family and friends. The food is fantastic. I highly recommend it
4
The good was wonderful. We had: -Bougiourdi (red peppers stuffed with feta)-Mousaka (eggplant and minced beef lasagna)-Souvlaki me Pita (like a kebab but with beef steak and tzatziki)-Lentil soup (soup of the day) My boyfriend and I definitely felt the Mousaka and the Bougiourdi were the best of them all. Extremely tasty and good. The bread they give you is perfect. The olive oil really potent. We then ordered a Herbal Tea which we also highly recommend as it is served in a lovely metal pot for you to then pour with a filter into your mug. It is made with mountain tea leaves picked in Greece so a must try. When booking, make sure you ask for a table outside. Indoors (particularly downstairs) is just too crowded and a little stressful. We just felt pressured due to the overwhelming number of staff members near our table. Service as okay. Not the best ever but good enough for our liking.
5
I am Greek and I never eat Greek food outside Greece because 99% is not real Greek food. Surprisingly this restaurant offer REAL GREEK food but also very good and friendly service. WELL DONE for your try. For sure going back
5
The quality and taste off the food is great every time I come here. We asked staff to prepare us a mixed mezze starter and mains and we were not disappointed. We enjoyed a fantastic mix of dishes , some of which we had not sampled before. Now this option Is not on menu but no problem for staff handling this request. Standout was grilled halloumi starter. Desserts very sweet which is normal for greek/turkish cuisine
4
I wouldn't normally go Greek in Singapore, but sometimes you need a change of cuisine! So we find ourselves in the delightfully Mediterranean Blu Kouzina, next to an open window, no aircon. Our friends had been there before, so we started with a mixture of mezze: fava bean, tarama, (not sure that was home-made it was unnaturally pink) and aubergine dips hot cheese; and then followed it by an enormous fish platter. You might not think this is a good yardstick to judge Greek food, but a good fish platter is a signature dish of many Greek restaurants, and this was yummy - grilled squid, sea bream, and tiger prawn. The wine is all Greek, so beware, a bit resinated on the white and heavy on the red. But we finished off with some ouzo on the house which was a lovely touch. I will certainly go there again and try out some more dishes. Makes me homesick for Europe
4
Keep in mind, that if you are a vegetarian, getting good options in different cuisines (like specialist ones such as greek, argentian an the like) is not very easy..So who should go to this place? If you are a foodie who would like to treat yourself to the different cuisines Singapore has to offer, then this is a must do!Set in a small house on Bukit Timah, the restaurant is very vertical and spread over 3 floors I believe..This is the only Greek Restaurant that I would recommend in this country. We ordered theFava Bean Dip - Good. Worth OrderingSome Red Dip (yogurtish) - Average. Wouldn't order againBougiourdi - Red Peppers stuffed with Feta - GoodPIta Bread - GreatFrench Fries - GreatThe Spinach RiceThe Three Bean Salad (Fasolisakata) - FantasticGreek Salad - Great too!Imam Baildi (Eggplant with Tomato Sauce! Fantastic)And Spinach Rice (Spanakorizo) - Good. But can skipAnd Baklava - nice!Greek Coffee - We ordered, but they took too much time and we had a movie to catch, so we cancelled. It looked good on the neighbours table!Service _ Awesome!Ambience - Quaint and nicePortion Size - Big , so order accordinglyFood can be a bit oily, but it is healthy olive oil. However, if I were to go again, I would ask for a bit less oil in some dishes.Have fun
5
Fabulous from the moment you reserve a table to the moment you have to leave replete. Easily Top 5% service in Singapore and easily best Greek restaurant on the island. Not just best Greek restaurant I would go further and say Top 5 restaurant experience we've had in Singapore overall. Our lead waiter chose a lot of the dishes for us based on what was fresh in on the day and his recommendations were highly validated. Meze starters had proper pita bread (difficult to get in Singapore) and the freshest homemade hummus, tsatziki, taramasalata, etc. on a table of 8 we also had one fish dish and one meat dish. Both were exceptional. We had complimentary ouzo and a complimentary desert - both well received. Wine was well priced but decent Greek wine that complimented the food perfectly. Go for the food and you'll go back for the experience!
5
this restaurant make me write my first review! amazing authentic greek food with many bbq selections ( greek style) that you will be amazed when you try them! a must try for bbq (fish or meat) lovers! the restaurant is packed even in weekdays.......so reservation better be made!! service efficient and friendly
4
I have been there 3-4 times. Blu kouzina is a restaurant with very good authentic greek food. Some of the ingredients are coming all the way from Greece like feta cheese and olive oil. Service is excellent and managers always very polite and helpful. It must be the only place in Singapore that serves greek wine. 2 pax dinner with 2-3 starters 2 main and a bottle of red wine would be around SGD200 - 250. Cannot be considered cheap but is definately much better than other international cuisine restaurants which charge the same price and food is simply not eatable. If i have to mention something that i dont like that is the location. Is far from most commercial areas of Sg so not convenient to visit. Due to quality food its packed even the weekdays so always book before your visit
4
The Greek food here is really good! The place has 3 floors with the upper two having aircon. We chose to be seated outside as it was windy and it was great! Could get a bit noisy outside as the place is located right next to the road.I had the lamb chops for main course and it was brilliant. For starters, I had their fries and trust me they were one of the best I had one in Singapore! Definitely a must try. And since you are at a Greek Restaurant, make sure to top it off with a Baklava. At the end, it wasn't expensive and with the ambience, it is definitely a value for menu!Kudos to the staff who are courteous to explain the dishes and menu before hand :
4
Good food, not spectacular but very good simple Greek fares . Owner / Maitre d ..very authentic, nice guy a bit rough on the edges, but gave us some good recommendation for the wine ( good Chardonnay ) and served us additional drinks " on the house " at the end. NB the grilled seafood platter is huge and very fresh.Will definitely good back
4
I went to Blu Kouzina for the first time 3 years ago and was not impressed with their food or the service. Being half Greek, you tend to know what is good and what is not. However over the last couple of years I have been going more and more and this restaurant has really transformed itself into an exceptional Greek dining experience. Every time I go, the food and whole dining experience seems to be better than the last time! I took 5 friends there for dinner last week and the quality of the food was very, very good. It is also not expensive, I believe its also one of the better 'value for money' restaurants now in Singapore. If you want authentic Greek food, do not miss this restaurant but book early they tend to fill up quickly......it appears a lot of people feel the same way
5
The Greek salad was the best ever! The food was delicious, the service excellent and the ambiance delightful. Who would have imagined a find like Blu in Singapore!
5
Had dinner today at Blu Kouzina. The food is very, very good. The food is wholesome, the portions large, the service, friendly. Enjoyed every course, from starters to desserts. I'm definitely going back!
4
We decided to try some Greek food for a change and picked Blu Kouzina. We were told the next table available would be at abt 9pm. The restaurant had the ground floor and further 2 floors of dining area. The place was bustling packed with happy diners. It was cozy with blue and white walls. Although what appears to be a shortage of waiting staff but we were served rather quickly in placing orders and drinks. We ordered the Greek Salad the serving is generous with a tablet of feta cheese), grilled fresh sardines with olive oil and lemon, pita filled beef kebab, accompanied with Greek beer, so light and refreshing. Finally we ordered hot filo pastry with semolina cream for dessert, but we needed to cancel becos of another appt at 1030pm. The dessert was prepared but the manager was flexible to cancel it and made it complimentary for us!! (Thats really service, like that in New York! - we gave a 4%tip). Had a bite of the dessert it was soft,lightly crispy and hot. Thks for preparing a great meal. Am sure thats how it is in Greece. Watch out for us, we'll be back
4
After hearing constant rave reviews about this restaurant, finally decided to check it out good friends from the UK. Set up like a lovely Greek home, we were recommended to try their octopus which was really really fresh & tasty! Though out beef in wrap that I ordered wasn't that wow. The owner of the restaurant did a good job walking around interacting with his diners!
4
This was my first visit to Blue Kouzina, a very authentically designed Greek restaurant, even the staff seem Greek/Mediterranean. It is on the outskirts of the city and you will need to either drive or take a taxi there. We parked behind the restaurant where there are a few spaces.We were a group of 5, and whilst everyone else did enjoy their dish I was disappointed with mine. I had wanted to order the chicken however was advised against it by the waiter and told that the beef patties (more expensive by a few dollars) was better, so I took his advice. The beef was rather crumbly and wasn't sticking together, there was little else to the dish apart from a few small bits of potato, and 2 slices of tomato. It was flavoursome, but not tasty and I didn't enjoy the texture.I also tried the greek salad, which was delicious. The staff were attentive and friendly, and there was a good atmosphere in the restaurant (might be to loud for some, I often couldn't hear the person on the other side of the table). I would return, however next time would make my own decision regarding the dish I chose and not listen to the staff suggestion
4
The smoked eggplant dip was excellent, as were the pita bread, moussaka and bifteki. As a crazed fan of white taramasalata, I was a little disappointed with what was served that day - I thought it was a little stingy on the roe. Maybe it was just a substandard batch, as I recall it being very good the last time I had it there two years ago. All in all, my dinner companion and I were very satisfied with our meal
5
This was my first visit to Blu Kouzina and I will be back again. The food, service and ambience was fantastic. Every dish we ordered was delicious and full of the authentic Greek flavors that I love. Their Greek wine was great and well priced as well. Will add to my list of regular restaurants
5
Although a little outside the center of the city, it is worth the drive! The food there is really very good and very authentic. There is a relaxed and good atmosphere in the restaurant and for Singapore good value for money! Portions are on the larger side. Great place to get some dishes to share. The service there is kind and attentive. Can recommend this restaurant! And many great choices for kids as well

Blu Kouzina is, by far, my favorite restaurant in Singapore. I may be a little biased because I absolutely love Greek food, but this place serves some of the best Greek food I've ever eaten (even in restaurants in Greece)! The staff is excellent, and mainly Greek! They are always ready to help with a suggestion, or to just fill your water up. The meals are out of this world. The moussaka is fluffy and delicious, the keftedes are meaty and juicy and the galaktoboureko is creamy and dripping with honey. Everything about the place is amazing. The decor is very "Greek islands," with a television showing a cycle of photos of Greece. If you like Greek food, or just want some really delicious food, you must go here. I plan to spend all my special occasions eating Greek
5
"Wow!" That's what was coming out of my mouth in between bites of some amazing Greek dishes. We've been a few times and it just gets better. The service is warm, welcoming and attentive. Perfect compliment to the AMAZING food!Restaurants are really either hit or miss in Singapore (unfortunately) and this place is unquestionably a hit. Even if it's a bit out of the way...it's definitely worth it!!
5
Liked this restaurant, was like a bit of Greece has been transplanted in Singapore.
The food was great quality and the service was good with traditional Greek warmth.
You can't go wrong with this Restaurant.
5
I eat quite often at Blu Kouzina. The food is amazing and the service is excellent. I am glad I stumbled upon this cute restaurant in the heart of Bukit Timah. Whether you want to go vegetarian or are a meat lover this is a place for you! It's also perfect for date night or just a night out with your friends. It is a bit pricey but what isn't expensive in Singapore? At least you get more for your money.

We had to book on Monday to get an earliest 2030 table for 8 on the following Saturday night, such is the popularity of this place. The others had been before but this was our first visit and we were not disappointed. The dips were sensational (as any greek can do!) and our group of 8 ordered the platter of meat FOR 4 and it FED 8!! with some left over. The service was pleasant and responsive to our needs. we will be back, that is for sure!! We did not have room for desserts or coffee; but am sure they would not have disappointed
5
If you're looking for great Greek food with fabulous service then look no further.The menu is varied, the food is fresh and very good quality. The staff were extremely helpful in advising on portion size and suggested some great choices. The portion sizes are large. It is quite expensive we thought but worth every penny.We will definitely go back
4
We enjoyed our meal and will definitely go back! Service was great. I am pregnant and asked about what food I could have and surprisingly the male waiter knew exactly how to address all my concerns. Love the decor too. I really enjoy this restaurant every time I visit. 
4
really enjoyed the lunch I had. The food was amazing - order a grill platter which was delicious. The steaks were so tender and juicy. The greek salad was outstanding too.Location was great as it was a little out of the city. Quiet and lush.Highly recommended
5
Even though the indoor is quite nosy it brings you even more to the south of Europe atmosphere!The staff is very fast and helpful, while the food is very good. I have to say the portions are HUGE so keep it calm on the appetizers otherwise you will not be able to finish your main dish! We even got offered a glass of Limoncello! Definitely one of the treasure of Bukit Timah ;
5
Probably one of our favourite restaurants in Singapore at the moment - we've been twice with two different couples and had a fantastic meal both times. The taramasalata is fantastic and the grilled octopus is some of the best I've ever had - the greek salad was a good size and well executed and the other dishes were all very tasty and of a decent size. The restaurant regularly has specials which are worth trying, including a rabbit stew which was yummy - they also have a good wine list focused on mainly Greek wines which are very good and reasonably priced.Staff are very friendly and attentive and the dÃ©cor for the mid-level room makes you feel like you're on the Med rather than in Asia. There are a lot of stairs (shop house style restaurant) but the climb is worth it
4
This restaurant is recommend by my colleague who is a Greece and the food is yummy. Order both platter and the seafood platter is damn good. I totally love the fish. Meat platter is good too but i cant get the seafood out of my mind. There are a few other dish that my friend ordered but cant remember what they are but i dont think there is a dish that they order i didnt like
4
Was invited by friends to dinner here. Was initially a bit hesitant as I am not a fan of European food. To my surprise, the food was actually GOOD here. Wide variety of meat dishes balanced with vegetables and actually tasty. Ambiance and service is also good here; so will definitely return with family soon
4
Great value and good food in nice ambiance. We were there with a group and we were satisfied with food and service.
4
Perfect Sea Bream. Perfect greek wines. And a friendly hard-working host !
This is the place to go to at 8 and stay till closing.
5
Good service, excellent food, cosy environment.
No dressing up required, very comfortable.
Will definitely go again.
4
Have been here a few times and the food is always delicious! Staff are friendly and helpful. Decor is cute too!
4
We were told it is good so we went there with a high expectation. It was proven right. The food was so delicious, beyond world. What's more, Greek diet is vegetarian friendly!
5
Really charming restaurant, and the food was fresh and delicious.
Staff were extremely efficient and friendly.
The Fava, salad, squid were amazing- haven't eaten such fresh squid in Singapore before!
We will be going back regularly!
5
Best Greek food I've had East of the Med. If you're a fan of greek food or just want to try it out, don't hesitate. Good service, robust and fresh ingredients, casual taverna setting, lovely decor. The only minor gripe I'd have is that we ordered the apples with cinnamon and honey, thought there could've been more of both. But really, that's nitpicking.Just go
1
Went here because of its rating and recommendations.. But it was really disappointing.First of all, bad service and the staff looks tatty and really not dressed appropriately (for example one was wearing a soccer short). Waited extremely long for our appetizer and main course which then came both at the same time. The food was overly salted and not delicious. Would have had a better meal if cooked myself at home.. Additionally, They charged us for a bread we haven't requested and have been told it was their homes bread.Will definitively not come here again
5
Came here for lunch last Friday with a couple of biusiness friends. It's a bit far from the CBD but we had been planning a visit for ages. We were certainly not disappointed - the food is wonderful, even the taramasalata is excellent, the flat bread has that lovely smoky grilled flavour to it, quite honestly we could have eaten every single dish on the menu! Will definitely be back soon
5
Fantastic experience. A beautiful traditional Greek taverna with authentic Greek dishes hidden away in Bukit Timah. It is worth visiting. The easiest way to get there is by taxi. The portions are very good and the taste reminds me of holidays spent in Greece. Reservations are necessary especially over weekends. The service is excellent and the manager is a true gentleman
5
This is just a fantastic place to go for an evening out with family or friends -we found the quality of ingredients absolute ly exceptional, with food designed for sharing slowly over a glass of wine or more.
4
Enjoyed our family dinner here very much. The spanakopita with phyllo pastry was a standout as was the moussaka. Also liked the Greek salad topped with a generous block of feta cheese. Vegetarian options available as well and portions were decent. The only dish we weren't sure about was the roast chicken with lemon which we felt was a little too sour (but may have just been the style of the dish). Overall, good service, great atmosphere, authentic food. Would go back again
5
I choose Blu as the place to celebrate my husband's birthday cuz we are Greek food lovers and it looks like a cozy, romantic and unique place to be in Singapore. We ordered Saganaki with Figs, pita with Tzatziki as starters, Mousaka and Gemista as main courses. The manager told us we seemed to have ordered a lot and yes we over-ordered. The portions are big and the food is filling. The taste was superb though. Service was wonderful too. We would definitely go back sometime soon! Perfect experience!
5
First of all, you might wanna reserve a table before you go because this place is packed! And for good reason too! It is a bit pricey but it's worth it, everything tastes so delicious and mouth-watering! A Greek friend of mine suggested I try tzatziki and spanakopita, which are absolutely delicious so I highly recommend that. The olive oil they use is homegrown in the owner's family farm in Greece and they are for sale as well, if you want! The service has always been on point, the owners makes an effort to know all their customers. I love the whole theme too! Very Mediterranean, blues and whites!
4
This was our second time dining at Blu Kouzina, and like the first experience, we really enjoyed the food. This time, however, there were some exceptions. When seated, the waiter brought over some bread (which they charge you for by the way!), and this was cold and stale as another reviewer noted. Would be better not to serve this at all or else let people know that it is not complimentary!! We had the meatballs and tzatziki for starters, and the portion of pita bread we ordered was also served cold and when I complained, our second portion was served warm. There were four of us dining and one portion of pita bread was just four small pieces and I wish the waitress had let us know this in the beginning so we could have saved some time and ordered extra at once. This was a problem only because getting the wait staffâ€™s attention was quite a challenge as the restaurant was busy. However, when we did get service they were very pleasant and knowledgeable. The Greek wine which was recommended was very nice and so were our mains of the meat platter, moussaka and bean salad. Note: the meat platter for 2 was a very generous portion, and quite enough for four to share with some side dishes. Baklava for dessert was also nice and it comes as a serving of three generous pieces, but could do with some ice cream on the side to make it a more complete dish. Would go back again because the quality and taste are superb, but some issues like the cold bread and rushed service need to be addressed.
5
from the moment you enter Blu, you are transported to to a greek island. the restaurant is run by his owner , Greek and in the open kitchen you see the preparation.Service is very friendly. you must try the grilled sardines. a bit of olive oil and salt on top and it is the best ever eaten in Singapore. the other dishes are all good. Order , family style, and share with your guests.  great for parties. I did my birthday there. will be back for sure
5
As a Greek American who has experience moms cooking, the great Greek restaurants in NYC and Greece itself on many occasions I can say I absolutely loved it. I spent 3 weeks in Greece this summer and couldn't find Yemista. Well thanks to this jewel I did!!! Thanks Christo and staff for a great stay.
5
I can't name many restaurants in Greece itself where good fava bean paste is served... The expereince is Greek indeed as you can get an Ouzeri feel by sitting outside on the pavement or an island feel by sitting inside. Attention to detail is great as coffee is served in a "Kefeneio" style tray... And the fooooooodddddd... No comment as my Greek mama (who is the best cook in the world) can't cook to Blu Kouzina standards... Well Done
5
This is a really great restaurant. The setting is low-key but cool and the staff are super. On to the outstanding food - the best Greek food I have ever eaten anywhere in the world (including Greece). We enjoyed it tremendously and judging by how full it was on a Wednesday night we were not alone. Last but not least, Greek wine has come a long way since I last drank it - the Hatzimichalis Cabernet Sauvignon was world-class :-
3
My boyfriend and I decided to come to this restaurant purely due to the fantastic reviews on here but were left disappointed unfortunately.Booked weeks ago but were given a table on the pavement area (not even in the restaurant) overlooking the main road, 'Avis' car hire shop and a supermarket with people carrying shopping bags through the walk way directly through the area we were sat all evening! Not what you expect from the prices!We asked If we could move inside as they have two stories and the waiter said no they are fulling booked so we accepted. Then they had more and more people turn up for dinner, some who did not have reservations and they were all greeted and taken to tables INSIDE where the decoration looked lovely with a fab Greek atmosphere and music, so it seemed a little bad practice. The Greek salad was, however, delicious and our main meals were very tasty. Extremely oily I might add, but very good, especially the lamb chops and beef souvlaki. I would recommend these dishes, as many other reviews on here do.We shared baklava for desert, which was quite nice but needed some ice cream or something to counteract the acute sweetness.When we got the bill, which took about ten minutes as no one came over regardless of eye contact, waving etc we noticed the bread they brought over at the start was charged at $5 for a tiny piece of stale bread! And the water cost $11! Bit cheeky. They did give out free shots at the end which was a nice touch though.All in all I was left feeling a little sad we had trecked quite far to try this place out and then not really experienced the proper evening there, as I'm sure it could have been completely different. Doubt we will return
5
Great Mediterranean atmosphere, and authentic Greek food and outstanding service. I am looking forward to visit this restaurant again on my next day off, I should try all the meal from the menu. Lovely!!
5
Me and four of my friends have been in Singapore for two weeks, visiting every day different world cusines, but this is by far the best place to visit! All of us agree on that!
4
In spite of a terrible location (with impossible parking), this small restaurant usually draws a full house because the food is very good. The dips are scrumptious, the salads fresh, and the meat dishes flavourful. Good selection of Greek wines - and they serve a mean ouzo. Attentive and efficient service. Prices are on the high side, but the experience is pleasant, so you won't feel cheated. Kukurrukuku Kouzina
5
This place is superb. It's been really well thought through as a restaurant. The decoration is great and I loved the English to Greek translation lessons in the bathroom. Service was excellent and the food is to die for. I love Greek food and this was as good as I get in Greece. Excellent ambiance and can't fault it
5
I decided to give Blu Kozina a visit after a friend recommended it. The Bukit Timah location is not convenient for me but I was glad I made the trip. The operations manager Christos seated me & was helpful in making recommendations. I really wanted to eat everything on the menu but opted for taramaslata with pita bread for a starter. It was creamy with the salty tang of the fish roe & paired beautifully with the grilled pita bread. The main was the reason I came - grilled sea bream, the whole fish which tasted like you were seated in an outdoor restaurant somewhere in the Aegean! It came with a potato salad & some vegetables which complimented the freshness of the fish beautifully. Christos & his crew were attentive & he even gave me a complimentary dessert of Greek yogurt topped with walnuts & honey. Refreshing & just right. I intend to return with friends & order other items on the menu. It really felt like Greece right in your own backyard
4
The food is as authentic Greek as is the management. All of the starters and main courses are excellent,both meat and fish. Once indoors it feels like being on an island in Greece too. We usually order a whole bunch of starters and main course platters to share. The wine from Santorini is worth a try and for the adventurous try the Retsina.
5
Being German I have eaten a lot of Greek food and must say the food at Blu Kouzina is outstanding. You could forget that you are in Singapore and escape for an evening to Greece. The food is so fresh and tasty, we just didn't want to stop eating. The Greek salad is a must followed by the grilled octopus. If you are a cheese lover, you need to try their pan fried cheeses...to die for. If you a meat lover you go for the meat platter or dive into all the delicious fresh seafood. All rounded up by great Greek desert and as the manager is Greek, the service is warm and friendly. Go and try it, it is amazing
5
I saw the reviews on Tripadvisor and could not believe my luck as the restaurant is only around the corner. I tried it this evening and asked George to recommend my dinner, the vine leaves were fabulous, served with a light mint yoghurt. To follow I had sea bream which was just perfect chargrilled yet soft and milky flesh that came off the bone easily. Served with roast peppers, courgettes and potatoes. I even had the house Greek White wine, which I have to say was just right. The atmosphere is friendly, with families groups and couples this fun vibrant restaurant is a real gem
5
I choped 3 seats in advance for my friend's birthday lunch celebration. I was impressed that we had seat reserved on the second level with the window view. The waitress & waiter recommended excellent choices of main courses, including lamb chop, sea bass and chicken (in this order). We reached at 1.30pm and we stayed all the way till 5.30pm. Although the kitchen closes for lunch orders at 2.30pm, you can still order coffee and drinks to stay on longer for the afternoon, which was what we did. The decor and the ambience brings you away to Greece, which is lovely to say the least. Had an awesome time and would definitely go back again!
5
excellent CUISINE! hardly to be matched even in Greece!!!! all of it was "GREECE AT IT'S BEST"...combining,"genuine greek-island style decor,food,cleanleness,hospitality and quality of products..even wines are "imports of greece"!good quality in combination with price and service excellence!an real "EYE OPENER"...for Greeks!also..ought to know that such restaurants! are a "front-line advertisement for Greece and it's products! MUST BE SUPPORTED. Bravo!!
5
We stumbled upon Blu while walking one night our 1st week in Singapore. We've returned several times and each time the food is amazing. The staff are attentive and efficient. The decor and atmosphere is comfortable and suitably Greek!
5
Do not miss this authentic, super delicious Greek restaurant. The lamb is phenomenal. Hospitality is at Greek best standards. The atmosphere is cozy and makes you feel at home. Love it!
5
The most authentic Greek restaurant in Singapore. Portions are hearty, the staff is very friendly, service is speedy but not rushed, and the decor and ambience is perfectly Greek. If you drop by, try their Octopus - it's to die for.
4
We went for dinner on a Sunday and liked the place for its rustic decor, cuisine for the taste as well as wholesome portions,warmth and efficiency of service.
4
We have our share of good Greek restaurants in Sydney but this beats them all.Musts are the Greek salad and moussaka and the octopus. All good honest homely Greek food. Fresh ingredients and attention to detail. Service is exceptional.A bit out of the way but worth it if you need to get a fix of good Greek food in Singapore.
5
Once we entered Blu Kouzina, we found ourselves in the middle of the Mediterranean. Everything was authentic Greek, from the owners to the sea salt on the table. The service was excellent, our waiter explained all the choices on the menu and was attentive throughout the evening. We went as a large group of friends and ended up letting George, the restaurant Manager, serve us a range of his recommendations, which was totally perfect! From the pita bread to the feta cheese, the portions were very generous and we certainly didn’t leave hungry. On top of that, the wines are extremely reasonably priced. We were reminded of a Greek restaurant we used to visit on our holidays in Santorini- it’s that authentic
5
We had a lovely visit to Blu Kouzina again. They seem to be going from strength to strength. This time we tried the Saganaki with fig preserves. This dish is a special Greek cheese that is fried, It was so good, and the first time I've had it with the fig preserves. That was a great addition. There were big chunks of fig, just like you would make at home. I had the beef souvlaki, it was delicious, although I do prefer the chicken (Just my personal taste) Hubby had the meatballs on tomato with the roast potatoes. Yummmmmm-Ohhhhhh! Tender, tasty, so good. The fries for my souvlaki were so hot out of the fryer, hubby stung his tongue! You always get hot food at Blu - no luke warm reception hereEvery meal I have here is the best meal I've had her
5
Absolutely loved this place and can't wait to get back there. The restaurant is gorgeous. It has a Greek look to everything and the attention to detail including audio of Greek speaking lessons in the bathrooms is well thought out. The service was incredible. Our knowledge of Greek wines is poor so when we ended up with a wine we didn't like so much he helped us work out what we were after and then selected the perfect wine for what we were after. The food was divine and the choices were great. We look forward to going back and trying all the other on the menu that sounded delicious. I highly recommend this restauran
5
Despite the location (bit out of town), we like going this cozy charming restaurant. Usually go there on weekend like Sunday afternoon. The restaurant owner who is very passionate like an ambassador of the Greek! use to be there but not any more... probably he is too busy with other work. We enjoy the food and friendly service. Saganaki (greek cheese) with figs, grilled sea bass and Greek Yogurt, MUST try items
5
We went there for dinner. Owners were there, very friendly and welcoming. Plenty of choice, and the portions are a good size. Their tzatziki is excellent. The place is in an area which doesn't have much appeal but the owners have managed to make the restaurant look warm and welcoming, with a bit of a Greek island atmosphere, so props to them for achieving that. Definitely recommend if you want to have some great Greek food in Singapore
5
Easily the best Greek food in Singapore. A little out of the way if you are central, but worth the taxi fare. Friendly service and warm atmosphere.
5
My first time having a Greek meal and I have to admit its great, everything is great. I will have to come back for more. The service is great too, its known to be crowded and full everyday so please book in advance.
5
Each time we come at Blue is like the fist time! Mezze's just perfect! Fresh gambas et fish! Wine with good quality price rate! Keep some place for desert! And even if you don't have more place, your stomach with find and do the rest!! Go go go
5
My husband, being the French that he is, was quite apprehensive about going for Greek food that evening. I had already been there once and was very keen on him trying. We were a group of 5 adults and 2 small and annoying children. Not only were the staff patient with my kids, they were keen to explain the menu and the origins of their key ingredients. With many imported from Greece herself (including the fish! Yeah right??!). Every single item we had was outstanding, with such great taste and generous portions for the mains. With Greeks running the floor and the kitchen, we had such a lovely evening - good authentic Greek cuisine and, friendly and cosy atmosphere - all bound to ensure a wonderful experience. By the end of the evening, my husband was already asking when we can go again.
5
Blu has a gorgeous setting, delicious food and really helpful staff. A rare gem to find all three. The food was fresh and delicious. I recommend the octopus that was cooked to perfection and the smoked eggplant. Yum. decor is lovely and the restaurant is charming and relaxed, as are the staff. Desserts were great too - the apple was the standout. We had a great night at Blu. Will be back
4
Fantastic! Small little place - so cozy.. you can hear Greek being spoken every so often.. really feels like you've left Singapore and are dining in some little Greek cafÃ© in Athens.. Great food.. Definitely will be one of my regulars places to go eat at.
5
We stayed 10 nights in Singapore recently. Being married to a Greek, I am very fond of anything Greek related. So when we travelled to Singapore from Australia I was on a mission to find a Greek Restaurant. How great was it when I called to make a reservation when I spoke Greek to the owner, I could feel his warmth over the phone. The food itself was great, very tasty and very authentic. Try the keftedes (meatballs) just as good as my mother in-laws. And the Souvlakia with Pita bread was just as good as the ones in Greece. It took just 10min by Taxi from Clarke Quay - well worth the trip there. We thoroughly enjoyed it... Bravo sas !!
5
This is a great hidden gem in Singapore. The food is as authentic as Greek food can be in Singapore. Good olive oil, quality ingredients, welcoming owners. The service is great, though it might slow during peak hours of the weekend. Booking in advance is recommended
5
Not usually too impressed by most restaurants, this perfect Greek gem was fantastic. The charming atmosphere, wait staff and cuisine was a amazing combination. Didn't need their menu because a young and well informed Greek waiter offered a perfect selection of appetizers, wine and mains. What a nice evening, Thanks!!!
5
Outstanding! A return visit to Blu Kouzina showed an actual improvement. The food remains as fresh as ever, despite a lot of the ingredients possibly coming from Greece for a real authentic touch. Discovered a couple of great appetisers that I highly recommend to you: Bougiourdi (spicy feta cheese, grilled - a bit like haloumi) in red bell peppers, and Spanakopita (a spinach pie in filo pastry). Kotopoulo yiro (more commonly known as chicken giros) was outstanding too, with a nice garlicky yogurt sauce
5
Great place and one of my favourites. The food is excellent with emphasis on well executive grilled meats and fish, as well as salads and great cheese dishes! Highly recommend trying the appetisers and sharing the mixed grills! Good and affordable wine list too.
4
Good food, small and cosy restaurant. Friendly staff with exotic accent. Although the food is rather expensive for students nevertheless it was a really pleasant dinning experience for me
5
I have visited Blu Kouzina on today ,the restaurant cozy & white Blu , the staff are very friendly once we arrived at restaurant we order some Greek drinks apsa bio this appetite very well than we order spinach pie and 3 deep platter with pita very testy , the bean soup amazing . For the main main we order chicken yiro & lamb chop med well wow wow wow we will visit again this place 
4
When u step into the restaurant, it's an oasis of blue and country charm. This appeals to a busy executive like me seeking a refuge ! The busy kitchen with chefs spouting Greek ( I suppose so, maybe not?) is atypical of a busy grandma country kitchen. Love that good mix of calm and din.Ithis little hideout can be easily missed but once u are at the front door, it seems to want to feed u well. And yes it did!!We went for all that the manager recommended - the Greek salad which was a generous scrumptious plate of crunchy freshness topped with a generous slab of feta and sprinkling olives. This brought the dish to a perfect 10. Beef kebab wrap was a stunner, pink juicy chunky beef is delicious and sexy! Gosh it's good to feel carnivorous.oh if u could- skip the fires accompaniment . It's soggy. And that's a slight downer.We ended the dinner with a healthy dessert- which is basically green apples with cinnamon and fig honey - hey this is healthy and cream free and helps takes away the guilty indulgence of the evening . The sweet ending was a complimentary shot of lemoncello from the friendly but not overly intrusive manager :) well done and u got a returning customer on your list
5
We went to Blu Kouzina for the first time last night. We were with a group of friends so we shared a few staters, mains and desserts. Starters and desserts were excellent. The mains were good. Food came in a timely fashion and we felt super at home. It really made us remember our holidays in Greece.
5
Pretty n Lovely Greek Restaurant along Bukit Timah Road. Great food and ambiance n friendly boos and staff ! Thumbs up ! Lovely deco and bet you won't feel out of place thinking you are somewhere in Greece...heeeGotta say, it's a "must try" restaurant !Just a tot....those with small children may find the space a tad tight... juz my opinion.....For those who drive, best to turn into Maple Ave, (about 100M before the restaurant) and immediately turn right into Cherry Ave. Try your luck along this road as very few lots available. Else, at the end, turn left into Elm Ave n should have lots available here. If you missed the very 1st turn (Maple Ave), fret not. Further pass the restaurant, you can still make a left and look for parking lots along Old Holland Road. Happy hunting for your parking lot !As usual, just sharing n hope it helps.....cheers 
5
We went there for dinner and ordered 2 starters, 2 mains, and 1 dessert to share between the two of us.All the items were excellent. The fried goat cheese and the beef skewer were our favorites. Even my wife, who is generally not a fan of mediterrenean cuisine, agreed! But we were completely stuffed afterwards...Food service was very fast, with dishes arriving quickly and just when we were ready for the next one.The restaurant also took note of the fact that is was my birthday and offered a complimentary "birthday baklava", which was a very nice gesture.The manager welcomed us, came by to check on us during the meal, and said goodbye with a handshake too
5
My family loves good food.. We have visited Blu's twice.. we have been very happy both times..meat platter is great along with their Talagani (Goat cheese with their special sauce) & Dolmadas Gialatzi ( Vine leaves stuffed with rice). Also their lentil soup is great. Heard from some Greek friends that it can't get any more "Greeky" than here. Service is great...Also if they miss your call, they callback to help you with reservation :
5
I've been here with my family to just treat kids to a nice meal. I'm glad my friend recommended me this place. Its a cozy place with such tastefully done greek setting. Airy and wellVentilated. The chef cum owner takes the order. The team of new bright staff serves you! We went by his recommendations and enjoyed the meal! A bit pricy but fully justified!!!
4
This is an excellent restaurant - the food is fresh, well prepared, and absolutely authentic. Wine list is excellent and very appropriate - added bonus - Greek wines have little reputation here and can be had at very reasonable prices making the list a great treasure trove of excellent choices.A couple of points to improve - service can be slow and George could smile a little more once in a while... overall, excellent place despite the rather dreary location on Bukit Timah
4
Great selection of authentic Greek food, perfect for sharing plates. Nice ambiance and the staff were very pleasant. Will definitely return!
5
Blu Kouzina is a rare Greek restaurant in Singapore. It serves everything fresh, importing their own seafood and even olive oil which goes really well with their wonderful bread.As it is located along Bukit Timah Road, it has limited parking facilities, but free valet services is provided. Very efficient and quick service. That's the reason that this restaurant is able to cater for 2 seatings per session. So, when you book, you have to decide on the seating you want. This does not go well for some diners who wish to have a more relax dining experience or for a special occasion.My favourite is their grilled whole sea-bass, a fish that I avoid. Another dish that impressed me is grilled lamb rack. Their appetisers and salad are also wonderfully cooked and fresh.I've been there 3 times. I'll be there again
4
Terrific authentic Greek food, terrific service and reasonable value.Generous slabs of lovely feta cheese, all the dishes swim in real Greek olive oil, great taste combinations. It isn't cheap but the cooking is great. A suggestion, try not to seat couples next to families with babies, takes away from the ambience and the enjoyment of a meal trying to have a conversation next to screaming children, especially considering the price you pay
5
Fell for this restaurant !!! The most amazing food in Singapore so far ( for the European taste at least) super service, attentive and with confidence. Wine list is original and priced perfect for the quality delivered. Take note that the restaurant is not in a touristy or busy area but still you must book in order to get in any day of the week.

We wanted something different for Sunday lunch and chanced upon Blu. The staff were most attentive and very friendly and welcoming. Service was very efficient and the food took just minutes to arrive at our table.The grilled octopus was incredible, and so were the sardines; they are indeed very fresh from the Mediterranean! The tzatziki is just perfect with the pita....but the piece de resistance has to be the mixed grill platter. It was perfectly succulent, and the spicedmeatballs were also fab. Washed down with a Greek white wine it made a great start to the Sunday afternoon

Brought my european friend for dinner, very nice decoration throughout the restaurant but seating area was very cramp and tables were so close to each other. crazily expensive even for simple meal! my dish was soak in olive oil..some of the dish was either extremely sour as they put vinegar and some extremely salty...terribly overprice...i came here because the review was good on tripadvisor..most European was probably there becos of the wine and not for the food..

This is one the nicest restaurants I've been to in Singapore. It has the real Greek family restaurant feel to it. The food is authentic and tasteful. Good selection of medzes and main courses. One of the waiters warned us not to order too many dishes as the portions are quite large. He was right and it was very attentive to point that out. We had some tzaziki and keftedes as starters. The keftedes were delicious! For mains we had the souvlaki wrapped in pitta bread and the lamb chops. Both were fantastic and cooked as we ordered them. All the way through we were attended by excellent staff.The restaurant has outdoor seating which personally I didn't find too attractive. So I would reserve a table inside. Also, this a place to go with friends or family. If you are after a quiet candlelight dinner for 2, you will probably find the place too busy and noisy.We had a great evening out and we will for sure go back there on our next trip to Singapore

There is nothing like eating authentic Greek food in a perfect ambience. The service is great and the food doea all thw talking here! Specially, for a vegetarian like us, it was a delight to have lovely choices. Also, don't miss out on the house wine. It may be a little pricey but is totally worth your money.

Lovely ambience in blue and white. Great food, and outstanding service.Complimentary valet parking is a godsend given the difficulty of finding a parking spot nearby. The owner suggested a wine from the list, and complimentary shots of brandy and Ouzo post dinner rounded off an excellent evening. While kitchen closes at 10 pm, we were at the restaurant till almost midnight, and the owner and service staff were very gracious and not once looked harried or as if they wanted us to leave.Very highly recommended

This is a small, very busy, friendly local restaurant with terrific food and good prices. The food is some of the best Greek food I have had - delicious feta cheese in honey and sesame, very tasty meat and fish. We allowed the charming man in charge to select for our party of 8 - and it was all excellent. It's quite noisy but that adds to the atmosphere. We will definitely visit again (and again I suspect ). One note - you probably need to book but that's just a reflection of its popularity and it's good to go in a group as you can share a selection of dishes. Also (unusual for Singapore) the service from all the staff was great.

Very good restaurant ,we went Many times,friendly people,helpful.
Quality food,they use olive oil and their imagination!
It's traditional greek restaurant .
Don t miss the chance to try saganaki fig!

Came for dinner on a weekend and the restaurant was packed. However we were quickly shown to our table on the second floor. The staff was very friendly, attentive and personal. They were also very knowledgeable about the menu as they were able to explain to us each dish that we ordered. The owner also came to provide some recommended. We had the greek salad which was very fresh and authentic. We also shared the meatballs with yogurt dips. The grilled octopus was certainly our favorite. It was served as a long tentacle, grilled and seasoned very nicely. We also had the meat platter which was a good portion comprising of minced meat, lamb, beef skewer. The meat were well cooked. Recommended for authentic greek food in a cozy resturant with good friendly servic
5
Great restaurant and fantastic decoration. It is on 3 floor, quite small but very nice indeed. You need to book at least a week in advance or you won't find a table. Fantastic food, really typical Greek with a good choice of wine. A place to go if you feel like eating Greek in Singapore. I will for sure go there from time to time
5
We we fortunate enough to have dined here last night. The place was busy with a great buzz. We were shown to our table and presented the menu's. At first glance it appears a very unfussy menu but look a little deeper and the sharing platters make an interesting choice. We were then guided through the menu and made our choices. We had some mixed starters and they were fantastic. Following this we had a huge Greek salad and main courses. The food was delicious and plentiful.Don't miss this restaurant!

We had dinner at Blu kouzina last Valentine's Day. It was my first time to try Greek food and i fell inlove right away. We had Tatziki, Greek salad, grilled Octopus and sardines. All we did enjoy but my all time favorite was the Tatziki. Fast service, indeed very friendly and willing to assist. I can't wait to be back
4
We celebrated our friend's birthday at Blu Kouzina last weekend and had a really great time. The four of us went on a Thursday night and the restaurant was bustling even at 9:30pm in a very residential neighbourhood. We ordered two dips, a fish, a beef and a rice. All were really delicious. And their manager came over a few times asking how the meal was and if we needed any explanations on their dishes. He was funny and friendly making the whole experience even more memorable. We all said we would definitely go there again

What a great restaurant and I'd definitely come back. Thanks to our friends for the suggestion.I live in Singapore and to be honest, non Asian food is pretty hit and miss here and usually pretty average value. I was really happy with this restaurant firstly because it was authentic (why pay for 'western' that is prepared in an Asian way?) and also because the food was really good and expertly prepared.The restaurant has a nice taverna feel - very friendly and you actually do feel like you're in Greece. The management is Greek and very friendly as they work the tables and make you feel like home. The crowd is friendly and looking for a good time - it's casual.Food most importantly was delicious. We shared a bunch of starters which were all simple but really delicious. We had octopus and the meat plate for main course which we all shared. Greek white wine was really nice as well and so were the desserts.What a nice place to have here in Singapore and look forward to eating here again
4
We had a very good meet with friends here. The size of the starters are small enough that you can order several to get a good sampling of the food. We got the meet sampler for 2 and it definitely too much for two. Good recommendation on Greek wine. Only issue was air-conditioning didn't seem to be working well so it was a bit warm.

we had heard a lot about this place. we had even had to return empty handed once as it was too crowded and we did not have a booking. perhaps because of this our experience sufferred?well the place is crowded and even for Sunday dinners you will find it difficult to get a place without a booking. the decor is nice. although climbing up 3 floors might not be everyone's dream of starting a good meal. that said, the climb up (if you get a table on that floor) does add to the appetite and it is rather quaint. would not advise it though if you have bad legs. back to the decor. it is almost minimalist and quite neat. it is also quite bright. mind you we had gone for dinner. so it gives you a flavour of the med sun i guess.the menu is not extensive but it is not too short also. there are a lot of aubergines on the menu. the tzatziki and the beef kebab (the balls) are out of the world. very very nice. the lamb chops and the beef skewer were also good. the latter was better. the quality of the meat was good and it was very soft. the cooking was very simple. the service is good. not wow but not bad by any stretch of imagination. overall nice experience. would like to repeat just for the beef balls
4
The menu may be all Greek to westerners but the food is very appreciated. The appetizers, particularly the taramosalata, are very good and among mains, the fresh grilled fish of the day and the grilled meats stand out. The downstairs area is not pleasant --very narrow, smoky and noisy. And the tables outside are now on an extremely busy highway which is difficult to travel because of extensive MRT works in the area. But there's a better seating space upstairs.The Greek wine list is fine and almost reasonably priced. Good, friendly service. By Greek standards, the food is not especially original; however it's very good quality Mediterranean fare, uncommon for Singapore
5
Honestly superb food and the friendliest staff I've ever encountered, I would definitely recommend dining here, especially for the tzatziki!
5
It's rare to find really good Mediterranean food in Singapore but this place achieves it. The food is simply cooked and relies on the burst of flavor to come from the freshness of its ingredients and its intoxicatingly-good olive oil, truly the elixir of the gods! We've now visited 6 times and it's so hard to choose because everything is so good, from the mezze plate to the exceptional potatoes fried in olive oil, to the lamb chops, to the souvlaki mi pita. Special mention should go to the grilled feta and the pita bread which is golden and light and bears no resemblance to the stodgy flabby slab usually sold here bearing the same name. Beautiful Med decor, great ambience and service as well. It's not cheap but given the quality of the ingredients used it's very reasonable indeed

We've been twice to Blu Kouzina and have really enjoyed the experience on both occasions. The food is great - in their cooking they liberally use an organic olive oil imported from Kalamata, Greece, which is delicious - portion sizes are fair and both food and drinks are decent value for money. Wide variety of Greek drinks available, including an ouzo made in Kalamata, Greek wines etc. Service is attentive but not disruptive, and recommendations as to specials spot on. We were never oversold, which is something that can happen at some places in commercially-minded Singapore. The Greek guy running the place is friendly and engaging - he actually seems to care that you have a good experience, and this is reflected in the attitude of the staff as well. Nice atmosphere, we really like the tables on the second floor. Highly recommended but reservations a must on the weekends
4
My husband and I joined two couples (Blu regulars) for dinner. After reading mostly rave reviews, I had high expectations of the food and the service. We ordered the taramasalata (perfect with the bread), the Greek salad (good quality ingredients), a green salad (refreshing), and a grilled fish/cuttlefish/prawn platter (beautifully presented). Everything was well cooked and tasty but there was no wow factor. I suppose that's because Greek food is pretty basic to begin with. The service was outstanding all evening long. I loved the blue and white decor. Perhaps the best part of the meal was the dessert. The yoghurt with honey was really something special -- the yoghurt was rich but light and oh so smooth. Fantastic
4
had an excellent meal there. George was extremely helped us choosing our food - and we'd gone there with regulars so between them, they knew what to order. the jumbo prawns were super. as were the lamb chops and beef patties - you must try all these. an amazing meal
5
Great food and great value. My personal favourites: the octopus which is beautifully grilled with olive oil and lemon, the kefalotiri psito (baked cheese) with fig and the grilled lamb chops. My two teenage kids love the meat platter which not only tastes sensational but is great value, (my kids are at an age where they devour everything, so it is fantastic to find a place in Singapore that offers great taste, quantity and value without having to go some hotel buffet). The wine list is a bit tough to navigate so we would often ask the manager for his wine recommendation and he always recommends a nice wine and always at a good price, nothing crazy. Great place for family, friends and couples
4
This is a relatively well known restaurant close to our house! I am generally wary of restaurants which have a reputation as they generally raise my expectations and then fall from a cliff! Thankfully the short brisk walk from my house worked positively on my demeanor and I was in high spirits when I landed at the restaurant .The ambience is simple and understated and the large crowds were served with a casual friendliness than can only happen when the. Owner is involved and loves what he does The starters we ordered were standard fare but served quickly and superb to taste The main course came in on time and the famous unfriendly service that this city is famous for was not in viewOver all this has been the best meal in Singapore so fa
4
I went there with a friend based on the good reviews: food, service and atmosphere were perfect. Portions are big and we could munch on 2 starters for hours! The prawns are amazing and desserts on the house :) Defo worth trying for a friends night out.
5
This is a great restaurant,buzzing with friendliness and warmth.The best Greek food I have eaten anywhere is served by marvellous staff.Delicious taramasalata,brilliant smoky eggplant,fabulous grilled lamb and on it goes!The wine list is especially good and some high quality white wines from Santorini were a real bargain.Share everything,sit back and enjoy a truly wonderful experience.The more the merrier

I had not visited the Greek restaurant Blu Kouzina till this month when I dined there with a friend. It has turned out to be a great discovery (as it is, there are few Greek choices in Singapore) - and one that I will be returning to. The tzatziki that I had was freshly-made and superb - and so much better than the grocery-store variety. The meat in the souvlaki was quite supple. The only gripe I have is that it is perhaps a little pricey for what it is, with all the appetizers around S$20 and mains around S$30. There is also an extensive Greek wine list
5
Great food, with fantastic flavours and really tasty ingredients. Decent service, nice ambience. Its a bit pricey but a top notch meal was had..
5
After leaving in Greece for two years, Blu Kouzina brought back many many memories of our wonderful time there. The food was authentic down to the ambiance and music.
5
My partner used to live in Greece and knows top quality authentic Greek food - the food here is just sensational. All of the ingredients are really fresh and the olive oil is sourced from Greece. The Octopus and grilled prawns were just delicious, and something a little different from what we might normally have had. The Manager was a perfect host, happy to recommend items from the menu and wine list, also telling us where different ingredients were sourced from. It's clear that they pride themselves on authenticity and excellent service.The staff are very friendly and attentive, and even when they restaurant was full everyone seemed to be served professionally and efficiently. It was busy despite being a week day which we took to be a good sign. There is really great attention to detail throughout the restaurant itself, the decor is simple but works perfectly - and even the bathroom is beautiful! Great atmosphere, food, wines, staff - I cannot recommend this place highly enough.So, if you're looking for something a little different in Singapore, or just an awesome meal and service - make a note of the location and jump in a cab, you won't be disappointed
4
I had a great dinner in this apparently new restaurant in bukit tima rd.Greek style for once! The food was very good and natural.The only dissapoint was teh the restaurant is located right on the main street and if you dine outside, the car going by may be annoying.But beside this the evening was great
5
It's hard to get a booking which in itself is a good testimony of the food quality and service.The overall dining experience is perfect. The starters are varied and are so fresh. The aubergine caviar is one of the best we've ever had.I settled for a lamb rack which was just superb. Very flavorful. The greek wine we were recommended matched perfectly our dishes.Given the quality of the starters, you could imagine having a dinner just around mezze.We'll be back
5
Have been meaning to go for so long and finally got the opportunity with friends last night ... and not disappointed. This is just really really good traditional greek food. We had the mixed plate of bifteke, souvlaki and lamb chops, with a greek salad, started with a mezzo and you could easily have been in one of a dozen restaurants in Plaka or Glyfada.The environment, is Greek basic (on purpose) and very pleasant. Staff and owners could not do enough for us to ensure we had a great evening, including a great suggested Greek red wine plus a surprisingly good Greek lemoncello as an after dinner digestive.A definite must and if you are vegetarian - sorry
5
A great greek restaurant in a residential area, excellent food and service. Very large portions, fortunately we were advised to order the grilled meat platter for two only with a side salad and it was enough for four of us (including two very hungry teenage boys). It is a bit pricey but worth it. Definitely one of our best experiences in Singapore.
5
Myself and my wife normally visit Greece every summer for holidays. This year we couldn't make it, instead working in singapore, I found this Greek restaurant and thought I'd give it a try. Food and service was amazing, like we were in Greece for 2 hours. Furnishings a decor, mythos beer, fava, souvlakia, souzoukakia, bougatsa all fantastic, great service from host christos, will go back
4
Blu Kouzina is a little bit far out, one would need the use of a private vehicle to get to Bukit Timah Rd, but as I found out, it was worth every bit of effort. Loved the restaurant- it had a wonderful homely Mediterranean ambience. The food was every bit hearty, and authentic- from our starters of Spanakopita and Bougiourdi to the mains Kotopoulo Fourno and Mousaka and dessert, Bougatsa. Perhaps the only drawback was that the bread served at the beginning of the meal was not complimentary and it was served cold. If you want to be transported to Greece, definitely make a visit to Blu Kouzina
4
Real good taste, nice variety of dishes, some surprise items like warm feta cheese, which I had never before, made this visit a pleasant surprise. The owner was a bit grumpy when I asked him why he had no Retsina but that didn't spoil the dinner
5
We are very fortunate to have found this place! Great authentic Greek food. Good service (hard to find in Singapore!) and very reasonably priced. Menu is authentic and of very good taste.
4
The greek restaurant on Bukit Timah road, is a fantastic little gem. It's a neiborghood restaurant with great atmosphere, fantastic service and authentic food. We have been several time and never have been disappointed. The menu is quite extensive and the special change very regularly.Highly recommended
5
Blu Kouzina is one of the only Greek restaurants that I have found abroad serving authentic Greek food at reasonable prices. Note that this is a review from a Greek person who visited Singapore and I would often visit Blu Kouzina if I lived there. The food is great, there is as much variety as you will need to choose from and I could not recommend that you pay a visit more. The atmosphere is quite nice, with many small surprises scattered around the restaurant, and unique traditional artifacts found in old time Greece decorating various corners, from the different rooms where food is served, to corridors, staircases and restrooms. I think the interior of the restaurant is quite well organised and I did not find it noisy at all. Moreover, the owners are a greek family who recently started this restaurant in Singapore, very friendly and nice people. The staff and service is also great, greeks and non-greeks alike. Don't hesitate to chat with them and feel a bit of greek hospitality from friendly, smiling people. This is as close as you will get to experiencing Greece without a visit to its beautiful beaches
5
My sister took us here as she wanted us to have a healthy meal away from all the Singaporean dishes we have been eating on. I love the ambience as soon as we walked in. Feels very Mediterranean and welcoming. We were surprised at the multi levels of this restaurant, it's huge. We ordered a bunch of dishes, wine and beer and everything was delicious! The service is excellent and the staff took their time to explain things to us. The place was packed even out in Bukit Timah area. Wish we live closer to Singapore so we can come more often
5
We'd heard good stories about this recent little Greek taverna on Bukit Timah Road and had the good reports verified for ourselves.It's a crowded and quite noisy little restaurant with both outdoor and indoor seating,run apparently by an extended family.Greek food is not one of the great cuisines but makes a nice change from the plethora of Italian and French places in Singapore.The food is the real thing:we had feta cheese and salad,octopus,sardines,beef patties,baklava,Greek coffee and it felt quite like being in Greece itself.The wine-list is not extensive but adequate,starting at around S$60 and extending up to S$350.I hate those restaurants in Singapore which offer only expensive wines,and the S$65 Italian Cabernet Sauvignon was good,and served at the correct temperature.The owner gave us some of his home-made sweet white wine at the end as a freebie,a nice touch.Throughout the service was friendly and efficient.Highly recommended
5
This was our first trip to Blu Kouzina, and it will not be our last.The restaurant has the feel of Greece, with the open windows downstairs. You can see into the kitchen in the front, and it has a Singapore kitchen A rating - tops for cleanliness.We were promptly checked on, and service was goodWe ordered the meat platter for two - 4 meatballs, 2 large burger patties, 4 lamb chops, 2 beef skewers, a ramakin of tzatziki, a soup bowl of fries, fresh bread made on site. I had a glass of red wine (an individual bottle), my companion had a Corona.Everything was wonderful. The meat was flavorful, tender, properly cooked. Dipping the fresh bread in the olive oil/lemon juice on the meat plate was pure heaven. The food was hot, the fries fresh and crispy on the outside, soft on the inside. Even with bringing my carnivore companion, we were unable to finish all the food - we stuffed ourselves and were grateful to do so!No room for dessert, unfortunately, but I had a Greek coffee medium - tasted just like in Greece, TYVM. Companion had a latte, and he said it was excellent quality, perfectly made.We will be back - truly enjoyed out dinner
2
We were eager to try this popular restaurant on the Bukit Timah as we love Greek food and had heard great reviews.We were sadly disappointed, the Spanakopita (filo pastry with spinach and feta cheese) were great but the grilled feta was just a slab of feta heated up. For our main course we had the mousaka, very boring and the beef kalamaki wrapped in pita bread which was average. We may just have been unlucky in our choices and I cannot believe they do not have humus on the menu.There was a great looking wine list but everything that’s on it seemed not to be available so we resorted to the house wine which was fairly poor.The service was friendly but seemed very inexperienced; they kept having to refer to someone else to answer many of the questions we had about the wine or food (Q. what sort of wine do you have? A. Red or White) I will not return to try this venue again or recommend it to anyone as there are lots more restaurants to try in this area that we have enjoyed more
5
Well-managed restaurant offering excellent Greek cuisine. Nice decor, relaxed ambience and very good service. Lamb is our favourite dish, and the (pre-ordered) Platter is something quite special indeed. Good selection of the classic Greek dishes. And the Wine List features quite a variety of Greek wines, most of them priced below 100 SGD. On the whole, the prices are high but nowhere near "extortionate.
5
This is a small place with lots of atmosphere and super friendly service. Even better the food is great and very authentic. Try the Greek salad and pita for starters and then follow with some of the best lamb chops in town. Prices are not low but certainly reasonable for the quality of food and service. This was the first time I went to Blu Kouzina and I will definitely come back
2
Many people had recommended so it went on the bucket list before we were leaving, very disappointing. Unfortunately we did have to shift our time as we were delayed prior. So we were a litte late and moved to the upstairs after we had ordered downstairs. We came upstairs to hear that other tables being offered specials yet we had not been. Our starters came then our mains within a few minutes, we didn't have any rest time. This we noticed didn't seem to happen to everyone else. I also get annoyed when you go to restaurants and you know you can cook better at home, this was the case here too. Wine selection was good food was OK but nothing to write home about unfortunately
5
This has become one of my regular spots as the food is always excellent, the wine white, crisp and reasonably priced. Try the fried cheese with figs and they do fabulous meat dishes!
4
A Greek Restaurant frequented by the Greeks! What more does one need for authenticity of cuisine served in a nice open seating!
5
Brilliant food in Singapore! Loved it. Lots of olive oil :) Surprisingly had good vegetarian options as well. Outdoor seating if weather is good
5
This restaurant is one of my favourite restaurants in Singapore, the blue and white visage is very attractive, there is seating upstairs, downstairs and in the open. It is very nice to sit downstairs in the view of the open kitchen and watch the food being prepared.I have tried many of the items on the menu and have found them all to be excellent, the taromsalata is the finest I have ever eaten anywhere.I suggest if you are considering visiting which I highly recommend that this not be considered a solo adventure, not that the food will disappoint, the choice would be overwhellming!An excellent place to visit with friends and sample all of the different starters and fish platter
5
Visited Blu Kouzina last night. Had an overseas visitor, my daughter, and wanted to impress.She was. One is always wary to take a visitor to a restaurant in case they have a bad night, by these guys never do. When I visit a restaurant I want 3 things. Good service, great food, and reasonable prices. Blu Kouzina ticks all these boxes. This is my 6th visit and I have never been disappointed. The manager George is always on he spot and nothing is too much effort. Highly recommended
5
I am a huge fan of Greek and and when it comes to Greek food I am very picky. This place blew me away with the food quality and service. Food was freshly made and wonderfully cooked. Staff made sure that our very need was met. I posted pictures in hopes that my review will persuade you to dine at this restaurant. Best Greek food bar none. Two thumbs up.
1
I love Greek food like you wouldn't believe!! When I visited Blu Kouzina, I was deeply dissapointed. Especially since it is the only Greek place in town.The outdoor seating in next to the highway. I felt like I was eating on the road. Service was really shady. Waiting a long time for food, then appetizers and mains coming at once. This ruined the dining experience for a party of 4 that wanted a relaxing time together. There really is no "cocktail list" there is only wine, of which half of the wine list is depleted (crossed out). Food quality was just ok. Was not exceptional. Taste was average. I was not wowed. Would been happier at fast food establishment to tell the truth. I do not recomment this restaurant
4
We have just come back from a family lunch at Blu Kouzine. This one gets a lot of recos among expats so we finally stopped by to check it out. we ordered some classic Greek starters which were very tasty though could have more garlic flavor. for main dish we tried a mix meat grill and also a small piece of octopus from grill. it was really good choice. definitely try octopus and lamb! finish everything with a Greek yogurt and good coffee. Greek owner and service was great but the local guys missed the charm and speed. ambiance is nice and reminds Greek tavern though outside surrounding is not the best (Bukitima road). Net, 5 star for food and Greek hospitality but one done for the rest.if you like the review your helpful vote is welcome. check out also my other reviews ;-

What to say about 'Blu'...?Decent ish food with the worst service I've ever come across...We were given a table on the terrace (12 feet away from te motor way)Two of us arrived waiting for the other twoWe asked for two drinks, and asked and asked again By the time one of our guests had arrived still no drinksEventually our 2 drinks arrivedThen our final guest arrived & and 2 more drinks were orderedAnd we asked and asked and asked and then they arrivedWe ordered starters and main coursesEventually one of our starters arrived With no pitta ....We (you've got it!) asked and asked and asked where the pitta wasEventually the other starters arrived together with one of our main courses!So we sent the main course back and asked where the pitta was...... So the waitress went to another table and picked up a half eaten pitta and gave it to usNeedless to say we sent it backAnd waitedAnd waitedEventually it arrivedStarters were okish, nothing to write home aboutThen as we were still eating out starters the 'waiter' arrived and asked if we were ready for our main courseWe explained that as he could see we're still eating So he then said I'm afraid I have to bring them as they are ready...Given no choice we took the mains which were ok Nice fish but the moussaka was not the bestPerhaps because it had been sent back with the starters and been kept warm...?Whenever we asked for service we had to hold our arms up like children in a school and made to feel uncomfortable by the manager/owner I feel that we were being ignored as we must have been classed as 'awkward' customers perhaps?The only awkward ones here were the staff who knew nothing about serviceWhen asked for the bill it took ages and then they had no pen for us to use to sign the slipAt some point we were asked of every thing was okWe explained the issues about the service and that the food was genuinely niceBut after that we were completely ignored and when we left no one thanked us Def a no no for us ever..
5
We enjoyed very much some new and exciting tastes. We tried a number of the entres and enjoyed them all. Had the beef souvlaki and it was delicious. Good service, authentic tastes, nice ambience though quite cosy. reasonably priced wine and quite reasonably priced for the quality food. We'll be back
4
nice cozy restaurant that serves really good greek food.
love the feta and beef, will be back for more.
5
Faristo to the Owners who opened "Blu Kouzina" in Singapore. Thank You a hundred times over...we finally have decent Greek Food in Singapore. I had the "best" lamb chops (outside of Australia that is) recently here; they were fresh, juicy, tender and cooked to perfection. The chefs know what they are doing here; the appetizers were delicious. We tried the smoked hummous; stuffed red peppers with feta; spanakopita - all were outstandingly delicious! and washed down with a couple of gin and tonics on a hot tropical evening - perfection!So thank you to Owners, Chefs and great wait staff at B.K. This is my fourth visit here...and our palates are satiated each and every time. We'll be back...very soon
4
The host/owner was warm and friendly, taking us through the menu and recommending when I confessed that I had never been to a Greek restaurant before. We ordered the yoghurt dip, pita bread (anticipating that the bread served alongside the dip was not going to be enough) and a seafood platter for 2. The seafood platter was done very well, with the grilled fish a masterpiece in terms of texture, doneness and smokiness. His wine recommendation was spot on and went well with our orders. Will be back for the meatballs which we didn't have the stomach to try this time round. Due to the place, tables are packed quite closely together. It is possible to hear the next table's conversation, so if you're looking for strictly romance, this might not be the best place. Parking is tricky here, so utilise their valet service just in front of the restaurant on the main road
5
Went there last night busy and buzzing.. Great atmosphere lovley surroundings. The food was delicious . Been to Greece many times and know my food!! This was the best I've tasted for years ( never here in singapore) the lamb chops where cooked and seasoned to perfection.. Could easily be a Michelin star standard . The rest was also fab . Big portions and great fast service but not rushed at all.. Will be coming back again and again . Great value too. My only complaint was I had to share !!
5
Awesome greek food. In fact the best I've tasted, even when compared to Melbourne's best. Located in a three level old shop. Taverna like atmosphere. The service is excellent, especially when the owner looks after you and says that he'll just take care of you (let him...he truly wants you to have a good time). Last time I was there the owner kept the food coming and gave us a bottle of Greek spirit to enjoy for free. Very well priced and they even allow BYO to help you wash down the food with your favorite vino. Been many times and will return many times again. Don't miss this Singapore gem
5
Simply good greek food . Need to cone specially for it as it is not near the main tourist attractions but the $10 taxi from orchard road was worth it.It is expensive, as is all non asian food in singapore, but if u stick to the starters and first courses and skip the meat or fish main courses u can end up at around 50$ per personReccomended
5
The most amazing Greek restaurant in Singapore. The ingredients are all imported and the result is awesome. The Greek salad transports you to Greece, albeit for the restaurant being on a main road, but they have plans to relocate. The dips are delightful, the squid (marinated for 24 hours) is so tender and delicious, The imported Greek wines add to the experience. The sea bream cooked on a grill is both succulent and tasty

Terrific ambience in this cozy Greek restaurant that is spread out over 3 levels. Great selection of dips and kebabs. The basa fillet which was grilled was also very tasty. Being out of the Singapore central district makes it a bit tricky to get there and tougher to get back so ensure you have the numbers of the local taxi companies for your return tri

We have dined at Blu Kouzina more than six times and each time has been a pleasure. After relocating to Singapore we were excited to find a nice Greek restaurant in town. The specials and seafood have always been fresh and tasty. We particularly like the second floor dining room which is nicely decorated and very comfortable. The management and staff are extremely friendly and even welcoming to our often indifferent child.... Note: comparing the prices here to those available at a hawker centre is both disingenuous and completely misses the point. Unless you are prepared to take long flight, Blu Kouzina is a good bet for a little Greek 'escape'

Only found out about it on Internet having had enough of Asian after a week n Singapore. It has not only surprised me with the fantastic food quality, but the greek staff are genuinely interested in providing good service and treat you as if ou are visiting their home... Will be back again when api am back in Singapore

Great food and great ambiance. The hosts are just great and helped us select the perfect dishes and quantities as well. They also helped us with our wine selection and they we so good humored and we had a great time. The grilled shrimp, dips with bread were all out of this world. I asked for a grilled veg dish and they accommodated us. We have been back there several times and every time it's been a great experience.
4
This is my third or fourth visit and the service and food has been consistent. I have been told that this is not 100% Greek food but it still tastes good. Valet parking is a plus. Staff are a little clueless and they do get flustered when they are busy but are certainly not the worst I have seen
5
Just came back from Blu Kouzina. This was our second visit and both times we were very happy with the food, service and atmosphere.The Greek salad was delicious, and so were the other dishes.Yes, it's not a cheap restaurant but in this case, you get what you pay for!Valet parking is a real benefit

I went 5 friends last week and had a wonderful time. The food was very authentic, and this is coming from a die-hard Greek food fan. We sat outside on the patio overlooking the main crowded and congested road, which was a bit hot and humid, but the food distracted us from the unpleasantness (Some tips: try to make a reservation for indoors as it is nice and cool and nicely decorated). We ordered stuffed peppers and vine, leaves tsatsiki, taramasolata, spanokopita, grilled cheese, grilled seabass, the meat platter (and a lot more wonderful dishes that I can’t remember), and some greek wine. The fish nice and fresh. The staff was friends, and the service was good. The only drawback was that it was expensive. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone who likes Greek food

My wife and I were very excited to eat at this restaurant but was thoroughly disappointed by the service and food. The waitress did not know the wine list and the food was overtly oily and salty. We order starters and entrees and right off the food was serviced fast. I told the first waitress who brought the first entree although we did not finished starter to tell the chef to slow down. 5 minutes later the second entree came and I told the waiter to slow down. Another entree came and I asked for the manager. The manager was the owner and apologized and told us they will make us another grilled fish when we were ready. The fish came real fast and we expected they just warmed it up. Very disappointing and we were celebrating for a special occasion. I find the food mediocre and definitely not worth the effort nor time to eat there

Great starters, with superb salads of fresh, and very tasty ingredients. The meat platters are also excellent, with lamb and beef both cooked to perfection. A word of warning, however, the prices may seem high, but this is because the portions tend to be very large, especially for Singapore. I am more than happy to go and indulge in their salads and starters and skip the main altogether, to avoid being over-stuffed. Their stuffed vine leaves (Dolmades Gialatzi) are the best I have had anywhere too

I went there for my birthday lunch, and went back two weeks later for more! I've not had good Greek food since I left Australia (yes, there are many Greeks in Oz), and Blu Kouzina has certainly remedied that!For my birthday lunch with my mum, we had spanakopita (spinach-and-cheese filled filo pastry best I've ever had), grilled talagani (fresh cheese, with balsamic vinegar on the side, it's now my all-time favorite!), kalamaki souvlaki (skewered grilled beef), and the lemon-roasted chicken. The food was fresh, simple, and incredibly tasty. The souvlaki arrived well-done (I ordered medium rare), but they quickly replaced that with a perfectly medium rare one. The sliced raw red onions served on the side was the perfect complement to the beef, I couldn't stop eating it. The roasted chicken was half of a spring chicken, and it was a LARGE chicken. We had to doggy-bag some leftovers. It was tender, lemony, and dripping in the super-tasty olive oil it's cooked in. Oh did I mention that the olive oil was soooo delicious I wanted to drink every drop? It had a fruity flavor to it, very light yet tasty. It was perfect with the hot baked-on-the-premises bread. They also serves a Greek beer that was light and refreshing.I visited again two weeks later with some friends for lunch on a rainy Saturday afternoon, and they were all so floored by the food, the wine and the impeccable service. We ordered the grilled talagani and kalamaki souvlaki (again, still very good), grilled saganaki with fig sauce (another type of cheese, works very well with the fig sauce), grilled fish (never seen such perfectly grilled fresh sea bream, cooked to perfection from head to tail), grilled squid (again, perfectly cooked and seasoned, tender and fresh), and bifteki (beef patties with potatoes; absolutely delicious). For dessert, we had the galaktoboureko (filo pastry open-top dumpling with semolina cream filling), which was like a Greek egg tart, so good. The friendly host, Christos, recommended some Greek wines (I think they're called Boutari), and we polished off three bottles: a white (light, fruity, easy to drink, reminds me of Sauvignon Blanc), a red (not so full-bodied, but full of character, with some notes of plum, reminiscent of a good Merlot), and a rose (sweet, light, perfect wine to go with dessert). The small bottle of Greek Limoncello we had to close off the meal was also nice and mellow, not as tart as the Italian version, and (thankfully) not as strong.Aside from the fabulous food, the ambience is what really makes this restaurant a new favorite of mine. The upstairs dining room feels like we're sitting in (what I imagine) a Greek family's dining room in Greece. It's cozy yet stylish, and the blue-and-white theme is really relaxing and pleasing to the eye. We arrived at 1pm and left at 4pm, that's how comfortable it was.The only dumb thing I did was book a movie right after that. Boozy lunch+movie=NOT my brightest idea

Nice small Greek restaurant in Singapore. Typical Greek eating place in the typical Greek colours bright blue and white....Like a taverna in Singapore...The food is excellent and tastefull. George (Giorgos) the manager is a good host... He is a proud Santorini born Greek.Maybe remote and a bit far from the centre but every night people are having dinner there.Menu list is alo on their website so easy picking before you go...Loads of Greek wine as well....Offcourse prices are much higher than in Greece

It's not one thing in particular, in fact there a lot of things about this which should work - but it really is very good. The free valet parking erases the location on bukit timah as a problem. The multi level seating erases the 'mood' choice as the different floors have a different feel. The food in Singapore is highly competitive but the simply fresh menu is both different( Greek) and authentic.The staff are busy, but not in your face and are very friendly. The hosts are spot on. I have noticed however that over the past two years or so the portion sizes are getting bigger; so be careful not to over order. The various fish platters are a way to test and good value, the salads are excellent. The other clever thing is the wine and its pricing. The wine is great value, good choice and makes a nice change from almost very other restaurant in town. This place is definately worth a visit but book for a lively table on floor 1/2 or outside
4
We had a wonderful dinner; great food, nice selection, attentive service, and great tasting of Greek wines. Enjoy each dish, though the location leaves something to be desired. All the atmosphere makes you feel like you should be relaxing off a beach in Greece and then you look up and see Bukit Timah Road whizzing up in front of you. All things considered, we would definitely go back and eat there again
4
Dropped in for dinner last week. Very authentic Greek. Love the fact that so much produce comes from "home" with delicious olive oil, dips etc. plus an excellent wine list heavily focused on reasonably priced Greek wines.
5
At last a decent bubble and squeak in Singapore. Don't sit outside though unless you like breathing in excess carbon monoxide.
4
Greek Salad was super.Wines very reasonably priced.Meats were good.Seafood was not bad but pricey for what it was and could be better.Service was also good.In general I enjoyed my meal but thought it was a little on the pricey side. Not if it is a special occassion but it is if you want to go there regularly.The outdoor seating is also not ideal as it is right by a main road.All in all, I would still recommend it

We have now been to this place three times, and the food is great! This time, we went on 10 Dec for dinner. We just have to write a second review for Blu Kouzina because, well, we're feeling a little sheepish for giving it only 4 stars on our last review.All the dishes we have had have been delicious, but our big favorite is the fava (mashed yellow lentils), which is the only dish we have ordered every time we went. Other highly recommended dishes are the spanakopita (phylo pastry filled with spinach, feta and herbs), melitzanosalata (aubergine dip), kolokithokeftedes (zucchini patties) and the kalamaki souvlaki (beef skewer). The restaurant also has daily specials and this time we went, we had the vegetarian moussaka which we loved. In fact, we loved the food so much, we ended up ordering too much on all three trips and had to pack the leftovers.Granted, there are a few things we could nit-pick on: some of the dishes were a little too salty on this last occasion that we went (we're looking at you spinach rice!), the place is tightly packed and not for a quiet dinner etc. But given the quality of the food, the cosy, blue-and-white Greek interior, and the overall warmness of the staff's service, one should be grateful rather than complain too much. Yes, on all our three visits, we had good service from the staff who were smiley and very ready to help. Congrats to the owners of the place for a great restaurant. We will certainly go back in future

Located along the main stretch along Bulit Timah would certainly put some people off, having to deal with the parking and the carbon monoxide if you are seated outside ( which we were ) But once you sit down and have the food , you will understand why people are raving about this restaurant. They have converted me to a fan ! I had never appreciated much of the greek / mediterranean cuisine but their homemade dips and pita bread was amazing , we ordered the grilled platter of seafood & fish ( which was deboned for us ) and this would be a superb dish to order if you have a group of diners. ( not listed in the menu ) I will most definitely be returning with my family

I am not in a position to judge the authenticity of the food here since this is my first time at Greek Cuisine. However, one can appreciate the simplicity of the ingredients and the robustness of the flavors from the food at Blu Kouzina. They have other specials that are not listed on the menu.For more details and pictures, visit : http://dairycream.blogspot.sg/2012/12/blu-kouzina-my-big-fat-greek-dinner.htmlWe tried the classic Greek Salad , Red peppers stuffed with spicy feta cheese, grilled lamb chops , beef patties and 2 desserts.Do not worry as the waiters are friendly and would explain the dishes to you. This was a great cultural exposure to not only learn about the cuisine but also the Greek words...the meal here for five is about the same as a meal at a casual Japanese restaurant. Nonetheless, it would be good if the saltiness of the salad can be reduced and if they can offer the starters bread for fre

The venue is interesting.. you can dine out or in any of the the three inside floors. The menu caters for most tastes and the food just has the most wonderful flavours. Lemon, garlic and thyme evoke Greece.. The olive oil is so wonderful , it is a speciality of the house and the owners take great pride in bringing in olives from their own olive grove.This is a great venue to meet friends to eat fabulous dips, warm tender lamb and delicious chicken. There is a good wine selection. Another plus is that it is out of the Orchard area so it is not too difficult to get to
5
The food here is consistently good. Amazing starters, salads and best of all, reasonably priced wines which is such a welcome treat here in SG. The seafood platter is a real gem here, especially with the deboning service for the fish which makes the meal even more enjoyable. We tried the macaroni on our most recent visit and it was really delicious. Certainly one of our favourites her
5
Discovered this place by accident, and wwe were immediately taken in by the warmth of the decor, the bustling vibe and - of course - the first class food. Lots of Mezze type of appetizers, and a meat platter grilled to perfection. Special mention goes to their olive oil which is superb. Wish they wold sell it in household sizes - nothing like this in Singapore's supermarkets
5
If you crave crisp green salads and perfectly cooked fresh fish, you'll love Blu Kouzina too. We come here every time we're in Singapore, and it's always excellent. The simple, crisp, lemony salad sprinkled with dill is outstanding. And the lentil hummus with warm pita melts in the mouth. Everything on the menu is delicious. Plus, the staff is friendly, and the atmosphere is lively and fun
5
Fantastic food, wine, service and attitude, a bit far
5
A family-run terrific Greek restaurant away from the heart of town -- worth the drive. I have been there several times over the course of my last few visits to Singapore, most recently about a week ago. Consistenly excellent food at very reasonable prices for such excellence. I am partial to that nicely seasoned lamb patties and to various appetizers. Seating inside and out. Service is reliable pleasant, helpful and prompt
4
We went as a couple on a weekday evening, sitting in the air-conditioned second floor of the restaurant. These were what we had:- Saganaki with fig sauceThis is pan fried cheese that was very delicious.- Imam BaildiThis is an oven-baked aubergine with tomato sauce. It is served whole and the sauce is stuffed in the aubergine. - FavaThis is a mash/puree made of fava beans. This was D's favourite!- KolokifthokeledesZucchini patties made with various herbs and feta cheese- OlivesWe also asked for a side dish of green and black olivesOverall the food quality was very good, and they use organic Greek olive oil that was very fragrant. The olive oil is also available for sale. The second floor sitting can be a little tight and if seats are filled, you will most likely be able to hear your neighbour's conversation quite well. Nevertheless, we went there looking for good Greek food and we were not disappointed. As some other reviewers have said, the place is a little pricey, but at least the quality is there. There are not many Greek options in Singapore and this is probably one of the better ones.We would love to go there again! :
5
I have travelled many times to Greece and I would say that the food at Blu Kouzina is as good as anything in Greece, sometimes even better. It also has an atmosphere reminiscent of the Greek islands, if only we could replace Bukit Timah Road with the sea. The Greek wines are really reasonably priced too. Our favourites are the different starters like the aubergine dips, the feta in peppers, and the filo pastry with spinach and feta. The souvlaki is excellent too, as are the desserts
4
This is Greek food as we (Greeks) cook it at home, this is our mom's food at its best. Didn't expect such an authentic greek restaurant so far away from home, but, yes, Singaporeans are lucky enough to be able to taste real greek food cooked properly in home style at this beautiful place. A bit pricey, yes, but authenticity comes with a price when in the other end of the world i suppose... To the owners: Well done
3
The decor here is really nice and relaxing, good ambience and friendly staff. The Greek food is pretty good, although the squid was a little tough and the sauces a little salty for my taste. Good for a group function, although it was just the 2 of us this time. Didn't enjoy the Greek wine, maybe it's an acquired taste
3
I took my friend here for an early dinner in July. The place was just starting to fill up and had a really nice early evening buzz, we enjoyed the passing landscape of the area and chatted to some nice locals.The menu was nicely presented and we ordered some beers which went down well and then a mixed selection of dishes: bread, hummous, baba ganoush, falafel - it was tasty, just what we needed to start our night out in Singapore
3
We sat outside on a warm evening as I like to smoke which was nice. We had some Greek wine which was fairly ordinary and at about $75 per bottle seemed expensive. The place became busy and the staff seemed to not notice our waving at one point I stood up, waved both arms and the girl who seemed half asleep finally snapped out of it and came to serve us.The food i have to say was good Greek food. We had salade, squid, some chips and bread and they were all good.I am not sure about Singapore prices but the meal seemed very expensive, the service was very ordinary and that really spoiled the good food
5
This was our second visit, the first several months ago when we were in the mood for some good mediterranean cuisine. The first time we were pleasantly surprised. The place was more crowded than expected, for a small quaint kind of out-of-the-way old house converted to restaurant. Run by a very likeable and energetic Greek couple, it offers genuine Greek food and wine st quite reasonable prices.This time we ordered a couple of familiar starters, like the Imam Baildi (eggplant) and Spanakopita (filo pastry filled with spincah, feta and some herbs). We had some good Greek chardonnay (I forget the name), and some Grek liquere w/c went well with the ladies.For the main course, our daughters split the meat platter and my wife and I split a Koutopoulo Me Patates, a succulent, roat chicken dish that was absolutely delicious. The meat platter for two was generous, so fair value for what seemed a bit steep, and it was also really well prepared and tasty. It was a combo of meatballs, hamburger patties, lamb chops and medium sirloin on skewers. We topped the meal with their baklava with special home made ice-cream that we had requested when we booked, as Effie, the Mom of this Mom & Pop deal, advised us the last time we visited.Well worth the $340 (incl. tip) that we paid for thr 4 of us. Drawbacks? It was really very crowded in the Saturday night we went. Good thing we booked in advance by over a week. The acoustics are not great and because the place house is small, they have to squueze as many tables in each floor to make their ecoomics work, I guess. But notwithstanding that, it was another pleasant experience at Blu Kouzina. We will definitely be back for more

Being veggie can put you back in choosing a different cuisine at a place which may/may not have a dish for you.With these thoughts we did decide to venture to this restaurant,A good long drive brought us to its portal which looked too simple considering their origin country.The shade of "BLU" with a white smear sets the ambiance. Quick to settle down we waited for the friendly staff who laid out their veg options.We let them bring the starters with a bottle of wine to go with it.What was presented was a cuisine simply superb.We did quite a bit with their starters and shared the main meal =vegetables in a sauce which was excellent.The finale was their desert, which we did not have the mind to let go...so we indulged! No regrets.My next trip to this town will bring me here for sure
5
We went as a group of around 8 which was great as we could share lots of the excellent mezzo and later meat plates. Everything was fresh and well prepared. There was a great atmosphere for a group meal.
4
We have been here a couple of times and the food and wine are delicious and service good, we even enjoyed the greek wine so much we bought a bottle to take home. We prefer eating inside as it is close to a main road.
4
easy web booking, convinient free valet, warm welcome & good service, excellent food, fair price, ... can't complain
5
The food is indescribably delicious. The ingredients are fresh and top quality. The cooking is authentic Greek food at its best - the olive oil amazing, lovely fresh bread. The service efficient and quick without being fussy. A friendly owner-managed restaurant, and the owner is totally hands-on. We asked to purchase some of their olive oil and he gave us a complimentary bottle. I wasn't sure whether to order the sea bass or sardines and settled on the sea bass.. but he brought us a sample dish of sardines just to taste. And they were incredible.This is the type of thing that brings people back. We live on the East Coast, but if we were 5-10 minutes away we'd be here twice a week. Well done Blu Kouzina
5
Ive often drove past but never went in - big mistake. The service was fantastic and the quality of food also. Probably the best cuts of meat in Singapore. Value is excellent and service at the table rapid.Overall I rate this as one of the level best on the island and one I'll certainly be returning to on a regular basis.
5
Excellent evening with the wife. We spontaneously decided to leave the kids at grandma's and go for a couple dinner. It so happened to be six months to the day since our return from a holiday in Greece, and when we arrived at Blu Kouzina, we felt like we had been transported right back.The colors, the decor, and the owners are as Mediterranean as it gets. It was hot, due to being seated on the ground floor with open windows, and close quarters. The host/ owner was lovely, with an eye for detail to make sure every diner is happy.We shared a Greek salad (~ S$ 19) for starters. This is usually served here with sea salt, too salty for my wife's taste. It was exchanged immediately and without awkwardness. We followed up with a sea bass (~1kg, ~ S$ 89 ) which was grilled, and served simply with olive oil and lemon. In addition, a small helping of dill potatoes and grilled bell peppers/ eggplant.We got through all this, felt great, followed up with apple slices in Greek honey with cinnamon sprinkles- light and pleasant (~ S$ 6). The owner offered a taster of Greek red wine (Utopia) which gave an appetite for more.The dinner came to S$ 140 for two, no wines. Some reviews have pointed out that the cost is high for simplistic food. But all too often, simple food turns out bad- here, we experienced what delight "simple" can give.We will be back
5
My expectations were high, having read about this place. And they were exceeded. The food is outstanding. The wine recommended by the owners was superb. HIghly recommended: the spanakopita (best ever), dolmades (fresh!), roast chicken (half a small baby chicken). The fresh fish was great, and the olive oil simply outstanding. We will be going back there many many times
2
I was excited to try this place as I love Greek food but was immediately struck by how expensive everything was. The starters were all around $20 a plate and by that I mean a small plate of tzatziki cost $20. It was very good but let's remember it is just yogurt, garlic and cucumber. When I asked the server (a Greek lady who I assume was the owner although she never introduced herself as such) if she did an appetizer platter (something I think a must in Greek restaurants) she was quite grumpy and said she used to but put a stop to that????? The rest of the food was nice--and the other server was actually quite friendly and prompt with drinks but the bottom line was the food was just okay and the prices ridiculous. Don't bother
3
This is the first Greek restaurant I've eaten at in Singapore; food was pretty good - we shared a meze plate between the four of us and that was ample. Hummus was good; stuffed vine leaves not so much to my taste, but that's like going to a burger joint and complaining you don't like minced beef.There's outside seating, but no scenic view, unless you like watching traffic on Bukit Timah road. However, there's not much traffic noise, or at least not enough to distract us, despite the volume of cars going past.Where the restaurant falls down is the service; food is good if and when it gets to you, but more than once we watched our waiter walk all the way around the tables with our order, apparently offering it to anyone he thought looked likely (apart from us, strangely enough). Despite trying to attract his attention we had to chase him into the restaurant before we could finally get our bread.But at the same time, if they know who they're serving, the staff can be quite attentive (we were having a birthday celebration and at the end of the evening a piece of baklava with a candle in it and a rendition of 'Happy Birthday' materialised quite unexpectedly) - so as long as you have some tolerance and patience, you'll probably enjoy yourself
3
Although the food was good, service was not, and our overall experience was rushed and uncomfortable. We will not be back. On the upside: We really enjoyed all the food. Everything was fresh and delicious.Started with Tzatziki, Bougiourdi - Red Peppers stuffed with spicy feta cheese, and Spanakopita - filo pastry filled with spinach, feta cheese, and herbs . Mains we had included Xoriatiki - Greek Salad, tomatoes, cucumber, onion, olives and green pepper, topped with extra virgin olive oil and organic vinegar, Souvlaki me Pita - Beef kalamaki wrapped in a pita (the Greek way), with fresh tomato and red paprika. Served with chips.- please eat it wrapped and also, Grilled Squid - Grilled with lemon and extra virgin olive oil.BUT:Wait staff need alot of work. Our meal was not the relaxing one we'd hoped for, largely because of this. We experienced either over zealousness, blank stares or complete ignorance from our waiters. Service deteriorated as the restaurant filled up too.Wine list not good at all. All the whites are Greek. The one we ordered was a reasonable S$70, but presented to us at room temperature! Once chilled, it unfortunately also turned out to be undrinkable. We couldn't get through more than a third of the bottle. That is highly unusual! Stick to Mythos beer and have a drink when you get home.Customers next to us turned off the air con unit next to their table, as it was blowing directly on them, making the rest of the room stuffy and uncomfortable. We were upstairs in an airconditioned room. There is an option to sit outside or downstairs with fans, which looked alot better, but the restaurant is on the busy Bukit Timah Rd...not the best outlook.Unfortunately, the negatives outweighed the positives for us
5
I have been to Greece and I really missed the Greek food. Thus, I will patronise The Blu Kouzina. Good Greek salad with generous Feta Cheese. The seafood and meat are good and fresh. Price is reasonable and the service is good.
5
Beautiful atmosphere (we sat upstairs), reasonable prices for the food and wine, great food and service!
5
Every time i / we go to Singapore we must visit Blu Kouzina - the food is simply unforgettable. I could live only from the starters - the baked Feta cheese with Figs being just sensational. After having finished them, you will hardly be able to eat any of the mains (fish of the day or meat dishes). I never managed to eat a dessert - just impossible.The owners take very well care of the guests - always find time for a word, though the place is super busy. Must reserve - otherwise you might go home hungry
4
My wife is Greek and so we sometimes go to Blu Kouzina for Greek dishes. The dishes are authentic and very good. As incredients in Singapore are not like in Greece you might expect more if you are Greek yourself but it is decently good and tasty. They even have horta, if you ask for it. Usually they have a fish of the day, which they will recommend to you - take it
4
I was with my wife for dinner on a sunday evening. We order grilled squid and beef skewers in a pita. Both orders were delicious and under $20 each. The restaurant is crammed with very little room to walk indoors. Outdoor seating was right beside the busy bukit timah road which doesnt feel quite right given it`s a Greek restaurant. This took one star away. Dessert was almost non existent on the menu. The bread was cold and below average. The place is nicely decorated and definitely feels Greek. Go for the food otherwise look elsewhere.
3
It is a small restaurant located amongst others on the Bukit Timah. The interior and terrace is done lovely in whites and blues. Menu is very Greek so there is a lot of meat. It was a very nice place for a weekday dinner with nice staff.Because it is located on the Bukit Timah, there is quiet some traffic in front of the terrac
4
I am aiming to try out the top 10 restaurants in Singapore (per tripadvisor ratings) and kicked off my quest with this one.It's every bit as good as the other reviewers rate it. Loved the charming oh-so-Mediterranean feel of the restaurant...the service was unassuming and friendly. As with any Greek restaurant, the menu had lots of options for my vegetarian friend... everything from the yogurt with cucumber to the vine leaves stuffed with rice to the meatballs, etc. was great!The only reason for not giving it an excellent rating is that I felt it was a bit on the steep side (a meal for 2 - a starter, main and glass of wine each was around $100). Nonetheless, I would certainly go back
5
What a gem to find this Greek restaurant in Singapore! I am Greek - and hands down found this to be some of the best authentic cuisine that I have ever had! Well done! Will make this a regular visit each time I return to Singapore

We have lived in Singapore for 6 years and Blu Kouzina is one of our favourite restaurants. The location, along Bukit Timah, is somewhat odd but well worth the journey in case you live in other parts of the island.Blu Kouzina is set-up by Effie Tsakiris, a South African with Greek family roots. Her husband Dennis works as a financial controller for a leading FMCG company and is spending most of his free time in the restaurant to help out. The family’s four children also make the occasional appearance even though less frequently than when the restaurant was newly opened. The result is a family run establishment with a lot of warmth and character – something quite unusual in Singapore.The food is very good with a number of star attractions including the Cretan Dakos salad, the Fasolosalata bean salad, the Maroulosalata lettuce, dill and lemon salad plus the wonderful grilled fish platter with prawns and squid together with your choice of fish. In many ways, Effie’s cooking is like a Greek version of London’s famous River Café and we do hope that Effie will take time to write one or more cook books so that we can try out some of her recipes at home. Blu Kouzina has a good wine list heavily focused on Greek wines. There are a lot of choices for less than SGD 50 which is very welcome in a city where you sometimes have rather few affordable wine choices. You can also get retsina which the owners call a “village drink” and have relegated to a separate section away from what they consider proper wines.The restaurant is spread over 3 levels plus an outside patio area. Our favourite spot is to have one of the few tables near the kitchen on the first floor. Unlike the two upper floors, this is non-aircon, but you are close to the action in the open kitchen.If you become a frequent visitor, the owners might give you a free sample from time to time – something which is almost unheard of in Singapore. This could be some newly arrived Greek sweets, some farmhouse cheese, a free trial of a new starter or a glass of ouzo.If you are into genuine Mediterranean food in general and Greek food in particular, you will likely be pleasantly surprised by Blu Kouzina. Just don’t come expecting deep-fried calamari – Effie considers this dish far too touristy to appear in her repertoire of classic Greek homecooking. We hope Blu Kouzina will be around for a long time
5
love, love, love this place! from the welcoming owner to the amazing, amazing food - Blu Kouzina has become one of our favorite restaurants in the island. Perfect to spend a delicious evening with friends. Great choice of Greek wine and have the greek salad: best feta in the world right there
