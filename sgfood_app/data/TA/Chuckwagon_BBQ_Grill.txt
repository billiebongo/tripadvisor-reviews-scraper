Been there several times, and each time we were not disappointed. Cosy ambience, fantastic people, and good food to match. Parking is also easy as they have their own car parking area.
A hidden gem.

I do feel there is so much more potential given the location! The wings here are delicious and perhaps the ribs. Not too excited about the rest tho.

We have been patronizing this place for several years now. Each time we came back feeling great, not only for the IPA, choice of food & ambience but also because of the personalized attention bestowed upon us. Denise & Guy always made us feel at home without intruding

Very pleasant service. The place was rather quaint nestled amidst quite a lot of greenery. Good place to chill on a Saturday night. Only problem was the food was quite expensive and not fantastic. Had the ribs which could use some improvement. Meat was okay but the sauce it came with was very wanting. Fish and chips were quite good. Clam chowder was average. Overall for the price I was paying, I expected much better.

My partner and I always loved this place . The food is great and the staff are even more greater. They are so friendly and would take lengths to serve you well. We have been coming here for the last 3 years of our stay in Singapore and now I can always say I have missed the place. The prices are reasonable for what they are and nothing beats excellent customer service. They never failed us in this area. Would love to come back

We didn't have the wings, just some beer and onion rings.The beer was not ice-cold and was way overpriced compared to the Holland Village bars which have a lot more vibe and buzz. The onion rings were terribly greasy. The restaurant refuses to serve tap water ( perfectly safe in Singapore), so that it can squeeze the customer for a few extra bucks by serving bottled water. Shows a complete lack of environmental awareness. Such execrable practices should be banned by the authorities.The service was okay, and the setting is nice, but I certainly won't be back to this very mediocre place. So many other places to go in Singapore

We actually had a small family & friends get together to celebrate our wedding. We chose buffet style dinner & we get to customised our menu according to our budget. Food was fantastic and all our guests were happy & enjoyed themselves. Surrounding environment is cosy, not much traffic around that area, making it a decent place to have a nice chat, relax while enjoying the good food & drinks. Alcohol drinks available. Friendly, helpful & attentive staffs. Try their buffalo chicken wings and ask for your preferred level of spiciness.

Chuckwagon BBQ & Grill (Singapore), What can I say about her? Apart from it's distinct colonial motive location. I was greeted with a scenery that I never thought existed in this modern metropolitan. Greenery and fresh air. As I strut my way in passing it's private parking space, I was then greeted by one of their staff. Asking if I would prefer a smoking or non smoking table. Led to my table for 4 pax, I quickly settled in and was given a brief introduction on their infamous wings. (I Had that I'm a first time look on my face). -.-"April, one of their staff guided me along which level of hot wings sauce I should opt to enjoy optimal taste. I ended up ordering half a dozen of level 2 wings "The Bad" they had it named. On my list was their pork ribs and a pint of hoegarden beer. Having placed my trust in April, I excitedly wait for my orders to be serve.The wings arrived shortly after the magarita made its' appearance. Impressive service so far! The smell of the hot sauce was rather distinctively appealing. I'm half thai and spicy is my thing! Served with a side of vege sticks and blue cheese dip, Chuckwagon "The Bad" wings got me wanting more. As I was almost done, the pork ribs made it grand entrance with a side of spicy wedges and salad. I can't help but to notice that their pork ribs had a mild after tea taste. INTERESTING! An hour later after a couple rounds of hoegarden, I was ready to take my leave but hence as the title says,"So Finger Licking Good I Had To Bring Back Half A Dozen Of Wings Back."Thank You Chuckwagon for the experience. My word is : come and try it yourself.Regards.

TO be honest, the food was fantastic but i cant say much about the service.Staff approached and asked if we needed a smoking table and we say no but checked if we could see outside and the answer was sorry fully booked. (Well the whole area was only occupied by 2 other tables)Staff approached and asked for orders, pointed a few and the reply was sorry its too much food and there wont be enough space for the table and cancelled out our orders for us. Seriously :(Well the good thing was I tried the level 5 wings with my friends and well. It was burning bad :p(Go for level 3 or 4 guys
