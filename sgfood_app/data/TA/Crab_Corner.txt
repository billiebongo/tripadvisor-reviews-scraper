New menu n more than just crabs. Crabs worth trying but about $70-80 per crab of 1.3-5 kg. Slightly Different dishes from normal TzeChar stalls. Reasonable price. Special discounted Peking duck n chicken above a certain $. Must book ahead. Can be crowded during weekends. Service is good n fast. Strongly recommend

Food was good. Curry Fish head is fresh. Clay pot herbal Prawns is super fresh. Crab are not that big and only around 700g. Pork intestine was yummy. Salted egg rib is creamy. Seafood fried rice and mee sua has the wok hei taste and yummy too. Overall my family likes the food greatly!! Service wise only the improvement is the no changing of plates thruout the whole meal.

The restaurant was located at the third floor of the mall, just next to the MRT station. The dine area was big with 2 private rooms and decorated in a stylish and modern way. For a weekday night, the place was relatively quiet, which made easy to get the attention of the staffs and for one to enjoy a relaxing meal.Claypot Chilli Crab 砂煲辣椒螃蟹 ($78)The sauce was more watery since it was served in a claypot. It made one want to reach for some buns to dip in the sauce. The crab was chopped up for easy handling although tool and disposable gloves were provided.Claypot Black Pepper Crab 砂煲黑椒螃蟹 ($78)The sauce was fiery and strong, and more on the salty side for me. Not the usually sweet version which I preferred but still tasted not bad. The meat was thick and chunky.Authentic Claypot Curry Fish Head 砂煲咖哩鱼头 ($26.80)The curry fish head was cooked chinese style, with lady's fingers, onion, tomatoes, eggplant, dried bean curd sheet, bean curd puffs, and curry leaves. Felt that the fish was steamed before pouring the gravy all over it, as the meat did not soak up the flavours of the rich lemak gravy. The gravy was very rich which made one wishing for a bowl of plain rice to go with.Crispy Roasted Duck (Regular) 天王脆皮烧鸭 ($16)It was served with plum sauce. The meat was tender and soft.Crispy Roasted Pork 脆皮烧肉 ($11.80)The meat was served with mustard sauce. The tender juicy meat, topped with a thin crispy crust.Barbecued Pork Belly 肥婆叉烧 ($18)The char siew was tender and juicy, but lacking of the char crispy which I preferred.Soy Sauce Chicken 汾酒酱油鸡 ($12)The meat was soft and tender, without the sauce overpowering.Besides the main menu, the restaurant also offered dim sum dishes until 5pm.Siew Mai with Tobiko 鱼子蒸烧卖 ($5.20)The dim sum was huge and packed with succulent, juicy prawns. The prawn roe was too little to make an impact on the already yummy dish.Prawn Dumpling (Har Gow) 虾饺 ($5.20)The dim sum was packed with chunky crunchy prawns. The skin was not too thick, which made it quite a mouthful bite. Char Siew Bao 叉烧包 ($4.60)The pau was soft and fluffy, packed with chunky savoury filling, which I felt a tab too salty. It was different from the commonly found sweet version.Mango Sago Pomelo 杨枝甘露 ($3.50)The dessert was creamy and refreshing without too sweet

We frequent this place almost monthly. Good value if you can get some other discount otherwise can be pricey especially the crab dishes. But the crab dishes are delicious - only Sri Lankan sizes. Average $20-30 per person for a normal meal. They also do not serve the usual Chinese or Cantonese cruisin

Chanced upon this outlet when visiting the new NTUC warehouse at Joo Koon. Restaurant has an open concept where it looks like part of the surrounding food court. Decided to try out the place as my parents were attracted by the big flashy signboards. We ordered the set lunch for three and it was decently portioned, priced and cooked. We were actually interested in their ala carte buffet after that. Will give it a try soon
