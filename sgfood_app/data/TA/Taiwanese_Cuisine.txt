Great service, the waitress are so polite and well manner. Plates has been changed once its filled up with sauce.. this is cetainly an added point as for cleanliness of the restaurant. Food is Good, taste Great, price wise is average. Yummy dessert is free for all.. It's surely a recommended restaurant especially those with big family! Seat arrangement are spacious, wheel chair and pram accessible

Zhe Char food ( basically they are restaurant-style food but at hawker centre prices) is among the locals' favourites & are widely available.However, a Taiwanese one is pretty unusual/rare. And it is very authentic as the owners/cook are native Taiwanese. And the menu are "locals" menu, just like what the locals Zhe Char stalls offers.And prices here are among the most reasonable too. Foodwise - its good too

This is our favourite stall whenever we want to have great Zhe Char food at good value.We have eaten here many times & find the food is still as good as before. And very inexpensive, as compared to the many other Zhe char stalls here.Quality & taste has been consistent because the food is always cooked by the same man ie the owner. Highly recommended if one wants good Zhe char food at great value

This stall is operated by a small Taiwanese family from Kaohsiung.Their food is some kind of a 'Fusion' food - local restaurant style dishes cooked only on orders made ( locally called Zhe Char) but with a Taiwanese flavour. Their food taste is close to what the local competitors offer but with an obvious nice difference.There are quite a number of local Zhe Char stalls in this huge food centre. I think there is another Taiwanese stall but from what I see, they are not the same food.Amazingly, their prices are among the cheapest generally here & compared to elsewhere . And the food taste good.If one is looking for a nice, cheap & yet different 'local' zhe char food, try this stall. This has became one of our favourite zhe char stalls.Note they are closed on Tuesdays.And don't come so early. Officially they open at 11am but often they are not ready till after 11.30am -12.00pm
