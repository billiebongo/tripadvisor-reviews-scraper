Had the tenderloin steak. Hubby had the pork chop. We shared a pasta. Was all good. Good value too. Didn’t like the karaoke though. Customer singing should be restricted especially if they’ve proven themselves mediocre
4
The food taste good and the kids had so much fun at the bouncy case on a weekend. Though some of the toys are abit old. The kids still enjoy it.
4
Nice pleasant restaurant. Place was okay and service can be really unpredictable. Sometimes its good but not all.
4
Good place for friends gathering. Food is nice and highly recommend to try chicken wings which taste really yummy.
4
The food is value for money! Although the portion may be small, it was delicious. A pint of beer is at $10 which is very affordable. Great ambience as well! :)
4
Nice ambience with good live music albeit just a single singer on his guitar. Cheap draft beer $10 per pint whole night. Food was meh only though but decent.
4
The menu is vast and so is the drink menu. A lovely place to sit and watch the world go by. They have great drink happy hours as well.
4
Stayed in Singapore for four days and this place was just around the corner on the way back to the hotel. Great atmosphere and very popular bar with great service and staff with good personalites. Stopped in after a day of touring and walking and always welcomed with a smile. Last night stopped for a snack as well as a couple of beers. Husband had mini burgers and said were delicious and my calamari unfortunately over cooked, but atmosphere made up for it and the live music on Tuesday and Thursday by gilbert just added to it. Highly recommen

Food serving was fast and the bouncing castle setup was good for the kids. However, the form mat at the landing of the bouncing castle was in bad condition (worn out and dirty) and slippery. The kids fell many times due to the slippery form mat. Might be better off without the mat instead. Food taste was slightly overpriced but ambience is good.
1
I reserved as group of 37 including 18 kids.The arrangement is much less than we expected. We had to wait for at least 3 days for the reply. She constantly force us to appreciate her arrangement although it was really poor and unprofessional. She missed our request all the time, I needed to send her text message so many times to aske her to reply the email. Very difficult to communicate with Trecia. And eventually, she didnâ€™t even show up on the day itself. We are not very happy with the service of Diatrict 10
4
We love district 10 because of the bouncy castle, not too crowded and they serve decent food at decent price.
5
Stopped here after a long flight. The waiters were enthusiastic. The beer was cold and the pizza was delicious. Wide ranging menu.
5
$14 for two glasses of wine during happy hour, with bites reasonably priced and a chill atmosphere. Certainly worth a visit.
4
Great chill out place with beer at $10nett all night and selected wines at 1-for-1. Food is also v good.
5
....not long ago I moved to downtown and I came across this great little place. After a long day at work I found it perfect for enjoying a few savvy beers like the fresh tasting 1664 blanc... together with my favor finger food "natchos" its the little extra that just makes your day. Happy hour during the week (except of Mondays) with SGD 10,- net for a pint of 1664 blanc is acceptable in a Singapore prime spot...and live music is swell yoo... will be seeing you there again..
3
My only regret is that it seems that everywhere we went in Singapore they had watered down drinks (I am not a big drinker but in the US I usually get a little buzz from one drink but in Singapore that did not occur This bar is for Singapore standards perfectly reasonabl
4
Had a great meal at this restaurant. The food and drinks are both very good with a diverse menu, they even had goose leg! Service is attentive and they explain well when asked what an item has. They also made a substitution as one of our party required. Nice ambience, especially inside the AC section
4
This became our 'local' for our three day stopover in Singapore. Fabulous little bar with good food and a lot of local interest. They even had a Happy Hour! Well worth a try if you are in the Clarke Quay area
3
Staff was not informed correctly on the promotions available. Food wise, average. If not for the bouncy castle, i will not patronise
4
We spotted this bar just across the road from our hotel, it was just what we needed at the end of a long day sight seeing.  We took advantage of the warm evening and sat outside. There was a good choice of beer and wine at a reasonable price. The staff were friendly and efficient.Our meals were good quality and arrived fairly quickly even though the bar was a little busy. Worth a visit if your in the area and cheaper than eating in a hotel
4
Great food, excellent n attentive services. The kids meal (burger) is rather small tho. We love the 1 for 1 promotions for the beer n cocktails. Cozy environment for family n friends gathering!
5
Nice chill out place for some nice food and light drinks. Service was exceptionally good, service staff was very attentive throughout.
3
This bar/cafe is fairly unassuming, catering to the usual happy hour crowd. Nothing very outstanding, but nothing to criticise too much either.
5
Good place with good drinks, a good place for hanging out with friends, so i think i will visit again
4
The elderly server at this outlet always provide fantastic customer service. The rest has a lot to learn from him. Drinks are value for money
4
They have a verandah looking out so it's quite a nice chill out atmosphere during lunch. Set lunches are value for money. Nothing to complain about
5
Pros;1. As my title -- wait staffs are excellent. Kudos to the gentleman with long hair forgot his name. Super friendly and knowledgeable.2. Price is absolutely reasonable. Go for "CRAZY MONDAY" beer and wine at SGD 6 with tax and service included.3. Ambiance -- music and ambiance are great. Get outdoor.4. Food quality are reasonable. Got Rib Eye steak 180gr. Pizza better at somewhere else.Cons;Might be the pizza quality, its not very filling and food charge consider is moderate [not that cheap]
3
My last visit before this past dinner in August was a couple years back, but I still recommended the place for dinner to my friends.The happy hour promo varies from branch to branch, but the one at UE Square offers a 1-for-1 that you can hold, which is definitely a great bonus for drinkers. Most of my friends enjoyed the food they ordered, save for one who had some things to say about his pizza for 1. I got the steak for myself, and requested for it to be medium-rare and served with salad and no fries. I was fine with the meat having been cooked more raw than medium-rare. However, it was served with fries and not the salad I had requested for. Fortunately, the server handled the situation quickly and effectively by giving me an additional side of salad. We ended up going somewhere else for more drinks after we had finished dinner that night, but you wouldn't be surprised seeing me there again for dinner. Maybe just not so soon
4
I thought District 10 would be just like any bar serving standard bland bar fare so I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of food. The fish bites came in nice bite sizes and we're so tasty all the kids asked for them. The batter was light and not overpowering. The tenderloin steak I ordered was perfectly done with an excellent quality. Even though we sat outdoors, it was so pleasant with a constant breeze blowing. A really nice place to chill out with a drink or two
5
Stopped here for a beer across road from hotel and were pleasantly surprised with the friendliness of the staff and cold beer. The staff jack/candy are extremely informative of their beautiful city and gave us a lot of information on what to see/where to go in our limited time in the city. Didnt have time to eat at this place but the food being served looked great. Happy hour is all day Tuesday to Sunday which means buy one get one free. Monday still has specials.
4
There is 1 for 1 for drinks till 8pm. Service is good. Near mrt which is convenient for everyone to meet.
5
The food is nice, not crowded for a Sat night.
Not noisy.
Nice Ambient.
Ordered Calamari, mashroom soup, Black Ink pasta and Cheese wheel Carbonara.
5
service staff was excellent.food was great and even entertainment for the kids on Sundays. overall it's a thumbs up for me
4
The food there was great, we ordered the homemade tagliatelle, linguine and bourbon flamed tomino cheese, they all taste great. Best of all, all Day 1 for 1 beer
5
Oferred me their signature boudon flame cheese with bread and it is super delicious even though it was slightly expensive.
2
Was full of anticipation after reading about good reviews of the restaurant. However, was greatly disappointed with the lack of service, especially when the restaurant was not crowded for a weekend lunch. The baby chair was also not clean that my friend had to bring their own stroller in to let their toddler sit in. The Cheese Wheel carbonara was also not impressive. Doubt I will return to the restaurant again
4
Went on a public holiday, which felt like a lazy weekend morning. Brunch was alright in terms of taste, quality and serving size. Kids' menu had decent variety. There a number of families with toddlers who used the small bouncy castle that looked a little worn out. Service was prompt
5
Hubby had the kurobuta pork chop and i had the angus beef burger both of which were absolutely fabulous. I asked to replace burger bun and fries with salad and they happily obliged :) This way i get to eat my burger without having to worry abt calories!
2
We had a whole bunch of kids but they didn't offer us the kids menu. Specifically asked for a non spicy aglio olio (and I reminded him on it again just before he walked off), yet it still came with chilli padi in it
4
This was our 'go to' restaurant in Singapore and we visited on three occasions. It was close to our accommodation, reasonably priced and the meals and service were very good. Diners can choose from the set menu option or a la carte. There was also the 2 for 1 drink option available during Happy Hour. The weekend menu is different from week days and is more informal with the sweet potato chips and club sandwiches a favourite. We went for breakfast on our final day in Singapore and found the place only opened at 11.30am so this became brunch. Not a problem.Service was very good and staff remembered us and even my special requirements when we visited the second time.A good experience and not typical for this type of franchise food outlet. Would recommend
5
The food and service was a great!!!!!!!!!!!!!
It's was my first time there, and the chesse wheel pasta which I saw online was so good.
3
Visited as we were staying over the road. Food was good: Italian cooked by Chinese. Prices a bit steep for the drinks. Two for one but one was expensive.
4
Have been to this restaurant very regularly. Food is always good. Managed to make it for the one for one wine which is great
5
Good food, good service. Hope for more variety. Pricing wise was a little bit steep but food was excellent. Maybe have more seating area as well.
4
Love the atmosphere here, good music n a good place to chill. The food was good n 1 for 1 pizza deal is definitely a good deal + $6 per alcohol on Monday.
4
Service was pretty good as staff was pleasant and attentive. Quite like the ambience on a weekday evening :) Food wise - I thought the cheese wheel pasta (carbonara) was like pretty nice but $26 for pasta, cheese and some bacon pieces isn't really worth the money. Overall still satisfied Thank you!!!
1
I visited the establishment on the eve of new year's on December 31st. I had traveled from the United States for a very short amount of time to visit the country and one of my goals was to try the famous cheese wheel pasta. My schedule was already stretched thin, so my fiancÃ© and I decided to pop in for lunch and try our luck. Colored me surprised when we arrived and got handed a brunch menu, with no cheese wheel pasta on sight. It took us a while to get the attention of our server and inquire about the dish. He brusquely said they didn't serve it until dinner. I still tried my luck and asked if an exception could be made (We've traveled so far, and really hoped to try it), but to no avail. We stayed and tried the brunch menu, but the food was not that great, and it took us forever to get service, the staff would take their time, even when we asked for our check to pay for the meal. They would even avoid looking at us so they didn't have to respond to our summons. Definitely didn't feel like going back later
3
The cheese wheel menu is a bit disappointing. The pasta is basically already cooked with cheese. They just transfer it onto the cheese wheel, mix a bit more of the cheese from the cheese wheel and that's it
3
The pizzas were delicious but the cheese wheel pasta was only average. I felt it wasn't cheesy enough but it is really dependent on personal preference
3
Party for 8We took the outdoor area to take advantage of the nice weather. Drinks are pricey but there was a good 1 for 1 promotion going on all night. Still it was pricey.Food: Average food. Some were good, such as the Goose Confit. Unfortunately, it wasn't very consistent in terms of seasoning. We had a late comer order the same dish and i think they forgot to season the mash potatoes and overcooked the meat till it was really dry.Service was mixed with room for improvement
3
Fuss free place to hangout with friends over food and drinks... Drinks were relatively cheap during happy hour..food was decent.
4
Cheese in a wheel was good however the serving is to little for the price. The staff are very friendly they serve almost instantly.
4
Had the wheel cheese pasta and risotto, which was a little disappointing as we forgot the cheese is cold, hence the pasta and risotto turned cold as well when we ate it. Otherwise the starter - calamari is yummy
3
Food was not as good as expectated. One time off visit. First and last experience. Food was salty. Not creamy enough for carbonara
3
Cheek wheel menu was so-so. Nothing special.food taste average. But ambience n service is good. Could be improved on the menu part.
1
to be honest, we didn't come expecting good food (more for the bouncy castle for the kids) but the quality was appalling. i think my helper can make better food than them. the one star was for the anti oxidant smoothie that was deliciousthe food were bland and cold. the milkshakes were watery. the service staff were clueless... when my husband complained about the quality of the food, our server actually said thank you. huh? did she actually understood his feedback?definitely not coming back although the kids loved the bouncy castle..
1
Kids excited to go to restaurant with bouncy castle. Unfortunately that's where the good news stopped. Food was bland and cold and my farmers breakfast was one of the worst fried breakfasts I have had in Singapore. .. and that's saying something. My wife's food (linguini) was better and the fresh fruit drinks were good. Needs to pull it's socks up.or become another irrelevant restaurant. Stick to being a bar
4
We visited this restaurant because of the cheese wheel, which is a huge cheese bowl where your pasta gets finished before it is served. The result is a yummy pasta very rich in cheese. We thought to order another meal that was not served in the cheese wheel otherwise it might be too overpowering and it was a great idea to do so - we ordered the chicken thigh with truffle fries and that was okay too. The homemade walnut cheese bread we ordered on the side was yum though
4
Travelling back to us, come across this bar/restaurant early this morning (10am Tuesday) fancied a look before our flight back to U.K. Arrived approx 14:30hrs, was advised limited menu but we both opted for the burgers & fries. (Very nice, great choice) great mid afternoon meal, followed by a couple of the 2-4-1 beers.. Service excellent & to be honest everything you could want as a couple or a group of friends for a great value afternoon..
2
Seriously have a bad experience with District 10, their staff is not attentive and rude. Food was good, but really disappointed with their service, I will not visit again
3
Had a birthday lunch there for my wife with the kids. Tried dishes from the cheese wheel menu and they were good! Just hoped the service was better, and our request during the reservation for a birthday surprise was ignored.
3
Lunch was great with good company. However food wise can be improved as not all items on the cheese wheel menu goes well with the cheese.
4
The pork chop was great size , tender and juicy. The tenderloin steak was equally yummy. Drinks were 1 for 1 before 8. No complaints at all!!
5
Convenient location, nice place, great food, excellent service! Always our first choice of gathering.
5
My friends and I were actually lookin at this please because we saw how delicious the brunch menu looked!! sadly we went on a weekday and their brunch menus are only available on public holidays or weekends :( Nonetheless we ordered some lunch menu items like the chickens wings and calamari m, which was soooo good, I couldn't get enough!! we ended with us getting a main dish each, which were the Angus beef burger, salmon steak and the pork chop!! I would recommend getting the beef burger because it was juicy and tender and packed a huge amount of flavour!! will definitely come back to this place again!
3
Did the usual Sunday brunch thing with kids. As usual a lot of families (mostly expats) were there for the Sunday brunch. It's a very family-friendly place with an area for children to play in. They have a decent kids menu, with most things at $9. Good service from the wait-staff (though the person who looked like the manager didn't sound friendly AT ALL). The food was somewhat mixed though: I tried the Philly cheese steak sandwich which was fine but the Mexican chicken wrap was a bit dry and mediocre
3
The restaurant did not receive the chope booking. They explained there is some back end disconnect that has happened a few times. Fortunately, the restaurant was not full and they managed to find seating for our party of 12. The burger and pizza is good. Beverage over priced.
5
Awesome is all I can stay...at a stone throw distance from fraser place hotel...the restaurant and a great vibe.. nice music, friendly waiter and the whole feel is amazing... we went late and ordered for grilled salmon and olive mushroom pizza... both the dishes were so flavourful..son gave 2 thumbs up and so do I...great place to stop by if in robertson quay..
1
I landed into Singapore late and needed a quick bite. Was recommended District 10 as it was close by. Service from waiting staff was great. The beer was great. The pizza was the worst pizza I have ever eaten, the base was soggy and the topping like rubber. I sent it back and was presented with the bill including the worst pizza in the world. I then had to argue with the person at the till to get it removed from my bill.
4
Client took me there for dinner after work , they took me here because it new and I am so used the other restaurants in Robinson road ... It's a great place to chill out for drinks and dinner after work , it's great course they have an outdoor area as well . The food was good as they serve tapas dishes also . My only comment will be the service could be better and slightly be more attentive . Beside that it's a real cool chill out place . Do check out the place as it place at the UE Square Mall .
4
Our condo was in the same building and on the way to the taxi stand...so we stayed there the whole Sunday afternoon and skipped our plans to go the beach at all. Nice small pizzas as specials and a lot of drink deals.
4
Came here with friends for brunch. Kids loved it coz of the bouncy castle and cars to play around. Never too busy, great location to get away from the crowds. Decent steak and coffee. Will be back again.
5
Great for event as when inviting many people. Sitting outside or inside. Lovely dishes and the Temderloin was just perfectly Grilled to Medium rare. Starter as dessert was all topquality
Lovely place
4
After a long and enjoyable day in Chinatown we didn't want to go far from UE Square for a meal so found this place. We enjoyed sitting outside under the fans in the light evening breeze. The staff gave us a friendly greeting and we were seated straight away. Mostly pizza and pasta dishes here, a few burgers also on the menu. The prices were ok, the have a range of pizzas at $10.17 ($12 nett with tax) that were a good size, I had the Beef Rendang pizza - very tasty. The Black Angus burger ($22)was also nice but my wife wouldn't have ordered it if she had known it was a mince burger, not fillet - assumed was a fillet after the waiter asked how she wanted it cooked. Overall a relaxing meal with efficient service. The only downside was due to there being a smoking area - if you must cater for smokers why have the seating configured in such a way that the smoker is almost in the middle of the seating area? I say banish them to the outer edges, making sure the wind blows the smoke away from, not through the diners
5
Although the music was pretty loud it had a good atmosphere at the outside tables. The burger costs 22 S$
5
A must for the welcome you get. They are very informative on Singapore, it is a relaxing spot to people watch, great service and friendly staff to talk to. Food and drink was great. It was very relaxed atmosphere in amongst all the frenzy of a city. We sat outside and it was a lovely sheltered area and thoroughly enjoyed it. Go visitors, its a must
2
I took a business associate here for a drink. We got nothing done. The music is too loud. The staff is intent on their smart phones. You'll have to do a Mexican wave to get their attention. I had an embarrassing experience over all. They share a restroom with the mall which means that you'll have to excuse yourself for at least 20 minutes.
4
We popped in here a few times as it was opposite the hotel we was staying in and thoroughly enjoyed it. We always sat outside and loved the 1 for 1 happy hour promotion. The Kronoburg Blanc was ideal and very refeshing in the heat of Singapore while the girlfriend loved trying the cocktails. Great quiet place to chill and relax while having a drink or three
2
A seriously grumpy face welcomed our arrival...is it any wonder the place was deserted by 9pm if senior service crew clearly don't want to be there?Also...if the kitchen truly closes at 9pm then why accept bookings online for as late as 1030pm?Anyway the steaks were acceptable...just...and with no mood to tackle dessert...we made a hasty exit...only to be denied the Chope 25% off discount promo for weekend reservations...despite it clearly being stated on the confirmation...Prior to dining here, I was intrigued to know why there is such a stark contrast in the size of the crowd here compared to the ever overflowing Wine Connection just across the road...guess I know now.
5
We didn't have to look far to find a great place to eat. Situated Opposite the Park Hotel Clarke Quay, district 10 bar and grill is a great place to grab lunch or tea. Main food menu is available after 5:30pm but there is lunch menu before available. We had the margarita pizza $16 to start which was delicious and had the 180g black angus beef tenderloin $26 where the beef was cooked to absolute melt in your mouth perfection. The chips were good and the pepper sauce had lots of flavor and right amount of bite.We had eaten a steak dish at a local Italian restaurant the night before where we paid $38 and it was disgusting.We usually aren't much for alcohol beverages as they seem to be quite expensive in Singapore but they offered a 2for price of 1 on selected beers and wine and mocktails which was good. All in all very enjoyable and we would recommend for sure.
4
Quite good brunch on Sunday but pricey. Beware that service charge is included but they still give a receipt where a tip is optional which is, in my opinion, underhand.
5
The food was very good and presentation very classy. I went back a second night just because the service and food was so good.
4
Nice embience, nice stuffs, nice food. Price is reasonable. My husband and my son love the place too.
3
The pastas were excellent. There was a 1-for-1 pasta deal with citibank credit card. Burratina wasn't exactly the way I liked it and the steak was disappointing. Mushroom soup wasn't how I remembered it should be from another restaurant by the same chefs.
5
Great burgers, cold beer and good service. Nice place to go for a quick bite with a nice atmosphere. We had a good server and prompt service.
4
We had dinner here one night after being unable to decide what we wanted to eat. The menu is very restaurant/bar food so if you are after a slice of Singapore, this is not the place for you. That said, the food was very nice and the burger really yummy
5
Living in beside this place so decided to call in last night for food and a few pints. I had the asahai black beer, beautiful pint and also good price. I had the duck spring rolls, simple but so so tasty. A lovely atmosphere here and staff are so polite aswell. Really would recommend this bar and I will most certainly be back.
4
We found this little place at Clarke Quay in Singapore. We enjoyed the platter for two and a small hamburger. Had really good drink specials - 2 for 1 so spent a bit of time here. Even treated to the belly dancer from Persian restaurant adjacent to here. Good cheap feed and good service
5
I came here last night and it was wonderful! The staff was so friendly and helpful. We ordered a few drinks and I ordered a warm lava cake with vanilla icecream and it was all delicious! A little pricey but as should be expected when in Singapore. I will certainly revisit!
4
We stopped here after a pointless city tour for some food. We were disappointed to find that only pizza and salads were available. We opted for pizza was was very good. Happy hour was on so we had a couple of drinks. The service was good and the location was handy for our hotel.
5
Great food with a great atmosphere.
A great menu to choose from to cover all tastes. Very handy if you are staying near UE Square Mall.
5
Almost everything here taste very delicious.the foie grass is very very delicious.the spaghetti is also very delicious..a must try restaurant.the wine selection here is also good with a bar outside for drinking and smoking and chatting with friends...the bread is also tasty
4
Their wagyu beed steak, salmon steak, cod steaks are all pretty amazing ... cost of food and drinks is pretty average, about SGD20+ and upwards. Great ambience for a quick drink, discussion or catchup with friends!
5
Had a night out with friends and must say great service by the Manager, food came out really fast and really affordable!! My next fav diner in Singapore!
5
The ambience is great with nice lights, good décor and attentive service. The waiters and waitresses got all the orders to the right people (not just table mind you). Will definitely revisit!
3
The bread was nice. Being vegetarian- I had some spaghetti dish- not so nice. But took note to bring husband, a steak lover, here.
3
Location of this bar is amazing as I like sitting outside, food wise was very average had pasta and the prices a little extra. They only have ahsasi beer on tap which is sad. Service was friendly enough. Good spot for meeting with fiends sitting outside
5
We were staying in the Park Avenue Apartments UE square on Clemenceau Ave and this restaurant / bar is under these apartments. We walked past this place a dozen times... Silly us. We eventually came in and wound up eating there more than often. The food is OUTSTANDING and very reasonably priced. What more to say...?
3
Had dinner with eight of us on Saturday evening. Arrived just near Happy hour ending so got in some happy hour drinks which they were happy to hold for us and overall the staff were very good, although it was quiet.Food wise I thought was pretty basic fair, I had some Salmon Steak which was again basic, piece of Salmon on some mashed potatoe with few string beans so not much to write home about.Found entrees to be best item on menu.Nice area to sit outside and easy walk to Robertson Quay after dinner as well which help
4
Tried their branch at Winstedt Road long time ago, they moved to UE2 and it is good to know they still have the crispy goose leg confit which had became my fave dish. Good selection of wines with reasonable price range. Not to forget they show live EPL matches
4
I ordered their New Year eve set dinner. The Spaghettini Tossed with Tiger Prawns and Atlantic Scallop in garlic white wine sauce was so delicious. The rest of dishes are OK but still have standards.
4
The staff were all great and the food whilst Western was pretty good. It was a busy place and had a good wine selection. I had the rib-eye which was cooked to perfection.
4
Ambiance is good. Recommended for dating.
Beef can be improved. (was done medium rare when we ordered medium)
4
We had dinner at this establishment.
Food was excellent, service was fine, pricing comparable to the Quays area.
1
made a reservation thru phone for a grp of 20 few days ago. i requested for 06 baby chairs and was told rudely that i can only hv 02. when we arrived today, i spoke to a young guy person wearing all black regarding the baby chairs and his rude reply was 'we got plenty of baby chairs dun worry!' thru-out our meals, he was showing us very bad service, ignoring our request for water and giving us the 'irritated look' everytime we speak to him. my msg to him, 'if you are so unhappy, take a day off and do not turn up for work'! i will not step in again because there are plenty of cafes with better food and excellent service.
4
District 10 is a good place for a drink and a light snack. I had some beers and fish and chips which were quite tasty. Clark Quay is very busy so from your table you can watch the world go by, no water view mind you but there will be a sea of bodies!!
4
Popped in here more than once during my time in SG. The staff were friendly and the lunch menu had a variety of food styles to choose from. 1 for 1 seemed to be on most of the time and Kronenberg Blanc on tap made my day
3
brunch was what we wanted and having a kid around, we definitely wanted a children-friendly restaurant, thus we set for District 10 which offers the best of both world. the place was filled with only a couple of patrons when we were there. The most unfriendly experienced that welcomed us was when my friend came by with a drink in his hand, and he was told off by the service, which we told they could exercise more flexibility in this manner. food was normal, nothing to shout out but we wished the food was served warmer. also the brunch menu can be more extensive.the bouncy castle went deflated while some children were there, and fortunately not when my friend's kid (1 year plus old) went in. some kids were rather rowdy. overall not much to shout out, and wish that the food can be better.
2
Just there now.. With two friends and my roast chicken dish came like 12 min after all my friends dishes cameAsked for the bill and wanted to break a 50 dollar bill and the guy was unfriendly.. He was unfriendly to us but friendly to the young ladies around me.. His nails were ridiculously longEven getting water took us many times to holler at the wait staff to get The chicken dish wasn't too bad though .. Just hope staff could be more responsive
4
This very small restaurant is situated in Clarke Quay in one of the arcades (not on the riverside). Ruzzle, our lovely waitress, was a great salesperson so we took up the 2 for 1 fish and chips for $8.90 on offer as a Sunday night special. We had enjoyed a late lunch so this was a good option for us. They had Singapore Slings for $SGD16 and a 2 for 1 Stella so was a very economical evening with friendly service. We went back the next night for hamburgers and took advantage of 2 for 1 Mojitos at $SGD16. On our final night we dropped in for Singapore Slings. They are great value compared to other venues such as Raffles. Ruzzle provided excellent service once again as my husband left his bag and 50 metres from the restaurant when he realised, Ruzzle came running up behind us with the bag. In summary, good pub food, friendly service and great price
2
Very expensive drinks and did not get our order right twice. The service was ok but they did not have strong english which let them down.
4
Tenderloin and ribeye both very tasty. Price's reasonable Good for casual dining. Waiters helpful, happy to flip the obligatory TV over for us to watch the F1 racing!
4
happy hours, drought beer. doesn't get any better.. and flat price pizzas.... good spot to hit for a beer or two after work..
4
Found this the last night in Singapore... Great food,wine and service. Staff are wonderful too.Price are reasonable, very laid back relaxing place to spend a night......
4
District 10 is one of our regular places to grab a few drinks after work and somewhere that you inevitably end up bumping into someone you know. Occasionally, if we’re feeling peckish, we’ll have dinner there as well, the mini cheese burgers are delicious! We’ve since heard that District 10 has opened up 2 more venues, which doesn’t surprise us in the least, the atmosphere is warm and welcoming, the drinks are reasonably priced and the food is always tasty
4
Originally called into District 10 Bar & Restaurant for a few cleansing ales after a day spent sightseeing. Excellent choice of beers and with the 2 for 1 happy hour, very good value for money. As with most bars we experienced in Singapore, the beer is served a couple of degrees warmer than what we are accustomed to in Australia. Service was excellent, so much so that we went back for dinner later that night. Once again, attentive service that was not in your face. Entrees and mains were excellent and served promptly

Had dinner at the Buona Vista Dinner 10 tonight. Very good value happy meal drinks, two red wines for $13++. A pleasant Chilean Cab Sav. Took the 5 starters for $25 and liked them all, particularly the chicken skewers. Kids had Angus cheeseburgers which were very well cooked. We shared a duck salad. Service very attentive and friendly. Nothing outstanding but overall very pleasant and would go there again. Around S$ 130 including four glasses of red. Outside terrace was quiet this night and would recommend

This bar was located directly across from our hotel and i think we drank here twice almost every day, including in that we had food a few times, the service was brilliant, staff always having a chat, would definatly recommend here and it was great seeing it busy each day, thank you for making us feel welcome, paul and michel

We visit here often and I really do recommend their mini cheeseburgers. They are really tasty and coming in two per serving, they are great to share along with other small items. The last time we were there, we shared the rocket and pear salad, which was really good, the shoe string fries, which were delicious and the chicken wings, which were fine, but would prefer them without a sort-of batter

I went to District 10 Bar & Restaurant for drinks vaguely before they moved to the new address, when they were still situated at Newton area. Today, I re-visited for brunch at their new location at 81 Clemenceau Avenue #01-15 / 16 / 17 UE Square Shopping Mall, Singqapore 239917 and the number to dial is 6738 4788.The interior of District 10 Bar & Restaurant is sleek, contemporary and of rustic European design, complete with exquisite wood furniture of eco-friendly nature. The cosy, relaxed ambience brings comfort to diners but unfortunately the inside is fully-reserved.Hence, we decided to sit by the lovely and breezy open-concept bar area, outdoors. It was spacious and I felt more exhilarated somehow, able to do people watching and enjoying the kiss of morning sun.My Fried Eggs with bacon, mushrooms, roasted tomato, hash brown, vegetables and chicken chipolata sausage (SGD$14.00) was served first. I like eggs for brunch as I believe them to be nutritious - fried or not. Morever, the combination of egg-yolks smeared over my bread slice, tucked in with sauteed mushrooms and sourish tomatoes or crispy hash browns, was simply irresistable. The taste was overwhelmingly delicious, my idea of a perfect brunch.Celine* had the Creamy Scrambled Eggs (SGD$14.00) version of my breakfast - served with muffin, oriental mushrooms, hash brown and roasted tomatoes as well. Another sumptuous brunch of differentiating textures and tastes, hers was more unique with the acquired flavor of spring onion in the egg, giving it an interesting boost of aroma.For more detailed information and photos, please feel free to pop by:http://thearcticstar.blogspot.sg/2014/04/brunch-at-district-10-bar-restaurant.htm

This place was great. The food, while pricey, were worth it. They had real mashed potatos which I've missed while being an expat. Everything we had was delicious.

We often stop here for a drink, but we decided to eat here as well two nights ago and both my husband and I ordered steaks. I ordered the 180g beef tenderloin and my husband ordered the more expensive beef strip loin (I think that is what it was). My steak was perfect - tender, juicy and cooked to perfection. My husbands was also good but we agreed that mine was probably better. Excellent value for a really good steak

I fell for not asking the terms and conditions of Happy Hour. I bought a couple of Corona's but when settling up I noticed that the beers listed for Happy Hour were written in a smaller font and typically the ones no one likes. The atmosphere was good, the service was OK (just) and my wife's G&T was great but I walked away feeling I had been slighted. Given there are many bars in Robertson and Clarke Quay, I won't be returning and I won;t be recommending

Casual Al Fresco dining with very loud electronic dance music. The volume of the DJ's sound might explain why we had to order one of the dishes 3 times until we succeeded. 4 months ago it was still casual and cool. Now it's a watering hole with a touch of a dance or trance underground disco.

For more reviews, visit my blog at ms-skinnyfatIf you frequent the Robertson area, you would probably have seen or heard about District 10 at UE Square. My impression was that it is a cool bar that does drinks and the usual bar grub and hence it piqued my curiosity when i was invited to brunch by the nice folks at District 10.When i stepped into the restaurant, i noticed that the decor has changed. The place is now bigger, brighter and certainly classier. We had the District 10 Eggs Benedict ($16). I was a little confused because they turned out to be Eggs Florentine. Anyhow, lovely poached eggs on fluffy toasted muffins with a nice crisp on the outside. I found that the hollandaise sauce was well balanced with the flavors from the sautéed spinach and smoked salmon.We had the interesting Pandan Coconut Pancake with Gula Melaka Syrup ($9) which tasted like the traditional Malay kuehs. The pancakes are on the dense and chewy end with crispy shredded coconut on top (the browned parts). I couldn't stop soaking the pancakes into the brown sugar syrup. Lovely. But only if you like kueh.Next, we moved on to the heavier items. The Hoegarden Battered Fish & Chips with mint mushy peas and tartare sauce ($22). The fish was satisfactory crisp but had its limelight stolen by the amazing natural cut fries. Hell they can be a main on their own. Love the salty batter! The District 10 Brunch Beef Burger ($20) comes paired with the fries too. Hooray! Charcoal-grilled Black Angus patties topped with fried egg, crispy back bacon, cheddar cheese on a sesame bun. You can never go wrong with the egg bacon cheese combination but i thought the patty was a little dry. Well, at least you know they don't use unknown cow bits in this one. Do not miss the thin crust pizzas by Italian Chef Luca Pezzera. Love the crust that crackles with each bite. The Portobello Mushrooms pizza ($26) with Portobello mushrooms and a generous serving of truffle oil on top was earthy and delicious.For something with a local twist, there's the Wagyu Beef Cheek Rendang pizza ($29). The meat was flavorful but somehow it was very gelatinous. The sauce however was pretty spot on for an Italian creating a local favorite. Thumbs up to Chef Luca but could we have more toppings please

We are foie gras lovers and always looking at French food in Singapore. We did not expect so much from district 10 since it rather looked like a trendy bar than a gourmet restaurant. However we went to try it as we live next door, and to our surprise we had an exquisite yet simple dinner. The foie gras ravioli and the burrata starter were outstanding, everything was tasty, the meat and the pan seared foie gras were perfectly cooked. Given the location we thought the food equaled any gastronomic restaurant for a reasonable price. I went to find the chef (Italian btw) to give my positive feedbacks, he was grateful and asked me to write a review here which is what I am doing now. He fully deserved it.

Just been for dinner at this really nice place. The location of the bar/restaurant may not be to everyone's taste as it sits on the edge of a mall facing a main. All the same for a small group of us it was a nice place to meet. After a couple of drinks at the bar we were shown to the private room which just about fitted 10 of us. We had a fixed menu starting with beef carpaccio on a bed of rocket leaves. It was very tasty. The came angel hair pasta with truffle oil. Beautiful and cooked to perfection. The main course was sea bass, grilled and served with a lemon butter sauce (the sauce was a little on the heavy side - non the less I finished my helping). Cheesecake for dessert and a perfect espresso capped a wonderful meal. Not sure how this compares with the a la carte menu but it is enough to get me to go back. Oh, and the service was exemplary.

We were surprised to be told that daily specials and set lunches can only be eaten outdoors! We could have done a double take out of the F&B outlet but we didn't cos we were set to try the $12 nett grilled salmon with mashed potato in white wine! We were also pretty tired, hot and hungry and had to rush back to see to the final touches for the Award Ceremony to be held at the nearby 100-year old temple! Food was good but service can be better! Guess we didn't qualify on the list of good diners! My colleague had to get the waiter and we had to chase for the bill. Not the place if you are rushing somewhere and want a quick and reasonably-priced meal

I would rate this good actually but the rating does not allow this. After a light dinner, we looked forward to chilling on a saturday night and found District 10 @ Star Vista. Outdoor area had a better atmosphere and a resident dj was spinning the latest pop and from the 90s. Too bad we already ate because there was a variety of food offered for a wine bar. We settled on multiple orders of the truffle fries which was really good - crisp at the edges and fluffy tasting cuts. Our wine choices were on the happy hour list which was until 8pm at SGD8/glass (chardonnay) and also chose from their wide range of wine offering not on happy hour list from SGD15/glass for sauvignon blancs. The price for 3 pax with 5 glasses wine and truffle fries was almost SGD100. Seems a little pricey with happy hour thrown in but hey, the restaurant's name would suggest otherwise if it was not called D10! Good ambience even for families with kids below 10

Bar was across the road from hotel, staff were very attentive. They have specials for everyday and happy hours. Drinks were reasonably priced. can even order tea and coffee and other non-alcoholic drinks. They also serve food which we didn't get a chance to try, but they look good from other tables

Right next to the entrance of the mall, smells of left over cigarette butts, stella is flat two thirds of the way down. Haven't and don't think that I'll try the food so can't comment.

D10 serves up decently priced beer, wine and food in a convenient and pleasant location. Service is always good as Chef Luca runs a tight ship. As part of the Bonta group, some often have much higher expectations of the food but one should always remember the budget and level the place is aimed at. There's definitely a place for the likes of D10 in the market whether it be for a quick bite or a more leisurely experience. The widescreen TV also makes it a decent spot to watch sport

Outdoor and indoor seating close to Robertson Walk, nice atmosphere. Waiters are slow and not paying attention, food comes in 15 min so fine. Quality is poor for the 30 S$ I got really below par 200 gram Ribeye, and it was medium versus rare ordered.

Eggs Florentine has been a favourite brunch find for me and over the years I have been hunting down every eggs florentine in the country. However that being said, District 10 honestly serves up some of the best Eggs Florentine I have ever tasted, the classic runny egg, rocket salad, large roasted tomato all on an English Muffin. It even packs in a special surprise HOWEVER if you are allergic to nuts, please avoid it. Don't be disappointed though the huge array of fusion food as well as classic tapas makes District 10 a place you want to keep returning to, the food atmosphere and staff are great and on hand and the music is just right for the whole feel of the place. Excellent

Great find across the road from our average hotel! Amazing burgers, great happy hour ( for Singapore ) and friendly staff!

They've obviously hired blind waiters atthis place cause they definitely ddon't see the customers. They are either too busy checking their phones or talking, or it just seem like you're ruining their day for being a customer. Expect a 30 minutes wait to have a top up on your drink, food is ok in this place and it is a great location. Too bad the service suck.

On a recent business trip I walked down to Clarke Quay and found this little place tht has plenty happening where i could grab a beer and a feed. It's a great mix between bar and restaraunt, with quality food that allows you Time to soak in the ambiance whilst getting a meal quickly that is delicious. I had the petite angus BBQ burgers. They were delicious and right on the money. Sure there are hundreds of options in the immediate vicinity, but If they have what you're looking for I'd say sit relax and enjoy

Went to the Star Vista outlet last weekend and took my son who was visiting town. It implied it was Spanish however only a few Spanish influences such as the Bar tapas. Fortunately I was advised that the steak was reasonably good and it proved a good choice and my sons partner had the pizza which was also okay. It tries to please everyone with a diverse menu and perhaps we would go back again and see whether other menu items measure up given steak and pizza is hardly culinary expertise. Worth a visit by those looking for somewhere to tr

Very average tasting and petite serving of fish and chips and District 10 at Clarks Quay.Next time would definitely try something else. My order came with a bottle of Stella (which I personally like a lot), but at 17 SGD ++, not a very good deal, especially since it included only 1 piece of fish and about 15 fries (which were good, just not enough).The only nice thing I have to say is when I asked for them to serve me wasbi-mayo in addition to the tartar sauce, I wasn't charged extra

Another wanna be restaurant that doesn't make it. If you just go to the bar for a drink, little can go wrong (unless the bottle top flies into your eye as the Barman tries to impress with his bottle opening skills...)We were a table of 4, 2 Adults and 2 Kids on a Sunday evening. Place approx. 20 % full. Sherwin ( our Waiter according to the bill receipt ) took the order. We ordered Crab Cake $19; Black Angus Trio of Burgers $19; Fish Fritters $13 and Duck Confit $26. Originally I wanted to order the Cold Cut Platter but Sherwin advised me that if I wanted some Bread with it I had to pay an additional $6 ! Bearing in mind that I can buy 2 Loaves for that I was put off right away. Anyone with half an idea about Continental Food & Beverage knows that you serve cold cuts I.e. Salami, Ham, Pâtés etc. with Bread. That message has not yet arrived at District 10 but not to worry, across the road is the Wine Connection which serves excellent Charcuterie and Cheese Platters and guess what...it comes with bread and butter where you can put the stuff on it ! Sherwin impressed us during order taking by not having to take any notes. Clearly a well trained and seasoned Hospitality Professional that can memorize an order for a table of 4. Well so we thought. He can back two times to clarify the order, presumably as he had forgotten what we wanted non the way to the Owrdering station. After we had ordered effectively 3 times, my Stella Artois arrived, unfortunately not in Pint form as I ordered. No problem it was changed swiftly.The food came. The Crab Cakes should be called Crap Cakes. The 3 pieces were dry and very acidic, a clear sign that the crabmeat came out of a can. For $19 you are better off using them as break pads for your car. The 3 mini Burges looked nice and they were well done.....no I don't mean we'll done in good but well done in overcooked, solid hard no more juice in it.......maybe that Black Angus was an old Cow? Again for $19 you can get 3 humongous Burgers at Burger King and they give you Fries with it! The Fish Fritters were good, no really they were good and so was the Tartar Sauce. $13 is pricey for the portion and again no Fries or anything but at least was edible.The Duck Confit was a good portion and the meat was Tender. If the Skin had been crispy as it is meant to be I would have given it a 8 out of 10 but the skin was flabby so sorry only a 3 for abusing a perfectly good product. To finish off this highlight of a Culinary Experience we ordered a scoop of Vanilla Ice and a scoop off Chocolate Ice Cream for the Kids. The Ice Cream wasn't Haagen Dazs (We know HD as we eat it by the tub...) and the size of the scoop was resembling a Golfball. Not a problem in itself but at $6 per scoop (++ of course) you do feel ripped off. To add insult to injury on their Website they are promoting a 10% discount for Amex Cards. I did pay with Amex but no discount was given but then again I presume for D10 the onus is on the customer to ask rather then extending automatically what they are promoting to attract custom.I wish them good luck for the future - they need it
