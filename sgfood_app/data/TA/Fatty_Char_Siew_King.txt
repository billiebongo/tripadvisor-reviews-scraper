WORTHPls come down and try for yourselvesAunty is also very nice!!! $4 for the signature noodle (4/5 stars for this- normal & yummy noodles) with the most delicious Char Siew. If you love fatty meat U HAVE TO TRY THIS! Fried wonton is also good.Give it a try if you are around the area, or travel down just for this- you won't regret.....

One of the best wanton noodles I've eaten for awhile in Singapore. The lady boss makes the char siew herself using 不见天 (the standard meat used), as well as the more expensive 五花肉 if you prefer. She's very friendly and will be more than willing to tell you about why she came into this business. (just started 4 months) $3 per bowl.She also takes order for roast pork ribs. All pork used are Indonesian pork. She uses pork lard for her noodles. Yum yum!IMO, it sure beats queueing up for the famous mince pork noodles a few shops away. Location: Food court beside Heap Seng Leong kopitiam. In the same kopitiam (coffeeshop) as 正味卤面
