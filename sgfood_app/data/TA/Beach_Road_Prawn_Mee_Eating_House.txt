It took 5,8sgd for this meal (prawn noodles). Not so delicious but not bad, the taste is a bit like Cao Lau noodle in Hoi An - VN. Very crowded, shouldnâ€™t come at 12am.
4
Good prawn noodles and ngoh hiang, but have to go early before the large prawns get sold out. Always with long queues, have to find parking nearby, but worth the wait.
4
Although the standard has dropped, it is still better than many other places. Have your noodles with the Five Spices Pork roll, it compliment each other very well. Main problem here is getting car parking.

Prawn Mee is a challenge to prepare. The stock is most crucial and it can screw up your bowl of prawn mee very quickly. Beach Road Prawn Mee is very well done. The soup while tasty and fragrant is not over-salted and has the smell of the sea. The prawns are fresh and succulent. Try also the pig-tail. Some say it's full of collagen

Recently, my husband, some Singaporean friends and I visited Singapore's Beach Road Prawn Mee Eating House for Sunday Lunch. This is not fancy dining, but the food is good. A bowl of noodles, jumbo prawns (very fresh), soup with dried onion sprinkled on top. Dining is alfresco; seating is with simple stools and small folding tables. You order at the counter from a limited menu...not too complicated for the novice. Prices are reasonable with a small bowl costing under 6SGD. If you are new to Singapore with limited time, I recommemd arriving and departing by taxi as parking can be a problem and it is not close to any MRT station. Taxis are readily available in this area. So, for a bit of local Singapore flavour visit Beach Road Prawn Mee Eating House.Located at: 370 E Coast Rd, Singapore 428981Operating Hours: Wed-Mon 7:30am-4pm. Closed on Tue

First time here and quite amazed with the prawn mee or prawn noodle. Tasty and quite light for a bowl of noodles. We had it with some fried stuffs from the Ngo Hiang stall at the same spot. This place very busy during morning time for people having breakfast here.
5
It's one of the best prawn noodles in town! I enjoyed the fragrant and flavourful soup so much that I cleared out the bowl! There is a prawn fritter counter in the same vicinity - and it's wonderful to be eaten paired together with the prawn noodle. A must try for tourists!
4
Its in 2 shophouses, no air conditioning and sits are limited. One has to line up to order. One line for the prawn noodle ranging from $4 to 8.80 a bowl to another stand where they sell Singapore style prawn cake and other types of small dishes. Singaporean favourites! Its a place to go for the prawn noodle. Not much parking space and one has to wait for your turn to eat. It's all worthwhile once you taste the food. Take number 2 where one has 3 pieces of prawn and pork ribs in bowl of noodles soup
4
I had the pork rib dry noodles. A small bowl cost $5.80. The chili sauce is good but the pork ribs could have been more tender. The noodles has to go hand in hand with the prawn fritters, stall next to it and wash down with a glass of lime juice. Staffs taking orders are not friendly with a long face. It is closed on Tuesdays. Anyway, if you have cravings for a good bowl of noodles, this is it
5
My first time here with my spore friends. Ordered the Big prawn mee. The broth was so good & the prawn was huge & fresh. Very tasty. Went there around 10ish so less crowds. The fried Ngor Hiang were nice too. It's a must try food in Spore if u hve a car or grab a taxi
3
An above-average prawn noodles. Garlic-tasting soup. Good? Yes. Fantastic? No.
Coffee-shop needs a renovation. A place like this could do with a little improvement given their fame.
Tip: The Ngoh Hiang beside them is pretty good too.
4
Have been eating there for the past 4 years.. standard dropped over the years. The prawn noodles goes with the äº”é¦™ã€‚still above than average prawn noodles I have tried in singapore.
4
Order the king prawn noodles and you will not regret.
The soup is rice and nice (little MSG) and the prawns are fresh.
Prices are affordable too.
5
I usually go to this place on Sundays for family lunch and the food down there is amazing like when I mean amazing I mean literallly amazing the prawns are so fresh and delicious would highly recommend this place for both breakfast and lunch
4
Very delicious Prawn Noodles. We feel that it is a little over-priced. Service not very friendly.
Very crowded, warm & long wait during lunch time.
4
Had breakfast here on Dec 25, 2016.
Staff courteous and helpful.
Go for the Jumbo Prawn Mee with the white rice noodles. The place opens at 7.30 am, even weekends. 10 mins from airport.
5
very tasty prawn noodle soup is something you cannot afford to miss on the east coast of Singapore. Affordable price, decent portion of prawns/noodles. Small size bowl for kids should be enough but adults should go for medium size bowl or bigger. Closed on Tuesdays and very often they run out of stock especially on weekends late afternoon.
5
Not the friendliest place in Singapore, but.....they make up for it with flavour and taste. The bowl was amazing. BRING YOUR OWN TISSUES!!! The place was packed and ordering was quite simple as the menu is straight forward, 3-4 choices and 3 sizes. Make no mistake, this is a must go when in Singapore
4
It's probably the most infamous prawn mee in Singapore. All the other review already says a lot about how it taste. Now here's a few tips for first timers:1. The line will be crazy during lunch time, avoid regular lunch time if possible. Have an early or late lunch.2. If you're visiting with a friend, ask them to find a seat first while you're on the line. The cashier will ask your table number when you're ordering3. Don't forget to try the fried ngohiang stall. Located at the same location. Will be a perfect dishes to have while waiting your prawn mee.4. It's gonna get messy with the noodle and the broth. I would recommend you not to wear white (if you're a messy eater) - and don't forget to bring your own klenex. (They don't provide any)Hope the tips help you get the most of the prawn me

This morning visited Beacb Road Prawn Noodles Eating House located along East Coast Road oppisite Caltex Station near junction of Still Road. Limited parking space along Telok Kurau Road (near Peranakan Hotel). 3 minutes walk to the shop.Find a table before proceeding to cashier counter to place order with table number. Make payment and await food to be served. Queueing time about 5-7 minutes.Fresh big prawn and yellow noodles in thick soup. Cost little more but really appetising and tasty. Enjoyed
4
Its a large kopitiam with not much more than prawn noodles and ngor hiang. Service is prompt, turnover is quick, with large local clientele and efficient staff
4
Good experience, returning to an old favorite joint, for umpteen years. Still as delicious; might be better with less sugar and/or MSG. But, these are necessary evils to keep the customers returning.
4
Everytime we visit singapore, my parents will never missed to eat at this place. The prawn noodle is yummy and the soup is really tasty. The fried food just beside the prawn noodle stall is also superb. Always full with people.
3
Used to be my first choice for prawn noodles but the last two visits prove that standard drop drastically. Not worth the price anymore and the soup is not as fragrant as before. Quite ordinary now
4
simply love the soup ( it's thick n flavorful ) n the fresh n juicy prawns. never fails to put on a smile on my face ðŸ˜Š while waiting for your noodles u might as well also order some ngoh hiong.
4
We were staying at a hotel near this area and were out exploring when we found this place. We remembered that relatives had taken us there a couple of years ago. So we tried it again. I enjoyed the dish very much, but my wife, originally from Singapore, felt it wasn't traditional enough. She felt the soup base was too thick, the prawns too big and unshelled and there was no pork meat in it. Given that, I didn't notice exactly leaving anything in her bowl, so she liked it, just didn't love it. I, on the other hand, being the typical American that I am, didn't know anything about the history of the dish. I just knew it tasted very good. So, my 5 star rating and her 3 star rating gets averaged to a 4 star rating.But just between you and me, it's quite good
5
This is the local prawn noodle joint in the eastern part of Singapore. Not your typical clean air-conditioned restaurant; guests eat in the open air. Tables and floor could be dirty, with occassional flies. But the soup is tasty and prawn served in large portion. Sometimes popular with expats living nearby and the courageous tourists. No subway station. Reacheable by cab or bus. A good once-off experience for visitors. I came here with my Indonesian business partners who loved every inch of it
5
This remains my favorite prawn noodles in the East. The soup is thick and noodles is very 'Q'. The side dish (from another store) adds variety to the dining experience here. Parking is a challenge but if you don't mind parking a bit far away, then there is no issue.
4
For me this is still one of the best authentic prawn mee in Singapore. In the old days this is served with sliced prawn and pork with well fried park lard. I don't like the big prawn. This place still served with the small slice prawn (which I prefer - pic attached) but without the sliced pork. This is only available in the morning and they are out out this by late morning. So you have to go early if you prefer the sliced prawn. They actually open @ 7:00 and not 8:00 as indicated on their website. ENJOY
4
Friends had been meaning to take me here and when our breakfast plans freed up, we made a run to this East Coast (20 minutes from downtown/Orchard Road) family restrautn that serves food all day. Must have the Prawn Mee (Noodle Soup) that comes in various sizes. Well priced and family style provides good quantities. You won't be disappointed if you can make it out here. Good luck and enjoy
3
Honestly i don't like the prawn noodle but the side dish like ngoh hiang and other fried snack is nice however the back log is the price where i feel a bit pricy... Taste and portion getting smaller and not that up to previous standard...
5
Sudden craving for prawn noodles so here I am... long Q and crowded even though past lunch hour at 2pm. Very nice. If driving parking abit of a problem and need to walk across the road . Worth the visit for a very local food
5
This is where locals come for their favorite Singaporean prawn noodles. Order the big prawn noodle soup for maximum effect!
Highly recommended!
4
We've been here a few times and the noodles are always yummy. Especially the dry noodles with prawn and pork ribs. You can also get indian rojak in the same shop, which is good too.
3
My Singaporean friend took us for lunch in this store. Could not really consider this is a restaurant, but locally rather famous for its big prawn noodle in soup. To me, only so so, it is named as one of the best in Singapore by the locals. Seatings and dinning surroundings not very comfortable, long benches and stool, quite open, so quick lunch is okay. This is the 2nd time I tried this, still to me, nothing so special
3
Was really looking forward this meal, after not eaten here for a year. Unfortunately the umami flavor of their once famous soup seems diluted, missing the punch of sweetness.Noticed that the prices went up (but to be fair, inflation affected everyone). However was really disappointed by the portion and taste.Sigh... this is another long time favorite gone with the progress of time
5
Great recommendation by my cousin. Located in a shop house, very busy with lunch crowd as there was a Q. We did not wait too long for our noodle. The rich soup base very flavorful. They ran out of big prawns nonetheless the medium size ones were just as good. There is a Ngo Hiiang äº”é¦™ stall which is also another SG fav. Good compliment to our noodle.
3
When with wife for Lunch prepare to have a short Q....during Lunch hours.Service was fast.We order Prawn with Pork Rib & Prawn with Pig Tail.Soup was warm only not Hot & yellow Noodle was a little Al Dente a little disappointed. East Coast Ngo Huang was Great with their super sauce.The stall inside prawn shop.Their standard remain their Chilli sauce have greatly improve . Below Pictures.
1
Have been a regular visitor . Standard dropped over the years . Although better than average prawn noodle in singapore, cashier is rude and arrogant. Even with good food , i believe service is an important aspect in the F&B industry . Good luck to the business 
5
Been here many times. They serve the freshest prawn in town. They are closed on tuesday. So take note.Buy the medium size or large size bowl. The small ones just aint that great, and not worth the money and visit. Personal preference is medium sized.You may add noodles at a cost, and top up your soup for free. Do request for fried onion with added soup
3
The soup is not bad and doesn't seem to be heavy on MSG. However, price is on the high side as the lowest priced is SGD5.50 and there are only two prawns sliced in half. I would not recommend a trip specially for it.
4
A very popular place with great Prawn Mee. Nothing fancy but good food and a good price. Anytime in Singapore we try and eat here.
4
This is one of the good Prawn Noodle in Singapore . Parking is a big problem as there is not enough. Food is good but a but pricy
4
The prawn noodles is good and although they have increased their prices, I still find it quite worth it. Decent place with good food.
5
A Non air-conditioned traditional restaurant in the East of Singapore. They serve ngoh hiang(äº”é¦™)(five spice) as well. it's a dish that comprises of various meats and vegetables.awesome broth, prawn and noodles with option of adding pork ribs as well.these are going for 5.80 a bowl at it's lowest price and more if you want a larger serving. nearest mrt station is eunos
5
Coming to this place is like a routine affair. There are always so many people here but it's easy to find a table, the queue to order is fast and the food is serve fast too. The prawn noodle soup is consistently tasty. I will usually go for the $8.80 bowl of noodle soup because it comes with bigger size prawns. The freshness of the prawn and the hot tasty soup is what makes me comes back week after week for the last 2 decades
3
Apart from the tasty soup, I think this prawn noodle stall is overated. The soup is both prawn and pork based. For a $5.80 smallest and most basic portion, you get 4 half but fresh prawns, noodles of your choice and bean sprouts. Personally, you can also try the stall at shunfu market (though there are 2). The shunfu market stall has a good soup with more ingredients at a price of $3.
4
We have eaten Beach Road Prawn Mee for close to 20 years already and with two additional members (daughter and son) that came along, everyone in the family only wants to eat their prawn noodles from this stall. The prices have climbed over the years and a meal there today can actually costs as much as a meal in a air-conditioned Chinese restaurant! Nevertheless, the thick and flavorful stock and the juicy prawns are what draws us all the time back to this stall (for those who prefer the dry version, the wonderful chili). At one time, we used to have this on a weekly basis.
5
Every time we head to Singapore we find ourselves at Beach Road Prawn Mee Eating House at least once, if not twice during our short stay. It's always been consistent and has that awesome depth of flavour from the concentrated broth.I'm not usually a big fan of soup or egg noodles in a soup but the broth is incredible and I always end up drinking the broth that others can't finish.Just watch if you sprinkle any extra chilli powder when windy because I ended up with some in my eye whilst sitting in the outdoor eating area. This got everyone laughing but isn't quite as funny being on the hot end. lol!If you're ever in Singapore, this is a must see or taste spot on your adventure the food paradise that is Singapore
3
This eating outlet is well known to many SINGAPOREANS for the prawn mee. The outlet is a typical local eating house setting. The prawn mee comes in three price range: S$5.45, 8.45 and 10.00. The S$8.45 version has two large prawns splitted into four half, few pieces of pork, some mee (choices of different type of mee are available). There is a choice of either DRY or SOUP type. A typical local eating house and not for entertainment. Many other prawn mee eating houses mushroom in Singapore. Some offer better quality and value for money
5
Would go again and again everytime i visit!!!! It's one of my favorite!!! Careful on glittering the chili over your soup, they are quite spicy! Always have 2 bowls of jumbo prawn!!
5
Not the best bust already second best
No AC and prepare to sweat
Ask for more noodle
Go for it at lease one
4
I re-visited this place for lunch yesterday after not having gone there for a long time. The standard remains very high. Has the $8.80 medium sized soup version, with just 2 big prawns sliced into 4 halves. The broth is rich, prawns succulent and cooked just right, and yellow noodles al dente. I rate it the best in the eastern part of Singapore where I live. There's no air conditioning and only one other food stall selling local delicacy ngoh hiang. Place is not near any MRT station so if you are a tourist staying in the city area with only a few days to spare, it's not worth coming all the way here just to try this one dish. You are better off visiting one of the famous hawker centers in the city such as Maxwell Road or Tiong Bahru, where there's a lot more variety of local food to try. If you're a resident here, then this is a must try. Note they close by 4 pm and are closed on Tuesdays.

It's good to see, while we were walking along East Coast Road, that there's a lot of customers inside, it just means that they are providing delicious foods and that's why we've decided to eat here, just don't forget to bring paper napkins for your convenience since they don't normally provide. The place is open-air and has a street food type seating. Lots of mees to choose from. I love their yellow noodle with prawns and pork, it's so tasty and that's the first thing we ate in the morning. Coffee is unique and good too, you'll be surprised by its taste from the regular coffees you drink at your home or in coffee shops
3
They have a couple of locations, here and at Beach Road (hence the name). You have the option of choosing yellow noodles, bee hoon, or even a mix of both, as well as with prawns and/or pork ribs. You should also place your drinks orders at the same time.The soup stock is very rich and tasty and the noodles are cooked just right, every time.Next door, and run by the same team, they sell items such as deep fried prawn fritters, tofu, Chinese sausage (red), and wonton purses etc and these go so well with the sweet and sour sauces.Since you are in the area, head a few doors up and try the char kway teow at the coffeeshop at the junction of East Coast and Telok Kurau Roads - you will not be disappointed
5
A great place to have a noodle!!!! A nice typical singapore atmosphere. The noodle is superb esp the yellow noodle. The soup is a great match. So tasty and very noce aroma. The prawn is also very tasty. Try it with the next stall ngoh hiang and barley drink. You will definitely want for mor
3
I have been eating this restaurant for more than 10 years. This restaurant is a MUST VISIT for me when I travelled to Singapore. The prawn mee is good and the soup is always the best. But it seems like the soup nowadays are not as rich as before. The restaurant environment had improved these recent years as the store is getting bigger and cleaner. And it is more organized. I cant say the Prawn Mee is the best, but This restaurant is absolutely my favorite. Tips for those who are going, PLEASE REMEMBER TO BRING TISSUE WITH YOU. It is easily mess up your shirts of the soup.
4
My bf took me here for the first time last week, he said this restaurant has the best prawn mee and he was right. I've never had prawn mee before and this prawn mee has set the bar high. The prawn was fresh and juicy. The restaurant's building was also food court alike, so prepare your comfy cotton clothes cause it's gonna be messy with the hot weather also
5
Emmm.... first I was curious of why so many people went in and out of this simple looking restaurant. Turned out that it's one of the long established prawn noodles place in Singapore.My husband is a big fan of prawns, so I took him there to try. Without any disappointment, the prawns, noodles/ mee siam (we mixed them) and the soup were truly fantastic! I have the photo to proof. Even by looking at the photo itself was pretty mouth watering.Don't miss it, one of the must try local food in Singapore
5
My first visit in years, I was delighted to find their standards mantained. The broth is still as flavourful as ever, the prawns as succulent. $10.80 is steep for a bowl of prawn noodles, but for the quality of the broth and prawns it's more than worth my money. I don't know if it is the best prawn noodles in Singapore, but it's definitely way up the top.For photos and the full review, head over here: http://www.chocolat-et-basil.com/#!Beach-Road-Prawn-Noodle-House/cmbz/C40033E8-D626-4265-8494-C6D44F1F789

A fren brought us to Beach Road Prawn Mee at East Coast.. We really enjoyed the noodle and the rich and savory soup.
Ordered the Ngoh Hiong too as a side dish to Prawn Noodle.
4
For really authentic prawn noodle soup, this is second to none (or few). A tad pricey at $5.50 a bowl, but most people go for the medium sized $8.80 bowl anyway. Guess Singaporeans are willing to spend good money on good food!
5
Great Prawn Mee and the lime juice is first class. Be prepared however that they are open only for breakfast and lunch and I think closed on Tuesdays and always busy.
5
Prawn noodle is another staple breakfast/lunch food in Singapore. This outlet located along East Coast Road is probably one of the best in Singapore. Besides the obvious ingredient of noodle, what sets this stall apart from the other is the soup/broth. There are 3 serving sizes and the size and number of the prawns differ accordingly. I would recommend the medium size serving where the prawns are large. I would also recommend the prawn and ribs combo too. Alternatively, order the ribs soup as a side to the prawn noodle. The noodles are served either in a soup/broth or dry with sauces. The shop closes on Tuesdays and weekends are crowded so be prepared for long queues. The shop closes late afternoon as prawn noodle is not considered a dinner dish. The shop also serves a good combination of local beverages like coffee and tea that are strong in aroma and taste. This is definitely a key Singapore dish to sample.

I'm reviewing this on tripadvisor because I believe in the old adage: when in Rome, do what the Romans do. That means, when you're visiting Singapore, you'll really need to sink your teeth into some authentic local food to be able to say that you've truly experienced what is uniquely Singapore. And one of the more popular local dishes you ought not to leave without trying is the Prawn Mee (yellow noodles). Without going into too much details (which you can google), the prawn mee is one of many quintessential breakfast or lunch choices for many Singaporeans. And what usually sets apart a distinctive bowl of prawn mee from an average is first the prawn / spare ribs broth, followed by the sambal chilli sauce if you're going for the dry version (think aglio olio and which I personally prefer because you get both the broth in a separate bowl as well as the sambal chilli base sauce). For the latter, a lot depends on how well the cook puts together pieces of pork lard, soya sauce, sambal / chilli paste, and sesame oil to create a unique, well-balanced base for mixing the mee in. In many cases, the cook would also add a dash of vinegar and tomato ketchup, upon request.Having tried quite a few prawn mee stalls, I daresay that Beach Road Prawn Mee Eating house has got both the prawn and spare rib broth and the chilli base done really well. In fact, I'll say it is one notch up from many similar offerings along the Eastern part of Singapore. Likely the result of boiling obscene amounts of prawn heads and pork ribs for hours on end, the flavor of the broth is full, pleasantly sweet as a result of the rock sugar, and nicely accentuated with just a perfect hint of spice. And if you want your soup or noodles more spicy, you can always help yourself to more chilli powder! The dry mee is also springy / al dente and whose flavor is enhanced really well by the sambal chilli base sauce. Portion wise, S$5.50 gets you something decent, but if you want bigger prawns, then I'll recommend that you go for at least the medium-sized portion. That will cost you S$2.50 more, in exchange for two giant prawns, each split down the middle when served. I usually take a combo of prawns and spare ribs. Spare pork ribs, when cooked long enough in soup, falls easily off the bones and melts in your mouth. Yum. And while you're having your prawn mee, do also try the fried fritter stall beside it. You can select your own favourites, have the cook fry them to a nice crisp, and dip into a smattering of chilli and sweet, gelatinous sauce. Finally, before you leave this place, do remember to go for second helpings of the prawn broth. The owners will be more than pleased to know that their prawn and spare rib broth has struck a gastronomic chord with you

The restaurant is nestled in quite heavily residential area. We sae filled tables we saw on the way in. I liked that the restaurant is quite organized, with sufficient staff, and has a system to serve their customers. They are really into serving big orders of their products. We did not wait for our order to be served --Pork ribs Noodle soup-- it has superb big serving of noodles and pork ribs with beans sprouts, and sprinkled with the fried onion and fried pork fat. The soup broth is very flavorful, with a seafood character perhaps due to the prawn mee the place is known for. They also serve variety of fried ngo hiang to accompany their offerings that mostly soups. Each serving can be shared by two persons but can well satisfy an appetite of a hungry traveller
2
Been a big fan of prawn mee for the longest time. Haven't been to Beach road prawn mer for a long time so decided to relive the good times and taste the goodness. Its been about 2 years since i've been back and now the soup taste different - like its full of MSG (i waited for 1/2hr before i said this - i felt super thirsty!) I'm really sad that this place has dipped in standard over the years! :

Hokkien prawn noodle soup is one the popular breakfast or lunch dishes in Singapore. This 'Beach Road' Prawn Mee shop ironically is located in East Coast Road, 20 minutes drive from Beach Road. Occupying the space of two shop houses plus outdoor seatings, it could accommodate about 200 dinners. During weekends, the fast moving queue could be more than 10 deeps. The secret of their delicious noodle is in the thick and robust broth, made from prawn, pork bones, rock sugar, garlic and assortment of spices. Beside the standard noodle, you could indulge in the Jumbo (monster size) Prawn. There's a selection of prawn, pork rib and pork tail noodles, all are garnished with fried shallots, for less than S$10. Cut chili, chili powder and soya sauce are placed on the table to personalized your taste. The 'Ngoh Hiang'(five spice fried spring roll) here is equally popular - with a wide selection of tofu, prawn fritter, liver, pink pork sausage, egg cake and fish ball. Don't forget to try the Kopi-O and lime juicy
5
We are staying with our daughter and son in law and have tried this place twice. We are from uk and if this was there they would need 200 tables as would be packed. Some reviews complained about price ! It is to cheap by half should be double and still good if in the uk. Coming back July and this will be first place to visit!! Outstanding!!

I came here with my sister to try the supposedly famous prawn mee. I am quite hesitant to try this stall due to the high prices of their prawn mee (even though I moved to this area about 2 months ago and "swore" to try all the eateries nearby). S$5.50 will get you a "small" size (which we ordered), $8.80 & $10.80 for Medium & Large/Jumbo prawn mee. Drinks are at about $1.20. The prawn mee in my opinion: - too little kangkong and beansprouts- 2 medium sized prawns cut into halves are fresh- soup broth was "Ok", but honestly, I've tried much better $2.50/$3 prawn mee- the place needs to be cleared faster and more effectively (the birds were coming at the bowls left on the tables and there were litter all over the floor)Sis and I also had the expensive ngoh hiang which was quite disappointing. For the prices we paid, I can't even remember how the Beach Road prawn mee tasted like now and if i would pay for an expensive prawn mee again, all I could think of is the PappaRich prawn mee (with shredded chicken n extra beansprouts) at Parkway Parade
3
Overrated and standard kind of dropped compared to when they were still operating as one unit. Can get better prawn mee elsewhere.
5
Must go early so you will not need to wait too long for the prawn noodle,
4
The prawn noodle soup with pork rib is excellent. It's around s$7 a bowl which is steep for Singapore, but decent value for the quality of food. Parking is difficult in the area so only go if you live near by.
3
Popular.
2
No for me....too much effort for parking woes to be worth it.
4
Great prawn noodle
4
like the prawn mee w soup n "wu hiang"...will go on Sunday morning but difficult to find parking space..
3
Used to taste better in the past when they do not have that many staffs. However, can still go for the Gor Hiang there.
1
its not bad, but way too expensive. overhyped
4
We walk by this restaurant and there was a long line of local Singaporeans waitng to order. So we jump in line and it was well worth the wait. The must have been 30 people ahead of us but the line moved quickly. 3 sizes of Prawn me to order I had the large or Jumbo size and it was very good. If you go here pick a table 1st as they ask this when you order. Eat and you will enjoy! In fact it was so good we went back a few days more for more
