We have been going to Seafood International for many years especially for birthday occasions. The food is great and the service is not bad. Sad to say the restaurant is closing down in mid September.

Medium size family restaurant compare to large scale and unpersonal neighbourhood seafood restos.
Really great. Large choice and any sauce/cooking available.
Recommend.

Good food, great experience.... able to select live seafood and get it cooked the way you like. A good experience for the whole family, young and old.

Service is very slow. Food is served dish by dish despite that we already informed the server to serve all at once.
Pepper crab and salted egg crab are delicious.

Some dishes are nice and they do have nice concoctions of their seafood. However, not everything is good. Prices aren't cheap also.

Amazing food with very attentive staff. The lobster sashimi was so fresh that he was still moving while we ate his tail. Crazy. The chili crab was fantastic, and the clans and shrimp were on point. This was my third time here and I will certainly be back again

The Seafood International Market is located on the east coast and is a bit closer than the more touristy seafood restaurants. You will need a cab to get there. As with most of these type of restaurant, you can select the items you would like to have prepared from the fish tanks so everything is very fresh.For the two of us, we ordered the white pepper crab and a mushroom dish, and it was wonderfully complemented with rice and Tiger beer. The decor is basically a family style restaurant. Make sure you request your hostess to call a cab for you after you are done.

we were invited over and we were 9 persons and it was a great dining experience.upon entry you get the chance to chose your sea food from life stock (if it swims they have it).then we were invited to our special room, and the eating experience starts (nothing among the food I have tasted but GREAT)I loved the place.you are served hot tea before and all through your dining experience.the food was amazing, the service as well and the quality of food is so fresh

Awesome seafood! They are so fresh that it's as if they are straight from the sea! Though it's straight from the tanks. Good and yummy food though it's abit pricey. It's a very good choice to go once a while for the freshness of the seafood.

Love morgan. The fresh fish you can choose from an aquarium are lovely. prepared in a kitchen which is open, where you can see the cooks chop and handle the food with care.

Captain is not friendly and impatient when taking orders. Chicken floss curry powder soft shell crab did not have curry taste. Other dishes are not fantastic too.

Have always enjoyed my meals at this place. Great array of fresh seafood. Fantastic variety of Thai dessert too! All the managers and their service staff are also always so friendly and helpful. Great experience!

Visited for CNY Dinner, food on the good expectation side with very organized kitchen and nice scenery view from table. Shark Fin Soup and Pen Cai was very nice and the portion was great. Will return again!

Everything was fine except we were seated close to few groups of noisy Korean tourists. I would prefer a quieter corner

Nothing compared to the restaurant in Bangkok with the same name.
Food-ok only
Service-ok only
Ambience-so so to ok.
Overall- ok only.

Excellent reasonably priced seafood. Tried crab, tablot fish, prawns. Seafood very fresh. Service very good. Always changing plates

We tried the buffet lunch during weekday and it was indeed a good deal with more than 20 items that we can pick but we felt that the quality is not as good as compare to non buffet style especially the fish.

Went on New Year's Eve. The arrival experience was impressive. It was pouring heavily so my brother let my parents alight at the sheltered drop off area. After he parked the car, the restaurant personnel even when to the parking lot to shelter him from the car to the restaurant. Given it was a PH eve, the level of service was above expectation. The ingredients were definitely fresh and cooking skills good. Satisfied with all the dishes we had.
