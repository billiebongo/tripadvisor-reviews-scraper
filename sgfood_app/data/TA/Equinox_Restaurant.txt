Fine dining at its peak with views that boast the amazing sights of Singapore Bay. Have a glass of champagne to start your meal while admiring the view. And then dip in to your dishes that will make regulars out if you

I received excellent service from the restaurant staffs, the food is an art both pleasing to the eyes and the taste bud. The beautiful and breathtaking cityview is a great place to visit with your love ones.
5
Came here for the view, food turn out to be surprisingly good too, the main course was so delicious, desserts are even better.

We visited this restaurant with friends in Singapore. Overall a disappointing experience:1. The service was extremely slow and poor. There was a wedding taking place in one of the banquet suites which was given as an excuse for the slow service - not good enough for a restaurant of this ‘standard’.2. The ‘view’ was non existent as the windows were full of condensation.3. Overall the food quality was very average and nothing special at all.Whilst the experience was not terrible, for the cost it was really poor. To be fair the restaurant did waive the 20 sgd supplement for the window table (since you could see essentially nothing) but I would not bother returning
5
It was an amazing experience from pre arrival. I would like to particularly highlight Maricor who made me feel at ease whenever I was worried that my surprise would not be smooth. Kudos to her warm smile and the drive to make her clients feel at home. Great employee to have. On a side note, view was amazing and the semi buffet was nothing but fabulous. The oysers, sashimi and desserts were particularly fresh and tasty. Give it a try for hosting a business client or just celebrating a special day. Cheerios to the team, will be back soo

We had dinner at Equinox on Saturday evening. We were not able to book a window table online but arriving at the restaurant a table was free. For a 20 SGD fee we had a great view of the Marina Bay.We started with an excellent White Crab Bisque. The soup was hot and very tasty. Roasted Black Cod and Grilled Main Lobster were our main courses and both were exquisite. We ended with a shared (big enough!) chocolate dessert. We had a half bottle of champagne. All in all paid 500 SGD but well worth the money
4
Lovely view, nice environment and attentive service. The main course was good. We had the barramundi fish.The buffet spread had good choice with clams, mussels, crab, prawns and oysters. We don't usually eat oysters but found ourselves enjoying them here probably as it was cold and fresh. The crab meat didn't taste fresh though. Didn't try the clams and mussels. We love the dessert too; not all the pastries were to our liking. There was fondue and yoghurt. However, we would have liked if there were some station serving hot cooked food.We found the price reasonable as we used the AMEX Platinum card dining experience

Had a severe food poisoning issue on 29th Dec midnight after having lunch on 28th Dec 2017. Non stop an hour of vomiting, bloated stomach, diarrhoea around 2am causing insomnia and uncomfortable entire night. This sickness caused me unable to enjoy my New Year eve and burnt my 2-way bus tickets to KL for my vacation (Attached my medical slip and bus tickets). Should Equinox be compensating my money and long-awaited joyous year end vacation?Suspect root cause is coming from uncooked contaminated oyster, sushi and sashimi. Not to mention there were 14 other persons from my business lunch group were also infected with same illness. We were highly disappointed when the Assistant Manager refused to make any form of serious investigation nor contact us the ill patient to check on details. In short, I will personally never ever visit Equinox unless the high management starts paying attention at this serious issu

We booked in for my wife's birthday and were not disappointed..A window charge of 20 dollars was explained to us before we took our seats.Great ambience...Great food...Great views...We really enjoyed our meals but be warned it's expensive before the 17 % tax is added..Saying that for a special occasion well worth it
2
Have not been here for a while as Amex member , unfortunately the variety and quality had deteriorated . The cold crab is not tasty n meat like not very fresh . The oyster quality is so so ( hardly any flesh ) . Even with the discount , we paid $159 for 3 pax . Think you can get better food elsewhere . Even with only 30-40% patronage , the waiters were no where to be found when we needed them . The main course is also not much to be desired . The waiter was a little pushy when recommending the main course items with additional cost . Will not go again
4
Service was attentive; ambience was great; steak was a little touch; white crab bisque and cod were good.
5
Amazing service, nice views and the food was quickly served and hit all the right palettes. Loved the selection as well
4
Food was good and plated beautifully. Service was impeccable and the ambience in general delights. Definitely worth a return visit.
5
What a place. On 70 floor window table what a view. Watched the light show a must. Saw the change from late afternoon twilight evening.
We choose a la cart the soup fabby followed by outstanding steak. No room for sweet.
2
Went as a group of 10. The people who took the oysters fell sick, one went to the hospital, one had to change his flight....This was the only meal where the pple who fell sick dined together and coincidentally all were ones who took the oysters.

I bought my husband to Equinox restaurant for his birthday celebration. Celebrating birthday in such a luxury restaurant with breathtaking view, you will want to take picture together right? It is normal that the waiter/ waitress will not offer to help to take photo. But even when we requested the waiter to help us, he either forgot to come back after serving the customer or come back after our candle was blowed off. Yes, he took quite sometime to come back. A nice lady sitting in the next table offered to take a picture for us.
1
1st of all we were treated differently as a Chinese Singaporean family as I thought we did be treated equally but no Caucasian were treated more warmly & welcome than us.This time round we had to pay $45 for water from Nordaq and San Pellergrino as Singapore Tap water/Newater isnt available.We couldnt find the previous manager that served us previously as he's superb and this time round we couldnt share our appetizer as we need to order each individually as the previous manager did arrange our orders well mannered and equally to ensure that we did enjoy our meal, will not over ordered and what are our preference (Lucky we were here since decades). As this time round there are zero interaction from the ground staff is ill-mannered serving us couldnt handler our request and came the caucasian manager same result (Almost fainted with sucha high customer service by them).The Grand Platea isnt as fresh as its like being in the refrigerator quite sometime.Everything just seem horrible, horrendous and worst of all many intruders of the toruists coming in to take pictures of the beauitful scenery, we dont mind but not into the dining area!Dont bother paying $20++ for the windows sitting as I wont be and will not be paying it!Food overall were acceptable as we ordered the Foie Gras, Lamb Saddle, Chateaubriand, Strip Loin and etc.I guess nobody really cares in Equinox as I seen so many bad review already lets just add up to the list then
4
We always visit this outstanding restaurant when we are in Singapore. Astonishing views and delicious food calls us back..Food was excellent also this time.Waiter Jaime was willing to talk and we learned much on his native land. Just we noticed that this time restaurant is almost empty! We coiuld not finalize -is it dead season here or prices became frightening for many and they prefer to visit cheaper ones
4
To enjoy this place a reservation in advance is a must: by the window (extra 20$) and with the view of Marina Bay Sands (tables in the middle of the restaurant).We went for the set menu with wine pairing. The food was good. We felt that portions could be a little bit bigger. As for the wine: i thought the servers confused wine paring with wine tasting. They would pour just a little bit, half (!) a glass of champagne, and three sips of wine. Overall experience is a bit overpriced. It would be a good place for special occasion or to impress guests of Singapore
4
So to start off this fine dining restraunt is known for an amazing view which i would agree definitely but the charges for side table is 20$ which i somehow didnt appreciate although i opted for that option myself ( when on date , you say yes , then only she say yes ) i had couple of whiskeys which were standard but the food - chef specialities duck and chicken were damn good .. beware of your budget and watch out for deals if money concerns you as it can do some damage to your wallet . Would i visit again soon ? Yes , if i crack a nice deal . Last but not the least , staff were courteous and decent
5
We were there for our daughter’s birthday lunch on New Year Day. The view is needless to say. The buffet spread was really good with sashimi, oysters and sri lankan crab etc. we ordered the grilled barramundi and the portion is just nice in addition to the buffet.We were really happy with the service provided by the crew especially the one who served our table by the name of Thatxxxxx (apologies did not manage to remember the long name). He was attentive and thanks to his wine recommendation. In fact also heard the next table praising him for his excellent service. Will definitely visit again!!
5
went here last thursday dec 28. i love the ambiance of this place! its so surreal!the service was excellent! (special mention to our host Marites Sabat for her food recommendation and excellent service) the down part was that the view was the glass window has moist( due to the weather that night) but we can still see the view.will definitely visit this restaurant again! i do hope that you will have promotions next time :

I expected flexibility and TOP notched Service but what I received from the service staff when I called them was horrible. The lady can’t help me make any changes to my reservation and asked me to refer to chope but doesn’t she know chope can’t accept reservation for more than 4 diners? Also, all she could say was refer to the reservations team. Disappointing.
1
Our group of 6 all had vomiting and diarrhea after semibuffet lunch on 26th Dec, even needing to visit the doctor. Not to mention the terrible service by the manager on duty that day that refused to fulfil the seating arrangements that we had requested for over the phone when we made the reservation. It was made worse when she pretended to be understanding and helpful, but in actual fact just walk in and out without any intention of resolving the issue. We are unsure if the food poisoning was due to the semibuffet or that our mains could have ‘added ingredients’ due to our seating request. The view was great, but the mood was already ruined with the terrible service. Not the mention the next few days of torture we had to endure
2
Having once written a less than lustre review for the standard of food at Equinox, I did not have the highest hopes about the restaurant when booking a reservation. All I expected was mid-standard food fare, with a bit of flare from the gorgeous view that the restaurant's scenic view provided. It was disappointing then to discover that the palate served at the restaurant has not improved since the last time I had visited, and had even dropped further to the point of being banal. Having visited this restaurant repeatedly over an extensive period, the decline of standards (service mannerisms, food quality) gets extremely apparent with each subsequent visit. While the mains was admittedly of some quality, it was definitely not worth the cost. To make matters worse, the appetisers and desserts fell flat. Equinox possesses one of the best views a fine-dining restaurant can offer in Singapore, but has lost its grit with menu that it serves
5
Visited this restaurant for a good dinner in a good ambience with caring and assertive staffThe staff brought a good bottle of red to complement our beef steak and the staff is patient, articulated and knowledgeable about the food that they are serving. The serving size of the food is appropriate and the design is excellent in tempting your appetite further. The view from the restaurant to the landscape of MBS and MBFC is phenomenal.Highly recommended for dinner of all occasions.
4
It was a great evening celebration with amazing views. Foods was great and service was as expected. We got free complimentary for 2nd champagnes after some mistake made by the staffs. Also got waived $20 for window seats. Overall it was a great place for celebrations
4
Good: Beautiful restaurant on the 70th floor with good view. Quite a variety of food and the service staff were considerably polite. Not so good: Food counters were scattered in diff corners of the restaurant instead of locating at a common place. The main dishes that come with the buffet weren’t very impressive. Speed of clearing the plates from the tables could be improved. Pricing is slightly on the high side
5
Went many times as a couple, first time with my 8 yr old. As usual, views as good ever. Mini buffet is good. A la carte is not bad. Price is acceptable.I think..... if I go to Equinox, it is really for the view, never really for the food. So the mains is the views, the sides would be the food. Haha
4
Celebrated our wedding anniversary with a 3 course dinner here on 12.12.17. Got a window seat at 6:30pm to catch sunset. The view would have been amazing if not for the rain that blurred the windows. Fortunately rain did subside and we got to enjoy some clear view with our creatively prepared dinner. The overall dining experience here was pleasant, service was great. Staff were all well manned and attentive to our need, especially Ms Vernie who served us for most of the evening. She helped us with some fantastic photos and even surprised us with a slice of cake for our anniversary, we appreciate the effort in making this a memorable evening for us.**There are dining promotions with American Express and OCBC credit cards
3
The main course is getting smaller and smaller. Variety of buffet spread is also more limited nowadays. The view is still stunning but it could be improved a bit.
3
went for the buffet lunch for my birthday, the service and the food was good with a nice ambience, will come again.
5
Equinox offers an excellent semi-buffet lunch with a main course. The buffet includes sashimi, cold crab, oyster, and a good spread of dessert. The slow-cooked beef main course was delicious. Tip: get one adult free when you use the Singapore American Express Platinum card.
4
At level 70 even your ears pop. Great lunch buffet. The cold crab with well cracked shell for easy eating. The Salmon main course is great. They have one of the best dessert spread. Even the sashimi is very good. The oyster’s very fresh.
5
Quite expensive, but worth it for a special occasion. Very good service and the quality was first class.
4
a highlight of out visit to Singapore - view was not good because the windows were totally fogged over - overall was a pleasant dinner with very good service
4
Equinox is for sure one of the restaurants with the nicest view, especially in the evening.
And you pay for it. Table at the window costs 20SD extra. Food was delicious, but not extraordinary. Service was in general good.
3
I would like to commend the restaurant for their great service. The view of course is fantastic but you have to pay extra to get a table next to the window. The food however was a big let down, it was the first time I did not finish my steak
4
We enjoyed our main course (Wagyu steak) and buffet seafood appetizers such as Sri Lankan Crab, Mussels, Salmon and Shrimps. Cost us around 190++ for two Saturday lunch. Quite dissapointed they dont allow more than 1 hot drink ended up requested for a soda drink instead. Highly recommended for view & seafood lovers
5
Possibly the best view of all restaurants in Singapore. Paid an extra of SGD20 to have a seat by the window. Food wise it was great. The steak was juicy and not tough at all. It came with truffle MAC and cheese which was simply delicious and worth my money. The service was also good.
5
Great food, great service, great view what more do you need. Cocktail hour then dinner on the 70th floor, very nice.
5
This restaurant is spectacular from the decor to the view! what an amazing experience I had when I went with a friend to dine. You definitely get value for what you pay!
5
Was with family ! Great choice of food and drinks! Not cheap at all but thats the price you need to pay to enjoy it :)))
5
Booked this restaurant for a special birthday. Our booking was quite last minute, was surprised they had availability. They informed us the window tables were all booked but we were pleasantly surprised that they had allocated us a window view table on our arrival. We went for the dinner menu which was fantastic, significantly better value than going a la carte but still maintaining a great selection. The views were incredible and the staff were lovely. Would highly recommend if you are visiting Singapore or have a special occasion
5
Reception service was great, promptly responded to requests and changes. Went for sunday semi buffet brunch and buffet spread was amazing tho the portion for the main is slightly small and on the average side. Overall experience was amazing, pretty much paid for the atmosphere of singapore’s skylin
1
Beautiful views but way over priced and poor service. You have to pay $20 for a window table even if you make reservations. Had to send dish back because it was undercooked. Came back cooked but the rest of my plate didn't have the sauces it had before. Our bottle of wine came when we were pretty much done with our entree.Not worth going
4
Restaurant was located within shopping mall but signage leading to restaurant was not prominent. Lift direct to level 70 was convenient. Restaurant feel was meh (like 80s) but the views are magnificent. Go for window seating if you can afford extra $20. Had lamb and beef steak as main courses with foie gras as appetiser and tasted good. Service crew were mostly helpful except one who turned blind eye even after I asked for assistance.If you haven’t been here, try once to have the aerial view of Singapore. Won’t regret
4
We had the 5 course menu, it was amazing, apart from a piece of hair in one of our first appetizer which was then replaced with a new one, the rest of the food are carefully done and the blend of the ingredients used were very nice and tasty. Manager was very friendly and helpful, waiters were all very polite and respectful, considerate, seems to understand what's on the table, asking if things are ok or anything else needed, constantly seeking feedback as they serve. Some of our extra drinks were even refilled for free, coffee and tea were not charged, plus one final compliment of chocolate and caramel at the end of the experience makes it perfect! Kids were having their own menu, very happy and thrilled with the experience. So if you have kids, don't hesitate to bring and recommended. Atmosphere, lighting, music, all blends very nicely, the 3+ hours lasted seems very quickly..., worth the price we are paying as well as a family dinner....hmmmm...now we are actually thinking, maybe it will soon be our next visit..
4
Thru my friend recommend, I book Equinox restaurant to celebrate my Bf bday n anniversary. Once i make reservation at Chope.co, next few minutes i got reply from equinox cust. service officer to reconfirm my booking and my special request. I love the food and the view there. Nontheless, service is excellent.Ps: window seat need to pay additional 2
3
Was very excited to visit Equinox but soon my disappointments came. Food was honestly just okay and nothing special about it. However the service made up for everything. Not sure if we will come back, but if so, we hope to see a better standard of the cuisines
4
Restaurant is located at Level 70. Both my wife and I were seated near the window where we had a great view of Singapore iconic buildings. We enjoyed the food very much and are glad that we celebrated our wedding celebration there!
5
We came here for dinner and were not disappointed. Enjoying dinner with such a beautiful view and great staff is always a pleasure. Thank you for the sweet surprise in the end!
2
I've been here before when it was Compass Rose and the food was ordinary at best but the view at night is up there with anywhere in the world, however the food is not. Its laughably overpriced - my wife's entree of duck foie gras was ok as was her duck main course. I had blow-tourched scollops which were frozen and tasteless and my pork belly main course came in two pieces, one stringy and the other tough - both tasteless. Dessert was an uninspiring white chocolate brownie and the other a couple of thinly sliced pineapple pieces buried underneath something or other. One glass of red wine and a bottle of water came to $400 with a modest tip. $78 for a pre-dinner cocktail and a tonic water in Ce La Vie but with a window seat! The servings are really small so if you've got a healthy appetite go to a hawker stall after dinner
5
I went here for dinner with a couple of friends. We didn't get a window seat, but would highly recommend that you book early and ask for a window table.The view is fantastic, especially after dark when the light show is on at the Marina Sands.Now for the food - between us we had steak, prawns and fish. All were excellent and enjoyed.Service was good and our meals came out in a reasonable time.After dinner we went to the Ce La Vie Bar at Marina Sands and had a great view back to Equinox.Highly recommended but book early
2
I went to Equinox to catch up with a Friend. While the food was ok and the views were amazing, it’s sad to see such an iconic venue fall into such disrepair. The place is old, falling apart and in desperate need of a full renovation. It’s almost creepy how stale this place has become.
5
Was back to equinox restaurant for the 3rd time. The steak served never fail me or my partner. It come with 2 choice of sides (fries, onion ring, mac and cheese etc.)Before the main dish is ready, the waiter served us bread and butter as appetitiser.A romantic restuarant couple with a beautiful night view of the city. Recommende
5
I celebrated my birthday in this restaurant in the 70th floor and it was the best decision I took. Of course, I booked the table online before, and I also asked for a good place, I really wanted a table directly at the window, to enjoy the nice view over the Bay Sands and it worked properly. The best is you book in advance and you come for dinner e.g. At 6pm. It is before the sun set and before is getting crowded, so you can also take good pictures:-) the food is very good even if a little bit expensive. The atmosphere in the restaurant is nice, the stuff is really very friendly and helpful. We wanted to have a drink in the rouge bar, and the waiter checked during our dinner for a table. Even at the rouge bar the waiter sand the bar men did their job perfectly!
5
Despite dining here for multiple occasions, it still brings me great joy to share a review.The new menu folder illuminates the menu when you open it up. It is the little improvements that makes this place great.Ordered the seafood platter for two and it is delicious. I hope they will consider serving Dungeness crabs instead of Sri Lankan mud crabs in future
5
Arrived early at 6pm and was given the choice to top up SGD 10.00 for a window seat (which the restaurant waived from our total bill in the end). Great views, excellent service (unrivalled anywhere else), most romantic, cosy and relaxing atmosphere perfect for an intimate evening. Food was excellent as well, and since we had a 50% discount it was great value for money. Would recommend/visit agai
5
The restaurant really has fantastic view, but it is rather expensive. Taking into account that there are many rooftop restaurants in Singapore and this one was rather empty except for the tables at the window, the minimum spend and prices in general were not justified. The food was great though, but not unique in upmarket restaurants. We did have a lovely time and the service was very good!
4
Had Sunday buffet brunch with 2 other friends. Had great view of Singapore while sipping free-flow champagne.
Food was normal, nothing much to shout about. However, the free-flow of drinks and the fantastic service is good enough for me to consider a next visit.
3
We were there with the family and were so much in love with the food. However, the service needs some space for improvement, really. I didn't think the staff knew what's really on the menu.
5
The food was awesome but what was most spectacular was the panoramic view! The service was excellent. A special shout out to Selvi, our server. She was attentive , patient n very intuitive to our needs.
4
Been several years since our last visit but we were glad that things didn't change much. Food is good and service is still attentive. However,would suggest that non-local staff's English-language skills could be better.
5
The staff is attentive and very helpful. The food is fresh and the spread good. Lots of lobsters, crabs, beef and salmon!
3
Still an acceptable experience. But they have increased the price by a few dollars. However no increase in the quality of the food. But will still go again.
4
One of the few places that offer freshly shucked oysters as part of lunch buffet. I was pleasantly surprised when they served a slice of yummy chocolate mouse cake replete with candle at end of the meal.
5
Spectacular views and food makes for a great night out. Dining on the 5 course set menu was an absolute joy, whilst not cheap, the food was exquisite and certainly well worth it, an experience not forgotten.
4
Nice view and quiet ambience. Mini live band and magic show for entertainment. Food is good but personally, would love a wider variety.
5
This was well worth the experience. Amazing food, great service, free flowing champagne ( even if I only had water ). How anyone could not enjoy the food would seem amazing. The variety and quality were superb. The views were just stunning. A wonderful panoramic view of the city. I really loved the patisseries, bite size so that you could sample a greater variety. Don't miss this......it really is a treat to enjoy
5
It was so nice.
The outlook was good, the meal was delicious, and the restaurant was perfect.
If you come back here, you will surely find it again.
5
Great food with spectacular view. There is 20SGD surcharge on window side table but it s worth to do that.
1
We ordered the if I remember correctly, most expensive steak in the menu, Japanese wagyu costs 135++ for 225g; turned out to be the worst steak I have ever had. Barely touched it, but it still gave me upset stomach with just two small bites I had. I have had different highest grades wagyu, and it was supposed to be one of the finest food.Besides, we had screaming baby next to our table which we had to pay extra for the view. When we were expecting a sophisticated classy ambience as described? Sorry to be harsh on this comment but it was a very disappointing dinner
3
Ordered 85 dollars of 350 gram of rib eye steak, menu as dry aged , but waitress came back and confirmed only aged for 2 days. When steak is served, its medium cooked but surface felt dry. Other than steak, other are good and delicates made
4
On TOP of 70 floors @ you see this beautiful restaurant. Hosts are forever professional, service staff always wanting to out perform n offer their personal service. Feels good, just been here.It must be more than 18 months since I last visited Equinox.Today, with a group of 5. We decided to go for their ever popular semi buffet/ala carte. Eat as much @ salad, cold dishes, soup n you pick an Asian soup or western for today was cauliflower soup. Pretty good.A good spread of fresh oysters, Sri Lankan crabs & cold large prawns were very good.There's even good salmon roe n caviar to add to your beautiful fresh salmon.Generous spread. One don't go back hungry after visiting Equinox.Three of us had their Angus for main. Was excellent when asked for medium raw.Two others had their fish & they were beautiful too.In summary, Equinox always delight its customers. Been here for years, Guess what they need today is a face lift to make the place better, brighter n ATAS a little more.Keep up the good work
4
I came for early dinner at 5pm. They have a pretty decent set lunch at $58/person. Wines is a little on the expensive side. We were shown to a table with amazing view of the Singapore skyline( staff told us that normally require additional charges) but since the restaurant was empty, the extra charges was negligible. Looking down we saw Merlion, MBS & we were lucky enough to catch some of the spectacular training preview of the airplanes before the National Day. Overall a great experience. Will definitely be back.
5
Went to celebrate family member's birthday. The window seat should be reserved ((at $20) and is available sometimes when u walk in - really worth it as it gives a picturesque view of the city from the 70th floor! Water is charged at $5. The seafood is very fresh - we had their grand plateau (cold dish) for Two, black cod and fries. Total bill was about $319. There is a 10% service charge - which is quite minimum given the attentiveness of the waitresses and waiter who serve you - and GST. The Chef does 'pamper' you with an additional bread (sour dough and warm) and whites chocolate on the house, to start and end tour dinner.
4
Sometimes eating is not totally about the food, and Equinox is an example of this, the setting and view are superb the staff very efficient and friendly, the food only good, one day I will forget what I ate there, but I will never forget eating ther
4
Beautifully decorated restaurant with THE view. I couldn't remember what i ate initially when i wrote this review. So I had the black cod dish. My husband had the lamb. We also ordered a dessert and then the chef delivered us a complimentary dessert for our wedding. Food was alright. I did enjoyed the food. But the thing with this restaurant is the view- breathtaking view. Service were good..
5
The friendly and thoughtful staff go out of their way to delight their customers. Special kudos to Elaine and the lady who served our table (didn't get her name) really made our night with their initiative to make sure we get a good table and gave us a lovely surprise at the end of our meal that ended our night on such a sweet note!Food was good and views were breathtaking as usual but it's the service that was delightful
5
Ambience is very comfortable.
Staff is very friendly and attentive.
Food presentation and taste is appealing.
5
The whole experience was wonderful. I would recommend as a place you would go again and again. It was my third time, but first with family. They all understand the hype now.
4
I have been here with my wife once for dinner. The views are stunning even if you sit on the "balcony". Food is OK (we had 3 courses) but not the best thing of the night. We paid around 300$. I recommend this experience.
1
We tried the dinner before but it was not impressive. Liked their lunch as the buffet session has good spread of variety. This incident happened in CNY. We were here for Semi Lunch buffet on a public holiday. We kicked off our lunch with Oysters. After finished the first 2-3 oysters, my wife found something stretched out its head in the oyster in her plate, it was a light pink color worm around 3-4cm. It was crawling and wiggling actively on one of the oyster. It was really scary. She was TOTALLY gross-out. We complaint to the staff. They immediately took away the worm and got a more "senior" staff to "tell" us the worm was harmless. We did concern their hygiene problem and my wife's health as she already ate a few. It was the first time happened to us. In order to make sure my wife would be ok, so I decided to take the worm and consult doctor. However, the staff in charge refused to give the worm to me. He said staff have already thrown it away. He kept asking us to wait for their manager. After 10-15 mins, we decided not to wait. While we were walking out to elevator, the manager appeared and said he would waive our charge and repeated "it's unusual case and the worm should be harmless". (well, we only ate a couple of oysters and even didn't start eat something else or drink anything...harmless or not, it was disgusting, we have completely lost our appetite). It was a public holiday, our doctor was off and most of the clinics were closed. The manager said they would only bear the medical cost if my wife later felt sick and doctor proved that it related to the worm. However they were not able to return the worm for doctor..
4
 Great views as usual. Food was generally OK. Service was better this time. I wish they had real ice cream and not the soft serve concoction that they provide. The machine does not allow anything but a full serving! And it sort of gets dirty looking after a while.
5
Really good and excellent service. The Magician was a nice addition. Food was really good and the drinks just keep coming. The oysters were continually topped up, but the lobster did eventually all go. The deserts have improved, I am guessing due to the new Jaan Chef
4
Visited Equinox/City Space with a friend for a night of drinks as the bar up top was still under renovations.We had a fantastic view of the Singapore skyline from up top. The staff were friendly and the drinks were flowing freely.There was also live music by a pianist and that was lovely. A little bit of a chore to go to the toilet and the smoking room as you have to go down two levels to get there via a side stairway but other than that overall was an amazing experience. P.S , get ready to pop your ears as the elevator going up is super fast
3
Honestly, we’re not big brunch people. We do like to go out on occasion and enjoy an afternoon with friends, but it is usually a couple of times a year. As a family with younger children, the quality and range of food is important to us. Friends invited us to join them at Equinox, for the “pink” Sunday brunch.Before I weigh in, I have to say the service overall was good, and the quality of food was as well. However, the range was very, very limited and it seems that this restaurant has a champagne brunch on the premise that “everyone else has one.”Brunch is defined a combination between breakfast and lunch whereas this could only be called Lunch With Booze That Finishes at 3pm Even Though the Website Says 330pm. Not a single breakfast item adorned the buffet, unless one is in the habit of snaffling a few oysters with one’s coffee. No eggs, no cereals, no waffles, nothing. So technically, this isn’t “brunch” it’s just an upgraded lunch buffet and one that wasn’t replenished when items ran out.The pink theme was a gimmick clearly not thought through. While there was rose champagne (hence the motivation for a pink theme, I suppose), and the senior staff wore pink ties, there was bizarrely someone dressed in a pink panther suit roaming the restaurant. The suit was clearly not easy to use, as the wearer kept having to stop and lift the mouth – which I assume was helping him or her see where they were going. In the end, they gave up, and were escorted around by a member of staff, with the panther firmly gripping the thumb of their guide, leaving one with an impression that the panther had rather overdone it on the Moet before depositing their dignity at the door and entering the restaurant in costume. My children were not impressed and the spectacle added nothing to the experience. The roaming magician, however, was excellent.All in all, it seems Equinox relies on the fact that it is on the 70th floor to sell its brunches. That’s fine, but you can’t eat the view

We took the early evening deal which was very good value. The food was interesting and really well presented. The service was good and the view was superb. If you want a restaurant with a good view this is the place to go. This was a fathers day meal and proved a very good experience
3
The views are really great - and if that's what you are after great. The food was very average and inconsistent - this is not fine dining - its an attempt to make interesting dishes at heavy prices - but not a good one. The service is also really poor. You have to flag a waiter down to get a drink - and it wasn't full. go for a drink rather and eat else wher
3
Dessert selection drastically reduced. A pity really. Good thing is that they still serve oysters as part of the appetiser spread.
5
What a beautiful place with a great vibe and all happy hour cocktails till 10 pm and we'll made as well, amazing views of the city, will definitely go again
4
Excellent view of Marina Bay, excellent personalized service, superb ambiance, good food, amazing lighted menu
4
Had weekday set lunch with 5 friends. The restaurant serves semi-buffet lunch and provides a good spread of appetizers and desserts.The appetizers and desserts is a wow but little can be said about the main course. I did not manage to try most of the cakes as they are not refilled after 1.45pm (this is the first time I see so many empty plates displayed in hotel buffets). Service is a little slow as well.Scenic view in the 70th storey restaurant, it overlooks the beautiful city area. I am looking forward to trying out their weekend brunch buffet soon
3
We choose this restaurant because of the view. The evening view on the Marina bay was faboulous. We paid 20SGD extra for a window seat and it was definitely worth it! We took the 5 course menu with the wine pairing and our final bill was 650SGD for 2 people. The food was ok, however the taste and the presentation came nowhere near to that of a "haute cuisine restaurant" (as the very high prices could suggest). You can go there for dinner for the "breathtaking view" with the window seats...however better order less sophisticated dishes like dry aged beef or chicken

Let's share the unacceptable facts about our worst experience in Singapore after living here for 9 years as expats:- wanted to book today a table for 6 pax at 7:30pm in order to enjoy a nice Saturday night fine dinning and wine. 7:30pm being the standard time for starting a weekend dinner- the hotel management told us that we will be kick out of the restaurant at 8:15pm when the second service starts. Giving you around 20mn for eating your food once delivered! You would have more time at a good court or McDonald's obviously!Conclusion. Let's cancel the booking for 6 pax and inform our friends, colleagues and family to avoid this arrogant place at all cost. Poorly managed, doesn't deserve our visit

We were there for dinner having made a reservation. We had asked for a windowside table and got one. The views were incredible and it clearly is a special occasion place. I started off with pan seared foie gras which was good and a generous portion. My main of duck breast was disappointing. Had ordered it medium, but one of the pieces was well done and chewy. A restaurant of this caliber should not serve it like so. For dessert we ordered the tasting platter that was very good. Had a pre-dinner cocktail at the adjoing bar that was a cardamon infused gin based cocktail and was pretty good. At dinner, I had a Singapore Sling that was decent. Now for my main bugbear- the dining chairs were incredibly uncomfortable and so very dated. Uncomfortable, because they had no proper back rest. In terms of looks, they looked like they had been purchased 30 years back at a closing down sale. Seriously, lose the chairs. So who should go here ? If you want to impress a date, perhaps. If you like outstanding food, no. Great views, shame about the food.

This is a beautiful high end restaurant with great views and excellent food.I was perfectly prepared to pay top dollar and wouldn't have objected if I hadn't felt like they were trying to squeeze every penny out of my wallet that they could.Insisting they had no tap water and charging for what I am sure was tap water poured from a carafe was one example.Amother was warning us that entrees took 35 minutes so we should order appetizers when we had our food in a very reasonable time.It just all felt pushy and cheap and odd and did a great dis service to a delicious meal with a beautiful view

First night on our recent trip we decided to revisit Eqinox, 10 years after our first time there. Magnificent food and attentive service; staff kept a vigilant eye on how fast courses were being presented during the degustation and managed them accordingly.We requested a window table which attracted a $20 charge which was removed when we chose the degustation menu (just as well as the combination of indoor ac and outside humidity meant the windows were misted and nothing could be seen).One other thing; unless you're happy to pay for bottled still water ($15 per bottle) ask for iced water. When we mentioned that we didn't want bottled water we were offered no option but noticed how to get what we originally wanted by observing the locals!Water and window issues aside this was an excellent dining experience
4
Located in the 70th floor (the bar is actually in the 71st floor) of the Swissotel/Fairmont, Equinox offers amazing views over the city. Drinks are very expensive (as everything in Singapore) but good quality. The food in the restaurant has star-quality (a la carte). I only was there for a reception with buffet food and wasnt too impressed, but overall its a great place to go with a view
5
It was awesome dining at Equinox , with attentive waiters to splendid personalised touches on the cuisine . Appreciate the extra effort by the waiters to make my birthday celebration as perfect as it can be .
4
Dinner was good and no complaints on the service. The only glitch was that they were not able to find my reservation and i had to wait for 5 mins or so for them to look for my reservation.
3
the food took quite awhile to be served. the ambience was good but only if you pay the surcharge to be seated by the window.
5
It's semi buffet lunch. However the buffet spread does not have much variety. The Tom Yam soup was too blend.
5
This was definitely one of the best meals we had during our time in Singapore and the view was simply stunning. The best time to get there is as it's getting dark so you get to experience the view in the light and the dark. We both had steak and it was absolutely delicious. No complaints at all from me and whilst it may be obvious, worth noting that smart attire is expected and men wearing shorts will not be let in
4
I was invited to dinner at Equinox on a Sunday evening recently -- the setting really is beautiful in daylight and even better when its dark -- we had a table at a window looking out over Clarke Quay the view is spectacular, however it is the food I wish to write about.I ordered Angus Beef and to say I was disappointed is an understatement, when I go out for dinner I want a meal not what some executive chef thinks I should be eating. The meal itself was not good the beef had been cooked until it was falling apart but it had NO TASTE the sprinkling of vegetables to make the plate look good does NOT impress me but my biggest complaint was about the potatoes -- the Chef seemed to have used a tea spoon to spread an amount of creamed potatoes (yes they were almost fluid) on my plate and when I requested more potatoes my host was charged Sing $ 20 for them. I am fed up with what's called fine dining places ripping off customers under the pretence that they can charge amazing amounts of money for almost nothing --- would I ever go back there again ? YES to look out the windows but NEVER again to eat ther
4
Had the degustation menu and at over $200 Australian dollars per person I would have expected tap water would be available but the French manager in charge only offered us still or sparkling-at a further cost of $15 per bottle so beware-make sure you order iced water in the futur
4
great view, great atmospherehad some issues initially when it came to getting a slice of cake prepared to celebrate my friend's belated birthdayit was a hassle to go through everything and explain the situation, and staff seemed unhelpful at firstim just glad everything got sorted out nicel
4
Amazing view of Singapore skyline from the restaurant (however there's a S$20 surcharge for window seating). Food was pretty good (however bit over-priced I think). Service was good too, quite attentive. One strange practice though - warm water (so called "free flow") is charged at S$5 per head - strange enough that I've never heard such things anywhere else, lol.
5
We were taken here at the end of a 5 week trip....what a finale! Had a table by the window and the view was spectacular as the lights went on all over the city. As for the food it was delicious and the service delightful. We shared a selection of appetisers and they were all wonderful. Some of us had steaks, which were melt in the mouth, while four of us shared seafood platters.....the lobsters were some of the meatiest we have ever eaten. It is perfect for a special occasion. We did not pay the bill so cannot comment on the value
4
Like the service & food. Ordered steak with bone marrow. very nicely done. Choose the window seat... for a romantic dinner
5
The steak was very good. Had it in medium rare. Just the right amount of juice. Would definitely come here for steak again.
Hope someone can make the tables a bit more steady though. The table kept shaking as we tried to cut the steak!
3
New desserts. Not bad. Nice chocolate cake. And an interesting apple mousse cake. Unfortunately, the grass fed dry aged angus beef was not tasty. No table cloth. Big windows. So can be too bright and glaring on a Sunny day. Better at night.
5
It was a pleasant experience. The food and the view is excellent. Will definitely visit the restaurant again.
5
Wow!!!!! What a view and what a lunch!! We chose this restaurant mainly because of the view and we were so glad we did because the view is SOMETHING ELSE! Food and champagne were similarly impressive......unlimited supplies of both. Couldn't recommend highly enough
3
We made an impromptu decision to dine at Equinox. The window seats were fully booked for the night but our wait staff was very helpful in arranging a table with a good view. Throughout our meal, service was generally prompt & courteous. The menus are illuminated which is a plus.We ordered red wine, seared Foie Gras, 500g Chateaubriand with sides of mashed potato & macaroni cheese. The warm crusty bread basket was very delicious so we had seconds. The foie gras was just basic & bland as we could only taste the sweet sauce. The best foie gras I had was cooked by Chef Shahnaaz Russell Wong which I have reviewed separately under D2TLLRY. It has that perfect bit of crispy fat like on the edge of a grilled steak, the soft crumbly fat, not burnt, just browned & crispy, served with perfectly caramelised apples. The complexity of salty sweet flavours were just amazing!The chateaubriand was alittle veiny, turned cold & bloody very quickly so we had to request for it to be warmed up again. The landing area at the restaurant entrance overlooks the padang/clarke quay & offers the best spot for a cityscape picture. However, this is not the case after dark as the blinding bright lights illuminating the elevators cast their reflections on these glass panels, causing distortion.Overall, an Ok place to dine with a good view but moderate your expectations on the food
5
Went to this restaurant for my birthday celebration, services & food is excellent. View wise is normal due to charges of $20 if you want to sit near window for view. I feel that sit near window shouldn't be charge & its not worth $20 to pay for sitting near window
4
If you go, it must be for the window tables. The view of Singapore from there is spectacular, especially at dusk. The food is modern European with no Asian twist. Found a very good 2008 Bordeaux at an approachable price for a restaurant such as this. When paying a bill as large as at the best restaurants in London, the lady offered a 50 discount if paid by platinum Amex. But mine did not work as it must be issued in Singapore. Anyway I would go to the bar upstairs next time instead of the restaurant.

My wife and my 2 year old son went together to celebrate my birthday for a dinner here at Equinox rest. The food, the drinks, the ambience, the staff and everything was perfect until something unexpected happened which caused our mood to a down spiral. Here is the prelude to the incident, well as everyone knows a 2 year boy can be active and helpful most of the time, same goes to my 2 yr old toddler boy who merrt go round the table we are seated but he did not disturbed other diners. So our friendly and helpful female filipina wait staff provided our son a picture card and a non-permanent ink pen for him to be entertained. Somehow my young son had scribbled it onto our table and that's when the incident started. A tall stature male cascausian wait staff approached our table to clear some empty tables on our table but he never greeted us, my wife or me. Not even a 'good evening sir or mdm or how' the food or did u guys enjoyed your dinner? Instead he saw the oen scribbles which not a lot at all, he blantly said, " just becareful with the table that your kid has done" And it iis then i had realised my boy had scribbled it on the table, my wife and i paused for a while because we did not expect words like that will proceed out from the mouth of such a well-dressed waiter or manager, i am not sure. Well, my wife n i did not show our displeasure because indeed our son had scribbled it on the table, but what kind of damage can a 2 yr old toddler do to a table? Nevertheless i apologized and said sorry to him and he said "no worriea" and just like that he left our table without even say, hope u guys enjoy the evening or something nice. I regretted for apologising to him later. After he left my wife uses her bare index finger to try erase the pen scribbles and that's when we realised it is a non-permannt ink pen the Equinox Restaurant had provided for our son. To end this story, i would say a fine private dining resraurant like Equinox should trained staff not to be over emphasized on small issues esp when our boy is just a toddler, the cascasian waiter or manager indeed spoiled my birthday mood but everything was perfect except this male cascausain staff

If Money is not an issues and you enjoy Great Quality food like Seared Foie Gras, Yellowtail Sashimi, Jamon Iberico, Slow-cooked Kurobuta Pork Belly, Miso-roasted Black Cod, then this is the place to be. Top up with some PInk Champagne would be the icing on the cake.It does has some credit card promotion discount 50% for 2 person but need to find out the details before your book the place. its highly popular due to its Scenic view and can comes with a relatively high price tag.Can take the evening Drink with cover charge if you just want to admire the Vie
4
We went there after dinner for a cocktail.
View is fantastic, just this is a value for the appointment up there.
Great music relaxing you after one busy day.
Service also more than what expected.
5
Had a fabulous lunch over at Equinox. Staffs is friendly and the ambience is peaceful and quiet. Most importantly the view at the top is remarkable!
5
this was our second visit and, although not cheap, is well worth a visit. Food, service and views are outstanding.
4
Been here for lunch.
They made a buffet with a lot of choice, Asian cuisine, Europe cuisine, overall the service, the taste, is good.
The best part of this restaurant is the view, we saw Merlion Bay from level 70, looks great.
4
The panoramic view is what this place is all about Stunning views across Singapore Food also good although needs booking for the right table Drinks before in the next door lounge good Not cheap but View is worth the extra Service good and helpful Would recommend
5
Went there last April 7 with 2 of my girlfriends. Was very amazed with the view of the city. It's just fantastic. Coupled a sunset view. The meal was very much enjoyed by me and my friends. I even had a lovely chocolate cake for my birthday
5
Visited the restaurant for my wife's birthday along with my 10 year old Son. They took great care to make the visit enjoyable, particularly for my son who was feeling a little out of place in this fine dining setup. We ordered the cod and the tuna,both of which were cooked perfectly. The views in the evening were very pretty as well with whole city lighted up below you. You have to pay extra for a seat near the window but was worth it for a special occasio
2
The food is fabulous, the view is breathtaking but the atmosphere is more cafeteria than restaurant. Our window seat was the best with a view of all there is to see in Singapore spread out in front of us. The menu was comprehensive and all the dishes were prepared to perfection.HOWEVER the front of house management needs vast improvement. There aren't any tablecloths and the table tops are old giving the appearance of being dirty. Also the clink of cutlery and glassware is not a good sound. We might be old fashioned but a nice white tablecloth makes a meal.The tables were not cleared after diners left.A table for eight just behind us was left uncleared for over an hour.There are very simple solutions for bringing this place up to the standard that we can find anywhere in Sydney at more reasonable prices
3
As always, the ambience is always excellent, dining at the top of Singapore.Food, especially the Tenderloin steak was good for the semi-buffet, though need to top up $10.They have many choices of cheese, and sashimi, for the buffet.However, the non-extra-payment choices are limited if you are meat eater and do not want to top up. The Halibut fish is very very small portion.I am pretty disappointed with the dessert, as I expect Equinox to be tip top in their pastry. The cakes were so-so and lack variety.Also the whole restaurant seems to have only 2 mail servers! They are so busy running that I have to wait and wave to get their attention. They are nice, but can see they are too busy and forget things until we have to gently remind them again. I hope the restaurant can increase some servers!I told them I am celebrating my anniversary but no mentioned during the visit at all, so a bit disappointed.Overall still great experience
5
Celebrated our Wedding Anniversary here recently and had a fantastic night.Prior to dining had cocktails on the 70th Floor and the views were amazing. Dined, but regrettably could not get a window seat. Having finished the first course, the waitress managed to move us to a table by the window. The food and the service were excellent and the staff even made us an anniversary cake, which made the evening.Everything about the evening was special and thanks to all of the staff.Not the cheapest evening out, but worth every penny
3
The Panorama is so Wonderful.... the harbor view create a fantastic atmosphere for a great dinner ... unfortunately the quality of the food is normal ... good but not at the level of view . Such a grate atmosphere need more high quality Meal..
4
Nice meal. Average cocktail. Good ambience & service. Amazing panorama. 20 dollars extra just for a window table, I feel, is a bit tacky. Haven't come across it before at any of the other classy restaurants around the bay.
4
Semi Buffet lunch spread was good. Like the buffet spread and that main course is off the menu. Of course the city view from Equinox was fantastic
5
An endless flow of vintage Champagne, some of the best Sashimi I have ever had, and a high quality buffet of amazing delights.
The dessert area was stunning. Service great. Noting to fault and will go back next weeken!!
5
My first time visit to Equinox restaurant. The service was really good, service crew were all very polite. The food was yummy, and I really enjoy the overall restaurant ambience. Thank you for the complimentary cake for birthday celebration 😊
2
Been to EQuinox..many times over the last decade...what a shame.Food was average at very best.. awful for some courses...of course expensive but thats expected, but then the staff showed no real warmth or engagement ... felt like they knew it was now a tired and somewhat lost restaurant.Only saving grace was the view which always impresses !Such a shame....lets hope someone with passion and ideas can re-energise and re- birth it soon

This restaurant has one of the best views in Singapore. On the 70th floor of the Swissotel at City Hall, it's a 200 degree view of the south side of the island and on a clear day you'll see for miles!The food is very good and the service is also good but a little too staid for a an island that is famous for friendly, professional attention, rather than formal stiffness. The ambience is very dim lighting and a space that looks a little unused. The wine list is extensive but quickly gets very expensive....for British guests a comparison is a Louis Latour Bourgogne that you'd pay Â£13 pounds for in Waitrose will cost you upwards of $130 in Equinox...the unfortunate reality of drinking in Singapore. Reading this it sounds like I'm marking this place down, but I'd recommend it for visitors to the island or those looking for a great view and very nice food.
3
Book early and get a window seat, the view is amazing. The rest of the experience is ok What does get to me is when the request for tap water is denied and one is forced to order bottled water after spending well over $150 per person on foo
2
My family and I had dinner on March 11th and spent almost $1,400 at the restaurant, dinner through the entrees was very good. Once the entree dishes were cleared the service staff disappeared. After an extended period we flagged down a staff member to order dessert and coffee. When the Choco Ganache dessert arrived, we tasted the ice cream and it was disgusting and uneatable. Everyone in our party tasted the dessert and uniformly hated it. We tried to get the attention of the wait staff to return it but to no avail. When I was able to mention it to the staff, they talked to the chef and I was informed that he said the taste was strong and many people don't like it. They did nothing to make ANY effort to be considerate of our comments. Hard to believe that after having a very nice meal it would be ruined by an indifferent chef and staff over a $22 dessert!! I would not recommend this restaurant
3
Pleasant food. Nothing particularly memorable, but nothing bad either. Very good external views, but the internal furnishings are worn. Surprisingly, my chair was damp and had to be changed. Took several minutes, as another chair had to be brought from elsewhere in the restaurant. I had to stand while this was done. I have been to Equinox many times, and service is usually OK, as long as you don't expect too much. It's a good place to wow guests with the view. There are better tables and squeezy tables. Restaurant also has temperature issues. Usually tends towards being too warm, but sometimes, some parts are drafty. So, do bring a wrap or a jacket, that you can take off or put on, as needed
4
had a business group event at the restaurant and the staff service quality was great. The set menu was pleasant and all the guests have great review of the 3 course meal as well. Most importantly, excellent sunset and night view of Singapore.
5
if you like to get a recommendation for good view ( no outside area) and great quality of food and service then you have the best combination at Equinox
5
The ambience is nice. Great view outside. Nice service and good food. Having food, wine and nice music with my friend was an enjoyable night.
5
Wait staff is excellent - very attentive. Menu is somewhat limited but what we had (tenderloin and duck) was very well prepared and quite tasty. Extensive wine selections. Very nice music in background.
5
It is an awesome experience to dine @ 70th Floor, the evening view was incredible. Being vegetarians the food choice was very limited for us. Neverthless the view made us feel we werent missing food.
5
Went there for an early birthday celebration lunch with my daughter. The quality of the food at the semi buffet lunch was very good and compliments the service assistant Angela rendered an exceptional service, very polite, & attentive.
5
We met my brother in law here for an evening meal. Having lived in Singapore for 26 years we reckoned that his choice of Restaurant would be good and how right we were.
5
Very nice n polite waitress n waiter......excellent service n great view. I will come back for more soon.
4
Go if You want good atmosphere, food is soso. Great view all around, good range of food, but taste wise average
2
Food is ok and desserts are good because not so sweet but the mood spoiler is coffee tea only one serving ! Unbelievable! It's semi buffet and without second cup serving of coffee or tea. So stingy for such a classy environment. not recommended to go again when now we have many such views around marina bay.
5
Excellent food, outstanding service and unbeatable views. We arrived at 6pm and had the benefit of the views in daylight and then through dusk to darkness - incredible. Highly recommended.
5
Amazing views of the Marina Bay area. I have been to Equinox for both their lunch and dinner services. Despite dining there for more than 5 occasions, I still find the view breath-taking and the food gastronomically satisfying.
5
Since it's at a high floor, you might as well pay extra $20 for a window seat, worth the view. Service was excellent, from the bread selection to starters and beef ribs was the highlight. Its so tender, melt in your mouth tender!
3
We got a table in a corner so we couldn't enjoy the atmosphere. With that money we could have a perfect dinner somewhere else, which we will do next time.
5
Great service, fantastic view of the city. My friends and I had remarkable night particularly it was a surprise engagement proposal dinner for my friend. Thank you to the team of Aravin- Assistant Manager, Maritess and Nino of New Asia. You really made the dinner arrangement smoothly and exceptional for my dear friend. . You make every details possible that night. Absolutely no doubt of the servic
4
Probably over of the best Views in Singapore fromo level 70. Nice decor and good service. Had tasting degustation menu where every dish was very good. No extraordinary ingredients or fancy creations but standard dishes very well executed (beef that is literally melting on your mouth). Accompanying wine selection with the red a bit on the cheap, not in line with food quality. I ordered a cabernet as replacement which was fantastic but as with everything there priced very high. In line the extra charge for window tables
4
We stayed at its neighbour hotel, Fairmont so we decided to check it out at late hour. The band was about to wrap up for the night so I just had time for one drink and enjoy the view from 70th floor. Lovely service with a nice drink and beautiful night view.
4
The seafood buffet was nice!Will not say "more than nice" However what makes the money was the view of SG per se.Worth giving a visit if you have good budget, and are looking for a place for good dining (dinner) with good friends or families to chit chat while eatingThis restaurant Will give u a great experience
5
On 17 January 2017, visited Equinox Restaurant for dinner. Restaurant located on level 69 of Swissotel The Stamford. Direct access from City Hall MRT station.Witnessed the sunset, twilight and night city view and marina bay view. Enjoyed the fantastic views from all angles.Had 3-course dinner chosen from mix and match from ala carte menu. Lobster ($95) and Atlantic fish ($75) basing on market price. Onion soup was little but appetising. Grilled Maine Lobster was well cooked and tasted great, after deshell it weigh about 100 grams. Specially made fruit platter with sorbet was refreshing. Nice dinner with great view.Enjoyed the meal at $173 per person. Additional $20 surcharge for window seating. Reservation recommended to avoid disappointment. Washrooms located on level 69 with the smoking room. The walkway stained by the unpleasant cigarettes smell
5
We only had two days in Singapore so wanted to go somewhere memorable to make our honeymoon special. I don't usually have the budget for a restaurant like Equinox so visiting here was very much a 'one off'. We had pre booked a window seat and the views are simply stunning. The 5 course taster menu was really impressive and made so much better being able to look out across the city and bay. Our server, Kingston was exceptionally nice and explained each dish when it arrived and was really friendly. Would recommend Equinox to anybody who wants a special dinner.
5
Great views over marina Bay while enjoying the Champagne and wonderful selection of food on offer.
The staff were attentive and the glasses alway kept full.
5
Samual made the meal and the whole experience a notch higher. can't recommend the restaurant more just based on his great service! Thanks Samual!
5
Would love to have chicken and beef for the buffet spread but only seafood. Variations are not so tempting for return trip.
4
The restaurant served western food, I have the steak which is quite good, juicy and tender. The views at night was amazing, good for special occasion and the place was quite big suitable for meeting/ gatherings.
5
Went there for dinner with family and friends for a Birthday recently. The view is incredible at night and well worth paying extra for the window seats! $20SGD from memory. Especially loved the dim lighting and back lit menus. the service was first class and was the complimentary round of drinks from the house. would definitely go back and highly recommend for a special occasion
1
It was a weekday evening, we paid the additional SGD20 for a table of 2 close to window. At first, our order of one main course and appetizers was rejected by one of the staff as she said the minimum order was at least 2 main courses. But we couldn't find this term from their menu or online. Then we double check with another staff, he then clarified that it was the minimum requirement of using AMEX card for the 50% off promotion. As soon as we told him we didn't know that promotion and we were not using AMEX, he took our order. We didn't understand why the staff just assumed every guest using AMEX or it was because the prices of their food were unreasonably high that no one would pay full price in this restaurant like us? The food was ok. Service was bad. The view made a little compensation for the overall experience. Now that we know why the staff assumed everyone using AMEX 50%, it's not worth to pay the full price here.
3
go there for the view but I would say only for the view... I went there for a business dinner. I would say that the food were decent but it's way too expensive for the quality of the food. the service is a bit slow if you are a group
5
it is always the better quality of buffett lunch compared to most hotel nowadays. Oysters are replenished without having to wait. The salad bar has extensive selection. The seafood is extremely fresh. Very pleasant and prompt wait staff and best ambience overlooking Singapore exceptionally beautiful landscape from the 70th level
5
A group of extended family members came for dinner as a relative from overseas was in town. The pull of this outlet is the great views it offers especially of the Marina area. As we were there early, we also managed to be submerged in the wonderful colours of the sunset. The food is equally good. Actually all of us enjoyed the bread that was offered whilst waiting for the main course which did not disappoint as well. Definitely will come back.
5
Shared a birthday brunch (buffet) with friends. The food selection was extensive and beautifully presented. The free flow champagne left us all very mellow and the staff were extremely courteous and attentive. It was a lovely unhurried dining experience with views of Singapore that were stunning
5
Food is damn awesome. Worth every penny. Steak is insane. Will come back for more. Not forgetting that the view is terrific. Very good service as well.
4
I celebrated my wife's birthday at Equinox. We enjoyed the fine dinning & breath-taking night view of the Singapore skyline and Marina Bay. It's an upmarket restaurant for special occasion.
4
The service is good and everything's very professionally set. The view is amazing. The only grouchy is that desserts are not delicious as I tend to like desserts. Food is ok but I'm sad they have stopped serving foie gras on the buffet station. That was incredible.

Equinox serves great food accompanied with a spectacular view from the 70th floor. Was totally blown away by the lit menu! Chef was also very accommodating by sharing with us behind the reason for every ingredients used and the rationale behind each dishes. Definitely a great dining experience.

I booked a table for 2 at lunch time about two days in advance. However, I think can book later since the lunch buffet was not crowded at that time. I was told the price is increased a bit due to festive menu, which is ok for me. But we can't choose the table at booking time and it is not guaranteed for a window table. It was fine for me since most of tables for couples they put near the window anyway. I hardly found any tables that not near the window, I guess this is their selling point.I will not touch on the service since it is already upscale standard, nothing to complain. The variety of food is not large enough, I think much lesser that Kushinbo or Sakura for example. You don't have pizza and those pasta. They have sushi, sashimi, and seafood. However, we enjoyed their appetiser counter with high quality cheese and toppings food. One a-la-cart main course add on is another unique, which is why they called "semi buffet lunch". The main course menu changed a bit with the festive season, but look decent and good taste.The view is totally great. It covers the whole city center and one of the highest place. You can see my photos later. A note is if it is heavy rain, you can see anything at all :) which we encountered in the middle of the lunch but lucky it ended very fast

We booked for Christmas Dinner at 7pm. The meal was perfect ...just as the view was over Singapore. Thanks to the chef for the little treats they sent us, and for the beautiful ginger bread house.We had a perfect evening, with beautifully presented food and staff were lovely and very helpful. We would recommend this for fine dining...just perfect, thanks guys

They changed the buffet lunch-apparently Prive is cheaper too than before. No more hot sides. Just your usual seafood and bread and desserts. Now includes a main course. And no more free flow of foie gras. ):Food wasn't as good as before. Quite a disappointment. Only good thing remains is the view of the scenery.
3
If you are looking to have a good Singapore view, this is not bad. If you need to sit near the window then you need to pay SDG20. Not free drinks of water, they need to charge you for SDG 5 per person. Food is okay, reasonably priced
5
We booked this Restaurant on the 70th Floor of the Swissotel because of the reviews and the location overlooking Singapore and we weren't disappointed, the dining experience started as we zoomed up in the lift (very fast) and the doors opened up and we walked out to be greeted by one of the most amazing views over Singapore at night time that you could wish to see.We had asked for a window table and were graciously provided with one. (Tip you can pay a little bit extra to guarantee table). We were a party of 4 and were looked after so well we keep on talking about this dining experience all the time. The menus are really innovative as they are backlit so that you are looking at an illuminated menu, so easy to read. Great choice of food and the wine list is great as well.Food was amazing and the service was continually outstanding throughout the evening. The wait staff are so professional and attentive it just added to the experience.We even managed to enjoy a Cape Mentelle Shiraz from Margaret River which was superb. This is an experience you dont want to miss out on when in Singapore, the food, views and ambience all add to the experience
5
As always, at one of the highest building, you get to see the world and have the finest meal..quiet and peace for me. This has always been a place where i love to come for lunch to get my sanity..food is great except for their main course which is the pork belly that is filled with old and they should consider removing it from the menu (filled with fats that is definitely not edible). Service is great as always
4
Good place for lunch. superb view, food is good and the spread of semi buffet is decent.
only problem is the long walk to the restroom =X.
Use OCBC cards for discount!
5
We went over to equinox restaurant to celebrate our 2nd year wedding anniversary. The service and the food is excellent. They gave us a window seat and also a free desert after our meal.
Definitelya place to go again.
5
Love the ambience, love the quality of food, love the service. Highly recommended for couples to visit the restaurant.
4
The ambience is great! Service is good and the food (not to mentioned quite a call of varieties) and? is tasty. Relaxing meal experience and will definitely re-visit.
1
I had the semi-buffet lunch and suffered a terrible food poisoning, with cold sweat, committing, diarrhea, fever and fatigue. It lasted several days and my stomach took a few more days to recover.
5
My girlfriend and I went to Equinox for early dinner, we were greeted by their service staff and they do remember our names which makes you feel very home-coming. We were given a window seat and the view was awesome looking over the marina bay area. The food was great and came in a good portion
5
Known for its incredible city view from the 70th floor of Swissôtel, this restaurant offers a great ambience. One can enjoy the view of the icons such as the Singapore river and Marina Bay Sands while having an à la carter with a buffet of sushi, starters and desserts. The food at Equinox is really good (always done very precisely).
4
Needless to say at level 70, the view is simply fantastic! The service is very good too, with attentive staff clearing away the plates very fast. I ordered the slow cooked beef short ribs which was tender and juicy. Really yummy! At first we didn't notice the salad buffet which was tucked in a corner above the dessert. Be sure to get the very nice selection of salad and chees
5
We have been extremely surprised by the quality of the food in this restaurant. The view is magnificient and our dinner was really delicious. Innovative way of cooking, diversity of savors, we really enjoyed our meal. The temperature of the room could have been a bit warmer from my point of view (but that's just me)
4
So, there is no doubt that the view is one of the best views is the world - it is 'world class'. But this is a restaurant so you are here for the food. And the food is excellent however not really 'world class' - but I stress that the food is excellent; the service is ok, but not excellent. For the cost, everything should be world class. Firstly two small pieces of fairly plain bread arrived on a bed of pebbles - very odd we thought- we asked for more and received it! We had excellent appetizers of crab and raw fish - both excellent (OK may be better than that) and main of chateaubriand which was also excellently cooked. But the side dishes of vegetables were small, the sauces were mediocre and not hot enough. The chocolate ganache we shared for pudding was very good indeed / may be excellent! The wine list is very extensive and very expensive. Some would say you might need a small mortgage to get a really decent bottle! The service was good but not of a fine dining quality. It was difficult to get the waiters attention to get the bill at the end. Our waitress/waiter changed at the pudding stage which is not de-rigueur!! S$400+ for two persons, 2.5 courses and a low end bottle of wine (S$80)The air con was on full and the restaurant was very cold.So for the cost we paid, I would expect outstanding food and service to match the view. And this wasn't quite the case. Equinox lacked that 'je ne sais quoi' (apart from the view!!)
5
Excellent service and view.
This restaurant seems to be always fully booked so make sure you book earlier to get window seats.
5
Very good service, with complimentary birthday cake and desserts. Service staff was attentive as well.
2
There was not much varieties of food to enjoy. It's a very sad meal. There is not enough staff at the restaurant to attend to the needs of diners. Beverage were restricted to one per person.
5
Equinox has Very Nice view from 70 floor! friendly staff and fabulous wine!
We will visit again definitely!
5
We thoroughly enjoyed our experience at the Equinox Restaurant. The food, wine and all the staff were of the upmost quality. We had the 5 course meal, paired with the wine selection and found it to be beyond 5 star. The staff were an absolute delight and made us feel very welcome, including a beautiful surprise at the end of our meal with a hand written "Happy 30th Anniversary" celebratory piece of cake on a plate. The views from this restaurant are beyond what we could have imagined and we were encouraged to walk through the dining area to take in the spectacular views. Staff even offered to take photos of us to give us a wonderful memory of the evening. Each return to Singapore will include a special visit to the Equinox, thank you for the experience!
5
Equinox has an impeccable city view, perfect for a romantic dating. We've had foie gras & Chateaubriand beef steak - excellent medium-rare cook ! The atmosphere was great, quiet with nice music even through the place was fairly packed in a Tuesday night. However the service was a bit slow (actually was too slow :-s). Our bread was served slightly charcoaled over the skin with melted butter and we have to wait half an hour for them to serve the bread so it was not really a good start for us. So if you plan to have a dinner there remember to ask them for chilled butter for a perfect dining experience! ;)
5
I done at Equinox at least once every two months. Love the view and ambience. Service is a little inconsistent but generally good. Sushi has improved tremendously over the past year. I own a dining card so with the half price discount, it is considered reasonable for a semi buffet.
4
I went there for lunch with two friends using the Amex credit card for 33% discount. The buffet was very good with fresh oysters, prawns, crabs and shell fish. There was also a good sushi and sashimi spread with soba noodles, For mains, I chose the grilled Barramundi on risotto, my friends had salmon and pork belly. They were done well. The fruits and dessert spread were adequate. The dates were excellent. I also liked the earl grey panna cotta and chocolate mousse cake. The view was great from the restaurant. For lunch, you may want to choose a table away from the windows, it may be too glaring for you. The staff was friendly and cleared the plates fairly quickly. Even though the meal came with coffee or tea, it was not offered until we have to look for wait staff to request for it. The green tea was very dilute. All in all, a nice place for lunch as the view was great and the food ample
5
I booked a special meal for my Wife and I on our Honeymoon stopover in Singapore. I had read about the views beforehand and they were even better in real life. I requested a table by the Window as I wanted the meal to be special because it was our Honeymoon, I was told that this would cost and additional $20 SGD which I don't think the Restaurant should charge to be honest. Once the bill came I could see that the Window charge had been written off which was a nice touch. The food was incredible, my Wife had the Duck which was so flavoursome and I had the Steak which was excellently cooked and tasted fantastic! For dessert we had an interesting chocolate combination with truffle ice cream which was the only let down of the meal, it must be an acquired taste! The meal was expensive, I think it ended up costing around $350 SGD for two main courses, a dessert and a nice bottle of wine, but definitely worth it for the amazing food and a view that has to be one of the best in Singapore
4
The view without a doubt is fantastic, a photographer dream on a clear and cloudless day at night. Ambience, service is good as expected. The food is pretty good BUT for the price that you pay for the main course, it is not really worth it. The lamb that we ordered was around $70 if I recall and all I had was 2 small medallion (which I think is about the size of one Cheryl Koh's tarte) and a couple of tiny sides like samosa . it was good though but certainly not worth the price that you are paying. Better go to Wooloomooloo for a great steak with similar cost. I guess you are just paying the extra for the view. And from what I am told, at times, you will need to pay extra for a window seat !!??. If you are a member or some sort you get some discount. But membership is about $400 with other perks (you will need to calculate if you will max out the membership cost). Well, I guess one can dine at Equinox for the experience or for that special occasion. For me, once is enough. For the view, may be better to pay $23 to go to the Skypark at MBS, and with the food price, I think you can get a bigger portion with similar quality elsewhere
4
We were provided with a bird's eye view of singaore's city scape. It would have been better if we could be sitted nearer to the glass. The services provided there was also top notched and the food was great.
4
Equinox makes one feel special. The ambience is conducive for tete-a-tete. Food is delicious. And I really like how the menu is lit for easy reading. The only bugbear is the $20 surcharge for a table by the window, but it is fair I guess.
4
Food presentation can be improved portion ok, choice are limited. View are nice with background soothing music. Beverages choice are limited.
4
Food varieties and environment are good. A perfect ambience for a group gethering or entertaining foreign guests.

Decided to use my Amex Love Dining privilege here for a weekday semi bufffet set lunch with a friend. With 50% off for 2pax, the total bill was only $70 ie $35 each. Superb value!What you get: a fantastic view, a choice of main course from 5, appetizer + dessert buffet + 1 order of coffee or tea. The highlight of the lunch was the seafood. Not alot of places serve seafood for lunch, and at the price, the value is unbeatable! Oysters, clams, mussels, prawns, crabs - all of that! There were also cheeses, breads, soups, etc. Sushi, sashimi, soba too.Service was really good and attentive. All the staff made you feel really taken care of all the time.Honestly, I wouldn't have paid the full price without the Amex promo though. But if you do, its worth a shot anytime!
4
Views are breathtaking, and a reason alone to go and visit for a special occasion. You will have a memorable time for this reason alone. However, the food was sadly only OK: small plates lacking any real style or panache. Furthermore, the quality of the interior design was not what one would expect from a top restaurant and let the venue down
5
Apart from the breathtaking vieuw of Singapur, the very good food, the tastful Interior we enjoyed an excellent service from the Filipina Marites well founded wine knowledge, pleasing manners, cordial and special,She gave us the feeling to be welcomed. Although we are travelling a lot we will never forget this beautiful evening
5
Apart from the breathtaking view of Singapur, the very good food and wine, the tastful interior, we enjoyed an exellent service. Marites, a Filipina with profound wineknowledge, fine manners, very cordial and special, gave us the feeling to be special too. Although we are traveling a lot , this evening will last unforgettable
5
Great experience there will my girlfriend for her birthday dinner, from level 70 looking down you can see the view of our CBD district and marina sand bay. Have to top up $20 for window view, but worth it. Great service from the service crew. Thank you
5
I came here with my fiancée for my birthday celebration.I will like to commend the restaurant manager, Jason Andre Chua, for his impeccable service and attitude. Jason hosted us and took care of the menu for our entire evening. As my fiancée has certain food allergies, Jason was very meticulous and got the kitchen to prepare specific dishes suitable for my fiancée. He was also there to recommend us the different types of wine to pair with the food. At the end of the dinner, the dessert came with a lighted candle and the words "Happy Birthday" written on it, which I thought was a really nice gesture. The service was exquisite, the food was delicious, the wine was awesome and the night was just so wonderful. It is indeed one of the best fine dining experience I have ever had so far. If you are looking to impress your date or want to have a romantic dinner, Equinox is definitely the place to go
5
If you're looking for a restaurant where you can impress and make your girl Awww, equinox is a really promising choice. The view, quality of service, atmosphere is superb
4
Is good for dinner view.. Food is good.. Waitress is friendly.. I like this place.. U can look singapore marIna view...
5
I had a formal business lunch there and regardless from the price (it's obviously an elegant place), the quality of the buffet was incredible.
The desserts are a must, there is no excuse to say no to them otherwise you can regret it forever.
5
We went to Equinox for a Sunday brunch and it was fantastic. Great food, wonderful service and an amazing view. They were also fantastic about understanding my shellfish allergy. They even individually prepared some food for me to prevent contamination.
5
I was amazing experience being over there with friend on New Asia Pub, House drink served was very good and crowd was dancing with high energy levels and high spirits.
Must see in singapore
5
Staying at the Swissotel avoids the additional charge of $20.00 for a table by the window.Because we were celebrating an anniversary the restaurant provided a complimentary slice of chocolate cake. In addition they serve a complimentary dessert plate after dinner with cookies/candies.They do charge $5.00 per person for free pour water, which we found more common at the better restaurants.If you are handicapped or have difficulty with stairs this is not the restaurant for you. Many stairs and 2 flights just to get to a restroom. But the views are fabulous! Dinner was excellent and a romantic place to celebrate a special event
2
There with wife, so company was great. The view was fantastic too. The food was OK as expected. But whereas the Waiter was very good when he was at our table, the service got very slow and inattentive. Maybe they are short on staff and just couldnt cope as more diners arrived and had to be served too. It was so slow that once we managed to get hold of the desert menu and then had decided what we wanted, after trying for ages trying to get anyone's eye to order, we lost our appetite for deserts and coffee. So when we managed to collar someone, we just asked for the bill and left. My main regret is that I didn't get them to minus off a portion of the service charge. Not recommended. For the view you can go to one of the other outlets at top of Swissotel or if you have to go to Equinox, reserve a table and just get drinks, then pay and go without having to endure a full evening of their service.
5
We had a family brunch and while expensive, it was well worth the price. From the friendly greeting on arrival, to the helpful and attentive wait staff, we progressed thru a tasty meal with a large variety of choices as well as some additional options ordered directly from the kitchen. We all had plenty of champagne as well as wine with our mealBeautiful view of the city while you have a wonderful time
3
should be fours stars for the view and service. these two factors help, but the food is not as good as I expected for the price, so it's not really a good value. the bar is beautiful with huge windows 60+ floors about Singapore. getting there at sunset when the lights of the city start coming on is definitely worth itI realize drink pours in the U.S. are super generous, but a martini here was tiny. I bet it was just one ounce. I forget how much each drink was, but remember thinking it was not at all worth itthe fish was good, seemed fresh. and service was 4-star. but I'd set your expectations accordingly, i.e., you come here for a special occasion when you can sit by the window, but not for the highest level of fine dining or valu
5
Dined here as a family for our 10th anniversary. We got a window seat in a quiet spot with stunning views over the Marina Bay. The children were happy with their selection of spaghetti with fresh tomato sauce. We had the Duck Breast and Black Cod both of which were fantastic. For dessert we couldn't go past the selection plate glad we did it was amazing and we both loved everything on the plate which is unusual for us. Service was as you would expect but the staff went beyond to make sure the kids were enjoying their meal and provided them with a small gift after dessert
5
Magnificent view, great service and well composed food allowing you appreciating the time. I enjoyed the evening during my stopover.
5
Went to Singapore for my girlfriend birthday, Equinox was absolutely the best place for that.Don't know from where to start, service? Staff? Food? View ?All was more than perfect.All my emails were replied within an hour some of them less than an hour.I requested for window table and once we arrived the table was waiting for us.The manager there (I wish to remember his name) he was just unbelievable, very friendly, very will English spoken, they offered us a cake with the name of my girlfriend on it.I'm really surprised with some reviews where some them they have mentioned the food is not great, I'm sorry the food was awesome.Best place to go to.Thank you for all the team one by one 
5
The view is incredible and the service matches it. Both ordered steak and bots cuts were cooked to perfection and very tasty. Ask to be seated next to the window overlooking the marina bay sands, very romantic and very private. Service was very attentive and immediately responded to a minor inconvenience. Was my birthday and they gave me a complimentary piece of cake, very thoughtful. Thank you to the team for a memorable evening. Very recommended for couples
2
The restaurant is located at the 70th floor of the Swiss hotel with a view to the marina area similar to flyer view ..There is no way to get a table next to the window and the place is arranges in multiple layers with a high separation walls blocking the view .The food is 30% more expensive than spago at the Marina sand bay or Lantern at the Fullerton hote
5
Loved the view, the food and service! Lovely server offered us a complimentary slice of dark chocolate cake upon realizing that we are celebrating for a salary increment. It was unexpected and a really sweet gesture!
5
Serve one of the best meal you can get in the republic, coupled with fantastic view of the skyline, with Marina Bay Sands in the backdrop, Esplanade, Singapore Flyer, and many other iconic buildings that give Singapore its status on the world map. Great hospitality from the staffs, with amazing collection of wine
5
This restaurant must have the most amazing view in all of Singapore. It has views in all directions, and from year one can see the various landmarks.A restaurant with views of course would not be complete if you did not have wonderful food. Fortunately this restaurant also has a wonderful selection of food to complete the ambience and dining experience. I attended this restaurant recently for lunch, whereupon there was a fixed main course from an ala carte menu and starter and desert from the buffet bar. I choose the salmon for the main course which was excellent.We didn't manage to get a seat by the window, but notwithstanding the view from our table was still very good. It overlooked the War Memorial Park, from the table adjacent to the window. The meeting was not expensive at Singapore standards and the service was first rate.Would be happy to return to this restaurant any time given the fine dining experience that we received
4
This has to be one of the best Top Florr restuatnts around. The views of Singapore at night are aweinspiring.We chose the 5 course set menu, which was nice, but not sure it was value for money. Glad I prepaid and got $50 off per person otherwise it would have been disappoting for $180 per person. The service was good and the wine list was comprehensive, but on the high side. Think they are making the most of the location for the prices.It was an enjoyable evening and recommend you try it at least once
4
Had dinner at the Equinox,the mushroom soup with pieces of mushroom was really good, best mushroom soup I have tasted so far. For the main course I had the roast chicken while my daughter had the lamb,also was good.She ordered aside, the mashed potatoes which she said simply melts in your mouth so smooth... The view was amazing we had the view of Marina Bay Sands and its surrounding
3
The Equinox on Level 70 has stunning views and is a wonderful venue for a bite to eat. The Sunday Brunch offers free-flowing Moet, which was superb. And the staff are extremely attentive and courteous. However, if you're a vego like me, the food selection isn't really value for money. The cuisine is supposed to be modern European but the vast spread of sushi and sashimi wasn't consistent with that... There were roast meats but I was warned away from the roast veggies because they hadn't been cooked separately. So there was a soup, a couple of salads and some dessert available on the buffet for my $158++. I asked the chef for some pasta and received chewy spagetti with canned tomatoes - though my vego friend received a nice-looking wild rice risotto with mushrooms. I should have had that! So, if you're vego, go to the Equinox for an a la carte meal and enjoy the superb views and service with something reasonable to eat. Equinox, would you like to consider more options for vegetarians at your champagne brunch? May I suggest roast vegetables cooked separately to meat, more salads, and a choice of 2 or 3 cooked-to-order options perhaps
5
Experience at Equinox was awesome, the staff know their things well, and the view is spectacular! It is a great place to celebrate bday or anniversary.
5
We booked the Sunday buffet.A classy venue with a relaxed vibe and buffet food presentation that will have you salivating and drawing your attention away from the spectacular view. If you book the champagne package drinks flow freely plus there are cocktails and other drinks if you wish.A definite must do, even inspiring enough alone to encourage a return trip to Singapore
5
This restaurant is on the 69th floor of the Swissotel on Stamford and presents it patrons with an amazing view of Singapore. To complement this amazing view at this restaurant is equally great staff. The food also complement the experience. It offers a good selection to satisfy most taste and all my guests (from various nationalities) found something on the menu to their liking
5
The dishes were well-garnished but taste was just average. The view was beyond comparison but there was an extra charge of SG$20. Overall speaking, that was a worth-the-while experience:
4
Great food and ambience. The view of Singapore was stunning at night. The service was good but at times it was hard to get the attention of the stewards. But the birthday cake for my wife was delightful and greatly appreciated.
4
This place has a great view over the city, from the 70th floor. We had a nice table at the window so we could enjoy some nice drinks. Nice place
4
Sound levels here have gone up, which used to have a much more reserved crowd. My husband was somewhat ruffled initially because it was my birthday dinner, but we learned to listen to what other tables were discussing. Food-wise, we ordered the free-range chicken and lamb saddle, both of which were tender and quite exquisite, priced at $60+. Our food took awhile to arrive but the restaurant thoughtfully provided bite-sized tastings while we awaited the mains. The view was gorgeous and the ambient music was a classical-chillout as well as an occasional french song. Service staff were smart and considered our simple requests such as gluten-free bread. A good experience. Will be back
5
Very luxurious bar on the 70th floor with comfortable seating and a stunning view over singapore. Very polular, so booking in advance on busy days is recommended. Food and drinks are very pricey, but as the great view is included it is definitely worth it. Altough when busy, the food takes quite some time, it was very tast
3
Food is average. Be sure to get a seat next to the window if not the price of the food would not be justified
3
This restaurant has very good view .... Food is average and service is ok.. The lunch semi buffet is very reasonably priced
5
The view was great and the food although pricey, taste great as well. My girlfriend and I truly enjoyed the whole dining experience.
5
Ok so this is a bit more expensive than we'd usually go to but it was our last night of a 4 week European sojourn so we decided to spend it in style at Equinox at our hotel.A few of tips-Make a reservation so you get a window tableDress code for men requires long pants & covered shoesTry to get there before sunsetTo get to the restaurant you need to take a special elevator from the ground floor.Once there you are greeted & shown into the restaurant but your eyes are immediately drawn to the magnificent view & this is what dominates your evening.We chose the seafood platter for 2 & as lovers of seafood both agreed it was a wonderful meal.We watched the sun set then the lights of the city slowly come on.It was a wonderful evening & worth ever dollar
3
You must go there for the view. It is probably the best one in Singapore.It is really stunning.Food wise you will be disappointed. Looks like a gastronomic restaurant but it is absolutely not.Service is dedicated but not so professional. At 10 pm they started to move table around and probably setting for a function on the next day.It is very pricey for what you are eating.At the end a must try but do not expect to eat very well
4
I've been to Equinox many times over the years. It serves a semi buffet for lunch. The style of food is mixed, leaning towards western. I wouldn't say the food was delicious. But it's certainly more than acceptable for the $59++ price of the semi-buffet. People go mainly for the ambience I guess. It is high ceilinged with large windows up on level 70. The view gives you a very good feeling indeed. Your guests will usuall be inpressed. Especially if they are from overseas. The furniture has seen better days. The service is pleasant. But the wait staff tend to be rotated. I think they are trying not to increase the price in expensive Singapore and so some corners are being cut. Just went earlier this week and noticed that ice cream has changed to some soft serve concoction. The foie gras preparation used to come in a little jar. It's now cut into minuscule little squares. 1cm square? Oh yes. You're limited to just ONE cup of tea or coffee. They've been doing this for years. Not very generous. Nevertheless, I will return
3
You cannot beat the view specially at night. I strongly suggest you make reservations for a decent spot and a nice view. The service is very good but as I would expect for what you pay. Which is somewhat the downside, is not cheap, but then again is an unbeatable location.
4
Our team went there for a high tea for our year-end celebration. Reservation is required. Since it was mid-December already, the area was a bit crowded. The view is spectacular, from 70th floor. You can see the touristy thing around Singapore. When we went in, there is a burning smell, and throughout our 2-hrs or more there, we were trying to find the source of the burning smell.On the other hand, the high tea spread was very nice. You can mentioned to them your requirements like if you are vegetarian or allergic to this and that and they will adjust the choices to your liking or requirement. The staff are very professional and attentive.In general, the place looks elegant. Have superb food and very attentive staff. But it was a bit pricey. But maybe once in a while, we can indulge..
4
Enjoyed brunch on Sunday at Equinox. Obviously a magnificent view which definitely adds something to the event. Two things to note:a. The service we received was absolutely first class. Our vegetarian guests were treated with considerable respect and attention to detail. Thanks!b. Most of the food was 'good to very good' category (quantity was no problem at all, staff kept it coming) except for their crabs. Overcooked and mushy. Net/net, I would take international guests there again knowing they will enjoy the activity. But bring your wallet well-stocked. Not a 'cheap eat'!
5
They call this a semi buffet because the buffet line has cold cuts, seafood on ice, appetizers and deserts. There are no hot items except soup because the main course is a small portion of protein you order from the menu. This is not a buffet you stuff your face at, but a casual, elegant lunch that is pretty great for a quiet weekday lunch date.
3
Went there for a dinner. The views from the restaurant are breathtakingly beautiful even at night. You won't be able to see too far, but the lights are quite a sight. Service wise, it was not what you would expect from a fine dining establishment. Difficult to get the staff's attention and there isn't the warmth that is evident in other fine dining restaurants. The food was not bad, something different and some of it was pretty tasty. Prices for main courses average about 70 SGD thereabouts. The ambience in the restaurant was alright, dimly lit with candlelight (but for some reason our table didn't have one and we didn't bother to ask for one). It makes an effort to have a romantic relaxing atmosphere, but somehow, a sense of warmth was missing. This was probably due to the lack of hospitality
4
Went there for a dinner on Friday to celebrate a birthday.The good: amazing experience to board a dedicated elevator that whisks you (at speed) up 70 storeys to the restaurant. Breathtaking views over Singapore's Marina Bay.Service was also excellent. Staff were attentive but not intrusive. Always smiling. Faultless.The food was the main disappointment though. I felt it didn't live up to the hype and prices. Certainly it was good, but at a place such as Equinox, and paying those high prices, the expectations were raised.So despite the fact that I left the restaurant smiling, I couldn't help but feel a tad disappointed. Unlikely to visit again, at least in the near future

No more explanation!
Perfect itself!
For celebration, complimentary a piece of cake with lovely decoration was served by your such a kind staff.

Went there for drinks and obviously the view. Was just mind blowing!! If you're not a hotel guest (this restaurant is located on the 70th floor of Swissotel Stamford, you have to order minimum worth of SG 150. We did because drinks with snacks will easily cost 200+. Was worth every penny. Snacks especially the satay was delicious. The mezzanine platter was good too. Will definitely go back again

I have been to this restaurant twice or thrice per year, for many years. And each time, I come off feeling gastronomically blown away and pleased with the level and quality of customer service that each staff at Equinox has given generously to my family/date. However, my recent experience with the restaurant, though still palatably great, has left me with doubts as to the standard and value of their customer service. The absence of any truly experienced, or conscientious serving staff have made the dining experience seem slightly more mediocre than it should be. Although not a complete disappointment, it is indeed sad to come back to find that the overall dining experience is marred by the dutiful lack of service and inexperience towards the fine dining etiquettes by the staff appropriated there.

My spouse and I visited the restaurant for Sunday brunch. The view from the 70th floor was amazing. The lunch buffet was splendid: oysters on the half shell, boiled prawns, sushi and sashimi, mussels, clams, lobster, prime rib, salmon, chicken, duck breast, fried rice, noodles, pork cooked in a coconut sauce and very tasty and tender, roasted potatoes, beetroot salad, green salads, breads, asparagus and mushrooms. Every seafood we sampled was well chilled and fresh. The meats were tender and juicy. Some of the f the desserts were not to our liking, not because they were not good, we just did not care for the specific combination of ingredients. Staff was attentive, a musical duo was performing, they were good. There was a young magician who visited tables

Been here a few times. always memorable . Service a tad slow.. food quality made up for it. The oysters were fresh...the ponzu dressing going very well on it. Foie gras tender and well seared. Black cod was exceptipnal. Star for me was the monkfish catch of the day.The dessert platter is a good way to dip ur fingers into all they hav in terms of sweets. Sommelier recommended a nice French cab sav dat went down well.

My partner and I came here for the pre-theatre set menu on sat night and we were both happy with what we had.She ordered the soup, snapper and mousse.I had the salmon, beef short ribs and tart.Dishes were presented beautifully, we enjoyed the soup, need short ribs and tart the most.Aside from the well prepared food, the experience of being on the 70th floor was amazing. Service was excellent at the same time with 2 other couples dining during this perio
3
I went for buffet lunch, the spread is simple; not much food variety. The "fresh" salmon & other raw food was not fresh at all, as they have been cut & left at the cold corner. "Ba Ku Tea" was with pork cutlet, soup & a few slices of big onion, no "Tea" at all, it should be called "Ba Ku Soup"! Beverages are plain water, coffee and tea only, additional charge apply for 2nd cup of coffee or tea! Seriously, this is 1st time I heard from a buffet restaurant in Singapore. Staff was attentive and friendly.Only have great view.Not value for money
5
As a famile of four we visited Equinox, as we stayed at Swissotel Stamford and as we lived in S'pore 20 years ago and first visit since then, remembering the fantastic view from 70th floor.The food was simply superb.As appetizers we shared burrata and prawn. Both very tasty.For Maincourse my sons had ribeye perfectly cooked.My wife had monk fish (catch of the Day) and I had the lobster. Both dishes were great.For dessert we had choko ganache and ivory choko mousse. Yummi ;-)All food was excellent.Service was very good.When booking a table remember it has to be at the Windows - this makes a huge difference to the experience.Somewhat to pricey, however it was a awesome dinner to us.By the Way, when staying at Swissotel, you have 20% discount on food
5
What do you look out for in a good restaurant? Consistently good quality of food? They've got it!Nice ambience? Great view from 70th floorImpeccable service? Very attentive staffReasonable price? If you have far card!Love their new menu (the physical menu). It's lit and thus user friendly especially in a warm dark cosy setting such as this.Highly recommended for special occasion, meeting of clients and even casual lunch

The Equinox sits atop Swissotel, The Stamford, commanding the best view of Marina Bay and actually looks down on the towering Marina Bay Sands hotel! I've been dining here from the time it was called the Compass Rose. Both restaurant & hotel have changed management over the decades. So, why this review? Because I just had the best meal I've ever had at this restaurant a week ago. The lobster was succulent, sweet and combined with a delicious sauce. The tasty dessert sampler tray feeds 4 adults to excess. The food & service is easily Michelin-recommended quality & competitive with the best restaurants at the Sands. The restaurant is expensive but a wallet wound can be avoided with the FAR dining card. Lunch is a semi-buffet, with high quality produce and the same quality of cuisine as dinner but is more reasonably priced and with the same unmatched views. Ask for a table by the window and remember to cancel your appointments for the rest of the afternoon
5
Thank you for everything. Excellent service with gorgeous view. Your staff went the extra mile by taking note today was my birthday. Greatly appreciated.
5
Catch of the day was amazingly presented with delicious garnishes. Chocolate ganache with truffle ice cream was perfect. Service was just right. And the views not bad...
5
Excellent service! The service team were very accommodating. We had a seat with a view and as the sun set the skyline was so beautifully lit. The food was excellent and the happy birthday detail was unexpected. Great ambience.
5
Truly a la cart, the food was beautiful to look at and just amazing to eat. My gluten free dietary requirement was absolutely no problem. The wait staff although friendly were a little slow, my husband asked for the cheese plate instead of a sweet dessert and it just never turned up, not sure what happened??Despite that we would go again for a special occasion.
5
Yes it is expensive, but the service, food quality and view more than make it feel like value for money. Quite simply the best champagne brunch in Singapore with undoubtedly the best view of the city. Service is top notch with waiters refilling glasses as soon as your back is turned. You get exactly what you pay for.
5
Went to Equinox for an anniversary lunch with the wife and the place is consistently good over the years. The semi buffet is good although the main course choices could be changed more regularly. But it was a very nice touch that they gave us a nice slice of cake to celebrate our anniversary.
4
My wife and I were celebrating our 30th wedding anniversary dinner and decided to hold it at Equinox. Although we have been there for lunches before, it's the first time we were having dinner there. The daytime views from the 70th level of Swissotel The Stamford is breathtaking, but the night time views are equally spell-binding. We were given a table by the window facing Marina Bay, the Marina Bay Sands and the magnificent skyline of the financial district. Service, as expected, was very good. The staff working our section were knowledgeable, attentive and very courteous. Food delivery was prompt and the quality of the food matched our expectations. Food presentation was attractive and creative. Our daughter brought a good camera and took many memorable photos, made more special by the spectacular backgrounds from almost every angle. It was an evening which we truly enjoyed and will remember for some time to come. Thank you
4
Overall a very good experience and very affordable with 'the far card'. I had the new york strip steak which i would not actually recommend, quite tough, the fillet is much nicer. My partner had the miso cod which was excellent, very well cooked. Service was attentive and overall food quality is a level above our previous visit. Will certainly return
4
Had a enjoyable birthday lunch semi buffet with my wife. The spread is simple but good. The prawns are really sweet and fresh, much better than what you can get at other restaurants. The dessert are good as well. As others have mention, the view is indeed good!
4
I had a pre- birthday for my sister hereGreat view and delicious food. Service was good but it was annoying that they don't serve tap water and insist you buy water ! I didn't mind paying S $$$$ for a main but it irked me that they charged minimum S $ 5 for water !Overall nice meal with a breadth taking view. Nice cocktails.
1
Cafeteria style at five star pricing. Hard to see the view because the windorws were completely fogged. Service friendly but not good. Food ordinary and served either lukewarm to cold or microwaved burning hot. Substandard all round.
5
This is our favourite lunch semi buffet with an amazing view of Singapore! Start with Oysters/Seafood, Sashimi/Sushi, soups, salads; order your main course including foie gras add on option; finish off with your desserts, fruits, cheeses!
5
Some the best views of Singapore can be yours with a high quality meal and wine, We just love this spot for its great food and views
1
An affront.The dress code was the only thing that provided a standard and that was brought through the door by the clientelle who no doubt exited as we did bilious and outraged that payment,let alone such exhorbitant payment was required for the galling experience foisted on unsuspecting punters .Be warned ,if you are used to the food delights Singapore typically offers this is the utter exception in every respect.Cafeteria tables,lukewarm soup,carpaccio hidden in limp garnish and obscured by a flood of seemingly off the shelf dressing in which it had apparently been soaking since the time of Noah,The only effect on the palate was the scalding from the reheated rice.An assault but not on the senses.The "bellini" was apparently a drink,the beer was warm but thankfully came in a bottle as did the French wine served halfway through the main .The only releif was that the sides ordered were not provided otherwise there may have been an even greater range of culprits for this mornings random need to excuse oneself.When asked the honest feedback was met with panic .Compensation in the form of more "food" and "drink" completely missed the point as this ,ultimately,cannot really be a restaurant but instead a viewing platform where poor saps are held hostage 70 floors up.When it became apparent that we did not want anyhting more our credit card was finally returned and we fled.Oh,the view of course,the view.For a table by the window there is an extra fee.That ,in the end was waived but not for the reason expected.The "view" on this night was utterly obscured by the fogged up windows.Peering at the panorama and light show was like peering into Leonardo and Kates car during that moment in Titanic,I expect this overhyped travesty to meet a similar end.The landlord should let someone else have a go immediately
4
Staff was attentive and friendly; had a short chat with him about his recent oversea trip. Also shifted us to a window seat when it was vacant (perhaps due to the fact that the restaurant was not crowded on the day we visited and that the next time we might pay the extra $20 for a window seat) but it was a very nice gesture.Sides come in very generous portions but the steak I order was way too salty for my preference. I really liked the rosemary bread, though:) they also serve truffle ice cream, which tastes like hazelnut vanilla complimented by truffle and for some reason it cleanses your palate; truly amazing.Very comfortable setting. My partner has been here several times over the years and he keeps coming back; I don't see a reason not to:
4
A special place for a special dinner.Food quality was very good, the service incredibly friendly (albeit food delivery was a tad slow). The price was a bit on the high side & had initial slight bill shock.However, the topic of conversation I could hear on a number of tables was around the various discounts being provided for certain credit cards/banks etc. With the discount I (unknowingly) was provided at receipt signing, this also became excellent value for money
4
I made a reservation for two and we came on time, we catch the sunset view but we failed to take photo as we are assisted by the host to our designated table, not bad on our view and we got nothing to say just only "wow" what a view. The staff were friendly and help us to choose wine. Only a lil bit expensive but worthy on our food, salad was great but sour, suggest to have some options for the dressing, the Foie Grass fantastic and the John stone steak perfect match for the truffle sauce? not sure about that. We received a complimentary bday cake, appreciate it big time. We will come back definitely and hope we can have the seat with the sunset view
4
We went for brunch The food was very good They did not have the chocolate fountain as seen in photos the selection of food seemed spread out to look like there was more. The deserts were very nicely done. I have been to better ones allot cheaper. You were drinking MoÃ«t and a few cocktails were included. You can't beat the view it was amazing. Would I go again I don't think so it's a one of for that price
2
Recently celebrated my birthday on a quiet note with my husband and a very special friend. I was surprised to see the variety of buffet shrunk to only seafood and sashimi and some desserts for the same price as last year, when we celebrated father's day with at least 10 of us.Thought the view is unchangeable and fantastic but that is not just the reason we go there for. The food used to be very good years back with the signature dish "chillie crab."They have promised me a small piece of cake since it is my birthday, but they have forgotten. I didn't want to ask because I don't want to behave cheapskate in front of my friend. I am sorry they have to do something about their service and the food, or they might loose a lot of their frequent patron. :
5
Took a business acquantance from outside Singapore for a special dinner and view of the city...best location available. Prices are high, but food and service was exceptional. Was not happy when family with small and screaming children were placed next to us, but staff quickly offered a new table.
5
You have to be there for the 360 degree view of Singapore.. It is on the 69th Floor and simply amazing.
Food is also good ...
5
Awesome view at the window seat. Food variety can be improved. Service was great and environment was nice.
3
Situated on the highest floor of Swissotel Stamford building, restaurant provided excellent views. Food was just OK for the price.
5
Very Good view window side table, and good dishes
and good service...
next time would like to go,too.
3
This is a very high profile restaurant and nothing is cheap. The service and the location were to die for but the food was average. We ordered a lot of seafood, lobster was overcooked, sashimi wasn't 100% fresh. I mean it wasn't bad, but for the price we expected excellence
4
It's convenient, and slick. Nice little alcoves makes this seemingly plain lobby bar into something more than average. The Corpse Reviver was a delish, not-too-sweet herby broth that revived my jet-lagged person. Served with olives and house-made potato chips. My companion, a Singapore-dweller, frequents this haunt due to hop-notch bartender staff
5
This is a very pricey restaurant but if you want to impress someone, this is the place to go. The food is excellent fine dining western fare. The service is impeccable and the restaurant is quiet and romantic. This restaurant is good for romantic dinners or business meetings - not your rowdy restaurants. The food and plating very high quality. Those who are penny pinching should not come here. The food and breath taking views are a great experience and top restaurant in Singapore. I will return again and again if there is an occasion or an important dinner to impress!
1
Didnt go here at all eventually. I remember reading another review about the staff here relying on the amazing view to do everything for them. Sure enough, despite dozens of calls, no one ever got back to me....Instead Indochine at SuperTree (Gardens by the Bay) turned out so much better. But that's another review...
5
Afternoon tea is ~$50 SGD for two people. This is a great deal, considering Equinox is higher than the Singapore Flyer, and you can take your time enjoying views of Marina Bay Sands and the important buildngs in Singapore. I made a reservation 1 week ahead of time, and got a window view (with no extra charge.)The tea set is a snack rather than a full meal. Scones with clotted cream and jam, 3 types of sandwiches, and various deserts
5
This restaurant, which gets less hype than the newer places in town, has the best aerial view of Singapore - you get to see the landmarks and scenery from the best angles. The view can be enjoyed from many tables as the restaurant is large and spread out, has a stepped lay out and floor to ceiling windows. Yesterday we visited for tea. There is a la carte menu and a set menu. We chose the tea set (standard set at $45++ serves 2 persons), which came in 3 tiers consisting of scones, mini cakes and an assortment of sandwiches. The small size was welcome as we could try a greater variety of items. We have come here more times than we can remember for various meals times. It is always a pleasant experience
4
Food was good but below expectations. Service again below what is expected from a top rated restaurant. Good panoramic view of Singapore and good ambiance.
5
Ordered 2 Vegetarian Dishes, they were pretty good.
Staff was warm and friendly.
Must visit for special occasions.
5
Good view, great buffet selection. We were impressed by the international cheese selection, mains (we had pork belly) and the dessert in particular.
4
Good ambience and service, which is really nice to host overseas guests. Will definitely come back again.
5
The restaurant with the best view of Singapore! Child-friendly. Large portions for kids menu. My 2.5 yo totally enjoyed the 2 hr dining experience too!
3
There was a $10 surcharge for secretary's week. However, nothing added on to commemorate the occasion to justify the extra $10. Appetisers and desserts were varied. Crabs were not as fresh as expected. View was excellent of course. Even though they knew that it was our wedding anniversary, they did nothing to add an extra touch to our lunch.
4
So maybe not with Whoopi Goldberg but still- that is pretty much all there is! To sit at that height and watch Singapore is absolutely wonderful. If you are vegetarian (sorry friend X) there were very few options. Thankfully, she was no fuss and had many helpings of pumpkin soup! For meaters- lovely sashimi, reasonable cold cuts! I think the icing is Champagne but as a recent teetotaler not much options to drink- no fresh juice. Dessert is lovely and service prompt. If I had to go again, it would be to gaze- the food would not drag me back
3
Amazing place, amazing view. Maybe because of that they don't bother much.Perhaps should have guessed when they don't bother to answer the phone, we neede to change the time. Phoned a dozen times, no answer. Then phoned the hotel itself and asked to be put through, twice, when put through line just went dead, twice.In the end e-mailed and they did answer.Then they did not have the window table we booked (it costs extra by the way). Then after about ten minutes I tried waving my menu in the air, it worked and we were able to order drinks.Then were assaulted by load music coming from a bar/club immediately above us.Not happy by this point and was sure we had made a big mistake with our choice of place to go.We were then rescued by a very nice, very polite, French, server who we assumed was the manager. He apologised for the noise (we had not raised it so obviously he noticed it himself), and offered to move us to a different table. A few minuites after we moved he came back and said a window table had come free, we moved again.He then recommended dishes and was most charming and helpful.On chatting we found out he was not the manager but a trainee, in Singapre for three months or so getting international experience.Lucky for them, without him it would have been one star for the view and a pretty black review.Well done Gabrielle, you saved the day
1
Even the top 10 best restaurants in Singapore do not have this stupid requirement that is sooo last century. Totally spoiled our celebration plan our mood!Please buy some fashion magazines and read! Formal or high class does not mean have to to be fully covered!!! If I can rate no star I would do so!!! I will never ever visit this place again!!
5
Had the unlimited champagne brunch on my recent trip to Singapore and it was really an outstanding experience. The location is amazing, with views across the city from the 70th floor of the Swissotel. The brunch itself was excellent with a huge range of high quality food on offer, including fresh oysters, sushi and roast meats. The champagne was generously poured and the service was attentive and very friendly. It was a real highlight of my stay in the city.
4
With the FAR card privileges, it's worth it to come back again. The grilled steak was tender and juicy. The cod fish was delicious! The view by the window was great, we took quite a few photos.
5
Requested for a child seat, of which they promptly provided.
The serving steward was very attentive to our needs.
3
The dishes was simple and a bit bland, for people who love less salt and a healthy meal, the semi lunch buffet would be perfect with a good variety of choices.
4
View is very good. Price is reasonable consider the venue. Their afternoon tea set cost 45 dollars (for 2 person). And you get extra discount when you use OCBC card or AMEX platinum card.
4
We made a late booking but was surprised at being allocated a window table.The view is what this place is all about,outstanding view across nighttime Singapore .The restaurant itself has a good ambience .The food was faultless ,excellent steaks.Maybe considered a bit expensive but this is Singapore .I did vote against ordering wine.The list is extensive and expensive .We were served by an attentive waitress ,very friendly .My only slight criticism would be a bit of a wait for the main course.
4
Even though we didn't get the window seat, the views were still very good as the tables are placed on slightly higher tiers. Amuse bouche of octopus crisp was interesting although abit salty. The foie gras with orange and rhubarb was excellent. We waited a while for our steak, which was good but could have been warmer when served. Do order the truffled macaroni cheese as the side when u go there, it's very good. :) We didn't get desserts, but received complimentary chocolates at the end of the meal.All in all, an excellent dinner complemented by the very hospitable service provided by the staff. Will be back in future to check out the high tea
5
First time for me, 3rd time for my wife. She made a reservation for a table by a window about 2 weeks prior and we got it with no problems. Some people say they have had problems but we did not. Anyway, the weather was good and the view was outstanding. The teas were good and the snacks were good but not excellent. It was, once seated, difficult to get anyone's attention at times except when it came time to pay up. Previously, my wife said the staff would come around 4:45pm to remind people they had to leave at 5pm. This day, Saturday, we were left in peace until shortly after 5. Overall, a good deal for the price but I suspect the view was worth more than the tea/snacks :
1
Really really disappointed by the service quality of the reservation staff. trying to make a reservation for a special event and the staff told me they can only take a reservation but not to guarantee a window seat. I thought that's the whole idea of making reservations!!! TO AVOID SUPRISES!!! and don't even get me mention the attitude of that staff, she seemed not interested at all and in a hurry to hang up my call. i almost wanted to yell at her. God knows what would the dining experience be!
5
We where pretty excited to visit Equinox and yes all was just right. Service is well versed and yes the food is pretty nice - beside some short fallings... However if one wants to spend about 300 dollar per person in this high rising restaurant its actually worth it. I personally don't appreciate the a bit Asian Style and aged design of the restaurant but yes - it looks like it still works... The view can be pretty much enjoyable if been seated close to a window. However nothing to complain about the food nor the service - its on the higher price side, but worth it
3
Wow - if you want a view of the city - regardless of what follows - this is the place.My guess is the management knows this which is why so little attention is paid to the service. I have never had such a nice restaurant have wait staff that were so amateurish - they really didn't know anything about fine dining, how to serve, etc. Our waitress was so green and inexperienced it was humorous. The food was ok. the foie gras was amazing -- the veal chop was really fatty - but the mushroom truffle sauce was great. The leak soup was flavorless. So the bottom line is a WOW for view and an OY for service and a SO SO for the food
5
Best cod fish ever, very tender and melting in the mouth. Every meal was delicious. Super view on the marina.
Good service.
Had a memorable diner as a couple.
4
The staff have the table decorated with colorful stars flake.
The service was good and we had a very pleasant evening.
5
It's definitely a great choice to go for.
Service are excellent, food quality are good, view is spectacular~
4
The food is fresh and plenty on offered. I enjoyed the fresh oyster and foie gras. The service is excellent.
3
It's a buffet lunch. No more mains. Just buffet. Good view for kids. And good service.
Thought the food was very similar to most buffets.
5
This restaurant has fantastic views over Singapore, including the iconic Marina Bay Hotel and the ferris wheel as well as the rest oft he city. It has a really cool bar for pre and post dinner drinks, get a table table for a great night out eating fine food and fine wine. As with most of Singapore its expensive so reserve for a special occasio
1
We were very excited about having dinner at Equinox with friends while we were in Singapore.We even went to the extent of paying the extra $10 for a view to Marina Bay.That's where the excitement ends. With the tables being at different tiers throughout the restaurant we basically had exactly the same view as anyone else, it was just that our table was slightly closer to the window.We ordered the seafood platter which arrived with the oysters missing and the rest of the seafood on offer being very sparse. This included three small, dried out prawns to share between two of us. The waitress returned to the table with our oysters and advised us that the chef had simply forgotten to put them on the platter. Well for $230 inclusive of the service fee and GST for the seafood platter alone we felt completely ripped off.I'll leave the pricing of the wine alone but needless to say it certainly wasn't a highlight.We left with a hefty bill of $440 per couple. We won't be returning and would certainly not want others to experience the same disappointment.
5
We had dinner here with friends on our first night in Singapore. There were fireworks in the harbor that night which we were able to watch from above. This restaurant is at the top of the tallest building in Singapore as of right now. The view is amazing. Our food was all prepared well and the service was very good. Our price point was about $150 before per person which is expensive to me but everything considered it was an excellent experience.
4
We had our farewell dinner to S´pore at the Swissotel Equinox and smilingly paid the 20 or so € to be seated at the window. Indeed the view is fantastic. Beforehand we had ordered a seafood platter for two, which was nice without being abundant. When we asked for a second crab fork to extract the crab and lobster meat, we were told, that there was none available. The dressings proved to be on the ordinary side. All this was compensated by the good service and the view, but for a restaurant mentioned in all travel guides there things left to be improved
5
Superb views across the City from our table by the window. Laser show made more dramatic with lightning in the background. However, the views came second place compared to the excellent food served by friendly, polite and knowledgeable waiting staff. All three courses were a delight, cooked to perfection. I would definitely recommend a visit
5
Good food, romantic ambience and attentive staff.
Went to celebrate my anniversary. The staff are knowledgeable and know the menu well. We got a window seat which we can have the full landscape view.
The smoked charcoal cow milk ice cream is Good
5
The restaurant is excellence with a group of very service oriented staff. Food was fantastics! Value for money.
3
We had dinner here and I was amazed with the great view from 70th floor. However can't say about the food choices. It was very limited. Other than than everything else was good. Oh yeah service was great too.
3
Why does the restaurant need my credit card details? There are a lot of identity theft around the world. Why would someone want their confidential info stored in the restaurant database? Decided to cxl the reservation for such information request.
5
The service was excellent. Staff constantly check on the comfort level of patron. To dine with breathtaking view of the city landscape, the sea and also the floating low clouds was awesome.The food was good but I feel that it a little bit pricy in terms of price vs portion
5
We had afternoon tea here. It was a lovely spread, more filling than you would imagine. The staff were exception.The price was also much more reasonable that I had imagined But the view is the highlight. Whilst we were there it started off fairly sunny with great views then the usual clouds came over and started to rain and it was just a lovely experience. If you haven't tried it you should if not just for the vie
5
Business dinner with 20 people. excellent food, wine and view. very enjoyable event with a great finish light show overlooking the marina and bay. service was excellent desserts were tasty and everyone left happy. the best view of Singapore without doubt. if your a local spend the SGD and come see your city at sunse
3
We immediately loved the view for this restaurant on the 70th floor of the SwissHotel on Stamford Street in Singapore. It will cost you an extra $20 to get a window table reservation but it is worth it. The menu is short but all of the choices are creatively designed to offer a variety of delights that will excite your palate. Our four guests all had something different and each was exceptional.The negatives from our party were as follows: The prices were in the atmosphere. Over $900 for party of four, but that did include $200 in wine, so $700 on food alone. This is pricy by any city standards. My other complaint is that there no white table clothes. Had I know this in advance I would never have booked. If you cannot afford white table clothes at those prices, something is very wrong. But, I am glad we chose the restaurant for the experience
5
Although I was excited for the visit to Equinox, I actually mentally prepared myself for less than amazing food due to mixed online reviews; many advised to go for the great ambience and view rather than the culinary experience and that the food was merely okay. I thought I’d try it out anyway though as the photos did look so spectacular and it would be the perfect setting for an anniversary date night. I’m so glad I did and I would wholeheartedly disagree with previously read reviews…FoodFrom the very first bite to the last my taste buds were delighted. The amuse bouche was a bacon and cheese flavoured croquette type thing (not the official name), which was the first indication I was in for a good night. Then the complementary bread came, which was like a brioche seasoned with maybe salt, pepper and garlic, but I’m not sure. It was really good though.I impressed myself for selecting one of the cheaper starters, which was the burrata with fresh tomato, shaved asparagus, mint, balsamic vinegar and sauce vierge. The cheese was satisfyingly creamy with a nice delicate flavour and it was complemented by the crisp tomatoes and crunchy asparagus.I followed that with the miso roasted black cod with sweet pickled vegetables, horseradish and edamame puree, which was just divine. Black cod is one of my favourite dishes to have in a restaurant, however it can be very rich and intense, but if you are worried about it being too rich, sweet or heavy then don’t be; this was a very light version of the dish. It was flavoured strong enough but without being overpowering after a few bites, and it was perfectly contrasted by the slightly tart pickled vegetables.We shared sides of broccolini with ginger, garlic and chilli and truffle macaroni cheese. If there’s one thing that disappointed food wise it was the broccolini, it was a bit bland and slightly undercooked for my taste. However, the macaroni cheese was out of this world, it was a meal in its own right.After all this we were too full for dessert (portions are extremely generous for a fine dining establishment) so we just had espressos but were brought complementary little chocolates with those. One was a hazelnut sandwich type thing which was amazing, and the other one was nice too, a kind of truffle.My boyfriend had the crab leg starter and the veal chop main and there were no complaints from that side of the table either.AmbienceWell, I’ve been to a LOT of restaurants in my time, and few meet the wow factor of Equinox. The view over the marina is absolutely stunning – we had a window seat and a direct view over to the Marina Bay Sands and the Singapore Flyer – but even without looking out the window one would be amazed. The wooden details are so dramatic and the layout is creative. ServiceCouldn’t fault it. We had a lovely waitress who was very attentive but without being annoying. The wine was topped up when it needed to be and plates were taken away at the right time. The gaps between courses were the perfect length and we didn’t have to wait ages for the bill, which is a pet hate of mine. We initially had a table just nearby the window but not directly in front of it so we thought we’d try our luck and ask to be moved, which we were, for a $20 price, which was definitely worth it.ValueThat brings me to the value, and yes, it’s expensive. I mean, of course it is. If you don’t want to pay a lot of money for a meal then don’t go to places like this. I can’t stand it when people praise a meal and then criticise it for being pricey.As mentioned earlier, my starter was one of the cheaper ones and that was $20, but there are other starters for $36. My main was $75 and my boyfriend’s was $80. The wine was $193, but we paid a premium to get one of our favourites. I think the cheapest wine was $68, which is reasonable.You get what you pay for, and you’re not just paying for the excellent food, you’re paying for the jaw dropping setting and the impeccable service. It all comes at a price but it is worth every penny

I have dined here several times for the semi-buffet lunch as the view is fantastic and the food is excellent. I thoroughly enjoy the fresh Sri Lankan crabs, mushroom salads, cheeses, ice creams as well as the main course salmon. The service is always warm and polite
4
Service staff were friendly and food was good. Only gripe was the pretty long wait time before being seated at the table.
5
Great place to unwind and that too at the 70th floor. Food, ambiance and gentry is great. Had a great time on a Saturday night. Must visit.

The Equipnox is located at the top (70th floor) of the Swissotel Stamford. It faces Marina Bay and the CBD and has a fantastic view. The food is pretty good but the main thing here is the view.
5
The location itself makes you feel very privileged, being 70 stories high above the city, with the great views and unexpected sights of Singapore. All the staff were friendly, helpful, and efficient.But apart from that, every food item seemed especially chosen to make you feel... rich. It's just a semi-buffet, and I think that added to the appeal. It's actually possible to try every item on the menu, and still feel well afterwards.Absolutely try their foie gras. It's one of the most awesome things I've ever put in my mouth

This restaurant provides stunning view of mbs and the marina bay.Upon reaching the restaurant, there's no one at the entrance and we had to wait a while before the hostess arrive to attend to us. I reserved a window table but unfortunately upon arrival the waitress informed that all window table was taken up. Fortunately shortly after a couple left and the manager arranged for us to be sited n waived the window charges of $20.Overall, it's a nice ambience restaurant with romantic feel. Pay with Amex platinum card and u get 50% discount on food.

Equinox is on the spread over the 69th to the 72nd floors of the Swissotel The Stamford. We were there on the 29th Dec for a discreet birthday dinner. The view is to die for, with the lights set up around the bay spread across the Esplanade, Marina Bay Sands to Boat Quay, it was quiet a spectacle. The service was immaculate, the appetisers were all about flavours, the waiters and staff were dressed impeccably, all in making it a wonderful classy experience. Just stay away from the venison roast on the main course, you'll be fine. It was pricey, but we had the Amex 50% off all item promotion, which was honoured with no fuss at all, making it all worthwhile. There's no hurry, just take you time to enjoy the view. ( oh, there was a S$20 surcharge for the table by the window). Impressed that there is an express lift to take you from the G floor straight up to the 70th floor. Highly recommended for that once a year special dinner
5
Even though it was a grey and rainny day, it was worth every penny as the views of Marina Bay and the city are great! We didn´t have a booking but didn´t have any issue in getting a great spot by the window.The service was very good and they were kind enough to accomodate my colleague´s kosher food requests. We enjoyed few starters and a nice sushi platter for two. The price is what you could expect in restaurant that is located on the 70th floor with premium views of the city. However, if you stay at the Swisshotel you will have between 10 and 20% discount (can´t remember the exact %). I would recommend to go for lunch as the views are nicer but I am sure that at night it´s equally pretty. They do afternoon tea (it looked great!) which could be a nice option if you want to see the sunset (winter months) while eating

When you come to Equinox, you pay for the view. And you will pay a lot. But then again the views are absolutely and without doubt the best in Singapore. It does not get any more stunning. You can pretty much see all the parts of the city that are of interest. To maximize the experience, get a 6:30 reservation and get there at 6:15 so you take advantage of the light before it get's dark. For the first 45 minutes just take photos, they are used to it. With regards to the food, the seafood platter for two is pricey but was excellent, the scallops and the steak were superb, but we did have one dish (leek soup) that had a weird taste. The Bellini ended up being champagne with Elderflower liquor rather than peaches but since it was delicious we did not say anything - for the level at which they want to operate though that should not happen. So while there is a bit of upside potential on the food, service was outstanding though and the views are simply unmatched, not just for Singapore
3
The food was ok... Nothing like a Michelin star level .. Yet at a michelin star price.. The wine and cocktails were average.. However the view was something... The sunset and night view were something special.. The service was great and nothing that I can fault .. It was a good experience but just a bit pricey for the standard..
4
About a year ago we had lunch at Equinox, then the view was fantastic because the smoke from Indonesia was minimal.A couple on days ago the smoke was more prominent but not as bad as it could be.The buffet lunch was as good as ever
4
Fantastic sky view, Sunset, excellent food, polite staffs. Fresh food and ingredient used with detailed explanations
4
I was here for a weekday lunch buffet. The view was nice and food was good, overall a great experience.
5
Service is prompt, staff were very attentive. Menu selection can be more extensive. Affordable price range. Will be back :)
5
The experience was Enjoyable, There was a Good View from the restaurant, service crew offered very good Service and my parents really like the visit.
4
The food was really good, however the waiters were really far from average. They need a refresh course how to wait. I.e. On a table the Ladies are always served before the gentlemen. We told them several times but never learned.
Great view.

Perched on the 70th floor, at the top of Swissotel The Stamford hotel, the restaurant offers a panoramic view of the city skyline.The tables and seating areas allocated to diners are generous and spacious, which are perfect for those going on a romantic date or for some business dinner with your fellow associates.Food-wise is excellent. If you are a FAR Card member, you will get some significant discounts on the food and adjoining bar. Service from the floor staffs are excellent, whom are very attentive and a few, rather humorous.The only downside, on a personal note, is that you have to pay an additional for a window side table. The view in general is great. So I recommend saving that for an additional round of scotch.Lighting is rather dim, which might be more for the reason of creating a relax and romantic ambience. Leave your mobile phones / iPads / tablets aside, unless you adjusting and staring at your ultra bright screen(s). The whole of being there is to enjoy the view. Unfortunately, due to the glass and reflections from the interior lightings, photo taking of the city view will generally result in some glare and unwanted reflections in your photos. Prepare to shift around to find the sweet spot for a photoshot.Do reserve early, as the place gets truly packed on Friday TGIFs. Dress is smart casual, which is typical of all such fine dining restaurants.It is generally a pricey menu, so do bring your credit card. Alternatively, just skip appetizers and go straight to entrÃ©es and desserts. Or drinks

We had a great time at Equinox restaurant. The buffet spread is good.We love the seafood especially the cold crabs,prawns and the fresh oysters. There are also some good Japanese fares if you are a fan of Japanese food. The soups are of acceptable standard but can be further improved. Food besides, the views from the restaurant are really breathtaking. It is worth a visit even if you are short of time and cannot afford enough time to savour the entire buffet.
3
the views were amazing, but for us, the lighting was way too dark, the service extremely slow, and the food was only ok. the pork dish was tough, the chicken was ok, but not worth the $$$$$ that we paid. There are much better restaurants in Singapore. We waited so long for the dessert menu that we had to get up and ask for it. the poor waitress was run off her feet. after an initial greeting the manager of the restaurant was invisible, until we complained at the end of the evenin

My husband and I dined here as a special meal to celebrate our honeymoon. The views from throughout this restaurant are spectacular and the service is faultless. We were pleased to see vegetarian options on the menu and once we received these meals were blown away with the flavour. This was one of our most memorable honeymoon experiences and we are so very thankful. We even recieved some 'happy honeymoon' chocolates :)
5
Got great view, food and people. Immediately as you enter the restaurant, you will be awed with the great view by looking at how wonderful Singapore is. Plus the mouth watering food that I tasted such as duck (which I don't fancy at all before) but here, I fell in love with it and even the great dessert with amazing presentation, it's a great feeling. Of course, the wonderful people who served us which let you feel like you are a queen being served. A wonderful experience indeed! :
5
service is superb and waiters are all attentive. Book for window seat if you want full view of Singapore bay area, it's definitely one of the highlights.
The seafood are fresh and delicious.
Though be prepared to spend $200 above for 2 pax

Food, wine, service and location were all superb. I had a vegetarian meal which was exquisite. As a hotel guest I got a priority table and a discount from the bill. Can't beat it.

Equinox has always been my top choice when it comes to oysters - I really love those that they have, compared to the other buffets out there. It was a Sunday brunch and the cost was more than double of the usual weekday rates, so naturally we would expect more. Indeed, there was a wider spread of food available, live band and a roaming magician. If I were to rate, live band was good, food was overall ok, magician is really bad. During my last visit in mid Oct, I was shocked to know that the oysters I tasted had already turned bad. I was pretty embarrassed about it as I was raving to my friend whom I bought this time on how delicious their oysters were. Never did I expect such things to happen. Both of us tasted bad oysters so it can't be wrong. The next thing that made us swear that we are never going to go for their Sunday Brunch was the magician they had. We were lucky (or perhaps unlucky) to have the magician come to our table to perform for us. He did quite a few tricks but amongst the few tricks he failed one and accidentally revealed the double cards he was holding for another. Gosh, never did I expect magicians of such quality at such posh restaurant! To express my unpleasant dining incident, I emailed the management and feedback to them about the oysters and magician. What surprises me was that the reply that came to me defended their oysters and magician. They apologized that their oysters are probably 'not acquired to my taste' and that they had a last minute replacement as their usual magician was not able to turn up. Seriously, there is a difference between oysters that tasted different due to the breeds and oysters that has turned bad. Did you really think I am not able to differentiate? A replacement magician' therefore the lousy performance, what kind of lousy excuse is that? I did not reply the email anymore as I felt that it is redundant and a waste of time to talk to people who only create excuses as an cover-up. I never really like to write bad reviews, but I really do not want people to experience the same terrible experience that I had. All I can say is, it is thoroughly disappointing
5
Perfect place for perfect occasion. Aside from the beautiful and relaxing ambiance,i can say Two thumbs up for the mouth watering dishes they have. Likewise, to all the service crews! Even though its during peak hours they still manage to serve us well. Thanks again to crew: michel and to others for serving us!

Located on the 70th floor of the Swiss Hotel. The views are great but if you ask for a window seat you are charged an extra $20 more for the privilege! The food was nicely displayed but in our opinion lacked flavour. None of our dishes came out warm enough we believe

This is our second visit to this top restaurant, the first, some 6 years ago being absolutely first class. On this latest occasion, a small (3) family grouping, staying at the Swissotel The Stamford for a special celebration decided on this venue for our last night here. Our anticipation was high after our previous experience, and the majority reviews of this restaurant. Unfortunately on this occasion our expectations were not met. This is a simply splendid venue with spectacular views, and these were fulfilled with a lovely window table. The appetizer for me was the leek soup which was pretty average with a deep green liquid in which I really could not detect any leek and the so- called crab fritter tasteless. Worse was to follow. Although my miso-roasted black cod was quite superb, my wife's duck, although advised to be rare, appeared virtually raw, and although she did eat it, with some difficulty, it appeared virtually raw to me and I could certainly not have eaten it. The worst though was my daughter's Iberico pork loin which she was obliged to return uneaten. She was offered an alternative but this was declined, having accepted that the evening was already irreversibly spoilt. She was the object of the special celebration. My wife enjoyed her dessert. The service was also not up to scratch, particularly the almost 5 minutes delay between the serving of the mains, and the arrival of the mashed potatoes! So much for anticipation. This is simply not good enough for a restaurant of this standing and prices. Maybe this was just a bad night, but it was our deliberately chosen celebratory dinner in a famed venue where we had previously had a most enjoyable experience. So be it. Still extremely disappointing. I am usually a most positive contributor, and it distresses me to feel obliged to provide this negative review. +butor, but on this occasion, I found my

Came here with business associates. A window table cost an extra S$20. We ordered sea bass, free-range chicken, leek soup, cream of mushroom and fries. For 2 the bill came to S$ 290. It was worth the evening. Book online or call in advance to secure a table. Enjoy a breather at the cigar room before leaving. Highly recommended
4
Service was good, servers were pretty attentive. Though food was mediocre, not much to rave about, the usual stuff. Truffle sandwich was kind of dry. View from the top was the highlight! We had a table by the window which made us felt therapeutic. Thumb up for the privacy. Cosy and intimate time with the lovely family. Definitely worth every penny. Looking forward to the next..
5
I cannot stress quite how fantastic this restaurant is, and I would definitely say it is an absolute must when visiting Singapore. Go in the evening in particular, and the views and simply incredible, with beautiful views of Marina Bay Sands and the CBD; while slightly out of the majority of high rises in Singapore city, this means that you're able to see absolutely everything. It's stunning.But actually this is secondary to the staff and the food in Equinox, which is genuinely some of the best food I have ever eaten. While they may seem like small portions, they never fail to fill you up, and they are simply divine. After having been several times and taken my parents and boyfriend, there has never been anything which has been simply 'ok'. The food is fantastic and I can't say anything else. It is the staff however which make Equinox. They are lovely; some of the kindest and most helpful people. My last visit (22/10/2015) was my birthday, and despite not specifically telling them this, they over heard my guests wish me happy birthday in conversation, and presently brought out a cake and sang happy birthday to me; all without being asked. It was so surprising, and a genuinely thoughtful gesture on their part which made my evening. I love going to Equinox, and I would recommend it to everyone
5
I was in Singapore for work staying at the swissotel so dined at equinox for dinner. I had the wagyu tataki and misu black cod ... wow. They were divine. One of those meals you savour every bite... it's been a long time since I've had that feeling of outstandingly balanced flavors. Highly recommen
5
Perfect brunch ever! There is a wide selection of gastronomic foods and wines beers and champagne for a perfect pairing. The view is amazing, the ambiance is perfect. The attendants...super friendly. The price is reasonable.
I highly recommend this restaurant.
4
View up on the 70th floor is awesome. The service staff were attentive and excellent. Food is good but not great. The tenderloin is nicely grilled and tender. The soup a tad too watery and the sides were pretty normal. Wine list is extensive.
5
Great experience with Equinox! They have an amazing view in dining and the service was simply amazing!
5
Food was great, though a little bit over priced. Atmosphere was cozy enough for dinner. View was breathtaking.
5
Fantastic view even though a little bit too hazy, great service with very pleasant staff and complimentary birthday cake, very good food, can recommend the chateaubriand for two people! Definately worth a visit if celebrating a special occasion!
5
Went there on a weekday evening. Excellent views of Marana Bay and Padang area with good service. However, there could be more selection in the dinner menu.
5
We had the bar recommended to us for the grand view and so we headed up before dinner and had a couple of cocktails looking out over the city as it transitioned from day to night. It was a spectacular spot to spend an hour!
5
Whilst we had heard mixed reviews about Equinox, our visit was simply perfect and top marks go to the whole team.This was my wife's first visit to Singapore and she needs to follow a gluten free diet. This was not a problem at the hotel as a number of menu options were gluten free and they also provided gluten free bread before the meal. We enjoyed a 3 course meal with 2 bottles of wine and coffee. It was excellent - from the service, presentation to the quality of the food. The views were also AMAZING as the Singapore smog had subsided a little so the evening skyline was visible and impressive. We love Singapore and if you are looking for somewhere to eat that will also impress, this has got to be on your list if not your preferred choice.A truly enjoyable experience and we will be back
5
The view was 10/10, even though there was the haze.The food was 7/10. Appetisers were very good, mains were so-so. The complimentary slice of cake for my girlfriend's birthday was a nice touch.The staff's service (Flora) was 10/10. Super attentive and nice to speak to. Full marks for her.Thanks for a great time!
2
Disappointed. Hmm... Oyster is not fresh...obviously it's been in the fridge for a while, then we replaced another dish - prawn instead of Oyster. Well, the prawn is fresh yet the temperature is ok; main course we'd beef tenderloin - again, disappointed. We ordered 'medium-rare' end up we have 'medium' - nearly 'well done' - well, they replaced us 'medium-rare' eventually ...from starter to dessert - all disappointed. If this is considered a fine-dining restaurant, I should rank in low and definitely not visiting again. Service is fair. We had 2 starters, 2 main course and 1 dessert. 1 Glass of champagne, 2 Glasses of Red Wine from Australia ...total cost at SGD400
5
The restaurant provided me with top-notch service and they fulfilled my request way better than I have expected it to be!
4
Great views, great ambience and good food. The seafood is so fresh, must try. Oh, and the desserts are to LIVE for!
5
Located at the 70th floor of Swissotel The Stamford, Singapore.
Great food with a great view.
The place is very cozy overlooking the view of Singapore at night. Totally an awesome sight to see.

Equinox is a nice restaurant to catch a good view of Singapore. We went on a weekday for lunch and they served semi buffet - which is ala carte for the main course accompanied with a good buffet spread of seafood, sashimi, cheese and dessert. Must try from the ala carte - their steak! Tender and succulent. Service is good. Cons - price a bit steep and the air con did not seem to function properly when we were there; perhaps it was a warm afternoon
5
I had dinner alone; my table was arranged by the hotel that I had stayed. I had a great table for which I had to pay a premium of 20 S $. No issues with that. The views of the Marina Bay area was really stunning. The staff was extremely nice, especially as my hotel concierge had flagged me. The female staff member from the Philippines was very caring and attentive. I had a venison which was like a mini portion at premium price. The taste wasn't as expected. The views and the service compensated for the disappointment with the exorbitant prices. I fully understand that you pay for the views but an high prices and a premium for the window table is a bit greedy, in my opinion.
5
The service is top-class which is exactly what you expect with the 5-star location. It sits atop a 70th floor of the Swissotel with grand sweeping views of Marina Bays Sands, The Floating Platform & the Esplanade.This is a premium place so expect to pay for a window seat. The food is relatively priced for the premium food.I would recommend for business meetings & couples with special days to celebrate. Would return but only for special occasions
4
The overall experience was excellent. To start with the restaurant had a great view and they charge you for the tables which have a nicer view of the Singapore Skyline. The view was a bit of a drag as the Haze was playing spoilsport.The Starters came on time and the food was brilliant, I must comment that the Steak I had ordered was outstanding and perfectly cooked
4
We have eaten here before & decided to take my husbands parents for their wedding anniversary. We utilised my husbands 25% discount via Amex.After checking in downstairs & taking the lift up, we were treated with the great view. We decided not to pay the extra S$20 for a window seat and were given a table toward the back, at the far end of the restaurant. We were under the ac & I wished I'd taken a jacket/cardigan as after a while I felt a little cold.My husband ordered a mineral water but if you prefer they will bring a jug of water too (which the rest of us had along with our wine). We each had starters which were all good. The steaks the men had for mains were good and the pork main was delicious - even the grits that accompany it! You must save space for dessert: they are so good.We had good service, the courses were delivered at a leisurely pace which gives time for taking in the views. We saw the marina bay laser show & took a few photos. The restaurant was filling up but remained calming & fairly quiet. We saw a few children but I dudnt see any very young children & I didn't spot any high chairs although they may have been there.I'd recommend the restaurant although without the discount I'm not sure I'd think it was great value for money. The food was lovely, but it is also expensive. Haven said that, I'm sure we'll be back
5
Incredible views over Singapore, you can see it all! In fact friends were drinking on the Fullerton rooftop bar below, which seemed like miles away from what must be the highest restaurant! Had the seafood platter as a starter and then I carried on eating it for my main as my husband had a steak. Almost finished-totally full and still had a whole lobster to eat! Love this restaurant, good goid and super value wines. Afterwards went into New Asia bar with awesome music, the DJ is great and had a lovely Merlion Cocktail (in a Merlion cup!) I love the black miso cod too which I'll have next time! Extra charge for window seat is totally worth it!!!!!!
5
We've on holiday now but have been visiting this restaurant since the early 90s. Food choice wasn't as wide as you might find in other hotel buffets but the quality was excellent and we coped without pasta/pizza. The staff were also very good, champagne glass hardly ever seemed to be empty, and of course the view was spectacular and needless to say has grown since our last visit a couple of years ago. Not cheap, but worth it
5
1st time here. Great service by the team, attentive and made effort to check for dietary requirements during food ordering. Very pleasant afternoon spend. Great view!
4
The property is on level 70, stunning views. Excellent menu, great wine list.
Food could not be faulted, superb recommendation in the wines, no leadership on service. Pleasant but confused.
4
I've recently visited Equinox restaurant and was impressed with the food and service. We got a table with the view to die for, facing the Indonesian islands and of course, the Marina Bay Sands! We were there early evening so we saw the whole transition from day to night, and it was simply amazing! My boyfriend and I were especially impressed with the Seabass wrapped with a special bark of tree, it tastes so delish and so delicate. The beef was really well done as well! All in all, a good place to dine in with an amazing view..
5
I have tried other Sunday brunches in Singapore but this is a stand-out. The view alone from the 70th floor is awesome, they could almost get away serving party pies and sausage rolls with that view....but the food is well beyond that! We asked for and got a window seat, the free flow Moet started and continued responsibly through the next 3 hours. There is a wonderful selection of foods, seafood (fish, mollusc, crustacean, caviar), salads, roast meats and veg - all tasty. Good selection of desserts and wonderful coffee. Staff attentiveness and friendliness added to the experience. Not cheap, but you aren't drinking soda and eating party pies! Definitely worth a try for a special event or to simply indulge
5
My husband took me there last Sat night on our way home to Australia, after 3 weeks holiday! I have to say everything about it was exceptional. The service, the quality of the food and of course the view. We were lucky enough to be there the weekend of their celebrations of 50 years of Independence so we even had fireworks on the bay, as well as rehearsals for the following evening. We ordered the seafood platter to share, wonderful!
5
Semi buffet lunch with good varieties of appetizers and dessert! Main course you can choose one dish per person from the menu! Pork belly was out of my expectation! It was very yummy! Reasonable price for semi buffet lunch as well! Service was a bit slow in the beginning maybe the lunch hour just started but afterward we got a better service!Will definitely come back again
3
A beautiful room and view there is no denying. An excellent menu and well constructed wine list for sure. Food pretty good but probably should have been better for the price. service was the issue here - requests forgotten, frustrating requests to sub-waiters who only pick up plates and cant help, steak not cooked as ordered. These small things mount up when in such a superb venue with high prices. Hopefully it was just a bad night ..

For full review and photos, please visit: http://summerlovestoeat.blogspot.sg/2015/07/semi-lunch-buffet-at-equinox-swissotel.htmlEverything has improved tremendously in terms of service and food quality compared to my last visit in late 2013. The staff will all smile and greet you politely when you enter the restaurant and there will be a staff to standby at each section to serve you. If you prefer to have main course first, do let the server know that you want to be serve main course first. Otherwise they will only prepare after you finish the appetizers from the buffet spread.The dessert buffet used to be nice to look at but cannot make it. But now, all desserts tasted great! Main Course were high quality too! We were very satisfied with everything here except the window seats were all quite warm during daytime, I do not like the blinds to be pull down as we came here because of the great view, otherwise it's perfect! Note: No extra charge for window seats during lunch time but there will be an additional charge of $20 during dinner time if you want window seat
4
Very limited choice for vegetarians measuring to 2 to 4 including the appetizers, thus vegetarians can mainly enjoy the place for its location, ambiance and service is ok. Getting a window table asks for an additional surcharge but being there mainly for its view one should opt for itThe presentation of the food on the platter is lovely and inviting. All in all an also place
5
We visited this restaurant 26 years ago before we were married and one week after HM Queen Elizabeth had visited and sat at our table We returned last night and had a fabulous meal. Great views fantastic service from really lovely people and superb food. Thanks for keeping our memories so precious
3
Food is not the best part, choice is very limited and super overpriced. View is great, customer service is great. About 180/190 sgd per pax
5
Arrive early as chair near the windows are limited. There is a surcharge for sitting by the window however it is taken off the bill if you spend over a certain amount ($75 Singapore ). Which is not hard to do as the prices are very 5 star hotel. Evenings it is dressy so no shorts & tank tops.Food lots to choose from. Finger food & meals
5
One of the best views in Singapore if you get a window table, otherwise hold off until you do. Food and service superb. Wine is the normal jaw dropping Singapore price. Unfortunately two large groups were in the restaurant which had a detrimental effect on the refined atmosphere
4
A good lunch. However, despite all the stipulations about dress code and all that, I see guys wearing shorts and collarless and sleeveless t-shirt and women talking as though they own the whole place. A restaurant of this high status should endeavour to maintain its ambience and class!
5
We went for High Tea on Sunday afternoon. The session is only open from 4 - 5 pm which was perfect timing for two twenties. The view is amazing on th 70th floor. We had the afternoon tea for 4 which was $90 ++. We were unable to finish as we were too full. The staff and service were excellent
1
Had a really upsetting experience. Was planning to celebrate my birthday by watching the NDP fireworks from the restaurant. Boyfriend made a reservation and specifically asked for a window seat. He also agreed to the extra charges. When the staff called him to confirm his reservation, he reminded the staff of the same request. Yet, when we arrived this evening, we were arranged a seat far away from the window. This was really disappointing since we made the reservation several months ago. We would not have made a reservation if not for the view. The restaurant should have been more honest if they could not accede to this request so we could have made other plans. Thanks for ruining the evening, Equinox
5
The view over Singapore from this restaurant is amazing. The wine list is nothing short of phenomenal. The dishes were beautifully presented, the food of the best quality.The staff were knowledgeable about the menu choices, attentive and courteous.Hard to fault in anyway at all but the prices are not for the faint hearted
5
We went here on the second night of our honeymoon on a three day stop over in Singapore. I chose this place off the back of reviews on this site and wasn't disappointed at all! One minor hitch was the fact that I was in shorts (being British and in ridiculous heat it's all I wore my whole time in Singapore! Lol), and the dress code is closed shoes and trousers. Luckily for me I was staying at the Fairmont hotel 5mins away so went to get changed!The view from the 70th floor is amazing, overlooking the bay and the City it is stunning to view and a lovely sight to have whilst eating! The food is not cheap but quite reasonable when considering how delicious it was, how wonderful the service provided was and that view! We had a steak each and a half bottle of Rioja for around 275 Singapore dollars.Nice little touch also whilst my wife was waiting for me to go and change into trousers she got talking to the staff and told them we were on our honeymoon. After our main dinner, we were presented with a nice desert with congratulations written in chocolate sauce. A lovely thoughtful touch. Would definitely recommend going at night when the bay and singapore is beautifully illuminated with the city lights. You can see from the observation wheel (flyer) all the way to the city
3
I'm going to be very fair in this review. The service in this restaurant I cannot fault, but too be honest the prices for the food and especially wine was beyond my compression. My wife and I have dined in five star and some cities best restaurants around the world and have been very satisfied with our evenings. I left the restaurant feeling a little disappointed. My wife's duck was such a tiny piece of meat for $58 and what came with it was not a lot. I had bass the fillet was a good size but again $$$$. With our meal it's nice to have a bottle of wine but I was not going to pay $170 in that facinity, for an Australian wine, so two glasses it was at $28 ea.You are definitely paying for the view on the 70th floor, so needless to say we skip having sweets.To be honest that day was in little India and should have gone there for dinner had the best curry it was awesome, the flavours were outstanding. Next time in Singapore it's back to little India for every dinner.Sorry equinox it was nice but not good enough.

They serve a semi-buffet during lunch and it's a great deal. You get to choose a main course and enjoy all the soups, appetizers and desserts in buffet style. The fish mains are generally well done. For the buffet, the seafood portion is especially good with different varieties of oysters, crabs, prawns, etc. I love the soup too!Of course, the unblocked view is awesome! You get to see the whole marina area, Raffles Place and a large part of western Singapore

Every time we visit Singapore we dine at Equinox. The view is amazing, the food is devine and the service impeccable. Definitely on the higher end of costing though. Highly recommend this restaurant.

Location: on top of the tallest building (or at least so they say) in Singapore. Breathtaking view of the downtown and the Marina Bay area. Gigabytes andd gygabytes of pics taken before, during and after dinner. The

Booked for a special dinner the view was fantastic but $20 for a window seat which wasn't a window seat wine as usual for Singapore overpriced because of tax food nice but nothing special no deserts $500 nice night but not worth the money

My wife and I wanted a place to celebrate our wedding anniversary while we had a stop over in Singapore on our way home from Italy.We chose Equinox because of its position on the 70th floor off the Swiss Hotel complex for the views.It was difficult to get a booking either by ringing or via their internet booking system, obviously it is a popular place and Saturday nights it's even more in demand.We did however get a booking using the concierge of our hotel the Fairmont which is a sister hotel to the Swiss Hotel The views from Equinox are spectacular just sensational and what made it extra special were the fire works that are part of Singapore practising for its 50th anniversary celebrations, yes they actually practice The food is extremely good, small portions on big plates but the presentation and flavours are first class.Try the poached rhubarb desert you will be presently surprised by how it is presented You have to pay for the views and exclusivity of this restaurant circa $400-$500 for a couple and that was drinking their lowest price wineIf you want to splash out a little more they offer Chateaux Lafitte 1961 for $17000 a bottl

Went after a while to Equinox for a Sunday evening dinner with friends, and was once again deeply impressed with the fantastic, almost 180-degree views of the 'lion city' which this restaurant on the 71st floor offers. It is still (at least for me) a "million dollar view" - especially if you do come early at 6:30 in the evening, and can see the transition from day to night time panorama. The ambience of the restaurant is classy without being snobbish, and the service is always very welcoming and attentive. We followed recommendations for the appetizer and enjoyed the cauliflower soup as well as the leek soup a lot. Especially the leek soup is a beautiful dish to look at - and tastes great, too. For the mains we had pork loin, sea bass and beef - and we were not disappointed with the quality of the dishes. Along with a very fitting recommendation for a nice bottle of red wine to go along with our main course, we thoroughly enjoyed our meal. We also were impressed by the high service standards throughout the mail since the attention given by the very professional service staff was outstanding. Granted though, the restaurant was not fully booked - and we therefore might have gotten a bit of "extra attention" along with the other guest present. The evening was topped off with a great desert (special cake order), and we felt that for the value and first class experience (plus the unbeatable view) the Equinox delivers on all levels - and certainly met our high expectations. The only small suggestion for improvement: please, Equinox team make sure that your phone lines are staffed sufficiently since I did have the hardest time calling in for a reservation (after not being able to reach a customer service assistant after several calls, I made an online booking instead, and that worked perfectly fine and superfast). But this did not take anything away from our wonderful dinner experience: Equinox is highly recommended, and I will surely be back

Tried the buffet lunch today as a prelude to my stay-cation. The seafood selection is impressive. I especially like the salmon roe and caviar. My wife loved the freshness of the oysters. However, some of the crab was overdone and the flesh was tough and dry. The hot food was disappointing though. The beef was tasteless and tough and the chicken looked a bit raw. I took a bite and had it taken away.The service left much to be desired. Our server didn't have the initiative to take plates away and would only clear them when (and if) we managed to get her attention. I would have been really unhappy if I had had to pay the full price for the food. But after applying my discount card and voucher to it, I guess I can't complain.The Earl Grey flavored cake was excellent though.

Its on the 71st floor of the Swisshotel which until recently was the highest restaurant in the tallest hotel in the World. The views of the city are staggering, day and night, and one can see for miles.Service was excellent, as was the food - international cuisine at its best as one would expect from a restaurant with Equinox's reputation. It is expensive, yes, but no worse than any other top class restaurant in a major city.Try to get a window seat - we failed but we booked very late. Its not a problem - you can still see the super vista.Don't miss this place if you visit Singapore, especially if you are staying in the sister hotels Fairmont or Swisshotel, where the tower is located.

Still very good and view amazing. I did not think the buffet was as good as on previous visits. Very impressed that as I was dining with some friends ( and was paying) that waiter told me that if I paid with MasterCard I could get 20% discount. ( I had planned to pay in cash).

We recently celebrated a combined birthday for 7 school friends.It was a trip of a life time.We selected Equinox as our preferred restaurant.The arrangements were made via internet before our arrival.The staff were very efficient and helpful.We arrived on the night to splendid table with views to die for.Our meals were all delicious and the service was second to none.Thank you to Casper and all the staff for making the night a truly memorable one.It has undoubtably the best night view in Singapore

Private room on 69 floor with 180 degree views over Singapore. Unfortunately clouds rolled in together with a lightning storm, the storm was good to watch.Food was excellent and served well.Room was large enough to stand and mingle before being seated at large tables ( we were part of a conference party).Toilet was down a set of stairs so not ideal if you were unable to manage the couple of flights
5
Nothing more than what we can ask for. Fine dishes done in most sophisticated skills, helpful in choosing wine and we get a window seat. But because the window seat was right at the far end, we sometimes have problem getting attention when our main course was taking more than half hour to arrive
5
My husband and I have eaten in this restaurant twice and we will keep on coming back. I made a reservation by calling the Equinox Complex Customer Service number. If you want to get the window seats with a good view of the city and harbour, you need to book several weeks ahead. On these 2 occasions, we had semi-buffet lunch. We had one main course each and an unlimited buffet of sea food, desserts, etc (see pictures). As an American Express card holder, I get 50% off for meals and I believe 15% off the drinks (for 2 people). Totally worth it as long as you have the 50% off card.The semi-buffet lunch starts at 12 noon and ends at 2:30pm. You need to leave the area by then as they need to prepare for afternoon tea
5
this restaurant is on the 70th floor of the Swisshotel with panoramic views over the esplanade to Marina bay. Totally amazing. For those on a budget this is perhaps not for you but if you are prepared to squeeze the wallet then it is worth every penny. The quality of the food is first class. we had the Sea food platter which tasted delicious. A bottle of Pinot (wine is not cheap in Singapore) went very well with this.The waiters were faultless, impeccable manners and unobtrusive. A sheer dining pleasure and we will return

This over-the-top restaurant located on the 70th floor features charming Asian elements like rice paper lanterns, suspended Ming wooden trellises and a luminous mother-of-pearl wall. Complementing its breathtaking view of the city and surrounding isles of Malaysia and Indonesia .It’s near impossible not to be impressed at this awe-inspiring setup all the way up at Swissotel the Stamford. Equinox Restaurant’s, that’s quite an experience on its own. Being on the 70th floor that will take your breath away—be sure to ask for a prime window seat so you can take it all in. this is sky-high dining destination, and most importantly the food of good quality and of the freshest ingredients. Amazing

It was a celebration for Mothers' Day, and I had chosen Equinox for High Tea with my mother of 33 years and my sister being a first-time mom. The reservation came at a surprise for me, we were offered a window seat, where usually it comes with an additional cost. The stunning skyline of Singapore welcomed us when we first stepped into the restaurant. It was breath-taking and certainly took off a few megabytes of the phone camera memory. We were politely ushered to our seats and there we started our snapping off the camera. The staff was also courteous enough to help us with our group picture, and promptly took our order. The high tea set comes with the savouries and the sweets, which we thought was just nice for tea time. The scones with jam and clotted cream was extremely delish, and all other snacks were just right for our taste buds. Our tea was kept warm and filled throughout our time there. We polished all snacks and went back with rubbing tummies. The service was great and the ambience was really comfortable, nothing noisy and loud, and of course the view was really picturesque.Totally worth every cents to sent my loved ones to enjoy this little bonding session. Thank you to the team at Equinox

We took our family from out-of-town to celebrate a birthday occasion. They were thoroughly impressed by the venue, the views and the ambience. However, the service was not up to standard in my opinion. Water and wines were not poured timely. We often had to look around for our waiter to ask for something. The food was good but not five stars. We ordered the ribeye steak for two with truffled butter and scallops and black cod. Overall the food is standard and unimaginative. At this price range I expected more and would probably opt to try others before returning again.
4
Love the view from the restaurant and most importantly the food here are superb! Had the steak with truffle sauce and it was amazing, however i expected far more presentable food - nevertheless food was definitely food, despite being semi-buffet, the food are of good quality and of the freshest ingredients. amazing

The sceneI love taking photos and told my friend that I wanted the best view of Singapore, so he booked us dinner for 2 here at The Equinox restaurant. This is a very classy place and the ambiance is just perfect – dim lights with candles on each table. It was also beautifully decorated and well-ventilated. The place is very cozy and comfortable too. The serviceWhen we arrived at the venue, we waited for the receptionist for about 4 minutes because she was entertaining some guests to their seats before us. My friend booked us window seats because that’s ultimately the best view ever! Oh, that’s an additional S$20 too! Service was pretty good. The waitress was attentive and would frequently ask us if we still need anything. The servers would give us bread rolls while we waited for our meals. ( we were so FULL after the second meal ;D ) The foodFood was really great! I love everything about it! I could still remember telling my friend, “OMG, this is so good.” , “This is so delicious!” or “ The Black Truffle Butter is the best!!!” Here’s what we ordered:Appetizer: Wagyu Tataki, Bonito Braised-Turnips, Grilled Leeks, Truffle Ponzu Scallop Main Course: Sea Bass, Cooked in Paper Bark, Saltbush Gremolata, Baby VegetablesSeared Scallop, Mussel and Broad Beans Minestrone, Calamari, Chervil OilFrom The Grill: Creekstone, Grain Fed Prime Angus, U.S.D.A 28 Day Aged - 225g TenderloinThe Sauce: Black Truffle Butter (THIS IS THE BEST. I highly recommend you try this) The Side: Steamed Broccolini with French Fries, Ginger, Garlic, ChilliDrinks: Sprite and Earl Grey tea Do the math: Additional charges – Miscellaneous + 10% Service Charge + 7% GST The price Very expensive but so worth it! Go give it a try! *wink* The dress codeRemember it’s a classy restaurant, so please wear semi-formal attire. Overall rating: I give this restaurant a 10/10! Given the chance, I would definitely go back here! This place has the best view of Singapore especially at night! You would see The Singapore Flyer, Marina Bay Sands, The Esplanade, etc in all their glory! Hahaha. Of course, don’t forget to bring your trusty camera and take lots of great photos! Nothing but great memories! :) I can’t thank my friend enough for bringing me here! He made one of my dreams come true!

I called this restaurant to make a reservation for 2 pax, and told the staff that I am going to surprise my husband as it's his birthday and I also ask if what they could offer for the birthday celebrant, and she said they can prepare a small piece of cake with a candle on it and they will sing as well, so I am very happy with this. When I requested to have a table on the window side so we can enjoy the view of the city, I get told that I need to pay an extra 20sgd for the view, so of course I have to say it's ok since it's a celebration anyway.Upon arriving at this place the hostess greeted us and brought us to our table, she is very polite and friendly.We ordered different things,y husband ordered fish dish while I order steak. It's very delicious! The red wine is good too so we both enjoyed it! When we are almost done our meal the staff came with the cake and sing happy birthday, and surprisingly all the people from nearby tables stop eating and sing happy birthday as well, so it's unforgettable experience for him. Thank you to all the staff here who help me with this surprise. My husband loves it! He enjoyed the dinner , the view and the experience. Worth coming back!

This is well worth a visit, the views are spectacular , 70 floors up overlooking Singapore and the fact that the food was amazing was a plus too. The service was great we had a great waitress too. The food was absolutely superb and they even brought a cake at the end to say welcome to Singapore
5
Great way to start a Sunday. Brunch at the equinox is worth it especially with the view of the singapore skyline. Service was also great during the meal
5
My family and I had a lunch buffet here. Food is good and with an affordable price we can have a wonderful scenic view along Singapore river and Marina Bay Area.

The food, view and service are great, the price is reasonable. I will come back very sooonnn for sure! ^^

We went for the Pink Brunch, which was held every last Sunday of the month. Simply the best dining experience I've had so far. Great view of the city from the restaurant. Variety and quality of the dishes are top notch. Loved the oysters, very fresh. Unlimited servings of rosette wine and pink champagne.Other than the food, there were also entertainment. There was a balloon sculptor and magician going from table to table providing laughs, on top of the delicious food.Highly recommended for special occasions such as anniversaries. Pricey, but memorable brunch
5
Amazing view from very high over the Marina Bay. There is a buffet lunch (includes a prepared main) which is extensive and of high quality. Especially good selection of fresh seafood and also a great choice for the cheese lover !!. Good value at $58++ per head. The main reason fro going though is the view ... when you book make sure you ask for a table by the windo

We had a lunch reservation for 4 at Equinox Restaurant located in Swissotel the Stamford, the tallest hotel in Singapore. Despite us going up to the restaurant about ten minutes after our reservation timing, we were a little disappointed when we were seated at a table which had only 3 settings. Although they immediately prepared the 4th setting and brought the 4th chair, it was definitely not the type of service we were expecting.I must admit though that besides that glitch, the service on the whole was wonderful. We were there on a Saturday afternoon and they had a semi buffet, which meant that you ordered your main course from the menu. This would be served when ready.As usual, at a buffet, we aim for our favourite foods such as salmon sashimi, sushi as well as the cold prawns and oysters. After having gone for a second helping of buffet, we had to remind ourselves that the main course was yet to come.We had the roasted salmon, slow roasted farm house chicken, pan-seared snapper and caramalized pork belly. The chicken was superb... Really nice and tender, followed by the snapper. Found the pork belly slightly saltish though. View was definitely spectacular.. From a height of 70 stories, you get great views of Marina Bay Sands, Singapore Flyer and many other Singapore landmarks.If you are an Amex/FAR member, you can use your vouchers for a 50% discount and also redeem your voucher for a birthday cake.Do remember that there is a dress code. Smart casuals is necessary for lunch

We booked the Sunday champagne Brunch with free flowing champagne as a treat to celebrate an anniversary. With so many other places offering champagne brunch our decision was based on the location, to be more specific the 70th floor.It was Easter Sunday we have visited and it was good. The fresh seafood selection was amazing, the foi gras to die for and yes the Moet Chandon was free flowing. It was not 'just' a great meal with champagne, it certain,y was an experience. We loved the stunning views, service, food and the the feeling of 'special'
5
On a brillant sunny day, you will get an excellent view outside. Internally, beautifully decorated - if you like to do a lot of cover photos, this is the place for it.The food quality is great, choice is excellent and the service is remarkable.The only set back, you must be able to climb a bit of stairs. I am not sure if they have facilities for handicapped, best to call and check cos i dont need it yet, so i didnt notice =

I went with my family to celebrate my birthday. We went there because it has a great view AND for two years I've been paying a "VIP" membership (which is quite expensive) for the Restaurant.With the VIP membership we were supposed to get a 25% discount on our bill.My wife gave the membership card to the waitress and a few minutes later she came back saying she could not give the vip discount because the card was expired.What we realized is that we have not exchanged in our wallet the membership card when the new came in, but we explained that they could check that our membership was current.A manager came and told us he couldn't give the discount because we didn't bring the updated plastic. Again we told them we thought it was absurd, since this was a restaurant card and they could easily check records or take my word (i work a few blocks away). We said it was infair we would be punished for an innocent mistake.Again he said no. What cemented my impression in the place is when said to us "next time you better check all the rules and regulations in the contract before you sign". I said to myself: "game over, lets go."Not only will the retaurant lose an annual very expensive membership, but of course i have no plans to ever returning there.Just as you asked me to read in full my "contract", i hope you read this new article in this new contract i am signing: "not again, no thanks

Was there with my family on 23.3.15 for their semi lunch buffet. We were using the AMEX/Far card and my husband and I both have one each. To be entitled to more discount, we usually get two tables but seated side by side. We have done it with this card with many other prestigious hotel restaurants. However, I was appalled yesterday when I was told by the manager that it is a POLICY that by using 2 cards, we cannot be seated next to each other, but to be far away! He said ' if you want to sit side by side, u have to use one card, (meaning only 20% discount for the 4 of us) but if u want to use 2 cards (50% discount) you have to be seated far away!) What kind of policy is that? Because we pay less, we get penalized by separating our dining company? The restaurant was so empty yesterday and he finally seated us in two tables far away from each other, literally one end to the other! I was seated at a place, where the next table to me was vacant!!I will never go there again thanks to the lousy service given by the manager name Des

Equinox is one of the best romantic fine dining restaurants in Singapore. Situated at 70th floor in Swissotel the Stamford hotel.Went with my family here twice. We both experienced great service on both visit. We really want to sit near the window to enjoy the view and the ambience more in our first visit. However, the window area are fully booked and was given a table farther from the window. Still, the environment of Equinox was sensational.We called for reservation in our second visit and was luckily given the window sit. The view was astonishing. The city lights of Singapore enhances our mood to stay longer at Equinox. Our table was facing the financial district of Singapore that has fabulous skyscrapers. We even witnessed the Marina Bay Sands' dancing lights. MBS dancing lights starts around 9:00pm every day.Staffs are well-prepared and enthusiastic. They are happily serving us throughout the dinner. They are very attentive in our needs. They are well sociable and delivered great service.Equinox serves delectable food. My favorite was the cod fish and lobster bisque. They serves mouthwatering desserts too. I ordered Creme brûlée. It was one of the best desserts I have ever taste. The presentation, plating and the taste was perfectly luscious.Equinox serves premium cuisine with a premium price. Fine dining restaurants in a 5 star hotel is relatively pricey. However, once in a while if you want to indulge yourself and your loved ones, Equinox is perfect for any occasions. Rated this restaurant a perfect five as all my visits are pleasantly gratifying.

Spectacular views of Singapore, very good service, friendly attentive staff and a good menu. We were offerred a seat near the window....greatly appreciated. The only downside on the night was the price of the food and the cost of drinks. Our Grand Seafood Platter was quite small & only comprised cold seafood, about half the size of what we get in a comparable Sydney Restaurant and 30% more expensive. Wine / beer? ....well welcome to Singapore & the sin tax. Its our first time here & we cannot believe the cost of alcohol in Singapore.....generally double of what we are used to paying. So overall, loved the Equinox experience; a great " welcome to Singapore" in all ways, especially the high cost of wining & dining out....make sure there is plenty of room on your Credit Card!

We had dinner for two, paid extra to sit by the window. The view is as expected - spectacular. We got a birds eye view of the Marina Bay Sands light show, good idea to book dinner around that time (8-8.30pm). The food was of a very high standard, as is to be expected in this price bracket. The wine was not cheap, not much under $100 per bottle. The staff were polite and attentive. If you're after a blockbuster dinner location, it serves the purpose. But in a city so full of great food options, at the end of the night I felt my $500 probably could have been better spent on 3-4 more memorable dining experiences
3
We had the Traditional Afternoon Tea and it fulfilled our expectations but didn't necessarily overwhelm us. The food was good and the tea was adequate even though it would have been nice to have had the option of separate pots with different teas. Initially the staff seemed a little tired and indifferent, but then one of the waitresses surprised us by starting a pleasant conversation and explained some of the landmarks in the terrific views the restaurant has
4
I have visited this restaurant several times although, I hasten to add that my previous visit was some time ago. I was delighted to see the decor was wearing well and still felt fresh. The views are even most spectacular; as well as Boat Quay, Clarke Quay and the city there is now the bonus of the fabulous Marina Bay. The cooking was of a very high standard, my lamb main course both looked and tasted fabulous. The service was great and it is not often I can say that in Singapore, the staff was friendly and attentive without over doing it. It was a most enjoyable evening.One minor quibble, I think it appears very greedy to charge an extra $20 for a window seat, I would not have thought it necessary in a restaurant of this caliber. Tables by the window should be allocated on a first come first served basis. Although, when we received our bill they had removed the extra $20 - perhaps they thought we had spent enough!This restaurant is certainly worth going out of your way to visit
5
I brought my fiancee there to ask for her hand in marriage. Obviously when you have selected this kind of place, you have a higher chance in getting a yes for an answer. The view is just superb, you can literally see half of the city area from the window. I would suggest going for dinner, though, because it will be more beautiful when all the lights are already powered up.The quality of the food is fantastic as well. However I find the portion is rather small. I would expect something more considering that we are paying a lot for the meals. In general, a great experience. I would suggest going there with your loved ones on special occasions
4
Afternoon tea with a view. We got a last minute reservation here following recommendations from our hotel. We were not disappointed. Afternoon tea is served in Equinox restaurant on the 69th floor which gives you panoramic skyline views of the city. Stylish décor, quick efficient service and great food. An excellent choice for an afternoon treat! The sandwiches were what you would expect, small bite size pieces, however the cakes were intricate in design and bursting with flavours. All divine. The rum and raisin cup was potentially boozy. Worth a trip
5
Best place to entertain business guests or have a nice couples dinner. Best time to go is in the evening before the sunset. You can have drinks at cityscape( which is on the same floor ) then carry on with dinner. The restaurant has perfect view of the marina Bay Area. Food is great: starting from complimentary bread basket to the delicious desserts, everything is delectable. We were a group of 6 and everyone was happy with the food they ordered. Feel free to get the recommendation from the staff serving you. They are very helpful.

Our last day of our 5 week holiday to Australia had to be special so our travel agent booked us in here on our return journey. It's on the 70th floor of the Swissotel on Stamford. The lift is hidden around the back of the foyer & should be better signed, this is the only gripe. When eventually you arrive at the restaurant you are treated to a magnificent view over the city & harbour, to sit at a window table at this height & to watch the lights come on as the night came down is slightly surreal. If you time it right you are treated to a Lazer light show over the harbour too. The food selection was fairly eclectic & very good, also it was cooked to just how we like it. The service from the staff was exemplary, you are treated as a guest & all were helpful & pleasant in interpreting the menu. The final bill was a bit pricey but we both agreed it was worth it for the experience. Thank you Equinox but I think I will have to get a paper round to help afford the next visit

Get a window table. Breathtaking views and worth the $20 extra. Book ahead to get a window seat.Food and wine is very expensive but for such a location you would expect that. Menu choices are limited. Food is of a very high standard and service attentiveHowever 2 things. They didn't check our bill before it arrived and charged us for a dessert which was out of stock. Then they did not give us the discount on the bill for booking online till the waitress doubled checked the bill herself laterSecondly signage in and out of the restaurant is non existent. We got lost looking for the exitWould only go again for a special occasion as the food is expensiv

I get to Singapore on average once every two years. I always try to ensure my visit includes a Sunday, simply to enjoy Equinox’s Champagne Brunch - this was my fifth in eight years and it was as good as ever. However, my Singapore friends have always insisted on paying and I checked the price before reviewing and I was surprised to see it was an expensive S$178 per person for the free flow Pink Champagne Buffet that I enjoyed. Its been a memorable experience but for that sort of price I think next time I think I might try for some different memories in one of the many other tempting Singapore Sunday Brunch options
4
Was there during my ex-comp Xmas lunch celebration with my spouse in 2010. The place was really nice and ambience was great. You can to enjoy panoramic view of Singapore and great scenes of the CBD area from far. Prices were expensive but really worth it. Will visit if chance permits again!

My wife and I did the High Tea at the Stamford on our honeymoon back in 1989, when the restaurant was known as the Compass Rose. 25 years later and back in Singapore we decided to head down to see if they still did the High Tea. They do, and now it's called the Equinox Restaurant. After the express ride in the lift to the 70th floor we were not disappointed. We had not booked so were one table back from the window but you wander around and find great vantage spots for photos or selfies. The staff were very pleasant and helpful. We ordered the 'Traditional Afternoon Tea' from the menu for S$45. You pay 15% service charge so our bill was S$51.75. The 3 tier tray was full of Sandwiches, Pastries and Scones with homemade Strawberry jam and Devonshire clotted cream, and a selection of small cakes. Included is a pot of tea for each person (about 3 cups each) or cup of coffee (choices are English Breakfast, Earl Grey, Chun Mee Green Tea, Moroccan Mint, Coffee, Latte or Cappuccino). Open from 3.30pm until 5pm for High Tea from Monday to Saturday and 4pm to 5pm on Sundays. If you can book ahead for window seat (phone: +65 6837 3322 ) or email: reservations@equinoxcomplex.com.

Me and my partner dine in last 15th of Jan as it was her bday. Upon making a reservation the gentlemen who took our reservation says that the only table available is at 8:15 fair enough. I requested for window sit and the other party on the phone says it's full. Subject to availability but we can get it if we pay extra $20. That's surprising full but if we add $20 we can get have a window so I say ok.. As its my partner bday and it's her favorite restaurant.. I ask if they can prepare a cake for her. Reservation say no we don't do that.. There was a little silly again.. People celebrate important event yet there is no service support.. Ok.. ??? Obviously people go there and celebrate for some important event so where is the service gone and availability.. Again he told us that we can have a cake but we have to order a dessert then tits written on the dessert plate!!! Again I have to order to get that.. So I say ok we will order the dessert.. Upon arrival there was nobody in the level1 who normally great and check the reservation.. So we proceed on Equinox finding our way alone.. Used to have host there to usher guest up..upon arrival on the reception in restaurant itself the table was not a window side as what we expect as I pay extra $$$20. It was Disappointment my partner is unhappy so we talk to the host. And waited for another 15mins just to get the window side table. We finally sat down. Drinks was all ok even its so slow and I have to raise my hand to get the attention.. On proper dinner we order the beef/steak for 2 person. Looks yummy. Food served but there was a hair wrapped around the beef. Noted that our meal was cut by the waiter during preparations before its served on the table. I t was a very long hair to wrapped in the meat. Talk to the manager not even a single apology happened and he said we will replaced!! Ok so we waited again. There was no food served or something to munch while waiting for almost 20mins for the new beef.. It's was really annoying. Some order the dessert as for the bday surprise or writing. dessert arrived with nothing on the plate.. We waited maybe thinking that was the final surprised after all then hustle earlier. We ask the bill and nothing. Didn't see any manager around. No apology and bday dessert writing nothing .. And we didn't order just like that our bill was almost $800 for the a very disappointing experienced.. Broken promised u deliver service and disappointing food.. The only thing is fun fantastic was the drink line. Brought my partner to the bar in cityspace that the only best that happen. I wish to have a proper explanation on the service render to us

We celebrated my birthday here last night and had booked a table by the window (you do not have to pay an additional $20 if you are staying in the hotel.) The food was excellent, beautifully presented and accompanied by some excellent wines. They serve a complimentary amuse-bouche and selection of bread to begin your meal. The Colorado Lamb was perfectly cooked, and my partner's combination of Pork Cheeks and Pork Belly was delicious. Unfortunately, we had no room for dessert, however did share an assortment of cheeses. My only complaint was they all appeared to be French and I think some of our Australian cheeses would be fabulous. The views of Singapore at night are fantastic and you get a real sense of how the city have been developed and continues to expand. A lovely way to celebrate a milestone.

we had been warned it was pricey - but to be honest it was reassuringly expensive.Great food, fantastic attentive staff, deserts to die for, and an amazing location looking out over the city and Indonesia or Malaysia depending on where you sit.We were given an offer of Moet Champagne at £50 a bottle - which is amazingly cheap in Singapore and worth while asking for - book it, go - excellent.As for a table adjacent to a window - it is an extra $20 but well worth it

I could never resist the desserts here. Food is good as expected from the price you pay. But the attraction is really the view.Pay extra $20 and get a table window side. It's worth it since you're splurging anyway. Ladies bring a shawl or cardigan as it get chilly from the AC

Loved the view, weird being so high up but showed Singapore. Funny that we could not get in till 8.30pm yet when we arrived they were empty. We went to the restaurant and got out of the lift and weren't too sure where to go, we should have got out at the other restaurant.....the receptionists were there. We climbed up the stairs and met the receptionist and were taken back down the stairs grrrr. Anyway finally settled at the window table, no white table cloths, just a wooden table but suppose that is a sign of the times but for the prices I did expect it. Anyway all food was good and magnificent. Wine horrendously over priced but that is Singapore. Waiter laughed when I told him that a glass of wine was $15 max and that would be for a very good wine, think we were paying about $2

Been there as a Anniversary + Bday for my wifey. Me in law and she were there. I booked earlier and paid extra for a window seating. Approx 30$ if i remember clearly.They have complimentary starters and awesome flavoured breads to go with your dinner.Loved the ambiance and view. Service was equally adept and good. One of the best scallops and lobsters i have tasted.If you have Amex, Plat G cards its 50% off for 2 ppl

My husband and I had Sunday brunch with my parents. From the delicious buffet to the freeflow Moet & Chandon to the Espresso Martini, it was delicious. I started with the wide selection of sushi and sashimi, which was so fresh. My favorite was the macaroni cheese... with black truffle - amazing! The selection seemed endless and everything I tasted was of 5 star quality. The service was good and the live music was stunning as well. A lively way to spend a Sunday

Went Equinox for lunch with my hubby on our 9th wedding anniversary on 8 January 2015. Was a very good lunch with great atmosphere and great foods. Good service and very quiet place for us to spend our lovely lunch. Thank you all the staffs at Equinox Restaurant.Just a little issue which is the lipstick stain on the cup when we were served with our tea. But that is alright, just a reminder for the server to note next time
1
We had dinner at Equinox to celebrate a birthday. We therefore reserved a table well in advance and required a window seat.We decided to go with the 5-course tasting menue accompanied with a wine pairing.The interior of the restaurant and the view are very impressive. Also, the staff is friendly enough and trying its best.In general the courses are fine enough but definitely do not live up to the expectations the restaurant tries to foster. Moreover, minor faults and constant neglectfulness throughout the evening left us with a rather negative impression.Wines didn't arrive at the same time as the courses, allergy warnings were left unattended and red wine was served in white wine glasses. I expect more from a restaurant in this price segment.When confronting the restaurant manager with our feedback at the end of the evening, he reacted rather defensive than understanding. It seemed that his Italian ego was injured and he was rather busy trying to prove us wrong instead of just admitting that things didn't go the way they were supposed to go that night.Hereby, he missed the last chance to make things up. All in all: a big disappointment
4
Me and wifey decided to have a quiet weekend lunch without the kids at Equinox. Semi-buffet at reasonable price, given the "high-end" location. Overall, the food was OK (this is after all a buffet) but the breathtaking scenery and excellent service more than made up for any shortfall in food expectations

It's become a tradition for us to eat here for Christmas lunch. We've done it for about the last 7 years and never really been let down. Location is excellent - especially if you get the window seat (although the sun can be hot). And the staff are generally good as well. Its good because they only have one sitting - so you can take as long as you want (up to 3pm when they close). Some places have two sittings. It's quite Christmassy - they always have live music, Santa comes around (you can have your photo taken with him), entertainment eg table magician and crackers etc (although this year they cut back - no poppers, streamers or blowers)Food is good with a wide selection of traditional Western Christmas food and Asian dishes. Starters are generally good and good selection. For main courses, they carve the turkey, beef, ham, pork etc in front of you (AND don't be afraid of asking for the turkey leg!! I always do and they always ask 'How do you want it carved?' I don't - just give me the whole leg!! Its surprising how many people then copy me!). Good selection of veg. There is fish as well - whole poached salmon, crab, prawns and scallops (they were a bit dry this year). Asian dishes are just as varied. Deserts are OK as well. And they have Christmas pud!!Drinks are included - it's all freeflow drink as much as you can - and last year they introduced pink champagne as well as traditional white champagne. But you can also have cocktails - they were quite good - as well as wines. You can also have soft drinks. Bottle water is also included. So overall it is good, although it is a tad expensive, about SGD575 for two adults with freeflow. TIPSHave a seat by the window for a first class viewIf you go somewhere else, make sure they only have one sittingDon't be afraid to ask for 'More champagne, please!

Very nice ambient for wedding anniversary celebration, plus the view from the top. I appreciated the services accorded to us. Good enough selection on the menu. We got Seafood and Ribeye. Both tasted fantastic. Thank you for making the day enjoyable for us. (Would have been better if we have been given the window seat to celebrate the occasion.

Equinox offered us the best dinner during four evenings in Singapore, although it was also the most expensive one. With such a great service and wonderful views, we were still satisifed.It was a late dinner so we skipped appertizers. We ordered marinated swordfish which was excellent; well seasoned and very tasty.White wines recommended by the waitress went along nicely with fish.Steamed broccolini as side order was a disappointment. It was almost tasteless and not up to the quality of main course.The chocolate dessert with truffles and other sweets were good too, as was their suggested sweet dessert wine.Equinox was a nice experience and left me a good feeling about Singapore, as it was our last in the city.You pay for the view as many others have said, but I think it's worth the money at least once per trip, at least if you're lucky to get as good food as we got.We also tried to get there a couple of days earlier, but it was full. Reserving a table is recommended. They charge an extra fee if you want a table by the window

Bookings essential but being hotel guest under royal service in Fairmont hotel,we get a table for two through a call reservation. Entrees cold dishes not the most selection i hv seen including the main at buffet table. Prices are very steep with or without champagne at $170 PER PERSON. .can get a birdeye view from the 73 floor so ensure you max yr time as you may not go back again.desserts are disappointment given the price n name

Located at the top of swissotel Stamford hotel, the view is to die for.Food is very nice and you get what you for...which is the view of the marina skyline towards marina bay sands (another iconic building in singapore)Long queue to get in at weekend

The chosen venue tonight is Equinox @ Swissotel Stamford, for its magnificent cityscape views, high floor-dining and elegant ambience.We chose a Windows Seat so that we could dine with this kind of view looming in front of us. Yes, the night seemed to come alive, and the view is breathtaking - I believe Singapore's sensual night views have overtaken many urban cities' in recent years. The glowing Singapore Flyer making its rounds against the dark nightskies, the colors of the various skycrapers flanking the iconic MBS, and the Laser Shows etc were all worth the extra SGD$20.00 we paid for the windows seat.The Beau had a starter of Duck Consomme, Braised Duck Leg, Truffle Ravioli (SGD$20.00) . The consomme broth was herbal in nature, but strangely warm instead of hot, hence the grease was illuminated. The ravioli melted in the mouth, and the braised duck leg was crispy around the edges; the pairing was excellent.For mains, The Beau had the Slow-cooked Pork Cheek and Belly, Mushroom Escabeche, Coriander (SGD$58.00). The pork cheek was not cooked to a tenderness as I had hoped it to be, but instead was crisp and delicious in a chewy manner. The pork belly flanked some fatty parts and was an overall texture tease of tender flesh and bouncy parts.For desserts, we shared a Poached William Pear (SGD$18.00)- with scented Rooibos tea, honey, lemongrass sorbet and served with a lovely dash of dry ice, making the place so beautifully misty. The lemongrass sorbet was utterly refreshing, and paired with the grainy-textured sweetened pear, made this dessert an excellant choice.For full review and more photographs, please feel free to visit:http://thearcticstar.blogspot.sg/2014/12/dinner-at-equinox-swisshotel-stamford.htm

The view that you get from equinox over the marina bay is quite simply stunning, we went in the evening and the lights of the city certainly make for a wonderful sight. However, while the food is good and service efficient, if not a little self-effacing, I wouldn't rush back. There are better places to eat, with more exciting food and/or more reasonably priced. So while I would recommend everyone to go there once, as it is an amazing experience, I think it is the type of place that you don't need to go back to time and time again
5
The view is stunning. For Singapore standards. High tea is not too expensive sin dollar 45,- for 2 persons. Delicious high tea. Great staff and again amazing view. Opens at 3:30pm. Reservation recommended. Dress smart casual
4
The restaurant has the panoramic view of Singapore marina center, excellent! If you are out to impress, this is the location to choose. The food and service is average.
3
70 floors up and the view was astonishing. So too were the prices but unfortunately the food quality was tres ordinaire. Reminded me of a golden rule of dining I once heard: Don't eat in a restaurant that rotates, floats....
4
Never thought I would go p to the 70th floor for dinner but the view was absolutely spectacular. The menu was interesting and the staff very attentive. Food was excellent and so was the wine. A lovely last evening in Singas.

I took my friends to Equinox to have dinner. It is on level 70 at the centre of city, no doubt it has a great city view. It is European restaurant but it is a pity that it doest have European specified menu. They provide good quality of steak with a choice of sauce. Personally Im not steak lover but the truffle sauce was so appetizing. Based on the menu we ordered, they were good over all. But maybe it would be better if they have a couple of signature dish that impress ppl bc customers have higher expectations to this kind of high end restaurants. In my opinion, this will be more suitable if you have guests who come around Singapore to show them nice night views with a dinner
3
It had been a while since I had been to the Equinox restaurant and so when a friend visited from the US , I decided to take him there for dinner and drinks. The view is still great. We ordered a crab cake appetizer to share , a miso cod and pork belly for the main course, and a Banana fritter for dessert. The appetizer was good, the cod ok , and dessert was good. The pork unfortunately was tough and tasted like something that I could have whipped up at home. I would say go here for the view but don't go with high expectations for the food
5
Just had lunch at Jaan today and was impressed with the excellent service.When we mentioned to the waiter (he asked how the food was)that the oyster was not fresh, he thanked us for the feedback and the manager came shortly after. She then offered us a plate of freshly opened oysters, complete with cavier and lemon. When the time for lunch was up and we have yet to finish our meal, the manager apologetically explained that they need to clear the place for the high tea buffet and suggested that we shift to another place. We even got a complimentary coffee. Thank you for the excellent service
4
The restaurant was very quiet even though it was on a Friday afternoon. We went there for hi-tea to celebrate my aunty's birthday. The 3-tier layer of scones, sandwiches & mini cakes were good. The sushi platter taste fresh and nice but 8 pieces of sushi for $22++ is a bit expensive. It has such beautiful scenery as you eat and enjoy the view. The service was good and staff attentive. As it was my aunty's birthday, the restaurant gave her a piece of complimentary birthday cake. So nice and thoughtful of them
4
We came here for semi lunch buffet. Impressive view once stepped out from the elevator. We were seated at a table facing THE VIEW. It was nice to take some time and observe the area instead of being inside the CBD on a normal working day. The decor was interesting but i didnt really like the wood carving in the middle of the path while walking to the buffet table. We ordered our mains, salmon and pork belly. Both turned out to be very delicious. Salmon was not fishy at all and i am very sensitive to fishy smell. The mustard sauce was really good with the fish although it was a bit runny. I love the pork belly skin which was very thin and crisp. The salad bar was very good. I like the tapas area where they have the nicest dips with chips. The oysters were fresh but not very juicy and fat, lemons ran out fast. I skipped rest of the seafood section and didnt try the japanese section since i already had my doze of omega 3 from the seared salmon but my husband did mentioned the soba was overcooked. The dessert section was a dream. I liked the creme brulee, the lingonberry cake, the fruits. Our favourite was the brownie. It was very very delicious. The chocolate cake however was a bit soggy, it should have been chilled, the mousse was falling all over which was a pity since the chocolate was rich and nice. The pistachio ice cream was very good, soft and almost felt like i was back in Italy. My husband liked the sorbet. Service was very attentive. Plates were cleared fast and efficient. Overall, i enjoyed my experience

After some advice restaurant was recommended as a special place to go for our "big number" wedding anniversary. Fantastic views over Singapore. Staff attentive, but what a disappointment when menu was perused. We tried to choose something different to try each other's Hubby had an entree, tiny in portion size and very average. I chose Pork - two different types on plate. So small a portion, I wished I had ordered an entree. Hubby had Scorpion fish dish. It looked like a stew when it arrived and on a brown plate which made it look very unpalatable. I had a sweet, very average. They did give us a tiny piece of cake as they knew it was our anniversary, which was a nice gesture.Think we are too used to high quality restaurant food at half the cost in Australia. We would not recommend this restaurant for a special occasion, maybe for the view only
5
I didn't realise I was 70 floors up! The view was spectacular. The menu was very interesting and the food was very good. Service was excellent. Very expensive but worth the visit. Had a lovely evening.
5
dine in 70 floor is very exiting, Great food and service, semi buffet style on Lunch Time. Over all is GREAT.
4
Very nice restaurant on top of a 69 st. building. Nice view. Good food but high end prices. The desert was not really good. Not a real Italian lemon sorbet ice.
4
Booked dinner reservation through our hotel. Seated promptly, no nonsense about extra money for a window table.The views are excellent and so was the service. very friendly and personable servers, explained all the menu options.I had the Miso Cod which was delicious and my wife enjoyed her filet
5
The equinox is known to have one of the most spectacular views of the Signapore skyline, but that's not the only thing you'll find at Equinox. We were overwhelmed by the exquisite service delivered by Diaz, restaurant manager. His vibrant character had us laughing every time he came to the table and not to mention the attentive service he delivered. Nicol

One of the best restaurants I have ever visited! Equinox offers spectacular views of Singapore and much more. Take a ride on the elevator to the 70th floor to see just what this place has to offer. Don’t worry, the ride is quick and once you step off the elevator, you will be delighted to see panoramic crystal clear views of Singapore and the surrounding area. Reserve a table next to the window for dinner to see the lights twinkle in the night.The entire vibe of the place was magnificent. The staff was extremely courteous and attentive. The menu (al a cart) consist of items such as tenderloin, succulent chicken, fresh salmon, pork loin, creamy mashed potatoes, asparagus, macaroni and cheese and broccoli with a chili sauce. I ordered the tenderloin (well done) with a butter truffle sauce and creamy mashed potatoes. If there was only one word to describe my steak, it would be “juicy”. My steak was cooked to perfection! My guest, who ordered the chicken with macaroni and cheese, describes his chicken as “melt in your mouth delicious”. We decided to visit Equinox a second time to see what the “Semi Buffet Lunch” had to offer. Let’s just say, you will not be disappointed! Oysters, clams, shrimp, crab, caviar, sushi, humus, duck salad, chicken salad, soup, assorted breads, cheeses, grapes, strawberries, watermelon, cantaloupe, crème bru la, cream puffs, mango cake, home made ice cream with a variety of topping and sorbet! This is just for starters. The main course offered some of the same entrees as dinner. I enjoyed the steak again while my guest enjoyed the snapper! Dinner cost about $100 USD per person to include one cocktail, main course and a side.Lunch cost about $85 USD per person to include on beverage, main course and buffet.Bottom Line: If you want an impressive array of foods, excellent service and a view that will take your breath away try having lunch at Equinox. If you are looking for a spectacular place to wine, dine, relax and just enjoy life make a dinner reservation. Either way I hope you enjoy
5
There are many places to get a good view of Singapore, but this was my favorite. You get a much better understanding of just how dense the urban landscape is. Enjoyed a glass of scotch with a colleague while lounging in plush seats in front of the floor to ceiling windows. Perfect night cap.

Located at the top of Swissotel, this restaurant boasts of a bird’s eye view that has a far reaching gaze over a good part of Singapore. We were there for a birthday celebration and made our reservations beforehand. At first when we called a day before, there was no table available. Then on the day itself Equinox called and told us that there was an available table for 4 for us and that if we didn’t confirm within the next hour then they would give the table to someone else. We were excited for a while and jumped at the opportunity to have our dinner there. Reservation at a window seat requires you to pay an additional $20! That’s almost daylight robbery but we decided to go ahead given that it was a special occasion. This place is a fine dining place, so no slippers or shorts were allowed. Although somewhat enforced by the staff, they do make exceptions if you’re elderly because I personally saw some older folks wearing sandals in the restaurant. Being a fine dining establishment, I expected service to be tiptop and hassle free. Unfortunately my experience there was not as such. The dining area we were allocated was so dark, we couldn’t even read the menus properly. The floor also seemed to be made of hollow wood, because whenever a fellow customer or waiter/waitress walked by, the sound of the footsteps were so accentuated and created such a noise. Even getting the attention of the waiter was difficult. Either it was really too dark to see us wave to them, or they were so shorthanded that night that they didn’t have enough staff to tend to us. Either reason was no excuse for them not to spot us, given that this place is already so expensive. I expected the quality of the service to be much better! Towards the end of the meal, the service seemed to have improved when the waiters were more attentive but the damage was done at the start of our meal there. Food wise the portions are not great, but the food was prepared to a very precise detail. Each of the dishes were so intricately designed that we couldn’t bear to take it apart to eat it. Kudos to the chef for the great attention paid to the smallest detail. That particular night was not the clearest and so there were no dazzling lights. However the view from the restaurant is not something that we get to see everyday so we just made the best use of it. The food was good, but service needs improvement. I felt that the price we paid for the service was not justified. The experience here was not amazing and didn’t leave me yearning for more. Overall 4 stars for this dining encounter

I've had a few champagne brunches in my time, but this was an outstanding experience. Being the last Sunday of the month, there was a pink theme - balloons, waiter outfits & Moet. Other than a stunning view over Singapore, we were kept enthralled by a magician and a balloon entertainer. Service was attentive and knowledgeable, food was amazing and we had a thoroughly good time
1
This restaurant was the biggest disappointment of our stay in Singapore I ordered Foie Gras and my wife ordered chowder, The Foie Gras was nice but not worth $34.00 ++ the chowder was not chowder it was bisque. Main course was Chateaubriand for two $170.00 ++ we had to pick two sauces and two vegetables to go with it.The vegetables were Mixed Leaves Salad  Mashed Potatoes Steamed Broccolini with Ginger, Garlic, Chilli,  Macaroni Cheese, Beer-Battered Onion Rings Black Truffle or French Fries The only vegetable that goes close to being served with Chateaubriand is mashed potatoes. Our table was behind a railing I'm 6.0 and had trouble seeing the view anyone shorter like my wife couldn't see it at all. Our Chateaubriand was carved at the next table so my wife had her back to it. We ordered a bottle of Moet to celebrate our anniversary which was being promoted with a small gift. The gift was not given to us so we had to ask for it which was rather uncomfortable. Our table over looked where the staff stacked dirty plates on trays before going to the kitchen not a nice view. Also don't order still water unless you don't mind paying $15.00 a bottl

From the 70th floor of the Swisshotel Stamford, this restaurant has the most amazing view of Singapore. The food and wines are excellent as well as is the service. A great place to celebrate a special occasion.
5
A jaw dropping view across Singapore. The staff are good, and the food is very good, however the view wins hands down. A great wine list, and an excellent venue to take clients.
5
Although very expensive it was a worthwhile treat. The views of Singapore are outstanding and the buffet food was varied and delicious. Staff incredibly friendly and welcoming too.

Booked a table for dinner on a Tue night. Was not too crowded but all the seats by the window was taken up. Requested for a birthday cake when walking in and they said they'll come back to me. However they completely forgotten about it. Ordered wine and food which was okay. Nothing WOW about it but was pretty decent. One of the service staff who was topping up our glasses were having an attitude. Wonder what's up with her. Overall it's just a restaurant with a view. It's just the experience if you have some money to spend. Otherwise there are other places with better food and service. My two cents worth.

We were there for semi buffet lunch on my mom's birthday celebration. As the previous celebration here was a good experience, we were happy to come again this time but it turned out to be disappointing. I sent in a request for window seat and mentioned about the special event as I understand first come first served. We were directed to a inner table and their excuse was no window table was available when I asked. However, shortly after, I personally saw 2 guests from another table was moved to window table when they asked. As I persisted, they finally arranged for me another table near the entrance. They used to have more options including my favorite beef for their main course but it seemed that they cut cost and omit the beef option, instead you have to pay extra for it. So we ordered chicken and risotto, both turned out so bad. Chicken was bland and risotto was uncooked. We had to ask for it to be cooked again. It came out, still not as good. We gave feedback about the chicken, the waitress was nice, did offer an exchange but we declined. Overall, the experience was disappointing and we will not return again. Want good view and fantastic experience? Salt Grill and Bar has much better to offer

First time to try this restaurant with my wife and my son to celebrate my birthday. Feel amazed with its spectacular view facing the marina bay sands.On food, the buffet lunch offered a wide array of seafood, sushi, salad, cheese bar, dessert, fruit and ice cream plus a selection of 5-6 different main courses. Salmon was fresh but with limited choice of sushi. Shrimps were huge and fresh, but oysters and crab were pretty tiny. Clams and muscle were good to have a try. I have tired the pork belly for the main course but free range chicken ordered by my wide was not very nice.The most impressed part of the buffet was that you can pick many different ingredients and sauce to mix your salad. You will also like the dessert section if you love sweet.Enjoy the skyline of Singapore with the lovely food
5
Great food, good service and an amazing view. What more could you want? Not having to pay an extra $20 to get a window seat!!! Perhaps give people time to study the menu before wanting to take their order. That would be my only recommendation for an otherwise lovely meal.. It's by far the best place to see the laser and light show from The Marina Bay Sands nightly at 8pm
2
Decided to go for daughter's 13th bday, told hostess on arrival of the big event but only after up charging me $20 for a window seat which seemed to be her priority (btw - our bill was $700, so her silly $20 charge wasn't an issue...)Food is good, great presentation but you can certainly leave hungry given the portions. We waited to see if they would bring a cake/candle to sing happy bday, but we got nothing. I wasn't going to chase them around, so we left completely dissatisfied. Cake was had in the end - at home!!!Great view, waiters are good - hostess is an fool.Dined - Sept 17th, 8pmGood luck!

A revisit to celebrate our anniversary, had informed the reservation about the occasion and to arrange a quiet corner away from the crowd as we just would like to have a quality dinner time, and...we did get a corner table just right by the stairs leading to the split level...with the couple beside us keeping us entertained with the guy walking over to his lady, hugging her closely for a selfie pic almost after every dish was served to them. I had wanted to offer my help...but the waitor was quicker than me. dang. Maybe it's just me, but I thought...it would have just been right if the reservation was sensitive and thoughtful enough to arrange a table along the window (with the nice view) at the info of an important affair for the incoming diners. If a certain fast food restaurant could surprise my baby cousin with all the crew popping out to sing the lil one a birthday song during her party, I just thought a 5-star restaurant could do better during mine. But, I could be asking too much...I'm sorry. Please ignore my blabbering...Service staff on site was friendly and attentive. Had tried ordering a concoction that was not on the menu, and they just made that happen. Perfect as a 5-star restaurant should be in this department. But of course, the word "specially made" does cost. FYI for those thinking of repeating such feat. :DFood was excellent. Highly recommending their Chateaubriand, with the choice of 2 sauces and 2 sides. A-grade tenderloin. We had it well done (cos I hate the sight of blood) and it still melts in the mouth. We had the urge to order another serving actually...but we decided to pull the handbrake and not overdo it. :pThere were 8 tables in the split level section, and a designated crew of 1 captain + 1 waitor taking care of them in general, with the support of other captains to the more important tables within. Constant lookout for a nudge from you for assistance, and the regular checks on you to make sure everything is fine, though sometimes the questions do come a little untimely when you could be caught rather awkward with your mouth full of food.... I just didn't know if I should look up to smile with an oily mouth, or to squeeze "I'm fine" through my teeth and those food in my mouth. Needs some work on the details...Setbacks:It's rather humid at the restaurant. Wear light to dinner at the restaurant. Ladies, leave the mink and coat at home or you will be sweating like a pig, which...would will make you score an own goal many a time the entire night.Ventilation seems to be a consistent issue with the premise since many years back. It's a rare sight you'd get to see a standing fan (something that would appear right beside your mahjong table in the living room) at where (maybe) a Victorian vase could have been. Or, a heavy duty industrial fan spinning in the background from a corner. A little bit more and you may be disillusioned that you are attending a 7th month gala dinner somewhere around your HDB estate, if you get what I mean. :DBut I can't blame them. To be unglam, or to be slammed, if I'm the boss, I'd rather be unglam. Kasper Kor, was the Captain serving us. Pardon me if I got your rank wrong. But for a customer to walk away remembering a service staff's name, there could only be 2 reasons: His/her service was very good, or very bad.I did make a casual remark about the humidity when the bill came and the protocol apologies was offered. But what we did not expect was he had came after us to the smoking lounge (yes! it's still there one floor down! ^^) downstairs offering a formal apologies and offer several options of complementary to make us feel compensated. Shamefully, as he approached us, we were just looking through the bill to see if we were being charged correctly. (blush) But we didn't oblige to his offer anyway, for we thought if there should be any discomfort experienced during the dinner, they were all covered by the kind gesture and intention. Sometimes, it is just that simple.We have dined at restaurants around the island and noticed a rising trend these 5-6 years, with local F&B outlets beginning to offer different standards towards patrons of different nationalities, races, appearance, and so on, especially at high end premises such as this one. But, at Equinox, I must say we felt at ease and truly enjoy our dinner that evening. At that level of spending, we actually thought it was all worth it because we did receive the equal value of food, drinks, and were certainly being pampered.Coupled by the great view to die for and a new layout (away from the old clustered one), we are looking forward to be returning for another round of good food. can't wait

This is a perfect place to dine in Singapore with a view of MBS and CBD! You will need to pay extra for the perfect view, which is in the middle of the restaurant with 3 tables, and it's definitely worth it. The food quality is pretty average compared to the price you pay. We had Jamon and smoked salmon for appetizer, followed by chateaubriand for 2 for main course, and creme brûlée for dessert. The service was impeccable though!
3
This place would be so awesome if their food and service could compare to the view!!
Go upstairs to the night club for a good time after dinner.
5
This is a truly sensational place and buffet lunch for 60 Singapore dollars cheap for what it was. I had caviar, oysters lobster and all the food treasures of the planet. The views are breath taking, the service excellent and classy. Must return place.
4
visited this place in September on an offocial dinner. to my opinion food is good but not outstanding...there are many reataurant in singapore where you can find similar good food with a reasonable price. for a set menue of 5 course the price was $180. the beef and fish was very good

Situated at top floor of swissotel the stamford known as equinox complex now, had high expectation as i dine in at Jaan ( fine dinning resturant) at same floor, heard a lot about equinox returant high tea thought to give a try on weekend , made reseravation in advance for 3 window seats which always fully booked if you dont get it reserved in advance, setting was bit compaq may be they tried to fit more tables can understand as biz point of view but not suitable for such high rated place , spread was above average though no complaints about food quality , n boy the heat d place was way too warm , can understand at such high floor rays are harsh they must do something about it , place was over corwded n noisy for my taste. staff was always occupied with other stuff which leads to lack of quality in over all service, no doubt view was good but as i mentioned earlier it was too hot for most of us. i had better time at New asia bar and jaan , dont think so will indulge for high tea at equinox again very mediocore experinced !

Had our anniversary dinner there. Love the wonderful view... :D We enjoyed the ambience there and paid a little extra to be seated by the window so that we could enjoy the superb view.Interestingly, we truly love the breads that were served. They were simply yummy and even if we did not order the main course, we would have been satisfied as we are bread lovers.Service was good and overall we enjoyed the food and the company
4
The cost was only a mere 59++ for a part-buffet Lunch with a fantastic view. I was really worth it, there were Oysters, Caviar, Crabs, a good selection of desserts. The only think I would comment about was that the main dish was cold on the inside. So watch out!!! However the Steak was FAN-TAS-TIC. Another rule I hate was the ONLY 1 ORDER of Coffee and TEA. I wouldn't say it was a big portion of tea/coffee, so maybe thats the down point. But other then that, it was a beautiful lunch by the window with a view to remember

Being at level 69 of Swissotel The stamford, you can't get better view of singapore city than here.the resto has good service, fast and informative. the food & beverages serving is quite an art, tasted nice too. Suitable for business, family and romantic date with your couple especially at night
3
It could have been such a different story. We were sat and then left alone for nearly 30 minutes with no drinks or no one asking to take our order. That, unfortunately, set a bad tone for the whole evening that the fantastic food (decent value even at 400 dollars for our dinner) and views were difficult to repair. Wouldn't return again. Get just as good a view and more affordable food on top of the Marina Bay Sands in my opinion
4
Took my wife her for our 4th Wedding Anniversary this year. Excellent View from up top. Food was nice too, but pricey for what it was, Same goes for Alcohol Prices. Good experience overally but decrease the prices and more customers will come. 8/10. We had to reserve a window for a price too. Luckily we didn't get charged for toilet paper by the sheet
4
Was there with 2 other friends for high tea. Arrived earlier than 3.30pm which was the start of the high tea. All of us and a few different groups of tourist were told to wait at the waiting area till 3.27pm. There were limited seats available and quite a few were standing instead. My friend wanted decaff tea which was out of the standard menu but they served it to us anyway without additional charge.
5
The view is absolutely fantastic and the food is good.
However, be aware that prices are at the high end for a dinner in Singapore.
3
Went up to see the views and have a drink. After seeing the drink menu we decided to have a coffee - one cappuccino and a double espresso. Coffee was good but definitely not worth S$40 we had to pay for it!
5
This restaurant is situated on the 70th floor of the Swissotel Stamford and features amazing views of Singapore. We had a multiple course chef-selected meal that lasted a few hours complete with wine pairings. Each course featured amazing combinations of flavors to savor. this was definitely a "special" dining experience
4
At the highest spot in Singapore, you simply can't get enough of the views. Spectacular. We went for the famous brunch, which was very rich, tasty and you can certainly squeeze a lot till 2.30pm when your bill is served and you are asked to leave (make sure you come early). Drinks and extras are not included, and on the pricey side for what it is. But for a special occasion and at least once if you visit Singapore - worth the hype. And brung a good camera too
3
I have heard so much about this place and my expectations were really high. Visited on a weekend with NDP rehearsals and got to see the fireworks which was great, other than that food took quite long to come, service staff repeated the orders and still got one of the orders wrong. My utensils were placed in a manner to show that I was not done with eating, yet service staff wanted to clear it whereas my friends' plates showed that it was ready to be cleared but they didn't clear. I felt like minor things like this that matter, shouldn't even happen at such a place
4
This is a great restaurant to visit on Sunday for brunch with the family. We particularly love the Foie Gras, Japanesel Sashimi, Kurobuta Pork Belly, Miso-roasted Black Cod and comprehensive spread of international selections At 70th floor of Swissotel, with high ceiling and modern deco, you get a bird's eye view of Singapore's city landscape
5
This restaurant has good memories for me. I have been staying in Swissotel The Stamford for more than 25 years and this restaurant I have been visiting for more than 10 years. This restaurant setting is wondeful and private. A very larger version than our Sydney Summit restaurant. This Equinox Restaurant has better class and service mainly because of the 5 Stars dining image.and situated in a 5 Stars hotel. I would recommend this restaurant for a good romantic evening overlooking Singapore waterfront, with view of the Singapore waterfront, Singapore eyes,Singapore casino and so on. Beautifull view and a good meal.

My friend and I had high tea $45 for two people with a bottle of Moet $88. For the price I was dissapointed with the serving size - 2x tiny scones, 3 x basic sandwiches and a selection of cakes. The food was nice there just wasn't enough of it. Also the service was poor - even though we were one of only two tables our drinks weren't topped up. We waited a long time to even catch their attention.The worst part for me though was I was given a wet plate to eat high tea off. Surely they should be getting something so basic right?! I would suggest a visit, the place has great views and a beautiful setting but just stick with the Moet deal and eat elsewhere.
5
My wife and I had Sunday Brunch at Equinox Restaurant with my brother and his wife (who are currently living in Singapore).It is a set price (either with or without alcohol) smorgasbord brunch, but the range and quality of food is very good.The staff were very good and attentive (although very busy) and made us feel welcome and valued.A duet played pleasant music through the afternoon and a magician walked around the tables entertaining people as well (which was very enjoyable and entertaining).The four of us had a really enjoyable afternoon and we all certainly felt we got value for money.I believe it is wise to book well in advance ( we booked 3-4 weeks in advance) and we stayed for the whole 3.5 hours 11am to 2:30pm enjoying the view, food, drinks and conversation.I would definitely recommend the Equinox Sunday Brunch
5
Went for a birthday celebration on a Monday dinner. Staff is kind enough to help chill a cake brought from outside. Did not manage to get a window seat though. The ambience is really great. Really good for couples especially at night. Menu was given and service staff really know their food very well. They know everything. The ingredients, the cooking methods, the temperature.. Very precise. There was this lady, I suppose the manager, she knows that the older generation might prefer fully cookes salmon compared to what they usually serve maybe 90% cooked, she would ask my mum if she would orefer it fully cooked. Very thoughtful.Food was really great. Though the variety of food is not huge.
4
Views were. Best we had in Singapore ..high enough to see about everything incl Straits and multitude of ships at anchor..
Food and service were good not great and prices were quite high comparatively..but views are tough to best
4
Service excellent and there was a good variety of delicious food for high tea. Sitting at a table by the window on 69th floor was a lovely way to spend an hour or so on a beautiful Singapore afternoon.
4
Went to the bar not the restaurant. Atmospheric with low lighting and piano/singer. Beautiful view.
Even managed to witness a marriage proposal!
Cocktails expensive but delicious and unusual.
Dress code - no shorts!
4
We've dined here a few times and each time has been a great experience. Try to book a table by the window. If you time it well you will see the lights show in front of Marina Bay.
5
Can most definitely recommend this. The food was exquisite, the service is amazing and the view is sublime. What more can I say, thoroughly enjoyed the lunch and will most definitely be doing it again. Thank you so much.

This was my first time with 5 other friends having high-tea here. Past visits were usually in the evenings for New Asia Bar. We had opted for Equinox for its views and central location - both of which is the only good thing I can say about the place. The high tea commences from 3.30pm and closes by 5pm. It was rather strange to be kept in the 'holding' area on ground level by the hostess, who explained that the set-up wasn't ready yet. By 3.15pm a sizeable crowd had built-up and once the green light was given to go upstairs, it reminded me of the annual migration of Masai Mara. The views didn't disappoint, of course. Who would be able to move the landmarks surrounding the area? But the food and service were terribly disappointing. For the price and status of the place, I would expect a better quality spread. Instead, the food choices were cheap eats (fried spring rolls, fried potato samosas, egg sandwiches, Singapore Laksa WITHOUT prawns, prawn dumpling which tasted like it came out of a frozen pack). I walked by the sushi station thrice and couldn't get even a piece of salmon sushi. Replenishment was slow for the food. As for getting our cups of tea, it was a challenge. The waiter assigned to our area was rather strange, before an order could be completed, he'd walk away and just come back with one. I mean, for a table of 6, you don't take 2 orders and quickly walk away and neglecting the other 4. It was just really weird and bad service. When we first sat down, he asked us if we'd like a choice of the tea selection or coffee. I said coffee and asked for the options. His reply was 'coffee is just coffee'. Anyway, I was badly in need of a java jolt, so I bravely asked for it thinking black coffee can't go that wrong. Guess what? The brew was pure evil- it was sour which meant that it probably sat in the pot for a long time. There wasn't even a hint of aroma to the black brew, I gave up after two sips and asked for tea. Most high tea places would place a tea-pot with the guest, where we could pour our own tea and have it last a few cups. Not for Equinox, hence it was challenging to get our cups filled. The place was also extremely warm and we were perspiring as we ate; I noticed some tall fan coolers placed here and there. The table next to us gave feedback to the waiter about the lack of air-conditioning too, the waiter's reply took my breath away. He told the guest to complain direct to the Manager as he, a mere waiter, could do nothing. Oh my, Equinox, the training or rather lack of training of your staff is something you should seriously look into. Forget the 'nice' reviews written by some bloggers online, I can't fathom where THAT came from. I won't go back to Equinox again unless they clean up their act and prove me wrong. It's really a crying shame, given the excellent location and views. It could have been like The Peninsula of Hong Kong if they did a way better job

I visited this restaurant previously, admittedly many years ago and loved it so after a 3month touring holiday in Australia with friends and 4 day stopover in Singapore we wanted the last night of our holiday to be something special, unfortunately it wasn't, we were seated at possibly the worst table pushed in at the back, where the air conditioning couldn't reach, and it was a very humid evening. The staff were not particularly helpful although our waiter did offer to ask the manager if we could be moved after we had had our main courses, we were told that all the window tables were booked for a second sitting, but a 4 seater table on the raised dais was unoccupied all evening. We decided to leave and have dessert and coffee elsewhere, magically we were then told if we were prepared to wait while they cleared a table we could use it, we had already paid the bill and felt that we were being a nuisance so we left!Yes the view is magnificent and the food is excellent, but I do feel that the management need a course in customer relations. I would have preferred to have been told they were fully booked rather than being squeezed in at least I would still have lovely memories of the past occasions

Celebrated my wedding anniversary at the Equinox recently. My wife always wanted to try equinox. But I have read some not to fantastic review about them, so has not bothered to try them. One comment I always read is that tables were placed really closed to each other and there's no privacy. I agree in part. It really depends on the table you were allocated. Most tables for couples were placed pretty closed, some right beside the stairs where the buffet spread were placed. Those were really bad seats. We were lucky that we were given a window table right at the end, so it was pretty good in terms of privacy, traffic and view. The view from 70th floor is great. We went for the semi buffet lunch and I was pleasantly surprised by the buffet spread. It was really good starters, I enjoyed them more than the main course. Te main course was good, but I could fill my stomach just with the cold starters. The pastries were really nice too . Overall, we enjoyed ourselves. I like buffet, but to me the ambience is important. I dislike crowded restaurants and don't enjoy those no matter how great the buffet spread. Good day out
5
The food was excellent and the pricing was reasonable too. The staff were very attentive and friendly. The view was just stunning. Guests are allowed to take pictures while enjoying their dinner. Once it is dark outside people will start using their cameras and the flashlight, though have to admit that all other restaurant guests were very considerate and we didn't feel disturbed at all. In terms of food, I would definitely recommend the chateaubriand! It was superb
4
Recently dined here with my wife to celebrate our anniversary. We had a salad and smoked cream of tomato for starters, salmon and gnocchi for mains, chocolate fantasy and Madagascar vanilla mousse for desserts. The cream of tomato was awesome. It was fresh and tad tangy. The salmon was excellent and the presentation was palette pleasing. The gnocchi was nice too. The desserts were fantastically done and loved how the caramelised apple and apple chutney complimented the dessert. The ambience was nice. The tables were not close to each other and the staffs were very polite and meticulous. Service was promptly and commendable. 3 course dinner for two with mocktail and a bottle of still water costed $230. Definitely it's a high end place but for the food and view, the price is justified
5
Offers excellent buffet brunch with spectacular view. Unable to get a window seat as was reserved in advance. So call to make a reservation.
4
A very nice quality lunch - great variety with fish and cold cuts. The dessert very nice a view you will always remember. Great service
5
This is on the 77th floor of the Stamford Swissotel
It has a very good menu fantastic views and absolutely charming and professional wait staff
The food is superb and a bottle of Moët was on promotion at $88

My wife and I had high tea at this restaurant and were very happy with our overall experience. Yes, the spectacular view (from the 69th floor) can better the quality of the food, BUT the extensive spread - remember this is only a high tea - and the attentiveness of the staff more than compensate for this. No signs of any breaches of the 'smart-casual' dress-code. High tea is served from 15:30 until 17:00 so get there early and linger to enjoy a leisurely meal and take-in the view. DO NOT forget your camera

I made a reservation for a table for 2 at Equinox via a concierge service and the experience was seamless - a table booked at 8.15pm within 5 minutes. My guests and i were early and enjoyed the elevator ride (1 - 70 in less than 30 sec) which turned out to be the highlight of the night. The menu was quite limited for a 5 star hotel but maybe it was because Equinox was just 1 of a few restaurants within the property. We had half a dozen of oysters, which were quite small (all the more disappointing considering they cost S$48) and dry. We also ordered a lobster corn soup and a yellow tail Carpaccio which the staff happily thump all onto our table at the same time as they served the oysters. We had to gobble down the oysters quickly and even so, the soup was less than lukewarm when my guest had her first sip. The yellow tail was also average, max 6/10. Our main courses was a salmon and a tenderloin with onion rings. The salmon was so salty my guests finished less than her portion. The scallop accompanying the salmon was sweet but frugally sliced in half which makes it lose the bite of a good Japanese/Canadian scallop. My tenderloin was cooked to how i ordered (medium) which was good. The cut was delicious and easy to my knife. But the bone marrow was horribly buttered and really oily with minimal taste to it. I choose Onion Rings as my side dish and the presentation of these LARGE battered rings were WOW but they are as oily as any fried bread you can find. Disappointed, my guest and i didn't even consider ordering dessert and left right after we put down our knives. To top it all up, we went to the adjacent mall and had some marvelous dessert for less than 10% what the dinner would have costed

I will put here the mail I sent to Swissotel about my experience at high tea Equinox:I'm writing this email to let you know about my very disappointing experience last Saturday 3.5.2014 at Equinox for the afternoon high tea.I'm a Swiss citizen and live in Singapore since almost 9 years. I used to go to the high tea at Equinox and over places like Jaan (I'm going there tomorrow btw) and over restaurants in Singapore including other high tea events in the city. Equinox high tea was a pleasant place and I liked the food and ambiance.However, this last Saturday was a disaster and I don't know what is happening but the standard, food and ambiance is not the same at all:- High tea is a place to enjoy and I remember (if I'm not wrong) that the dress code was more strict than what I saw this last Saturday: People in short, sleepers, dress code you can see when you go to a food court, etc.... really pathetic- Food variety is not there anymore and quality definitively is going down- Had to remind the staff many times about getting plates that were missing, twice about the orange juice and other juices not refilled- Staff is not attentive enough when things on the buffet getting low and replacement not done on timeDefinitively, the high tea at Equinox is not a high standard anymore and this is not the first time I heard the bad review from friends. I wanted to see by myself and I'm convinced of it now. I won't come again as I'm not willing to go to a place where people are not dressed for the circumstance and the food and service standard is not reaching the hotel brand.Swissotel is a brand and the word Swiss means quality. As I told you before, as a Swiss Citizen, I'm really disappointed by the high tea at Equinox and my last experience was really not a good one.Hope this mail will go to the appropriate manager(s).Thank you and best regardsThis is not the place I will go anymore ...

View was jaw dropping...Mini buffet for appetizer and dessert were mouth watering.Main course was so good that hubby and I were so impressed. Order wagyu and salmon, the presentation and cooking style were good, impressive and yummy.Definitely worth the money even though it was a pricey lunch ;
3
My husband & I dined at this restaurant. The view from this location is spectacular & unbeatable. Service was excellent, our food was delivered to us in an unhurried manor allowing us maximum time to savor & enjoy our meal. The reason for only average rating is that this is a fine dining restaurant so expectations are high. The beet salad & the crab cakes were very good. We ordered 1/2 dozen fresh oysters. They were lovely, delicious & fresh but hadn't been properly shucked so we had to struggle to release the oyster from the shell. The roasted salmon was to come with scallops but what I received was clearly one scallop cut in half so that two thin pieces were on my plate, most disappointing to say the least. The snapper was a very small portion, heavy on appearance and could have been matched by a skilled home chef. Chocolate Souffle was good, not outstanding. Apple Pie was deconstructed, sugar garnish was burnt
4
Singapore isn't a cheap place to drink. The Equinox Bar on Level 70 has a regular offer of S$88++ for a bottle of Moet et Chandon (Rose is also available but is more expensive) and the accompanying snacks keep getting replenished. There's also a decent selection of food to order from the bar menu, including some yummy satay sticks. The view, especially as the sun goes down and the lights come on, is pretty sensational but be warned - it costs more to sit next to the window, so unless you're desperate for a 'front row' seat, just take one of the comfy spots a little further back and relax
2
My friend and I wanted to go somewhere special for our last night in Singapore so decided to go to Equinox, but were left very disappointed by the service.I ordered the smoked salmon, followed by the black cod with a side of vegetables. The salmon arrived which ok. When my main arrived it came with nothing that was on the menu - it said it was served with horseradish which it did not so i requested it. My side vegetable didn't arrived so i politely asked the waiter. After serving another table he went to the kitchen and about 15 minutes later they arrived with the horseradish with no apology.The cod was average, which is disappointing considering it is Â£50. For desserts I asked for some fruit as I saw fruit accompanied many other desserts on the menu. The waiter quickly said no you can't have that as it's not on the menu. Although that is completely understanding it would have been nice if he was polite about it.We were left waiting for about 45 minutes before anyone came and saw us, and another half an hour after requesting the bill.The views are amazing, however I would definitely not go back
5
Its a real experience at the 69th floor. The views are just stunning.... The food and the staff were good.
5
Had an awesome lunch with some friends, this is an iconic location with the best view in Singapore, the service was spot on and the food great. Highly suggest this as a lunch or dinner location given the view and overall ambience.
5
What an amazing location and what an amazing view; plus excellent service and superb food. Not the cheapest, although it was worth every dollar. The total experience and overall quality makes this place one of my two favourite restaurants in the world.
4
Restaurant had nice views. Food was OK, but you're really paying for the views. If you want to see these suggest you go to the nearby bar on the same floor. Great views but less expensive.
5
Good place for business lunch with visitors. The spread on the buffet is huge, dont go there if you are on a diet. Not cheap but not ridiculous price either.
3
The Equinox Bar has, to use my dear mother's favourite phrase, "lost its bloom." It once was cool and "ooh-aahhh" worthy back in 2005 but now it's rather tired. The soft furniture is stained and tatty - at least this was revealed when the swirling spotlights hit it. The old array of decorative Moët bottles were dusty and the service, distinctly lacking. The waiter was more interested in his phone and socialising than in providing good service here. I had to ask if there were nuts or crackers served with drinks and he brought along a bowl of bhuja crackers with his thumb planted in the middle of it. A disappointment. Reason to go: it's a nite-club after 9 although the music before 9 was a thumping selection of weird Michael Jackson remixes...; and you can get a glass of wine for only $13 (instead of $25!!!) in happy hour. That goes from 5 until 9 but not all drinks have happy hour prices so give them a call before you go. Happy Hour is why I was there after a long day at a conference. That and the gorgeous view... Beware, you will not see much of the Marina Bay view here ( the MBS was built long after the hotel was established so the focus is on the quays) but the view of the city skyline is spectacular. You will see the Marina Bay area well from the restaurants which are at the other end of the complex literally and figuratively. If you're up for a minimum $200 each for dinner price, go ahead and make a reservation. Prices in this town are out of control!
5
This must be truly one of the best restaurants i have been so far.The ambience takes time to sink in as you get mesmerized by the brethtaking views from the restaurant located at the 70th level of the Swissotel hotel.Perhaps the best views of Singapore city can be viewed from this complex.The dinner to was a treat.Some of the best European food to tantalize your taste buds.The presentation, service and taste was simply superb.A must visit place if in singapore
5
This has yet been another wonderful day with a visit to the Equinox for their champaign brunch. We brought friends over and they just thought it was one of the best brunches, all on the top of the world, great! End month is the Pink Buffet which serves pink Moet. It was lovely, the ushers were in pink, pink balloons and it was a fun atmoshphere. There were kids at the restaurant and I think they had a good time. Pink Panther came to visit and that was good fun too. Food - excellent, my glass was never empty and the champaign, Pink Moet - wonderful. The 2 piece band, as always - great. The only thing is that you may have to change the fish wellington. Its different, I understand but not many people seem to want to try that. The chef has a little work ahead of him. But still outstanding. We will be back for more
5
High tea, in every sense of the word, was spent one Saturday afternoon at the top of the world! We were ushered to a window table by the hospitable service staff. The view proved to be one of the highlights of a delightful afternoon. The other highlight was the high tea spread, a mix of eastern and western dishes. A sumptuous line-up of chicken porridge, Singapore laksa, assorted sushi, tuna croissants, chicken sausage, among others; delighted the tastebuds.Norliza, who greeted us at the entrance, came by to inquire how we were doing and did an excellent job of ensuring our needs were met. What a star! The same goes for Samuel, who seemed to be in charge of the section we were seated in.I usually do not go for high tea often, but if I was asked where I would recommend, the answer is quite obvious
5
This restaurant has the best creme brulée ever. Apart from its generosity, the smooth and sleek vanilla custard is one I would have again and again. I'ce been there à des times, The meals were all excellent and there's no single experience I remember that is ever disappointing. Great view, great place for business lunch or dinner for overseas guests in singapore. The price is what you have to pay for all that
5
Superb venue in a stunning location. Excellent restaurant on the 69th floor with views across the Marina Bay. Discreet staff and varied menu served superbly with wine choices to match. Would recommend to anyone.
3
The view from equinox is really beautiful, specially at dinner..... but the food is not very good, and the staff are not very kind..... i think the management have got to retrain the staff for better guest relations...... very disappointing.......
5
A lot of the food here is really at a very very high quality and fresh fresh. Amazing view of singapore too!
2
Amazing view of Singapore, good food ..but the wine list was extraordinarily expensive even by Singapore standards ( limited creativity frankly about the wine selection , not much choice below 150 Sing dollars ) . But what I found absolutely puzzling was the service and the whole organization in that restaurant. Sometimes, you have bad service..here we got No Service at all..had to literally ask for water, then wine, were left on our own waiting..the reservation was at 20:30 ..our main course arrived at 22:45 ! And this was a steak and a piece of cod . We left exhausted past midnight ..surrounded by waiters cleaning the room.Steep bill as well over 200 dollars per head
5
Quite disappointed didn't get to have a table at Club Asia After booking in advance ( 1 week in advance) .. but Equinox truly delivered a sensational gastronomical experience for me, my partner and his brother who is a local!! I can recommend Equinox for its fabulous main menu and I truly gave 10 out of 10 for the dessert created in perfection and tasted devine ... thank you chef :)
5
We really enjoyed our high tea at the Equinox. We left our reservations until the day before we were leaving and many other better known high tea destinations were already reserved. The staff was fantastic - very attentive and efficient. The tea was fabulous! And the view was exceptional. Again, we reserved too late to reserve a window seat but were able to move to a vacant one when we were there. The food was lovely. It is a buffet, but there was a wide selection of food to satisfy all of our group - from the very conservative to the more adventurous. In terms of value for money, we had had the buffet lunch at our restaurant for the same price the day before and it simply did not compare to the Equinox
4
Food is reasonable. Wine list impressive. Locatedon Lvl 57, the view is superb and you pay for that. If you have lots of spare cash (say SGD300++), sure go for it. I won't be returning though. Once is enough for me. Overall, nice food and very nice view but very pricey

A few of the best French fine dining experiences that I have had have actually been outside France but still in Europe. This was the first time in Asia. A very good thing was the set menus with the accompanying wines, but unfortunately you still had a few choices to make for the supplements, blindly without knowing the price, which the restaurant took advantage of (a practice unfortunately not unknown of in France). The bill ended up at a price at which you would have expected more than the original in France. The view was fantastic and the dining hall aesthetically simple. Unfortunately the dining experience was ruined by the neighbouring table’s Indonesian beauty queen who spoke so loudly vulgar that Gloria in Modern Family seems more soft-spoken than princess Diana in a BBC interview. For that the restaurant cannot be blamed. Or maybe this kind of crowd is inevitable in Asian luxury restaurant
5
Had the champagne brunch on the weekend. Wide spread of seafood on ice, hot carving station, dessert and wide range on alcohol for you to select from Moët & Chandon, selection of wines, beer, hard liquor, cocktails, juices, soft drinks etc. yes I enjoy with the service, my champagne was constantly refilled. My dirty plates was cleared instantly. Service was fast and efficient. The view was spectacular.

This restaurant has barely anything to stand on other than the fact that it's got a good view. But you can get a good view at a lot of other places too! What was most appalling at this place was that the service was non-existent e.g. wine bottles and water were placed on a separate table away from us and no one at all came to refill our empty glasses at any time. After several times of getting the attention of the staff and asking them to refill our glasses, we finally gave up and went to the table to get the bottles ourselves. There were several other poor services which would make this review too lengthy if each were listed! Also, the food didn't quite redeem the place as it was fairly average for the price. Suffice to say, this place should be avoided and must be avoided if it is intended for a business purpose or for a romantic purpose - not sure any client or your other half will be left with a good impression of you if they were brought to a place like this
5
We arrived to Equinox for their high tea experience. The view from their 57th story, the food and the light family atmosphere made me enjoy every moment there.With the price for 2 being being a total of 100SGD (with taxes and service charge), this was very reasonable prices dining considering the view and service being excellent
5
Had my wedding anniversary dinner here recently and reserved a nice table by the window for $20++ more. The service was excellent and prompt throughout. Lovely waiters who had a great understanding of the menu and service staff who more than obliged to take photos and recommend poses for us.The wine list (per glass selection) is also surprisingly good and when i wanted to order a second glass to take with my steak, the waiter immediately came up with a recommendation that turned out to be fantastic pairing. Kudos to him. We ordered crab cakes and lobster bisque to start, followed by kurobuta pork belly and a tenderloin for mains and chocolate souffle to round things up. All the food was prepared to the highest of standards although I would have to say that apart from the souffle, all the other dishes could come warmer or on heated plates so they can retain their freshness for longer.Overall had a great time and would definitely return again

weekend afternoon hi-tea is only available from 3.30pm to 5pm. with the time limit, it certainly is not a place for a relaxing afternoon tea session. food spread & quality is acceptable. this place is certainly worth a visit if your priority is phototaking amidst the panoramic view, and not the food or a nice chill out place.Place was rather hot & stuffy on day of visit, although it was a cloudy afternoon with slight drizzle
4
Was amazing views and such hospitable staff, although there was a function there that night & the main meal took 1.5 hours to get to us. Also the one thing on the menu I wanted to order, they were not serving that night as didnt have the ingredient. The food didnt blow us away either

This is getting to be one of my favorite places for champaign brunch. Lovely buffet spread, not too large, not too crowded and love the intimate way the tables are placed.I went there with my partner a few weeks ago and loved it. We brought some friends and guest on Sunday and they loved it too. Brunch starts at 11am and ends at 2:30pm. The 2-piece band were great. Great singer - a great duo! The roving magician was a nice touch. We then proceeded to city space, which is on the same floor to continue our Moet pleasure.We definitely will be back soon

This restaurant is all about the view, which certainly won't disappoint. The food is pretty good too but not in the Michelin star category. Definitely have the Foie Gras if you like it - a delicious combination of flavours, but give the steak tartare a miss if you are European or American as it's done with an Asian style sauce that seems odd with this essentially French dish.The service is just good enough for somewhere so expensive, but they could go the extra mile, perhaps the occasional smile, and less than a 20 minute wait for the bill would help the financial pain.Visit once but I won't be returning as I don't think the cost is worth it

On an impulse, we decided to try Equinox for the expected view, and had heard food was good. We arrove at 7.45, to be told we could not get a table before 9. We begrudgingly accepted this wait and went to the bar. At 8pm, we were told a table was ready, great ! As we walked through the Restuarant however to our table, we saw the restaurant was half empty. Tables available everywhere. Sure every window seat was taken, but, while that would have been nice, it was not a reason to have potentially put us off dining by making us wait to 9. Was this some sort of setting up exclusivity ? Bet the owner would not be impressed to hear reception was potentially turning custom away.Anyway, we go a table with a moderate view, ordered, and before mains arrove, a window table became available and the very nice waiter happily moved us to the significantly better view by the window. Absolutely breathtaking. We ordered the Chateaubriand and it was perfection.Pricey, yes, but worth it if you can justify. A unique experience.If it wasn't for the odd reception process, I'd give this a top score

On 30 December, my family members were having dinner at Equinox Restaurant.1. It is the highest restaurant in Singapore. We believe everyone shares the same feedback as us - The view is stunning, food is fantastic, the setting of the dining area was 1st class. Most important are the staff who always amazing with the standard of service. So our review here will mentions few names that made a differ - 2. Thank to the arrangement by Daniel Quek, Assistant Director of Food & Beverage, Fairmont, Singapore. We appreciate his honest and willingness to ensure our new year ends with a positive experience. Fairmont are fortunate to have him in charge of F&B sector, as he always ensure every customer will have a good memory. 3. Anthony Yeo, Assistant Food & Beverage Manager who visits my family member and ensures everything went well. Did he need to do that? No I think, but he take the effort to ensure everything go well for my family. He worth to be mention as he the one who settle 7 Dec 13 dinner issue too. Because of him, all our 50++ Guests got a good celebration at SzeChuan Court.  4. Desiderio Bevilacqua, Assistant Manager, Equinox Complex. Thank for the recommendation on the menu. My family was overwhelmed with every aspect of service that he provided. From the start of the dinner through the time they leave. 5. Sansan, the Waitress, who serve my family for almost 4hours. She takes pride to introduce us to the places. It never been easily to stand there for such a long hour, Sansan got a great passion and she made sure every single detail are look into.She maybe just a waitress, but she the one who wants every guest to have an enjoyable evening. Her organizational and serving skills were great, it can be seen from the way food, wine was present. She gave my family all of the attention that they needed and her attention to detail was evident when she able to spot the little need that my girls want. Thank Sansan for taking first rate care of my family on 30 Dec 13 and for her outstanding service, Fairmont should know this - she had performed to ensure that this restaurant will remain a big name to everyone who visit.It is an amazing experience, the great menu with unique view & comprehensive wine list. It is a wonderful high-class restaurant and hardworking staff that deserves to be recommending to local and overseas guests

Equinoxe had all the glam - views and ambience combined with great service. The food was very good but not in the top category (Michelin worthy) I have eaten in places like Paris, Sydney and California. One positive was how well the staff handled my 6yo daughter - friendly and inclusive unlike some other high end places. Well done to the Equinoxe floor staff
5
I have dined at Equinox easily more than 10 times. I am a huge fan!As a Singaporean, I feel blessed that the restaurant is just a few minutes away from me. The view is always stunning, the staff always amazing with the standard of service, and of course, the food is fantastic. Some staff even remember me when they see me, and although not necessary, it feels great to be recognized.The price goes with any top-end Michelin-starred fine dine spots around the globe and it's not for everyone. One thing though, it is definitely a place worth proposing to your partner at! I did not, but I would if I had to do it again.I suggest you make reservation at around 6.30pm. You will get to see the amazing view of the city in the daytime, and then catch the sunset, and the lovely city lights when it gets dark after.The window seating is chargeable at $20 on top of the total bill - If the occasion fits, why not? Considering you would want to be there for at least an hour.Photography tips there: When taking shots of the city view, turn your flash off. When taking portraits, turn it on, but prior to that, set the exposure so that the city lights are at its brightest. The staff are incredible with framing shots off a heavy DSLR too, so do not hesitate to ask for their help with your couple/group shots

Booked for meal with window seat(a must) food was great rib of beef would have fed 4 people view is fantastic but allow $500 if ur having wine for 2

Becoming a "must-see" place is generally very difficult, even more so in Singapore where there is so much competition. Equinox is undoubdtely one of them. Let's go straight to the point: if you aksed me whether the food here is worth the money, my answer would be "No"; if you asked me whether the whole experience it is, the answer is "absolutely yes". The view is absolutely breathtaking, stunning. Hence, first tip: BOOK A TABLE BY THE WINDOW!. Don't mind the 20$ extra required, they are absolutely worth it. The service is top notch in terms of professionality, care for customers is incredibly good, they really let you feel at the centre of their attentions. The atmosphere is intimate and romantic despite the place being really big with high ceilings. The food is very good, plates' presentation was also well looked after and the menu is reasonably large to caters for differen tastes. However, as I said before, it is extremely expensive and not worth the money if you only value the food experience. It will be difficult to leave this place with a bill below 400$SGD. Overall, a Must-See place, a stunning experience in one of the coolest restaurant in the world

My date and I had the seafood platter for two and shared a steak from the fine cut menu. Both were excellent, they better be, at the price which including a bottle of wine (Tekoko Cloudy Bay 2010 - excellent!) and desserts worked out to SGD550. The staff was kind enough to move us to a window table, which despite the SGD20 charge, was well worth it. My only gripe concerns the level of staff proficiency. Whilst polite, it seemed quite OTT and 'rushed' i.e. trying too hard, and looking too worried, and speaking not so good English way too quickly. Not pro at all. James Bond would have been miffed. I couldn't get a straight, comfortable answer to quite a number of questions on the food, reservations for New Asia bar i.e. I offered to pre-purchase two bottles of Moet (about SGD400) so that cover charge could be waived for another couple (SGD50) I invited over, the answer was a 'no' after quite a bit of consultations, going on around me, much to our chagrin. They seemed new to the job and trying too obviously to act on instructions rather than experience. It was quite funny, in a sad way and a real let down considering the service levels in the Singapore retail sectors are often top notch. Besides the staff histronics, the place itself is one of a kind, offering an unparallel view of the Marina and Singapore skyline
5
We were only in Singapore for one night and after a bit of research online, we decided to go with Equinox which is located in the Swisshotel. We found the decor to be somewhat dated but that wasn't deal breaker. The view is breathtaking! Very James Bond like feeling, really has the wow factor. We both ordered steaks from the fine cut menu which both came with two sides and a sauce, and we also had a dessert to share. Steaks were delicious and so was the dessert. Presentation was fab too. My other half had a beer and we had a bottle of wine to share. The bill came to around $320 SGD which of course is expensive, but in our view, worth every penny. Service was spot on, attentive but not OTT. It is also worth noting that it is an extra $20 to have a window table but again we considered it worth it! Highly recommend :

Stopped in here as we were looking for a place with a view. Wonderful sunset over the town, great harbor lights later. Service was really friendly and efficient, very helpful suggestions. Equinox had a special on grass-fed beef which was truly excellent! We tried two different tournedos and it was great to taste the difference. Well done
1
Me and my colleagues, we have been there several times. The staff needs to be informed more. They did not seem to know what are the rules for example, if there is a dress code for the restaurant or not. It is inconsistant. At times, they allowed guests using slippers or even shorts to have lunch there which I think isnÂ´t appropriate, especially when the rest were decently dressed. There was once we were been told by one of the girls serving, that there was no dress code for lunch, so which is which? Dress code or no dress code? It is a pity because the restaurant has a wonderful view over Marina Bay Sands and the others The standard of the food has droppe
5
My dining pleasure was enhanced by waiter like Aaron. He knows the menu very well and he made the right recommendations. He suggested that we ordered the roast beef rib that comes with garlic spinach and potato wedges. He told us to watch out for the wedges as they are mouthwatering. Next he recommended us the right wine to pair with the meal. Dining pleasure here = good service + quality food + spectacular view. Good restaurant for a romantic dinner or to entertain overseas friends. But the prices are on high side
2
It could be good to someone who is having their first high tea experience for the spectacular view. Apart from that, there's a lot improvement needed to meet the rating. 1. 1 n half hour is too short 2. The choices of food is less impressive, n that apply to their dessert 3. The quality of food is below average ( as with price i can get much better food quality at shanga ri la hotel) Staff r ok but i do hope they do pay attention with

After doing a heap of research to find the best venue for Christmas lunch with friends, I decided on Eqinox. The four of us found the whole day wonderful. Good value for money with "free-flow" champagne and wine. Entertainment was enjoyable and varied with balloon artists, choirs and Santa. The selection of food on offer was well presented and delicious. The dessert buffet incredible. To top this off the view over Singapore from the top of the Swissotel was just beautiful
5
If you love seafood then this brunch is for you. That's not to say that if, like me, you are probably going to pass on the scallops and oysters, that you should go elsewhere! This is a stunning brunch - maybe not as expansive as The Hyatt for instance which seems to have half of Singapore filled with food, but there is plenty of amazing quality, delicious food to keep you happy for the three or so hours that brunch will take, and you will not be able to sample it all. Keep space for the dessert area too!Added to the wonderful food and the constant top up of champagne - should you choose that option - are the fabulous views over Singapore and down to The Padang (Singapore Cricket Club). Book early to get a window table. I have been to this restaurant before but this time had the added excitement of being able to see the Marina a Bay Race Track (Grand Prix). The Equinox is somewhere I will always want to re-visit
4
When booking, ask for a table by the window because views from this restaurant is the best so far. Ordered a scallop baked in a shell with a slice of onion. Very fresh and tasty. Main: barramundi very nice combination of tastes in the dish although if you are a man it might not be enough because the dish is small. Was enough for me and i did enjoy it. I am not a fun of lobsters but it was great with souse. The only downside I think is they are a bit understaffed. Good service but one girl is taking care of about 7 tables is not enough, although she was very attentive, trying to please everyone. Great experience overall
5
We celebrated a 60th birthday at Equinox on 14/09/2013 and were not disappointed. The menu selection is not overly large (rather surprisingly) however the quality and presentation of the food could not be faulted. The views over Singapore are sensational and that alone makes this restaurant a stand-out. The service is also excellent
4
Its on the 70th Floor... so unless its raining out or the haze comes back, you're treated to a great view (reserve early to get a window seat!).I went for LUNCH. 12noon - 2.30pm (come on time to maximise your eating time)The semi-buffet is for the Entrée/Starter & Desert, the main you choose from a short list. AVOID the Pork Belly unless artery clogging fats are your desire. Besides the skin was not crisp and crunchy.The best main was the beef. Although the fish was ok too (ours was tiny bit over cooked which was probably a process problem as I think it was ready to go too early and sat under cover, above hot herb soup, which also softened the skin - I expected the skin to be crisp & crunchy but it was not)For starters/entrée, expect Sushi selection, Salmon & Tuna sashimi, cold cooked prawns, crabs, mussels, clams, raw oysters... DIY salad bar, decent bread, unsalted butter and a selection of spreads, 2 soups, a small selection of cold cuts.For desert - A small selection of ice creams & sorbets (good to excellent), chocolate fountain, cheese platter with a variety of crackers, figs, apricots, nuts as well as a small range of cakes and other pastryIf you can get a discount (search for it), its really worth it..

This is a very pretty restaurant with an incredible view of Singapore. I like that you are not sitting cheek by jowl with other patrons. The noise level was low and fine for pleasant conversation. I hesitated to go based on the reviews of the food but was glad I did. Certainly, there are more innovative and thought-provoking kitchens in Singapore but this offers, for the most part, quite decently prepared cuisine that the global affluent will recognize. The good: they are better with appetizers - the house-cured salmon is amazing and a large portion of meltingly rich tuna tartare came with tiny cubes of gelled soy sauce and little daubes of apple, avocado, etc. The bread is very nice, with tiny baguettes and olive brioche. We didn't order it but there was a special on Moet & Chandon for 85S$. The wine list is good and expensive. The could be better: the service is just ok; our waiter was informed and pleasant but sometimes hard to find on a not terribly crowded evening. At this level, I'm used to waitstaff who intuit what I need a millisecond before I realize it myself. Main courses were a little off on temperature and fish was somewhat overcooked. The butter, which is flavored and comes in long rectangles that look like cuisenaire rods seems like it is frozen first, which would be fine except the taste is a little freezer-burned. Dinner for two included 3 appetizers and a main course, 2 Guinnesses and 2 glasses of wine plus a seat by the window; it came to $315 S or about $250 US. This is a place I would take clients or my visiting parents rather than people with very adventurous palates
5
Booking taken by pleasant lady who nicely pre-warned us all tables by the windows we taken.Given a nice table in the second tier but next to a couple where the man needed to shout at his partner. We asked to move and were given a table even further back but higher up so still a nice view.However, from this point out new waiter was just awesome. Serving food and drink is not really rocket science but doing it well with style and grace seems to be beyond most waiters.Friendly but not over familiar again is what I like from a 5 star set up and this guy was just that.OH and the food and wine was superb, the kind that makes you forget it was actually top dollar . We will be bac

It's the time of the year again to splurge on a celebratory birthday dinner for wife! Thankfully her birthday is just once a year :-) Had originally wanted to go to the ever popular French restaurant , Jaan, but as a result of procrastinating, a reservation call made 3 days earlier failed to secure a table for two. I had to settle for Equinox instead, located within the same Hotel. It turned out much better than I had expected. Incidentally, it was at this very same restaurant ( was called Compass Rose then) 14 years ago where I had proposed to my wife (then girlfriend) with a diamond ring. The rest, as they say, is history. :-)At 70th floor, Equinox boasts of a paranomic view of the Marina Bay and the CBD which is hard to beat. Restaurant ambience is nice and dim, which adds to the romantic feel. Bread basket was served together with a selection of butter and sea salt arranged elegantly on a dark marble plate. We chose the tasting menu which consists of 2 appetizers, 2 entrees and a dessert. The food quality was good, both my wife and I particularly enjoyed the 2 entrees consisting of barramundi and beef tenderloin fillet. We liked the plating and presentation of all the 5 dishes. The service was mostly good, we had no complaints. Bill came up to $400 after add ons such as a flute of Moët Chandon Champagne and coffee / tea which was not included in the tasting menu. Petit fours was served towards the end of the dinner. We intend to come back again in future for an enjoyable meal. Cheers.Tips: come early before 7 pm to appreciate the Singapore skyline in daylight and witness the transformation into the night scenic skyline which is even more awesome. Make reservation early to get the window seats
4
We had dinner at Equinox on the day of our arrival at Singapore. We had a 1 night stop and wanted to explore the city from high. We opted for Equinox even if the reviews were not enthusiastic about food. Indeed, food selection was not so that nice: a fake sophisticated menu with mediocre portions. But the location is great with one of the best views of Singapore!Go there for sunset and remember to bring with you a scarf or a sweater: the air-con is terrible
5
We had the tasting menu with a window seat booked for 6:30pm to see the sun set. Whilst we didn't actually see the sun set as were were facing the wrong way (facing Marina Sands Bay), the views were amazing and as the sun set and the lights came on it was an amazing experience. The food on the tasting menu was delicious, we also had the wine pairing and this added to the experience. This restaurant was definitely the highlight of our trip to Singapore
4
This is a fine dining expensive restaurant.The portion sizes were on the small size (i had to fill up with bread even though i ordered the five course tasting menu). The food was good though but not exceptional. Good wine list and service attentive although they took an age to deliver the wine we ordered as this had to be brought from not sure where. The restaurant itself needs updating and refurbishing as its a little dated. The main reason you go here though is for the incredible views. Make sure you arrive before sunset and get almost panoramic views of Singapore.
3
The view from Equinox is surely one of the best in Singapore. On a clear sky day, one can see the Marina Bay Sands, Singapore River, Singapore Flyer and the Gardens by the Bay. The high tea is nothing to shout about. They serve TWG tea. Scones were not bad. A spread of asian, western dishes and cold cuts. There is a chocolate fondue section. Dessert is average. Service is good but I think it's understaff. $48+++ per pax
3
Though food and service are reasonable, and the "favorites" do not get retained on the menu, the incredible view of Singapore makes up for any other misses.
4
Service was attentive, food was good as was the selection and they had a supervised play area for kids. Stunning views as you can expect at this location. Planning a return visit soon.
4
I had a work dinner here. The food was excellent and the venue outstanding, although the serving sizes were a little small (I do not appreciate huge helpings, especially for fine dinning, but there is a limit on the small size too).
5
We love this place for Sunday brunch. We go once a month and really enjoy the free flowing champers and excellent food on offer. They also have a kids area where they have someone to look after the kids and have things like Nintendo Wii etc. Also food there for the kids like slider burgers and other small foods.We have been for special occasions as well and even for Christmas lunch in 2012.Excellent service, excellent food and great atmosphere and the views, well, they are one of the best in Singapore
4
We went for an after theatre dinner and ordered only main course and dessert. Our main courses were well cooked and presented. The dessert, on the other hand had pieces of puff pastry that tasted stale with the taste of oil on them. Service was inconsistent as well. While our Filipino waitress was extremely friendly and attentive, the same could not be said of the lead waitress who lead us to our table with a grouch that remain on her face throughout our stay there. I found the pricing there a little too high for the standard of food served and the service. Perhaps they are putting a high premium on the view which is great if you are there at night and have not seen it before.
4
Great view, ask for a window seat to enjoy the view while at brunch!For the champagne brunch, the food was good, not too much selection though.Thought that the drinks top-up could have been better, we had to keep asking for top ups and orders. Overall, if you are looking for a great venue for that special occasion brunch, this is it :
4
My two sons and I dined here on our stopover night on the way to NZ. We booked well ahead, and so got a great table by the window. The building is one of the tallest in Singapore, so you really feel you're looking down on the city.The welcome was fantastic - greeted by name without having opened our mouths. The service was attentive, but not intrusive throughout the meal. The food itself was excellent, though the portions for the mains could have been a little larger. As stated in the title the prices were quite steep - dinner for the three of us cost $450, and we didn't even have the more expensive dishes. The dishes on the menu are imaginative without being outlandish (as sometimes happens), and the Assiette de Desserts was excellent.All in all, an excellent experience, and just right for a special occasion
5
Was at brunch at Equinox again yesterday and, once more, it delivered in every aspect - food, service and (of course) the view. The selection is amazing and the champagne kept flowing. There are many brunches on the island but I think the one at Equinox is hard to beat
5
This was the most expensive meal we have ever had, but also the best meal we had ever had. Paid an extra $20 for a table at the window, but when you are on 70th floor of a hotel in Singapore, you might as well splash out. Amazing view, absolutely incredible food and wonderful service. Staff were attentive without being intrusive. We could see the light show from the Marina Bay Sands hotel over the bay, while simultaneously watching a game of Rugby 7's at the stadium below (through the zoom on hubby's camera). Had a few cocktails in funky side leaning glasses. The chef's choice, dessert platter was to die for. Cannot say enough good things about this place. Very high class, without feeling pretentious. Love, love love it!
4
I don't have much experience in the fine-dining sector of the food industry, but this restaurant provided a great first-time encounter. We were blown away upon stepping out of the lift with the glittering lights of the magnificent city skyline of Singapore. The food itself would stick with me for a very long time - rich, delicate, indulging. Props to the first-class chefs for their exquisite culinary direction. It just made the whole experience so much more enjoyable. All in all, Equinox deserves its status as a top-quality restaurant and the dining itself is something everyone should give a shot at
4
We enjoyed our drinks and food - high quality food and service which made our trip worth visiting this place.
5
Great service from Kaspar, he's a credit to your organisation!
Food was great and we never had an empty glass to thanks to Kaspar.
Definitely worth the money!
4
The first thing you notice at Equinox is not its food. It's the beautiful view at 69 floors high, that overlooks Singaporeâ€™s CBD and all over Marina Bay. Overall, it's a good experience with such an idyllic setting, view, service and spread. Everyone should dine at least once up there! This would be the idea choice for a special occasion. You can read more on my blog at, http://www.jacqsowhat.blogspot.sg/2013/06/swissotel-equinox-restaurant-high-tea.htmlThanks! 
5
Equinox is a fantastic restaurant. The views are incredible from the 70th floor. The atmosphere is great. The starter, main course and desert were great. There is a nice selection of wine. I go to Equinox everytime I visit Singapore because the tasty food and the lovely views are just incredible
4
This hotel has an excellent buffet and is good value for money considering the views of Marina bay sands, esplanade, merlion, River quay, Clarke quay, Gardens by the bay etc etc.. whatever you can think about in Singapore. There are less vegetarian options, but whatever is available is good.
4
Had a lovely lunch with the ladies at Equinox. Even though it was a little hazy, it was worth going there for the amazing view. The food was an unlimited lunch buffet starter, a table d'hote main, and a buffet sweet choice with selection of cheeses. $77 includes a glass of wine and if you pay by Mastercard you get a 20% discount. The food was very nice and my only complaint would be that the staff were very keen on clearing everything away to make way for the next sitting. We were talking so much that we nearly missed the desserts altogether. Nicer presentation of the tea and coffee is needed. I would recommend Equinox and will definitely go again
4
I first had dinner there. It was an unplanned family dinner. I could say the dinner menu could have a bit more choices on it as it was quite limited. I understand being a fine dining restaurant there usually isn't much options. Despite the portions being small, the presentation of the dishes and of course the taste was quite decent if you are paying for that amount. The gnocchi main course was one of the best gnocchi I have tasted, could be more generous of the good tasting goat cheese sauce. The dessert menu, was so tempting to have more than just one. So do try the Grand Assiette of Desserts. Its a long plate with a bit of everything. Good recommendation and upselling by the manager. On that whole plate, nothing too overpowering with sweetness, it was balanced with some sour tastes too. Not those dessert plates that makes you worry of getting diabetes after the meal. Also, of course to get a table by the window to enjoy the view will cost you a little extra. The manager gives good service and customer care however, the associates could be a little bit more attentive to the guests sitting the corner (sometimes I wonder if it was the restaurant being too dark or they were just understaffed). Worth trying the high tea for a better picture of the view! Although try not to go when it's too late because food on the buffet tends to run out, especially on the savoury side. The service during dinner was definitely much better during the high tea session
4
The Semi-Buffet Lunch on the weekends at Equinox, entitles you to a selection of any one of ten main courses, of which I would recommend the rugged tenderloin or the barramundi stewed in herb broth. Added to that is a lovely spread of appetisers, cold seafood, salads, soups, cheese, sushi, sashimi and desserts, buffet style.Particularly enticing in the buffet spread were the cold sri lankan crabs and oysters from the seafood bar, the tuna sashimi from the japanese bar, the cheese, and the macaroons and chocolate fondue from the dessert bar.Would definitely make a repeat visit
2
The panoramic view is amazing, especially if you have the opportunity to be close to the windows.But the food is very disappointing. We paid almost 500S$ for 2 persons, and there was nothing special that you could not do at homeSome good products but not well prepared and the quantities served are very limited. Could have been honest for 100S$, including the wine.The wine and service were correct.We have been in many restaurants in Singapore, with budget from 40 to 600 S$. It was probably the place where we had the worst dinner.Go there just to have a look or have a drink, not to eat
3
We went to this restaurant for dinner on Thursday last week. We had not made any reservation in advance and were pleasantly surprised that we could have a table. The view from the restaurant was stunning. The restaurant was well decorated. However, the service was average. There were not enough experienced waiters around. We had waited a long while to have someone to explain the menu to us. I took the recommendation and ordered scallop with salad as appetizer and pork lion as main course. My main course was not hot enough. Overall the food was OK but one would expect more in a fine dining restaurant
5
great view, great drink and great music. It's a great place to relax. It may be a little too romantic to hang out with friends.
4
At the 71st floor, you can enjoy a fancy cocktail (yes, they also do a Singapore Sling) in the bar whilst enjoying the view over Singapore if you are not in the rain clouds, before adjourning for a fabulous dinner at the restaurant.
4
Fantastic place for champers while the sun sets (and its happy hour too), what a fabulous view of the city. It gets louder and darker as the evening progresses and seems a favourite place to be for the younger local well-heeled.
4
great ambience. everything else isnt really that important. best when there is a thunderstorm coming over the top of the island
5
From arrival at the check in desk on the ground floor of the Swissotel the Stamford in SIngapore, to the warm welcome and attention received upon entering the Equinox Restaurant on the 70th Level of the hotel, our group found the whole experience faultless. The pre-dinner aperitif, entrees, main courses and desserts were all first class. The complimentary Moet & Chandon (provided as one of our group was marking their 66th Wedding Anniversary) was a wonderful and well received touch which further enhanced the outstanding and attentive service by our personal waiter and the Maitre D'. All in all it was an occasion to remember and we will for many a long day. Well done to all at the Equinox Restaurant and a huge Thank You !! (And the view is absolutely stunning as well.
2
Went to the Swissotel to have a drink on the top floor (70). On arrival, greeted with the message 'you can get the window seats if you agree to the minimum charge of SGD60 per person' which is plain ridiculous. Service was purely aimed at making money and weren't interested in welcoming a visitor to the bar, only making as much commission as possible and only if the visitors appeared rich. Best to avoid this place where customer service is rock bottom and visit the Marina Bay Sands view point
4
I had my business lunch and dinner at this restaurant during my recent visit to Singaore. The lunch is buffet style with reasonable spread on appertiser, side course, dessert with a main course on order. The food is good but the main attraction of this restaurant is the abience and view that it offers. The environment is worh the price you pay. However, service level during luch needs inprovement as the service tend to be slow. When I asked for certain item on the buffet spread, it was conveyed that it will not be refilled. However, the service during dinner is superb with good recommendation from the waiter and attentive service while not intrusive. I particularly like the beef that he recommeded but the portion is huge and suitable for two peroson's comsumption. At the end of the dinner, the restaurant even gave a photo to the group for souvenir. The view at night is great and is totally different from the afternoon

Went here to celebrate my first wedding anniversary. We paid extra 20 dollar for the window seat which was definitely worth it. The service here was good, the staffs were polite and friendly with awesome food and view. The only downside was the tables were cluttered and so close to each other. We can literally listen to the next tables' conversation. There was no privacy at all :(Please visit my post for more pictures and reviews: http://cristalglace.blogspot.sg/2013/05/first-anniversary.htm

My wife and I were at the Restaurant on 1 May 2013. This was our first time having semi-buffet lunch at the restaurant. We were there when the Restaurant just opened and we found that there were very few staff available to serve the guests. It was rather difficult to find a serving staff to attend to our request. Even for the order of main course we needed to wait for more than fifteen minutes and it was taken by the restaurant manager herself. More than half hours later then we found that the more staff were available. Nevertheless we still found that the service was not attentive and poor. The service staff were not even change my culinary when I was having fish. We were very disappointed and found that nowadays the Equinox Restaurant is totally different form what we have known last time

Went up for a drink and a quiet chat with a friend and enjoyed the view as the sun was sinking. Service is great. Dinner next time perhaps!

We made a reservation at 1pm a day before, and in my reservations, I asked for window seat (if available). There were 2 of us, and we were there on a business lunch. When we reached there before 1pm, there were still window seats available, but we were not ushered there. When we asked for the reason, they said that those seats (window seats for 2 pax x 3 sets) were reserved. I told them that we made a reservation too, and since we were there earlier, shouldnt they give us the seat? It was a FIRM NO, by this caucasian waitress called "Nikki". She mentioned that the guests will be there, and strictly under reservations, made us feel like second class citizens.I ordered a medium rare tenderloin and my business associate ordered a herb-crusted salmon. While waiting for our main course to be served, we helped ourselves to the appetitzers, soup and salad. We waited till 2pm (more than 1 hour) and our main course still NOT served! We also noticed that other tables who came later than us had their main course served. Service was slow, and we perpetually cannot find any service staff at our area. At 130pm, those reserved tables were still empty.....and this Nikki waitress had the audacity to offer the window seat to another couple who came in later than us the window seat, instead of us! She offered us much later, and at a squeezy corner seat, which we declined.The semi buffet selection was good and fresh, saving grace for the day. We waited for a long while, and after asking thrice for our main courses, Nikki finally served us our main course at 2pm (and the lunch ends at 230pm!). My business associate was happy with her herb-crusted salmon but I was appalled to find my 'medium-rare' tenderloin mainly uncooked....please look at my attached pic and tell that this is the 'medium-rare' standard. I didnt even want to ask that Nikki to get my steak replaced or cooked. I left it mostly untouched, and when she cleared my plate, she didnt ask me for any feedback. I half suspected that she purposely served us late and at 230pm, she came to our desk and asked us to leave soon as they would be clearing the lunch for high-tea buffet. Her service standards (or the lack of it) really put Singapore and the Swissotel Stamford / Equinox brandname to shame...Why let her be the frontline service staff if she's not service-oriented? Don't bother spending $$ here, go to MBS' Kudeta, better service, equally good view at the same price

Just moved to Singapore few months ago and we have discover this amazing place for the Sunday brunch. The buffet is very good and you can tried a lot of different things (sea food, Japanese food, Continental food ... ) and the quality is just perfect. The service is also very good and employees are very kind. Children are welcome and after the brunch, they can play or watch DVDs in a separate room
5
The view is fantastic. You can see the whole of Singapore busy city centre from the view offered. From the marina bay sands to the floating platform to the clark quay. A place to go if you want to see the city centre of Singapore, The food offered is good too.

Was once the highest restaurant ( in a building ) outside of America, it is a remarkable experience. The two story glass windows allow for completely unobstructed views of the CBD and Marina areas. The food was good, as was the service. You can get that in dozens of places in Singapore. What you can't do but in a few places, is have a beautiful bottle of wine on the 70th floor while watching the colors change of the city and the laser show at Marina. Our favorit

I was there to celebrate our wedding anniversary. They gave us a great table with an amazing view and the service was very nice. Definitely a place to go for a special occasion. The food is ok but the view is probably the best in Singapore.
5
We had a lovely buffet high tea here, with a fantastic view. werent seated at window side but view is as clear as day! Service lacked slightly, we were seated and not explained how it worked (we had only been to traditional high teas before and not buffet style). Also got told a half hour into the sitting that we had to be finished within the next hour. Apparently we paid more than most prices around singapore for a high tea, but the food and the view were fantastic. would go agai

We had dinner recently at Equinox Restaurant; a restaurant situated at the top of the Swissotel with perhaps the best view of downtown Singapore. The view alone is second to none. Sadly, the same can't be said of the food which is mediocre at best and terribly overpriced for the quality of what you get. I guess a major clue as to how the evening was about to go was right in front of us when we sat down; there were no tablecloths. Yes, for a place that charges high prices for food and brings the food out from the kitchen on nice shiny trays, they didn't even have tablecloths and its not like the tables were anything fancy to start with with some artsy or decorated tops; they are just plain black tops. Maybe it's a minimalist look they are going for. Whatever. It is worth noting the experience with Equinox when making the reservation; and the person I got wasn't the brightest crayon in the box. Upon reconfirming the reservation the day of the dinner I was met with an equally incompetent member of staff who couldn't tell the difference between the word 'confirming' and 'canceling'. Checking in at the lobby of the hotel before taking the lift up, we were met with another member of staff who was just as incompetent trying to find our reservation and couldn't tell the difference between names - no, my name isn't Anthony or John, not even remotely close! I already told you what it was! Strike three.We were seated just near the window (I was told it cost extra to sit AT a window table). The menu looked decent, but pricey. We have no problem paying for quality, gourmet food of a high calibre. But I DO have a problem paying for wannabe gourmet food quality at high prices. Sadly this is how I would classify the food at Equinox. The food isn't BAD per say, but it isn't anything I'd rave about to friends and certainly not worth what they charge. The bread was tasty to begin the meal. We both ordered soup to start. My girlfriend had the cauliflower soup and I had the lobster bisque. Lobster bisque was OK; it had a heavy seafood stock flavor which was sort of to be expected. The cauliflower soup my girlfriend had was decent but I've had soup out of a can that tastes as good if not better than that and at S$22 a bowl, the price isn't close to being worth it. The icing on the cake for this course was that it took about 15-20 minutes to show up but the saving grace was our server was at least very proactive in telling us of the delay and she is honestly the only reason I am not giving this a 2 out of 5 rating, she was actually pretty good. Our next dish was the scallops appetizer we decided to split. What a disaster. First, they took the dish to the table next to us. Our server swooped in and properly corrected the mistake by the other member of staff. But in all honesty, I wish she had let the other table have the scallops. What a disaster the scallops were. I took one bite and realized "gee these taste raw" and promptly discovered severely UNDERCOOKED scallops that were also incredibly UNDER-SEASONED and lukewarm, and quite paltry in size. Worst scallops I've ever had. We quickly sent the dish back. 10-15 minutes later, the dish returned with better cooked scallops but again, it lacked the necessary seasoning. Very bland taste wise. Does the chef on duty know how to cook scallops? By now, we had been seated for about an hour. The service here is terribly slow. Our main dish and entre for the evening was a Dover Sole that was for two that we split (that costs S$180!). This was the best dish all evening. Fish was cooked nicely, the capers and butter that accompanied it along with the lemon was a nice touch to add flavor, but again, the fish needed to be seasoned slightly more when cooked. The only thing I didn't care for was an incredibly bland rocket salad on the side that just seemed to be 'there' for the sake of adding some color to the plate. We also got some 'chips' that were just bland and lacked any seasoning whatsoever. We did order dessert, some pear dish with a pana cotta and sorbet. We wished we hadn't as it was just pretty blah. Nothing terribly imaginative or wow-able about the dish and the pears tasted like they came out of a can. We were ready to get out of there at that point. Like I previously said, the server we had was actually pretty good. She was pro-active in checking in on us but wasn't overly intrusive and given the previous three people I had to deal with regarding the reservation/confirming my reservation/checking-in, she was significantly better.The food on the other hand is mediocre and NOT WORTH THE PRICES THEY CHARGE! There are countless other restaurants in Singapore, some with pretty good views too, that have roughly the same prices but significantly higher quality food. We don't see ourselves returning to Equinox anytime soon, but at least the view was nice

We were enchanted by the spectacular views from the 69th floor but disappointed by the service and quality of sweet treats in the high tea. Savoury selection was good - particularly the kueh pie tee, laksa and vegetarian lasagne. But the dessert selection was boring and lacked freshness. The restaurant itself needs refurbishment. Looks a bit dated now
4
The Equinox high-tea buffet was spectacular. There was a good variety and I recommend the sushi and salad. The service was good, the view was magnificent. You are on the 69th floor of a building and you can see practically the whole of Singapore and look down at the Singapore flyer. The dessert could use a bit more variety but overall it was awesome
4
At $59++ fir lunch its great value for money considering the fresh seafood - oysters , Mussles , clams , crabs and prawns . The semi- buffet was filling enough but I had to have the main course so I chose the beef tenderloin which didnt disappoint. Good dessert spread too and a view to die for !

Myself and my partner were in the mood for a special dinner and the towering (70+ storey) Swiss Hotel Stamford beckoned. We reserved a table at Equinox on the 70th floor. Even after 16 years of living in Singapore, the view at night is still wonderful from this vantage point. Sadly, Equinox as a restaurant doesn't match the views.  Cost: S$315 for two -- including a S$20 charge for sitting by the window!! Outrageous when the main courses are between S$48 and S$70 each and a glass of wine S$27. We had one starter (a beetroot salad with two small pieces of goats cheese -- I had to ask for more cheese); two mains -- a galette of root vegetables and duck breast; one dessert and two glasses of wine.  The galette was a bit bland, small in portion size and not worth S$48. It tasted a bit like my grandmother's veges she used to cook in the oven. The S$70 duck breast dish was similarly underwhelming. The meat was a bit dry and there were only two pieces. I really expected more for that sort of money. Dessert was ok and wine was nice, but pricey. Overall, one of the most expensive meals I've had in Singapore in years and among the most bland.  On the plus side, the service was very good and attentive and the ambience of the restaurant was also very nice -- so go for a drink and eat elsewhere. Personally, I won't recommend the place to family, friends or business associates when they visit. Singapore has plenty of "sky" restaurants these days and with far better food. Equinox is trading on its views and needs to shape up

Before Marina Bay Sands this was the place with the views and it has not lost it, if anything the views now are even better (please check attached pics)The location is perfect and the food was good. We had duck and it was niceley prepared and served. Italian wine was great too. Service was good at the restaurant although we had a bad experience at the upstairs bar with below par service bordering in rudeness.We were surprised that the restaurant was half empty and not sure why. Granted it was Monday but in Singapore that should not matter. Perhaps a service issue? Maybe needs updating a bit? I would suggest to make it a bit more "cool", trendy, with 'Budha-bar" music, dim lights and fresh faces. This should be a hot-spot of Singapore. Tourists would love this place for the location, the views and the uniqueness of it. It is an experience rather than a "culinary experience" Now you need to keep atracting the locals.Good luck

For my wife & I this restaurant more than lived up to our expectations. Not only were the views superb, the food was too. The service was exceptional. The choice of wines (we had a different wine with each course) was great. One tip - book a window table

I celebrated my birthday at the Sunday Brunch with my husband and my 5 yo and 4yo and it was very enjoyable. There was a wide variety of food both cold and hot dishes, which was fresh, delicious and very appetising. Our children had their own kids bufffet set up in one of the lounges which was supervised by a staff member. They also had a wii and cookie decorating activities, so our girls were entertained while the adults enjoyed a relaxing brunch with a bottom less glass of champagne. It was also very affordable as we didn't have to pay for our chiildren because they were under the age of 6
5
We had high tea on the 69th floor of the Swisshotel - the perfect place to see Singapore - the view is breathtaking. The food was magnificent with lots of choices - from Singapore laksa, delicious crumbed prawns, satay sticks, ham, pasta bake, bakery items, burritos, too many choices to name. And the most delicious scones with jam and cream, macarons, tiny lemon meringue tartlets with a fluffy light meringue, mini chocolate bite sized tartlets with a berry on top, a yummy chocolate mousse cake, Danish pastries with fresh raspberries, various ice cream flavours, a choice of fruit including fresh dates - spoiled for choice! To drink we had coffee or a choice of the TWG tea served in our own little teapot. The service was very attentive and the setting magnificent. It was a wonderful way to spend a birthday. We are still reliving the memories - definitely returning when we fly over to Singapore again

We had water offered to us to start.. $23 dollars later by surprise. Quail cannelloni - dry, sickly, floury.. Bitter. Lamb rack with anchovy jus with potato and tomato with black olive powder... Disaster!! I asked for well done lamb I got rare, the potato city expected potato but it was. Flacoured and green with heaps of sage which was not listed on the menu. The black olive powder tasted like charcoal poison.. The tomato which was the size of a. 20cent piece was the best thing.. And even that was average. $300 dollars later we had charges on our bill that were unexplainable.. They chose not to help us or fix it and treated us like we were stupid. We were honestly surrounded by people that looked at the food and picked at it and were all so disappointed.. Can someone please explain by such a high end restaurant hasn't closed down for portion size and taste??????? Room service in swissotel is amazing compared to this and it only $30 per meal

Went specially to the buffet lunch when a family member returned to Singapore from overseas to visit. Not sure if it was the oysters but we all came down with diarrhea after the lunch along with fever. Not a good experience esp the visitor had a long flight back
5
The brunch was outstanding, foie gras, oysters, giant grab, sushi, goat cheese, the dessert is outstanding the main course was delicious the view is breathtaking and the service is amazing. But wow expensive, and well you also see what you are paying for, European cheeses and patiserie desserts its really all top notch and the best view in town. But still we paid a European 70 euro per person which is for Asia still a lot of money. Worth trying though if you want a lavish luxury experience with a great view to top it with

Celebrate my mum's birthday and had a great time.Our 2nd time back at Equinox, view so much clearer than the first time (back then there was haze)We all preferred the Smoked salmon dish as the appetizer. Others such as scallop, ham were pretty good too but we personally felt that the salmon dish was the best.Yes the food is pricey. But what you are paying for is excellent service. Had a wonderful server (sorry we forgot to catch your name) and was also pampered by Mahem who offered to help us take family photos and brought us around to see the view at the other lounge after dinner. Had some miscommunication when requesting for the bill but the problem was solved in the matter of minutes by the friendly cashier.Overall, we had a good time. Thank you Mahem and the rest of the staff! Also, thank you to the server who magically helped us to get a birthday cake when he said it was difficult/not-possible earlier. You made our visit special

Tried the set menu with wines matched to each course, at over £100 a head it was expensive but very memorable. The quality was outstanding as was the service. Sit by the window for the most amazing views
5
Excellent food, an amazing scenary of Singapore from the 70th floor of the Swissotel and very attentive service. Be preoared fir a very expensive bill, that is the only reservation tobthis greatcrestaurant.

I came for the high-tea. The food was good and I liked the fact that some of the dishes were presented on the chinese porcelain spoons. Easy and fun to eat!
4
The view is amazing and the live music makes it very funky. The drinks aren't cheap, so not the right place to get drunk...
3
The view is amazing. Unfortunately that is the best thing to say. Expect that more than a half of the money you pay is for the view. Food is not bad, it is just ordinary - like two small pieces of a good smoked salmon that with luck you can buy in a supermarket (several kilos for a price of a dinner) or 50g portion of beetroot salad which is not much worse than my wifes makes at home - and very expensive. We tasted a set and portions were small, a 5-set would no be fulfilling if not for a rich dessert. Air-conditioner was way too strong so it was cold inside to the extent that by 9pm the view was almost completely hidden by the water that condensated outside the window. Moet&Chandon stood out in wine card as a reasonable deal thanks to some promotion
4
They gave prompt reply when i wanted to book the best view seats on valentine`s. I got what i wanted, the best view in Singapore. (Facing direct to MBS)Not even a single fog. Food was not to my liking. I can said that i pay for the view and embience only. I will go again on NDP to see the firework

We visited Equinox three years ago, when it was under the excellent supervision of M. Phillipe Gantner – now sadly moved on. We had one of the most memorable dining experiences of our lives. We were back in Singapore last week and hoped to repeat the experience – sadly, this was not to be! The room and view are the same – stunning - but there all similarity ended. Our meal did not start well, when I had the temerity to suggest to the manager that I was surprised to be served salted butter in a restaurant with pretensions of excellence. Instead of the butter being quietly changed for the unsalted variety, I was subjected to a diatribe about the Michelin-starred restaurants, where the manager had worked previously, and which always served salted butter! Not an auspicious start. We were then presented with a small glass of what looked like tomato juice. It had various condiments mixed with it and was rather unpleasant. We had both made the mistake of ordering scallops. These turned out to be recently frozen, overcooked and 'presented' – I use the term loosely – on a pile of mashed peas... These dishes would not have left the kitchen of a competent chef. My wife's duck breast was good meat, perfectly cooked and finely sliced in a tasty cep sauce. Unfortunately, it had been left somewhere cool for ten minutes or so, and was barely warm. My fois gras was similarly nicely prepared, but served in a pool of totally inappropriate, over-salted fennel sauce. The Quail cannelloni was floury and pedestrian. The mainly female staff were friendly and did their best, but appeared barely trained. The place was simply not 'sharp'. Despite the price of the scallops and the window seat premium being waived, two starters, one main course and two coffees came to over £100 without drinks. Absolutely unacceptable – we shall not return! If you want to see the view, I suggest a visit to the bar on the floor above and a glass or two of Champagne. Then go to the nearby 'Glutton's Food Court' for dinner. We did just that the following night and had several courses of tasty, freshly cooked food for a tenth the price of Equinox

There are quite a few restaurants in Singapore with a fine view, yet I came here with friends this week for nostaligia's sake. I remember when this was known as the "Compass Rose" many years ago. The view remains one of the best and the decor has been maintained and upgraded so it is still a spectacular venue. However, that is the good news. Service was very good when "checking in" and being led to the table. Thereafter, though, it was patchy and getting the attention of a waiter was difficult, which was hard to accept, because the restaurant was not full. The menu is commendably short and the quality should, therefore, be superb. However, my appetizer (salad gourmand) was over dressed and poorly presented, while the main course (haddock filet) was overcooked. My friend reported his steak was very good.While it is quite good overall, I did not feel that this place represents value for money. The bill was about Sin$1,100 for 6 people for two courses a la carte, including 2 bottles of NZ white wine and still water. In a truly high-end restaurant, the "wow factor" means that this would not be an issue, but there is something lacking here, so it comes under scrutiny. There are a lot of high-end restaurants with good views in Singapore and I think I will try a few of the others before coming back here again
5
Some of the best views in Singapore, from the 70th floor, were only matched by the sensational quality of the food and service, and further enhanced by the reasonable prices. We were there for a lunch. And it was an absolute joy. We were there in June 2012. Will definitely be returning to this restaurant when we are back in Singapore in February 2013.Reservations a must of course
4
It's an experience you have to do once in a lifetime. It's quite expensive, hence only four points of this review. But the rest were just fantastic! The restaurant is located at 70th floor, so you can have an amazing view of the city. The service was superb. The food was excellent. And at that time we got a bargain for the champagne. Dress properly. A colleague could not get in cause he was wearing shorts. Enjoy
4
High Tea at the Equinox is a great way to view Singapore from up high. Their High Tea offering has a variety of food that is excellent.
5
Excellent service and fantastic view, you are on top of Singapore getting a very good understanding of how Singapore is designed
5
The restaurant has very good view overlooking central part of Singapore with relatively good food. Good ambiance to catch up with friends. Need to book in advance. Service was good and staffs are very helpful.
5
I visited the restaurant for lunch with my sister. From the moment you arrive you know it is going to be a special experience. Fabulous tables in a spacious and airy restaurant with the most amazing view over Singapore on the 70th floor. The food was simply wonderful, the five course taster menu was sublime and the recommended wines complimented the meal perfectly. It is not a cheap experience but I felt this was value for money for the standard of food and amazing service. Special thanks to Maximilian Bluemel for taking such good care of my sister and I. If by any chance this review is read by the restaurant I would love to know the name of the Mersault that was served with the fish course
4
Great and awesome view on the 70th floor! Was here for dinner so you could imagine the stunning view at night. We didnt manage to get window table, but just sitting next to window table is already enough to get a nice view outside. The food is very nice, worth the price paid. Nothing much differ from foods at MBS sky57, except that this reataurant offer lesser choices of food. So you dont need to think so much of what food to choose. For DBS/POSB cardholder, there is a promotion 15% discount on the food menu. If u are coming for anniversary or birthday, do inform them in advance during reservation for complimentary cake :).Expect to spend at least $350 for couple meal. I will definitely come back again :
2
Sure, it may be cheap (at less than S$40) and the views are unparalleled, but overall i felt it was a waste of my (little) money and (even more little) time. First up, they won't even let people in before high tea begins at 3.30pm - this is not the case in other hotels! Nothing special with meagre food spread. Requesting for anything from the servers takes forever. And about 15 minutes after the high tea ended this (i think) English lady who works for the hotel unapologetically (she said "sorry" - but really she wasn't) asked us to leave (excuse me?). In most places they would tell you that you have to leave in 30 minutes or so - gives some time to finish up the food/drinks and wrap up the conversation - but here we were asked to leave RIGHT AWAY. Never going back, nor will I recommend people to go there
5
I went for lunch with my boyfriend and it was fantastic! You need to make reservations at least 1 week in advance for the coveted window seats in the middle of the restaurant near the sushi counter. The service staff were non-obtrusive yet attentive and the food was good!
2
every thing is good.... but I hated it when we wanted to change our seat from 2nd from window to window and we were being told that we have to pay an extera $20 for the window seat. which obviously we won't mind if we are spending $300 for the food what another $20 wud b but common please get a life why you want to behave so cheap n charge juz a small amount on ur window seat aren't u already getting enuf on food...

My husband and I recently stayed at the Swissotel, Singapore and enjoyed cocktails at the New Asia Bar on the 71st floor of the Equinox Tower building. The views are wonderful with the backdrop of Singapore complementing our Happy Hour drinks and nibbles. Well worth the visit but check the dress code before you arrive or you may be disappointed
4
We booked High Tea at the Swissotel Equinox restaurant. They say "Smart Caual" dress required. I did not think this would have included shorts and a t-shirt, but there were many eating there who dressed extremely "casual". The food was good. There was a good selection of salads, main dishes, and the dessert range was lovely. Was it worth it? For the food, yes, but the fact they allowed casual dress did annoy me. I took notice of their dress code and dressed accordingly. But perhaps they wanted "bums on seats" and so ignored their own dress code.
5
Enjoyed a nice rest at 3:30pm. Buffet is proposed : both Asian and Western. Both nice. Then enjoyed the view over all Singapore. Around 50 SGD /pax. Not cheap but a full course. Your tummy will thank you...

This place is in the 66th floor of Stamford Swiss Hotel. They have a nice view of MBS. They serve high tea, buffet style. They have all sorts of food that you can not resist. They serve laksa, sandwiches, scones, dim sum etc. Nice place!
4
Nice place to have drinks and chill out watching Singapore view and hearing some very nice live music
The space is not big but very cozy to spend some time after the work.
4
Breakfast at this restaurant at 70th Fl was a great new experience.
If you moslem, you also need to ask the waiters, which one the Halal Food for you.
5
I'll admit it's a couple of years since we ate here, but it was spectacular. Amazing views and great food, comprehensive wine list. I remember it being a little expensive, but worth it. Try the bar if you just want to see the view
5
Had the semi-buffet lunch at Equinox.View:Amazing....it's the tallest hotel in singapore so you can see all around with 360 degree views. Ask for a table next to the window. Would be even more amazing at dinner time!Service:Above and beyond what would be expected.Greet you by name, my wife is allergic to nuts and when we pointed this out, they explained to us which foods on the buffet had nuts and also advised that any of the mains could be cooked without nuts.Chef even showed us around the buffet to show us which foods had nuts and they gave us a list of the desserts which had nuts in them!Food:Buffet foods was great...all fresh and well cooked. Sushi and sashimi were the highlights for me.Fresh seafood as well like prawns, crab, oysters and cockles.Main (choose one from a list of about 10) -> hence the semi-buffetMains were cooked to perfection - fish was not over or under cooked and flavours were great.Dessert: Definitely leave room for dessert!!! There's a huge range to choose from and all were amazing. From cakes, to fruit, to fondue and ice-cream!Overall:If you have the time (we spent 2 hours eating) and finances to do so, would definitely recommend eating at equinox. Lunch was $60 per head, which is more than reasonable for fine dining in singapore.Would be even better at night time with the views but service was above and beyond!
4
The Equinox Complex located on the 70th floor of the SwissÃ´tel The Stamford. Ideally located the view is speechless! Quite all tables, even not right next to the window, offer a very nice view outside.The food is very nice but not extraordinary. The choice (menu) is quite light and you don't have too many choices when making your selection. The price is high but considering the view and location, I estimate worth the value paid.On the side note, if you are hotel resident, you have a lot of advantages, like void the SGD 20.- to reserve a window table, discounted cocktails and more. Those advantages are not published or indicated in your room; better ask for your "in house advantages".I will visit this restaurant again, when travelling to Singapore

Our last night in Singapore we decided on Equinox on the 70th floor of Swissotel stamford? Fantastic view and great service were cancelled out by the poor value for money. I did not expect it to be cheap but $70 for two lamb cutlets and my wife had 4 small gnochhi for about $60 left us with a bitter taste. Just as well ther was plenty of bread. We did not bother staying for dessert. We won't be going back

I enjoyed dinner at this restaurant which was at the 70th floor of the Stamford Hotel, which is higher than the top of Marina Skypark and the top of the Singapore flyer. The views from my window table excellent and I was able to glimpse the light show from the Marina Skypark with a terrific vantage point. The chef was generous in giving complimentary touches and tastes. Most of all the service was warm and wonderful. I felt it as I was dining solo and yet the staff made my experience very special
5
Nice amosphere & view. The lunch buffet is good too. Perfect place for a romantic dinner/proposal.
cons booking needs to be made months before.
5
On the 70th floor of Swiss Hotel, the view is unrivaled. We could see to Indonesia, wehad a window seat. The meal was wonderful, they also have a water menu - many choices. Great for a special occassion
2
For the price they charge, you would expect a succulent and expansive spread for high tea at Equinox.
I was dissappointed and felt the price was evalated to match the 70th floor where the restaurant was.
The choice of food was poor.

Had the chance to have dinner here one Friday evening with the family and a close friend. All the food items we ordered were of exceptional quality- including the kids menu (kids had a steak). The only stickly which i thot was STUPID was that we had ordered 4 mains (2 adults and 2 Kids), and the last adult decided to only have 2 Appetisers. We were told that she had to order a main as well? i did not argue but found it really pretty dumb policy given we had bottles opened (wines/ champagne) etc. View was exquisite. Perfect
5
Fantastic view from the highest restaurant in Singapore. Arrive about 7:00 pm so that you have time to enjoy the view under daylight. Then it turns dark in about 45 minutes and you will enjoy another view with night illumination. Food and service is great, definitely worth to pay the bill for such an experience

I visited the Equinox on the 18th August, which incidentally, yesterday. I have two guests with me and I was expecting great service and food like the first visit for a romantic dinner. Unfortunately, we were given a table slapped between the service counter and the hot laksa station. I smelt like laksa through my next appointment after that. While I raised my concern, a Caucasian, or Australian service personnel offered to pull a chair to another table that was cramp and sounded really condescending as to whether we would like to take that table. Given the short sitting of 1.5 hours and considering the elderly guest, we remained at the allocated table. What was more insulting was the fact that the bill was given to my guest when my elderly guest and I stepped away to take some photos. Swissotel, are you sure this is the calibre of staff you have? will i return, probably not. there is ku te da with a view and good food, there are other places in singapore with a good view. if she should be the manager on duty, i wonder why her staff outshines her, should they be managing instead? perhaps she might want to help move the guests at the food centre instead? if not for my elderly guest and another guest, I would have just walked out and visit Pan Pacific or Conrad for buffet
5
I love restaurants with a view and the 80th floor of the Swissotel certainly delivers that. We were able to get a table by the window at fairly short notice as it wasn't very busy mid-week and were rewarded with a fabulous outlook over the city. We found the menu and food to be well up to the standard of the setting. In particular the gnocchi was delicious - possibly the best I've ever had. The service too was very good, attentive but friendly. Overall, a very pleasant evening and I shall undoubtedly go back to Equinox when I return to Singapore

The High Tea session starts from 1530hrs and end at 1700hrs for merely one and half hours only. High Tea suppose to be a place for people to enjoy, relax and admire the ambience of the restaurant especially ( in this restaurant) the spectacular views it had offered. However we didn't have such enjoyment, when we just finished the main buffet and about to start our dessert. we will told that the session was ending. So short and so rush and we need to book it months ahead. It really not worth the trouble for us to book and wait for the date to come
1
No denying the view is spectacular, particularly on a sunny afternoon like we had today. If you can get a window table you have unrestricted views all over Marina Bay, the Padang and Boat Quay. It is quite breathtaking. The only thing to consider on a hot sunny day is that the tables next to the windows are very warm. The food, however, is a real let down. A strange mix of Asian and Western food all of which is extremely heavy on carbs. It was all cheap food aimed solely to fill the guests as quickly as possible. Hardly anything of any quality. The desert section was about the best thing, but that doesn't make it great. Two types of scones with jam and clotted cream were nice, but the rest was pretty simple and not of great quality. Service was average. They certainly pack you in. When our single pot of tea ran out we were offered a top of up water, that was it. The view is definately the highlight, the food can be missed. There are plenty of places around Marina Bay for stunning view, some of which are cheap or even free. Try the rooftop of the Esplanade for a starter. Just keep going all the way up and follow the signs to the roof and there is a spectacular view completely free. If you want something to eat, go to the food court at Marina Square where you and get a good and cheap meal and enjoy the view. My favourite place for the view, however, is Level 33 at Marina Bay Finance Centre. A microbrewery with good view. Check out their Saturday brunch. Good value

We attended the Equinox restaraunt expecting a flawless and flavoursome meal that was as fine as the decor and setting, we were not disappointed. We ordered a special three course seafood menu, having the lobster bisque with crab cocktail, half a lobster with bernaise sauce and spinach and finished with a creme brulee. Each course was presented spectacularly, and there was enough time left between courses. The service was impeccable and the night was enjoyed thoroughly. I highly recommend coming to Equinox for a treat or special occaison, especially as the view is so wonderful
4
The view is amazing since I got the window seat (prior reservation).
Be prepared to spend since it's SUPER DUPER expensive (fine dining).
Don't come here to be full, but rather, enjoy the view and experience of fine dining.
5
As were staying in the hotel we decided to treat our selves to a meal here. As guests of the hotel we were given a window seat. The view is magnificant! The food and service excellent. Highly recommended if it fits in your budget!
5
The views are amazing but are quickly forgotten when eating! We had the Sunday buffet brunch. While it is pricey there is alot of beautiful food. I especially loved watching them make the crepes suzette!
5
Cannot book specific tables so get there around midday and get a window table. Fabulous views. Lunch buffet really is top quality and having the additional main course dish is always worthwhile . Cannot be beaten in my view.
5
Our favourite 'must do' everytime we are in Singapore. Was brilliant! A fantastic selection of foods ... the influence of the new Chef was evident - the best it's ever been ... great view. Overall a wonderful way to celebate a birthday in Singapore.
4
Every time i've eaten here i've been so disappointed. Whether it be the a la carte menu or the buffet its always so so. I can't deny the preparation, so it's not average, its good, but not very good.
5
Our family had a great time at Equinox and enjoyed every minute of the ambience, food and awesome view of Marina Bay Sands. The Buffet Lunch was sumptous and the staff were extremely polite, warm & friendly. (take note, for a window seat table, please book in advance) We will definitely visit Equinox again
5
Friday night, 9 pm booking - time for cocktails and olives in the bar before eating. Best Manhattan ever! Everyone raves about the views (we overlooked Marina Bay & the Esplanade) and rightly so, but the food is first-class too. There were six of us, aged 26 - 56, and we all enjoyed our choices. A bit on the pricey side (this is Singapore) but worth it. The only weak point? Don't order the cheese board - tiny bites and a pretty ordinary selection
5
We went for the mother's day brunch. It was not cheap but the buffet was delicious with free flow of most chandon, a rose and a family picture for each mom.They also had a small room with childcare where the kids went to chill out while we enjoyed our food.The staff are very very nice
4
My husband & I have been to the Sunday Champagne brunch at Equinox few times and never have been disappointed with the food or service. There were not as many food stations as the other restaurants but the quality was always good. My favorite; Foie Gras, Roast beef with Yorkshire puddings and for dessert, crepe suzette. The Champagne, Moet Chandon was free flow and many cocktails were on offered. These cocktails were created by Richard Gillam, Swissotel The Stampford's own Cocktail Architect.When making a reservation, request a table in the main dining area with window seat as the view is breath taking
1
This is a restaurant that serves minuscule portions and expects the clients to gush how fantastic the fusion cooking is. Happily there appear to be enough folk willing to part with cash for currents. Nice view though.
5
Good view, good service and good food. what more to have a enjoyable environment.
5
Ate dinner here with a colleague while staying at the Fairmont. Location was convenient for us since it was connected to our hotel and just a short walk away. The night view was spectacular!!! We splurged for the set menu and it was delicious!
4
Really posh. Good food and limitless buffet for 59 S$. the only problem is the formal environment. Also the seafood: oysters OK but the other shellfish tasted like nothing !
3
Buffet, no service, you even had to get and pour your own tea, tables without table cloths, no warmth to the room
5
We set out to impress some clients and were told that this restaurant would surely do the trick. The view from the 70th floor was really fantastic. The ambience is just great! We had the beef cheek as the main course. It was tender but a bit bland, until one of our group said to take a bite of the vegetables. Every piece explodes with flavor! Really an excellent meal... And the price...goes with the ambience. Even the ladies room is a "must-see". We had a Korean and a Filipino server and they were both very nice.It's the kind of place where you can imagine celebrating an anniversary, popping the question...et
3
Visited as in house guets get 50% discount. Open 3:30pm - 5pm only. Definately do not come expecting high tea as hot pastas, chicken breast, dim sums, cold cuts, soups, salads desserts and ice cream are on offer (good quality and replenished often). Would not pay full price but definately would visit again for the unbeatable view
3
We recently came to Singapore for a weekend getaway with friends that had never been to Singapore before, so we thought Equinox would be somewhere nice to take them. We had stayed at the stamford before however never had eaten at Equinox so first impression was great and service was excellent. The views are fantastic and you do have to book particularly if you want a window seat. We did not have a window seat but we had a great table so no complaints from me as the view is seen from anywhere in the restaurant.The prices are reasonable for the location however the serving for Entree was very small (the men complained) I was ok with my entree as I usually do not have one. I had the Crayfish for main course and there was nothing to it, and it was explained to us that there was more weight to it than what actually came out. It was a special and the price was probably the indicator that it was not going to be all that big.I have tried Equinox now and will not go back,though having said that it is worth going for a different experience. I will give them the benefit of doubt as it could of been an off night. Our friends were disapointed with their meals (sizing mainly not price) but were happy that they had gone for the views, ambience and Experience
4
My family is into buffets. We enjoy going around the various places for sunday brunches.After having tried a few places, I must say the one at the Equinox is the one I enjoy the most.The selection of food is aplenty. There is no short of any type of food that I enjoy. Many places do not serve Iberico ham, but they have it here as well.I can just spend the entire afternoon chomping on the ham.For those who enjoy desserts the selection is something one will die for. And of course not forgetting the juice section as well.The view and the ambience is also worth commending. Many restaurants tend to be noisy, but not at the Equinox. One can enjoy a quiet and enjoyable brunch in the company of free flow of wine and champagne, as well as singing angel from heaven - a live band.I think one will feel like they are in heaven when they are having brunch there

This isn't the review that I thought I'd be writing, but Afternoon Tea at Equinox is one of the best bargains in Singapore. My wife and I were on holiday for 5 days in Singapore. We generally like to find a nice afternoon tea on a trip like this and were originally considering Raffles. But we ran across a review of the "Top 5" afternoon teas and my wife was attracted by the buffet element, more than the traditional tea element.They run the place precisely on schedule and those with 3:30 reservations queued up waiting for the second hand to hit 3:30. With reservations booked on-line, we got a window seat with a spectacular view. There was a long buffet of food that encompassed many cuisines including Italian meatballs, Chinese dim sum, and other Western and Asian dishes. There were also stations for omelets and Singapore Laksa. On a raised level, there was a good selection of fresh sushi that was frequently replenished, as well as a wide array of seafood ranging from Scottish salmon to Thai salads. The back row was a dessert assortment that included typical tea-time pastries such as scones with jam and clotted cream, as well as fresh fruit and Asian desserts.There also was a station with chocolate fondue and assorted ice cream. Tea is a DIY affair, with a reasonably broad selection. Throughout the 90 minutes, service was top-notch with plates being whisked away, flatware replaced, and drinks refreshed. At precisely 5:00, they start tearing down and within minutes the food is gone and a bill is on your table.Back to the bargain part. When we booked this, my thinking was that at $43 per person, this would be a bit of a splurge. But just the night before, I spent $37 for a beer, a soda and an order of fries at a pub on Orchard Road. A couple days later, I spent $57 for a simple lunch at Chili's (we were caught in a thunderstorm; Chili's wasn't our dining destination). So, considering all that, with the view, the variety, the quality of the food, this turned out to be the "steal" of the trip
4
Way up on the 69th floor with a panoramic view of the Singapore harbour and city, this is a dining experience not to be missed! The carpark is frequently full on weekends so be prepared to wait in line or take a cab.
4
Lovely view of the city. You'd have to pay an additional SGD20 to get a seat by the window, though.
2
Although the view is great, the food is too expensive and too over the top in presentation and not delicious!
4
Pretty good food and great view (being at the top of the Swisshotel complex). Buffets are a little rushed as they have a short turnaround time for the next buffet (eg. lunch buffet to high tea).
4
Foie gras was good and the views were spectacular. Get a table right by the window for maximum oomph. Lunch buffets are a great value.
4
Equinox is the place to go for special occasions. The view is most likely the best in Singapore. From the 70th floor you see the whole Singapore and it gets better when it is dark. The service is excellent, but at least for us the 3 Course Tasting Menu by Chef Lee Bennett was a slight disappointment. For the starters the Salad Gourmand is without a doubt the best and richest tasting salad I have had. Classic Lobster Bisque is a good choice as well. The small disappointment comes from the Pavé of Salmon with Ratte Potato. The salmon is perfectly prepared, but these days salmon is so common and you can get it equally well prepared in many places. What you don't get though are the other ingredients: Beetroot,Marinated Black Olive and Frisée Salad and Basil Pesto. Chef Lee Bennett surely delivers what is expected. The dinner would have been 100% perfect if the fish selection would have been more adventurous than salmon (from Norway?). The other main course choice was Braised Beef Shoulder with Smoked Pomme Purée and it was just great. With some other restaurant I would have been extremely satisfied, but because the expectation level was very high I cannot give full points. Still we had excellent food, great ambiance, good service and an evening to remember
2
Way up to 69th floor in less than a minute! Warm greeting from the waitresses, so far so good but the impression and the ambient were quite 'so so' in fact can be defined as run down. Until approaching to the full drop down glass panel with the postcard scenery of breath taking Singapore night view, no one will not WOW, worth it!Wait till the menu, here you will get the worst than hawker stalls treatment. No a la carte! reason from the manager..chef will not be able to cope. You can either have 3 course or 5 course set??? Then another typical fastfood style service - a bottle of water, serve yourself if not, chop in to serve in the middle of your conversation with your guests... forget it. last time

I was invited to enjoy an afternoon of "high tea" by a dear friend in Singapore. Prior to arrival, she had mentioned to me the reservation was under her name. As we approached the young lady at the entrance to the "Equinox only" elevators, she clearly wasn't friendly, actually borderline rude asking us if we had a reservation. A smile won't kill, I promise.As we approached the second counter on the 69th floor (70th floor is the lounge/bar area), there wasn't anyone there, and we saw our dear friend seated already, so we just went in ourselves. We were seated at a large table right by the very large glass window. The view was breathtaking, the smaller Merlion, the "durian" building, the Sands Hotel, the Eye of Singapore were all visible, great location for picture taking. I found out the so called "high tea" was actually a buffet consisted of a mixture of Asian and "Western" cuisines, it was essentially a downsized lunch buffet. There was a chef making pasta and various sauces at one counter. We even had to make a pot of tea ourselves, the wait staffs don't even bring you water, because they had the water by the juices station. The only thing they actually served you at the table was coffee. Food was ok, nothing we never had before, some worse. Salad bar, cold appetizers, bread rolls, fish balls soup, porridge, a mixture of sausage, meat and chicken, sushi, fresh fruits, desserts, ice cream, pasta, that's about sums up all that we're offered. No big deal. The wait staffs were quick to re-fold our napkins every time we left our table, and removed the empty plates promptly. That's about the only interaction we had the whole 1 1/2 hours we were there. There was a white lady dressed in business attire (presumably the manager of the restaurant?) smiled at us a few times, I smiled at the waitress a few times, then we were shown the check because the buffet was closing, at 5 pm sharp. After our check was settled, albeit a lot more slower than when we were shown the check, the waitress gave me a comment card and told me to write her name on it with my comments. Really? For what? Besides folding napkins and removing empty plates, we had not gotten any service (which by the way was charged in the final check), probably because I smiled at her a few times? Shorter version: Views ~~ Stunning. Food ~~ Could be better. Service and attitude ~~ Plenty of room for improvement. Costs ~~ Not worth it
2
The view is what you are paying for in this ridiculously overpriced tiny portions of food restaurant. You are on the 69th floor looking out over Singapore and as the lights go on it is just breathtaking. Go up and have a look but please don' eat. We were ripped off
2
It was not a warm welcome when we waited to be directed to the lift that would take my friend and I to the restaurant. The white guy in front of us obviously received a much warmer welcome as the "attendant" was smiling throughout, although he was simply asking for suggestions; when it was our turn, not only we did not see the smile anymore, she gave me an impression that we were nothing but two irritants.The restaurant has a nice view, but if there are additional vegetarian choices in the buffet it would have been even better. Feedback given in written, and email address was provided, but nothing was heard of. I would think twice whether I should recommend others to this place
4
This bar/restaraunt is part of the Swiss Hotel. Great view from the 70th floor
5
High Tea with one of the best views in Singapore. Lots of small tastes from around Asia and the world. The buffet is a great value. Be sure to make a reservation in advance and it is popular.
5
Had drinks at the bar (new Asia) and it was a WOW venue with great views of Singapore. Drink were priced as you would expect for such an establishment.
5
Had a delicious lunch here whilst admiring the views over the harbour from the 70th floor!
Excellent buffet plus much more to chose from on the menu.
Service was excellent - friendly, knowledgeable and unobtrusive
4
Great view with reasonable food. Worth a visit for a drink in the afternoon or for the buffet dinner at night.
3
The food was well prepared, with correspondingly small 'haute cuisine' portions. Really tasty and cooked to perfection, would recommend chicken with foie gras sauce, pass on salmon filet, lamb was also very nice. 1 starter, 3 mains and one of the less expensive bottles of wine came to 400 SGD (£200). Mains are £30+.Views are not too different to upper floor rooms if you're staying in the hotel.Don't come hungry after a day of business, you'll end up in the 24/7 McDonald's downstairs afterwards tucking into something more substantial
4
My husband and I ate here in early march 2012. We were looking for somewhere with views as we were only in the city for a couple of days. The views did not disappoint. Neither did the food. We both got the 3 course set menu with wine pairings and a bottle of still water. Price S$390! Steep but the food was great, lovely wine and the service was excellent. To eat in a 5* place with stunning views, it doesn't come cheap!Would recommend
4
We visited on a tuesday so it was very quiet but the ambience of this bar and the views make it a cracking venue to spend a night having a drink. Entry was free for us but suspect at weekends there is a charge and drinks aren't cheap.
4
Certainly not cheap, but the food was very good and enhanced by the wonderful views. A three course meal was $100 Singapore and five courses $150. Wine is heavily taxed and the least expensive bottle was about $60 and some were over $2,000.If you are near the restaurant and have only one night for a dinner, I would suggest this be your choice. Reservations essential. Smart casual dress
4
From 12noon to 2.30pm each day (except Sunday), Equinox runs a semi-buffet. You choose a main and help yourself to starters and dessert from the buffet. I chose steak which was good and my husband chose the duck which was a bit dry and bland. The buffet favours seafood and includes soups, bread, sushi, salads, prawns, oysters, crab, parma ham and foie gras as well as cheeses, cakes, ice cream and sorbet and a chocolate fondue for dessert.The staff were very friendly and the views were superb. It was perfectly okay to wander around with the camera and take photos from different sides. Dress ranged from casual to after 5
5
70th floor Fantastic views and fantastic food book a table in advance and avoid being dissapointed
5
Expensive, but if you're looking for a treat you won't be disappointed.
5
Reastaurant on last floor of Swissotel Stamford. Magic view to the Marina Bay and to the city from 70th floor. Delicious cousine, attentive staff, it was unfogettable dinner!
4
you could save the expensive meal by paying $20 @ the SkyPark@ Marina Bay Sands instead. The food here is expensive & not worth the view even if you ate for 90 minutes long...
3
the food and view re great, but not the best value.
if your still hungry father (probably will be)
theres a maccers down stairs.
5
This was a great way to celebrate, food was superb.
4
The restaurant has a nice view both day and night. Always asked for window seat when making your reservation. Charges for the food is very reasonable.
4
Enjoyed drinks and a shared pizza while watching the sun set. Drinks high, but pizza a pretty good value and lits of food for under $30. Views of Singapore (northwest) are beautiful from the 70th floor but windows need cleaning, windows also seem to obstruct the views after being at Marina Bay Sands (open deck to walk/sit and take in more of a view). However it was nice and convenient to our hotel (Fairmont)
3
I really enjoy having dinner with such a great view but the portions were poor and overpriced in my opinion. I would suggest booking in advance as all the tables on the windows go pretty fast and if you get to pick on, I would go for the one in the far corner at the other side of the entrance. I had that one and you get the whole view which is breathtaking
3
Still classed as one of the best dining places locally,but properly over the price tags. View out the windows are still as lovely as it was decades ago.To me, it is not one of those places you will always bring your mother to every Sunday for lunch
2
Terrible service, average food and huge prices. View is fantastic, but just if you get a table by the window
5
the waiter staff are to be conmended tops all the way
5
Who wouldn't enjoy every minute of a 5 star meal window-side of a restaurant 70 stories high in Singapore? Excellent service, delicious modern cuisine, fabulous view over Marina Bay plus complimentary Chocolate Mousse Cake for our Anniversary! An unforgettable night. HIghly recommended.
4
Plenty of very good food - american and asian. High modern celing, much glass.
5
Great cocktails, well balanced with great live music and attentive staff. Fresh oysters and ham from the bone are also a nice touch.
Oh yes, and there's a nice view too!
5
we booked a table at this restaurant for Reunion Dinner, we order chnese set dinner, the scenery was very nice, we can see a bit of batam and johor, the food was very nice.
4
you pay for the view but then again, this is what it's all about - whether you're at the bar or the restaurant, take the time to enjoy your drink/food & the view
5
The view is breathtaking but you quickly forget about it when you taste the food! It looked and tasted amazing - My only complaint is that I couldn't fit enough in.
4
This is one of those restaurants where the overall experience is great. As you take the private elevator to the 70th floor, you get the overall sense that the experience will be special. As you exit the elevator, the spectacular view takes your breath away. The food served is a semi buffet where you have a choice of main course. Service is good and food quality os not bad
3
The food is not too bad, but if they could offer more choices for vegetarians then it would have been so much better. However, one thing I got to point out was...While waiting in the queue for my turn to get to the elevator then to the restaurant, I noticed something...The service person (a girl) at the entrance of the corridor at the lobby greeted a white guy with smile and making eye-contacts throughout their conversation (it was all about making a reservation, since they were talking not softly, you just could not not listen). Then next guest who was an Asian came by, and guess what? The girl hardly even smiled or made eye contact while speaking with the guest. This is atrocious and unacceptable. If that is how the hotel educates and instructs their guest relations, probably it is not a deserving place to go at all.That said, I am quite sure not all the service crew are behaving in that manner..
5
Although it is not cheap, the Equinox brunch is remarkable not just for the food and drinks but for the amazing view.
3
we booked ahead of our trip , they said strict dress code NOT , the food was o.k but not a true high tea as we know it , not many cakes more spring rolls and pasta ,my niece said the fullerton was better
4
Was staying at the Swissotel stanford and this place was right under it and made a great place to get some food and the general stores was handy to do some shopping.
The stores were worth a watch. Did not buy anything expensive.
3
We go to Equinox on every trip to Singapore and every trip it gets a little less special. The food is great, but the price is also large so you expect excellent service. When you are paying $150 per head without wine I didn't expect to be on a table 5 inches apart from the next one. The place has changed from a quality high tier restaurant into a 'pack em in' turnover restaurant which I'm sure will succeed for a while. However, with competition from Ku De Ta they need to raise their game again
4
Was there a few nights ago for a company dinner which was held in the private rooms rather than in the main dining area. So, while the main restaurant would have had more spectacular views of the waterfront and skyline, it could not be helped. Not sure how much better the food could have been had we to have paid for it, but what we got as part of a 4-course meal more than made up for it. Excellent smoked salmon & pumpkin soup as starters, so-so roasted chicken main dish, followed by a tasty toffee pudding. Worth going again just to try the rest of the menu
5
One of the hotels' jazz pub with brilliant view! Ask for the window seats (there's a min payment for them though) and have a bottle of moet & chandon ($79++ when on promotion)! Sit back and unwind at great price with live jazz singer at the background! Pizza is good too! One of my fav hangout! Cheers!But do remember to make reservations as it is usually full house in weekends... unless you pop by at later time like i always do :
4
I always feel that the best way to de-stress - is to take a day off and go for weekday hi tea with some best friends. This time, i took 3 days off - decided to try hi tea at somewhere with good view (instead of my usual fav place - Rose Veranda at Shangri La). First of all. we can't get through the booking line. Therefore, we took the risk and appeared at equinox without any booking, and was lucky to be given a table. Service was good. The waiters are courteous and attentive. Food was so-so. Wasn't too happy with the pastries selection - so didn't had any at all. Enjoyed the rose tea from TWG the mostView from Equinox was the best! I could see most of Singapore's CBD including the latest casino (Marina Bay Sands). Pricing - SGD $38 ++ (worthy for the view
4
We went for the brunch. The view is really nice if you can manage to have a window seat and the food is really good. Anyone can find is way with so many different dishes. Salmon with herbs was excellent, beef and veggies were very good. They have an amazing choice of very good cheeses and breads. To end, desserts are just perfect. Service was not perfect, the guy serving cocktails was totally lost (training phase perhaps) and some of them were not fully customer oriented. It's a little bit disappointed for a top class restauran
1
Seating is close together, everyone wants to have a window seat, so they cram you and at an additional cost for the privilege. I purchased a $200 bottle of wine which was poured stright into glasses without a taster/ sample which was unbelievable. It was then put in an ice bucket 10 metres away and I had to keep calling for a waiter/waitress over for a refil. When I went to the toilet it was blocked and on my way back to the table I had to move out of the way for a passing by waiter, who did not even say thank you let alone let me as the customer pass by first. Food had very litter taste or interest to it. I had a better meal in a cheap place a couple of days prior for $30. I paid $600 for this meal which I do not mind doing if it's worth the experience. This place clearly was not . It is a shame that such a bad restaurant has been put in such an amazing veiwing area

We read the very mixed reviews about Equinox but foolishly decided to go anyway just to see the view. How bad could a supposedly top class restaurant really be? Well, we found out! This has to have been the most expensive but worst meal we have ever had! We thought it strange that we were able to get a last minute booking on a Friday evening but thought maybe our concierge who had booked it for us had had some influence but no, when we got there we found it only about one third full if that. We soon found out why. On being shown to our table, well away from the window I might add, we were not offered a drink, we were brought butter but no bread and eventually had to ask for both. When it came to ordering we were expected to order desert along with the starter and main course! The food was mediocre to say the least and the wait for it was interminable. Had we wanted a desert life would just have been too short but like other tables around us, we cut our losses and left as soon as possible. We felt sorry for the serving staff who seemed pleasant enough but despite the restaurant being so empty seemed anxious and harassed.If you are thinking of going to Equinox donâ€™t do what we did, read the reviews and believe them for it really can be that bad! The view is good but not good enough to make a visit here worthwhile

Great location to have a business meal as the views are spectacular and the service unobstrusive. The food was very enjoyable with a good but very expensive wine list (e.g. $130 for a bottle of Cloudy Bay Sauvignon Blanc)

Perfect for a chic evening out, either one-on-one or with a group of friends. Happy hour is esp worth it coz u get to enjoy the amazing view at no extra charge if u spend >$60!

Super romantic. Unfortunately, the window seats need extra 120 SGD. However, the lounge bar's atmosphere is unbeatable. A little bit pricy but one in a life time is worthy.

Outstanding view
Superb service
Food is also good but nothing beats the view :)

I reserved a table a few weeks before through email and I really appreciate how quickly and easily my reservation was made. Just a day or two before the dinner, I received an email confirmation from the restaurant for 3 June 730pm. However, on the actual day at about 7pm, I received a call from the restaurant asking if I am still making it for the dinner at 630pm. I explained that I have an email clearly stating 730pm instead of 630pm. Upon arrival, we were shown promptly to our table and was shown the menu. I feel there could be more options for the set menu. There is only a choice for the dessert. It's not difficult to include maybe a cake, cheeses or even ice-cream as some alternatives.Please pardon me for not being able to recall the names of the dishes I took. But I would like to still give my opinion on the food quality. Amuse bouche was cream of pea or asparagus. It was first presented on a spoon and was served as it is on the table. Perhaps it should be served on a plate so that the spoon remains clean to be put into the mouth. The texture of the mousse was not smooth as too much gelatine was used. The ham bits that were sprinkled on it were too tough and lack crispness. The minute fish was well seasons and tasted good on its own. Unfortunately the jelly of beef was overpowered by the seasoning used on the dish and I can't taste the beef but the pepper. The ribs texture is pretty good except that the ribs could be trimmed more to remove the rather rubbery fats. The asparagus were not peeled and under seasoned. The mushrooms were not cooked well and under seasoned. The pastry underneath the vegetables are soggy and redundant. The dessert was a disaster! What is a chocolate soup? If its meant to be a fondant, just make a fondant. The portion is just too big. It portrayed to me that the kitchen is not capable of producing proper fondants and that a bowl is used to help in the cooking process. The texture of the chocolate soup is not great either. It can be smoother.The greatest disappointment for the evening was the guests. We were placed between a table of 4 and a table of maybe 12. Why would the restaurant place couples who tend to celebrate romantic events together with big tables who tend to generate most noise? I was most mad at the table across us. There were 4 of them on the table and they just spoiled the whole evening for me and my wife. The girl on that table was so loud and rude with the contents she was talking about. I tried so hard to tune out their conversation but they are just loud. I applauded the restaurant for the rather reasonable priced menu but the crowds that it draws are much to be desired. Finally, although I agreed to pay an extra for the window sitting but I don't think it shows very well of the class the restaurant is portraying. Windows sitting could be on a first come first serve basis and guests are rewarded for making advanced booking. I don't even pay extra for window sitting at burj al arab and armani hotel which are definitely a class ahead of equinox. I would like to thank you and those at equinox once again for the dinner to celebrate my 10th wedding anniversary. It is also the same place where I proposed to my wife 11 years ago. Unfortunately, I won't say I am impressed with the Equinox this time

We were staying at the Fairmont so decided to have a late dinner at the Equinox. The restaurant was fairly empty but we were shown a table in the 2nd row away from the window. Since there was space by the window and this is why we primarily visited, we asked to be moved. There was great relunctance for this to happen and were eventually told that there would be a $20 per head service charge. We asked to be moved anyway. When this happened we were placed amongst a tight crowd totally blocking the view of those couples in the 2nd row, when there was obviously plenty of space.The service was atrocious. Our wine was driblled down both glasses and not tidied up. The waitress continually pushed herself across us without apologising. The table was not not kept tidy. And although we only had a glass each, I noticed that those who had ordereed bottles had to serve themselves from the buckets that were left a distance from their tables.My wife had the pork dish. I had the steak (that was too rare) with the wasabi mash (which was a sliver of potato mash flavoured with wasabi. Very disappointing. And expensive. The view was great but you could get similar at the Marina Bay Sands for only $20.Very very disappointing, ridiculously expensive and worst type of fusion cooking we have ever come across

Loved this place for lunch, choices are plenty and food is fresh. Settings are nice too which entice you to eat more than what you really should have.You get to see Singapor skyline if you happen to find a table by the window.Service thou is a bit slow. I loved the starters and desert spread

Every time when friends and relatives from Europe visited us in Singapore, we always gave them a surprise - dining in Equinox. All liked it very much. This time is not exceptional. We just heard "WOW" from our friends, we know it's a right choice again.We had a table for 4 beside the window where we can see the spectacular Marine sands, skylines of the city and ocean, it's just fantastic! I guess the night view is great as well.We had a lunch semi-buffet including main course, buffet choices are abundant and the taste excellent. I like the desserts very much, it's like I'm totally lost in a paradise of sweet things. The staffs are very friendly and well trained. This restaurant is great for romantic dining as well as a few friends gathering, highly recommend

After two years, my husband and myself went for second time to Equinox to celebrate my husband's birthday. The first time the experience was amazing in all senses: delicate service, excellent food (we order the best sea food platter we ever had, champagne, a bottle of wine and a dessert) and we paid a reasonable price for that. The second time, last Friday 11th of March, it was the most disapointing experience at all levels: staff service (the head waiter had too much attitude) was indiferent, the menu was very limited with over priced dishes and, afterwards, we ended having some extra food in Mc Donalds as we were still hungry. We ordered two lobster ceviche as starters, a steak (for my husband) and scallops for myself as main dishes (please see the picture attached 79 SG dollar for 3 scallops ...) And since it was my husband's birthday, we received a birthday cake which was served to us as they were obliged to do so ( we were pretty surprised about that cold attitude, specially in such a restaurant).We will never come back to Equinox and our advise is to spend your money somewhere else. There're plenty of nice restaurants in Singapore. The only positive thing we must say is that the views are amazing, that's all

From 70 stories, the Singapore skyline doesn't get any better. The food is there to compliment it. Even though prices can go up to outrageous amounts, the view and the food are well worth it. I personally enjoyed the duck, as a main there is a small range, but there is a huge variety of appetizers you can pick from. From Sushi to Ice Cream, you can definitely find something you can eat
2
The only good thing about this restaurant is that the view is great. The food is mediocre. Menu very limited. Wines overpriced. Extremely slow service. They have many waiters/waitresses but I think they should hire more kitchen staff. The slow service spoilt everyone's mood during our visit

Let us start with the view, which ist for sure great. Forget the rest. We specifically requested a window seat which we did not get. On the top we got a switch of our table to the window. The surprise at the End of the dinner: they charge you 20 SD for the window seat! Very poor, sorry, no style at all. Dinner pretends to be some kind of stars, Forget it. Poor chef. Further, all the wines had wrong temperature and the service had no clue about wine. The service was really disappointing, they did not care about us. Bottle of water was not on the table but nobody wanted to bring us water, same applies for bread

Had dinner there with my fiancé specially arranged by her . She booked a window seat , extra $20 /- . Definately worth it ! The view was stunning ... We had a 630 reservation and could view the day and night view , service was top notch . The served complimentary appetizer . We each took a 3 course menu with champange and it worked out to $300/- . They also provided a complimentAry cake as it was my birthday and they took a photo and enclosed it as a gift ... Very toughtful . The food was above average and they also provide complimentary bread with a great selection . Worth it for the special occassion

I couldn't believe it, sensational views and of course a big price, I had pork belly for my main course, the pork belly was like a piece of leather and it was served with mashed potatos and it was packet mash, I haven't had it for years and it was disgusting, for that price I think they could of bought some potato

Booked for dinner with a window seat for our 15th wedding anniversary. A big disappointment.We knew the food was expensive and were actually looking forward to tasting food that made you go "wow!" We understood the portions would be small, but when they arrived my wife and I actually laughed to each other about how small they were.We were offered bread, a choice of three different types, with 3 different spreads on the table to go with them. We both chose an olive bread. A very nice start to this fine dining experience. But sadly this was the highpoint of the meal.As an appetizer we ordered the stuffed tomato and tuna with beef.The tomato was an over-sized cherry tomato, maybe 4cm in diameter "stuffed" with a teaspoon of goat's cheese. And the "wow" factor was that we could do better ourselves in our humble kitchen at home. Nothing special about this plate. The tuna was presented as 5 small pieces of sashimi tuna and was actually not too bad. I enjoyed it as an appetizer. The "wow" factor was the beef, it was bland bordering on unpleasant, I have tasted better processed sliced beef mass packaged in supermarkets.Our mains were a fish dish with a potato lasagne and scallops. The fish was again only a small portion and nothing really special. Once again, we have done better in our own kitchen, disappointing for the price being paid. The potato lasagne was interesting and a new taste well worth it. I would have preferred this "side" dish to anything else that was served up that night. The scallops were one scallop away from being unable to be described as scallops plural. The dish consisted of two overcooked scallops that were uninteresting and did nothing more that add a label to the dish and 3 small fish cakes, which while having a taste of their own were very simple fish cakes, no contrasting flavours other than "fish".We do not want to seem ungrateful as we were celebrating our 15th wedding anniversary the staff presented us with a chocolate mousse-cake compliments of the house. But, by then, they had lost us and we simply wanted to get out of there and celebrate somewhere else.If you are going for the view, go upstairs for a drink. Don't go for the food. We had a much nicer lunch in Little India, with contrasting flavours and textures, subtle aromas and good service for 10% of the cost of Equinox

We were staying in a harbour view room at the mandarin oriental last week and thought that our room had a good view. However, when we walked into Equinox we were quite taken aback! Ensure that you ask for a window seat, and you will be hard-pushed not to stare out of the window the whole meal..The food is excellent with great attention paid to the presentation. I would recommend the foie gras starter in particular. A definite must during a stay in singapore

I paid s$90 for tea at the Equinox and it was definitely not worth it. They could not find our reservation. The food was lousy - sushi was stale; noodles were oily; miso soup was very sour; scones tasted as if it was purchased from a supermarket; selection was very limited.Service was lousy .. I could not find a soup spoon and asked the waiter for one and the answer was ..'soup spoons are located near the soup station' ...the other waiters were sour and was not very pleased to serve their customers.The view was good

I just have Brunch with my brother from Hong Kong yesterday. The comment regarding the food, environment and service from both of us is terrific. The Brunch was highly rated by my brother who has been working in fresh food mechandising field for almost 25 years and is presently serving as Mechandise Director in a global firm. He always annoys me for his fussy attitude towards food as he almost has tasted good food all over the world. But this time he highly rated the food in particular the oysters and caviar even the display. For me, I felt lucky as I eventually can please my fussy brother in relation to bring him for good food

We have been to a good number of Singapore restaurants for Christmas brunch and this year we decided on the Equinox, mainly in response to its illustruous advertising. When booking, we had asked for a table at the window to enjoy the view from the 69th floor. The response was that although available tables were on a first-come-first-serve basis, we would be looked after upon arrival. Well, that didn't happen of course and instead we were seated at a table as far removed from the window as possible and at the furthest end of the restaurant and with poor aircondtioning at that.That was disappointment number one! Disappoinment number two, and all possible numbers thereafter, were due to the quality and taste of the food and the reluctance by the staff to at least look eager to serve. The food was just really badly prepared and tasteless. Initially we thought that we should not be so fussy, that it was perhaps only a dish or two that did not come up to our particular tastes, but it proved to be the case with nearly all the dishes - it was difficult to find something we could enjoy.The impression was that of an unorganised restaurant where the staff was not trained, but hastily appointed in order to tend to the particular Christmas rush. Whoever did the cooking should go back to school or at least check with other restaurants to come up with some comparisons.The cost of this meal did not warrent the shabby service and tasteless food.We were very disappointed

I have to agree with most reviewers here on this one. Stuffy to the max, the food's mediocrity is matched only by its outrageous price and poor service (the Raffles Grill is soooooo much better). The view is nice but hard to enjoy when you take into account the overall negative experience at dining here and paying $500 for the privilege. I would not take anyone I wanted to impress here though as the food and attitudes will turn off anyone who has truly traveled and enjoyed a real 5 star dining experience. As a restaurant this would rate no better than a 2 or 3 in LA or NY. The view does not save it IMHO.Too many other great choices in Singapore

The refillable snacks are so YUMMY! & the drinks... potent! Nice!

Went to Sunday Brunch last weekend with my wife and had a great time. A bit pricey but the food was sensational and the free flow Moet was just that - free flowing.
For something a bit special I recommend it highly.

for the awesome view

Have the best stunning view of sunset overlooking the city, great ambiance with a first class service.

We had a decent - not great - meal for 5, without wine, and with one vegetarian (lower cost on the menu). The vegetarian options were limited and uninspired. The other main courses were fine, nicely presented and interesting but again, not inspired. Excellent tarte tatin, though. Still, at $600, this was terrible value - there are numerous places where for half the money, the food is twice as good, and there is a pleasant ambience if not a spectacular view. My advice would be to visit the 69th floor reception area or one of the bars on the 70th floor for the view, and then go dine elswhere

They claim this is an exclusive luxury restaurant, and delayed letting us in for 10 minutes until they checked with the General Manager as I wore sandals, even though women can wear sandals. Others wore jeans and golf shirts, quite a double standard. We went to this restaurant mostly for a romantice dinner, as the view of Singapore is spectacular from the 70th floor. We knew it would be expensive, but not as expensive as it was. I don't mind paying $400 for a good meal (including wine), and have eaten at Ramsey's restaurants and other 5 star establishments. If you want a window seat, you have to pay an extra $20, even though we stayed at the hotel affiliated with this restaurant. Not a nice surcharge for your guests. Upon arriving, we were "pushed" to make our selections, and felt rushed. As we didn't make our selections immediately, it put the wait staff off their routine, and service was painful after that. We felt as though the restaurant wanted to push us in and out, so they could turn over the table faster. The food was good, but not spectacular, presentation very nice, portions very small, as expected. If you want the view, go to the bars associated with this restaurant, you'll still pay lots, but less than this restaurant

In this restaurant you will pay for the sight seeing outdoor, and not for your dinner. What a terrible dinner, we are frequent quests of the best restaurants, we eat over the whole world, mostely in michelin star restaurants, and we had thought this was a good restaurant for having a great dinner with super view over singapore. Now the view was superbe only the dinner it was a disaster, very small portions, no wine with the starter, a very quick service, no ambience, realy not for recommending. We had a better stay during our visit to Swissotel the Stamford in the Executive lounge, they know what service is ment to be, we think the staff of the restaurant can learn from them, they are amazing! But Equinox, never again

We booked Equinox as we had visited the restaurant many years ago (1992) when it was "The Compass Rose". We remembered it had a magnificent view of the City and wanted to see how it had changed.I wish we hadn't bothered. It might be very posh and plush and look like a top class restaurant, but we had much better food in Raffles Grill, at a fraction of the price!In order to get a "window view" we had to book for either 6.30 pm or 9 pm. We thought it too late to eat at 9 pm so had to go for 6.30. This was really too early for a meal in SingaporeThe choice was quite good, but the prices were unbelievable. A Wagyu steak cost S$120, over Â£50, which is way over the top. We didn't pay anything like this in Raffles Grill, and I wasn't going to pay it this time! I had to settle for a sirloin steak which was so small I could have missed it. My husband had duck which, if he had sneezed, it would have disappeared! I know this is a gourmet restaurant but that was ridiculous.Dessert was beautifully presented, but again really tiny.As the food was so expensive we couldn't afford to buy the wine, so settled for cocktails.We are not stingy people by any means and always have at least one gourmet meal when in Singapore, as we like to try something different. We don't mind paying over the odds for a meal as long as it is value for money and tasty, but this just didn't live up to expectations

I must say the view on top of the restaurant is CRAZY!!!! Located on the 69th Floor above Swissotel Stamford Hotel. The food are mostly snack food & you only have a limited time to eat the buffett from 1100am to 02.30pm(Sunday Brunch). Service staff was great
5
Our hotel had no view so we asked where we could go for a good one and were told Equinox. The hostess on the ground floor looked us over and told us to go up to the 70TH floor. We noticed a bar and asked if they did meals so decided to have a drink with something off the bar menu instead of a full blown meal in the fancy restaurant. The view is best over by the dance floor where you can see the Singapore Flyer (like the eye in London) very cool atmosphere, could have been in Vegas. Then we wanted desert so we went to the restaurant where we were looked over again and told we couldn't eat there because my husband had shoes that were not completely closed. We explained that we'd been told downstairs we could eat there and the hostess checked our name and said she'd have to check with her manager. We were shown a table tucked away so as not to offend anyone looking at the open part of my husbands shoes! We ordered the phenomenal chocolate dessert for 2 comprising of 6 shot glasses filled with white to dark melted chocolate with fruit, shortbreat and other delectables to dip. A real treat

Romantic Environment, It is recommended for Anniversary

Food......soso,
cosy ambience and great scenery!

While the food may not be at its best and usually Ill just eat the snacks, I must say that their 'Brown - Out' Blend is pretty good. Well the excellent
5
I highly recomend going for high tea at the Stamford Swissotel. It is on the 69th floor with absolutely spectacular views of Singapore Island. Food was amazing and very reasonably priced. Booking is a must and gents must wear long trousers to go to the Bar on the 70th Floor

The view is perfect, but the price really kills. Went for a set dinner with wine for 2 and it cost around $300-$400 ...The food was okie but I personally felt the serving can be a bit bigger ( I wasn't really full after I finish my meal). However, if you are looking a good atmosphere place to be romantic. This is the perfect place

The view is fantastic. I actually prefer Jaan. Service is good as well

Magnificent view from one of the tallest building in city area! Ambience/view: The night view is simply breathtaking! From thousands of dazzling lights to the view of Singapore Flyer, Esplanade, the marina, the sea.. The floor-to-ceiling windows add a whole new boost to the view. Interiors are touch of east meets west, with classy western cutleries, winery and traditional chinese wood carvings, pillars etc..Food: Only tried an ala-carte menu at dinner.. The cod fish is simply delectable and it somehow melts in your mouth! Steak is slightly better than average only..Cost: Cost is rather steep. But it would be a good place to celebrate special occasions.. Its ok to burn your pocket once in while I guess..Service: Not much chance to be served but the service reputation of this restuarant is not very good for many...Conclusion: A high-class restaurant with a spectacular view! Award winning dishes are worth a try.
