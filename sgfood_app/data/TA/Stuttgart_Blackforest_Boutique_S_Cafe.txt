We ordered the starter Pork Belly, but they served Pork Belly Pasta! And the server insisted that we took it because he said he repeated the order to us then we agreed. We even pointed out the menu to him when we were ordering. And unfortunately the pasta was too salty. We don’t come back again, too disappoint.

Came here for the first time this weekend after being caught in the rain. I was pleasantly surprised to see some very decent offers for some of the beers, being offered on a 1:1 basis. I really liked the Palmbrau hefeweizen. The Radler, however, was a bit sweet for my liking. We had a bit of difficulty with the billing system on the way out (there being some confusion as to the meaning of 1:1), but other than that it was a good experience. Didn't try the food

I booked the place for a family year end dinner - and the overall experience has been good, where I especially like the following few areas: (1) Platter with Pork Knuckle with sausages, cutlet etc. is good - Portion is reasonable and it should be good for 3-4 pax. (2) Service is good - staffs are polite and attentive (3) I was there during one of the evening in the week day - there is a 1-for-1 promotion of the German beers, and happen that on Wednesday, there is also a free beer for any female within the group. (4) Desserts are good - I like the Blackforest Cake, Brandy Tiramisu as well as the Cheese Cake. If you happen to travel to the place via Public Transport - You can take the Downtown line train service, exit Bencoolen Station, and and exit via the Brash Basah Road exit. The restaurant is at the ground level at the Rendezvous Hotel

We went all-out and sampled almost all the food on the menu! By far, the platter seemed like the best deal, crispy pork knuckles, fat juicy sausages, chicken & pork snitzel, and all the trimmings like saurkraut, and red cabbage with lovely sauces. The beers on offer were 1ml per cent. Dark and light ales which we're refreshing and the French res wines were full-bodied and on a good offer too. All-in-all, a great place to meet up and feast !

Nice place! Went on Wednesday evening - Ladies' Night! with live music! Love the lemon meringue tart and apple struddel

Went with the work gang, enjoyed the Engel Beer but didn’t care too much about the food with one exception the Black Forest gateaux which was yummy.Wouldn’t go out your way to visit this one unless you have a hankering for pork knuckles , sausage and bad pizza!

A good place to chill and catch up with friends. They have a variety of food suitable for everyone. The alcoholic beverage selection is awesome, ranging from german beers to wines. Their food portion is of a good size. The manager and his staffs were very polite and helpful. This was in fact my second visit. They have updated their menu and you can find the exact one in their website

Well, interior decoration was great, felt like in an old traditional German house as seen in a book story However, food was just okay, the pork and chicken schnitzel tastes like Japanese chicken katsu, apfelstrudel was also standard the crust was bitter (we did not finish it!), service was just normal, music was too loud and hardly talk during the band played, the worst they charged $1 for each cup of tap water and $10 for side dish (red cabbage and so forth in which they did not mention it as an additional hence we got impression that the side dish was the normal thing that complement the food). Not really impressive

Great, less-known German beers, particularly from Stuttgart, are the main draw here. Impeccable service and cool, dim ambience. Food - standard German / Western fare - is average.
Come during Oktoberfest.

My friend ordered a squid ink risotto and it was mad salty and we have no choice but to inform the staff as it can't be swallowed.
And this is how my sausage pasta (forgot the name) look like.. the taste is horrible too.

Enjoyed the specialty pork hock for my birthday dinner. So well cooked and presented, a real highlight of a meal on our holiday

Let the staff know that you are staying in the hotel to enjoy a 10% discount off your bills. Try their famous blackforest cake and their trotters, and wash it down with their German import beer.

A nice and cosy place which serves German food. Good ambience with friendly staff. If you miss Germany, perhaps can pop by for a German Beer!

Came to Stuttgart Blackforest Boutique S-Café with my dad and family and we were pleasantly surprised! The staff was welcoming, the décor immersive and it didn't feel like we were in the middle of the city. Easily assessable yet a space carved out for happy dining. There are lots to do and see in the cafe; from a piano to books to unique German decoration and I didn't get bored walking around the place, lots to see and explore. The food selection was wide and important to me was that the fried food was light and not jelak and overwhelming. Every dish was paired nicely with a side which brought out the flavours. Within the cafe is a wide selection of wine and beers which gave a nice touch to the experience. Do not be deceived by the selection of pizzas, thinking they are just fillers. The crust is special; thin and lightly burnt and very robust in flavour. Yummy is the word. Offering a selection of seats, from small and intimate, to comfortable sofas to long tables, I could see myself hosting large groups or meetings in this place. Car parking coupons can be redeemed or bought at the counter (which was brought to my attention by an attentive staff). A full experience and do check them out. You might just find a place away from work to hide, hang or to host. Open enough to find, placed well enough to feel comfortable

I was on a staycation with my spouse and ate at the Stuttgart S-Cafe. Ordered the Pork Knuckle and black forest cake. The pork knuckle was good, and the taste was not exactly like in German, but with a subtle twist. The use of a little onion shallots in the dish seemed a little out of place; I would prefer it not to be included. The cake was good!Decoration wise, it was nicely done up with a picturesque homely layout near the front, with soda and stuff toys

By Singapore standards it's quite dear but that's only because good food is so cheap here. Prices are par for the course compared to places tucked under hotels in other countries. I enjoyed the food. I've found food portions quite modest in Singapore. My younger self would've wanted more but I don't mind at all now. Bamboozling people with quantity at the expense of quality is not part of the culture it would seem. The pork knuckle was more like a slice of pork knuckle but it was tasty and moist. When I've had whole pork knuckles in Germany and Australia they've often been dry in the middle. So I've no complaints. The Black Forest cake was once again just enough and pretty good. Very satisfying meal. If they installed a proper Italian style coffee machine with a barista to operate it rather than one of those push button affairs one often finds in airport lounges I would give them five stars. Some sort of diet cola on the menu wouldn't go amiss either.

A "woody" ambiance, not really my liking, the place is dark and not really cosy. ( personal opinion) Food was average. We ordered a super platter ( for 4 pax) to share, is enough to feed 6 pax ( 5 ladies , 1 man)Pizza was thin and flavorful, is something which i will order again. We went on a wednesday night, there are live band from 7-9pm. Generally, the service there for that night was good. Staff are very attentive. Cheer

We went to S-Cafe for the "Stuttgart Frühlingsfest", or Spring Festival. The deal was $100 for 4 hours of food and drinks (including beer and wine). As an "early bird' booker, we even got 20% discount. The place tries to replicate a German restaurant/bar and it actually worked! Staff is very welcoming and friendl, they were all trying to make us feel at home! We were 30 minutes early, but the guys placed us at our table and served drinks already, we weren't even allowed to pay for it! The buffet was great, pork knuckle, pork belly, salmon, sausages, salads, soup, pretzels and lots more! The glasses were never empty and as mentioned, food aplenty! Definitely a place to o to if you like German Cuisine and if you like beer! Will definitely go back! Oh, and on a side note, we ordered Jaegermeister. The shots were miniature bottles...and of the 30 bottles we emptied, we built a Jaegermeister Tower...you can see t on their Facebook page... Brilliant, big thanks to the S-Cafe

The cakes were fantastic. Would have spent the entire week there if allowed! Great people and very pleasant surroundings. Thank you all.

We tried the pear pie, cheese cake and blackforest pastry. With each desert, a cup of coffee is served for 4$. the coffee was good but the black forest was the clear winner amongst the desserts

You dont expect to "go German" on your first night in Singapore but its just what we found ourselves doing. We arrived fairly late and stayed at the vintage Rendezvous Hotel (also recommended) and the Stuttgard Blackforest Cafe is situated in the court yard/patio of the hotel. From the outside the place looked warm and inviting (not that we needed wamth in Singapore! - perhaps homely is a better word) Burt inside was decorated in an interesting clutter somewhere between a ballet set and a hans christian anderson movie set. As you settle into your meal you are surrounded by features such as tin soldiers, a piano, cuckoo clock, antique furniture and other pieces of art and interest. It all immediately added to a "chalet style" atmosphere in the most unlikely of places and a very proper environment for the selection of very germanic food on the menu. Our food was a pork roast with sauerkraut and potatoes but the place is clearly positioned as a lunch and snack cafe as well and we're sure they do very well. Other reviews rave over the cakes, and I'm sure they are well worth it. The meal was different and delicious and the cafe is well recommended

Had bought the famous blackforest cake a year plus before. So decided to go to the restaurant to try the food. It was a lunch time and not crowded.It has been relocated into a hotel rather than a shop.Tried the set lunch came with free flow of bread and soup of the day. Was alright.Main courses were Jumbo burger with fries (deep-fried chicken cutlet) and quarter spring chicken and crispy pork belly companying with steamed rice and black sweet chili sauce.Burger was big portion but dry. Quarter chicken also like dry. Crispy pork belly and sweet black chili sauce were the only alright thing.Dessert was the famous blackforest cake but looked smaller than before and sweeter. The taste afterall was still good.House dark beer was good
4
When we step into the cafe, it feels like we are in Germany. The interior is well designed. On weekdays, go for the lunch sets as it is cheaper. You can order the blackforest cake ala carte separately.On Mondays, they have a 1c for each ml promotion on beers.You should go there at least once if you like to have a feel of Germany without breaking the bank

We came for a birthday celebration. Food Portion is small n food is average. So the only thing we all like are the black forrest cake! :)A cozy place to hangout with limited staff.Oh no complimentary ice water to serve you too! That's a shame
3
Probably, that is the reason why it is called as a Cafe instead of a restaurant, we ordered a sausage platter, salad, and pork knuckle to go with our beer.The portion of sausage and knuckle is relatively small, unlike other German set up in the country.Before we go, we have ordered the Blackforest Cake, "claimed" to be the best, and it tasted very good, this is probably the highlight of the cafeBeer selection is alright, but I will prefer to have more choice of stronger beer

I was craving a bit of German cuisine so decided to stop in here with my hubby. The decor and ambiance is very kitsch but I enjoyed it for what it was. The German beer was cold and delightful. However our pork knuckle was drying out which was disappointing.

Went with some friends to have dessert and some drinks. As always when I see "bread pudding" I must try it. It is a lot better than most of the bread puddings I've tried of late except that it had apples slices it in - which wasn't my cup of tea. Overall it was quite good and the ice cream was a good choice with the bread pudding. My friends had their signature black forest cake and there seems to be no complains from them. Maybe I'll go back and have dinner there soon.The staff are pretty friendly as well

Main Course: taste is mediocre, tried the sausage and pork knuckle. You can basically get the same thing anywhere. Very disappointed with the food served. Took a long time for the food to be served. We tried to be understanding thinking that it could be due to crowd. When the food came it was not even hot.Desert: again the black forest cake can be better.Service: Within expectation. They gave us complimentary garlic bread. (We did not complain or gave any feedback,it was served to us for no known reason.)Ambience: nice setting. it was the setup and ID of the restaurant enticed us to give it a try. Nice place to have a drink.Overall: if you plan to have a feast on pork knuckle, bratwurst etc, this is not a good place to do so
