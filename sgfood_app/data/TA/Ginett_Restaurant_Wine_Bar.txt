Been here a few times and even though couldn’t get dinner the perfect place for a glass of wine. Service friendly and they have an insane amount of wine glasses!
5
Great service by Bell! She was really friendly and genuine. Enjoyed my first time at Ginett tonight :)
5
Ordered a cheese board with some pâté and I loved every bit of it. The food was amazing and the wine was cheap and good. You can't go wrong with this place basically.
5
It's my second time here and it's excellent every time. Great food and vibe on day time or night time.

We saw the bar accidentally during walking around, was attracted by amazing deco, and decided to drop by for a dinner . It was Friday and they were Super crowded , so I think it’s better to make a reservstion... but even though, So packed the staff was so helpful and arranged a nice seat for us. Since it’s a French resto, we decided to go French and ordered a duck confit Niçoise salad and the burgundy snails as entre. Snail a bit small but tasty, classic nice Niçoise with generous amount of fresh tuna , duck confit was delicious as well, but the best part was dessert!! A home made profiteroles was melting in the mouth and will always stay in our heart

One of my friends bring me to this bar during my visit to Singapore last week. We loved how casual and fun the atmosphere is , we tried a lot of different wines. kudos to a great wine selection and affordable prices! And btw, the music there is nice and funky. I suppose it's not fair is I finish the review without mentioning the friendly staff members. The guys there were welcoming and the service was fantastic...would definitely go agai

Been there for late dinner few times. Restaurant is busy and crowded despite the late hours.. very good ambience and friendly and helpful staff..The food is very yummy... we tried their oysters (very fresh and very meaty) and had the beef cheek and beef tartar as a main course, one of their staff helped us to pick the wine from a huge wine list to pair perfectly with our food... The staff is very friendly and took care of us very well. we enjoyed our evening and definitely will come back.

It has been awhile since we ate here. We had positive food and wine experience when we came.Tonite was an off nite. I ordered my favourite wagyu beef cheek dish. I informed them that it was too salty. They gladly replaced it. The second plate came and likewise still salty. I assumed they came from the same batch since it is slow cooked dish and they came back with new plate after less than 10 minutes. I informed them it was salty again.They suggested I order a different dish instead. I asked for the sea bream (see photo) and it was very good. And they did not charge me - an excellent way to keep a customer to come back after the bad experience.Their focus on customer delight makes up for the “off” dish. We will be back

My elderly dining companion and I waited patiently for our orders to be taken as it was the peak lunch hour. We each ordered a main - 1. Charcoal Cheese Burger - patty was over cooked and the service staff who took our order didn't bother asking for the doneness, so we assumed it was left to the chef's good hands and usually burger aficionados would agree that the doneness would be medium rare to medium well2. Baked Salmon Back - Delicious, the sauce went very well with the fishWhen we were almost done with mains and ordered another round of house white and house rosé, I asked Michael, who took our orders, what do guests need to order to get served bread. This question was posed because we were not served bread - we can understand since lunch service was busy and they could have forgotten - and Michael immediately answered,' We can serve you bread now. If you want it now, we can serve you now. You want bread?! ' Clearly, they have forgotten to serve our table bread, and all he had to do was mention that they had missed our table. We had already finished our mains, why do we want bread? We overheard Michael telling a group of guests that Ginett is a french restaurant. We laughed at the irony of what he had said. Serving a basket of bread at your table is one of the most admired dining traditions in France. We were not slighted that they had forgotten to serve us bread, because if we had wanted it badly, we would have asked for it (although I suspect we would need to raise our hands for at least 5 minutes before someone would come to us). Michael's response to us was what left a bitter taste in our mouths to an otherwise relatively delicious lunch. Although he knew we were not too happy, we had to wait at least 15 minutes before our bill came. I had to raise my hand to get his attention, and his reaction told me he knew what we wanted and that he had forgotten about our bill. Whilst waiting for our bill, the podium facing the big entrance behind my seat knocked onto my chair. There was a staff who was standing there doing some work, and while she knew I had turned back to check what had bumped into my chair, she simply jerked the podium away from me - the whole time looking down at the book or paper or whatever she was looking at, without an apology. In fact, she had a scowl on her face. The food is good but not good enough to make one go back to suffer the terrible service staff. I would not recommend this restaurant but I believe everyone can improve, hence I wouldn't mind giving this place a chance again, maybe a year later, if service improves

I first heard about Ginett through the grapevine; an Italian friend had gushed about the food and wine selection there and I had made a mental note to check it out if ever I was in the Bugis area. Then, a French colleague made a comment about it being an authentic French restaurant which she had had a great experience at. After following their social media pages and being tantalized by the regular posts featuring very attractive spreads, I finally had the pleasure of dining there with colleagues from work a month ago - it was a Wednesday night and I had to change my reservation for 3 pax to 6 pax, 15 min from the time of reservation. I walked in and was surprised to see it was a full house. The ambience was welcoming; high ceilings and low lighting make for a killer combo for a kind of laid-back cool vibe that people in the know seem to dig. The manager Guillaume was thankfully able to accommodate my last minute tweak to reservation despite the full house (there was a 2nd floor where a private space had been booked by a social media influencer for her personal year end party).I recall the wine list was extensive but as we were not in the mood for alcohol that evening, we turned our attention to the food menu instead. For our party of 6, we ordered a few items for sharing and everyone was impressed with the food. My colleague visiting from Los Angeles complemented me on the choice of restaurant and said the cote de boeuf we shared was one of the best he had ever tasted. I have since gone back several times to have drinks as well as meals and the food has never disappointed. Without diving into too much detail and letting the photos do the talking instead, the stand-outs for me from the menu were:• 1 meter cheese board• cote de boeuf• quenelle (pike fish)• poached eggs meurette• duo foie gras• beef tartare• mac & cheeseLet the staff know your requests for an occasion and they'll set you up nicely; be it a fun seat for 1 at the bar (Adil makes a great cocktail based on your preferences), a place where you can plug in your laptop to work at upstairs on the 2nd floor or, a date night in a plush and intimate booth seat upstairs - at Ginett it's all about personable service and having a good time. This is one establishment that I hope continues its winning formula in Singapore

We enjoyed our dinner here , lovely food , great presentation , good staff and the restaurant itself is lovely, Portions were a little on the small side . Good cocktails , mocktails and wine
5
we loved it ! the interior, the atmosphere, the food, just everything ! a mixture of tourists and local business men/woman.

Praising french food in Singapore would be a bit OTT. But this place is actually very good given how far this Frenchmen traveled to open Ginett. Not everything is perfect but they are already very good. Minor glitches could be excused.The food is pleasant and wines of very good quality are available.And all this executed and delivered by outstanding staff. Most friendly, knowledgeable and true hospitality professionals on all levels. I watched the operation and was very impressed. Will comes back for sure! You should do too
3
This is a nice location / ambience etc and as I was staying at the hotel I dropped in to try the wine. There seems to be a very unfounded perception that “if it’s French it’s good”. I had a glass of the Chablis (poor), the Pinot Noir (very average) and the Pic Saint (bit better). If I lived locally it would not be a regular haunt. Thanks
4
Very French restaurant. Great atmosphere even better services.The food was delicious. We only took a three feet board of French salami, jambon crue, and cheeses.The menus offer a wide array of traditional French dishes. Manager Guillaume will make sure you have an unforgettable time.Great selection of wine
5
This is truly one of our favorite places in Singapore. We stopped in by chance one time several months ago for a drink, and now it's a normal hang-out spot. The wine is outstanding in quality and price. We're a huge fan of their bar-bite menu. We highly recommend the G-board, which comes with bread in its purest form! The service is something that keeps us coming back. Their staff knows the menu in and out, they know how to treat customers ( this is something we find rare in Singapore). No stay in Singapore of any length is complete without visiting this place.
4
Had a great lamb shank. Also a steak which was ok. Very cool place to go with great music. Nice open planned space with upstairs and outside area. Service was very friendly and on the money. Good place to go for both a drink and a meal
5
Food and service was really good. My friend ordered the steak and the portion is perfect, we can even share, the food taste amazing and the price is reasonable. The service was quick and the staff was really friendly and helpful.The restaurant is so pretty with little details. Definitely recommended and will be back again for sure
4
Called in for just a drink and found great atmosphere happening. Great wine list very reasonable . The beers are expensive and only 2 choose from, but as the manager commented to us they are focussing on French wines. The bar menu very good and good value. Would definitely go back again
2
Not sure how I convinced myself to be back a second time, but this is certainly the last. The 2 course lunch set at $18 sounds like a great deal until you receive the food. Portions for the mains were so small, you would most definitely need an afternoon snack. The taste was very ordinary, nothing to shout about.Would recommend ordering ala carte if you want a filling meal.
5
Great place for food and drink. Super social with amazing atmosphere. Food quality is the best what I have tried so far in Singapore! Will come back for sure again !!
5
This spot is super cool.
Nice music nice outfit
Excellent food and service ok
Quality for money restaurant in Singapore you cannot except better one.
We ate a lot and paid very reasonable
Worth paying a visit
5
try the octopus and the 5 cold cuts and 5 cheese's and you'll be back for more . i did and returned 5 times. great meals at reasonable prices.
5
We stayed for lunch and ordered a homemade lemonade and two different sandwiches. You could add as much or little sugar to the lemonade as you liked, which we found great. The sandwiches were especially delicious, both came with a side of salad and baked potatoes and very generous portion of a sandwich! Cheese tasted great, too.
5
We did not make a reservation and just popped by for lunch. The staff were very accommodating and opened up the mezzanine level just for us, reminding us to watch the steps. Although it was a drinking place, we didn't order wine and the staff did not show any sign of displeasure. We were served warm bread while waiting for our food. We had a not your usual cheese burger which came with large portion of potato wedges, and a very interesting breakfast with in-house campagne bread. Really like the place with the high ceiling and high windows, it makes you feel like you are overseas. It definitely qualifies in decor magazines. The traffic outside is a reminder that you are still in Singapore.Most items are below S$20 and you get a nice ambience as well
5
Visited mid week on recommendation of someone who eats here regularly. Really helpful staff and very friendly. Had the G board - a sharing platter with meats cheese etc which was good followed by a rib eye. Steak was great quality and reasonable price. A decent bottle of cote du Rhone was $50 and excellent value for Singapore. Our dinner was 6.30 so early- by he time we left about 830 the place was very lively and had a really good vibe. 5 stars because I didn't feel ripped off by the wine price!

Saw a waiter used his hand to taken the baguette from the kitchen hand. Then he used his hand to cut the bread. Then used his hand to pick the bread to put in the bowl. What's the point? Overall great food and ambient and great service. Good is good and price reasonable. Just the incident that put me of
2
I guess the title says it all and I generally try to be positive with reviews but this was an awful experience today. Service was patchy. Took ages to order a drink, nobody checked how the food was and had to wait about 5 minutes to pay the bill.There appears to be too much focus on appearance and not enough on the quality of the food. I had the Carbonara which at $22 was really bad value. The spaghetti did not feel hiome made. Tiny portion presented with a fairly well poached egg on top. Not sure what it was doing there to be honest. I've had raw yolk on Carbonara before which works really well but this was just soft egg white with a well done yolk. No offer of Parmesan etc. Ended up leaving feeling hungry having paid $44 for Carbonara and a beer. Get real

We were looking forward to a couples' night out and thought we might check out Ginette after walking past a couple of times. I had made a reservation under my name - my partner arrived first and was told that our table was not ready and he was shown to another table to wait. He was handed a menu without any greeting. When I arrived, I had to ask them if we were going to be shown to a new table as the restaurant was very empty. A rather brusque service staff replied, "no". We decided to order some drinks and a cheese plate. For the lack of crowd, there was clearly too many wait staff but they were all hard to engage for some reason. I asked for cheese recommendations, and an inexperienced staff gave my the most general comments and i had to tell her to bring a more knowledgeable colleague. A China national who looked like he had to come out of the kitchen rather impatiently gave me some choices, and we decided quickly as we were hungry and didn't want to create a further fuss. The food was very mediocre, and NO ONE came to check on us during our dinner. We also ordered a Wagyu Beef Cheek penne which was lukewarm and the beef was tough. Meanwhile, most insultingly, the table behind us was engaging in very pleasant conversation with the caucasian manager about their holiday and their food. After our food, someone came to top up our water and i said i didn't want more water, at which she walked away without offering my partner the water. When i finally asked for the bill, it was presented without further conversation. We paid and left - feeling insulted, invisible, and full on very mediocre food. As we were walking out, we noticed that most of the diners were caucasians and the wait staff were certainly providing decent service to them. This was probably the worst dining experience we've had in years in Singapore. We will very firmly never come back here

We first wanted to go to Ginett because of the design of their wonderful dining room!After having seen the menu we were extremely excited: there is so many things looking amazing that we didn’t know what to chose!But big disappointment when we saw the size of our dishes/garniture... the worst was our beef tartar! So small.. for $28 we were expecting à proposer size..At the contrary, our desserts were almost “too big”.. something wrong in this...Taste wise, everything was just so so, nothing excellent unfortunately!Finally, and for us it’s important.. the service is a disaster! Our waiter was not friendly at all, was not able to dress our table properly (we had to ask every minute for one more thing missing..), he didn’t have us one menu per person, no drink menu, no dessert menu... Ginett was not bad, but not a place where we imagine to go back clearly.

Pros
(1) nice decor
(2) yummy cheap wines
Cons
(1) food not very good. Beef cheeks was too salty. Can get better fried at McDonald's
4
Affordable wine, nice place and staff. Food portions are small though for the price.
So you will end up spending a significant amount if you're ordering sides or multiple dishes.
4
I was pleasantly surprised by both the selection and price of the wine available here. Plenty of wines available for around $8++ a glass (which is very reasonable in Singapore). It's perhaps for this reason that it's quite a popular venue. Worth another visit.

My partner and I strolled in for dinner on a Saturday night. We loved how the placed looked and was therefore keen to give it a try.Food - good variety, with specials on the blackboard. Suffice to say, there is something for everyone. Food service was prompt, serving size was reasonable. Food was yums!! Though a little heavy handed on the salt on some dishes. We had the bone marrow, ribeye steak and cod fish.. we polished everything off our plates, and would gladly have those dishes again. We've had lousy steaks even at places known for them, so we were very happy that our medium rare here was done just right. There was also an extensive, reasonably priced, wine list.. we like ;-)Ambiance- a little noisy at times, but there was a laid-back chill and comfy feeling to the place.Service - their service definitely contributed to our lovely evening. We were served mainly by Dhruv, Irene and Margo. Even when the place was full, water and wine glasses were being filled, service was prompt and attentive, and we enjoyed the light hearted conversations we had with them.We look forwards to coming back, and have already recommended Ginett to our friends
5
Came here after our lunch and shopping. Ginett Restaurant certainly looks sharp with their distinctive bar counter, giant poster and huge menu boards all put together to make us take a double look to walk in and see what is nice there. Menu was presentable & many choice & since we had a full lunch, we tried their cheese platter & macaroni n cheese with bacon. Will visit again for it's a relaxed place to catch up & chat. 
5
I really enjoyed our meal for brunch here. I believe prices are reasonable for the quality of the food. Service is correct and friendly. I specially enjoyed the onion soup, it was wonderful. The main dishes were good but not fantastic, and finally the profiteroles were not the "classic" but still delicious. Overall a great experience
2
After seeing so many great reviews, we were really excited to eat here but was disappointed. Nice atmosphere and well priced wine, however the service we received was very disappointing. The staff were dismissive and not attentive e.g. would walk away mid question, each time we asked to order, they pointed to someone else for us to ask, errors with our orders, and dessert was just put in the middle of the table then waiters walked away. Main meals and dessert were standard but for the price you pay, we expected more. Nice place for a wine and cheese platter (the cheese is delicious), however would rather spend the money elsewhere for food
3
My medium rare was closer to a rare than medium rare but was too hungry to send it back. Creamy spinach fab. Loved the g board- wonderful cheeses n great presentation . Loved the ambience.Sugggestion to have more choices of full bodied red 1 think there's only 2-3 listed in menu. Overall decently priced , i think I might return . I think you guys can go from average to very goo
4
Good food, good service and a great location. Have a drink with bar snacks or a meal with wine from a comprehensive wine list. Cocktails are also available. My only negative comment is the tables are very close together so if someone with a loud voice is seated close by it can interfere with your ability to converse easily with your companions
3
Went for a bday dinner with some friends! We shared a meter board of cheese and cold cuts and took 2 bottles of wine + a meal each and end up with a bill of SGD 600 for 7 pax! The service deeply needs to be improved.Nice place though :) I would recommend this place for wine and cheese kind of dinner.
5
I came here on Aug 11 with 2 friends as suggested by one of them. Fantastic burger, inexpensive set lunch, high end Parisian bistrot quality and outstanding service. Moreover the 100% french wine list is outstanding even by the glass and SO INEXPENSIVE. I had to share that with my Wife so I returned on sat 12th Aug with Wife and kids 3 and 7 for lunch. On weekends, they propose a 42 dollar brunch that comes with so many dishes that we didn't order as we could. And they allowed us to share some with the little ones so it only cost us a few dollars for the juices and so on. We tried the côté de bœuf (only +60) which was perfectly prepared, like in any posh Parisian brasserie. And we paired this with multiple glasses or wine ranging from 6 to 15. After 13 years in Singapore I finally know a place where I can have a week day or weekend lunch like in Paris and at the price I'd pay in Paris. And the team at both times was friendly and very professional. Remarkable.I might have found my new favourite place now that absinthe closed.
5
Found this wonderful restaurant by chance. Toby restaurant manager was delightful and willing to spend time with us. After having a glass of wine we stayed to enjoy a most delicious meal. The service was excellent and the Chief barman was a delight. We will return on our next trip. Thanks Toby. [ ex Perth ]

We dined at Ginett on a Wednesday evening and the place was full by 930pm, a popular venue. Fairly loud music and a mixed bar/restaurant atmosphere gave a buzz. We shared the pate en croute and had la joue bouef and scallops (special) with a glass of wine each. Nicely presented and well cooked, the food was excellent. Service was good although a little erratic and inattentive at times. Pricing was slightly on the high side but this might be the norm in Singapore. Ginette's informality and dining options reminded me of some places in Melbourne, albeit with more of a French accent. Recomended
4
I've been to Ginett twice since its doors opened in February 2017 and left longing for the next return. The ambience and service at this busy restaurant is vibrant - good for a fun night out.The drink list has good selection and the menu has a hearty deliverance. Really want to visit again soon
5
We stopped on the way out to dinner for a drink as we had seen this bar evolving over the last six months. Great job on the decor, ambience and service. The bar stools are comfortable and the place is nice and cool, even though it is open to the street. They have a great selection of wines at great prices, but the beers are a little pricey. They were making cocktails and serving bar snacks, which looked great. They have meals, but we were too early to see these coming out. Will be back.
5
It's a place that we spent the first night in Singapore for a glass of wine. We enjoy the night, talk & drink & plan what we will doing in Singapore. You know some bar is really nice but you can't talk each other because of their noisy but here are not, u can talk with your friend for the whole night. Moreover it is a nice place to take photo. Yes we are photo lovers.
5
Visited the place on a Friday (had to book in advance - as they get packed). The whole setting/atmosphere is spacious, airy - high ceiling, wide space for walking too, glass windows floor to ceiling. So it was good!The food -- I love the 1M cheeseboard, it's really value for money, more than 10 of cold-cuts and cheese combined. It's good for 3 to 4 people. I also loved the Quenelle Brochet we ordered. The wine selection is also good. I am not a wine expert but my friend is, and so my friend was the one who chose the wine. It was Hautes Ouche and what's the best part is that, a bottle of wine only costs SGD30! The staff are attentive and friendly too

I am currently staying at the hotel for the rest of the week, and hope the service will improve and the hotel will not give me another reason to write a negative review. What happened? This afternoon I walked into an empty Ginett Restaurant with my wife and another couple and asked for a table for four - for drinks only. Was abruptly told by a caucasian, blond lady, that they are fully booked. She right away pointed at the bar and told us we could only sit there. Ok, so we are two couples, not a bunch of guys, thus we found a decent conversation impossible at the bar where we had to sit all right next to each other. I looked around at the empty place and then told her, that we are in-house guests, will only have one round of drinks and would prefer a table. With lots of convincing from my end and an unhappy face on her end, the lady then finally walked us to a high-stool table (pretty much the worst table at the restaurant, hidden behind a pillar). No problem. We ordered our round of drinks and here we go: A large hair in my friend's wife's drink. We exchanged the drink, finished our round and left within an hour. The lady, who gave us the table never bothered once to come to our table or ask if everything was alright, except when she brought the new drink, that we had exchanged due to the hair - but she did not even offer an apology and just placed the drink on the table with no comment at all, not even a smile. After we left, three hours later we passed by again - and you guess it: Plenty of tables still empty, including the one we initially had requested but were denied. If Hotel G really thinks their staff can be so arrogant and incapable, then you can bet, that we will never return. We are done with their Ginett Restaurant and will see how the rest of our stay goes..
5
Made for those who like good french food, cold cuts and mains like duck confit, tartare, beef cheek, ....Service is not always fantastic but food is great and cold cut is abondant and wine is selected with care is cheap and delicious. Good choice to enjoy with friendsHighly recommended
3
Always find the place crowded with expats or tourists, so I went with higher expectations I suppose. Service was great, they were happy to recommend the lunch sets and were attentive. The setting was nice with a wine bar (pity I couldn't drink at lunch). I had the 2-course lunch, opting for a minestrone soup and seabass. The soup was decent but I found the vegetables that came with the seabass way too salty. I finished the seabass but left most of the vegetables untouched.I would maybe come back for dinner, for wine, or to watch people passing by
5
Popular hangout for the local expat community. Reasonable selection of wine (considering the wine drinking culture is new in Singapore). The cuisine is largely French-influenced. Good friendly service.
4
Real good find. Space was modern and hip. Most of the tables were reserved.Decent French merlot @ $7 a glass. Loved the beef Cheek simmered for 12 hours. Pasta was also very good. Asked for smelly cheese and needed to ask for a replacement before getting good smelly cheese! Baguette was good as well.Certainly coming back with the family
3
I love this venue - the design looks beautiful. I do wish the service could match up to its good looks. Its service staff lacks interest, initiative and is mired in inertia. You step in, the staff looks at you for a brief moment before looking away. The welcome comes in the form of a slight (physical) brush as they walk past you. There was only one member from the staff team that was willing to show me to available seats at the bar. Needs some work
4
It was my first "discovery" visit and I like the high ceiling and was amazed by the 1 Meter cheese board (especially the reasonable price). The fresh and warm bread served with the cheese board was really nice .The French wine selection is quite good. Btw, the nice high ceiling is a rare sight for SG restaurants and bars, and it gives the place a more relaxing touch .P/S: My friend and I walked in at 715pm mid-week, and it was packed. Reservations are recommended
3
We have been there several times since the opening and it is a shame because prices are really correct but they often forget something (a dish, a drink...)The food is correct but sometimes it arrives cold...The staff is pleasant but that is not enough.They should care more about their service and kitchen.The decor is great and the location as well
5
Great wine selection. Lots of atmosphere. First visit was for wine. Went back for the food. Ended up sitting at the beautiful and vibey bar again at own request, although they had a table in the dining area available. The food was great and the service excellent
5
I love oriental food as much as anyone. But once in while have a craving for a simple European meal with an excellent Bordeaux. Well this is the best I have found in Singapore to date. The cheese and cold cuts boards are good. The salad Nicosia was excellent. Now for the reason one is here - the wine. Hard to get a good wine at a reasonable price in Singapore from France. But the wine selection is good and the prices are lower than at London restaurants. For example, the Pontesac 2010 at 110 singapore dollars. Ok it is a bit young but starting to show all its promise. The 2008 Ch. Beau Site at 90 dollars was also good for what was a challenging year. Been there twice in less than a month and plan to continue. The wines are better value than at 13% Bistro. Finally, had three desserts - creme brûlée, profiteroles, and a berry gratin - Could not find anything to complain about them
5
Me and my friends went for a dinner at Ginett and we ordered Spring Chicken comes with a truffle mashed potatoes..... that was the best mashed potatoes that I have ever had for years and spring chicken is just nicely-roasted. The music was great. And thank you Tarek for your hospitality and I'm really happy to meet you again, my friends and I had a wonderful time in the restaurant
3
3 & half star rating - Went there for dinner and had a decent experience overall. Had a selection of cheeses as well as a selection of mains and desserts. Worth the price paid. Would recommend for a casual simple expectations type place but not for any special occasion or high quality grub. Service was touch and go with some servers providing exceptional service and others were barely there
5
This place is a real gem! I had lunch here and walked away super full and satisfied with the meal. Had poached eggs with merguez, eggs Benedict, waffles with ice cream. The quality was great, the service was amazing and the price is phenomenal. I will recommend this place in a heartbeat
4
Fun place, pretty good selection of food, very good wine selection. Pricing was reasonable, service fine.
5
Absolutely friendly place with waiters competing for your attention and service. Teak wood ambiance around tables, bar and stair cases. Light music. Food presentation excellent, simply great ingredients, and all tastes superb! Thanks, will be back soon!
5
Ever since our first visit a month ago we have been back at least once a week. Glass of wine for 6 dollars, awesome eggs for breakfast or cheese board in the evening. Never disappointed. But the standout of this place is the amazing staff; friendly, professional and always do their best to accommodate us. Top restaurant bar
5
On a business trip to Singapore, I have been recommended by friends to go to Ginett. The atmosphere, the music, the décor everything is right. From the person who welcomed us at the entrance to the warm goodbyes from The waiters, everyone was lovely and happy to serve us. To my surprise the quenelle which tasted just like in France and the profiteroles were amazing. Margot made our evening memorable, spent time to recommend the wine, the dishes and ensuring everything was going smoothly. I will definitely come back next time I come to Singapore 
5
I had a very pleasant evening dinner with my friends at Ginett and we highly recommend it! I order the tartare from the menu...it was succulent and typically French. The service was also good with a charming and careful staff. They have an incredible list of wine at a decent price! We were not able to decide which one to choose but Miss Margot gave us excellent advice about the wines. She made our choice easier and was always there to assist us. I will definitely go back again during my next trip to Singapore, it's one of the best place in town!

We booked a table for 20:45 à Friday evening and we've been asked to be on time because they wouldn't keep the table if we're late. Fine, we came on time and the table wasn't ready, we had to wait more than 45 mins! The manager offered us a glass of wine to wait, which was appreciated.We've looked around while waiting and we've noticed many dissatisfied customers complaining about mistakes in the dishes or too long waiting.Finally, when we had a table, we've ordered and the waiting was indeed very long and I have to say that the risotto that was served was the worst ever, the rice was overcooked. Tasting more like congee than like risotto. They've probably cooked a big pot for the complete service and serving on demand.Because of the long serving time, when we came to dessert, the waiter told us it was too late for dessert! But finally another waiter took over and managed to get us dessert.The service is probably still in a ramp up phase but definitely not at the right level, at least now..

I was really hoping for more. The location has a great vibe, with the front area open to the sidewalk. I really liked the music too: modern and upbeat. Those are the best things I could say about it. One thing that sets them apart is they import their own wines from France so I figure you should be getting great value, right? I went by-the-glass and tried a chablis and the Roubine rose, the rose was the better of the two. At $7 per glass this was a good value for sure, the Chablis at $14 was not great and neither was the Carillon cab at $11. Not that they were bad, just not great and not any impressive price either. For the food also it's not that anything was bad. We tried the tuna tartare, the baby chicken, and the beef cheek. The tuna tartare was possibly the best followed by the chicken. The chicken smelled amazing and the flavor was really good too but my wife thought it was a bit dry. The beef cheek wasn't as tender as you'd expect and the saucy stuff it was cooked in was pretty good, just not great. The mashed potatoes that accompanied both the beef cheek and the chicken were uninteresting. The potato wedges that came with the tuna were good and the fish was tender and fresh. Others have complained about the service, and I think they've been working on this. It was slightly difficult to get their attention and they weren't the most knowledgable--I would expect a place that highlights their wine to have staff that could have a better knowledge of what's available and be able to make recommendations. Also their pino noir by the glass was not available. Not available? Why not use a different bottle to sell by the glass. For a "wine bar" you've got to do better. The staff was certainly friendly and enthusiastic, yes, but they need to be more knowledgable and keep a better eye on the customers

The set up is great and creates a decent atmosphere Service strongly depends on who you get on your table and the managers are good and the rest so soFood totally depends on understanding what you want and understanding the offeringE.g. The burger is French style and if you like that excellent ! Wines are the big plus and v reasonable Recommend a visit and the bar really pumps later week evenings

It was full when I went for lunch with a friend. Passed by a few times since it was opened and seeing that it was full every time I walked pass, decided to give it a try. Had the pork belly and was not impressed with it. The taste was bland, the mash potato it was sitting on also had no taste. Would prefer the skin of the pork belly to be crispy but unfortunately it was too soft for my liking. May try the burger joint next door on my next visit to this area

Went for dinner this evening (after a long international flight) as we were staying in the hotel attached to the restaurant. In a relatively quiet restaurant (at the time) we were sat on the only table for 2 that was available, by the stairs to the hotel, nowhere near the rest of the restaurant. After being left there for 10 minutes with no drinks menu or anyone coming to see us we asked the front of house for a drinks many and were offered another table upstairs in an almost equally awkward location. After having the table water spilled everywhere out of the ridiculous watering cans we ordered our food. It was after the onion soups arrived my wine finally did which was a shame. The mains were fine, nothing special but tasted nice enough. The steak requires a couple of additional sides as the standard dish is very sparse. At no point did we get asked how our meal was or if we'd like another drink? I don't know if they serve deserts because again we were never asked if we'd be interested.... The service in this place was another level of poor and must be the main reason it's rated so low on tripadvisor.

We really enjoyed our dinner there with authentic traditional French dishes that are not overpriced and affordable French wines which is not so frequent in Singapore.
Staff is really welcoming and friendly
We had a really nice evening there and we will be back

Delicious food and great wines at extremely reasonable prices. Add a wonderfully vibrant atmosphere and you have one of Singapore's latest "must try"s. For us that "must try" is already a "will return".

Finally !! The perfect place for drinks, snacks or dinner in this area ! The open door setting, gorgeous interior, music, fabulous wine (so reasonable) and tasty food make for a place you just want to come back to - with friends, on a date or on your own ! The French manager, Margot, took special care to recommend drinks, food and was attentive and helpful - fabulous experience!

Went to Ginett two weeks ago and received one of the best service from Santos. We came without reservations for a party of 6 (it was also a last minute unplanned dinner). Santos was able to work around the seating arrangements to enable us to have a great time. Food was awesome although the steaks were alittle on the salty side (we will take note the next time). The wait staff were also very patient and helpful in addressing the demands of a large group which also included another 2 kids. Will definitely be back

I cannot rate this place high enough. I have been for dinner and also held a function here. Both times the service has been outstanding and the prices are more than fair. The food is delicious and the price of wine is very cheap for Singapore! I will definitely be returning!

The last time I was in Singapore this wine bar wasn't open yet. Since I usually stay within Bugis area, having a bar somewhere near is really a delight. I don't have to go to Orchard area to unwind. A bottle of wine costs as little as 30 sing dollars enough for a group of 5 to 6 persons. You can order the G Board - an assortment of cheese and cold cuts to go with your wine. For an additional 30 sing, your wine night with friends is complet
