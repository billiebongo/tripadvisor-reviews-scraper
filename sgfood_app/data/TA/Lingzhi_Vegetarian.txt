Food and Customer Service are excellent . Will revisit again. Highly recommended to visit this restaurant.
5
food quality is consistent. Variety is good and with many dishes that are pure mushroom based with no mock meat. Ambience is good too.
3
Food is tasty but portion is small. Still prefer the old menu.
Very convenient as level 5 car park is just next to the restaurant.

Great Food

Calm environment
great choices for vegetarian food

The food was amazing, definitely worth going back, reasonable price, but the service was abit slow, then again it was new year day and the Resturant was packed
4
Trying something new with all vegetarian dishes. Wanted to try a lot more but we were satisfied with what we ordered. The fried Hor fun was the highlight of what we ordered.
5
My 1st time in Lingzhi and I was amazed by how tasty the food was. We had the spinach roll as one of the starters and it was so full of flavour I wanted the savour every bite I took. All other dishes were great. Service was also very attentive. I would for sure return again.

If you are looking for quality and unique Chinese vegetarian dishes, look no further. The dishes here are quite innovative...the satay is an example. The horfun noodles was excellent. There are also dishes associated with yam that are cooked with other vegetables with sauces. They also serve wide selection of teas. Service is prompt and good too
4
Had been to the Novena outlet, but this was the first time at Liat Towers. The place seems more quiet, though it may depend on the time & day.Their vegetarian dishes come with a twist, different from the usual fare. Unfortunately, the sate looked better than it tasted, but the rest of the food was great.
4
Probably the most innovative vegetarian restaurant in Singapore. They have infused traditional Chinese vegetarian dishes with spices used in Indian cuisine. Eg. the breadsticks that are served with their mushroom potage which comes in stone claypots are infused with cardomom.Their vegetarian goose dish is presented a la Peking Duck style with steamed dough wrappers.Reservations are recommended especially on the weekends
3
Had read the reviews and expected some good stuff. The Duck-less Peking Duck were nice, so were the mushroom soup, the rest pretty so so. Not sure I would go here again.
4
the lingzhi restaurant is under tunglok group. the dishes are nice, but the serving time is too long for us ..
4
Friendly staffs and dishes on new menu taste good. But fried noodle is alittle salty for myself and family.
They are open to receiving feedbacks from diners.
5
Booking is required for this restaurant. The food was very well presented and the staff were pleased to assist us with our choices. Highly recommended for special or family occasions.

I've tried their 5-course set lunch in 2016 and it was absolutely delicious, substantial & great value for money. So I'm back again but the menu in 2017 has changed completely. The current menu is undoubtedly more refined but less substantial. At $25++ per person with a minimum 2 person order, we weren't full & had to top up by ordering one more dish, Braised Winter Melon Ring with 'Bai Ling' Mushroom, from the a la carte menu. Every dish was delicious except for the Singapore-style Chilli Sauce that accompanied the Crispy Rice Cake. The sauce was sorely lacking in flavour. Overalll, the food is tasty but it might appear bland for people used to lots of spices & MSG. But if you're into healthy eating and have a low tolerance to MSG like us, you'll really enjoy the meal. It might be a tad pricey but you get what you pay for. I would look forward to dining here again

We made reservation for 7 paxs on 1st Dec to celebrate a birthday. After ordering the dishes, the first dish was served 20mins . Subsequent dishes were served at average of waiting time of 15min per dish. Made request to expedite our orders. But not much action taken. We were told the food will come soon. In addition, there was not much of a crowd that night. Meant to be a celebration but waiting time was so long for each dish to be served. Very upsetting

I reviewed LingZhi last year and gave a fulsome account of my visits here spanning over a decade or more. My younger son is a vegetarian and has lived in Singapore for 15 years. This is his favourite everyday dining place and has now become mine too, even though I'm an ominivore.The sheer variety of dishes that I enjoy from hot and sour soup to monkey-head fungi is just a delight. I always eat too much here, but never learn!The atmosphere suits me also - restrained family buzz, not the tin-can racket some of the bigger, rowdier places emit - nice relaxing decor, attentive service all add up to a rewarding dining experience. Besides, you can park right at the door (high level in the parking building) no heat, no bustle getting there.I see there's another branch in Thomson Road - this review is for Liat Towers.Long may it cook
5
We ordered the 6 course set meal at $35++ per pax. It included some Lingzhi signature dishes such as Kale Broth in bamboo cup, Charcoal Beancurd & Sauteed Yam & winged beans to choose from for Soups & Mains. The new Crispy Rice cake with chili sauce is a must try. And as usual, the service crew were friendly and attentive.
5
Being a carnivore, I wasn't expecting much since this is a 100% veg restaurant. We went coz my mom is a vegetarian. I was pleasantly surprised coz everything from the veg char siew buns to the crispy tofu pancake wraps were absolutely delicious. They had a yummy crispy mushroom Dish as well. Mom loved the hot and sour soup too! Also the waitress was nice enough to tell us we were over ordering so we cut a few dishes and figured we could always order more if it wasn't enough, but it was perfect. We were so stuffed by the end of it so even one dish extra would have been too much
4
Tried a few dishes. The vege satay was not too bad but they had a fried bee hoon which was amazing. Just the right amount of oil to be fragrant and not too much to kill your taste buds. We had a few soups and they were good as well. Also had french beans, rojak, curry vege and they were good. The service was good but the restaurant could do with a little makeover. Looks really classy if they do it up a bit. Worth a second visit
4
Overrated but the food tastes good and fresh. Best place for vegetarians and vegans. The regular mock meats are quite different here and kind of fresh. A must try restaurant. My personal favorites was "Mushrooms".
5
Food is brilliant, I have been going here since I was a young child. A lot of options and great vegetarian food. Staff is very nice. Only thing that can improve is hr toilet. Overall a brilliant place.
5
We tried 3 Chinese vegetarian restaurants in Singapore, this was the best. We had one of the set menus for two. It was a little bit too much food, but delicious!
2
I personally don't like the food there. Although we ordered most of their popular dishes. Probably it's because they use better quality ingredients n doesn't put much MSG. It taste kind of bitter for me. Service is good though. The staff there will pro actively refill your glass. They approached us to sign up for their member card. It cost about SGD$20+ and it comes with about $20 credits in the card. We did sign up but, I will not visit the place again due to I don't like the taste of the food.

The interior of the resturant has deteriorated from my last visit a few years ago. The entrance is cluttered with unsightly objects and it looks like mom & pop stores. Not a positive first impression. As we are small eaters, 7 of us shared the $282++ 6-course set lunch for 6. However we paid an additional $70++ for extra person's soup & dessert, as the resturant refused to portioned these two items for an additional head count. They service the mandatory walnut and tea, to increase Check Average too. At the end we paid S$54 per head. The service is robotic, immediately after the Yu Sheng, the staff hurry to despatch four dishes simultaneously, without explaining what they are serving. The resturant was rather empty, yet the staff acted like they are eager to get rid of customers. The dishes were cold and definitely not a la minute. The taste are below average. Food looks like they had been scooped out of a big pot. Very disappointing that this is under the reputable TungLok group. We have a European guest, yet the person who service us do not understand and could not speak English. We have to asked twice for cut red chilli. Forget it
4
Love the concept of this restaurant, they don't provide mock meats which are full of artificial fillers, additives and very unhealthy. Instead, their dishes are prepared from fresh and natural ingredients. The food here was awesome and really good taste!We ordered the CNY special set meal for 2 pax (SGD54++ per person). Each dish was fantastic and came in good size portions. Would definitely come back for the famous monkey-head mushroom dish
3
Visited Lingzhi in the Liam towers at orchard. It's a tight little space with only round tables so they do not offer rectangular table for groups (there were 10 of us and we had to sit tightly on a round table). The food was just average; nothing spectacular.
5
As I mentioned in my review for the excellent Zi Zai (自在) under its old name of Forest Dew (which is what TripAdvisor lists it under), we're not vegetarians at all but enjoy Chinese vegetarian food. This was our first visit to Lingzhi. It was a different style of cooking - best described as "fine dining" - it was not the "mock meat" type of Chinese vegetarian cooking which I must confess I prefer, because there is an added element of fun in seeing how close the imitation comes to the real thing. However, we enjoyed our food, it was well cooked and tasty, with nice ambience and very good service. I should mention that the lunch cost for 3 was nearly 3 times that for dinner at Zi Zai for 5, but it was expected given the very different settings and cooking styles. All the dishes we ordered were excellent: black bean tofu and braised "monkey head " mushrooms (both specials not on the menu), watercress soup in whole coconut, golden lotus rolls, bean curd rolls, vegetarian duck (ok there was 1 "mock meat") and fried "hor fun" (flat rice noodles). We also had desserts: apricot with woods ears (really it tasted much better than it sounded), black sesame cream, and mango with sago. Plus Osmanthus tea. Yes we ate a lot - I know. What can I say? We like good food!The location we went to was in Liat Tower, not the one in Velocity (Novena). There was a quirk getting into the restaurant if you did not drive and park but walked in off Orchard Road to the "office building": the restaurant was on the 5th floor but only lifts 3 and 4 would go there. If you press the elevator button and lift 1 or 2 comes, you have to press one of the floor buttons to send the empty lift up, repeat until lift 3 or 4 comes - the very helpful security guard/receptionist showed us.All in all, nice experience and we had a good time talking to the servers as well.

I am a vegetarian. This is one of my favourite vegetarian joint. I am quite particular about the vegetarian food I eat as I don't like fried food or mock meats and Lingzhi serves very good and healthy vegetarian food. The quality is good and price is affordable. Ambience is good too. I must also comment that the service staff is good too. Have patronize them since the early 2000s. Great place.

After recent experience of uudam in our hometown of Hanoi, we went to Lingzhi as it was recommended by friends. Good but often a bit too spicy for my western taste and for my Vietnamese family. We were recommended to try the brain mushroom which was the closet thing to meat I have had in a begat arisen restaurant and was succulent and good but with lots of chili. Other dishes came in a set menu which was a good variety, including noodles and a Thai salad with seaweed. The service being Chinese was somewhat perfunctory, but you get used to that - it's not meant to be unfriendly
4
This restaurant is more of a fine dining one. When we read the good reviews we decided to give it a try. Note the curry and rice quantity is pretty good, hence, the so called small size is pretty filling.
4
One of the few Veg options for those wanting to try Chinesse cuisine in singapore.
Located on Orchard road this has great preparations and decently priced. A meal for 4 adults costs about s$100.
Must try for vegetarians .
5
This is a completely vegetarian restaurant serving exquisite chinese. Its a must go for food lovers-including meat lovers.
5
We opted for a la carte.. We loved the food... Had brown fried rice, noodles and a veg main course.. The starter was also tasty...
Service was slow.. And the staff wasn't attentive.. But good food and would recommend to vegetarians like me
4
Variety of food in buffet. Great service. Clean and good ambience. After eating with a very full stomach, many shops and malls along Orchard Road.
5
This is the first time I've experienced such nice quality vegetarian cuisine, will definitely be back in future. As for service, great job ladies ... 👍

Our vegetarian, Singapore-based son has been dining at LingZhi for more than twelve years, and we accompany him there when we're in town. Grandsons made up a party of six for dinner. Being in the Liat Towers, one can walk easily straight into the place directly from the L5 car park. It's not so easy to find off Orchard Road as one enters through a small ground-floor lift foyer, dog-leg shaped. You're in the right place when you see a dozing secuity guard at his station by the lifts.I really look forward to the wizardry that LingZhi does with veges. We have a traditional Chinese spread from dim sim through to mains and one does not miss the meat. My favourite is (revolting name) "monkey-head mushroom", dark cubes of firm textured fungus in a spicy sauce. To start, I had a tasty hot and sour soup.The service is that usual over-attentive table waiting found in top-class places. The staff uniformly smartly dressed and a maitre d' in a tux. Furnishings and decor very restful. Other reviewers have complained that LingZhi is expensive. Au contraire, as the host I paid just $S153 for six, including sc+tax. At $25.50 a head, that's great value for an Orchard Street white-cloth dinery
5
We went for the steamboat buffet. Infinite supply of amazing Dumpling/Momos, with a lovely spread of veggies. Who could have found a completely vegetarian restaurant in Singapore with such innovative and delicious food! It is conveniently located at orchard street MRT mall second floor. The dumplings had awesome stuffing in them and they were the softest that i had ever eaten. the steamboat topped with veggies of our choice was lovely. You could never go wrong with this kind of meal- even if you over-ate! Buffet for 2 cost $65, which is slightly expensive for that kind of restaurant- but it was worth it for the experience! Highly recommended and i am going there again when i am in Singapore next
5
Lingzhi is a well known vegetarian restaurant in Singapore. We may choose the steamboat or al carte dishes. I do not suggest steamboat because the food can be quite normal. Try their chefs signature dishes instead... Their claypot dishes all are very good.Price slightly on the high side.Service very good and very presentable to bring friends or business associates.
5
We struggled to choose as the menu had so many delicious sounding dishes. We accidentally tried to order too much and the staff very kindly advised, for example, that one rice was enough for two - it was more than enough! We were lucky to be there on an evening when there was a large birthday party for an 80year old which added to the atmosphere
4
We tried the vegetarian satay. It has dried beancurd, water chestnut, tofu, etc. nicely done, except that the satay sauce was too overwhelming. It would be better for the sauce to be served on the side.
5
This was my second time here. Service is great, and the food is also great. Lots of variety, so great for a big goup. The team there is very creative, so it's a flare on veggie food that's rare to find in America.
3
This is a place where you can get good vegetarian food. Prices are ok. Service is good. Ambience is typical Chinese restaurants.
3
We were looking for a vegetarian place specifically for dinner from TA and went here, it was rather tricky to find. the first job is to find Wheelock Place shopping mall as this gets you to the right side of the roads, then walk past the coffee club when you get to the road "angullia Park" turn left and then take the left into what looks like an office building it's on the 3 or 5th floor (forgot). Food was OK and actually quite strange (I suspect traditional Chinese in some respects) for the food and price I think I was quite expensive but waiter was really friendly.
5
We decided to do vegetarian for a change. Hardly a big fan of vegetarian food (in fact I love meat!) so expectations are minimum.It was rather difficult choosing what to eat. I mean the pictures on the menu all looks great, variety is great but in mind, it's all vegetarian... How diverse can the taste be? We decided to go with gut feel and ordered 3 different kinds of soup (single serving and for variety), appetizer and another 3 dishes. Firstly, I have to say all the 3 types of soup were fantastic! What was served didn't look like the picture and didn't look delicious. But boy! Just one spoonful and we were convinced we came to the right place. I'm almost salivating thinking of the soup now. The appetizer surprised us as the serving was bigger than the norm. We had salad mixed with fried mushrooms. Thumbs up.The yam ring and pumpkin dish - thumbs up too!It was also nice the service staff checked with us a couple of times if things were okay. Although the restaurant was almost full, they were attentive. I never had to ask for tea refill, it just keep coming. I'm already planning a next trip back to try the other dishes. All in all, we left this place very satisfied and happy!

As a vegetarian, it could be quite hard to find a vegetarian restaurant in Orchard Road. However, this Chinese Restaurant is an ideal place if you would like to have your dinner before you are going to shop in Orchard Road. The service was pretty good. It is a bit pricy if you are on a budget.
5
This review is purely for the takeaway. Restaurant ambience is really nice and staff are very responsive. Restaurant is very costly, but food I have not yet tried yet. The takeaway char siew pau and the dumplings, custard rolls, char siew pastry as well as spring rolls I must saw were all really tasty. The texture combined with the flavours are better than the ordinary outside restaurants. Although very expensive, food is really goo
5
My favorite was the Yee Fu noodles, came back the 2nd time because had the craving for it! The curry was abit too spicy for me (I can't take spicy food) and told the waitress if they can add water in it to make it less spicy but they prepared a new curry pot for us instead! great! and the bun which came w the curry was very nice and soft!
4
We always opt for lingzhi whenever we are craving for hotpot for family gatherings. A max of 2 different soup bases can be chosen for the hotpot: yam, herbal, tomyum. Its really filling and the veges on the counter are fresh. Theres dimsum at the side as well, with pau and etc
1
I was in Singapore on business and wanted to try a vegi buffet, I saw this place and traveled about 30 minutes by MRT to get there in Novena. I was very rudely told that in order to get a buffet dinner there that I would need a minmum of two people to do so. Where I come from buffett is open dining regardless of 1 or 100 people. This company needs to revisit their business plan especially for so solo travelers. I can not recommend this place
5
Probably, the better restaurant of Tung Lok comparatively to the other brands. Try the vegetarian dim sum. I think it's after 8pm, the dim sum will be sold at a discount.
5
Was surprised to see a veg steam boat restaurant. The soups were fantastic, so was the choice of veggies. The veg dumplings for starters were scrumptious and the dips were fantastic. Worth a visit if you are looking for something different.
5
I make sure I come to Ling Zhi every time I visit Singapore. The vegetarian food here is really exceptional, the food are always finely prepared and the service impeccable with attentive staff.There are actually two Ling Zhi in Singapore, same owners, different branch. One in Orchard area the other in Velocity @ Novena Square. Both equally good. They do make an effort to introduce new dishes every one and then as most diners are regulars!Yes the price can be slightly more expensive than average but you do get what you paid for, having been here many times, I have to say they do care about the ingredients they use and its definitely worth checking it out for both vegetarians and non vegetarians
5
This restaurant deserves the high rating it has, we have been twice in 5 days and on both occasions the standard of service and food was excellent. The second visit was on the evening of National Day and despite being fully booked, the food arrived promptly.I had the organic white aspargus soup which is a must have and then we shared a vegetable clay pot with Portuguese sauce and and eggplant with beancurd dish. These were accompanied by a brown rice with vegetables and truffles.All I can say is, please can we have a restaurant like this in Perth

This quaint highly rated vegetarian restaurant in the Orchard Road shopping district does a very nice job with local produce and with a Chinese flair. I've had two business dinners here and the quality of food is consistently high. Both occasions we've had the set menu (S$55 pax) which was 6 or 7 courses. The restaurant is primarily aimed at vegetarians but will veganize even the set menu when asked. They do serve beer but not hard liquor I'm told. We enjoyed fresh juices tonight. The building in which they are housed has been under construction for some time now. Hopefully they'll be done soon. Otherwise I may need to purchase a hard hat. Credit cards taken and reservations are suggested. Enjoy.
5
Came here for lunch after a morning of touring and sweating. Hard to find the entrance to Liat tower because of construction. All well worth the trouble. My wife had the organic white aspargus soup and I had the coconut herb soup with mushrooms. Both outstanding. We shared two dishes: the clay pot with mushrooms, chestnuts and snow peas with seitan was amazing. We also enjoyed the mushroom rolls. Yes, we like Chinese mushrooms. Finished with a pot of green tea. Yes, it is pricey, but traveling 9,000 miles to get here deserves a splurge. Coming back this week for dinner. For vegetarians (and non-vegetarians), this place is wonderful. Highly recommended.d th

I first ate at this restaurant 2 years ago. Choose this restaurant for a small family only ROM between the husband and I. We ordered a set meal for 2 tables. There are many different set meals to choose from. They knew that the special event was for an ROM and they cater a small table at the side for us when we were signing the papers. They served the meal right after everything was done. The private room fits 2 table. Now 2 years after, I came here again with the husband and my mother. This time instead of opting for a set meal we went looking around their ala carte menu. We ordered a few of the menu and the food was really really good. We particularly enjoyed the vegetarian satay. Even though the price of the meals in the restaurant may put some people off. However, the price does reflect the taste, value and the ambiance of the food and restaurant. Come here for a special event for a very special meal. It is worth it
5
We chose this restaurant for a special night out and it was fantastic. As others have said here, yes, it is more expensive than some other options - but in my opinion it was worth the extra $$$.Service was excellent. A man, who I took to be the manager, was very kind and was thrilled when I said we would give them a great online review. Food was delicious. I tried some new things and cannot complain about one bite.The location is a bit tricky. It is on the 5th (?) floor of a rather inconspicuous office building. With construction work going on at the bottom of the building, there are no obvious signs
5
Home: The menu is quite nice with lots of options. Really enjoyed the food. Service: We were served by Jeffery. He was really nice and took time to explain dishes and make suggestions. Very pleased with the service overall. Atmosphere: Nice comfortable seating. Nice tableware etc. No complaints. Only point is, if you're not looking to spend quite a bit, it's not the place for you. It's probably the most expensive Chinese vegetarian only restaurant in Singapore
3
You really have to want to go to Lingzhi, as it is very hard to find - on Level 5 of an office building without any sign. Lots of unusual dishes, all pretty good. The problems are the taste range is fairly limited, and many dishes are a bit too oily, starchy, or both. I also take issue with vegetarian restaurants which name their dishes 'duck, or worse 'shark fin' - it defeats the purpose of eating vegetarian. For better duck, I'd go to London Fat Duck at nearby Scotts Square. I would take my vegetarian guests back here, though. Attentive service
4
I eat food without roots and mushrooms, so this place was perfect. Very tasty and light vegetarian food, albeit heavy on the pocket.
3
The nice vegetarian concept of Chinese food, not like real. service was good and food is also good but quite expensive.
5
Had been to this restaurant with my business partnersa. Food was very delicious & had a new experienceb. Presentation of the food was very goodc. Staff was also very polited. Must of all Vegetarians in SingaporeCons:a. Price of dishes are a bit on higher side as compared to other chinese Vegetarian restaurants in Singapor
5
The restaurant is not romantic or beautifully decorated. The service and the food are very good. The fried food is not greasy and ingredients are very fresh. The bak choi with garlic is ok but the rest of our dishes are very nice and tasty.If I want to have Chinese vegetarian food, I will return again
5
Lingzhi serves delicious Chinese Vegetarian Food of great Variety . It is amazing how they match the taste , texture & some appearance of most of the well known Non Vegetarian Chinese dishes . Its mock meat dishes with almost authentic non vegetarian flavours can be easily mistaken as Non vegetarian ones . The Restaurant has very good Ambience & comfortable seating arrangements . Its location on 5th Floor gives it serenity & makes it absolutely noise free . Service is polite & fast 
3
Yes, we were surprised that they charged us for the peanuts that the waiter served when we sat down. We thought that the peanuts were complimentary and was not informed otherwise. Sneaky sneaky!We might not be going back. Not because of the food ('twas average) nor because of the service (the waiters were attentive). But because they sneaked out the 2 dollars peanuts charge without us knowing
1
Apart from a few of the dim sum, which are OK, the food here is really disappointing. Ordered a couple of noodle dishes and they were soggy and bland. One tasted of pine air freshener. Plus they bring boiled/stewed peanuts to the table whether you order them or not and then charge you for them, and the small bottles of "oxygenated" water are $4 each. What a con
5
I've only eaten here once, but I was very impressed. The best dishes we had were: 1) monkey brain mushrooms with dried chili, 2) mock duck appetizer, and 3) veggie fried rice. Our other dishes were also quite good, but not stand outs. The service was excellent.
5
Not easy to find on the 3rd (or was it 5th) floor. A colleague brought me there knowing me being Vegan. Staff was very helpful and friendly. They also took any special wish into immediate consideration: no almonds, vegan, no soy, ... So, although me not being easy to serve I had one of my best food experiences in Singapore. I will love to come back
4
The title of the review summed it all. Ling Zhi is your high-end chinese restaurant; for vegetarian food. Roasted duck, shark-fin soup, and satay (just to name a few) ring a familiar bell don't they. Except that they are all vegetarian. Service was good and the waitresses were all friendly.It felt that I was dining in an exclusive Chinese restaurant. The price could be slightly higher than your usual vegetarian fix in food courts but there is a saying that you get what you pay for. I was there on a weekday but the restaurant was quite occupied. I had some trouble looking for Liat Tower (because I am not a local) but once you find it just take the lift to the 5th floor
4
Googled for vegetarian restaurants in Singapore, and LingZhi name came out, and also after reading the good recommendation from Trip advisors writers decided to try out the place with a few friends and we loved the food served. We did not order the set menu but went for the a la carte and the dishes served were delicious. I was happy to see no mock duck, fish etc.. the vegetarian dishes were delicious and each had its own flavours unlike some vegetarian restaurants where most of the flavours tasted similar except for the different ingredients used.The spinach soup was smooth and tasted wonderful. We ordered many dishes and the one I liked best was the sautÃ©ed honshimeiji mushroom, asparagus and capsicum served in potato basket, a must try ! No alcohol served but the special drink (herbal ) that they offered tasted good.Service was good and the waitress were able to explain the dishes in the menu. The restaurant is situated in Liat Towers, Orchard Road
4
A chain of vegetarian Chinese restaurants in Singapore. We visited the one closest to Orchard Road. Very basic decor, but very good service. Food was unusual but nice. The chef is attempting to create modern vegetarian Chinese food with a 'Michelin' flair. Doesn't always pull it off, but all the food we had was tasty. Alcohol choice limited but then this is meant to be a restaurant focused on 'health'. Quite expensive
5
Located on the 5th floor of Liat Towers on Orchard Road, LingZhi vegetarian restaurant is a superb option for dim sum lunch or dinner. The dishes are freshly prepared and very tasty. My advice: skip the set menus and order a la carte. The monkey head mushroom is a must, order it with sweet and sour sauce. Delicious! I ate here three times in three days, it's a real winner
4
Went with a colleague who is vegetarian and does not like western or Indian food. Good vegetarian Chinese food is hard to find. But we were thoroughly impressed with Lingzhi. The monkey head mushroom was delicious. Also recommend the house tofu made with edamame beans. It is very pricey at $8/person but quite worth the treat. I am a meat and potatoes type gal but was happy with my meal. My colleague was delighted as he usually only has one or two options at a regular restaurant. Do give this place a try. Be prepared to pay fine dining prices.
3
The offering on the menu isn't that much and we are basically just working with the same stuff over and over again. Very restaurant setting and one look you know the prices are steep. This was my 2nd visit and the 1st one we spent 90 and this time we shot through 100. The monkey head mushrooms and the duck are recommended. It's vegetarian fine dining for sure. But the food gets starchy and fills you up easly. Still lacks taste
3
We tried the Lingzhi Vegetarian in Velocity Novena for my sister's bday. We ordered the set menu. I cant even remember the name of each dishes that came out. What I remember is all the dishes were starchy and tasteless. The only one dishes I can give credits is the stirfry long beans with shitake mushrooms and nuts. The mushrooms were fried into perfect crisps and together with the long beans, they taste great. Perhaps this is because of my omnivore tastebud, yet, my mom and brother also agree with me that the food was a bit highly priced and starchy and tasteless.. We have had so much better vegetarian cuisine in Indonesia's restaurant before with much lower prices and perhaps better quality. I give the average rating because just because of the excellent services the lady gave us. I forgot to ask for her name but she sincerity really shows during her services to us. She even gave us tips to save some cash and join the TL membership
4
I certainly agree with the last reviewer on the exotic sauteed monkey head mushrooms which for me was the stand out dish of the 6 or so courses we tried. The mushrooms were served with an excellent wasabi and sesame cream sauce which was like nothing I've tasted before. As a non-vegetarian there was certainly enough to be of interest
4
Lingzhi at Liat Towers along Orchard Road is without doubt one of the finer vegetarian dining establishments in Singapore. It serves excellent Hong Kong style dim sum at lunch time, including char siew pau (bbq pork buns), har gao (bbq pork pastry), duck gizzard in a sweet and salty molasses sauce and delicate dumplings like siew mai. Be sure to get there early, preferably before 1.30pm as the dim sum runs out early. Once you know what you'd like to have, you can call in advance and have them set it aside for you. The a la carte menu is extensive and interesting. They serve novelty items such as a 'rock and roll' salad, spinach soup served in a bamboo and exotic sauteed monkey head mushrooms, all of which are delicious.They also have a good variety of soups, mains and rice/noodles. Lingzhi is by far one of my favourite vegetarian restaurants in Singapore
4
We had a business lunch with our vegetarian customers, and this is in my impression one of the best ones i could offered to my guests.The staff are friendly and they will give their best to recommend you some dishes if you are spoilt for choice

My brother is an expat from the US living in Singapore permanently, so I knew a little about the restaurant scene in Singapore. I am a vegetarian (from the US) and was overwhelmed by the selection and quality of the food at this restaurant. My delight was pretty much unexpected as this restaurant is in a shopping mall. It is surrounded by other restaurants, most of them fast food. The waitress offered us a buffet, but we opted to order a la carte from the menu. We ordered a bunch of appetizers (including a type of breaded pumpkin roll), a couple of main dishes (roast duck and shish kebab with peanut sauce), and a few desserts (the green test tubes, "Nature's Green"). All of these items were 100% vegetarian. The food was excellent. The presentation was nice, particularly the grand finale of "test tubes": 4 test tubes filled with green fruit/vegetable juice served in a giant bowl of ice. The service was good. My stay in Singapore convinced me that many people in the service industry in Singapore have difficulty with English; this was the case also at this restaurant. However, the overall level of service was good.The price was relatively high, but still worth it considering the quality of the food

The food options and taste had pleasantly improved since our last visit 6 months ago. Absolutely worth the price.
Reservation is recommended as it can be rather full especially on weekends.

We had lunch here. Ordered 4 simple dishes and costs about S$120. We felt it was expensive. The food is quite nice, some dishes a little too salty for our liking. But it's way overpriced in our opinion.

This restaurant is quite pricy but food quality is good. If you're looking for vegetarian, this is good place to try.

There are plentiful of high tea buffets but I can’t think of any that serves vegetarian fare other than Lingzhi Vegetarian Restaurant located at Velocity @ Novena Square. This is one of my favourite vegetarian restaurants and I go to for the food and ambiance.On a Saturday afternoon, I had high tea with 2 non-vegetarian friends at Lingzhi Vegetarian Restaurant. There is an assortment of dim sum, including steamed siew mai, steamed char siew bun, steamed beancurd vegetable roll, etc.For the baked and fried dim sum, there are yam croquette, spring roll, curry puff, carrot cake, and vegetarian pork pastry. One of my favourites is the vegetarian pork pastry. The mock meat is tasty and the pastry is flaky.For side dishes, there are fried noodles, rojak and curry vegetables. The curry vegetables is a must try. It is not too spicy and the gravy is flavourful. The rojak is another of my favourite with the sweet and tangy sauce.Desserts include custard roll, red bean roll, hot and cold dessert. I loved the almond jelly with longan dessert which is sweet enough. To accompany the dim sum, we ordered jasmine tea which is not included in the buffet price. The tea is fragrant and it goes well with the food.As Lingzhi’s high tea buffet is served only on Saturday, Sunday and public holidays, do call ahead for reservations as at times the place is fully reserved

Being a vegetarian (no egg also) is very boring in places like Singapore, which has many gourmet treat for meat lovers. My guest booked this place and we were 10 in all with only me being Vegetarian, All were Singaporians and they had never been to this restaurant.I was feeling awkward and nervous as how all these meat lovers were forced to eat Vegetarian food just because of me.This restaurant serves authentic Chinese veg food and have many dishes without egg also.Obviously the discussion went on the belief on why I don't eat meat etc. etc. I said let us eat the food and we will discuss later.I think 5-6 dishes were ordered along with soup and green tea. As we started indulging in the dishes..the reaction around was amazing. Everybody started thanking me for giving them the reason of eating such great food. It was really funny..they were the host and myself their guest but they were thanking me for this opportunity.The food is really a surprise and a Must try. I don't know how many options they had but we had one brown rice dish and few green vegetable dishes, few barbecued dishes along with soup.Sorry can't remember the name but all the dishes has different taste and were just amazing.So in the end I asked, did anybody miss meat and instant reply was NO.So left them with a thought..why kill somebody for our survival when nature has abundance of options in veg to eat and enjoy. Well I can go on with my thought on it but this is not the forum..So enjoy an amazing vegetarian Chinese food in Singapore and be Surprised...

We had a little difficulty getting a recommendation from the staff for how much food to order, but two starters and two mains turned put to be just about right for three people. We actually ordered three starters, but when the third never appeared on the table or the bill, we didn't complain! The variety of dishes was impressive (many at around $15) and given more time here we'd definitely be going back

I have been to this restaurent many time. Every time there is something new to try and the sause is something magical. Different dishes come with different sauces but all of them are awe !.. Highly recommend if you are a vegetarian. Only flip side is that I have to save enough until my next visit :

We try this at Novena. 1st dish. Mushroom vegetable good from clay pot-Good. 2nd dish. Cauliflowers with mock meat. Crunchy, but i prefer it soft. Mock meat was tough to bite. The dim sum we ordered a la carte was Ordinary.Dessert was mango wrapped with glutinous skin. Tastes good. There is no oomph factor for a pricey meal of $85 for 3. Buffet is $25 Each pax. It Includes steamboat and ready cooked ( usually fried) food. Our order taker missed out some order but it was quickly rectified by colleagues

I ate here twice in my 4 days in Singapore. As a vegetarian I don't often have the chance to eat Chinese food that I can be sure is 100% vegetarian. This place does wonderful things with mushrooms and has some great fake meat dishes. I will be back

We ate here recently and loved it, it was such an interesting little place. Tough to find, as in the middle of an office block, but glad we persevered. Decor is lovely. Went with a non vegetarian who is still nattering on about how lovely the veggie duck was! Food choice good, altho a little on the expensive side. Service was interesting too! A lady was hovering nearby helping all the time, we thought she was going to start shovelling it into our mouths at one point, she was a bit over-attentive.Would highly recommend a visit

Well-prepared healthy choices of Vegetarian foods.Restaurant is tastefully decorated with efficient service. Great location at 541 Orchard Road, #05-01 Liat Towers).

Lingzhi has one of the highest quality foods in Singapore, especially for vegetarians, but is way too pricey. I could only eat here once every few months and keep my wallet intact! Great for those with money or for a one-time deal.

The restaurant is quite small and a bit old. The vegetarian dishes were very authentic and delicious. The staff was also very helpful when we were ordering. All in all, our dinner was very enjoyable. This restaurant offers good value for its delicious vegetarian cuisine.

I am not big on vegetarian food but friends took me to The LingZhi in Singapore and I was an instant convert. The beer was very cold and was a precursor to a fabulous meal. We shared many dishes that sounded like normal pork, duck and beef meals with a twist. They looked full of meaty goodness and even tasted similar but wow, they were good for me and tasted delicious. Will certainly return to this plain, hidden gem again when in Singapore to try more.Staff were attentive, service quick and a great value dinner

If you're looking for quality vegetarian food with a rather generous budget, then here's the place to go. That being said, some of the dishes can be whipped up by mothers who have years of experience in preparing vegetarian food, in their own kitchen. Be warned that they only serve in chinese style and menu isnt really extensive. Also, service and ambience are just so-so

I go through these phases. Right now i am vegetarian and greens turn me on. I had one of the best vegetarian meals of my life at a chinese restaurant called LingZhi in the Liat Towers in Singapore.The food is absolutely amazing. The strange thing is that all the dishes are simulated to look like non-vegetarian dishes.....and that too Chinese style. I had monkey brain mushroom (to die for) and Duck (tofu skin) and baby Pak choy that made me want to cry like a baby! It was so exquisitely flavored. The ambience is fine. The service is efficient and business-like (actually reminds me of Bombay's Udipi restaurants) and the cost reasonable.If you are a vegetarian and adventurous and in Singapore, go to LingZhi, you will enjoy the superb veggie fare!

Maybe i'm not the best person to review a vegetarian but after eating here 3 times (with work colleagues) I still have not found a dish here that i enjoyed. Food tends to be incredibly oily / bland and there is an over reliance on mushrooms as though its the only vegetable they have in stock.If you're after vegetarian food try Little India, much better choice and lots more taste

Have been here twice with both vegetarians and meat-eaters, Ling Zhi is widely regarded as one of the best vegetarian restaurants in Singapore, and it doesn't disappoint. Unlike many Chinese vegetarian eateries, you will not find a lot of fake 'meat' here. Rather, the menu emphasises fresh vegetables and there are a lot of mushroom dishes. The food is fresh and delicious and makes a nice change from eating meat. The claypot eggplant is delicious, as is the monkey head mushrooms (which are not commonly found). Also great are the pumpkin fritters! The food here is very accessible to all types of palates (assuming you like Chinese food) and you are definitely not sacrificing flavour to come here.The restaurant is in an office building just off Orchard Road (near Wheelock Place) called Liat Towers
