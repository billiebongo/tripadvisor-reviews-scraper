While bar hopping in clarks quay stopped here for a kebab. Service is too slow, prices were way too expensive. Could have had the same food across the road from their take away out let for 20% of the price.
5
Shiraz is superb and does a wonderful Kubideh. Tried once and keep going back ever since. The service is also pretty good, fast and always with a smile. They have a live belly dance performance also on some days. Highly recommended spot in Clarke Quay
4
As always, Shiraz Mazzeh produce the best kebabs I have ever tasted! Service with a smile too! And it doesn't break the bank!
4
We ate here after a bad dinner experience at TongKang. This food was really good and fast. We chose the outside quick service and it was worth a try. We had the chicken wrap and heated like a Panini. Very tasty and very friendly staff.
5
Whilst in Singapore we visited here twice for dessert coffee and tasty morsels while watching the chefs at work, the belly dancer and the foot traffic wandering through the busstling eateries of the quay!! We thoroughly enjoyed the hospitality and friendliness!!
5
A bit on the pricier side so it took a few days to work out way round to this place in Clarke Quay. The kebab was honestly the best I've had and I can't really say more than that. Service was prompt and friendly; the show kitchen provides some additional entertainment and conversion; but the star of the evening was the gorgeous dancer who works hard than any I've ever seen.Â Very good choice coming here

If you must come here, use EATIGO for 50% off the food. For cheaper than the price of a platter for two here, you could have the mixed grill for two at BEIRUT Grill in Arab Street which is simply amazing!The SHIRAZ platter for 2 was a mixed kebab for one in disguise. It should not be mistaken as being able to fill 2 hungry adults. (See pic attached)Of Shiraz, the location, ambience, service...all very good The food however, is average fayre per the multitude of cheaper (about 50%) cheaper! ) similar restaurants found in Arab Street. If you must come here use Eatigo. If you love this food go to Arab street, spend the 50% you save on beers in Clark Quay afterwards!.

This review is for Shiraz restaurant (authentic Persian cuisine) located opposite Shiraz Mazzeh (same management) located in Clarke Quay. I have taken many people to this restaurant and everyone has loved the delicious food served here. Right up front they serve you complimentary Persian bread with goat cheese and vegetables - yum. Their Kubideh - lamb and chicken - is superb. Perfect marination and perfectly grilled. Shandiz is another super dish - and the saffron rice that is served along with it is great.
4
During our trip in Singapur we spontanously decided to have dinner at Shiraz. The service and the food was amazing! The chicken was tender, soft and juicy as well as the kubideh. The shisha was a bit expensive but also really good. All in all we had a great time there and we totally recommend Shiraz, for persians and those who would like to taste persian cuisine
4
Haven't been to Clark Quay and even though it's quite a circus and very crowded, it's a very nice place to come on weekend because there is loads of vibe !! We chose to come to eat at Shiraz Mazzeh for Iranian food. So it will be loads of meat if one likes that sort of thing. For appetizer we had the fried eggplant which I thought was obviously fattening / rich and my friend thought was very very good. We had the meats with the rice etc - well executed, good but not exceptional. All in all, we had quite a good time.
4
The food is the same as orchard and like orchard I strongly suggest if you like falafel and swarma to try this location as well. There also friendly people there as well
3
went there or business dinner , the food was good however the palce was too noisy due to the belly dance show. friendly staff , may not be my best place to go again
4
I always cherish the veg falafel sandwich which shiraz offers..never disappoints u..so crispy juicy and quick service..choose the sauces u like..I generally prefer garlic yogurt with chilli or with hummus..very handy to eat
5
amazing sandwitch
great service
great place
delecios
fresh
checken
lamb
falafel
fries with cheese woooooooooooooow
1
The food here is below average and over priced. The service is slow and our server took a wrong order and then charged us for it.
There are many good restaurants around Clarke quay - avoid this one
4
Had a super meal... absolutely authentic Irani food!!
A little overpriced .. your looking at an average 40$ per dish... but supreme flavors
Live Belly Dancing.. Sheesha.. the works..
If your in ClakeQuay stop by.. ull be quite entertained
3
6 of us out for dinner, place looks nice from the outside and was ok inside until the music is turned up full blast and a belly dancer makes her way around the place while you are eating! Terrible really and wouldn't come here again, food was quite dry and service inattentiv
1
We choose our meals the waiter recommend I change, so I did. I took 2 mouth fulls and it was so hot my mouth was burning. The waiter did not come near our table unitl my daughter had finished. He asked how was my meal, it was still sitting there in the bowl, when I said terrible he laughed and walked off. The other waiter then came over and offered some yoghurt, I said no. The table next to us he did the same thing, changed their order and they too could not eat theirs. When the bill came I was surprised I had been charged. Plus they charged $8 per each roti - seriously a rip off. Happy hour only on top shelf beers as well
3
While we were returning from Clar quay around 2 AM, we felt little hungry. We grabbed some wraps (falafel veggie for me). They were simply amazing in taste. I had them number of times at Orchard, but this one was perfectly stuffed, grilled and well balanced.We simply loved it
3
Great place and located in the middle of all other restaurants at Clarke Quay. Shisha is extremely pricey at $50 including taxes! Shisha will be banned at the end of July 2016. Have a walk around the quay loads of restaurants and pick what you fancy really!
5
The veg Shawarna is a worth try , ice tea is amongst the best Ive ever had. This is a must try when at Clarke quay.
Lively place with good food and well priced.
4
This place is really good if you are an Asian and love Shawarma, take a break from the sea food and you can enjoy some great food with very warm & courteous service.
5
Shiraz Mazzeh is a must whilst in Clarke Quay, sensational kebab.
Went back for seconds several days later due to them being so delicious..
4
Never fail to satisfy the tummy.
I simply loved the Lamb Kebabs and the Spicy Chicken Kebabs
They can improve on the cheese fries..
5
First time tried this kebab and it was as superb, price around $10, very tasty and juicy meet, definitely worth for the price, nice happening environment at Clarke quay, both alcoholic and non alcoholic beverages available
1
The food is OK, but not worth putting up with such a bad service and incompetent management... No matter how many people we called, they just could not get an order in a timely manner...
4
Food was delicious, ordered kebabs! The ambience was nice, smell if hooks was wafting and a dancer was belly dancing! In the centre of the party district!
5
You must visit to get the authentic taste of Persian Cuisine. And that too when it is open till late night situated in Clarke Quay!!
5
Superb Persian food and a lively atmosphere makes this place a must visit if you are in Clarke Quay. The lamb kebabs were out of this world and some of the best I have ever had. Vibrant atmosphere with belly dancers to keep the crowd entertained makes for such an exciting experience
5
The food was yummy. We had to wait for an hour to get a table for 8 of us. We ordered mixed platter with lamb. The lamb was excellent. The platter with rice and complimentary nan and cheese was sufficient for 6 of us. We ordered for desserts. Some how they took very long to serve deserts and they were below average. The atmosphere was very vibrant with loud music and belly dancing on the street and later in the restaurant. We had a very good time and it is a place worth visiting
3
kebab meals were about average however quite costly compared with other restaurants. Noice from Clarke Quay bars was to hear in restaurant. Cesar salat was nothing special and cannot be recommended.
4
This review is for the kiosk opposite the main restaurant. The shawarma ordered was just yum and delicious. And more than worth the price. Suggested for a good eat on Clarke quay.
5
Tasty food along with nice music and superb belly dance is what we experienced at Shiraz!!! Recommended for the overall experience.
3
Good falafel and lamb shawarma. Quick service and well priced food. Would defn recommend for a quick bite.
5
Great food and very large portions. It was busy - popular with all cultures and the service was fast and friendly. Great drinks menu too,.
5
Great belly dance ðŸ’ƒ while dinning in the street.
Egyptian music and song.
Delicious taste.
Friendly staff.
3
Thumbs up: Quick service, veg options. Thumbs down: Average tasting food. Tip: Order the wraps or Kebabs
5
One of many things that I miss about Middle East - after work, chill and hang out with friends for Shisha and good Iranian food. Shiraz, served excellent authentic arabic food, the service was excellent, having a top notch manager, named Mr Raju...he welcome his customers with smile and open arms and as well his crew members. I speak for many, when we say Shiraz has so much to offer for that quintessential Middle Eastern experience. To all tourist. if you ever visit Singapore, one of the many places must try, Shiraz @ Clarke Quay. You don't want to miss it
5
I am reviewing the trendy kiosk of SHIRAZ MAZZEH as there is a restaurant across the road with the same name (both belong to the same owner anyway).We ordered the Falafel Kebab and the Chicken Kebab. Both were really yum and the price of roughly 8 SGD was okay. You can easily upgrade to a full menu: pay roughly 12 SGD and you will get some chips and a soft drink with it. As two of the group were vegetarians and keen on Hommus they kindly ask to get some more....and they did! Awesome!!!!The staff was really friendly.Please be aware that Falafel is available not before 7.30pm (thats what we understood....). But it was worth the wait anyway.Would we go there again? SURE!!!!
4
This is one of my favourite spots to take my friends visiting Singapore. The location is really nice, with nice ambiance and really nice food. The menu may appear a bit pricey, but on the whole, its good value for money. The serving sizes are quite filling. My favourites are their Mazzeh Platter & Kebabs. The only thing I hope they improve is that at times, their food is a bit cold by the time it is served. Tip: Do request them to serve you hot flatbreat and you will be pleased with what you get :). Do tell them not to bring the thick bread
4
if non veg is what your looking for your at the right F&B Restro , smoking hot chicken , tempting fish curry is what i found best .
4
the Iranian grills are very tasty, but the place is very crowded specially when the belly dance show starts. better to have the lunch there.
4
Well, if ever in Singapore you want grab a Kebab, go to Shiraz Mazzeh at Clarke Quay - it has got the best lamb or chicken Kebabs in town.
4
Good place for kebabs and Persian wraps.. Efficient Service and great taste . Overall value for money
3
The place is great for quick bite. The premium lamb Kebab set is value for money and also decent quality.
3
Had eaten many times in this place, somehow when I eat wraps, I just feel taste of sauce, other dishes are better than wrap
4
Only place I could find with Shisha...but the staff are great and very lively with the belly dancers.Seating is cramped but fun.
4
Undoubtedly this is the best place to eat kebabs in singapore. Great taste, great quality and value for money.
3
Clarke Quay is a very nice area, especially at night. There's a wide choice of places where you can eat but some of them are quite expensive, so I opted for Shiraz Mazzeh, which seemed a good place and not as expensive as other restaurants.The food was good and tasty and I didn't have to wait for too long to get it, also the staff was nice and friendly, and very helpful when I asked for info & details about the dishes on the menu.Good food at Shiraz Mazzeh + great vibes (Clarke Quay is full of music and lights at night) = very pleasant night
4
Staying near by we chose this restaurant wanting to try something different. That is what we got. The food came out fast and tasted great. The free flat bread kept on coming through out the meal. Being in the heart of Clarke Quay was reflected in the price, a little expensive put we enjoyed the food and service provided. The belly dancer was entertaining and seemed to love what she does. Good wine selection
4
Food was very good. Service good too, if is possible to smoke narguile there...
Good option in Clarke Quay...
4
good moption as were looking for some rolls with chicken/veg option....
but better was an Indian Restro -called RUS. very very good
4
I ordered veg kebab platter there and it was amazing. All kebabs with Persian touch with amazing music & belle dance and it didn't burnt a hole in my pocket too.
3
I got a lamb kebab with chips. It's as cheap as you will find in Clarke Quay although I wouldn't exactly call it cheap. The food was fine, nothing special but it did the job.
4
Good value for money. The service was excellent, too. I specially like the wraps, I kept coming back to order more of them during our vacation.
3
Tried a lamb one and it was very average meat had no flavour and the sauces the same. Maybe ok if your drunk or at early hours in the morning when hungry
4
My friend ordered a something which looked like steak and tasted like kabab. VERY NICELY COOKED... I could feel IRAN sitting there. Very Nice ... Will certainly visit again.
4
As a traveller I have been visiting various restaurants around the world that serve different types of cuisines.I had an opportunity to visit this place with my wife and two grown up sons for my birthday and found that this place serves a mix of both Irani and middle eastern cuisine.The service was good,the dishes were tasty and the belly dance was a surprise !!Dr.Javed Rasheed
5
We just thought a quick bite before the party begins and tried this falafel sandwich. Amazing. Mouth melting. Flavourful. Perfect as i guess it should be. Ended up having our main course here itself. location, no doubt the best you can get. Enjoy the super ambience of clarke quay, great music all around and some healthy food after an all night hard party. super.
3
I've passed this place a heap of times and always thought it was just another tourist trap but when I finally went it is found hat he food was really quite good. They had to chase up out because they had a function booked but I reckon this is worth a visit. Certainly not cheap but what do you expect for Clarke Quay.
4
Restaurant in the middle of Clarke Quay, good place to start your night adventure in Clarke Quay. The price is not expensive, good portion and many option of sauce.
5
Alright meat lovers !! You neeeeeed to go and try the spicy chicken shawarma with different sauces what Mazzeh offers...Situated right in the heart of CQ, this place has one of the best meats I have had till now...Way to go !!!
5
I have written my comments already on Shiraz Restaurant review about this place which is part of their group.
1
Poor service. No one was interested in us at all. Ignored. Dirty inside. Food was extremely overpriced $90 for a platter than wasn't enough to feed two people. Very disappointed. Will not go back here.
4
We enjoyed the mixed starter plate and also the kebab platter even though the prices were on the high side. A complimentary plate of feta cheese, olives and herbs were served after our order was taken. The naan was freshly baked and very tasty. Wine was pricy, as it often is in Singapore but I would definitely recommend the Lebanese wine. In fact that was similar in price to what we paid in London, although the kebabs were twice the price. We visited on a Thursday night and there was a very good belly dancer. People were still coming in to eat at 22.30. Persian food is not spicy, I would recommend trying it
4
Taken by friends to this charming eatery on very lively Clarke Quay. Had brilliant, tasty starter like a lamb paste with Persian bread delicious. I had the mixed Kurbideh of spiced lamb and chicken served with rice. Not too hot, the spices. Washed down with ice cold Tiger beer. This is not a cheap restaurant. Be prepared to pay Singapore $ 55 per person for two courses.
5
Its in the heart of all the action in Clarke Quay. The staff are very patient and explain everything in the menu to great detail. The food is totally awesome, the chicken, slow cooked brinjal, the fragrant rice were all a true delight. The belly dancer was keeping everyone entertained, she was ever smiling and was very talented. The music tends to be a bit loud if you are trying to have a quite dinner. If at Clarke Quay, don;t miss this place
4
We have never eaten this food before as where we live we are limited to either Chinese or Indian so for us it was an experience to try.Very glad we did as the food lived upto expectation.The belly dancer certainly helped us to choose Shiraz,staff friendly and helpful,advised us on what to try.Complimentary bread and cheese came while deciding on what dishes to try,went straight for mains,Caspian prawn fish at $39.00 and Mailasi beef/chicken at $43.00 were our choice and very nice they were,a beer and glass of wine with a pick-up kebab totally filled us up.Really great meal and entertainment thrown in would recommend this restaurant to anyone
5
I have been a regular visitor here for the past few years. I always enjoy Halim Badenjan, Kibbe with lots of pomegranate sauce, hommous, salad with feta cheese and basil, the lovely Persian freshly-baked bread and mint tea. The atmosphere is good, and we usually sit outside and enjoy the ambience of the passing crowd. Occasionally they have a belly dancer also. Definitely to be recommended
4
We stopped by the only stand selling shwarma in the Clarke Quay complex for a quick dinner. The stand is a walk up ("self-service") bar near the south entrance. The food was tasty and the fries had a delicious salty spice mix. They sell the standard grilled meats wrapped inside a pita. The pita itself was fairly thin and was more like a tortilla than pita. The price for one "pita", fries, and a coke was $17SGD
3
It was pretty much okay. There are much better options in Clarke Quay. The ambience of Clarkle Quay is just awesome,
3
If you want a quick meal whilst out at Clarke Quay these are tasty kebabs. Around $10 Each chicken/lamb. Eating at other restaurants at Clarke Quay will be around $18 a dish upwards.
5
Best shawarma ever had I loved to go again and have a lamb shawarma and my wife loved the spicy chicken shawarma . The spicy shawarma is only on clarky location they don't offer on orchid road branch
3
For the price, it's quite reasonable... Serving was huge enough for me and it's tasty enough for my satisfaction. I enjoyed the french fries much more than the Shawarma. Good food.
4
shiraz serves one of the best kubideh . It's got the perfect setting . Prompt service . And the dash of belly dancing is a bonus Love there quail as well .The nan bread with feta cheese and rocket leaves are as fresh as one can get Highly recommende
4
Great place for a late night snack especially after some heavy drinking. Nothing like greasy food. They generally only sell kebabs, sausages & fries. We had the premium lamb kebab with extra meat. Once you make the order & pay you follow the line down as they make your kebab. A bit like Subway where you choose your veggies & sauces.Only downside is they are rather slow. Friendly but the line could move faster. Other than that would still recommend after a good night out
4
Not sure what's up with the other reviewers on here having bad experiences. This is the kebab stand across from the actual sit down restaurant. They usually have a few different meats and falafel to go inside the shawarma. Pick your toppings and sauces, then wait a few minutes for it to be grilled. I enjoy the garlic yoghurt and hummus sauces with spicy chicken and veggies. Fries are always fresh. Music is loud, so you may not want to hang out for too long, but it's a great place to grab a quick bite to eat. You can get a good sized shawarma, fries and a drink for about $15. Very reasonable in my opinion. I think the location of Orchard Road is better (food quality and service wise), but this one is still good. I enjoy coming to Shiraz every time I'm in Singapore
4
First dinner in Singapore for my wife and me. Kind and efficient staff rapidly welcomed us and took our orders. Food was delicious: first of all, they offered complimentary pita bread with a bit of savoury cheese, fresh tomato and herbs. Then "Chef's Signature Platter" followed, namely a sampling of four appetizers:Kufteh-Ye Anar-O Pesteh (lamb meatballs with pomegranate sauce and pistachio)Kashk-E-Bademjan (roast sliced eggplant with a topping of sun dried yogurt, mint and fried onion)Borani Esfanaj (sautÃƒÂ©ed spinach with yogurt, fried onion and garlic)Dolemh (vine leaf stuffed with steamed rice mixed with herbs);and then a persian rice dish called "Morasah polo with chicken": juicy chicken with saffron-flavored basmati rice mixed with cashew, orange peel, berries and pistachio. A wonderful kaleidoscope of flavors!Servings were generous. Service very good. Bellydance show was enjoyable. We regret we did not taste desserts.83 singapore dollars: value for money. If we could, we'd surely come back again
4
their falafel wrap was our favorite dish during our stay in singapore ; they have an outlet on orchard road which we frequented too. you would not think that a place like this would have good vegetarian food, but it was just delicious. their service is very good too, and they are pretty quick in making their stuff to
4
We have visited this branch lately. The lamb kebab with the veg and garlic sauce was perfectly done. It was great with the fries and the beer. the chicken and beef hot dog was ok not as good as other hotdogs we gave tried especially in anerican restaurants , but was satisfactory.the price wise it looks alright gicen the lication and crowd so it wasnt expensive at all. They gave happy hour but u need to be there i guess before 7 pm
4
Clarke Quay is a Night spot with lots of bars and eating out places.
Shiraz is a good one in ME/Asian category.
Halal Food.
Seating outside is much more fun with people passing through and some Belly dancing happening. :)
4
Nice food and dining experience, something a little bit different from bar food in Singapore.
We sat outside so we could people watch, but be aware that they have belly dancers at times over the evening, which may influence where you want to sit.
2
We opted for the 2 person taster platter. The only tasty part of the meal was the complimentary salad at the start - the cheese was yummy! The rest, well we ate it but very unsatisfying. Boat Quay may have been a better option.
5
Love the chicken shawarma :) and falafel kebab.
They say that it is best Halal food in Singapore However it serves Beer Too
1
We went to this restaurant to sample Persian food as one of our extended family is originally from Persia (Iran). The food was very average and very expensive - portions were tiny, there was no real atmosphere in the place and all of the plates we were given had chips in them. This is a tourist trap - there are hundreds of better places to eat in Singapore - waste of a good night out. Staff were helpful but owners have no idea
2
Today afternoon we had lunch at shiraz forum , my self ordered chicken kebab , the taste was not was not good as before , as I opened the packet of kebab to eat fillings all dropped from below and I saw burned meats inside , Staff was not friendly as well and more important I think the staff was not well trained , regret to eat next tim
4
This place had great atmosphere and great food. The kebabs tasted extra extra good. The kind of extra good that MSG makes. I strongly suspect their food is chock loaded with MSG as I got my standard MSG reaction after eating here. For those who aren't so sensitive as me I would highly recommend
5
I had been trying to find some good kebabs from quiet sometime and Shiraz was the place which had put an end to my search. During my 3 days visit to Singapore, one of my meal was everyday at Shiraz. Irrespective of where you have it (On orchard road near Hilton or outside Takashimaya or at Clarke Quay) they make no compromise on the taste and you relish every bite of it
4
These are more comments about the Shiraz Mazzeh kiosks in various parts of Singapore, than the restaurant in Clarke Quay. The shawarma's are yummy - no risk of a scandal here (spoiled meat, or traces of pork or rats as in Europe). Falafel's are also very good. Don't know if it's halal because they also sell beer. Only problem is seatings are limited. Anyway, it's not in the local culture to eat on the pavement or while walking under the sun
4
A friend's recommendation brought all of us here. The pita bread served as entree was free. The dip includes feta cheese. We straight away ordered the Shiraz Special Platter Combo which consisted of lamb and beef as it is already quite a big portion. I'm never a fan of lamb, but this time I must admit that the lamb was tender. There was no usual meaty smell of the lamb. The beef was good as well, but I was really impressed with the lamb. Unexpectedly, the kebab went well with the yoghurt dip. The Basmati Rice was pleasantly fragrant and it was topped with shredded butter. There was a sweet cake that came with it. The baklava for dessert was not as what I expected, as it was too gooey and sweet. But the Persian ice cream was not disappointing at all.There was a belly dancing show starting at 8.45 pm at the entrance of the restaurant. The dance lasted for two songs
4
Delicious Iranian food, nice atmosphere, great service but very pricey, however, if you happened to be in Clarke area you should try eating there.
4
as i said i only tried the sandwiches and they were exquisite
yummy
outside seating on small risen tables only ( you know like the tables used in hotels while a buffet )
5
Shiraz has both a restaurant and a fastfood takeout. We tried the takeout and were very happy with the food. Tasted fresh and portion sizes were very good. Definitely add fries and a drink for a more complete meal. Prices were reasonable as well.
4
The quaint restarunt initially seesm mispaced in teh very Chinese ambience of Singapore but then you realise its part of Singapores international allure. Good Lebanese and Mid Eastern foodGood choices for all tastes including vegans.Prices are not too high and the Chinese belly dancer is enthusiasitic and well moved.The service is prompt and provides good explanations and advice
3
We had their shwarmas and they were pretty good. Didn't try the main restaurant though. The falafel shwarma with hummus/garlic yoghurt sauce would be a good choice for vegetarians. Their falafel side is also good, with two falafels tossed into a salad with lettuce, cucumber and tomato in a dressing of your choice for just $2
4
It was my very first time dining at Shiraz. It was a long due delay since 2012, and finally.... I was overalled very satisfied with the service, the quality of food served. I was caught by surprise upon seeing the ordered food... whatever that was written in the menu and whatever that was served, was beyond imagination
5
Friendly staff, food that makes you say,"mmmmm", and shisha to smoke after dinner. The restaurant is clean and had a good ambiance, decor is not overly done and gives character to the place. The food was great specially the grilled minced lamb which was very flavorful
4
I saw this place and went here. I ordered chicken kebab with french fries and beef special sausage with french fries also. The chicken kebab is yummy and tasty! And the french fries is also awesome. However, when i ordered the beef special sausage later, it was cold and the french fries is also not hot. Overall, the kebab is delicious
3
I really enjoyed the food. Lamb chops was very good. Comes with lots of other large portion items on the plate which is not useful. Reduce the sides on the plate. Reduce the prices. Yup. Just too expensive. Mains averaged S$45 sadly. The price was not worth it. Service was nothing worth mentioning. Average. Interior was nice and classy. You get a free bread starter. Nice but does not warrant the prices. Some belt dancing outside with lots of hooka smokers. I would really want to come back again. But more S$135 for two lamb mains and two cocktails (one virgin). Nothing else. So. What else. Well. Lots of other places to eat at Clark quay :-) so my next visit will have some options. Last point. At Shiraz resturant the starters and desserts were well priced for the location
4
The food is amazing, the ambiance is perfect and the price is reasonable! Try their grilled Kebabs, perhaps the best you'll find in the area. Went there with the vegetarian friend, they don't have many veg options but still one of the best restaurants in Clarke Quay
