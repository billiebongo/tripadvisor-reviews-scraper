One of my 2 porridge stalls I frequent after night jogs; I can say I do visit this place at least average once per month. Parking is slightly "difficult" as it is outside all the private houses nearby; think it is illegal, thus must watch for the parking aunties!!!Always with many customers even at 9-10pm; one good thing about this stall is the choice of dishes are plentiful and price reasonable??? The servers are generally polite and friendly at least to me...and the drinks stall is from the coffee shop opposite!!Nice place for a porridge treat..

This shop is quite famous in the Kovan area and we would visit frequently for its porridge. There would be a need to queue and choose the food, ordering of either rice or porridge and they would send the food to your table. It is slightly more humid sitting inside and advisable to sit outside instead. Food selection is wide and choices are plenty, dishes are not expensive and can shared among all the family member. Highly recommended

Was at this restaurant and tried the Teochew porridge. Reasonable priced and the bean curd and saulty veg was good. The meat was tender and it's quite okay. Not many customers though. And the service was okay . Can visit if u want a simple Teochew porridg

I'm frequent here during Sunday evening for teochew porridge. They serve authentic porridge. Non-aircon area. I like the duck meat as they give generous portion of duck. I like cabbage and the salt egg and egg with meat. For such quality food, I feel it is worth the price. Definitely expensive than hawker cente but cheaper than most restaurant.Surprise it is not listed as this is one of the top porridge recommended by online forum. I always come on evening therefore not sure if it is open in the morning as the stretch of famous eateries target evening to midnight crowd
