The service was quite fast, the shrimp appetizers were delicious, the crab cakes as well, but we found the chicken roti too spicy. The rainbow cake convinced us of course with its colours but disappointed with the flavour.
The prices are not the cheapest.
4
On a hot and humid day you need to take a break, as the Gardens are extensive and this is as good a place as any. Service was quick and the food and drink decent and reasonably priced, (for this location).
4
A very good pit stop for a mid-morning cake. The display of cakes was very tempting and proved to be equally enjoyable.On the advice of another customer we tried the Iced Lychee Tea. Very thirst quenching and a good choice. So much better than normal iced tea.Depending on the temperature, you can sit under cover, outside, or inside, with air conditioning. The service was good, if not outstanding

Strolling through Gardens by the Bay we thought it time for an early lunch. We ordered drinks and as I was hungry ordered four deep fried dishes, Calamari, Mushrooms, Onion Rings and Truffle Chips.Food arrived one dish at a time, freshly cooked and tasty, but the portions were huge by UK standards so there was more food than the two of us could comfortably eat. At the end of our meal we were offered a doggy bag.The food was fine, but not special. The service was OK. Location was convenient
4
This cafe appears to be part of a local chain and the menu is varied in that it equally caters for both casual snacks but also full lunches (and possibly dinners) with full bar license so beers and wines available although the selection is rather limited. Food is not bad, service is excellent and not overly pricey, given its location.
1
Rude service. Over priced. Waited 20 minutes to get seated. Were told burger wasn't available. Ordered wedges and onion rings and a cake. 2 people who ordered after us got served 15 minutes before us and were allowed to order the burger? Cake never came. Wedges worked out to be about $1 per wedge. It's only still in business because they have a monopoly. Really don't bother.
4
You won't have a fine dining experience at Bakerzin as its not that sort of place but what you will get is friendly quick service with, considering the location,reasonable prices.If you are between the zones and want to rest weary feet, this is as good a place as any. The coffee is first class and although on this occasion we didn't order cooked food, there is a selection of mouth watering cakes of the " Must eat " variety!It not overly large but we only had to wait a few minutes for a table although some other customers weren't happy at having to wait at all and made quite a scene which was all a bit silly really! Well worth a visit

Stopped in while down at the gardens. Other reviews are right the customer service is next to none. The seafood pasta was fine, neither great nor bad but have to say the bruschetta was the worst I’ve had in my life, the bread was soggy, flavourless tomatoes and about half a basil leaf for the whole thing. Definitely wouldn’t come back
1
My friend and I wanted to have the hi-tea set, and the waitress told us they do not have this and that, and would be replaced by other items. We agreed to have the set, together with 2 cups of black coffee that come with the hi-tea set. The waitress repeated the order (and other drinks); the ordered time was 5.07pm.My other 3rd friend ordered his peri peri chicken. Our black coffee and other drinks came in less than 5 mins.However, we waited 20 mins (5.27pm) and our hi-tea set and chicken were not served yet. My friend reminded them, and the chicken only came 10 mins later (5.37pm). Our hi-tea set couldn’t have taken half hour to prepare, as the cafe was not really extremely crowded.We decided to cancel the order at 5.45pm. The waitress checked and told us that we did not order the hi-tea at all!From the time we were told we did not order the hi-tea to paying at the cashier, their explanation was very defensive. Even when my friend explained to the cashier that the black coffee actually came with the hi-tea set, they still slapped us with the individual coffee cost.Despite the poor service and dining experience, we still had to pay 10% service charge.The receipt is a concrete evidence that sends a message to us customers that their staff is absolutely right in any way, plainly transactional, and void of customer centric attitude! I cannot believe this especially happened in a tourist attraction location! The worst non customer-centric experience I’ve ever encountered

Ordered x1 main, x2 alacarte drinks and x1 high tea set for two (the high tea set came with x2 drinks and x1 fancy tier of food)x4 Drinks arrived promptly.Around half an hour later we enquired about the whereabouts of our food.The x1 main course came about 5 minutes later.Went to the bathroom and came back and the x1 fancy tier was nowhere to be seen. Told the staff we would like to cancel the x1 hi tea set and was told we did not order it.Waitress with glasses was defensive and insisted that we said that we did not want the x1 fancy tier and even mentioned that she found it strange that three of us ordered x4 drinks, and had actually checked with us throughly.If she had found the order of x4 drinks strange, what about the three grown men ordering x1 main course? Anything peculiar about that?The cashier did not hold much water either as she told us the hi tea set was till 5.30pm but we ordered at 5pm, which had nothing to do with the Miscomm. Credibility questionable here.The coffee they serve taste really bitter and has a horrid after taste, as though it had been over extracted. Even the latte has the same unpleasant flavors in it that even the milk was unable to mask.Our first visit in 2015 was flawless though
4
Stopped for light lunch after spending the morning in Gardens by the Bay.
Small restaurant, but very busy at that time of day.
Staff were busy but efficient.
Food tasty and reasonably priced.
4
This small but excellent restaurant in the Bay Gardens itself, is an excellent but small haven, offering good food and excellent service, close to the entrance to the Domes.
5
My husband had a medical emergency while dining in the restaurant (17th dec) and I cannot fault the treatment we were given by both staff & customers.
3
We stopped here for coffee on arrival mid-morning at Gardens by the Bay and then mid-afternoon when we were leaving. Good coffee - but S$30 for four cups of coffee? Seems a bit extreme even for this premium location.
5
My daughter and I visited for dinner before viewing the sound and light show at the Super Tree Grove.They were very busy, but our orders were taken quickly and our meals arrived in a timely manner.My daughter had the butter chicken with naan bread which she reported as being fairly spicy, but good, and I had the fish and chips which were excellent. The batter on the fish was light, and the fish succulent, and the chips were crisp. It came with a small, tasty, salad. We both had a Coke Zero to drink. Our total bill was S$50.40 which I think was reasonable for such good food and large portions.The service was excellent. Although the staff was run off their feet, they remained very friendly and extremely efficient. Well done
2
I continued my world-wide campaign to find the best BLT IN THE WORLD here. Sadly BakerZ doesn’t even make it past the first round. I give it a 3 - 4 out of 10. Overcooked bacon and tasteless tomato. A bonus point for the nice chips. My wife’s bruschetta was mostly cold (tasteless) tomato and probably wouldn’t even trouble the scorer in Italy
2
After walking around the magnificent Gardens by the Bay we needed a snack and a sit down, so we found Bakerzin.It took a while to be served as the process involved trying to catch the eye of a server who was leaning over the food service counter and tucking into a cake on the counter behind. It seemed strange that a server would be allowed to eat from a food preparation/service counter.There was a two-for-one offer on some cakes, which helped bring the cost down, but it was still expensive to have a piece of cake and a coffee there. That said, the coffee was really good and the cakes were delicious and beautifully presented.I asked for the bill when we were ready to leave and although the waitress acknowledged and there was nobody else to serve, she seemed to forghet in an instant and so we needed to remind her. Paying was slow due to the lack of interest by the waitress
4
This is in a great spot near the garden domes. There is a smallish menu but what it does, it does well. We both had some thing from their sandwich range, and went back later for cake and coffee. The cakes are also good, and if you engage brain you can avoid the more synthetic tasting ones. Service was great
4
It was late morning and we needed a coffee after walking in the Gardens by the Bay and before we visited the domes. This was an ideal place. There's inside and outside seating and friendly staff. We had excellent coffee. The menu looked good but we weren't ready for food
4
It's less fuss and fancy than the other eateries around the Bay Gardens, but serves up quite a pleasant selection of meals and snacks. Just out of the crowds area, so more peaceful, still with a view out. We stopped after the exhausting tourist agenda on marina bay that Singapore now demands of visitors by sheer dint of extravagant displays. Was a comfortable respite - can recommend it
4
Came to see the light show at 7.45pm & was there at 6pm so just wanted to have a light dinner, calamari was delight & wedges but not the cheapest in town.
3
We were at Gardens by the Bay and popped in for a snack and a coffee. I can say good coffee done well. We were served promptly and everything was clean.
This was nothing special but ideally situated and convenient.
4
Good casual dining, nothing unique but it's decent if you need something to eat. Pretty decent selection for an attraction restaurant. Try to sit inside if you can. Go for the burger if you can. Thai curry is ok too.
3
Very basic pub style food. Watery pasta and no salad with the burger. Staff were efficient, but certainly not friendly.
5
Small cosy place, you can either sit outside or in the air con inside. Comfortable, excellent coffee and surprising cakes, such as the melon cheese cake.
5
Very nice indoor/outdoor restaurant that specializes in desserts, including cakes and ice cream. Great place to stop during Gardens by the Bay touring to cool off and take a break.
3
Okay for a stop, but not that special.
Prices quite high, but that is due to the location and Singapore is not cheap at all.
Food is okay and enjoyable, but the stop should expect high class
5
Just stopped by for coffee, well located, air conditioned. Very nice ice latte, friendly service and the macaroons are amazing.
4
We loved this little cafe, the weather was steamy and we had done a fair bit of walking, as next we were going to see the Flower Dome and Bakerzin was just near where we were going to buy the tickets.We both had an iced coffee and ordered something small to eat, all was very nice, there were delicious cakes on display and the menu was quite good but we only needed a snack. It is in a great location, as you walk up to the main area for tickets
5
I am not a burger person unlike my wife who loves them, however I decided to try one at this restaurant and although as I already mentioned I don't eat burgers very often this one was the best that I have ever had. Service was very good and the place was spotlessly clean
3
Burgers...inedible chicken burger and hurried us as they shut at 9...without telling is that when we sat down at 8:40!
3
We ordered the steak, and their seafood pasta. Both were very delicious, but at the time were were there, there were only 2 visible waitstaff, which is probably why they were too curt and not very attentive.
3
Cakes here are average. Service is average. Prices are average. Ambience is also average. Just an average place for coffee.
1
Went here as it is conveniently located between between Cloud forest & flower dome.When you buy your admission tickets to the two conservatories you are also given a $5 voucher for each ticket you buy to use at Bakerzin.The food was terrible I had the miso eggplant salad - which I left after one bite- it was awful eggplant not cooked though & the miso paste was thick & overpoweringly salty. I did give the waitress feedback & nothing was done about it.The truffle fries were okay - 3 out of 10.The coffee was okay.When we went to pay we were charged for everything including the salad that was not consumed. The bill came to $50 & we were told that you can only use one $5 voucher per bill- even though the back of the voucher states that you can use the $5voucher as long as you spend more that $20.We asked for a split bill - so we could use both vouchers - which was reluctantly accepted.Overall bad food - overpriced for quality & poor service.
4
Had a quick lunch here when visiting the Gardens at the Bay as you get a discount voucher with your Dome tickets. We found it fine although there are clearly mixed opinions. This is basically a Cafe not a restaurant. Clearly gets busy at times as not a huge number of tables. Very good value for Singapore as UK visitors will soon appreciate
5
We stumbled upon this place after visiting the Gardens by the Bay. What a pleasant surprise. It was clean, nice atmosphere and friendly staff the dÃ©cor and crockery etc were all very nice and tasteful. The food was really tasty and well presented. A fabulous lunch
4
Came across Bakerzin while walking around Gardens By The Bay during valentines day. Ordered Carbonara, Beer Battered Fish n Chips and Chocolate Souffle. We were seated inside which had about 8 seating tables, it can be quite packed inside the cafe/bistro if its fully occupied. Carbonara - Was rather blend and very dry. Beer battered fish and chips - Had a crunchy batter and was moist on the inside, served with fries and salad. Chocolate Souffle - Tasted more of fluffy egg whites rather than its chocolate flavour. However, if you're looking to chill somewhere in Gardens by the bay I would recommend Bakerzin as you could just simply order drinks along with fries and have a rest before continuing to explore the rest of the area :) . Service overall was quick & efficient as well
4
Whilst visiting the Gardens By The Bay, we stopped by here for a quick lunch (somewhat helped by the S$5 voucher which you receive when you book to go into the "Domes"). Nevertheless, we were seated fairly promptly, and we opted to share their Signature Burger (which they immediately offered to cut in half for us). One of the tastiest and juiciest burgers we have had in a long time - served with spicy potato wedges - excellent. The total bill, including 2 x Latte's, came to S$35.50 before the S$5.00 voucher was taken off, making for a nice cheap lunch. Recommende
5
We had lunch at this coffee shop and it was delicious. I had the calamari and it was tender and enjoyable. The service was quick and the waitress was pleasant. We would not hesitate to recommend this coffee shop to anyone visiting the "Gardens by the Sea".John & Gail Lane
3
It's hot and humid. We are hungry, hot and thirsty. We were given a $5 discount voucher when we bought tickets to the domes. We went to this place and did as the sign said and waited to be seated. Eye contact with wait staff was made on several occasions and no one came to seat us (lots of empty tables). In the end after a few minutes we collected our own menus and went and sat down. Oddly, we were served promptly and the food was nice. The bruscetta was enormous for one so excellent value for money. Just work on the service and it would get a higher rating.
5
Just stopped by for a cold drink and piece of their very yummy Black Forest cake - highly recommended!
Service was efficient, prices reasonable and the chance to cool off priceless...
5
Signature burger was the BEST! This place is moderately priced and has an excellent menu. Service is a bit slow; but they are friendly. I would eat here again.
2
The food is overpriced and not that great. The staff seemed to find it hard to stay on top of service. They had run out of ingredients for the chicken sandwich during lunchtime on a weekday. Go somewhere else!
4
We had eaten here before and, based on our previous experience, we had no hesitation in eating here again. It was fairly quiet when we arrived so we didn't have to wait or a table. Service was prompt and our order was taken quickly. We didn't have to wait too long for our food which proved to be tasty and well presented. It's a good place for a snack and drink and is conveniently situated near the domes. Prices are a little above average but this probably due to its location. Would we eat here again.....yes
3
I had big expectations from this place before visiting this place. It was ok. Service is poor. They billed us wrong twice. one for extra water and once for wrong ice cream. The amer pastry was nice but the popcorn ice cream was awful!there was a waiting time of at least 30 minutes
1
We went for dinner after spending afternoon at Gardens. A sign said " wait to be seated". There were empty tables, none had been cleared, no one was offering us seating so we went in or would still be waiting. Eventually got someone to clear the table and get us a menu then 15-20 minutes later had to grab a staff member passing to take our order. When food was served we had to ask for cutlery. Food was good. Sure we could have walked out without paying as still no service and again grabbed someone and demanded bill... everyone in the place had same problems.
3
Stopped by for lunch today. Service was prompt and courteous.Sat inside as it was a bit hot and humid outside (always so in Singapore).Ordered iced lemon tea - came unsweetened but with a separate serving of syrup if you like it sweet; tasted fine but needed more ice in the glass to make it cold. The other drink ordered was cold lychee tea - this is perfect.Food-wise 3 dishes were ordered. One - Chicken mayo sandwich (partially toasted) which was nice, came with regular fries/chips and a good asian mayo dipping sauce for the fries. Two - oriental chicken wings - 8 pieces deep fried but lacked any real taste, even the chilli sauce was just hot only (no other taste). This dish has potential but can definitely be improved. Three - truffle fries. This was a WINNER. Awesome taste with the truffle scent coming through nicely. Had to ask for the asian mayo dipping sauce which it was supposed to be served with.The truffle fries plus chicken mayo sandwich allowed for 3 star rating. The lack lustre chicken wings let down what would have been a great experience.Price-wise less the SD$50 which was ok. Happy to come back but will chose something other than the wings
2
Further to previous review, my friends and I also at the beef burger however we did not send ours back. We noticed that our burgers were also pink in the middle but thought nothing of it given it was beef (as opposed to something like chicken). Suffice to say my fellow travelling companion had a violent reaction to this meal almost immediately after (gastric upset). Myself I spent the entire night with a lovely dose of food poisoning.Western travellers - find somewhere else to eat
1
We ordered drinks and New Zealand beef burgers and waited a considerable amount of time for the burgers to arrive. It's quite dingy in the cafe so I didn't realise until half way through my burger that the meat was almost raw inside. I must point out that eating under done burgers is at your own risk as the nature of ground beef is that bacteria on the outside of the meat is transferred inside and if the inside of the meat isn't cooked through then any bacteria present is not killed off. Under cooked beef burgers are banned in some countries for this reason. When I complained about my burger the waiter really didn't care and told me it was medium rare, I did not order medium rare and was not advised of a choice when I ordered my meal. He then advised that it would take 35 minutes to be re done, I told him not to bother and we finished our drinks and went to the counter to pay the bill. No apologies, no offer to refund the price of my meal (I also lost the mediocre fries that were on the plate), no service at all. As we were walking away the waiter brings out my plate and said the burger had been cooked now and did I still want it. Same plate, same half eaten burger. If I could rate this place no stars I would

Visiting Gardens by the Bay on a warm afternoon, as a good Aussie, it was time for a cold beer and something to eat. While our visits to the Gardens website prior to the visit suggested a good range of places to eat and drink, we actually found it a little tricky to find the cafes. This was the first we found, so parched, in we went. While its specialty seems to be cakes and afternoon tea, the beer was cold and the hot wedges were ... interesting. There were some beer specials so we went with one of the locals and it fixed the thirst. While nothing in Singapore of this style is cheap, it certainly proved a good spot to rest the feet, chat and enjoy a cold one! Service was fine but given there were only about 10 there at the time, hard to make a good judgement
4
Located inside Gardens by the bay, we stopped here by because of its well known name in my origin country. We ordered beef marsala and bakerzin signature budget. They were not disappointing and we're quite satisfied. Relatively good price for a restaurant in singapore
4
Good and fresh food - great location close to the garden bay - highly reccomended - fast service and nice employee
5
While at the Gardens by the Bay, I saw this little eatery and at first IU just wanted some tea but after looking at the menu, I decided to try some food - I had baked sausage and Iced tea - both were delicious, the sausage was very fresh and nicely presented with some nice side dishes and dips.If you want to go here simply look for the main shops and ticket booth for the Gardens domes and look backwards, it will be behind you :)Well worth a visit if you are in the are
4
Location- Right smack at gardens by the bayFood - Ordered 1 salmon penne - good amount of salmon. 1 beef marsala - I will order this again. Downright tasty, the beef was nicely marinated and tender One ice chocolate and one cappuccino.Service- Average service. Seated us quickly even though it was three quarters packed. I didn't see that manager who was in one of the earlier reviews months ago.Value- around $60 which includes 10% service charge and7% gst. slightly on the high side of prices
4
Located behind the gift shop at Gardens by the Bay, it was the perfect lunch stop for a western style meal. At $47.80 for two mains and two drinks it wasn't the cheapest meal, but it was full of flavour, served within a reasonable time and located in a beautiful location. There are a couple of other main restaurants near by as well as some fast food options
5
The food and drinks were all delicious. We ordered the chicken mayo sandwich and the beef hamburger with wedges. Neither disappointed and were just what we needed for lunch. Our Italian sodas were refreshing and ice cold, as was the iced lychee tea. Our wait staff were efficient and courteous, and the whole experience was very pleasant. As we were leaving we noticed the cake display. If only we had left room!
5
Right next to the greenhouses this place serves an afternoon set of cake and a beverage of choice for just under 10$, which is a really good deal if you choose something like an ice cream float or milkshake for drink. We also had some lunch there. I'd suggest them to add some warning on the menu because the "Mothers Trad Curry" or something that I chose from the menu was seriously scorching. This mother must hate her kids to make this kind of curry for them. Once I got used to the heat, I ate something that I thought was carrot, but in fact was a whole chilli. Outch! To cool my mouth I had some rainbow cake that really was delicious. Other cakes looked yummy too
3
After our bad experience at Pollen, my friend and I sat down for lunch at Bakerzin, as we were too hungry to try and find another place for lunch. I ordered a Chicken Mayo sandwich and my friend ordered a Pearl Barley Salad and Potato Wedges. Unlike its neighbour, we received our food in about 15 minutes. The Sandch and salad were good and so were the wedges. It wasn't the best and freshest food but it served the purpose
3
We stopped here while visiting the Garden by the bay as we wanted to get some snaks for the kid. We noticed they had a Kids menu after placing the order. The person who took our order never bothered to tell us. However the food was lovely but expensive
5
We are pleased to find this cafÃ© with its great array of delicious cakes, friendly staff, and selection of teas and coffee. This is a very enjoyable stop for us, but a comment on prices. The listed prices are expensive but just acceptable, considering the situation. However, I was surprised by the added service charge and GST which brought our charge for two drinks and two cakes to $27
4
Enjoyed our meal here. Service was quick and friendly. The pulled pork burger was a bit spicy but very enjoyable.
4
Very nice lunch meal. We had the signature burgers and they were so delicious my partner wanted 2! Perfect size with succulent beef patty.
Highly recommend
Please consider offering wifi. Slow ordering of meal
2
We stopped in this restaurant for something to eat and a drink. We asked for croissant and smoked salmon, sorry we only serve this up to 11A.M ,ok we just have 2 Mango teas, when they arrived they were totally tasteless pity . I wouldn't recommend this place the attitude of some of the staff makes you feel like they are doing you a favour
4
We stayed in Singapore (Marina Bay Sands) for just two nights on a stop over on our way back home to the UK from the Philippines... after 3 weeks of eating lots of rice and chicken we were craving something nice and satisfying! The burgers are so good! So good that even though we were only in Singapore for 2 days we actually ate at Bakerzin 3 times! They're in a great location at the Gardens By The Bay and considering this the prices are still affordable!
1
Possible the worse service ever. The manager took 10 minutes to seat us even though the place was empty. He then proceeded to act very rudely while taking the order and serving us. I have attached a photo of the guy (wearing grey shirt taking order). Don't waste your time here unless you want to feel used and abused... And the food you may ask? Not good at all..
3
Went during Xmas eve and the promotion available is slightly confusing. We ordered the tea set which comes with a slice of cake and a drink. When we were settling the bill, we had wanted to pay using OCBC 365 credit card but was told that it's public holiday thus no credit card promotion. We immediately clarified on the tea set which should not be available on public holiday but was told that it's available cause it's a Thursday. Eventually we were charged tea set price cause it's Thursday but we're unable to use credit card promotion cause it's public holiday??!
3
Food is a step up from fast food, but nothing special otherwise. We had Thai pork rice and the Biz Burger. Liked the Mango Float though. It is expensive ie the two meals and drink came to S$52.50. Guess the location means it will be expensive
2
Let me tell you a little about the history of Singapore.A few years after Napoleon's defeat at Waterloo in 1815 and the subsequent decline in threats to the Home Islands, Britain looked to gain an advantage in trading posts in the East. Sir Stamford Raffles was appointed Lieutenant Governor at Bencoolen. Shortly after that, looking to consolidate Britain's reach into the areas controlled by the Dutch and the Portuguese, Raffles arrived in Singapore in 1819.Construction work began almost immediately, with the British laying down foundations for the port, the city and the tin mines which were a hallmark of Singapore's early trade. Immigrants and traders came from India, China and further afield, and very soon after the early settlement was established, the gardens and a small cafe were established.Raffles returned to Singapore in 1822 and reorganised the fledgeling colony. After a particularly tiring day of dealing with trade delegations, Raffles stopped by this cafe and ordered a coffee and some cake. Frustrated by his inability to attract the attention of the wait staff, he returned to his own residents house by the river and took tea there with his family.I was in the Bakerzin cafe last weekend when a member of the staff finally emerged from the kitchen with Sir Stamford's order for coffee and cake. Goodness knows when mine will be ready
3
We got our lunch here after enjoying the flower dome.. Ordered burger and sandwich.. It was so so, the price is understandably expensive since it is located right in between the dome itself.. We had to walk few minutes to the public toilet to wash our hands since they didn't provide one..
4
For a park restaurant it was very good and the pricing was fair for its closeness to a main attraction. A very good range of desserts and they do an afternoon tea package for $15 pp. Their signature burger was a bit wet, they need to rest the burgers after cooking so all the juices dont flow into the bun , plus as we have found in other burgers the mushrooms are soggy again leading to a soggy bun. The wedges were really nice and you should order more with your meal, they disappear so quick
3
I'll keep this short & simple. Expensive. Food substandard. Never try tarts in Singapore. The Base is brick biscuits! Staff 5 stars. Mango souffle saviour
5
Very good food, a nice wide menu and high standards in Quality, a little expensive but still within budget.
4
The location of this outlet is perfect for visitors to the Gardens by the Bay.The pasta was good. One of our favourite was the aglio olio, simple but done perfectly. The seafood pasta was very appetising. We like both the foret noir and the strawberry shortcake. Perfect to have it with a cup of coffee
4
We just needed a little refuelling on a very hot day so stopped off here before we went to visit the Flower Dome.The menu was quite extensive, from breakfasts, snacks and light bites like sandwiches to main meals, like pasta and salads, lovely puddings, alcohol or lovely, refreshing soft drinks. You could sit inside or out and we chose out as it was still shaded and cooler.My husband opted for a Caesar salad but I settled on a concoction called mango-colada (it looked gorgeous in the picture on the menu) - mango, coconut ice-cream, a mint-infused coconut mousse and rum sauce. While my husband had an iced latte, I had a mouth-watering iced lime sorbet - delicious! We were very happy with our choices and portion sizes were good. We saw other plates of food passing- some of the pasta dishes and burgers - and they looked good too.We thought prices were reasonable with the whole bill totalling approx $S35 (Â£17/18), service was fine and everyone was very pleasant.
3
Visited Bakerzin between visits to the domes in Gardens by the Bay.Reasonable menu at reasonable prices plus quick service. What more can you ask for when light on for time.My burger was exactly what was advertised and the pasta was acceptable.Would I go back there? Yes
4
This place gets 5stars for desserts. Mango mousse and pubs colada tart were out of the world. Other tarts were very good too.Food though good, didn't meet the standards of desserts. Hence overall 4*. Anyhow, this place is definitely worth a visit (or more) to satisfy sweet cravings
5
Visited this restaurant whilst visiting the domes and gardens of the Marina Bay area in Singapore.Whilst this is not the best restaurant I have visited it is certainly very high on the list especially as a quick and easy way to take a break from the sightseeing.The baguette style beef sandwich complete with thick cut potato wedges was to die for the best ever we had tasted, served in a very timely manner at a very reasonable price. We had the snacks in the exterior eating area and despite the temperature in the upper 30s the air conditioning unit was close enough to have an impact on lowering the temperature where we ate the snack
2
Arrived early in the morning to have breakfast with family. Was extremely disappointed with the service. Waiter was keen to take our orders without telling us that the kitchen is not ready. He took our orders and served us drinks. Later we were told that they ran out of supplies for a particular order. At least they could have been upfront about it and spare us the agony of waiting. With hungry kids and a senior citizen, you can imagine how disappointed we were.
3
Visited on 14thDec2014. Crowded as almost all the tables were occupied, so we were seated outside That's fine but there were so many flies flying hanging around our foods. Which is very irritating!!! Tried the warm chocolate cake, taste average but was served in a big round plate instead of the long rectangular plate which shown on the menu.Hot choco lava oozed out while u cut n it paired well w the vanilla ice cream. But find the Van Creme Brulee was too sweet, haha!!! Find the cake portion is too small. Spend $80+ for 3pax
2
My family and I went around 6 pm for dinner. Nice atmosphere, quite full. There was 6 of us but we got in right away. Our first server was the Manager. He took our order right away and we got our drinks within a few minutes. They were out of mushroom penne. I ordered a 10$ beer and got an 8oz glass. I thought a pint should have applied for that price. We started receiving our meals. First two came, had to wait 3 to 4 minutes for another 2 to come, wait another 5 for the 5th meal, and well for my wifes, I had to get up and ask when it was coming...my daughter had already finished her pasta. Portions 3 out of 5. After the food was delivered the server never came back to ask me for another beer, ask how the food was, nothing. We sat after we finished and they never even brought the check. We got up to pay and noticed a 10% gratuity was added...common throughout Singapore but a very poor business practice, i would not have tipped. Not even a thank you, have a nice day, nothing. Needless to say we wouldn't go back and would not recommend
