Visited over a quick business lunch. At about $15 the set luncheon was great value. However the restaurant doesnot provide much in the way of service. Rice and soup is free flow but self service.

We had the Buta Shogayaki with Iced green Tea which made an ok metal, not to heavy.Spicingvwas correct for us. The servant was correct but not especially kind. I didn't se a smile on his Face.

I'd say this is one good restaurant to dine at when you are in a hurry. Food was well cooked, tasty, and speedy to serve.Fully automatic with touch screen ordering at each table, served to you within the next 5 minutes. Cannot had asked for more.Every portion was all just nice. Not as exquisite as the real deal in Japan, but close to local standard.Will certainly return.PS. Chairs are a little low for bigger chaps. Not for those with a tummy and/or weak legs

We visited the restaurant with my brother who visits this place often with his family. The place was nice and clean and staff were polite and obliging. Orders were placed by ourselves by entering them on a touchscreen which was pretty easy to use and total cost would be shown at the end of order.What impressed me was the food arrived as soon as we placed the order. The quantities were reasonable and taste was great. Would return agai

I always wanted to try this restaurant but every time there was a Long queue during the weekend. Finally I dine on Thursday night and the queue was short. I only waited for 1-2 minutes before I was brought to a table. You can place your order via iPad. The food waiting time was average. The food was average with free hot or old water plus wet tissue.Overall the experience was good. I will not recommend to try.

Location wise is good, on the ground floor. It's more of an "open concept" style restaurant where one can see fully into it from outside. Decor is modern and reasonably comfortable.The well designed menu is pretty extensive too. Prices looks reasonable. About the food......We had 4 different items. The food came in quite fast although restaurant was full. Generally all tasted quite good & we would say it offers fair value for the prices paid. Service-wise, it was attentive & friendly. Definitely a good place for good food, fair value & quick/attentive service.

This is our first visit to Yayoiken Bugis branch, it's small and waited by a handful of staffs which were not too friendly. I ordered Wafu Hamburg and yasai salad, my girl ordered Saba miso teishoku (grilled fish rice set). Drinking water are served free and refillable hot green tea is chargeable at $1.00. The rice set is served with miso soup, but like a lot of casual Japanese dining places, the soup is not covered with lid and turned cold in air con condition fast. My salad was 'flooded' with sesame sauce, and the hamburgs (pork and beef patties) were oily but dry inside. The food is reasonably priced, not more than $20 per item, eg. Rice set that we ordered was $10.90 and my hamburg was $12.90. It must be mentioned somewhere which we missed, because, the Japanese gentleman seated on our right said 'gohan (rice) is free flow' and he had 2 bowls. Not sure but maybe it was the case because the other 3 Japanese men did the same- had 2 bowls of gohan each, self serviced, they all took the empty bowls, and helped themselves with more rice

I dropped by for dinner to avoid crowded places. Most of set meals cost less than 20 dollars and it is pretty reasonable. They serve Japanese style main dish with rice and miso soup. I tried chicken infused with some sweet sauce and it was really tasty. I like this Japanese style set menu which is not too greasy and is always accompanied with vegetable dishes.I will come back next time to try grilled fish

Yayoiken serves inexpensive Japanese food that is of decent quality and at prices that are very reasonable for the rather expensive Singapore. No frills, though - you won't get any raw fish here. You sit down in tables of 2-4 and you can either order with the waitstaff or do it the Japanese way, via the tablet computers (faster and easier) on each table. A typical set meal is the grilled Saba (mackeral) where you get a 150g Saba filleet (half a fish) with miso soup, tofu, and rice (free topups for rice) - all for US$10 (including taxes and service). The quality of the fare is above average, including the nicely done short grain rice. Service is efficient. You do have to pay for tea but water is free.Weekend queues are common so come early
