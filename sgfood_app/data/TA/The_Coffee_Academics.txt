Met a friend here during the day. Great coffee and choice of coffees. Not many staff and many of them too busy to take orders etc. Shame as it was otherwise a great place

Had the crabmeat aglio olio, seafood tomato pizza and crispy fish fillet tacos. Not bad. SERVICE of servers not upto normal standard. Cant see the heart in serving the guests.

The best coffee I’ve ever had in Singapore. No doubt. If you like coffee - this is your place. Breakfast menu great - had the smashed avocado. Great start to a Sunday.

Been there once previously for a coffee which was delicious and interestingly had good service despite it being crowded. This time around my husband and i wanted a nice cuppa after lunchtime. My pet peeve, not to get our order at the same time - no one likes to dine or drink on their own and then have their dining partner's order arrive after the first has cooled off. To add insult to injury the couple who sat down next to us, after we sat down - got both their food and drink before our coffee orders were complete. When we mentioned this to the young waiter, his response was "Oh sorry, but was your coffee good? " We were gobsmacked! Seriously, so we asked for the supervisor to give feedback and his immediate response was "Oh not around, will take time to get hold of her...and oh by the way, so how as your coffee?" He then volunteered to remove the service charge from our order (really not what we were looking for) and of cos, when we paid the bill the service charge was still on it which we paid just so we could get away from a place that obviously does not care to train its wait staff properly. Very disappointing and won't be back again. Oh and i should mention he took my number at my request and told us the manager would definitely call me later...its been about 2 weeks and no call

I am an addict.... of coffee! Having grown up with the coffee culture of northern Europe my taste has evolved from machine drip DE through English, American (very short period :)), Swiss, Italian and Australian. The latter two are my favourites. Great coffee by skilled barista’s in oft great atmosphere managed through independent owners and crew with an understanding of the mix that nakes coffee consumption a moment of happiness.Coffee Academics is getting some of these elements right earning my 4 star. Good coffee, skilled barista, and OK decor. Keep working on service though

If your a coffee lover this is the place for you! I am a massive coffee addict and this place rocks if your into your java! What’s great is not only the selection of coffees but how they pair them with sugar, honey, and alcohol.I also had the crab salad which was fantastic too. Overall a superb place to come and watch the world go by eat great foo

Contrary to several reviews, had a pleasant experience here. The service was prompt and staff were friendly. Coffee was wonderful. Had the traditional breakfast set, was quite tasty, only downside was the price. $25 seems rather steep for a sausage, scrambled eggs, ham and some beans.Will visit again, especially using the entertainer app whereby I get 1 for 1 main course

After read good recommendation, I had come last month. To prove what actually is the unique value & taste the coffee. Creative menu is good for coffee, smart mixing among recipe & taste is good!Nachos was good for snack time. But the atmosphere is a bit formal, so feels like hurry when sit there.Overall, is recommended!Good job guys

1st day of 2018, I learnt a “good” brand not necessarily equals to good services. Your services sucks as the worst I ever had among all the coffee shops I had been! Your coffee is not bad, but we can also find equally good and even better coffee easily in Singapore, so why yours again? It’s the first time and last time I would step into your shops.I was thinking should I waste my time to write down this review as I won’t be their customer ever again. But to the customers who are willing to try your foods and coffees by paying a much higher price at this location in town, deserve what to know and what maybe to prepare their expectations. Unfortunately, my experience in your shop didn’t convince me that you respect and appreciate customer who are willing to pay more to drink an average coffee and food in a premium city location. Establishing a brand is not easy but ruining it could be overnight, especially in hospitality industry. I was surprised to see none from TCA management to respond customer’s negative reviews on TripAdvisor. —————————————————————————————The story:We (2+1) were led to a seat after a while queuing (the shop still have lots available seats). We and our next table placed order at same time for similar foods. 20 minutes after next table received their food, the staff who took order for us came and verified what we ordered and surprisedly 2 out of 3 were wrong. She didn’t make any apologies and we were okay with it and told her to get the right order for us soonest. After another while, the food did not yet come, we received call that few more family members will join us. So I made my way to a staff (seems a person in charge) and asked if they can arrange to get us a larger table. I noticed there are few larger tables next to the cashier were empty:“You should inform us when you came in first time!”, the staff said, impatiently.“Sorry, we only knew as they just called. Can you help to arrange?”“You have to queue separately then”“Sure, we are fine to do another queue. Now there are two guests in queue, so please put us after them okay?”“We will try. But you may not be sitting together.” (WTF?! Why?)“There are some large tables, can you put us on those if they are available?”“We will try”So, I went outside and fetched the family members in. This was after another 15-20 mins. You know what? The $20 pancake was just served and the coffee!! And they didn’t even plan to give us a large table and there were some customers waiting to be seated. Of course we decided to leave. At the check-out, there was still a wrong coffee order on our bill!I noticed there were some customers sitting at the two large tables now. So I asked the staff (who gave us above conversation) why they couldn’t arrange us previously to sit at tables just now? “Are these customers made reservation to these tables?” I asked.“No”“Then why you couldn’t arrange us to sit here just now?”“.... we don’t have many staffs to cover this area...”“You have same staffs now as the time when we came in”“.... we just got approved to use these tables now...”“....” Fine, we are leaving anyway, no points to waste more my time. She thinks the customers are nuts and easily to be fooled, but actually we are not. Customers who love coffee are easy going if you treat them fair and sincerely.Oh, btw, I was told that having a filter coffee needs to wait for 30 mins and that’s normal. Maybe that’s true in TCA but that’s not what I ever had in others

The interior decoration of the cafe looks good and modern. Although the cafe is called coffee academics, but the coffee doesn’t taste good. In fact, it is a bit bitter. I would say the ice water provided taste better. I will give this cafe a miss.
4
Fabulous coffee house with a lovely atmosphere. They do lots of different coffee and food choices are excellent. Surrounded by shopping areas. Easy to find.
3
Service was slow, take ages to even get a glass of water or have your order taken.
food was average and definitely not worth the price.
But place is always crowded.
3
While the food was excellent and signature coffee as well, it would deserve better service. Still if you have plenty of time and don’t mind waiting until you get noticed it’s worth the visit.
3
My rating is 2.5 not 3.This cafe is all about its coffee but I was appalled by the coffee which was served to me. It was lukewarm not even hot! What a disappointment. We also ordered the curly fries and pancake tower. The curly fries were ok. The only thing positive were the pancakes. I expected it to be fluffier but ok the whole it was delicious.If I ever visit again it will be all about the pancakes definitely not the coffee
3
Awesome creativity. Terrible service. I gave this place another try after last time because the coffee was good, but they fell so short I had to leave. Their service is slow as a snail; half of their customers end up leaving before they even get in the door. Improving the service would be 4 stars. Improve prices would be 5.

I know this place from my Singaporean friend. He said this is a nice coffee shop. I went to Coffee Academics at around 5pm a perfect time for having a coffee and a dessert. The 1st impression was an high-end coffee shop which can be seen through its chic decor. Then i entered this coffee shop (because there was no waitress) and sat down. Still, there was no waitress who approach then i wait for a moment to have the menu. We ordered Okinawa (ice and hot) and tower pancake to share. The pancake is big enough not like the usual pancake and fluffy. The pancake is served with a raspberry sorbet (which is sooo niceee), whipped cream, and maple syrup. Okinawa is actually a cappuccino with Okinawa cane sugar, the coffee is strong enough and too sweet

I tease my Singapore friends about the quality of barista coffee available in the city state. Many are stuck on Starbucks (not bad just mediocre).So when a friend suggested we meet at Coffee Academics, I thought I would check it out.I had been years a few years back when it was known as Wild Honey. Then it offered meals for vegetarians and vegans (I'm an omnivore) and the people I met there were not meat eaters.The food was pretty good, about Australian prices (which is expensive that a "local" breakfast costs about a quarter of that charged here). The coffee? It was okay and I could not fault it but I could not say it was great either.This time I tried the cold brew, served in a bottle with a sealed cap.Cold brew has gained quite a following and you'll find it in many cities in many countries. It is supposed to give you a more intense flavour that might be burnt off in the coffee machine.The nice thing about the bottled cold brew is that it is enough for two unless you are a huge coffee consumer.It was very similar to cold brews I've had here in Perth and also in Melbourne. NIce flavour, intense and tasty without bitterness.When it comes to great coffee, it's a combination of machine, the roast, and the barista. I'm used to baristas not serving coffee they made when they think they got the temperature wrong or if it just doesn't look right.That has not happened in Singapore yet.I didn't eat here this time but lots of people around me appeared to be enjoying their meal.Service was good
2
The chic and trendy decor but dismal service spoke volume about charm being deceptive. When I was standing at the entrance waiting to be seated, 3-4 staff passed me by before anyone finally acknowledged me and attempted to seat me. The menu laid before me was disintegrated and far from what I expect from "AN AWARD WINNER FROM HKG" as declared with their sign at the main entrance. When i requested to change seats, the service staff moved my cups of waters with a literal splash on the table and did not bother to clean it up. She had left the menu at the previous table as well. After we got another staff to bring us the menu, he nonchalantly tossed it onto the table on top of the pool of water - this probably explaining how their menu got to the state of disintegration. My friend and I both ordered the Umami Pasta which was synonymous with the description though could be overly spicy for patrons not used to spice. While the taste was acceptable, I had much higher expectations for the presentation which was different for both plates though both looked like the onsen eggs had gone through turbulence while being flown over from Japan perhaps? My plate of pasta even had the ebiko looking like it was blown out from a nose like snot on one side of the plate. Just look at the photo. (And no, in case the management was wondering if we had tossed the pasta before the photograph was taken. NO! the photograph was taken before we sank our fork in). I would have been willing to fork out more money to try their $25 mojito if not for the sloppy service. Thanks but no thanks, for that price tag and service, I am better off suffering some grouchy $4 bak chor mee uncle/auntie who works in some hot hawker centre, and could also have given me Umami mee kia with the minced pork and braised mushroom plated with more pride. And yes, I could have gotten 5 bowls. Call me cheapskate, but it beats suffering hipster staff wannabe who rather be elsewhere on a Sunday afternoon
2
This is not a specialty coffee shop as it looks like. They have a 30k$ Kees van der Westen machine that only brew their house blend which is too dark and bitter. Single origins are reserved for cold brew. Go there for breakfast and latte but if you’re looking for good espresso, don’t
3
Had Breakfast at Scott’s Square for the second day in a row but tried a different restaurant this time. I ordered a classic breakfast consisting of sausage , eggs , bread and fruit with an American coffee. It all came well cooked but nothing special . Price was quite high taking into account portions weren’t particularly generous
2
Really disappointed with the coffee, there are plenty of local coffee roasters which are much better than this👎🏻
1
Really terrible service across the times I've visited over the past year plus.
Coffee is alright, ambience is excellent, but nothing can make up for the horrendously passive-aggressive service attitude across the main outlet at Scotts Sq, as well as its outpost at Raffles City.
3
This place is good for coffee. However, their food selection is limited. If you want to come here and have a proper meal, you might be disappointed.
5
I love this place, so I went to eat 2 days in a roll. The coffee is excellent and the food is unique. I also like the place, it's very chic. I saw they also offer ti have coffee class, so if I have chance, I'll join the class
4
I went for a afternoon tea and dessert at The Coffee Academics. It is a really cozy cafe. They serve main courses and also dessert. Full menu of gourmet coffee and tea.Dessert seems a must try. Pancake tower is really yummy. It is a good place to relax for an afternoon
1
A much hyped place. We went for a family brunch and the only benefit of doubt I can give to the place is the lack of choice of vegetarian food which is well documented. But everything else - quite a shame. From the rudeness in giving us a table to the attitude, stinks of arrogance and brashness. Can't stand inside the hotel. No cutlery available at all even as orders come. No one to listen and serve at all. Ages for food to come - pancakes no less than 45 mins. And at the end of it all, not even value for money. Very expensive pricing for the small quantities dished out. Hope the review helps improve the place.

You have to smile when you walk in here, the interior is diverse, functional, and in itself, entertaining. I like to see a variety of seating options, it has small tables, group tables, benches, etc., so whatever suits your need and your mood, should be catered for. It;s a good use of space, and not at all cramped or cluttered.And there's plenty to look at, with the tasting and demo areas, and the Hand Brew Bar, you should be able to indulge your coffee passion. Not so many power outlets for those that wish to chill and charge, and the WiFi was down when I visited, but there are sufficient free options available in the mall to get around that.Good quality coffee and attentive service, but sadly I didn't eat there yet
4
Went here for brunch. There's a long waiting line already for seats. Had to repeatedly tell the staff that i wanted the regular tables, not the tatami ones but they still gave us the tatami area.Heard other customers complaining why it's taking so long to get orders. Staff is not smiling at all - i felt like they didnt want us there. They cant be THAT tired - it's just 10.30 AM!!!Ordered the smoked salmon on rosti. Good - a bit too salty but otherwise good. And the coffee in the cone is cute, good but not amazingly good.Good to try it once but probably wont go back. Loved the decor, though and the overall look. Good service would have made it so much better. Team needs to train the staff more - we had to repeatedly ask for our order, our syrup, our ice cream, a kid's plate, some water. EVERYTHING
2
One of those restaurants where you don't want to come back anymore, not because of the food and coffee, but because of poor customer service. We've waited for almost 40 minutes with no food or drinks served. And when I asked why, they said there was a miscommunication with the kitchen which meant they did not place our order until I asked. When we got my daughter's breakfast, we complained that the eggs were raw, but they said that was how it was supposed to be. Finally, I asked if they can remove the service charge because I was very unhappy with the service, but they just smiled and said they could not do that. Quite arrogant staff.
3
Went there for breakfast nice looking place quite hyped, waited to be seated sat outside on a small table order took a while to get to me and actually order my meal and coffee , coffee was good but smoked salmon rosti combo was terrible salmon was icy cold out of fridge rosti was crisp dried out and my congeal egg and fish roe very bad.Overall experience poor service so slo
2
This is my 2nd visit and 2nd review, hence it will be short and sweet. Firstly, as per my fellow diner, coffee is good. That's all! Service and food still sucked.
5
Came here every day for breakfast on our recent trip to Singapore, the coffee is the best, and the Academics Breakfast is worth every bite, it's off the main road so it's quiet and the staff are great
4
Coffee was absolutely divine, I ended up with two cups all to myself. One cup was with manuka honey, another was with pepper and agave. We also had pancakes tower, food took quite long and service was really slow. Would recommend going there for coffee!
2
What is the point of dining together if you aren't going to get served at the same time? We received (in five minute intervals): my entree, my coffee, my daughter's coffee, my daughter's entree. The coffee was very good. The food was decent - but very small portions given the extortionate price. If you are going to pay 20USD for avocado toast, shouldn't they at least give you all (or at least half) an avocado? The toast was my second choice, as CA was out of the seafood croquette. My daughter at the smoked salmon served on overdone beet/potato rosti and topped with a poached egg whose white was still translucent and still quivering. Though there was no line, we were forced to sit outside (in the mall). Service was rude and dismissive, and though it is a sit down restaurant (with sit down prices), you need to go inside and pay at the cash register
2
Poor Service.Rude Staff. Dropped in here post lunch at Wild Honey The staff told us we couldn't sit at a table if we just ordered coffee (this was at 2:30pm)I guess they don't prize their coffee enough to think it is worth sitting there!We then ordered 5 coffees including their advertised special (coffee in a cone) and got stools by the bar as they suggested (while they found us a table, which they didnt - we spent 10-15 mins line and then 10 mins post getting the coffee at the bar counter as advised by the staff) but then were rudely told to get out because we got the coffee in take out cups from their store. they actually asked the girls in our group to get up from the bar stools and leave. very strange experience. perhaps it was the owners friends they wanted to seat and they had no other options
2
I was shown to a table and then ignored for 25 minutes. The place was not particularly busy. I tried to catch the eye of one of the three wait staff, but to no avail. Eventually I got board and left to find somewhere that wanted my business!
4
We were actually heading for Wild Honey (following research done on Singapore's best breakfasts) and found Coffee Academics! What a find! Fantastic breakfast menu, and thankfully for us, great coffee.We visited twice, and I got the academics breakfast on both occasions. The staff are great, and the quality of the food is very good. Atmosphere is lovely, helped by a great playlist playing in the restaurant!I think the coffee is well worth the price, though at $25, I do think the academics breakfast should be a few dollars cheaper, hence the one star dropped for value for money
4
We were a group of 4 visiting The Coffee Academics at Scotts Square for brunch. It was about 10 in the morning. The outlet didn't operate with full staff at that time so certain sectors of the restaurant/cafe were closed. We would have chosen the sofa seats inside but had to make do with one of the outdoor tables as there was already a small crowd.The drinks did not disappoint. We ordered a hot Jawa and a pot of hot Honeybush and Lemongrass tea. Both were much to our liking.We also ordered an Academics Breakfast, a Crispy Fish Fillet Tacos, and two sets of Smashed Avocado on Toast. The Academics Breakfast was nothing special. The Fish Fillet Tacos had too little tacos and too much curly fries. However, the Avocado on Toast was very delicious
5
I like to try coffee in every country I visit and this didn't disappoint. The coffee shop itself had an appeal that made me want to go in and I'm glad that I did.I tried the Jawa and the Okinawa and the flavours of each were delightful. The staff were friendly and the service was good-not too long but long enough to indicate that care in preparation was taken. I'd definitely recommend a visit
5
Hunting for great coffee has become an obsession. This hunt finished with a great experience and a wonderful coffee. I like a Long Black. While they made it a little long - more like an Americano - the underlying flavor was worth it. My friend had a chilled soy latte - her smile told the whole story. Worth a visit.
4
The Manuka Coffee tasted delicious.
The food portion was generous and good for sharing. The pancake tower taste good, the fish taco was really good too.
5
Like This coffee joint in Hong Kong. The latte was very good , taste and smell nice too. The cafe offered also offer a good list of other beverages like juices and tea.
3
Located at Scotts Square Orchard, The Coffee Academics is not a very crowded place to have coffee at weekdays. Nice place with relaxing ambiance. Tried Okinawa Coffee there, and it was good. Different kind experience of coffee than what other coffee shop offers.
2
The coffee is good but don't ever dine there. Ordered Le salmon royal - the Rosti which the salmon sits on is so hard I had trouble breaking it with my fork. The Rosti is so burnt the colour is almost black- really quite a turn off. Only 2 miserable piece of salmon on top with a few strands of sprouts. The portion is way too small for a sgd23 brunch! Service is really slow, can tell they are short handed. We also ordered the pancake tower. Was told that it would take 30-40 min. We checked after 1 hour and was told that it would take another 10min! My 3yo was so hungry by then we had to cancel the order and just go find something else for him.
4
Brunch and lunch time were impossiblw to get a seat on weekends however this time we came by in the evening for a post dinner wind down. Needless to say, coffee selection was rather wide with the additonal choice of hot choc , a few teas etc.to our surprise was to see wide choice of alcohol. food selection at this time of day was also available. Which we thought would only be restricted to lunch hours. Staff seemed shorthanded at a quiet time. Cannot imagine during the peak periods. We had the dessert - egg tartlet coated with chocolate and came with strawberries and raspberri
3
I prefer going on weekdays as it is less crowded and I can take my time. They previously had a "coffee of the week" promo and I had a Hawaiian red sea salt foam iced latte. It was really good. But they have since stopped serving it. Nevertheless, the food is good and the atmosphere (when it isn't too crowded) is actually quite good for having your coffee fix and relaxing with a book.
5
This coffee joint is every coffee fiend's dream come true. The iced mocha was divine, staff were prompt and definitely reasonably priced. I mean, if you want more than your average run of the mill coffee, then you have to swing by this place. LOVE IT
4
I went to this cafe at first was really impressed with their espresso based coffee, unlike other cafe in singapore thats serve burn and bitter taste espresso. Went back the second time was a bit dissapointment the barista lady cant make coffee. I love the coffee from the barista guy with lots of beard. Cant say academic when they have not the standard quality between barista.
5
Went my daughter and husband to this place. Immediately we get a table at a very weird location - near the steps. My girl was very amazed with the eagle/owl decorations at the cashier (I forget what is that). Overall a good place to hang out without children. Menus are ok not much varieties and nothing really great. Drinks are ok too.
4
I went to the one in Raffles City to try this new cafe. I had a Flat white with soy milk and scrambled eggs on toast. I was pleasantly surprised how the coffee tasted not the usual bitter tasting one I always had or a tasteless water downed coffee from other popular coffee joints. Yes it's true it's on the pricey end. However, you really pay for quality food don't you? I rather pay this much for my great tasting coffee than pay for a sweetened not much tasting drink from that popular American coffee joint. Highly recommended for someone who loves coffee
5
Their piccolos and cortados superb. I'm a regular. Best I've had in Singapore. For coffee aficionados, I highly recommend The Coffee Academics on Scott's Road.

今天下午到店內點了飲料和蛋糕等了約30分鐘餐點遲遲都沒有送來。
隔壁的两三桌客人离开了又来新客人饮料歺點都送来了我们才觉得奇怪。为什么我们的东西一直没有送来？ 才詢问服务人员。
其他服务人员也並没有马上做我们的订单。过约5分钟才问我们是谁为我们点餐？
原来第一位服务的人员並没有为我们下任何订单😓让我们坐在这里空等約30分钟。
这位服务人员最後终于出现了，她向我们解释(it is a system problem not my problem )是系统出了问题。一直解釋东解释西，（並説不是她的问题)……直到最後她才說了抱歉。
這短短的對話完全感觉不到任何有诚意的道歉。我向她询问经理是谁。她還得意的告訴我，我就是店内的经理。OMG。😓
之后有其他人员送餐来也向我們说抱歉。我們也對他們說：他們的表現很好不關他們的事。所以不用說抱歉。
態度，绝对比那位经理诚意十足。
最后要结帐时其他服务人员告知free of charge 我們還是堅持要付款。
原因是⋯我們肯定其他的人員的服務。
並且無法接受這位沒誠意的經理的道歉。所以我們堅持付款。
她還在客人看得到的位置比手劃腳。感覺上在說她還可以做什麼？⋯⋯
very bad attitude😓
妳！當然可以做更多。頁正檢討自己的疏失！並且誠意的向客人道歉。
(同一段時間)…為什麼其他Staff都可以做到正確的點單，正確的出餐? 身為經理的你確做不到？还一直推托是系统出问题。系統真的出了問題嗎？
如果你有再次確定。並且觀察現場的狀況。你應該早就發現客人訂單出問題了吧？
而不是客人在30分钟之后主動向服務人員詢問我們的餐點在哪裡？可不可以請你們查一下？
給別人負面的評價非常容易。經營者和客人都應該有正確的態度。
我們完全不覺得這餐免費會讓我們會開心。完全不需要！～只希望你有更正確的態度來經營這家店。真心对待服务任何客人。
✨重要在於你的態度。！！✨
但是⋯肯定的是～我們絕對不會再來光顧。

Lovely coffee, and Churros (though a bit oily). Ordered nothing else. But we should have order more. Food from other tables looks delicious and amazing. Greattt friendly service...
2
After a long family vacation we went here for a family brunch. In search for a Bacon & Eggs brunch cafe we googled and found this place.We loved the ambiance and atmosphere but felt the cost of our meals and coffee was way over the top. We actually googled and was recommended this place only to find they do not serve bacon!!! In Asia where they eat pork they do not serve bacon at this joint! Plus Avacado and Toast will cost you $22!! Yikes.Totally underwhelming experience. :-(International traveler that regularly gets to Singapore - me thinks I will not be going back
4
A little way from the busy Orchard road but a nice ambience anyway ... good snacks and coffees and teas. Didn't try the food but the kids loved the very differently designed French fries ... try the lemongrass tea or ginger and peach ... hot is great on a rainy day in Singapore in a cold AC mall
2
Food is definitely good. Chefs are friendlier than the service staff.Service staff is very curt and rude. They take orders with a demeaning expression. It all started w asking us how many pax then the order taking.This is an example:I ordered ice lavender earl grey and the waitress gave a very rude expression and said they don't do ice. I said u do ice and I've came here many times. And she replied w a curt face "okaaaaaaay". Been here several times and the waiters and waitresses really need to learn service.Chefs on the other hand carries a smile on their face.Wld I recommend here? Yes for food but no for service. Bear w the service and the food can cover that bad experience
3
Been meaning to try this place for quite a while and finally got around to doing so today after lunch. No queue on a weekday. We had 2 coffees and a piece of cake for just over $30. The (Okinawa) coffee was good but not exceptional and not really worth the $8 price tag. This place really seems to be well presented and marketed, but the coffee is about the same as anywhere else
2
The concept, design and atmosphere are great. The coffee was served a bit cold. They forgot my dish which arrived 10 minutes later than the rest. On the table you wont see sugar, salt and pepper, when we requested tabasco they gave us one with maybe couple of drops remaining and said this is all what we have, while we saw other tabascos on other tables half full.
4
I visited here on my last day in Singapore when visiting my best friend. The coffee was really good and the food was awesome as well. I liked the variety of coffee and the breakfast menu was great. The scrambled eggs with crayfish and caviar and pancakes were to die for
3
The food and coffee wasn't too bad at Scott's Square, though pricey.We were attended to and served quite promptly, even on a busy Sunday afternoon. .However, I noticed that the preparation of food could be done with more hygiene in mind. I was sitting near the counter and I saw a staff behind the counter tossing and mixing salad with his bare hands without any gloves on and in between multitasking (e.g opening and closing the refrigerator door etc) which may lead to cross contamination, especially when salads are eaten raw.Nonetheless it was quite a pleasant experience lunching at The Coffee Academics. Quite a cool place to chill out with pals
4
One of the best handcrafted coffee! Fish Taco was great, pancakes soso. Ordered the Ethiopia Guji Shakiso, highly recommended.
1
Quality of food is as bad as the service you will receive from the staff ...
Do not recommend this place at all !!
1
Too expensive, poor quality of food (lunch)
Pizza horrible. Portion very small
Service average.
Coffee is good.
4
- Nice coffee place with open spaces
- Has a lot of walk-by shops on the same floor
- Coffee is a bit pricey
- Good service
4
I've passed this cafe before, but never had enough time to visit it. This time we came for on Sunday for the branch, but just to be fare the restaurant doesn't have special branches as many other do. The food was good, it's not just a coffee place as you can think initially. Prices more on expensive side, but it's pretty normal for Singapore restaurant. The special feature of the place is coffee, you can find a lot of interesting information about coffee in decoration of the place, but I've never tried one, so not sure how good it is here.
4
"The Coffee Academics" is a great place to finish up some work, or socialize with your friends and family. It is located on the first floor at Scotts Square just on the corner of the "Famous" Orchard Road in Singapore. You must try their "Manuka Honey Latte" for a different cup of coffee.
2
A great place for coffee and desserts, however staff lack chemistry with one another and service was bad. Request for 3 hot and 1 cold water took ages to come, and they didn't even get it right. Request for chilli sauce also took ages and ended up getting tomato sauce. The funny thing is that the waitress whom I made my request to wasn't the one who brought me the water or other items
3
You have to search for good espresso coffee around Orchard Road, so we tried this one, which is one floor up within Scott Square, a couple of hundred metres of Orchard itself. It's tucked into a corner of the floor, surrounded by shoe shops. The venue itself is pleasantly cool, with a dark decor. The coffee was OK without being exceptional but at $6.50 (plus another $1 for soy milk), this is pricey for Melbournians (who do know their coffee). The menu has a reasonable range of choices (we were there for breakfast). The service was good

This is a great place to stop for a coffee or tea. Specialty coffees are not cheap (S$ 7.50 and small), but not terrible considering that Starbuck's down the street on Orchard is S$6.90.Seating is not ideal- tables are on top of each other.Service was quick and fairly responsive, though not terribly friendly.Worth a stop if you are in the mall and want a break

If u have time to spend and money to spare. It will be a great coffee place for gatherings. The crowd is massive on Saturday afternoon and the wait is approximately 1 hour? The staffs were super nice to give the heads up. So we went away and returned 2 hours later for their legendary pancake. Pancake is very rich and filling. 3 fluffy pancakes topped with berries and snowy sugar. Comes with cream, ice cream and maple syrup. Absolutely yummy for the sweet tooth.

The Coffee Academics have some great coffees on offer, using a variety of brewing methods. It's expensive compared to run-of-the-mill coffee, but should be appreciated by coffee lovers. Also have great food on the menu. Definitely worth a try.

I'll admit we're coffee snobs so we were excited to try this place after being recommended it by someone. We decided to try some of there specialty coffees, my partner had the Agave one with cracked pepper and asked the waitress how sweet it was as he didn't want it too sweet. She replied it wasn't very sweet, it was more spicy. Unfortunately when it came out it was rot your teeth sweet. The most disappointing thing is that both the coffees were so weak you couldn't actually taste any coffee. Two coffees came to over $17 and just was not worth it at all. The cafe is very on trend with its menu and its decor. It's a cool concept they just aren't deliverin

A great place to chill over a coffee or tea. Even the kids can enjoy a hot cuppa like the babycino with tasty marshmallows on top! I love the fish tacos which comes with a generous portion of curly fries on the side. The fish is not fried, but juicy and moist and goes really well the tacos

their coffee is awesome in terms of taste and presentation. their food menu looks amazing. but that's the problem. it only looks good but doesn't taste good. the food is bland and needs a lot more flavor. the food doesn't come cheap but for the price you pay isn't close to what you get. the service is pretty decent

Went for lunch. 1 hour 45 mins to finish. Food came at very different times . Took ages and when it came we left most of it. Fish n chips hard and salty . Sandwich greasy and salty. Our worst lunch experience in Singapore for along time. Never going back, except for a coffee perhaps - that was goo

The Coffee Academics is located in a corner on the second level of Scotts Square and it’s not that difficult to find with it’s modern chic, black and white exterior. The cafe provides a working space equipped with free WIFI and power sockets for the road warrior. Interestingly, it does look like a laboratory as well!There are a few special espresso-based coffees available and we pick the Okinawa $7.50, caffe latte with Okinawa dark brown sugar. Real good coffee. Conclusion, is this a coffee place worth visiting? Definitely a yes but if you are on a budget, do note that the prices are slightly on the steep side. At least you are paying for some decent good food Read more about our dining experience on darrenbloggie.co

Ambience - Nice. Quite cosy and relax also because the mall is kind of quiet.Food - ok... Ordered a pancake, quite huge portion and it's thick! Personally I still prefer something crispy outside, soft and fluffy inside; but this one the inner part is thick and kind of solid. The curly fries is good! Pizza was ok too. Coffee - Not bad. They also serves different brew/blends of coffee. If you are a coffee enthusiast you might like it. Price - slightly on the higher side.

I did choice this cafe as it was near to hotel, I find out by TP here. The cafe is just on the first, cosy environment with comfy chair what u can sit and chill your time with ur friends. But the food is not the best, we ordered pancake and actually I was a bit disappointed as the texture was too much consistency to be pancake for like carrot cake densidity, there was not butter flavour on it, and after this the next day we did have coffee on the sky park ce la ve for the price. But still I would not mind to go again in long periods afterwards

Like any academic, this place speaks a good game but reality is very different.Came here for a coffee 1st experience + breakfast. It started strong as cafe layout is open & creative... then I sat down. If your over 6ft, your legs won't fit under the table. Drinks: I order the Blue Mountain with air press & as someone who normally does expresso or short macchiato's I thought tap water had more flavour; partner had a tea with great flavour but not hot enough.Food was likewise mixed. One dish of crab & avo salad was good; but my scrabbled eggs with crayfish was dry & lacked flavour. Not a lot to recommend except it looks pretty.
2
Ordered Hot Chocolate and Mountain Blue Coffee, quite disappointed. Drinks are quite cold. Egg Benedict served also below expectation.
5
Had coffee here several times, always enjoyable.
Churros and muffins delicious, all meals which came out of the kitchen looked very well presented. Definitely recommend.
4
We tried their pancake tower, the academic breakfast and croque madame. Great choices for brunch. Do come before 11am to get choice seating.
3
We had breakfast here as we wanted to try the Academics breakfast. It was OK, not great. My son tried the pancakes and he loved them. The coffee was very good, and the staff is nice.I felt the chairs were kind of unconfortable, so I would maybe return but just for coffee
2
The coffee (flat white) was pretty avergae. Not the specialness the price would.lead you to expect. And cheesecake was Ok but over sweet.Service also OK. Essentially it's a good looking, young and trendy coffee bar but just not quite special enough to rate the hype

It was a Tuesday afternoon, after lunch, so the place was at most running at 40-50% capacity. Most tables were already seated and served so by the time we got in, they had at most 2-3 tables to attend to. Staff were decidedly more interested in doing great shows of doing nothing, walking about, and ignoring flailing hands. We weren't the only table who had trouble getting someone to take our orders. Actually witnessed another customer from another table of 7 get up and asked a waiter, who was mere 80 metres away, to go over. This was after the girls gave up waving their menu and hands in the air. When we finally did get ours orders in - 3 drinks and 2 desserts, including their signature Meteorite - we waited. And waited. And waited. Let's just say that 3 other tables, including the said table of 7, got all their mains on the table and ours saw nary a sight of our sweet treat. It's totally baffling that it took over 30 mins for us to get the first plate. After all, isn't the dessert station separate from the mains? I was really expecting a culinary complexity but it was just two balls of ice cream, one admittedly coated, but still, I was trying to wrap my head around the idea that it took so long to deliver ice cream to us. Did they lovingly handcraft the ice-cream from Alpine snow?Another 10 minutes before our waffles arrived and again, looking at it, you start to wonder if someone in the kitchen had passed our orders; it was just waffles, with a scoop of ice cream and probably pre-cut berries. Also, we weren't served water in all the 60 minutes we wasted there. The Coffee Academics is truly the place where service, time and good food goes to die. I don't know how this joint made it to Buzzfeed's top 25 list. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who expects a minimum level of service at their price point.2 desserts cost over $50 which could have been better spent and enjoyed elsewhere, even the hawker centre. The dismal service marred the experience but I can still objectively tell you that the food (or at least the dessert) ain't great. Google online and you will find a couple of similar opinions from respectable food bloggers. Coffee is the only saving grace and perhaps, that's what they should just do. If there was a choice, I would rate TCA a negative score for service. The only time I was glad with it was when the bill came in under a minute. Thanks but we wouldn't want to stay even if you let us

After having a pleasant breakfast experience at The Coffee Academics (TCA) @ Causeway Bay, I was happy to visit the branch at Scott Square. Spacious , modern and beautiful setting . The aroma of coffee wafted throughout the cafe . I ordered the cappuccino with skinny milk . It was delicious ! It had the complicated taste required of a good coffee. It did not taste 'fruity' which to me 'fruity' means sourish and stale. The coffee came in a big serving . The prices were inexpensive , perhaps costing a little more than Starbucks . We ordered the salted caramel peanut butter cheesecake from the refrigerator . It was good enough . At TCA, their coffee is the star attraction.A wonderful place to hang out with friends on a quiet afternoon or to take a break from shopping . I will come back again if I am in this area.

Can't say much as we only had tea and coffee here apart from the fact that our 2 drinks cost us about $20. I had some kind of lemongrass tea (not bad) and my friend had the manuka coffee (he didn't know what manuka was and didn't think it tasted different from regular honey). Sure the ambience is nice and the staff relatively polite (even though it was a busy Friday night) but not sure if I'll be going back for overpriced drinks any time soon

#Singapore recently has seen a proliferation of coffee establishments, a good deal of them in the last 4 - 5 years. They’re all over. To many, it’s a good thing to have a choice, apart from the Buckstars of the world. To me, it validates the growing of a true coffee culture, and how, by sheer fascination, the wave is reaching the same levels as that of fine wine in our daily lives.#TheCoffeeAcademics or TCA, located at #ScottsSquare, in the #OrchardRoad area, takes the coffee experience way up the bar. This Hong Kong based chain has brought their knowledge of the bean to Singapore, and it is as delightful here as it is back there. Hong Kong has, in my opinion, the broadest palates in Asia, with tastes ranging from the absurd to the absolute sublime. Even before the handover, HK has authentic fine dining, as well as amazing street food, way before we took to eating delicious hot noodles on tight sidewalks, sitting on plastic stools. Very cosmo. Very sophisticated. Now TCA is bringing on the palate swagger with their coffee and in the best way possible to Singapore.The interiors are unobtrusive and divided into different areas of a huge unit at the mall. There’s a coffee bar, where you circle the barista and his ‘stage’ of paraphernalia, similar to a sushi bar counter & sushi chef, where your coffee is brewed in front of you and served with a big smile. Quiet coffee house cool, I would describe it.Major bragging rights are also in order at TCA - they have their own farm of 100% Panama Arabica at Baruffee Estate, Boquete, Panama, located 1900 meters above sea level in the Baru Volcano area. Talk about terroir. Education is just as important to drinking coffee as it is with wine, and no doubt, TCA also excels at this. It’s not about buying a fashion or food brand anymore; it’s knowing all about what you are buying. The staff are pleasantly well trained & knowledgeable, and very willing to advise you on how they will brew your cup for you. The customer experience doesn’t stop there. All of the accoutrements necessary, are waiting for you to select, for your drinking pleasure. These are not just your industrial sized espresso machines or grinders, but it’s the first place for me to see my Aeropress in a cafe alongside a Chemex, Clever Cip and siphons. The menu is simple and great, all items compatible with the star of the show - the coffee. From a range of well made breakfasts, to their delicious signature TCA HK egglet with mango, salted egg custard sauce, and a splendid milk tea gelato, heaven waits at the end of every spoonful. Egglets take me back to my grade school days in Causeway Bay, where I would run outside the school when the bell rang for recess, with my friends, across to the shop that made these mini eggs with cream in a cast iron in minutes. Yummmmm.I could go on and on. Needless to say, if you’re in the area, and you want the best coffee experience in Singapore, you can do no better than to go to The Coffee Academics

Tried TCA in Scott's Square for the first time. High expectations, big disappointment. Ordered Waldorf kale salad, but only half of what was listed on the menu was put in the salad (fine beans and walnuts nowhere to be found). Asked for jamon iberico to be added, but they gave us steak instead. There was a gap of 30 minutes between my wife's miso cod risotto and my iberico pizza. My wife's tea cup had sticky handle. The only redeeming item was the coffee, but not worth the aggravation. Overpriced menu for the quality of the food. The kitchen seemed staff by young hands doesn't seem to be well run. Not going back to TCA again

In case you want a break , to plan the day, worth a visit. Good service, decent options. Enjoyable ambience.

Has very good coffee and a range of tasty deserts. But the service was slow even though the restaurant wasn't very full

Went for a late brunch. They had already run out of juice, sausages and the acai berry bowl. Ordered the chicken pot pie and eggs Benedict. The pot pie was good although a bit dull as it was just the chicken and sauce, without any vegetables, potatoes, etc. The eggs took over 35 minutes to arrive and would get a one star - both eggs were overcooked, the toast they were on was soggy and difficult to cut. The amount of ham served with the eggs was a joke - not even 10gms. Their coffee is very good but would not visit for their food. Service was also quite mediocre.
3
We visited for breakfast on a Friday morning. The restaurant occupies a large space with somewhat confused decor but it was not uncomfortable.The food was alright - we ordered the Academics breakfast (essentially your standard American style breakfast but being an Asian chain perhaps, the serving of toast was really small) and the pancake stack (nice and fluffy inch thick Japanese style pancakes - but we had to wait an hour before they were served!).Now the service - our actual server, an amiable young man, was attentive and very polite. But on the whole the service was poor for us because:1. On arrival 5 minutes before opening time, we were completely ignored by the female server who was prepping the tables outside. When we enquired as to whether they were open and what time they opened, we got a monosyllabic response each time (basically 'no' and 'nine). Our server probably noticed this and immediately approached us to welcome us into the cafe.2. Coffee and the Academics breakfast was served about 10-15 minutes after we ordered (there were two other tables occupied at the time). 3. At about 930am, our server informed us that we would have to wait a little longer for our pancakes as the batter wasn't ready or had to be prepared anew (it wasn't clear). We were somewhat surprised as we expected prep like that to be done before opening time. We weren't in a hurry so we said fine. What we weren't prepared for was another 30 minute wait.We don't think any of the above is acceptable for a cafe located in an upscale mall; in particular one that charges S$19 (USD14) for pancakes.We paid S$60 (USD44) for our breakfast. Don't go if you aren't prepared to spend (much) longer than you anticipated for your meal

One of my favourite cafes in Singapore, it is centrally located in Scott's square so perfect to unwind after shopping. The coffee is quite good and they serve decent snacks. It is a little more pricey than other coffee shops but the value for money is good.

Location: You wouldn't just pass by this cafe; you'd have to know it's there for you to go there. It's on the second floor of Scotts Plaza. Lifts are available so ok for prams and kids.Ambience: Great ambience, they have different table seatings (up high, down low, casual, group, etc). Their staff looked very hipster and funky so the vibe was good.Food: We didn't really have meals but looking at the menu, it looks great and very modern.Coffee: Great coffee - probably the best coffee i've had in Singapore - if you're used to melbourne coffee then there's not many places in Singapore to go to. paying $6.50 for a coffee you'd be having very high expectations of what you're drinking. Their normal coffee cup is bigger than normal though. Cakes look inviting. We bought the lemon meringue and it wasn't as good as Zumbo's although flavour was good, the texture was a bit of a gelatinous texture.Service: Poor service though, we were standing at the front for a while even before they somewhat recognised we wanted to go into the cafe. Then I had to get my own menus then I had to figure out myself how I'm ordering (do i go to the counter or do they take my order at the table) - this was after 20 minutes of looking at the menu; you'd think that they would ask me at the 10 min mark at least.Value for Money: probably more on the expensive side but would I try it again - I probably would as I'm curious as to how their food tastes like

Was pleasantly surprised at the cafe in Singapore. It is big, with lots of seats. The coffee was surprisingly better than the one served in Hong Kong. The food menu was extensive. Ordered the cakes and pancakes and they did not disappoint. Service was also good. Location is central. Definitely will recommend this place and will definitely come again and again
5
Even though we had to queue on a wet Saturday afternoon - the staff efficiently cleared tables took our coffee order and delivered food quickly from the kitchen. Next to the Grand Hyatt in Scott's Square this is the best place for the international traveller to get their caffeine fix
4
Nice new addition to the Singapore coffee scene. We had the blood orange affogato and the agave nectar latte with black pepper. Interesting tastes I have not had before. Cool place to sit too. Just had lunch so didn't eat but definitely coming back for the cakes which look awesome.
4
Lovely location and ambiance. Food was a little pricey, paying S$22 for a small margarita pizza and S$24 for a pasta carbonara This place is known for its coffee, but having just come from a 3 week trip from Italy, I cannot say that I enjoyed my capaccino
3
Nice food and environment, good place to sit for hours and catch up with friends as the food won't be serve that quick (eg: a simple pancake took 45mins).
4
There was a queue when we came, but it moved quite fast Seating can be a bit srage thog=q. The coffee was good. Big food menu and also nice snacks like churrios. Ati in a all, a nice way to spend the afternoon.
3
I like their food menu. healthy waldorf salad with only a mini slice of walnut barely qualifying it be mentioned in the mention.
Had american breakfast the last time I was there and the homemade baked beans wasn't bad.
5
Great place for Sunday brunch. They serve up excellent food and great coffee. Try their Okinawa latte, flavorful and aromatic. Pancakes are fluffy. Eggs Sur Le Plat and Eggs Benedict are fantastic. Must have.
4
It's a great place to have a meal and catch up with friends over a meal and drinks. The menu is varied and the lunch special worth a try. Coffee was alright. The special dessert was generous though a tad expensive, better sharing the egg tablet special dessert. Service was polite and attentive
3
I popped in to take a look at this venue as had read a lot about it being the place for a coffee, unfortunately my take out cappuccino was Luke warm, 3/4's full and thus I left hard done by!!The venue looks great but feel it's not the best for take away coffee which was a shame!
3
There was a queue when we reached however, we didn't have to wait long for our table. We ordered ice dripped coffee with the breakfast set. The beef taco that we ordered turn out to be a big piece of taco with the meat on top instead of small individual tacos wraps. The pancake tower is delicious but was expensive at SGD19
4
Went to The Coffee Academics in Hong Kong and was quite excited to find out they have opened in Singapore. The Singapore outlet is a lot more upmarket than the Hong Kong ones. Loved the decor and ambiance. Tried the Okinawa Cafe Latte and the Mocha and both were good! Will definitely visit again
4
Since it was my first visit, we had 2 drinks each. The coffee served was good and the presentation was modern. Would recommend having the march special with coconut flakes. The decor was nice as well, lots of seating capacity in an informal setting. However, some of their 'signature' drinks were not available. I dont understand how can you not have a signature menu item not available. A customer spends some time making up his mind, only to be told that he cant have it 
2
We were in a hurry to leave but wanted to give their cakes a try so ordered a takeaway red velvet along with the bill. The bill and the takeaway didn't arrive after a good ten minutes so we went to queue at the cashier alongside others who couldn't wait to leave.We feedback to a waiter about the bill and the cake and he roughly stuffed one slice in a box and tilted it into the brown bag and tilted the bag again! Surprised, hubby and I opened the bag to find the cake squahed (duh....).We queued another ten minutes for the bill.The crayfish scrambled eggs was tasteless, caviar was a fake and toast wasn't any good. Burnt citrus lemon was refreshing but I've tasted better at kopitiam in Singapore.Hubby had eggs benedict that was tasty but coffee was diluted.They had nice ambience though
