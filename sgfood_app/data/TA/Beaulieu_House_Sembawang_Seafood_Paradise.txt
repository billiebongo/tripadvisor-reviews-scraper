Set on a hill overlooking the water, Beaulieu House is located inside Sembawang Park, a nice, green space and a favorite spot for families and couples to come and relax. We had a nice Chinese lunch but it was nothing special.

This restaurant is very unassuming so you can feel at ease showing up in your casual clothes. The decor is colonial and there are sections with or without aircon. Prices are reasonable.

We did a Round Island day tour with lunch included. Lunch was a set menu Chinese. So good! Service was friendly and lots of history in the venu! I would definitely recommend it.

Took a stroll on the Sembawang Beach and noticed this restaurant with british colony design and decided to head in for dinner. There are variety of international cuisines and air-condition. Price is abit expensive though.

Lunch as this restaurant was an inclusion in a round island tour on which I'd booked. I admit that I was more impressed with the history of the building and the fact that the Singaporean National Parks, was keeping this part of Singapore's history than I was with the lunch. So many buildings even since I last visited seem to have disappeared. According to information given, the restaurant operators lease the building from the government department.If you visit, I hope you similarly appreciate the history of the building, too ...it added to my appreciation of the meal. Our meal, about seven dishes were placed on the lazy Susan and we managed without any problems to take some of each without any problems at all. My group were all from Australia. We were each given a bowl of fried rice and a cup of Chinese tea. The assortment included Sweet and sour fish, Chilli chicken, Prawns in batter, steamed seasonal vegetables - to name just some.As we were nearing the finish of our meal, an attendant came around offering more fried rice and, during the meal, our cups of tea were topped up regularly. One of the group was vegetarian and he didn't indicate any difficulty in being well fed. The quality of the food was quite good.The restaurant is located on the strait and to go it, one walks through magnificent well kept parkland. Obviously a great place for a celebration of some kind or a wedding.I'm pleased it was a inclusion on the tour as, being a casual explorer in Singapore, I doubt I would have found the place by myself

It has always been a treasure to have such heritage building to be serving delish Chinese Western fares for ages.Very popular with families and shipyard workers nearby for their good mix of selection.And large green space for kids :-) and maybe catch Malaysia cellphone networks ? :-

My wife read about this restaurant and we decided to check it out.After a short pleasant walk through Sembawang Park amidst mature trees, we arrived at the restaurant. It is situated in an old colonial building that overlooks the sea. Lovely and relaxing.One can choose between Asian and Western cuisine and the prices are on the low/ moderate end.We had the crispy fish skin fried with salted egg for starters (really crisp and tasty) and it set the tone for the rest of our meal. The lady fingers were crunchy and fresh. The pork (sweet sour pork) and the diced chicken in bean paste were succulent.The portions were reasonable for the price.The service staff were attentive

A lovely restaurant in a beautiful French colonial house in a park with a beautiful view to the ocean. The staff were very friendly and the food simply delicious. Service was top notch. Need I say more? Worthy of a special occasion or just a lunch

Beaulieu House is a quaint but tired colonial building set within Sembawang Park with a view of the Straits of Johor. They serve a mix of local and simple western food which is nothing to write home about. Simple fare at restaurant prices.

I have visited this place for lunch and dinner on a different day. We ordered Fish Head Curry for lunch and thought we should try their western food for dinner. But very disappointed with western food especially the beef, very dry and hard.

Pretty, colonial style restaurant in a beautiful setting within a park, overlooking the Straits of Johor. We visited here for lunch as part of a full day tour and found the food tasty and plentiful.

Nice view and environment in colonial house setting. Nostalgic and building has rich history. Food wise, ordered the normal Chinese food, steam fish, vegetables, ee fu noodles, fried rice, Marmite pork ribs. Small portions. When food came, it was really small. So I wouldn't give a thumbs up for value for money.

Had our lunch here after a walk at the Sembawang Park. Food is good and we loved what we ordered. There is an air con section and a non--air con section of the restaurant.We ordered sambal lady's finger, stir fry asparagus and marmite chicken. All is very yummy.They do serve western food as well but we did not try.

This is a nice restaurant tucked away in a corner of the Sembawang Park. It was housed in a bungalow known as the Beaulieu House, with Victorian style ironworks and intricate plaster details. The building itself was granted conservation status in 2005. The food served here is quite authentic and local. If you cannot stomach spicy hot food, make sure you tell the waiter. We enjoyed a leisurely lunch here after a walk in the park

This veritable heritage building brings some nostalgia to the oldies who have frequented this "house" in their heyday. The new generation should find this spot a perfect setting too for an outing, a get-together or even for dates! Tucked in a remote corner of the island up north with the restaurant facing the sea and the neighboring country, and taking a leisurely walk through the verdant Sembawang Park, it is no wonder I never tire visiting the Beaulieu House! Travelling to Sembawang Park quickly melts away your stress levels as you pass through a countrtside of greenery, giving one a sense of going on a short break away from the hustle and bustle of city life! And what about the cuisine? Well, both Western and Chinese cuisine is served, and there is certainly a wide variety on the menu to choose from for your many frequent visits. Quality of food is excellent and price is reasonable. Service is also very good. What more can we ask for - a perfect spot for a quick relaxing break from the city and for good food to accompany your relaxation! Highly recommended

Last week, my family members visited beaulieu house restaurant at sembawang park. The restaurant is housed in a colonial bungalow and oversees the open sea at the park. We had a variety of seafood and western food. Our orders were a hongkong steam fish,beancurd,kailan,prawns,lamb chop, chicken wings,mee goring and fried rice. We ordered more than what we can eat and managed to finish most items. It is a nice place to dine for lunch or dinner. Some dishes were average while the lamb chop was the food of the day. Pricing was a little high although they gave a discount of 10%.Anice place to dine. The boss Richard and a staff Steven were very pleasant and helpful
