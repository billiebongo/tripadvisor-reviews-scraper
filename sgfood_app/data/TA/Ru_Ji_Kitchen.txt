Great tasting, cheap comfort food that is worth a try or two! Fishballs and fishcakes are handmade by the boss. Go for it!

We ordered both the dried noodles and the soup version. Both tasted good and the home made fish balls were especially good. And it cost only SGD3 each. Good value. There was a slight queue but it moved pretty quickly.

If I were to bring a foreign friend to try Singapore dried noodles, this is definitely the place!The fishballs and fishcakes are all handmade. Very bouncy and fresh. Love the chilli paste that goes with the noodles. The taste really reminded me of the authentic mee pok that I ate when I was a small kid.I will strongly recommend to order $4 as you will get more fishballs. Expect to see long queue especially during breakfast and lunch time

Stopped off here for lunch today for a break whilst hiking along the old Malaya railway line. This place was recommended by my friend and even though there was quite a long line we still decided to wait it out to try the noodles. We both opted for the meepok fishball noodles (dry) and were very impressed with the result. Well worth a visit

As it was a weekday, I chanced a short queue at this stall and I quickly seized the opportunity to get my food.I ordered the dry Mee Pok (Thin yellow noodles) with chilli. It came with a bowl of soup with 3 fishballs and several slices of fish cake.The noodles were al dente and was tasty with the chilli, fried shallots and pork lard. The fish balls are slightly bigger than normal and irregularly shaped, indiating that they are made by hand and not machine-made. The fishballs had a good bite to it and were not bad.The owner was also invited to suport Singapore Day overseas, where a big carnival is held overseas in a big city like London/ Melbourne to allow overseas Singaporeans to come together, network and celebrate their Singapore roots. at the carnival, skits and food are provided, allowing Singaporeans living overseas to reminise the food from Singapore that they miss eating. They also have a stall at Redhill Hawker Centre that is run by the stall owners daughter and son-in-law.Try it
