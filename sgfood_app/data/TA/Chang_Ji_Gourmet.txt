I have eaten from this stall quite a few times over the last few years. The menu is simple and consist of 3 choices; fried bee hoon, fried noodles and peanut porridge, currently at $1 each, and is helmed by elderly folks. If you observe its customersâ€™ profile, most will buy a bowl of peanut porridge and a plate of fried bee hoon. Some customers would buy one of the dishes to supplement whatever they have bought elsewhere. The food is definitely no-frills but nonetheless tasty and Is well worth a visit if you are in this area. The only problem is that the stall may not be consistent in being operated at all times.

It's rare to find such stalls nowadays selling such good & simple no frills 'limited' food.Only 3 items are sold here & they are all humble food. No fancy dishes, no colourful side toppings/additions, no expensive ingredients. What you see is what you get. All items are sold at one standard price of $1 per serving.Simple food it may be, or it may looked unappetising to a first time visitor but it's good. Testimony to this is the long regular queues which I see each time I am here.Sometimes life's real pleasures comes in the simplest form. And not necessarily has to be expensive too.
