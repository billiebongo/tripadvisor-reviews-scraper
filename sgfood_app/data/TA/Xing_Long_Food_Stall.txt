This is a zhi char store that specialise in Steam Song Fishhead. They own two stalls (#02-134 & #02-161) and closed every Wed. There are actually many stores selling similar fishheads in Hong Kong Style in this hawker centre but I personally love the local style with crisp fried pork lard cubes, fermented soya beans and chilli. It goes very well with steam rice. Get a group of friends and you can order steamed fishhead, prawn paste chicken, oyster omelette, coffee pork ribs, kangkong with cuttlefish and simple veg. Price is reasonable
