We ordered gobi manchurian for starters. It was awesome! The main course we ordered was paneer and it was tasty too. The price is slightly high but a must try for Indian food lovers.

Best Indian I’ve had in a very long time I must congratulate the staff so nice and helpful they even put our wedding first song on for us, I would really strongly recommend this place to anyone visiting Singapore
5
We visited the restaurant next to Lau Pa Sat. Butter chicken and garlic naan are a must. Both food and service are great
5
if you visiting Little India and your taste buds are craving for indian food then you should not miss this place. great food.. friendly staff
5
Always make a stop here during my Singapore visits.
Excellent freshly cooked curries and dishes full of flavour. Highly recommend Dhaba fish curry and chicken tikka two ways but so far not gone wrong with any dishes I ordered.
5
The ambience is set on a modern concept and didn't expect the food to be so good. The portions are massive and I will definitely recommend the Buriyani.
5
If you’d like to try an authentic North Indian place don’t miss urban roti. The place has a fab mix of veg and non veg food options. You could try the mutton Biryani, it’s yum! Also check out pindi chole (chickpeas), or the Rajasthani Laal Maas (mutton gravy). Wash it with a chilled beer! High on cleanliness and good ambience. They can improve the music but it’s ok to live with!

Having seen so many good reviews my expectations were high. I have eaten a lot of Indian food and even been on Indian cooking courses, so maybe I am a bit more particular that the average diner. I found the consistency of the palak paneer greasy and slimy and the duo curry very confused in flavour. The special gulab jaman was ok, but lacked the firm texture that really good jaman has
4
We found this restaurant as we were coming out of Mustafa Centre.The ambience was nice and the samosas lovely. The meal was excellent, but the thing that annoyed me was the $15 for a beer.Way over the top. Apart from that I would go back
1
We went to Urban Roti as we had heard that the food is good. We ordered set meals for 2 of us, the Rice and Vegetable was served immediately. But the Naan/Roti was not served till 20 mins. We tried checking with 2-3 Staff but all ignored .I had to raise my voice and later the Naan was served in 2 mins.Please be patient if you need to go to Urban Roti and dont expect quick service
3
Food tastes great. But the attitude of some staffs rotten. The person who standing near the entrance supposed to welcome is prejudging the guest that they don’t spend and treating without happiness as per his judgment.
4
Good good - but all their vegetarian Thali always has paneer - they could do with a bit more variety for vegetarians. But very good food
5
Conveniently located across from Mostafa Department store, this brightly decorated restaurant won’t disappoint. The food was hot, flavorful and efficiently served.
4
Terribly nice food probably the best Indian meal you,ll have. Takes a little while to get the meal, $55 for a soup entree, biryani and a meal, you can get a lot cheaper.....but?
5
Very nice ambient (open for only 4 months), really tasty and delicious food that is much different from the others!
5
From a palette, bored by UK Indian food, this was an eye opener. Shockingly good chicken tikka/tandoori, simply first class curries (try the chicken kadai - superb).Perfectly sized portions (nothing worse than a lorry-load of food arriving ; equally, never good to still feel hungry...), fairly priced drinks (by Singapore standards), good, instantly available but not creepily overattentive, service.A simply outstanding culinary experience - MANY THANKS 
4
Enjoyed the duo chicken curry with came with spinach and pistachio sprinkled on top of the dish. The bbq curried salmon was our first time and it was moist inside each cube of salmon and wasn't fishy at all . The black lentils was great too. And all that went so well with the Dunkel and the garlic naan.
5
I have had Biryani in about 5-6 places since I moved to Singapore and have to say Urban Roti undoubtedly serves the best Dum Biryani in town. The flavor, aroma, the spices..it was simply mouth watering and left me craving for more after I had finished my meal.Will definitely be visiting again. Chicken biryani costs $16 and Mutton Dum Biryani $18. Slightly on the higher side but I think its definitely worth it. Will recommend the mutton biryani to anyone who wants to try it
5
My wife and I visited Urban Roti's Syed Alwi Road branch near Mustafa for our lunch (bang opposite Entrance 2) and came away extremely satisfied with our meal. We heard from the staff who were very friendly, that the restaurant was only opened recently so the place looked very new, clean and nicely decorated with modern interior. The place also had a nostalgic feeling reminiscent of India with animated images of auto-rickshaws, mumbai double decker buses, Indian tea kettle, tabla, sitar and a tiffin carrier. On the inside you can see actual rolling pins hung on the wall to create a feeling of being in India or in an environment that serves guests with authentic nan and rotis.We ordered from the set-lunch menu - one chicken biryani and Rogan Josh (Mutton Curry) with Nan that came with chilled lime juice. Both dishes tickled your taste buds that was spicy and highly satisfying, while the chilled lime juice was very refreshing. My wife and I really liked the ambience with comfortable seating and we shall certainly come back here to try other dishes that includes Punjabi, South Indian, Bengali or recommend the place to our friends and family as it has been very satisfying. I'd give it an overall rating of 9.2 out 10 (taste, choices, decor, cleanliness and service)Is it Halal ??According to the staff, the meat served is "Halal" and since they were serving hard drinks (liquor), they could not obtain certification
4
Contrary to my visit to their lau pa sat outlet,my experience at their syed alwi road outlet was very pleasant.their new outlet here is beautifully decorated and the menu here is very interesting. Being a vegetarian the options become limited,but nevertheless they are quite delightful as well.especially their Sab'z bharta masala is worth a try.this place has become mine and my family's new favourite food destination in this area
5
I tried the veg and non veg food both at the little India branch and the food was awesome. The service was good and was reasonable for the taste and service i got. Recommend for good food.
5
The food at Urban Roti - Little India, is one of our favorite Indian restaurant now in Singapore.
The curries are different not the typical ones. Quality and service very good.
Very much recommended.
5
We visited Urban Roti in front to Mustafa in Singapore for lunch. The food was excellent and service good. It was the best Indian food I had in Singapore.
Try their biryani, you will love it!
5
Only a few hours here and needed to stretch my legs after checking in. This place just a few yards away by the Satay Market and serves really very tasty food. Here for 3 weeks so will likely return

@TheKuoKnowsThis restaurant certainly knows how to treat customers like royalty. Nothing was too much trouble.The Non-Vegetarian Tasting Platter was a veritable feast. It had a bit of everything - Tandoori Prawns, Grilled Fish, Chicken, Kebabs and more. There was even something left over to take home.The platter served as both a starter and a main course. So for something with a bit of sauce, the restaurant put together an Aloo Gobi... with potatoes thrown in for good measure. Heaven!Urban Roti gets full marks from me. There are two outlets, one in Lau Pa Sat and the other in Little India. Tried one and what better excuse does one need to try the other

We had visited this place last year. It is located in Lou Pa Sat ,right in the middle , surrounded by hundreds of offices and commercial establishments . These offices have lunch break between 12 noon and 2 PM.Yesterday went there againThe place has not changed at all. The ambiance is same.The decor is same. Even the sitting arrangements are same. No change at all . Only change is that in menu,Veg,NonVeg and Byrani,"Set Thali "was on offer for . Non Veg Thali consists Roti /Nan,Rice,1veg,papad,chicken /mutton ,a soft drink and a starter . Byrani Thali had chicken /mutton byrani ,starter,soft drink and Raita,papad.Yesterday went there ,around 12 noon. Soon the place was jam packed,with waiting outside . The staff was all business. Service was super fast to achieve as much turnover as possible within 2 hours of lunch break.The Non Veg as Byrani Thali were sufficient to satisfy the hunger of a normal person. The taste and quality of food was sufficient to satisfy a gourmet. The food was really very good .Worth another visit

The place has to be booked in advance. Gets a big lunch hour rush. But the waiters start cleaning away your plate even before you finish the food during the lunch hours. Understand that they expect rush, but should they not be prepared? If you are paying for the services, you cannot expect waiters rounding your table every now and then to take your plate away, just to make seat for another customer. Inthe end we didn't even finish the ordered food and they took them away
4
I visited the place with my family. We had bee there in Singapore since 5 days but getting vegetarian food may be a bit frustrating if you are outside little India. This place is in the central business district and quite approachable. The food was amazing. Authentic Indian taste. We had Dal Bukhara and Paneer Tikka masala which were upto our expectations. The service was good. The restaurant is a bit expensive a heavy on the pocket than the regular ones.
3
We visited the newly opened outlet just opposite Mustafa center. They had one of the best menu in town and the food was good in taste. However, what was upsetting was the way they never allowed us to move in to inside tables.We were 3 people who entered the restaurant at 11 pm on a Friday night. Since the restaurant was fully occupied, we were made to occupy the outer most table- well understood. Bt soon after, people started leaving the restaurant and the tables inside were empty but even after requesting the management to move us in, they did not care to make the arrangements n just did not allow us to move in. Since we were very hungry, we just waited to finish the food n leave. The last order is at 11:30 pm so please make sure you reach before that. Just wish the management paid more attention to hospitality..

We had been to this place for a business lunch and ordered there set lunch meal.The food was average and did not meet the expectations. The price is pretty high. Serving food on a good crockery doesnt make the food good! Service was ok. They need to improve a lot more and price the food well, before people stop coming to the place, as many of us never thought of going even once ever.
4
Amazing value set lunch for $12. Quality food reasonably priced. The restaurant is jam packed but has a high turnover.
The veg meal included paneer and dal whilst the non veg meal had an excellent meat curry.
Recommended for a no frills quick lunch.
5
Great Indian food! I would definitely eat there again. Food was fresh and plenty of it. We took it away and had it again the next night too.
4
Little India is fast becoming one of my favourite areas in Singapore. A real energy among the streets - its a little bit like being in the real deal. The food at Urban Roti was fantastic and while I would have been happy with the vegetarian lot, they insisted I try the "red meat" dish and I am pleased I did - rich snd spicy with the lamb meat tender as. The fave though was actually the paneer in spicy gravy. Service was pleasant and attentive. The House Pour wine is the good value option.

Just asked for an explanation of one of the items on the menu card. Under Delicacies of Punjab>Dal Tadkewali> Masur Dal Cooked in Authentic Hyderabadi Style. When asked to explain about this dish the manager Mr. Mani was horribly arrogant. The service team is full of arrogant men. If the Dish is cooked Hyderabadi Style it is not Punjabi anyway and Masur Dal as Dal Tadka, authentic Indian food died a million death. Not for connoisseurs
3
Been here twice. It's odd to say this m, but the food is Good, just tooooooooo salty. Both times, the food was over salted but the underlying flavour, texture and consistency of their curries is amazing. Staff are not the most engaging, and seem a bit scattered, but the food is good and doesn't take to long, even when their busy. It's a great lunch time venue with colleagues!
5
Restaurant located in a business district, spacious and good ambiance. Ordered chilly paneer, chicken tikka alongwith sweet lassi and salty lassi for starters. All good, chilly paneer and sweet lassi were out standing. Had ma ki daal, paneer tikka masala, veg lucknavi alongwith lachha paratha, naan, Roomali roti and chicken biryani. All very tasty and well cooked. Ma ki dal was outstanding
5
This Indian eat house discretely nestled at the back of Lau Pa Sat is teeming with a creative Indian Menu. when you are finished with endless evenings eating satay at the famous street stalls go upmarket a little and try Urban Roti, they seem to infuse great flavours in their food, the Dahl soup and Biriyanis are superb, give it a go you will be glad you did, happy hour beers too
4
The butter chicken is to die for! I am an Indian and have tasted Indian food across the city and have been more disappointed than content with the restos. So visiting Urban Roti was a relief and pleasure. The garlic Naan and Butter Chicken combo is awesome. It tastes just like home. Food is fresh and the mango lassi is a must have as well. It is a good lunch and dinner place. I have brought many non Indian friends and colleagues to this place and they all equally love the food here. It is not a huge resto so it can get crowded. But the food will any day drag me there
5
I have been to this place many times and it never disappoints me. Truly consistent in quality of food until now.+1) Freshly cooked, tasty and delicious food2) Authentic taste3) reasonably priced and during lunch hours set meals are value for money4) Good services and they have started home delivery too which is one more plus point -1) nothing much, perhaps lower level staff could be trained further so that service also stays notch. It's not certainly bad currently but they do have potentials to improve this
4
Loving it!Pakoda or the closest thing you can get to an Onion Bhaji in Singapore.Chicken Tikka and Chicken Tikka masala using boneless meat. Rogan Josh, the meat is so tender! They have loads of interesting dishes, it's nice and clean. I really want to go here with a Xu Eid and fully explore the menu!I recommended it to the British guys in the office and they loved it to! So if you want a British style Indian curry but don't mind exploring new stuff as well try it
3
The food was good.typical Indian Punjabi food. The portions were a little small though. Can have a more creative chat /starter menu.
5
Been here several times for lunch. Always take the lunch set and never been disappointed by it. Good portion and great taste. Friendly service.
5
this is one of best Indian restaurant in Singapore ,they serve fixed lunch ,excellent with one roti/nan.one veg ,dal ,Rice & curd ,in this Singapore they serve very good butter milk

I went here for a lunch after a strong recommendation from a friend. This place was teeming with people @ 12 noon. After a short wait we got a table, so here is the experience:Ambiance: One of the better Indian restaurants and definitely much more contemporary than the entire lot of Indian restaurants in little India. This is a place where you can host a business meal as well as take family out for a fine dine.Food: While they were running a combo on biryani and I saw a biryani almost in each table. Prompting me to order for one...my take, the basmati was good but it's not an authentic lucknowi or hydrabadi biryani. However, the combo is great value for money. I had ordered for a wheat beer and a galoti kabeb, the kabeb was spot on. Melting in your mouth. Disappointed by the quantity, mini sized kabebs. Butter milk/chaach - This was tremendously good. As authentic as it can get. Service: Now this place was packed with a sizeable crowd waiting for tables as well. Despite the mad rush, I think they did a fair job of being attentive. We were sitting outside, I did not have to frustrate myself to get some service. Though I had to walk up to the cashier to ask for a bill and settle it, since I could not get anyone's attention to get us the cheque. Overall: I would come back again. This is a modern Indian restaurant, with Indian chefs in the kitchen. Thank god they did not put Taj Mahal and Bollywood posters to make it look "Indian"

Been there for Dinner , appetizers a bit on the creative side and a bit confusing (deconstructed Samosa in a broth with Yogourt , Tamarind and Chick Peas) , but the Rice and the Main Dish (Dhaba Fish Curry) were outstanding - amongst the best Indian dishes I ever had and I have been in a lot of places 
4
One can easily be confused as to whether this is a proper restaurant or a Lau Pa Sat stall with its own seating. Well, it is the former, with friendly service and very good North Indian food. The set lunch is great value, but do order a la carte - you'd be surprised how the food even surpasses that at many established eateries in town. Seating can be cramped, and the ambience is not exactly elegant (nor is the name by the way - Urban Roti???), so not a place to impress your romantic target on Valentine's day
5
A very conveniently located (on the corner of the famouse Lau Pa Sat food court), walkable distance from CBD.Food choces are very different, though only North Indian.The decor is amazingly refreshing and one can walk back the memory lane (with historical indian post cards on display).Staff is generally very supportive, but during week ends / when bigger groups around, service takes time

Had heard raving reviews and was very excited about finally being able to make it . Loved the ambience , very hip . Staff was ok , not pushy , not smiling either , which is alright. There were lots of people who looked like they were managing the place and on Friday eve to find them all chatting with one another , constantly , was a surprise . Loud jokes , laughter .. a bit of a put off . But cannot fault the service . Gave everything that we asked for . Now for the food . We wanted to try all the starters , given that we are true blue Indians and salivating at the description ! So long story short , decided to order a platter which was for a whopping 32 sgd . We thought an entire platter with 2 naans ( 7.50 sgd ) will be enough for the two of us , ordered a chicken Biryani ( 16 sgd )just to be on the safe side . The platter had a total of 12 bite sized pieces . 3 squirmy shrimps laden with butter and Lemon , 3 one inch squares of a delectable fish , 3 green coloured dry and insipid chicken tikka , 3 pieces of mutton kebabs that we had to leave because they tasted off . The garlic naan was hot and yummy . Turned a bit rubbery over time . The saving grace was the chicken biryani , Good portion size , lots of meat , fragrant , spicy ,and rich . Raita was lovely , not the usual watered down version served at restaurants . Dinner for 2 with the above mentioned 3 dishes came to 67.50 sgd . Will return only if I am in the mood for some biryani . Please UP your tikkas /tandoori items on the menu .

Came to meet a few friends for lunch and arrived later, as my other 3 friends were half done with their lunch. Management, in a rush to get new customers, was asking me to move to a single, separate table. When a table for 4 opened up and I asked we were moved to that one, he said "your friends are almost finished". So I just cancelled my dish and went out.Few minutes later, outside, another waiter comes and asks that I had ordered a dish. I told him I cancelled since his manager couldn't move us, he just turned his back and went away. I can honestly say that so far, it's the worst service I've ever had in a restaurant in Singapore
4
Urban Roti is very conveniently located in the CBD and is a nice place for a relaxed weekday dinner. Their menu is standard (the menu card though is done up very well), we ordered a la carte: Palak Paneer, Egg Curry, Garlic Naan, & Egg Biryani. The portions are generous and the flavour fairly authentic. They could definitely go easy on the oil but overall, we had a good meal
4
At last some good Indian Food that suits your palate. The food was as per the need. Had North Indian food and was very good.
5
This is my go to place currently for any colleagues wanting to try good Indian food for lunch. Their lunch set menu is fantastic value for money and the service is always great. The staff here take the pains to recognize and greet regular customers.
4
Urban Roti offers delicious North Indian food. Have tried the lunch and dinner and would definitely recommend.
4
Great place for lunch, for 12++ you get a good meal. Tastes great. Tried the a la carte once but then the deal is not as interesting.
1
Food is good but not worth the terrible service. Long wait times, rude staff, forgotten orders, the only thing that came promptly was the bill.
4
There is no other good Indian restaurants near Robinson road. Ideal for the Indians staying at Sofitel So Hotel, just opposite to hotel. Ordered kadhai Panneer and butter nan, taste was good.
4
This place was empty on Saturday night at about 7pm when we arrived. We had read good reviews and we were very glad we were swayed by them to give it a try! The food was some of the best Indian food that we have tried. The samosa chat to start was superb. Meat was good quality and the flavours fantastic. The service could have been a bit better - took a long time to take our order despite us being the only ones there. Don't let it put you off, the food is worth it
4
Lau Pa Sat Festival Market is a major foodi land mark in Rebuilt Victorian covered hawker center. There are literally hundreds of food stalls offering local delicacies & international food . Amidts all these stalls is a restaurant " Urban Roti " .It offers Indian cuisine . Due to its location even though a restaurant, you get a "stall " feeling.Food is good but service is poor . Takes lot of time for food to be served , even the bill took far to long to be brought 
4
Went in evening for drinks and snacks and surprisingly very good. Service is prompt and friendly and they are ready to customize the dishes as per your need.We had a tower of ledger beer, Non-veg Tandoori platter and some chat items. Dishes were good and tested fresh.Overall very good
5
On entering this establishment, we were immediately greeted by the hospitable team member who showed us to our choice of seats. It was a weekday night and the restaurant had a respectable crowd. Its modern decor is made more interesting with everyday objects such as bundled envelopes and pins stuck up on the walls. The tables were spread out so the restaurant did not look so cramped.The restaurant serves authentic Indian cuisine and we decided on our usual purÃ©ed spinach with cottage cheese, rice, naan and our firm favourite, butter chicken. If ever one tires of satay, this is a definite must-try
