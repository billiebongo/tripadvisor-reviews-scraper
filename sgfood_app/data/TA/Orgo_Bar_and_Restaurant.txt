we had one glass of the red housewine which was recommended to us and we all felt sick the day after. Either the wine was old or just not good at all. will never come back.

Different view of the Bay with a good cocktail list but more limited menu that could use some sprucing up. Some seating indoors and some outside. Lighting dark for views but a bit tough for seeing the food. Service spotty in two visits there.

This has become one of my favourite bars in Singapore. Great views at night and thoughtful service staff. Makes a great place for chatting.
3
Personally, I like this place for it's location and view. I have been visiting this place after office drinks. Last time, I visited this place for dinner/drinks with friends. Honestly, dinner was disappointing. Very limited options and food portion was tiny compared to their price. Not recommended for food

~I'd called ahead for a reservation 6pm Sat but it wasn't crowded at this time. they called me to ask if it was for drinks or dinner and acknowledged they'd setup for drinks ~enter the Esplanade from the Annexe side taxi stand opposite Marina Square (Rolex) / Mandarin Oriental~take the first lift on the right up to Orgo on the 4th storey but upon exiting there are no signs so walk straight ahead left up the steps to PIP's Playground when u exit on the rooftop make a leff and walk 20m you will see Orgo on your left ~once I looked at the entirely open air restaurant it was a small let down (wanted some air conditioning) but that's all me in this hot & humid outdoors ~shown to our seats overlooking the beautiful bay oops that seat sank so far down I could barely look over the ledge!!!sry i left before ordering anythin

Some amazing view especially at sunset when the city changes so quickly. Drinks are ok and service while friendly is quite slow. In particular we waited an age for our sharing appetiser plate. When the plate came it was tasty but very small and not really enough to share. The T-Bone platter sharing dish for main was a better size and ok but nothing to write home about. So definitely worth it for a drink at sunset but eat somewhere else once dark.
4
We had a beautiful evening with a family of four, enjoying a few drinks and the view. However, the food is severely overpriced and just serves as an appetizer to have more drinks. Many other rooftop bars are difficult to get in without reservation. So, if you are looking for a nice rooftop bar to relax after a long day, have a drink and enjoy the view and the open air music in front of Esplanade, then stop by and give it a try. It served us much better than its tripadvisor rating suggested

We made a reservation to have dinner here so an out-of-town guest could see the NDP rehearsals. We should have just gone up and watched for free as this place was terrible. The service was painfully slow and unfriendly. It took nearly 15 minutes to get 2 draft beers! The restaurant itself is pretty shabby (especially considering the prices!). The food was way overpriced for the quality and quantity. We ordered the antipasto platter which was supposed to be for 2 or more people and were surprised to see that it only had a few slices of meat, 1 tiny blob of cheese and a small bowl of olives that tasted like they came from a grocery store can. We ended up ordering a handful more starters as we were all hungry and the portions were REALLY small. None were particularly good. We ended up leaving before the fireworks as we got tired of waiting for drinks to be served and were all still hungry after a nearly $300 bill! We went home and made dinner ourselves. Total waste of time and money
1
Great view great opportunity but tired and worn out furniture fixtures and food - expensive rubbish. The only good thing on the menu (the menu itself was a shock with dirty hardboard covers held together by twine) was the sparkling water - lamb with black salt sounded good but it was desperately far from good - tasteless over cooked cutlets, limp oily cold red pepper, tasteless pumpkin purÃ©e, and vinegary red onion amount to a dish I really I wish to forget. My partners pasta could have been better cooked by my 14 yr old daughter - Orgo please stop resting on your great location and wake up - there are so many better food offerings within a stones throw of here. Time for a refresh for sure. Not worth a visit
4
Although a long way from the nearest MRT (a long way...!) the view from the roof at Theatres by the Bay is great, taking in Marina Bay Sands, the Fullerton, city skyline and around to the Durian.We had decent cocktails (the Orgo take on Singapore Slings and a Bloody Mary). My wife also had a non-alcoholic lychee martini that turned out to be lychee juice - a bit disappointing. The serving of paella was enough for a light meal for 3, a bit crisp at the edges but pretty tasty.Come for the view at sunset - it's a different but very pleasant place to visit
5
We went here for an anniversary dinner and had a wonderful time. We really enjoyed our martinis and food and the views were incredible. Very cozy atmosphere giving you a great view of the Singapore skyline. Would highly recommend!
4
Perfect for couples. Highly recommended for the view and drinks .The service is good too but the food is just about average .
4
The bar is not only funky with a mixologist bar tender, it has the most incredible views over the city. The view to Marina Bay Sands is stunning and back to The Fullerton is just as grand.
4
Pleasantly surprised with the staff. They were told it's my birthday and they surprised me by having a pastry nicely played for me, free of charge
Of course the views are amazing and a nice place to spend an evening with your spouse
2
Was there for my 21st Birthday. Wasn't very impressed. Food was below average but I have to agree that we do have a perfect view. Limited food choices on menu. Extensive drinks menu. Expected much more.
Would not go back again.
4
I suggest making a reservation at around 6.45 to 7pm. Though sunset is on the other side of the esplanade building, the view is still stunning nonetheless. Would have given 5 stars if not for the small portion. The small portion was almost reflective of fine dining... which I assumed Orgo was not. Good to chill, hang out. Management also gave a complementary slice of birthday cake and sang a birthday song. Appreciate it a lot
4
Visited with some friends in January for a couple of drinks. Had the most delicious cocktails and the view was amazing. The place has a classy but relaxed atmosphere and it was a perfect place to chill with friends. I will go back next time I visit Singapore for sure
4
Even though it's on the top floor of the 'Esplanade' theatre building, this place is still quite intimate.We came to 'Orgo' for a drink to watch the Singapore skyline light up as dusk fell.There is an extensive drinks list and the cocktails here are really nice. The only drawback is that the view from wherever you sit is a little hampered by a building in the foreground. This means whilst you can see the 'Fullerton' and merlion fairly well, it is not a great spot to see the 'Marina Bay Sands' side of the harbour.The service and ambience were both to a high standard, however
1
Horrendous experience overall..First time here..no doubt great view, but nothing more...Food taste awful (especially the meatballs) and honestly...felt it was way too overpriced .. Service was terrible and staffs were inattentive..For big group - dining table in the room might need to be shared with others, unless you spend over $100 per person to get the whole room by yourselves..sorry..but definitely not coming back .
5
Good VIew, nice Drinks, nice selection of music and good atmosphere.Selection of drinks and Foods is quite good for the bar + have good humidor with some Cigar Brands.If you seek 1-2 hours of relaxation with the best in town view and atmosphere - this should be your choice
2
Nice view and really friendly service. That s all. The coktails are pricey without flavour...except the bill. More icecubes than alcohol...other alternative i think
4
My partner found this bar and it was great. Perfect selection of beverages and although we didn't try the food, it sounded delicious. Highly recommend to drop by and have a drink or two.

Last night my family dined at Orgo before attending the opera. We were seated outside which normally would be welcomed at a place with such beautiful views of the CBD area but yesterday was the first day that the haze was over 200. So not such a nice place to be seated. Our daughters ordered three appetizers to share as they were not terribly hungry and my husband and I each ordered a main. The table/chair combo would be great for cocktails and nibbles but the chair was very low and deep (it needed a pillow for the back) so difficult for dinner. The rooftop had metal plates which were covered with an "astroturf" for lack of a better word. Every time someone stepped on the metal plate that part of my chair was on my chair moved which I found very disconcerting, a bit like having someone kick your seat on an airplane. I got over it but it was an annoyance. The appetizers were tapas and beautifully presented. The hummus needed a few more of the flat crisps to eat it with and the staff brought more promptly after we asked. The bruschetta was served on stale small breads and didn't win anyone over. The meatballs were, well, only two for $12 and the worst value on the menu! Honestly, a $6 meatball??? Ridiculous. It has a garlic toast on the side, made with the same stale bread from bruschetta. We saw others order the paella which was well sized and looked wonderful. My husband had the cod curry which was lovely but smallish for $40. I had the lamb which the server did not ask how I wanted cooked (it came perfectly cooked, medium rare) and was very tasty. After we called for the check, the waiter asked to see our tickets for the opera as they offer a 10% discount for dinner if you are attending an event in the Esplanade (I had noted this in my reservation request). It was such a pleasant surprise to have them offer the discount. Overall, I think that we ordered poorly. This place is great for a drink with a view, more relaxed than other spots in the area. Choose wisely from the manu and ask to be seated inside if you want dinner. They have some glassed in tables which looked lovely
1
I had pre-conncert dinner here. The patter on the website about the passion the Italian chef had for food made me want to try.The food was over-priced : two tiny meatballs for 12 SGD! . They tasted terrible and texture was starchy and tough.The hummus carasau was the worst (it was also spelled incorrectly as carrasu on the menu) . The carasau had been deep fried as confirmed by the chef when we complained. Carasau is a thin type of Italian bread that should be baked in the oven. Complaints were not dealt with gracefully and nothing taken off the bill ."Different people have different preferences " was what the waiter replied with.Then we were double charged for each item we had ordered and had to call the credit card company

My wife and I were planning to eat at an interesting restaurant adjacent to the Esplanade Mall, but it was too crowded. We found a Trip Advisor- recommended restaurant nearby but decided not to spend $100 p/p for a fixed menu dinner, as we wanted lighter fare. We happened on Orgo on the roof of the Esplanade Mall and found the setting fantastic! Unfortunately the calamari and shrimp appetizer was very salty, and the smoked salmon salad only so-so. As spur-of-the-moment choices go, it was very romantic. Would we choose it again? Not so sure, but different food choices may have been better. No better roof-top setting for a late-nite dinner or drinks, however
5
I love my martini and rather picky when trying any. Orgo bar provides a good choices of Martini! Many unusual flavours like Banana, Dragonfruit, Soursop and many more! It is $20 per glass, but it's quality drink and great ambience for photos and romance!Sadly, the food menu is alittle limited, especially finger food, and most of the dishes are expensive. But no doubt, it must be good as there were many customers who ordered food. The bar people are very professional and easy to catch. I was asked by three different people if I would like a drink even though I was waiting for it. Overall I would definitely return for more Martini
5
Orgo is an exceptional bar & restaurant located on top of the Durian building. Cocktails are very good, prepared with fresh and organic fruits. The atmosphere is very nice. The design of the bar is unique. This place is really recommended to spend a great time with friends or with your famil
4
Right at the roof top of Esplanade, Orgo is a nice al fresco bar with a gorgeous view. The food menu is quite limited but decent enough for the drinks. They have a wide menu of beer coolers, cocktails and some nice wine too. We tried a soursop beer cooler $18 and a cherry cocktail $25. Both were delicious
5
A week before my dinner, we went to Orgo at noon to 'scout' for a venue. It was HOT HOT HOT! We were afraid that our Taiwanese guests would mind dining in the alfresco area. But I called Adeline and she reassured me that all will be taken care of.On Saturday, we had an 8pm show Les Miserables. I arrived at 6.20pm to ensure all was well! YES! Aircon'd sheltered glass cubicles with 2 sliding glass doors! Great settings.When my guests arrived, they WOWed non-stop. I followed the male supervisor his shortlisted menu with starters & main course on sharing/tasting-basis. His recommendation was perfect. Service was good. The scene was fantastic, from sunset to darkened skies, beautiful lights from all around us. Guests snapped photos all the time. They loved the seafood baked rice, esp the Cod in green curry, they were yummy.We had a 10% discount. No need to rush to the theatre, we had ample time! Thank you Orgo
5
Orgo offered a 10 percent discount for theater ticket holders. My friend I dined there after seeing Les Miserables in the Esplanade theaters that is in the same building. It's on the roof and offers a superb view of Singapore's city skyline. They have a great selection of Southeast-Asian inspired mocktails. I enjoyed one with dragon fruit in it. I had the lamb and it was tasty
5
Great view, excellent food and a wide array of cocktails. I had the Pamelo & Basil cocktail and at the first sip there was a burst of flavours which married beautifully with the city skyline of Singapore. Wonderful place will certainly visit again.
4
Kinda gave me the feeling of being in HK, Kowloon side at TST seeing the light show. Nice place to take pictures. Drinks were quite nice too.
5
Very highly recommended. Singapore sling cocktail was the best. No other place can beat the view, drinks and the food that this place has to offer.
5
We where there in an afternoon. Sat down and enjoyed the great view of Singapore.
Very friendly and professional service.
Great drinks and delicious snacks.
4
We had drinks here and had the bar almost to ourselves. Nice views over the bay. Good drinks. We just found it a bit too dark there. A bit more light would have improved the ambiance, we thought.
5
Went there to celebrate my friend birthday. The ambiance was very nice. It had a very good night view. Food was good. The restaurant offer us a free slice of cake as it was my friend birthday. The staff is very friendly and attentive. Well done. Thank you very much. It was overall a nice feel
2
Sadly, and regretfully - I wish I have more positive things to say. This is an update of my earlier positive review of Orgo. The views are unchanged but the quality of the service and drinks are now patchy. Since the last review I have been back to Orgo 3 times and each time some drinks were so-so and some were just dismal. I've now stopped recommending Orgo for its unique cocktails. It has become really pedestrian and sometimes you even wonder if they measure out the spirit urging eyedroppers. The view is free. So, unless you are hard pushed I would skip the drinks. It is another pedestrian bar. Just don't expect too much and you will be right.
5
Love the view that hostess seated us. We were seated where we can see MBS. The services from the hostess to the waitress is superb. The food is great and the drinks that the waitress recommend us was spot on. The food was great the menu has something to cater for everyone. Love how the chef prepared beef tenderloin and mardarin sobert. Will try the rest of the menu next time when I visite
4
This is a really nice rooftop restaurant with great view of MBS. Went here on a Saturday evening for family dinner (4 persons). The staff were friendly and accommodating as my mum is vegan so they were able to adjust the menu. For appetizer we had the "Tasting Platter" which was a selection of 4 dishes from the starters. For our mains we had the 2 beef tenderloin, 1 paella, 1 house salad and 1 truffle fries (fries to share). The beef were both cooked to perfection, but the paella didn't actually have mush seafood and was quite a large portion. The fries had a good amount of truffle oil on them.Also noticed they have some private rooms for rent which would be good for celebration or corporate dinner
4
We had the chance to have a business dinner at this place. It was licated on the tooftop of esplanade theatres. We had an area reserved for us. Drink variety was great. Food quality was good but we had pre-ordered for the large group. So it was mire of drinks and some snack type items followed by fresh fruit and some cheese cake. But the main quality was the view of the marina. Just amazing
5
Very unique tasty food prepared by the chef. Had some yummy desserts to complement the drinks too! The view is indeed unforgettable and it made the company so much more special and awesome :)
5
Only one comment can be made.... great venue, great staff, sublime food and an incredible chef!
Don't miss it!
5
My friends and I were around Esplanade area after checking out the outdoor free performances and the library.Heard from fellow travellers about Orgo rooftop and its excellent views of MBS and CBD and decided to check it out!It was a refreshing experience with the unique selection of mostly spanish and italian cuisine and fun cocktails and drinks menu.I ordered the selection of cheeses and the gelato ice cream with tacos. For drinks, any of their mojitos are worth trying. We tried about 3 different mixes and thouroughly enjoyed it!For the price I paid for the high quality cheese platter and refreshing yet soothing gelato, I would go back for seconds! Heard that the seafood paella was popular too and will give it a try the next round I am back in Singapore!Pls. Someone should change the music...either its too loud or the genre is just weird..
3
This is the second restaurant i ate in Singapore since arriving from KL with my family. Went to try out ORGO since we are at Esplanade. Great view & Great drink, i have to say the Mojito was really refreshing and tasted pure not like those with heaps of sugar syrup and etc. Food was below average felt that for paella, seafood was not fresh and Rice was rather marshy. Overall considering the experience we had, it is still good enough for me to recommend my friends to come over here at esplanade ORGO for the drink and view
2
Dinner company function - 30 pax.Choice of fish, scallops and tenderloin as mains, smoked salmon and asalad as appetizer.Same consensus by all delegates - fish tasteless, scallops rubbery - probably frozen, tenderloin not tender at all.Alarm bells should have gone off when waiter didn't ask how the beef should be cooked. Dishes arrived in the space of 30 minutes most people were finished with their main when others were still waiting. Service inattentive, music too loud and took several requests to get it turned down. If it was not for the views this rating would be at 1 star. Go for a drink enjoy the scenery but give the food a miss. But be prepared to pay $20++ for a beer
5
Visited the much talked about ORGO on a Friday night with a friend. I ordered the Seafood Pasta and requested for less pasta. Chef Andrea prepared it according to my request. The scallops, prawns, mussels, calamari were nicely seasoned and cooked to perfection. The portion was just right and I thoroughly enjoyed every morsel.Do order some of their wines or champagne to complement the awesome night views of the city skyline. Service was attentive as well and the staff will be more than helpful to take pictures for you! It will be one memorable souvenir!Overall, a once in a lifetime experience and not to be missed! Do remember to make a reservation as it was very crowded esp on weekends
4
I had arranged a reservation some weeks earlier, after being recommended this by a local.A fantastic place to view the light show over the Marina Bay area, coupled with a simple, but thoughtful food and beverage menu. I can highly recommend the beef tenderloin, cooked to order and delicious served with a Kirin Ichiban frozen beer. Service though was a letdown - staff seemed very disinterested at the best of times, and for the prices on offer, I would certainly expect more
2
been there on a corporate dinner. don't know what was paid, but the end result was poor. obviously the $ was not enough or they cannot manage a 15pax party although we were pretty much the only table on a Wednesday night...- watery mojito to begin with.- starters being low grade respins of salads or sliced of bread with some salmon smoked on it.- main dish OK (beef wise) , but served on a cold plate, including it seems the difficulty to manage a table of 15people = cold tenderloin (and do not mention the bland vegetable en papillote).- collapsed dessert = a stack of melting industrial vanilla ice cream with some version of tacos. the waiter got the pile of taco\ice cream all spread across the plate and just handed it over to me with a lame "sorry about that".- diluted expresso.dinner was fun; restaurant was poor
1
TOTALLY DISAPPOINTED with arrangement of the staff in this Restaurant.I was make my booking earlier (few days ago) for dinner before the date. Unfortunately, i was being informed by the staff the date before the night at around 10pm on cancelation of my booking, due to there is private event occupy by other customer on that night.The staff should NOT NOTIFY me on last min, as the said customer was make his booking two days ago. This caused me into troublesome on planning to celebrate with my friend 's birthday!The restaurant should have a list of booking to confirm for reservation, especially for mid-high range of restaurant like ORGO. This is unacceptable to be happened
4
This rooftop bar has great views over the bay ad city including the Marina Bay sands. the drinks menu is good and the food menu is different but there is something for everyone. Go with friends or for a romantic drink. Just for those that worry about these things is there is construction on the fourth floor so the toilets are down on the 2nd floor this can be quite a mission, however it appears this will be finished in November. Worth the view
5
I went there with my friends. The view is amazing! We order few tapas. Quantity are just nice, attentive to detail, nice presentation and really yummy. We plan to stay just for aperitif, instead we spent the all night! Thumbs up for the chef - we really enjoy!! Definitively will be back.
5
In the begining me and my girlfriend was thinking to take a look at the view from the roof top, but the friendly waiter come and approach us to give a try out on their specialties drinks and food. so we went into the bar and sat at a very cosy and quiet corner which really gave us a comfortable feel to enjoying our drinks and food. Price wise is consider reasonable and affordable! will definately visit again with my love ones. is too romantic to be there:
5
On the roof top terrace of the Esplanade theatres there is an awesome place to have drinks and enjoy SingaporeÂ´s silhouette. Go inside the "Durians" and get up. You will find a big terrace with a breathtaking view and a bar with the best Margaritas in Singapore
5
Found out about this place by sheer chance and decided to take our visitor from Australia to check it out. Was not disappointed at all the wine was excellent and the nibbles fresh and tasty. Above all the location was super. Will be going a lot more. Service was good as well. We even left a tip on top of the service charg
2
Service and food was not the best considering its price. This place is popular for its view, I'm guessing (which is nice!). We found hair in our food but management was quick to rectify this by providing complimentary drinks. Not a must visit in Singapore, but a decent-ish option for last minute Sunday dinner with a view
4
This place has a small menu for food so it is more for light bites but the drinks menu is more interesting. Good for a pre or post-performance drink. On the rooftop of the Esplanade theaters, it is a more private area to enjoy the view the waterfront vs. the busy public promenade below
4
The food is average, but it's the setting that draws the clientele (myself included). The choices on the menu are rather small, and rather expensive given the small portions and average quality. But it is a chill "post-dinner" setting with a good selection of spirits and cigars, and as the restaurant is on top of the Esplanade, overlooking the bay. As such, a nice place for a romantic chill night out
3
The service was good, food was ok, drinks were fine, the view from the rooftop was not bad but it could get a little too warm even at night. If you want to have the ultimate rooftop bar experience, i would recommend the MBS sky park
5
the view from Orgo is superb. I've been here many times and would very much like to keep this secret to myself but after hearing friends and relatives being ripped off by unscrupulous vendors for lousy drinks, I've decided to give this place a plug. Let's hope that Orgo will continue to live up to its quality. Firstly, from the top of the Esplanade, you get a beautiful city skyline which includes the Marina Bay Sands. (Personally, I find the other buildings including the Esplanade itself more appealing but the Marina Bay Sands is there - for those who want a good view.) Orgo has intimate seatings but the highlight for me has always been the drinks. The Singapore Sling is very different from the one served in Raffles Hotel. Their business blurb says that they serve seasonal fruit cocktails. The quality of the cocktails unfortunately does vary but it is usually between good and excellent. (to owners of orgo if you are reading this - perhaps you need to work on consistency). However, I've never had a bad cocktail here. I've never been a fan of Singapore Sling but the Singapore Sling in Orgo has changed my mind. Some of my friends have complained that they seem to be abstemious on the proportion of the alcohol for the drinks but hey, I rather have less of a good thing than more of a pipe cleaner. Their house wine is also more drinkable than other places.The tapas are decent. The meals are generally okay though not amazing. Hence I've only been here for drinks and tapas. The dessert can be disappointing so, save the space for a second drink :). The few times we were there, we were served by Ian who was a great host. However, he was not there the last time we visited which was a bit disappointing.If you are in town and looking for a place with a view for drinks - you can't find a better place. If you have guests from out of town, this is definitely a great watering hole
1
The view from Orgo is decent but they simply cannot justify the cost of drinks. 3 pints of lager cost a ridiculous $67SGD (over $50USD!) Over $20 a drink is just madness. And there is no happy hour. These drinks wetre bought at 5pm!! There are other, better rooftop bars in Singapore which are better in terms of value and view. Go to New Asia Bar instead
5
Like others, our party of four spent some time locating this rooftop restaurant and it needs better signage directions. After reading other hit or miss reviews we approached this pre-booked 70th. birthday dinner with a little trepidation. However, our experience was little short of wonderful. The staff were very attentive, came out to greet us and showed us to an air conditioned 4 seat glass observation room. The A.C. was a wee bit severe so at our request the waiter ended up switching it off and sliding open a couple of the glass doors which gave a gentle breeze and perfect temperature. The evening view over the bay was spectacular. The menus and wine arrived as soon as we entered. In between each course the chef arranged a little taster which enhanced the occasion. The food was excellent and the steaks were cooked to perfection.Afterwards we sat out on the terrace and finished off the evening with liquers.This restaurant is expensive but we got what we paid for and it is worth that bit extra for that special occasion
1
From cocktails to the bill, everything was terrible!We ordered mojitos: we had to ask for additional brown sugar, lime and mint! So then we could make the mojitos drinkable...We ordered a seafood paella: it was mostly rice and for the seafood, it was not cooked enough => clams not opened, calamari not eatable, prawns still grey! Worst, they "forgot" to tell me that it was a course for 2 people!My husband ordered beef with mash potatoes:beef was good but side dish not existing! It was enough for us to go away from this place. We asked the bill and shared our feedback with the staff to what they just replied "sorry" and nothing elseSummary: we even didn't eat our dishes for a total bill of 150SGD! Stay away from this place
3
Ambiance - Awesome. Great view. Relatively quiet. It just rained so the temperature was cool. View - great. Service - not as bad as some of the reviews said. They were attentive, friendly and courteous. But could be warmer. It was a busy night. Drinks - seemed limited. But bartender attempted a request for a brandy cocktail (made from a standard menu). They should really not have any smoking section. It was annoying when a table near you have smokersDessert - Banana Foster was good. For ambiance and view, we would go back
2
Wanted to like this place, as its in a great rooftop location surrounded by all the downtown highrises of the Singapore CBD. First problem was the wait staff who was friendly enough but could not speak English at all. Our two drinks arrived separately and I watched the waiter pour out my glass of wine, look at it, sniff the bottle, hesitate, turn to his boss who walked past but didnt notice him and then just brought it over anyway. Not reassuring... However my main issue was the food. The Chef's tasting tapas for $40 was a joke. A single plate with 4 tiny portions, literally a spoonfull each. One was good, two were average and one was not nice. At this point having already spent over $80 we decided to move on and have dinner elsewhere...
4
Orgo is a great stopover in visiting Marina Bay. Is nestled at the Esplanade Theatre rooftop :) At first visit not easy to find this jewel on the 4th floor but wort trying to spend a penny there. The selection of tapas is just ok to pair with drinks which is the main focus of the bar and they are calling it 'crazy scientists project'. Namely, the bar tender expedients with oddly names to great mixes :). Try it
4
Magnificent view!Has 3 dining rooms like a glasshouse for 6 ppl, 14 ppl and 10 ppl. All comes with a minimum spend of $300, $450 & $600.Food was very resonably priced, quality was so-so. Well you get what you pay right?Reserved 3 weeks in advance to catch the NDP fireworks. Overall was great
4
Great location, view and interesting place. I liked it, service, food and drinks all good.I guess a bit expensive but it is upmarket and Singapore......if you wan tcheap this is not it! I didn't have same problems as others........particularly good on jazz nights when Dawn Ho is singing......
3
The thing I like about Orgo is its fabulous location and awesome view. Seated outdoors under the stars with Marina Bay spread out in front of us, the location couldn't be better. Food is rather standard as were the drinks. A bit more creativity would do the trick.For now Jus soak up the ambience it's magical
4
My first time at Orgo, actually wasn't even aware of this place, but when I reached atop the Esplanade was surprised by the concept (glass walled private rooms) and outdoor seating and the views. But that - and the fact that their last order is around 1am - was the only good thing about this place.They do have a good list of unique cocktails/martinis, but they're pricey and not worth the money as both my martinis were diluted. My companions faced the same issues with the potency of their drinks, so if you do go there, stick to the usual beer, hard liquor and ask for your mixers on the side. What's worst, is the service, they were bringing the drinks one after the other, first the bottled beer - took nearly 10 mins - then 10-15 after we placed an order for the cocktails the waiter came about to inform that a particular flavour wasn't available. Finally we got all our drinks 40 mins after the first order, can you imagine how cold the first beer was by then in Singapore's heat. The food came slightly faster than the drinks but nothing to write home about here. Upon meeting the same fate in the 2nd round of ordering we realized that this place is no good for us and moved on elsewhere in the vicinity
3
We were looking for somewhere high to enjoy some night-time views of the bay area, and a little drink, and chose Orgo rather than Marina Bay Sands as it looked to be a bit more relaxed, and it was. Unfortunately that also extended to the service which was excessively pedestrian; a long wait to order any drinks, the waiter/waitress not knowing what one of the ordered drinks was*, a long wait for the drinks, a long wait to pay... That said, it was a very pleasant place to do some long waiting in the evening with great views across the bay and of the downtown area.A side comment: we had real trouble finding the place, Google Maps et al taking us to various different locations. It's actually on top of the shopping mall and fairly well signposted up several escalators once we found the right entrance off Raffles Avenue. * I don't mention this to belittle the staff member's knowledge of cocktails as it can be quite culturally specific. However, if it's on the menu I'd expect a little basic knowledge..

I was there for some drinks and i met the Resident mixologist Tomoyuki Kitazoe and he make the best Vodka martini that i have in this side of the planet,so i recommend and also have a stunning view of the Marina Bay .

We had dinner at Orgo. The venue is stylish and offers a fantastic view on the skyline. The drinks, starters, and mains were excellent. Unfortunately, the service can not match the kitchen. Slow to pick up the order, long waiting times, not clearing the table until things can't be stapled anymore, takening away unfinished plates and half full glasses, no chance to get a second drink unless you jump at them. We would expect a location like this to train staff much better.

The view from the bar is definitively great. it is also nice to have live music at night. However, the price of the cocktails and wines are crazy, more expensive than Kudeta or One Altitude ! We chose 2 cocktails which were ok, but not original as you can expect from a "Organic Chemistry". The bottle of champagne at 200++SGD is really too expensive. You can find much better rooftops in SG

With the iconic Marina Bay Sands & Singapore CBD skyline as the backdrop overlooking the Marina Bridge great place to soak in the view. Located on the roof of the esplanade theatre it's a little challenging finding your way to up there but once you do reach there you find an inviting place you can sit alfresco or inside the glass structures with air-con.The cocktails menu was very exhaustive and the ones we had were very good. The food menu on the other hand was somewhat limited we stuck to the starters and found them to pretty good, the portions were decent. Service was pleasant, my only gripe bcoz of which the place looses a star is that it was dead quite, some music in the background would have done wonders to the place but apparently that particular day there were some restrictions though the staff with whom we were interacting couldn't really tell us what was the issue and what else should we be expecting on a day without the 'restrictions' but overall a great place

It is a nice and maybe romantic location. I don't think it can be a place to enjoy with friends and is more a place for couples. It has an amazing view but it has no wifi, which in my opinion is very important to have especially in that kind of Bar.I ask for a Sangria and got two wine glasses with lots of ice, and a small jug. when I asked the Waiter how much sangria was in the jug he avoided my question and said that it will fill in total 4 wine glasses. That mean that it will be just 2 without ice. It was overpriced for the quantity and the flavour was plain. I had tried better Sangria for lower prices.

What we liked:- Great view on Skyline and Marina Bay Sands- Not too noisy, relaxed atmosphere- Outdoor seating, non-airco (except if you sit in one of the airconditioned "cubicles")What we did not like:- Way too much ice in my friend's Mojito (to the extent that cocktail was diluted to a sort of mint-flavored ice water). The staff handled the complaint well and provided a new cocktail with less ice(although in a much smaller glass)- Drinks were not served together- Pricey, but that is to be expected given the location and viewOverall, nice enough to repeat the visit sometime.We did not try the food, so cannot comment on that

If you're idea of a good night out is being overcharged for small portions of tasteless food while sitting on astro turf with no light but an up light (which means you can't see what you're eating/drinking)...then this is the place for you!If you just want creatively tasting frozen margaritas and a great view over Marina Bay it's great just don't ask to sit where you want to (even in an empty venue they wouldn't let us!) or want any vegetarian main courses......I have been here twice and on both times the staff were either annoying or like something of a frankenstein movie. On both occasions they had a problem with where i wanted to sit despite both times not being full.The 1st time i went it became busy the 2nd time was 3/4 empty and that was a Saturday night so i'm guessing that this is no longer the place to go...if it ever was!I went with three friends the 2nd time and everyone disliked their food which you couldn't see because of the weird uplighting. The decor is trying to hard and the glass boxes just bizarre.There are plenty of other places overlooking Marina Bay where you'll get great food, drinks and service...don't over pay for this one

Not much to say - we were there for dinner with clients. The view is terrific and that's what you pay for. They had us pre-order entrees likely because we were a sizeable group but the food was mediocre at best. The drinks were pricey and weak. Not much to say. I think the views would make for a nice romantic dinner
4
We came to this bar by accident, as another close by would not let us in wearing shorts! ( Do they know its Singapore and you CAN look smart in shorts?) I am glad that we did. The drinks were a bit on the expensive side, but hey, what a view. Cornered market. Want the view, pay for the drinks! It was lovely watching the sun set and all the lights of Singapore appear

Unlike all the reviews below, mine is going to be a good one.The service was spot-on and prompt. We ordered for beer cocktails, pork ribs and stuffed mushrooms. We did not wait for long. Unlike the non-smiling staff in many restaurants, they were smiling and happy to serve us. The Spanish Paella was just deli! DO I have to even talk about the view there? It is the view that draws everyone there. It is enough a reason to visit once. We were looking for a very quiet place with good view and good food and we got exactly that
3
went there on a weekend night in dec 2012 it was quiet. no live music and few people. it is nice if you like a quiet place to chill. location was easy to find, at the roof terrace of esplanade, offering a great view
4
It located on Esplanade's spacious Roof Terrace overlooking the bay, Marina Bay Sand hotels, part of Singapore flyer and the financial center, great view! Like the rooftop views!
Food are great too.

The place was nice to chill out but well.. i guess it is not so popular afterall.We asked for an indoor seats. It was the long table and is sharing with other people. both groups were sitting at each side of the table though... We asked for food menu, and i think till the end of our stay, it did not come.I had a melon beer... guess melon doesn't go well with beer after all. As for the price, I find it still quite ok but of coz I wont want to spend this amt for a location and the small amount of it.Still worth to visit at least once or maybe u can just try by to see before u decide whether to go in or not.And one thing, when we fist came in, the waiter was a little "aggressive". We asked for indoor seats and the first thing he say was (beside the entrance) "Here... There is a room here with a min. spend of $300." The room looks cosy with sofa seat but wow.. 300... lol =.=' not for my group as some are non-drinkers..

We were meeting up with some friends who we hadn't seen in a while & decided to try somewhere different from the usual hang-out spots. WHAT A MISTAKE! Absolutely the worst possible spot we could have chosen.The location is nice enough but the service was just about the worst we have ever experienced.We were 4 of us 3 ordered cocktails & one ordered a glass of wine. The 3 cocktails arrived promptly enough but it was at least 15 minutes & 2 reminders before the wine was brought out (the first waiter, whose eye we managed to catch informed us, he was in charge of seating guests & therefore it was not his responsibility!!) (the ice in the cocktails had completely melted by then). To make matters worse, one of our friends specifically had asked for a bacardi & diet coke, on tasting the drink he was suprised to find it tasted rather different from his usual tipple. He asked our server to confirm with the bartender, what he had served & was told Bacardi & Diet coke. After a couple of more sips convinced something was not right he insisted on going & speaking with the bartender himself. It was only on asking to see the bottle of Bacardi that he realized, not having Bacardi in the bar, the bartender had served him another dark rum & tried to pass it off as Bacardi! The manager was then called over & ur friend chose another drink.By this time the rest of us had finished our first round & so decided to order a second round to keep our friend company. This time the wine & one cocktail arrived within 5 minutes, but no sign of the 3rd cocktail.Each time we reminded one of the servers the answer was "its just coming" . Finally after over 20 minutes we cancelled the order, settled our bil & got out of their post-haste promising our selves never to step in again

This restaurant and bar is hidden on top of the Esplanade. The place is a bit hard to find due to lack of signage, but that is not necessarily a bad thing. We were welcomed by a gentleman who has been mentioned in previous reviews as not being particularly friendly and we felt the same. Not exactly root, but also certainly not a warm and welcoming manager. He offered a table inside or a standing table outside as the only available table outside was already reserved. We opted for the standing table and received a beverage list and wine list. The person who welcomed us actually then outed himself as the sommelier, which is not necessarily something to be proud of as the wine list is rather poor, hard to read and the pages keep falling out. Before we could place the order a waiter offered us a seat on the side with a nice view. We ordered a bottle of wine, but the one the 'sommelier' delivered was not the one we ordered. I mentioned it to him, but he just said: "It's from the same company!" and started serving. I didn't say anything as I wantedto enjoy the evening and just hoped that the price would be the same as what I had ordered (it was in the end). We then ordered a cheeseplatter, but unfortunately the cheese selection and quality was rather poor. Overall, not a very enjoyable experience and we would not return. The owner has some work to do there. The view is nice, but there are plenty of places around with a better one actually

A hidden gem in bustling CBD for a quiet pre theatre/ dinner drinks or post. Fresh fruits make delicious drinks. Bear in mind if fruit is sweet, drink is sweet and if fruit is natually sour (like passion fruit) then the drink will be tart! This is fresh fruit cocktails not cocktails with hints of fruit The bar food seems overly fancy.

The view is great but the service is poor. the food red mullet fillet was salty.The caucasian staff who served us was so blur, infact he wasnt listening when i told him i had made a reservation and yet he replied that the place was booked for an event henceforth i couldnt have my dinner. Finally, when the matter was solved we were given a seat for dinner, food served too a long time and the soda wasnt nice. upon making payment with my credit card after our meal,the same caucasian staff forgot that i was the one who paid using my credit card, wanted to pass the card and credit card slip to my friend for signature.. the service overall is poo

I went looking for live jazz, which was there, and singer was nice. It seemed Orgo was shy of having them there. Even though I was sitting nearest to them, I could hardly hear them.The terrace and the view is nice. The first starter I ordered a Breaded Cod was very nice, but the mains of the Red Snapper was personally recommended by the chef, left me cold.The service has to be rated as poor. The staff seemed so demotivated, and slow
3
as usual my bar hop-hop's trip is always about trying new top 10 mentioned in the media list.. rooftops bar is my favorite usually and the staff was friendly, nibbles selections were taste gud. but my martini mmm.. not like what i expected. and they gave me a fresh grapes to accompany my drinks.. for me it will be better peanuts or other dried n crunchy things that makes and encourage you to order more drinks, no ? yes. but again, other view corner like the bar from onefullerton, fullerton bay rooftop and mbs.. has it better .. anyway it was ok - at least i got a good table overlooking to the other side.. if you want just a very private corner and gud easy chill out chat with someone special, then this is the place.

I have to admit that I did not have any food at Orgo yet. But hey, already the drinks are worth going. It's for sure a bit about location, but at Orgo there is content as well. As with many rooftop bars, it's primarily as spot for nice weather. You will have a nice view onto the Marina, with the Merlion, Fullerton Hotel, One Raffles and of course the Bay Sands.The drinks are resonably priced for Singapore and very tasty. Just go to the esplanade, find the top floor and once outside you will easily spot Orgo. Be aware that it only opens at 5pm

Considering the location this place is quite peaceful compared to other nearby establishments downstairs. We just had drinks here but quite enjoyed them and the staff are really helpful.
3
The food n drinks were over average. However I had mixed feelings abt their service. When I first entered, there was a Caucasian employee who was chatting with two more decently dressed girls. When I approached him for seats, he totally ignored me and my friends, his service was completely poor.However, I was impressed by another employee who served us. He was polite and patient. I would recommend him for the best employee award if there is one.

Amazing location! Either you want to impress a client or simply your girlfriend this is right place. In the heart of the Marina, with breathaking views of the surroundings this place is a little hidden gem. The wine list is impressive yet affordable as well as the spirits list. The sommelier Michele is Italian and has done a great job selecting nice Tuscan red wines (which is not easy at all given the huge variety) along with French and Spanish classic ones. Usually quality comes at a price but prices were not steep at all. We did not sample the food but it looked tempting. Definitely one of the highlights of our trip to Singapore

Orgo Restaurant has revamped their menu! Now there are tapas dishes. The paella and steak are still great. The food is good. The atmosphere is excellent- great night view of the marina bay. Service is fair, but never mind the food and the atmosphere balance back.Tips for visitors - 1. Pick table near the side , better view of the marina bay. 2. Arrive before 9pm , to catch the Marina Bay Sands light show 3. Recommended dishes - tapas - ham and melon. Main dishes - seafood paella, sea bass and beef tenderloin

Not only does Orgo strive to impress my expectations, it strives to expand on creativity on suiting people's entertainment. 2011 New Year Celebration, there was not much to celebrate with, as it was far too crowded with many people as tables & seats were plotted everywhere, causing a claustrophobic atmosphere. As this 2012 New Years came around, I celebrated my new years there once again. This time, not only did it hold less seats, making it more comfortable for people as there was more space, but also Orgo hosted fun little games that was entertaining for the worth while. While many people rate this people on it's food, drinks, and service, I disagree that a restaurant should be judged that way. Yes, foods and drinks are the main components of a restaurant, but other smaller factors such as the creativity are left out of the question. Has anyone noticed the dark colored cube suited for the atmosphere, the way it provides a luxurious taste in the atmosphere? Or perhaps the way it is just merely designed, dark and smooth? Many people still lack the consciousness of the design of environments. Not only does the bar hold a luxurious feel, but also a luxurious feel in taste. The drinks, are most magnificent in flavor as I have never tasted them before. The originality of the drink and organic items not only makes it fresh, but also electrifying. These tastes seem to lock into pieces like a puzzle, and this is one of the main reasons I like to visit Orgo, since it holds a shocking taste to it. The food, on the other hand, is seen as a disgust in many people's views. I don't believe that. When I ordered, the food came quite instantly and tasted deep and heavy. Despite it's small serving size, I feel that it is suitable for the price to be at what it is, or else it won't be seen as a luxurious bar & restaurant, won't it? The Pasta is also nicely boiled, and perfectly sauced so that the pasta would not soak up in the sauce, nor will it be dry being uncomfortable to eat. The Service lastly, is one of the greatest in Singapore I feel. Other restaurants in the United States, Nicholas Yen strives to ask customers what he could do better for his bar to be more suitable. This is my first point, striving to suit people's needs. Since he has an American-ish background, I feel that he strives to bring the trait of Service to Singapore. Singapore mainly lacks service in many places, as many people lack the effort to push and do more, instead of doing the least and getting the pay. I feel that this restaurant deserves more than what people rate. Many of these critics that rate restaurants are merely beginners, they lack the overseas experience in knowing what real service is. This Restaurant & Bar is one of my favorites, thanks to Nicholas Yen and Tomoyuki Kitazoe's wonderful drinks

A curious place high up on the top of the marina esplanade theatre. The food was good. The outside tables are well sheltered but located such that views of the marina are limited. Fortunately its just a short walk to rooftop views of the marina at night. The much recommended laser light show was disappointing

My husband and I were about to spend $200 at Orgo's but we left when the waiter refused to bring me a glass of water. "As per his boss' intructions, I had to buy a bottle".1. Bottled water is eco-unfriendly. How can Orgo pretend it is "Organic Restaurant" while they obviously couldn't care less about environment.2. In any circumstances, refusing a glass of water to anyone is rude, unwelcoming and it demonstrates a total lack of basic courtesy.As a customer, I don't want to patronize these kinds of restaurants and I hope others would agree

I went for a wine tasting session at Orgo on the 1st March with my husband. We had a 5 courses degustation menu with some wines to pair with our food. Surprisingly, I was really impressed with the food that came to our table. The dishes were really done perfectly and not too overpowering. Simple yet elegance. "Especially the Smoke Duck" !! Great Job !! I was told by the young Executive Chef that they just changed there menu, and i think that the prices were really reasonable and affortable. The sommelier was also very knowledgeable telling us about the wine that make us feel so "wow". We will definitely recommend Orgo to our friends from California

I discovered orgo by accident and ever since it has been my best kept secret! It is cosy, sophisticated, stylish and with the most amazing views of the CBD skyline and Marina Bay Sands. The cocktails are not cheap, but they are superb. Mixed by professionals - they even take requests! This is the place to come for F1 weekend with great track side views.

Thsi restaurant is in a wonderful location but the service is second rate. They have no clue how to serve or wait of tables. Menus were just dropped on the table. Nothing explained. Very poor lighting. You had to read the menu by using the lights in the table leg. The staff disappear and when they do come back it's an annoyance. The food is ok to not to bad but really overpriced. 24. Singapore dollars for a very small bowl of pasta. The sea bass as worth a few mouth fulls at even a higher price.Maybe the whole venture is for cocktails and view but then why not become a roof top bar and leave the food to restuarants or even the street carts nearby at Glutton Bay
