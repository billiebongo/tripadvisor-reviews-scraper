The staff is attentive and friendly. The grill steak is below our expectation, however the buffalo wing and cheeseburger are good.
3
Cozy environment with friendly staff. Generous serving of food and overall food was not too bad. However, the steak was poorly done. We were served well done steak while we ordered for medium rare!
4
We thouroughly enjoyed our dinner at Dan Ryan’s Chicago Grill. We ordered three full racks of ribs and they were delicious. A little on the pricey side but the good service made the food well worth it! Recommended if you’re around the area.
5
Food was great- big American portion. Service was fabulous! The server was ever attentive to our needs and very courteous. My companions commented this is the type of service to emulate in Singapore.
3
Very authentic American diner experience. Food was very good quality. Pricing is abit high for the portions.
4
When in Singapore at least once we want an American style meal. Dan Ryan's is an excellent pub with a wide selection of burgers, hot dogs, and ribs. They also have a wide selection of draft and bottle beer.

Went for a datw with my girlfriend, we ordered the clam chowder, half bbq chicken, 10oz ribeye and molten chocolate cake.The clam chowder was the only decent item we had. The steak was unevenly cut causing it the result to be cooked unevenly. Some parts were medium rare as i ordered, but most of it were medium. Some even medium done. The half bbq chicken was too dry and bland in the middle, so my girlfriend didn't finish it.And also, not sure why they served our desert before my girlfriend had finished with her main. Didn't want to trouble them so we just took it then instead of sending it back. So she had to go through the trouble of eating dessert first (before the icecream melts) before going back to her main. Which i would say kind of ruined the taste of the food. Not to mention the lava cake wasn't as good as we expected, where there wasnt as much chocolate taste as we hoped. Vanilla icecream was nice but it came in such a small portion in comparison to the cake. Probably wouldn't eat here again, not worth the mone

Dined here one evening, and wish I had gone anywhere else! Food was covered in butter, even though I asked for no butter, then they had no rice, and finally I got an average burger and lukewarm chips when they couldn't provide my original meal. Apologetic, but no compensation for the poor service at all
4
The staff are well trained. The ribs are good, the mushroom risotto is lovely, the ceaser salad is wonderful , the chopped salad refreshing and the clam chowder in the bread bowl satisfying. The steak platter - set with salads n sweet potato chips is so-so. The steak was not really a good cut.
5
Thoroughly enjoyed our tender BBQ half chicken on a Tuesday evening. Food was tasty but what topped our experience was the staff name Mr Nassri. He was very accommodating and was able to anticipate our needs and made us feel very welcomed. He knows the menu well and was able to give us suggestions and choices. He is a good asset to ur restaurant. Compliments to the chef! Excellent bbq chicken. Thank you so much for the dining experience
4
Nice cosy American atmosphere. Good range of food such as pasta and typical food as well as a range of steaks. Nice easygoing way to spend the evening
4
Tried this as a change from the hotel. Drinks similarly priced as most places. Friendly staff. Quiet when we were in but it was a nice change
4
The beef burger patty was hearty though it could do with a little more salt. Been awhile since I had such a hearty burger. The 2 sides were good of good portions too and service was pretty good.
4
One of the best ribs in singapore! Have been dining here for years. However the service can be improved. Servers are not attentive.
4
After returning mid evening from a tour, we chose to try out Dan Ryan’s Chicago Grill for a late meal. We were greeted by a lovely waitress and looked after exceptionally well. The food was delicious and after the order was taken it wasn’t long and we had it in front of us. Cost wise we couldn’t argue it was comparative to other meals which were not as tasty as we had. One of the best Chicken Caesar salad I’ve ever had. A superb restaurant if you are looking for a good feed
5
My wife and I had weekend brunch on 12th Nov and was served by Nassri, who is very attentive, friendly and prompt. He went out of his way to provide us with service excellence. We have always loved the food and ambience. Thanks to Nassri, our Sunday meal was made even better
4
Good experience for the family; well it is an annual affair for us since our gal was born. Safe environment with good BBQ chicken and ice cold stout. Coleslaw was better last time, but acceptable. Still dun understand the 1-4-1 beers only at the bar and not at the tables, but o well, can't get them all. :

This place has such a long history. A classic place for children and adults. I grew up going to dan ryans in hong kong. However this one in singapore is a bit of a let-down The service is good. The portion size is good. The price is fair. The two biggest let down - quality of food/ingredients. There should be no reason to source cheap ingredients in a place like this. Cheap ingredients esp the meats can be significantly improved on. The ribs are excellent, the rest on the menu is soso. The reuben must contain 5000 calories , when you take a bite into it you can feel the grease coarsing through your veins straight to diabetes/heart attack land. Completely unnecessary for such a simple dish. The chef should not try to compensate quality with quantity. The last issue with this place is the train. The train never works. Fix the train already. It should never be turned off and always moving - the classic signature of dan ryans. The track is so small already just a circular track. The track in hong kong courses through the entire restaurant. Fix these two issues and I am sure it will be a great place again
5
This for a number of years has been our go to family restaurant. The bar area is well separated.There is a wide range of western meals available at reasonable (not super cheap) prices - some salads, meat dishes, burgers, Mexican etc etc. on average with a coup,e of beers it would be about S$30-S$35/ head (mains only, maybe one dessert).Staff are friendly and attentive - great with the iced water!!!Decor is family friendly with some booths and some French art deco posters, moose head etc et
5
Having a big group of us, they gave us a private space which was separated from the main crowd and we felt like home. The female service staff was attentive and is always around us whenever we require something. Even though the prices of food was steep, it was tasty and everyone enjoyed the food. It was a birthday celebration and the staff prepared the cake for us and even provided us with additional candles! Kudos to the female staff (didn't manage to catch her name but she is in short hair with spectacles)! Thanks for being attentive and always so polite towards our numerous requests :
5
Great ambience and delicious food served here. Had well marinated pork chops and nicely cooked ribs. Would definitely visit again
4
A good place on your own or with a crowd . Great food selection and well presented . Good service and a good feel about the place .
4
The food was typical dinner style food. I had steak which was really good. Good portion size and reasonably priced (for Singapore). The service was great and I'd definitely re-visit.
4
Excellent fare for a quick lunch inclusding both quick diner type food (burgers and Asian food as well as salads). Not expensive but good service. Prob not for a romantic night out!
1
Went to dine at 7.45 pm tonight and although the restaurant was less than half full the young lady refused to seat my husband and me as she said she was too busy.
Maybe if you own this establishment you might be concerned.
3
I came here on my first day having flown for 13 hours and couldn't be bothered looking for anywhere special.
Service was good and speedy. Price was reasonable.
Not sure that an American diner works in Singapore though.
5
Great restaurant with friendly service. Portions size are huge for the price. They have some special promotions where the kids are eating for free!Go for the bone in ribeye, they just changed Chef and he is doing an amazing job. I know my steaks and the prime Angus is perfect on quality and taste
4
We went with kids on a Sunday lunch. As this is a bar / diner (not normally our first choice with kids - we are British / Singaporean).Food - good, well delivered diner food. The Ruben Sandwich was great and the kids ate for free. My son said it was the best burger ever.Environment - it's a bar / diner. Done well. TV screens with sports. A train track going round the roof to keep the kids entertained (for a bit). Good mixed crowd. A couple of Aussie lads at the bar watching NRL, a couple of Dad's taking their daughters out for a Sunday lunch, Singaporean family in the main restaurant. Everyone enjoying themselves.Service - great. Fast (without being intrusive). Smiling. Balloons for the kids.Value - great value (after all the kids eat for free with an adult main)This isn't fine dining. Just good quality food and fantastic service.We'll be going back
4
Having just arrived from London I just needed something nearby and simple. Good diner menu - we had the Cajun chicken which was just right. I noticed there were some substantial steaks on the menu if you are very hungry. Service was prompt and we tried Asahi Black which I had never had before but made a pleasant change.
2
Have always liked Dan Ryan's. The food was tasty as usual. Had the fixed menu which included both soup and salad, 8 oz ribeye was perfectly prepared, cheesecake desert was very good, all for s$49 which is very reasonable by Singapore standards. Service started out good when there were only a few tables but quickly deteriorated once a few more tables filled. I can't fault the servers as they were hustling, seems to be there are too few servers available. Management needs to ensure adequate staff levels. Would have rated 4 stars but given I waited 20 minutes for my desert and was almost complete with my meal before I received my glass of wine I've only rated 2 stars. Hopefully service levels will improve
5
Felt like enjoying an American style dessert that is hard to find where I live (Tokyo). The carrot cake was amazing, but huge, I felt bad for not being able to finish it. Try it, but split it with your companion.
4
We had two dinners here as we like the atmosphere and food. Staff were very accommodating and allowed the lunch menu at dinner. Good size meals.
5
We had the mushrooms risotto , chicken roasted salad and potato skin. It was absolutely excellent . The service was good and atmosphere was great.
5
Food is definitely American and plentiful. Staff very accommodating and friendly. Drinks were excellent and not outragously expensive. Definitely the place to go if you want a taste of home. Less than a 5 minute walk from the Regent Singapore hotel.
5
Great American grill and bar. The menu isn't terribly large but you get good wholesome good and great value. This round we arrived about 8pm on a Saturday night so the servers were a bit more harried so did forget out bread basket until they had been reminded twice. Otherwise, they were prompt and efficient. We had their fixed price menu which came with soup, salad, mains and dessert.We were really stuffed at the end of the meal and the food was authentic. Good food, good atmosphere and good service with good value means excellent in my book. As it was getting late by the time dessert arrived, the staff were attentive enough to provide my young son a balloon to keep him occupied. Good work. The paper table mats with markers are also wonderful to keep children occupied while waiting for their food. I would definitely come here again
5
Dan Ryan's is an authentic American style bar and grill restaurant. We've been going there for years. It's still quite okay, but the menu seems to have changed a bit. The evening menu no longer offers burgers, but they will still serve you one on request. The beer selection also seems to have changed, and they no longer offer draft Guinness or Kilkenny. On the positive side the carrot cake is still spectacular and they have happy hour pricing on drinks between 6pm and 8pm
3
We wanted to take my dad to a steak joint for his birthday, but were on a budget. Speciality steakhouses can cost anywhere between 80-150 per steak, which was way beyond our budget. We hadn't been to Dan Ryan's since I was a teenager, but somehow the name popped into my head.The great experience began when I called to make a reservation. The girl who answered was polite, friendly, and accommodating. I immediately felt we'd definitely be welcomed there. When we arrived, we were greeted at the door and led to our table promptly. The female wait staff in charge of our table was polite and attentive, which was great :)I ordered the Prixe set menu (a set dinner for just below 50 bucks!) which was amazing... you get a choice of soup... AND salad (most places just let u choose soup OR salad, so this was amazing), choice of main and dessert. I decided on the AUS 8oz Ribeye for my main. Be warned though, this particular cut is very thin (but reasonably sized), so selecting your doneness is probably impossible. In fact, Dan Ryan's should just say, for this particular cut, that it's thin and only has one "doneness" (I've been to another steakhouse where they told me just that, and I didn't mind... it also helps to manage guest expectations). I selected medium rare but it came cooked medium to medium well (see pic). HOWEVER, it was YUMMY and JUICY. Very delicious. So not being to select doneness is NOT an issue at all for this cut. I'd order it again in a heartbeat.My mother ordered the Fillet Minon medium rare which was excellently cooked and very tasty even without a sauce (FMs usually are accompanied by a sauce of some kind... this one didn't need anything else). The only blemish for the entire dinner experience we had was my wife's order. I think the staff forgot the order, or the order wasn't pushed through. An honest enough mistake. Whatever the case, my wife got her steak almost 20 minutes after all of our guests (she ordered the ala carte 12oz sirloin med rare). The steak however was the right doneness, juicy, and tasty like the rest.In sum, this place should definitely be on your go-to list for medium priced restaurants that sell steak. 50 bucks for a steak, portions are huge, and the ambience is great (half of the restaurant is for seated diners, with dining tables and old-Chicago style booths) and the other half is a sports bar area with high stools and three TVs (they were showing rugby, soccer, AND live tennis!). I'd give it a 3.8 if there was such a thing

I'm a huge fan of Dan Ryan's and this visit was for trying their Fish n Chips as recommended by a friend. The plate comes with one battered fish fillet, fries, and cole slaw along with bread basket. Many places serve battered fish that is wet under the batter but not at Ryan's, that is a big plus. The fish was not greasy but the batter is the bread crumb style, which is not what I was looking for. I prefer the crispy (beer) batter that is hand dipped and fresh. Nonetheless, the fish was excellent but a little too thin, fries were super good as well as the cole slaw even though not a very big serving. I do recommend the Fish n Chips but do not expect London style. As always, the free flow iced tea at Ryan's is the best in Singapore
2
Had a full slab of BBQ ribs with coleslaw and chips - price Sgd 43. Need to buy another portion of fries as original portion was so small.The quality of food was what you would expect from this type of place and service was good.However should not be leaving am American Grill hungry
4
Came here for birthday dinner with my family. Its kind of in the middle of nowhere, but we like the ambiance because its warm, quiet, and feels like a real american restaurant. The food was delicious. We had the sharing appetizer platter with buffalo wings, potato skins and chicken strips. The chicken strips are definitely a miss because it was like frozen boxed strip type things. The buffalo wings ans potato skins were fine. I liked that they were generous with the condiments though. All the steaks were done perfectly as we had requested. My boyfriend and I shared the 24oz bone-in ribeye which was delicious (Slightly too charred on some parts, maybe next time I'll request for it not to be on a hot pan). Our steak was with the set meal for 2 so we also had onion soup, salad and sides - all which were very good. However, I will say the portion is definitely not Chicagoen - or American sized. Which brings me to my dad's disappointment with the ribs. The "full rack" was really small and definitely not slow roasted. The staff were really sweet and attentive. They even sang me a birthday song, and took pictures to email for us. I would definitely recommend this place again, and we will be back to try all the other items on their menu. :
4
Ordered a wide range of food, ribs, steak, soups and side dishes. Food was very good and service was good. The staff make an effort to celebrate Daughter's birthday by singing her the birthday songs when the mini bday cake came. Great Place !
4
Tasty Tex mex food at a reasonably price. Very family friendly. The staff were efficient and service was fairly quick. Good value for money.
4
Dan Ryan's has a winning combination and has been smart enough not to mess with a winning formula. And they have one of the best salads in town for reasonable prices.
4
Have been going to Dan Ryan's on and off for close to 20 years.
Service today was not the best and prices are quite steep but still a nice venue for ambience and the food is pretty decent as well.
4
We were around 50 people last night. The service is good. Not a lot of waiting. I ordered barbecue chicken with their own sauce and it was good. I ordered calamari and it was tender and flavorful!
5
I had the pleasure of having a Friday lunch with work colleagues.
The greeting and service was fantastic. The food was excellent and the portions were very large.
Joanie looked after us and ensured excellent service.
We will be back, thank you
5
This is my favourite restaurant for my western food fix. Reasons simple, staff are friendly, enthusiastic, helpful and warm. Plus delicious seafood chowder, BBQ Ribs cooked to perfection, hot wings, potato skins, Cajun Chicken all in generous serving. Most importantly children friendly. What more can I ask
5
Authentic American food! We've only been here once before and got a burger. This visit was absolutely delicious and one of the best meals and we've had in five years of living in Singapore, not to mention the value....American portions! We chose the Fixed Price Meal for $49 per person. Includes Soup (Chowder or Onion) and Salad (House or Ceasar), Main Course (Choose from Steak, Filet Mignon, Fish, etc), Baked Potato (Add $1), fresh (just enough crisp) vegetable medley (Green Beans, Julienne Carrots, Peppers, and Broccoli) and dessert (Apple Pie & Ice Cream or Brownie & Ice Cream or Cheesecake & Ice Cream). The French Onion soup was amazing, Ceasar Salad was one of the best in Singapore, 10oz Ribeye was perfect, as well as the baked potato and very nice portions for dessert. We took some food home. The service was friendly and she kept our glasses topped up with home-brewed iced tea! Going back for fish n chips next time
2
Choosing it lacked imagination in such a diverse and well-served city, but still it deserves to be said that the simple dishes on the standard pub grub menu take little preparation to get right. Poor food. Slow service. Only partly mitigated by the good sport on TV, the good company,the friendly clientele (a la Cheers)
4
Dined there many times. Great location and atmosphere. The burgers are great and the ribs fall off the bone. They onion soup wasn't great, but the fries and fresh bread more than made up for the soup. They have two fixed price menus that are a great value. The only draw back is they are not flexible on substituting sides on entrÃ©es. Servers are very abrupt at times. They seemed focused on turning tables. Maybe because a 10% gratuity is automatically added in. I felt hurried to finish and move on after my meal. Rude service can ruin even the best of meals
5
Will visit at least 1 per month.
Recommend the combo patter, chopped salad and pork ribs. So delicious and worth to try again and again.
3
Typical American sports bar with main sports shown. Huge portions of steak, burgers or fish. Lacks a bit of atmosphere though. Perfect to dine alone and watch some sport in peace if that's what you are after.
3
This is a good alternative if you want to have a juicy steak. The waiters are service minded and you will leave satisfied.
3
Solid American fare, Overpriced. Service seems to be hit or miss as I have been several times. I would say its worth a shot.
4
We were there for a friend's pre-hen party dinner and booked a table for 7 of us. As it was a Saturday night, there were a lot of big groups like us. However, service was still prompt and personable. We ordered several plates of food to share (ribs, seafood platter, potato skins, broccoli and risotto) and everything was delicious! We were especially amused by the broccoli as it was really two big bunches of broccoli! The serving was huge and all of us had our fill. Suitable for family and big group gatherings
4
Everytime I would crave for ribs I would always have Dan Ryan's on top of my list. Their half slab ribs with salad is enough to safisfy me . Followed by a nice cup of coffee with a generous sliced piece of their Carrot cake. Yummy ! The restaurant is easy to reach from Orchard rd and it has a really cool set up and relaxing ambience. Prices are reasonable too
4
Nice burgers, nice Philly cheesesteaks, (that was a surprise). Good soup and chicken strips. Generally the food quality here is good. No cheap filler foods. The strips were very plentiful for an appetizer, not just like 4-5 pieces like you might expect for an appetizer. Full plate sizes. The Philly cheese steak was much better than I expected from this part of the world. Very nice thin cut beef that tastes like it was supposed to. I would have melted and mixed the cheese inside the meat a little more than they did, but on a scale of 1 (all wrong) and 10 )100% right, this was a good 7-8. The desert brownie was more than decent. All in all a good place. Not cheap but very reasonable by Sing standards
5
I have eaten here a few times a year for more years than I can remember.Restaurants in Singapore tend to come and go but this one has stayed, and it has stayed good.I am not a fan of the Chicago char grilled steak.However, the standard char grilled strip loin is consistently great.The serving is a good size and simply presented and tastes great.The atmosphere is friendly - personally I prefer to eat in the bar area - maybe my Aussie upbringing?I have eaten many steaks in Singapore that have cost 4 or 5 times what you pay here, and they certainly have not been that much better, if even as good.Highly recommended for steak in Singapor
4
I absolutely love the atmosphere of Dan Ryan's and it's quite close to an American bar (as seen on TV as I personally have never been to America). I think this place offers the most delicious chili I've ever tasted and I like coming back here for more. Their nachos are pretty good, but you can't really go wrong with nachos. I've had the calamari for the appetizer and I think the marinara sauce complimented the calamari very well. I quite enjoyed the main course - the rosemary roasted chicken along with fries (changed from mash potato). I've enjoyed my time and the wait staff are very friendly. I'd definitely recommend it to friends to come here for the chili
4
Dan Ryan's is styled on an American steakhouse and is located near to the heart of Singapore's shopping area , Orchard Road. The steaks are very good and the service is excellent . There are cheaper steak options in Singapore and more expensive options but generally I would say for an American style steakhouse experience with quality food this is a good place
5
Walked over from Reagent to get something to eat after a late arrival. Everyone enjoyed their dish. I ordered the "Fish & Chips". Nice sized filet, flavorful and plentiful. Service was great! Will go again for sure!
5
Perhaps my favourite steakhouse in Singapore. It can be pricey, but the US steak is fabulous. Excellent variety of beers to choose from. Service is great. A nice place to spend your Valentine's Day, but be sure to make a reservation.
5
Overtime I stay overnight in Singapore I make sure to visit Dan Ryan's. They have a small American selection of beers and Dr. Pepper that makes me feel like I am back in Texas. I always go to get a good Caesar salad. Living in Asia it is difficult getting legitimate Caesar dressing and Dan Ryan's has it! Then I also get a bowl of Chili. Hands down my favorite chili this side of the Pacific. I look forward to eating at Dan Ryan's every trip here
5
This is an excellent American style diner, with a very authentic feel. Service is good and the food is nicely presented. I've been to Dan Ryan's many times over the last 20 years and it's never really disappointed me. It's reasonably priced by Singapore standards. Budget S$70 to S$100 per head depending on how much you spend on drinks
4
The place reminds me of good old bars where one can come in, sit alone at the bar counter and leave the bar making good friends. The draft beer is fresh with a prompt service. We had the ribs, fries and risotto served piping hot. Try the chocolate lava cake - it was delicious
3
Well, it was a Friday night! Thought the place would be buzzing. So I booked a table for four at 8.00pm.....Not a soul in the restaurant. Just a bunch of Aussies in the bar. I went for the large sirloin. It was great, all the sides were great too. My friends and I had a lovely meal. But the place was dead. The location of the restaurant maybe the reason ( it's a bit on the quiet side, seems quite a residential area). Certainly in my experience not the food. It may have been just a quiet night. I hope so, but alas I feel that the perpetual evolution and constant change and choice in Singapore may have left this place behind
3
Reviews on this eatery were generally awesome about the restaurant and the food.Since it is an all American grill, I ordered the Sirloin steak. I like mine medium done.I felt like something was missing. It was filling but I was not satisfied. Something in the taste that did not ignite the gastronomic experience I was hoping for. The french fries was good though! I will highly likely not order this again if I were to visit the restaurant again.The dessert on the other hand ... Yummy. I had the Molten Chocolate Cake. I loved it.The melted chocolate oozing out was just warm and nice. Would be better with a vanilla ice cream I think.I wanted to end my dinner with a cup of cappuccino but was told the cappuccino machine was not working ... So the waitress kindly suggested I try their Americano with milk. I did. Because she was nice. It was not a bad idea. The coffee wasn't bad too. Better than most hotelsâ€™.When it comes to service, I think they have one of the best ever! Greated well at entrance, when seated, while seating, while eating, while drinking, before leaving and as I was leaving! All around excellent service. The kind of place you feel comfortable hanging out with friends just munching fries and sipping wine or coffee or whatever tickles your pickle
4
My son and his family took me to Dan Ryan for a late dinner one evening after our visit to watch the Sakura display at Gardens by the Bay one evening. We shared a selection of ribs, buffalo wings steak and side dishes. We all enjoyed the great food.Service was very good, making us very welcomed. Prices were not cheap, but then it was Singapore after all
3
We went there for dinner celebrating my mum in law's birthday. 10 of us. Food was great and service was good. We spent $661.50 for everything and when I was checking the bill, I asked the waitress who served us from the beginning if there is any credit card promotion or discount given. She told me that she will check with her manager. Then she came back to us explaining to everyone that the restaurant is giving us a credit voucher which can be use during Monday to Thursday which worth 10 DOLLARS! in a sarcastic manner. When we are leaving the restaurant, she came up to me and apologised for being blunt and I start to realized she was trying to insult me for asking if there is any discount. She is having short hair and a small tattoo on her left arm that looks like rat but she claim that it was a cat. I was a quite upset by her behavior towards my request. She can simply tell us in a nice way that the restaurant is not giving discount and we are still glad to pay for the good food. I was a frequent customer who always recommend this restaurant to my friends and family but it was shocking this time
4
The service and attention here is always great -- they really aim to serve and make sure the customer is satisfied. Drinks are cold and beef dishes are reliable and very satisfying. The restaurant has a rule about hamburgers being at leat medium well (I prefer medium rare) but somehow they alays come out juicy, tasty and satisfying. All big and reasonably priced plates
3
Located near by Tangling Mall is an American Restaurant, service is good and fast, food is fine.
I would recommend the mash potato with gravy by the side, the taste of pure potato takes over your mouth each time. The nachos are also recommended.
4
Great food, service a little rushed but then everything was excellent. We had the set menu and everything was well served.
Even the coffee was good :)
5
I hadn't eaten here since I and family left Singapore in 2000. What I love about this place is the great food, large portions, and escape from the noise and crowds of other restaurants; and Singapore in general. It was and remains a hidden gem. I've seen a few negative reviews, and suspect written by expats that need to go home for a reality check (or a stint in KSA, as in my case). Highly recommend for good American bar food and cold beer
4
We were looking for some good old-fashioned American food for dinner and Dan Ryan's fit the bill. We ordered and enjoyed the burgers and ribs. We ordered a side of broccoli, which was HUGE, and tasty. The decor could use some freshening up, but we had a very pleasant meal, with good service, in a comfortable setting. Good location just off Orchard Road, as well.
3
Kept passing this place in taxis and it took a while to get round to trying it. It was a short walk from where I was staying and a little bit tucked away. The food was decent with good size portions, service was ok, however it was very quiet the day of my visit and therefore was a little lacking in atmosphere.
1
A friend and I came in here to try out. Normally I do not go in without reading what they say about the place here on TP. Everything start nice with a nice young girl who sat down and took the order. My friend got a phone call, stood up immediately to take this. 1 min later, the soup we ordered. My friend comes back after 10 minutes when they've already tried to serve our main cours to me two times. I said of course, oh no my friend not even started with their soup. Now the time for the same beef again. I said Direc this is cool, I want a new .She says that we can fix but next time as it is served medium, not medium rare as I ordered. I said I wanted a new and warm MR she came back and said to the kitchen to fix a new one. I said thank you is an angel. What about 2 minutes later, the same beef out heated and well done I said excuse me what is the problem I myself cook and ask what they have for professional honor in the kitchen. We ate and took the coffee in another nicer place that takes care of its customers .. One would expect more for 40 S
4
If you want a good steak with chips then go no further. They have a good selection of drinks and waiting staff who just make the visit extra special. We had a ball. The service was quick and efficient. The steaks were American size. Most importantly they actually serve authentic Chicago style Buffalo Wings. Now that is not easy to get anywhere outside Chicago
3
Was there on 1st July for dinner and got two Independance day set which was advertise to come with a note pad and Independance day "T"Shirt. Promotion was for the period from 1st July to 4th July or 5th July in celebration of 4th July Independance day. Upon finishing our meal and payment, i ask for the free gift which was to come with my meal but was told there was no stock and was given the note pad. I requested to speak to the manager and he certainly took awhile to come. The restaurant was quite empty and he walk pass us a couple times without acknowledging us till I had to call him. He was arrogant, and was standing in an aggressive manner with eyes that was piercing that i called him. Unfortunately in a customer service environment, he just kept repeating no stock and can't give us. Also said the gift can only be given on 4th July thus my question, your advert says otherwise and I have the note pad, Isn't this contradicting. Unfortunately, he replied he is sorry and can't give to us. He thereafter told us to come back to collect on 4th July which was very inconvenient for us.We then suggested that he post it to us to which he agreed and also will email to us some voucher on 4th July which we have not receive any.Honestly, the service standard of Dan Ryan's has drop tremendously and they have to resort to false advertising. Very very disappointed as we have been a regular customer since 15yrs ago with the ambiance little change which draws us. This incident will definately make us think twice before making a meal appointment there again

My family was hungry for American food and Dan Ryan's hit the spot. The food was good and fresh and the portions were just right. Even my 12 year old got full on the kids cheeseburger. Will definitely be back when we are craving food from home
4
The service was ok. We had to chase our drinks order and the food didn't all come at once for everyone in our party, but The food was good. One of our party had a special diet and they were very accommodating though. The restaurant wasn't all that busy when we were there so not sure why the service was mediocre.

Typical US-style steak and rib restaurant. Can be loud as sports bar directly adjacent to dining area. Popular for drinks.

Myself and my new wife really fancied a nice cold beer whilst spending a few days in singapore,.this place while not to everyone's taste was unassuming and really welcoming,didn't try any food so can't comment on that
3
Food was average, albeit overpriced. Servings for desserts (we had the apple pie and cheesecake) was huge. However the service was a complete letdown. It was a special occasion but it didn't feel at all because of the bad service rendered. Was served a by a Indian tall employee who didn't even bother looking into our eyes when taking our orders. Thought it was just his attitude but seeing how he served a casuasian lady just behind us proved otherwise. He was extremely friendly with her and even came over to ask if the food she ordered was to her liking. He obviously brushed pass our table without the same treatment. Advice is not to visit this place if you're a Singaporean cos we obviously don't deserve any kind of service. Very very bad experience
3
The quality of the food and service was average but I have to agree with previous comments on the size of the Main Course. The Calamary we had for starters were a huge portion, also a Caesare Salat weas a very good size but the full rack of ribs came with about 10 French fries and a thimble full of coleslaw. Although the ribs were very nice for the money charged I would expect a more generous portion.
4
We came in to the place at 4pm and asked for table for 2 without reservation and they asked us to take the bar counter tables as they were fully reserved. But when we left before 6PM, majority of the tables were still unoccupied. :( Ordered the chicken and ribs platter, onion soup and vanilla milkshake and tea. A basket of bread, cake and butter was given to us for a starter, and the butter was too addictive!I was supposed to chose the flavor of tea I want, TWININGS brand. The waitress came with a box and read out all the teabags available and was stuck at "Darjeeling Tea" as she couldnt pronounce it. Realised most of the servers were mandarin educated and couldnt speak good english. The chicken came as a big portion, skin was very smoky but the meat on the inside was bland, had to eat it with chilli sauce. Good thing the breast meat was not very dry. Ribs were alright, slightly better than the chicken. Fries were awesome!!! Loved it but they came in small portion. Favorite dish was the onion soup, very tasty and unique.Vanilla milkshake had strong milky taste, great for milk lovers like me! Overall, commendable except for the service

I like my Ribs.. and Dan Ryan's definitely ranks up there with the best of them I've.. the pork ribs were yummy and tender!! The hot barbecue sauce that comes with the Ribs is excellent.. also considering that the cost of dining out in Singapore, I thought Dan Ryan's was pretty good value for money..
1
i travelled with my two teenage kids and husband in Vietnam and Cambodia for three weeks and ate at at different places every day and we had no problems with food at all. Three of us went to Dan Ryan's in Singapore spent over $100 (just for ribs and pasta meals, no drinks or desert) and my daughter was vomiting by 3.00am. The next day, she was fine, that is, it was food poisoning, not viral. This has happened on a previous visit, which we put down to something else, couldn't believe it could be Dan Ryan's, but here is no mistaking it this time. Never again
3
My wife and I went here for dinner. The place is a typical "western" eaterie in Singapore, booth seating and a selection of tables and chairs. There was also a bar area where you could watch sports etc. I had the ribs and my wife had a burger (which was not on the menu and we were surprised that the didn't appear to have any so we asked) The food was okay, nothe special. The service was okay the night we went but this may have been due to just a few tables being occupied, I would anticipate it going down hill the more patrons there were to serve.This is not the cheapest place to eat, and to be honest there are better grills offering. Ore food at a better value around Singapore
1
Terrible portions and slow service. Although the food itself tasted good I would not go again. $42 for a full slab of ribs. A full slab was 8 ribs while the juniors meal was 3 ribs, the juniors was $9.50 which was a much better value. The portions were tiny and there was not enough sauce. It also took 50 minutes for our food to arrive and the waiters would never come when we waved them over. Would not go again
4
After reading many of the prvious Reviews I was wondering what will be expecting me at this place which is close to the Hotel Jen where I stayed Result: big positive surprise. Being quite early in the evening I got very prompt and friendly Service. I really felt being welcome! I opted for the set menu and got a good value for the money. The apetizers with a soup and a Cesar salad were ok, but nothing extraordinary. However, the filet Mignon was to the point I ordered and was extremely tasty, juicy and tender. Thankfully the portions were much smaller than what was written "threateningly" in the menu. The whole dinner was rounded up with nice "Calzone-style" Interpretation of the apple pie with ice cream. All in all a very nice experience. But clearly if you want to go on a tigh-string budget, you have to look elsewhere..
4
Great food, very american-ish diner, pity not a lot of american beers available. other than that, good was great.
4
The ribs here are really good. Not the cheapest place to eat but a good meal. We came here as a family all the time when we lived in Singapore 20 years ago and it's still going strong! Get a Keyring to remember it by.
4
Steaks and burgers all round. Good selection of beers. Service was pretty good too. The only thing I had to question was the wine which tasted like it had been watered down.
4
Good steaks, great Chile, reubens, hot dogs, nice staff, good beer, for singapore prices are reasonable, what more could you want?
3
Ate there twice in this month. Went on my own the first time and as a guest the second time. Steak was mediocre. Good ambience and attentive staff? A bit too pricey for an evening meal.
2
I had been in Singapore for a week and fancied some western style food for a change. Steak was my goal and Dan Ryans my destination. I had clam chowder there before and it was great so my order was pretty much made up before I even sat down. I was alone and was shown to a seat at the bar. Nice sports TV to watch. I waited and then waited and guess what, I waited. A young man came bouncing in, sat at the bar, was almost immediately served with a beer and I still sat and waited, and waited. And then walked OUT! Never again. Appalling servic
5
Love coming here. It's the best true American style steakhouse in town. The meat is awesome, best cuts around. My favorite is the Chicago style char-broiled steak. As a side dish they also have the biggest asparagus I have ever seen! And cooked perfectly. Love the buffalo wings with real bleu cheese dressing on the side. And to top it all off you must try the molten chocolate lava cake. As an expat who lived in Singapore for many years this place is definitely one of the best for western cuisine if you want a taste of home. Good location near to Orchard Road
4
We dropped in to Dan Ryan's by walking from the St. Regis hotel up the street. After we ate here, we were surprised that our hotel never mentioned Dan Ryan's as a steak place when we'd originally asked for something like this nearby. The cocktails were great--a decent Manhattan, finally, after being "on the road" for two weeks in Indonesia. Mixology protocols vary all over the world, as you know. The steaks and side dishes were definitely served in an American style. Maybe not the most "haute cuisine," but definitely a good filet and not crazy expensive. The service was excellent, very friendly, and we would highly recommend dropping in for a meal here. The restaurant is a little hard to see from Tanglin Road; you have to walk downhill from the main street to the restaurant entrance which is on a side street, in the back. Definitely a good place to get some alcohol and protein
4
I had my reservations about visiting this restaurant, but since it was our first night in Singapore and being tired we just needed a quick bite to eat that was close to our hotel. This restaurant fitted the bill but being a chain I was expecting something mediocre. However the place was surprisingly good.Friendly staff, a lively atmosphere, and good food. Portions are generous, there are set menus if you don't fancy the a la carte, and a good range of beers. My steak was cooked perfectly and the accompanying vegetables were crisp.Would recommend a visit.
3
If you're looking for uncomplicated US style food in Singapore you have found the place. This is a typical steak house restaurant that doesn't disappoint. The food is to the standard you would expect as is the service. If you want a large steak at a reasonable price look no further
3
Whilst I did have the option of not going once they told me that their ovens were on the blink, I could still order cold food. I choose to stay and the food was lovely.

Visited this restaurant and a goodish meal but quality was only average. Very quiet on the night we went so shown to table straightaway, service good and ambience ok. Reasonably priced and close to our hotel. Ok for a good convenient meal.

A classic American-style restaurant set in dark wood and vintage lights, fixtures and posters, Dan Ryans Chicago Grill emits a hearty, open and relaxed ambience that instantly makes the diners feel right at home. There is also a bar where one could enjoy a drink or two before meals commencement; or after-dinner drinks as well.Seated comfortably in a booth, we had a hard time deciding if we should go for the enticing set lunch, or order from the Brunch or A la Carte menu. Everything looked good, and we were ravenous. We finally made up our minds, and decided to keep the orders to a minimal because they stated there in bold that they "Serve American Portions"... ahhhh, a kind reminder to smaller-eaters to please not over-order and waste food.The main courses were served before we finished our basket of bread and soup - something that left us somewhat perplexed as the current items already took up most space on the table. In fact, the overall service was slow and the wait staff often tended to overlook guests trying to get their attention.We had the Rib-Eye Steak with medium doneness. The steak was succulent - tender and lean with very slight hints of fats that added to the crispy chewiness of the meat. The taste itself was superb, flaunting its red-wine marinated flavor in a subtle overture. We also tried putting tiny speckles of salt (the dish came with two types of salt on the side) onto the steak, and this brought it to another level of deliciouness entirely - not too much, just a few tiny grains please. In fact, even the seasonal vegetables and fries served with the steak tasted great as well, especially the thin, crispy fries.Our Fisherman's Platter basically consisted of three types of fried seafood - cod fish fillet, squid and shrimps (yes, the menu stated "scallops" but we did not detect it in the platter). Nonetheless, it was tasty and not greasy. Edison* thought the cod fish fillet was a little dry, but the overall review was good. The coleslaw was refreshing with a strong tinge of onions, and the lovely thing is the minimal use of mayonnaise as dressing. This gives the coleslaw a light, crispy sweet flavor instead of being mayo-polized.For more detailed information and photos, do visit:http://thearcticstar.blogspot.sg/2014/01/lunch-at-dan-ryans-chicago-grill.htm

Eleven of us visited the restaurant one evening. We were accomodated quickly and the order taken quite promptly. The staff were helpful and service was pretty good considering preparing food for 11 at a moment's notice, most plates were cleaned off. As it's Singapore the beer/wine seemed quite expensive, but all in all it is a thumbs up
1
Have Lunch at Dan Ryan Singapore and was very disappointed that I was at the verge asking for my money back* The Chowder Soup had a texture of a custard- very thick and heavy* The Caesar Salad did not have beacon bits, sprinkle of parmesan cheese and very little dressing* The M/R Scotch steak was tough and not even Medium * When I ordered coffee- they served percolated coffeeThat sums up the class of meal standardChoo Loo

Having always drive past this place, we finally decided to give it a try during New Year's Eve. Situated just slightly outside of the Orchard Road shopping belt, it is definitely easy to get here. Despite the close proximity to the Orchard area, the place is surprisingly not packed, considering that the food is pretty decent and reasonably priced. Initially we were a little worried about portion size, as the menu says 'Warning, American portions' but turns out it was manageable. We tried the chowder which was really hearty. We also tried the buffalo wings and onion rings, pretty good as well. For mains, everyone in the party chose a fish dish. The ingredients were really fresh and for me, I enjoyed my fish and chips. I like how the fish was being encrusted in a light layer of breadcrumbs as opposed to the typical thick batter at other places. We would have loved to go for dessert, but we were pretty stuffed by the time we finished our mains.Will definitely come by soon to try the other dishes
5
While visiting Singapore if you have a craving for Western style food this is the place. The food is great , the service is the best , the atmosphere is awesome and the prices are reasonable. I don't think you will be disappointed, very easy to find
4
I've passed by dozens of times, but today I decided to try it out. They have a fairly decent selection of steaks, Strip loin, Filet Mignon, T bone, Rib eye etc, and some other dishes like chicken, pork chops, pork rib racks etc.The first couple of steaks in the menu are "charred Chicago style". I tried the 16oz strip loin medium rare inside, charred Chicago style outside and it was quite nice.On the menu, all the steaks are listed with fries. Personally I prefer mashed potatoes so I asked if they could serve the steak with mash, to which they agreed.Before the steak, I had a beer with sweet potato fries. I also had a glass of red wine with the steak
3
Typical American Steak House. Long Established. Steaks are good and a big variety of cuts. Evening dinner is busy and the restaurant is popular, with locals and Open till late. I also went for lunch one day, but was very disappointed at the set lunch menu selection. They can do much better if they so choose. .

We had 4 Adults and 5 Children in our party. The restaurant was accomodating to give us our prefer seats in the restaurant. We have not been back for a long while (one of our friends who used to work part time at Dan Ryan's during her university days and that was about 18 years ago!). We were surprised how the taste of the food is still pretty much the same!We had a really great waiter who understands true customer service! It was a farewell party for our dear friends and he helped us with ordering just enough food (usually I go overboard with the ordering because my eyes are bigger than our stomach) … took care of our needs because we have young children as well. So, two thumbs up for him (sorry, for the life of me, I cannot recall his name! But he work black rimmed glasses and is definitely about 1.75 to 1.8m with a boyish hair cut)We ordered ribs, caesar salad, onion soup, chili corne, wings, potato skins, calamari, roast chicken, pasta, apple pie, cheesecake. Everything was good except for the apple pie (sorry but that was a low light for me … I think they've changed the apple pie to a calzone … the filling tasted like the canned ones. I am an apple pan fan so this one is an 'F'). I love the chill corne! It was the highlight for me :)We went on a Thursday night so it was a cozy crowd. Not too many people and it was a relaxing and comfortable evening spent having a hearty meal, laughs from adults and children and service was good. I hope our children weren't causing other diners distress … apologies!This is one of our family's favourite restaurants! I agree sometimes that there is room for improvement for service and some food items … but we will go back again
2
Food was a bit disappointed, felt more like microwaved fast food than quality, had a chili that came out in 30 seconds with a cracker.
4
Just across the street from the St. Regis, this was an excellent choice for a quick meal. Typical American fare is offered at a reasonable price.
4
We eat at Dan Ryan's each time we visit Singapore. Burgers are good and they serve Dr. Pepper soda. Staff is always friendly. Temperature is usually cool inside.
5
Relaxed atmosphere,onion soup and hot wings a delight.Staff friendly and look for the locomotive chugging around above the bar.

I was there for dinner with my wife at about 8:30pm. When we entered the restaurant, there was no one to serve us at the door. That was not a big deal as the restaurant was fairly filled and we were attended to by the next available staff. However, when attended and told we needed seats for 2, we were told immediately that there were no seats as all seats were taken or reserved. Then there were empty seats by the window next to the bar counter and when we asked for those, the staff said, "you sure you want those seats?" Rude service staff no. 1While ordering, the service staff took our order, with no order taking sheets nor repeating what we have ordered. I'm certainly sure this is not the proper way of taking orders as I have worked in a restaurant probably more casual than Dan Ryan's and still adhere to proper procedures when serving a guest dining. Rude service staff no. 2 While having our dinner, though I have had better caesar salad at Dome cafe, my wife and I enjoyed the delicious rib eye and the fries were well crisped, we decided to take away the rest, including the cheese cake for dessert and asked for the bill. First, I received the take away, excluding the dessert. That was not big deal, as the staff could have misheard, or simply not paying attention to details of request. However, when we received the bill, the service staff handed us the bill just by hand and not in a bill booklet. At that point, Dan Ryan's service level is received at beyond minimal, it was such a disappointment as I expected at least some respect. And just prior to receiving our bill, the service staff was handing over another bill to another paying customer in a proper manner, I do not see why I would be given "special" service. and he has the guts to say " oh because we are busy, I couldn't give it to you in a proper manner". My wife told the service staff that this is a rude, the staff replied, "I'm sorry about this" but what i heard was more like he meant to say "I'm sorry but i'm busy can you take the bill and leave now?" So we asked for his name, and again "here is my name, Pus Parajan, I'll give you a comment card, you can write on it and I can give it to the restaurant manager" Very Very RUDE service staff no. 3! Strike 3! That is not an apology. Dan Ryan's Chicago Grill, Singapore, you may have a good team of kitchen staff, but with the attitude of the service staff, your restaurant service is worse than any food court in Singapore. You need to re-address your staffs with proper standard operation procedure. If he was a supervisor as he was wearing a different uniform than others, I would question his performance.I doubt I'll ever visit Dan Ryan's again. Nandos at Tanglin Mall would have been a better choice
1
We are used to Dan Ryan in Hong Kong since I believe 1989 and like the menu, especially the Chicken wings and the potato skins with a glass of red wine and get what we like with a good volume of nice wine.I have been to DR in Singapore some time ago and we were this time passing by for lunch.We were placed in a windy AC area and ordered our favorites and a glass of house wine.The waiter seemed very untrained and somehow totally off!The waiter comes back and asks us if we really like to have some bread and then brings one muffin and one pcs of white bread. We asked why one pcs of each as we were two guest and are told that that was the policy of DR in Singapore.We were rather upset and cancelled our orders and asked for the check for the wine.As they saw that we were upset the wine was on the house
4
I visited Dan Ryan's for the 5th or 6th time on this last trip to Singapore; it has never failed to delight. I was joined by a handful of coworkers and customers, and we had a fine dinner and excellent conversation. There's a couple of things I particularly enjoy about this restaurant -- the decor, which is unique; the size (big enough to feel uncrowded, but small enough to feel intimate and personal); the food which is generally very good and sometimes excellent; and the staff, which has never failed to delight. I'd like to focus my comments on Ryan's excellent staff because it is a major difference between them and other restaurants. First, our young waitress had us all laughing and relaxing in very short order. (I wish I could remember her name, so I could compliment her properly!) And that's great, because in an age when more and more commerce is conducted by computer terminal, its fun to be in a restaurant that obviously and actively recruits people who are lively, fun, clever and involved. To my eyes, the staff seems to go out of their way to customize their style to different guests. I noticed a romantic couple over on my left, and the staff left them pretty much alone except to freshen their wine. Our group was lively and ready to relax; a couple of guys sitting at the bar were laughing with the mixologist behind the bar. There was a large table of asian people sitting adjacent to us, and the staff was properly more subdued and respectful. So everybody had the same very good food, but each group enjoyed a very different kind of Dan Ryan experience. To my mind, that's great service. So what about the complaints from "Howzatinn" and his disappointing meal? Are the meals actually frozen and portion-controlled? I don't know. Is there a five-star chef lurking in the kitchen, ready to customize exotic meals for us? I didn't see it. I see steaks, chicken, salmon; some great starters and tasty veggies and good drinks. That's what steak houses do. It's not "Le Circ" or "The Quilted Giraffe." Or even the Russian Tea Room. And for me and my weary, jet-lagged companions, that was just fine and exactly what we needed
2
Went there on saturday night, expecting to have nice grilled steak but...starter was onion soup which i would say was good, caesar salad was ok, as for the garden salad, i felt like a cow. whole bowl of greens with just 2 tomatoes and few shreds of carrot.Main - i had ribeye medium rare and hubby had sirloin medium. texture of the ribeye wasnt tender but doneness was ok, hubby's sirloin was medium rare too so he informed the waitress that he had ordered medium so she brought it in and recook the steak. The steak returned but it became well-done, it was disappointing given this is a reputable steak house.Dessert - we had molten choc cake and apple pie, again another disappointment. the texture of the molten cake is too thick (too much flour) and the apple was hard and tasteless. The chocolate ice cream was good.Service - After we had the soup, immediately the salads were served. The waitress who served our table seemed to be rushing us to finish our food all the time, she kept asking if she could clear the bowls when am still having my soup. then immediately, she cleared our starters, she brought our main, so in order to enjoy our dessert, we informed her to hold the desserts for 10mins after our main. Yet again, the desserts were out in less than 3mins!!Overall - wouldnt return again. with that price, there are better places with better service and food quality
4
We walked past this restaurant just last Saturday evening after having been there before once in the early 2000s, and the food did not disappoint us.For appetizers, the potato-skin appetizer and onion soup is a must-try!I had a main course of fish n' chips while my partner had a mushroom risotto, and it was really a very filling meal at a reasonable price.The plate of mints offered at the end was a nice touch that is missing in many other western restaurants we've been to. And so was the basket of bread that was given right at the start of the meal.I really liked that the decor was still the same after so many years, and it really gets one feeling nostalgic about this little restaurant as a piece of Singapore's history that has not changed at all when everything else in the city has
3
The menu didn't offer much in the way of interesting fare so I ordered the ribs. The ribs were not as tender as they could have been, though the taste was pretty good. The coleslaw was a little different--seemed like an Italian dressing base. I do like the fact that they have American sports on the TV screens
2
Our only visit was for drinks. The usual Dan Ryans decor, clean atmospheric, however $A65 for four beers (small ones) I dont think so. No wonder it was empty.
4
Steak n potatoes for brunch . Loved it! One of the best scrambled eggs I've eaten. However blueberry pies were kind of over rated. Need more blueberry taste to be frank. Total $32 cheap meal. Love the decor .
3
Not impressed. Below average quality food and overpriced. Service was awful. The place was subzero temperature which was uncomfortable.
I won't be visiting this place again. .
4
What more could you ask for on a hot day but have some very cold beer and good pub food. Gets crowded after hours
4
when you feel like some western food in an asian city this place is great for the family or a bunch of blokes . the service is quick and the prices are good
2
This used to be a very good American restaurant that we loved, especially the sautéed mushrooms and ribs. We have been there many times late 90s and early 2000.Back to Singapore on a visit, we were looking forward to our dinner at Dan Ryans again. Unfortunately, the food quality has dropped to a "just edible" level. The sautéed mushrooms now lacks the aroma and taste, and the fillet mignon set my wife had was really bad. Fillet mignon I supposed to be the best part of the cow, tender and juicy. Despite being medium rare, the entire piece was covered with veins, and basically "unchewable".....I brought this up to the manager, who gave a nonchalant reply "oh, is it?", and remove the plates.There was no further follow up, and we left feeling very unsatisfied with the bad food quality and service.Really missing the Dan Ryans of the 90s....
2
Dined there tonight as I spotted it on the way to my hotel from the airport and salivated for some spare ribs. My first impression when I went into Dan Ryan's was why are all these little kids carrying baloons in here? Did they perchance mistake this for McDonalds or is this where their parents wanted to dine so decided to have a children's party here?Moving on though, I was directed to the bar and made myself comfortable going through the menu. I decided on spare ribs, chowder andfinished off with chocolate ice cream. Now the food itself was OK, nothing special but passable. What was notable though was the service and frriendliness or lack thereof. I have to say that the bar staff were very busy rushing around tending to customers but what was lacking in all this activity was a total lack of frriendlless or smile. It wasn't that they were impolite at all but just that they looked so unhappy and miserable that it was contageous and I started getting the feeling that I wanted to just finish my meal and leave before I caught whatever it was.Now, I'm definitely not a connoisseur and I dont really mind what i eat so am quite easy to please and I think that in this case, if the staff were friendlier, I'd probably feel as if the food was better and dismissed the little kids running around.Which just goes to show, service is everything and can make good meals better and mediocre meals good.The meal wasn't all that cheap either, S$55 for a mediocre meal and less salubrious service
4
Been going to Dan Ryan's on and off for about 15 years. Went there for lunch the other day with the family. I like the fact that they hire handicapped staff. This is an excellent practice. Food was alright but not the best. Would go back again but not in a hurry to do so
4
My husband and I travel occasionally to Singapore and I didn't realize until this last trip that there was a Dan Ryan's around the corner from our hotel. We used to go to Dan Ryan's regularly when we lived in Hong Kong, and then Taiwan. Being from Chicago, I used to love the decor, especially in Hong Kong, and we enjoyed many birthday parties, after work drinks, and late night bar sojourns for comfort food. We now live in Malaysia, where it's impossible to find really good deli food, so during our recent 3-night stay in Singapore our first night had to be a Reuben sandwich at Dan Ryan's. We went on a Friday night about 6:30pm and the restaurant/bar were nearly empty. The decor is tired compared to the Hong Kong branch but we were there for the food, not the ambiance. The staff was efficient but offered us the dinner menu which confused me as there were no sandwiches listed; turns out that there is a separate lunch/bar menu. My husband ordered a cheeseburger and I ordered the Reuben. We also ordered the house Sauvignon Blanc and a Cab Sav; quite decent for the price/venue and 3/4 glass serving which was generous. We were not disappointed with the food...a juicy (huge) burger for my husband and I was in heaven with my Reuben sandwich and fries. We had a second glass of wine and were far too full for dessert. The price was also very reasonable as it should be for a comfort food/deli meal.Our second night we went out to a chic, upscale restaurant. There are so many good restaurants, of all types, in Singapore that we should have gone to yet a different restaurant on the third night, but I knew I wouldn't be coming back to Singapore any time soon so I have to admit we went back to Dan Ryan's for the same meal. My arteries may not have been very happy, but my stomach and grunge-food-taste-buds were. (And even worse was that on his return to Malaysia a few days after I had already left, since it's just a 1-hr flight, I asked my husband to get take out from Dan Ryan's of 4 Reuben sandwiches to bring back for us/our neighbors in Kuala Lumpur....pathetic but true and I will going back to this restaurant for a dose of more comfort deli food every return to Singapore...I wish there was a branch in KL!)
4
Dan Ryan's, located next to The Regent Hotel , has been around for many years and we have visited the restaurant many, many times. It still looks the same , great ambiance and a super choice for a casual dinner with friends. If you reserve a booth it is a great venue for a romantic dinner.Food and service consistent and always good and reasonable
4
A good wide selection of beers. Steaks were OK, nothing flash but reasonable. Service was good, pricing fair. Close to Traders, Regent and a few other hotels.
3
The ambience has a good old Chicago feel and the ribs delicious but the portion is not great and the price is expensive even for a Singaporean. Unless you can't get to anywhere else, then settle down for a meal at Dan Ryan's.
5
Great steaks at a good price, clean, well staffed. Enjoy a steak and drink every visit to Singapore at Dan Ryan's.
4
Prices are very fair on food and drinks. Popular venue for locals.
Staff friendly and polite.
3
This was OK but the menue inside differs slithly from the one displayed outside.
5
This restaurant is tucked away from the main Orchard Road but in walking distance of most major hotels in Singapore. The ambiance is great with comfortable seating in a booth or at a table. The food is well prepared and service is excellent. Good selection of wine and other beverages. Great for customer entertainment as it is quiet with great food

I am getting into the habit, it seems, of writing reviews as I still sit in the restaurant, which is a bit of a worry or it means I really need to say something! We have been loyal customers from way back in 1995, and I have to say, we are now disappointed, mind you, we had a less than average experience in Hong Kong in February, but we chose to overlook that based on our loyalty, but, enough is enough. Tonight we walked into what we had always regarded as a 'friend', but this friend's welcome was not so friendly.....in fact, quite diffident. They have chosen to downgrade their wine list, no longer offering any Rose wines, despite their growing popularity, worldwide. The ribs were not anywhere as good, in fact, I would say lack lustre, not tender, and served with total indifference, the wines are horrendously expensive and not well chosen. We could not face dessert, and when got the bill, we were glad we didn't! And when the bill came at the end of the meal, it was very hard to know where the value was, particularly when 10% service charge had already been charged, for a single course meal and a bottle of wine at $157.70 (Singapore) which was far too expensive for what we got. We probably won't be back even though this has always been a sentimental favorite

Dan Ryan's is owned by a sucessful Taiwanese buisness owner that "copied" the feel of a Chicago 1950's style restaurant/steak house complete with pictures of the original Mayor Daly. Dan Ryan was a famous Chicago politician along a many other well known Illinois figures, many corrupt. But back to the food. It's good burgers and rib's and feels a little like home (I'm from Chicago) even if it's a little fake. Nice popular bar and is right next to the Regent hotel where I usually stay. Whenever I can't decide where to go Dan Ryan's wins out

We tried, and liked, Dan Ryan's despite some negative reviews. Warm and friendly atmosphere. Philly steak sandwich, burger and all kinds of eggs Benedict for breakfast. If you're there for dinner and not keen on meaty mains, ask for the sandwich menu. This is obviously a popular local, with regulars, which indicates to me that it's pretty good. Three large screens around the bar show different sports channels. Love it! My son wanted to go there for breakfast and dinner

This is just okay american food. I ordered a club sandwich and it came out a huge, tall sandwich. I took out several layers. The meat was fine but the mayo was not american quality mayo. The fries gave the impression they were battered first before frying. The pickle was good

This is the place where I fell in love with Clam Chowder 20 years ago.

Just near Orchard Road this pub feels like you are in a Chicago Irish bar. It has dim lighting, sports on the TV and offers a selection of beers. It is a welcome retreat from the busy Orchard Road.

Food goes well with the atmosphere for a simple moment with a loved one or a small family

Dan Ryan's was first conceived in Hong Kong as a US type sportsbar copy. Unfortunately the Singapore branch is not anywhere near its brother in Hong Kong. Its unfortunate location already puts a damper on potential opportunities. The bar area has this dull and tired feel to it ..not helped by solitary older expats who sit and drink waiting for time to pass The dining area is popular for the office crowd, family events etc ..and yes the rips don't disappoint, nor does the clam chowder ..but thats about it. Unfortunately its not a place where you would want to return more often .

We wanted a western comfort food meal so decided to try Dan Ryan's. Having previously on a couple of occasions been very disapointed with the service at the more well known Chilli's at Tanglin Mall.Our Waitress Noel was attentive, polite and well informed. She advised us that my wife's chicken main course dish would take 20 mins as it was cooked to order. We were fine with this as we were in no hurry and enjoying our bottle of Merlot. I ordered the full rack of BBQ ribs which came with french fries and coleslaw. We requested that our meals were served together at the same time. So often in Singapore dishes will not come even remotely close together. We were pleasantly surprised to see our food served together well within the quoted 20 mins. Whilst our food was not the best Ribs and Chicken we have ever had, they were fine The Chicken was good. The Ribs tasty, a little tough and the sides of French Fries and Coleslaw not at all generous. Our total experience was good enough that we would return but its not a wow place

first impressions was that the place looked very nice the look of the place really attracted me but that was as good as it gotthe food was BLAND and lacking in flavourthis is the first restraunt i have been to that the only sauce they provide with the steaks in BBQi ordered a 10oz rib eye steak medium to well done - the meat was tough and had very little flavour, i actually liked the complimentary bread they served rather than the $42 singapore steak they sold meat least the bread was freshThe Service was good but that was it - i left with hungry belly - going to go get something from another plac

Three of us on business in Singapore visited Dan Ryans for some American fare Dan's used to be more of a sports bar but that has been toned down somewhat. We had the ribs, filet mignon, and rib eye steaks. The ribs were excellent and the filet and rib eye were good. What was great was a set price menu consisting of French Onion soup (yummy), 1/2 a rack of ribs (very good), and a NY cheese cake dessert. The cheese cake was served without any topping so I asked about strawberry or rasberry sauce and the waiter brought out some strawberry puree that made the cheese cake just excellent. The carrot cake piece my colleagues had was huge, more than enough for two people and it was also very good for not being made in the US. Service was good and the atmosphere was fine. All in all..a very good meal

We went in as a group. When the food arrived, they turned the lights really dim. When we asked them to increase a bit as we were having a team conversation, they said this is their standard dinner setting.I ordered pork ribs, they were quite tough. Not sure if it was over cooked, didn't enjoy. The apple pie wasn't great as well

We are from the Chicagoland area, so this is comfort food/atmosphere for my husband and his colleagues when they travel to Singapore. I guess they broadcast Chicago Bears football games live. Food was fine and although nothing special, I would go there again. Not as pricey as other places we ate at in town. Shares an alley with Traders's Hotel where we stayed

In the US this would be considered bad. Frozen-cooked food, average portion size, but above average price. If you have to go here, stick to the soup and fries and call it a day! Do yourself a favour, if you are looking for American, go to Chilies in the mall next door

The best time to go here is for weekend brunch. They have great brunch menu until 5 PM.

We dined at Dan Ryans because it was close to our hotel (Traders) and the time had come to eat some basic American food after almost three weeks of travel. I had noticed this restaurant chain while we were in Hong Kong but did not dine there as we were looking for more local cuisine. The food was average at best with two people having the ribs that were tough and lacking in flavor. Another person had the fish and chips. The first piece of fish was good but the second piece was spoiled tasting and was not eaten. All the sides were just OK. The fourth person had spagetti and said it was fine. Service was friendly and efficient. I really don't understand the many good food reviews but the last review was over a year ago and restaurants do change. Should have gone somewhere else for chicken rice

Very, very blah. You can do better. The staff is nice, which is about the best I can say. Food is mediocre burgers, steaks, chips, etc. OK if you have kids and are desperate for something simple - the decor and bathrooms are tired and depressing

First time in 5 years we were re-visiting this restaurant. The food was disappointing . The lamb on the rack was good but pity they never found their mint sauce for us. The seafood platter and the baby ribs were at best so-so. The key lime pie was not nice . The molten cake was not too bad

Friendly service. Oyster shooters a unique experience. My steak was ok. Decent clam chowder.
