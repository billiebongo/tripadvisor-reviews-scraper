Had lunch with my colleagues there at this restaurant. The Cha Siew is a Must!! Worth every calorie!! Try the black toufu too.
5
Reasonably priced. Char siew single portions starts at 300 grams giving you the option to order and adjust your portions upwards with 100 grams increments.
4
Char Siew and roast pork plus good beer. Cannot ask for more. Char Siew was tender and juicy. The roast pork and beer complimented each other very very well. Consistently good as well!
3
Tasty, but small portions. Popular, so it gets very noisy at times, especially with small children crying.
5
We had amazing food there 100% recommend. The pork is absolutely delicious. You can get there very quick from China town by metro .we have paid about £38 for two people .
4
Arranged group lunch at this restaurant for a table of 11pax.We ordered 2 plates of 600g char siew, 1 plate of roasted meat, 1 claypot, 1 charcoal toufu, 2 plates of crispy eggplant and pumpkin strips, 1 vegetables and 1 plate of duck meat.Had a yummy and fatty lunch today
4
The richly glazed BBQ meats are succulent and aromatic. But the roast pork is unfortunately more than the bite size and not as convenient to have a full taste. Other dishes are of good quality as well. Definitely worth a visit. Btw, the location has been changed to Jalan Besar, near the Soccer Stadium
5
Amazing food but you need to like char Siew which is their speciality but we also had other yummy chinese dishes. Just their desert list is pretty bad ... ha ha but I assume you donâ€™t need anything after a good lunch. Atmosphere is pretty basic but hence a very authentic feeling. A visit worth while
5
After hearing recommendations of the place from friends, radio-Class 95 (Lunch tips from Yasmin), we pop over one sat for lunch to try it out. The place is what is raved about, a nice place with nice food at a reasonable price. The service was also warm which made the meal so much more enjoyable! Disclaimer - we went for lunch at abt 1pm on a sat afternoon and there was not much of a crowd there.The signature char siew is to crave for!! although at $6 per 100g it might sound a bit expensive, the price tag will melt away once you pop it into your mouth as the meat is wonderfully cooked till tender and you taste the sweetness in the sauce and the smokiness of the cooking process.Another dish to go for would be the Salted Egg Pork, although it might sound like another iteration of the overused salted egg sauce, the combination of chomping down onto salted crispy fried prok it a great idea and i think most other zi char place will copy this idea soon.Besides the pork dishes, the double boiled chicken soup and 3 treasures spinach are also highly recommended! you can taste the depth of flavour of the base of the 2 light dishes, the stock used must have been carefully prepared.A dish which we did not really enjoy that day was the Cold Chicken appetizer, perhaps i was expecting a Si Chuan spicy cold chicken type of dish, however it turned out more vinegar-ish than spicy, nonetheless it might be more suited for those vinegar lovers =)Overall we would highly recommend the place for all and if you can afford the time, pls do make reservations for dinner and the premium slow cook char siew, if their signature char siew are already so good, i have high expectations for their premium char siew!
4
If you eat your char siew with the fat, this is the place for you. If you want to be challenged to remove the fat from the char siew before it goes into your stomach, this is the place for you. Be sure to book a table (I did mine via their facebook page) even if it is for 2 persons
4
Great ambiance, succulent Char Siew that is sticky and fatty but delicious. Found the soya sauce chicken and roast siew yoke to be decent though everything else was ok.
5
Great food and service at a reasonable price. Easy access from the mrt and will be dining there again on our next visit to Singapore.
5
The food and the service here are great. they even stock brewdog beer.. although its is very expensive.
4
"char siew" is suppose to be char siew. No offend to those strong supporter of Char. The "char siew" here is , yes tender but nothing near "real cha siew"Some one mention "best char siew in Spore or JB" Has he/she tried "Fatty Cheong of ABC Market" and there is another of similar name (but in chinese) at Redhill Food centre.This 2 is very good - for me but the best char siew I have eaten in in KL ... Meng Kee, Fatty Cheong has to stand aside but KL is too farBack to Char - other dishes are good and very good. So i have to say "sorry" to Char's Char Siew fa
5
The resturant has move to Jalan Besar from Guillemard to since early 2016. This two story shop house could take 40 to 60 cusotmers. This is the comfort-food resturant whenever we are craving for great Roast: roast crispy pork, Char Siew, roast duck & chicken. The sides of soup of the day, vegetables, and noodles are great too. Service is fast and no-nonsence. Love it when they do not charge for tap water or push bottled water, healthy and sensitive to the environment! For less than S$20 per head you could have a real satisfying meal. Highly recommend. It is a popular eatery, hence advance booking is advisable
5
The best Char Siew (Cantonese roasted pork) I've ever had, I couldn't find any better in nearby regions. You have to pre-order your meat in multiples of 150g, don't assume that they have available char siew, because there was once I arrived without pre-ordering and did not get to have any. They have since moved to Jalan Besar. They're on Uber eats too
4
The restaurant has moved. Check their website for new location.Dined on a Monday evening though it seemed they were usually closed on Mondays.Had their renown Char Siew. There's a min order of 300g at SGD7/100g. This is really why you would go along with their roasted pork belly.The Char Siew is really dark and served with generous sauce on top of it. It was a good balance of lean and fatty meat. Rather pricy but great.Their pork belly with bean curd casserole was also good.Service was good. Would return more often if not for the price
4
No competition - This is the absolutely most delectable Chinese roast pork! Done to perfection with charred bits yet succulent and melts in your mouth. Other dishes which were good - salted egg pork, roast duck and crispy roast pork. Service was brusque and impatient. The ambience is noisy.
4
Went to this restaurant for lunch on a weekday. The restaurant wasn't too crowded even it's peak hour, perhaps the location isn't good.The roast pork and char siew is delicous, and the fried noodles is also good. However, the price is expensive, min $18 for 1 dish of char siew
4
We arrive right after lunch hours.. around 1.45 pm. The restaurant was relatively empty except for 10 or so customers.We ordered the usual roast meat and Char siew. The Char Siew was a tad too sweet. Our vegetables - Sambal morning glory was excellent. It contained the "wok hei" that I like. Another dish - pork otar was good too. A very unique taste, marrying pork and fish paste and spices. Will definitely return.
5
The char siew was one of the best I have tasted! Other dishes were very good too like the egg plant, Salted fish fried rice, Beef hor fun and crispy prawns. Will come back again.
4
Loved the char-siew and roast pork! Another must have at this place is the Shredded Duck Noodle Soup. The broth was light yet flavourful, and the quantity is good for sharing between 2 & 3 people. The roast duck is so-so only.
5
Char Siew to go place. Char Siew is uniquely good and tender.
Would recommend having the Roast Pork, Yang Chow Fried Rice or Beef Hofan (or both), Hot and Sour Soup. Garlic Kailan or Sambal KangKong
4
We both really enjoyed our two dishes here. We had read a lot of good things and can confirm they are true! Luckily only a short walk from our hotel.
4
I always like coming to char because the food had always been yummy. The roast pork was moist and the skin was crispy. The char Siew was sticky and fatty. Personally I would prefer the roast pork than the char Siew but the char Siew is still something you should try. We also had great lotus root soup and salted egg pork. They were delicious. Another must try is the aubergine. I don't normally like and eat aubergine but this place made me an aubergine lover. Do note that you should pre order the roast pork and char Siew before come. They usually run out during dinner service in the weekends.
5
This is my 'go to' place for takeaway char siew and roast duck in Singapore. Also recommend their special fried rice, their hot & sour soup and their French beans with minced pork and chilli. Pricey compared to some of the alternatives around but in my opinion worth it.Probably order takeaway via Foodpanda from these guys about once every two weeks
4
I'm not an expert on Char Siu by any means. However I loved it the first time I had it 4 days ago in Singapore and spent the rest of my time trying to track down the best version of this amazing dish. I went to Char on a recommendation from my Airbnb host, it was a short walk from the shop house I was staying in. Go earlier because they run out of roasted meat by the end of the night. We got lucky and bought the last 300g for $20. Delicious sauce but didn't have that charred crispness I've really come to like in my Char Siu. If you're in the area definitely stop by
4
Was here for a family dinner with close to 20 of us including children(age 2 months to 16) The Char Siew is very good, the sort you have in KL. $6 per 100gm. Similarly the roasted pork. Love the fried Kway Teow which is like Penang style and the aubergine claypot
5
If you like pork then you need to try their special char Siew with their own secret sauce. Rest of food is amazing as well. Looks like the owners have put in a lot of effort and love in setting the place and menu up. Well done
5
good quality roast meat. I particularly liked the roast duck which seemed to be better than in similarly priced restaurants. I also thought the hot and sour soup was very good. a lot less corn starchy than elsewhere. The salted dish fried rice was worthy of a mention too
4
The Honey Roasted pork is its speciality and its definitely a must try for folks who love juicy fats. The place is also suitable for gatherings with friends and family.
5
Wow, I love the meat here but the new place has a great selection of draft beer that isn't that expensive, especially during happy hour, lots of space and great staff. I love it here. Their new lunch menu looks amazing too.
3
the BBQ pork was my favourite with fatty part which melts in the mouth! (thick cuts are worth noting)
we ordered the 2x selection for $27
4
This is the exception to the rule that Singapore does not do mid-range eateries well. Sous-vide Char Siew-style roast pork that literally melts in your mouth, along with well prepared side dishes (I'm a big fan of the aubergine) and craft beers, what more can you want? Admittedly, Char hasn't been located very conveniently since its inception. It's moved to a larger space on Jalan Besar and branching out into pub territory, but I think anything built on their savory pork belly will do well
5
I found Char to be an oasis of pork and soup. I sampled more than one variety of pork and thought it all to be very good. Maybe not quite as crispy as I had in mind, but still great. However, if you are a fan of hot-and-sour soup, you need to try it here. I've had that soup all over the place and this was the very best I've ever had. Delicate, complex flavors. I returned a second time and got it again.I also liked how I could order the pork in 100-gram increments. It takes the guessing game out of how much you'll receive and pay for.Service was good without being hovering. It's not a big place so maybe try to get here on off-peak times
4
Chanced upon this restaurant while driving Jalan Besar Road.Walked in and was shown to our table.Read that their Char Siew and Roasted Pork Belly was awesome.Sadly, they ran out of the pork belly (Saturday night 8.30pm).Anyways, we ordered up some soya sauce chicken, Char Siew and some green veggies.When i put the first piece of char Siew in my mouth, wow.. i understood what the rave was about. Absolutely succulent melt on your mouth kind.Dinner overall was good. Only thing i didn't like was that the walls were stark, plain cement.. with a couple of pictures... this made the full restaurant shriekingly noisy.Will be back to try the Roast Pork Belly for sure.Strongly recommend this eatery
5
A new style of dining in Singapore that effectively combines local cooking with international beers and wines! We love the industrial design of the new space. It's a typical tze-char restaurant that has been reinvented but while keeping the same great local flavours. The sweet fatty bbq pork (char Siew) is the standout dish. There's a nice fat to meat ratio, and the black sweet marinade it's smothered in is the bomb. The crispy roast pork belly (sio Bak) is also excellent. The skin is salty and crackling, while the fat has been rendered nicely, imparting juiciness and flavour to the meat!The other dishes are quite good as well. We order the butter chicken (chicken in a salted egg yolk sauce) and the vegetable with three eggs regularly. The selection of beers and wines is quite impressive for a tze-char restaurant. The helpful waiters can recommend something to go with your order
5
They closed the smaller venue and moved to the current location on Jalan Besar. It's now located over 2 floors. Still noisy and echo filled because of its bare walls and bare floors (in a closed A/C environment).Their roast pork loin (cha siew 叉燒) is still the same quality and flavor as my last visit (almost a year ago). It's tender, moist and evenly marbled where you don't even need a knife to cut through the meat. Normally, I'd take a photo of the dish before we dive into it... this time, we were too hungry to even waste time on photography.Seems like the waitstaff have a lesson or two on learning how to judge every table's needs. Beverages were slow to arrive and refills were hard to come by
4
This place is great, cool vibe with friendly staff, we got the x3 selection with the duck, pork belly and Char Siu, all super delicious, very reasonable prices and generous portions too. (-: Only problem is the plates that the food was served on weren't warm and the AC is set to -5, so soon the food was as cold as can be )-
4
I visited Char with friends who were based in Singapore. We decided to order many different dishes to share and I personally don't remember all the names but everything was delicious. We had a vegetarian dish with eggplant, Char's Triple Roast and some prawns. I especially loved the Char Siew and the prawns!
4
tried the roasted pork. It was really good. Bought guest from Indonesia over, they really love it too.
2
Went there to buy 1kg of char siew
Taste ?? Mmmmm
Meat and sauce not blend together when u eat . 1st try good
2nd try so so
3rd try enough
4
Quaint little eatery along Guillemard Road that serves cantonese-type dishes. They have a roasted meat selection but the char siew is the bomb. Menu has been refreshed and spruced up. Worth a visit. Pls make reservations as it's a small shop.
3
The charsiew platter, with minimum order of 300g at $6 per 100g is too much for one person to eat. There is a one person set with 100grams of char Siew though but this is not printed on the menu nor did the waitress how much this cost. Although the Char Siew was extremely tender and melted in the mouth, it's primarily due to the huge percentage of fats in the cuts that's enabling the softness of the meat. I wouldn't go back again. There are loads of places selling excellent quality char Siew at a fraction of the prices her
3
Came for the famous Char Siew but ended up feeling the Char Siew is a bit too sweet to our liking. Maybe a few pieces each should be sufficient. The butter prawn on the other hand is worth trying as another side dish to go along with the rice.Definitely should make booking before coming as after 730pm, there is a large crowd
3
Went there for dinner, the famous char Seo is like stew lean pork, and the roast pork is much too fat. Not value for money, it's just something new. There are other much better roast meat around. Although with. Booking still got to wait, looks like everyone who went has a booking. Service standard poor Abd having so many staffs running around dis organised . Will no go back
4
Char Siew was definitely one of the best I've eaten. Soft, tender and melts in your mouth. My idea of comfort food any day. The other roasts were so-so. Owner was top notch in service. One of of our dish was blant (we think the chef forgotten salt) and owner cancel the dish on the bill and told us that we would not have to pay for food we don't like to pay for food we don'
4
Very good taste! Way better than most of those so called chat sew in SG. It is very close to the authentic char siew you can get from HK and Guangdong. Also, please try avoid most of Char Siew in those food courts or eating houses - - taste terrible
3
While its true that their roasted meats are well done, they are nothing spectacular. Roasted pork is not as crispy and flavorful as those I've tried elsewhere. Char siew is quite good and does melt in the mouth but taste is just so-so. The other roasted meats are quite forgettable.Their other stir fry dishes are all too salty, which tend to overpower the roasted meats.Service quality is rather lacking too.I may patronize again but definitely not on the top list
3
The foods are good. One of the best char siew in town.HOWEVER, customer service need serious improvement... We understood the pressure of having a table turn over as quickly, but please stop reminding us every 2 minutes... I would rather order take away next time... (if there's next time
5
Tasty and tender with a most delightful carmelized sauce, Char has some of the best Chinese roast meats in Singapore. It' is melt-in-your-mouth quality at its best. And don't miss the fried rice and the Sichuan hot and sour soup,
4
We had roast pork, char Siew dishes which were delicious. Fried rice was done with high heat so it tasted smoky. The service was good with constant top up of Chinese tea
3
Over rated. The Char Siew and Roast Pork were wonderful on 1st bite. But the law of diminishing return kicks in as early as the 3rd piece. I have no problem with fatty meat but only if it's done correctly. Somehow, the fats in the meat doesn't hold together very well. After the 3rd piece, I felt like I had just drank 1 whole gallon of oil

Char Restaurant was started in Jan 2014, run by 2 brothers from the UK, Alvin and Anthony Ling. The casual dining restaurant is known for its traditional Cantonese roast meats, cooked with a modern twist using Western roasting techniques and a blend of Asian and Western herbs and spices.The menu includes its signature roasts starting from $10, with “Zhi Char” dishes (like Chinese-styled seafood, meats, and vegetables) for $10-20 per dish, fried rice/ noodles for $10-$12 and drinks ranging from Chinese tea, to British ales, beers and ciders. You can get the full menu online on their website.Our rating for the place: 7.5 out of 10 (ambience: 7, service: 7.5, taste: 7.5, presentation: 7.5, value-for-money: 7). Overall, the meal was good, but the only truly outstanding dish for us was the char siew.For more information and photos, refer to our blog: http://angiekayexplorer.com/2015/06/14/review-of-char-casual-dining-restaurant-cantonese-roast-with-a-modern-twist

What I liked most about this restaurant is the fact that craft beer is sold here which pairs well with the kind of food served. The Char Siew is indeed very tasty BUT the portion served to us was very fatty and oily (you could see the oil swimming in the dish) which made it a little too hard to stomach after a few pieces. A real pity as it really tasted very yummy. The roast pork and roast duck were nice and the Claypot Aubergine with minced meat was a good recommendation from the staff. Do take note of the portions as we were 2pax and we ordered a mix of 3 roast, a veggie and fried rice and when asked if it was enough for us, the staff mentioned the mix roast's portion is good for only 1-2 pax, hence we added a Claypot dish. However, the portion for the 3 mix roast was more for 3-4pax and eventually we had to doggy bag the roasts and the Claypot dish. Not sure I would return as the thought of the oily food makes my stomach queasy

This restaurant is part of a cosy growing entertainment enclave in the Old Airport Road that appeals to both locals and expats. It's most well known for its version of char siew, and I imagine that it's rare that customers don't order it. Having tried it, it's certainly delectable, and the fairly generous slices served are a nice change. The roasted crispy pork belly's pretty good too, so it makes sense to order both these dishes as part of the triple roast combination. On the night we visited, service was brisk and the waiting staff were nicely attentive.If there's something I could change about the place, it's the wooden stools that customers sit on. I realise that it's part of the look the owners chose for the restaurant and it does suit its casual atmosphere. But I stand a lot at work, and sitting on stools tires my back out a lot. Having said that, it's certainly a restaurant that should be able to gain a decent reputation for good affordable local favourites
3
Their signature dish of Roasted Char Siew was delicious but I felt that the dark rich color of caramelized syrup was overdone. It made the Char Siew looked burnt. But the meat was tender though a little fatty.Their spicy Szechuan Hot Sour Soup was okay, along with minced pork with Aubergine in casserole, Butter chicken, Dou Miao with dry scallops, Hor Fun andTriple roast. Overall, this fusion style may please the Western taste buds but for an Asian it may be a new hunt until the desire goes off..
4
Known for roasted meat, we ordered the Char Siew (barbecued pork). The Char Siew came served in a wooden chopping board with a side of chilli paste and horse radish mustard for dipping. The pork had a rich dark color from the honey glaze that caramelised during the roasting. The meat was a bit on the fatty side which kept it moist and tender. This however left a greasy feel in the mouth after a few bites.http://passportonthetable.blogspot.com/2015/05/char-guillemard-road.htm
5
I went there with friends for dinner.The place is nice and very popular, so be prepared that you might need to wait a few mins for a table (or make sure to reserve one).The roasted pork was really good, the other dishes were fine.Altogether it was a very pleasant dinner and I can highly recommend the restaurant
5
The cuts used in the traditional cha-siew (叉烧) are well marbelized between fat and lean meat. Each bite is perfectly balanced. My party of 4 almost had a heart attack when we heard they were out of the pork loin roast upon being seated: we argued that the reservation was made from New York City 2 months ahead. Our 2 night Singapore layover included one night dining at Char. While discussing our options among ourselves, another waitress came up and told us we can have the pre-order from a cancelled reservation... crisis averted.Their Sichuan spicy chicken (麻辣子鸡) was a disappointment and tasted like a poor attempt at kung pao chicken (宫爆鸡丁). OBTW, the place does not have great fung shui (风水) and is noisy (bare floor and walls)
5
The roast pork is to die for. Char Siew tasty but maybe a little too charred. Service is excellent and friendly. Always busy. Make sure to make reservations. A must try for ALL.
4
Heard about chars from friends. Gave it a try, my opinion is that the Char Siew was tasty, good and slightly sweet but the other meats were just average. Will revisit but would just have the Char Siew.
3
As the name suggests, char siew (and other roast meats) is the best seller. Apart from that, the food served here is typical local Chinese food, or "Tzi-char" in local lingo. I suppose what makes the concept successful is local food offered in a contemporary setting. We went there on a Saturday evening and it was packed. There were people outside waiting to be seated, although most had made reservations. I don't mind the food and service was efficient. But for someone who lives in the western part of Singapore, I doubt I will make a special trip there unless I happen to be in that area
4
Char was introduced by a friend, a bit for for us coming from Holland Road, but it was a worthwhile experience. The char-siew was interesting and came on a wooden board with thick, caramelised sauce was a hit with the kids. The roast pork belly was equally good with nice crackling. We also had a stir fried green and hot and sour soup. Three adults and 3 kids polished off 900 grams of meat! The minimum order for each meat dish was 300 gms at $8 per 100 gm. The restaurant is simple, but comfortable and air-conditioned (thank goodness!
5
We went primarily because of location and recent rave review in New York Times. We were not disappointed. Uniquely prepared char siew is their trademark. It is just scrumptious with unusually thick slices of meat prepared in slightly sweet fabulous sauce. Minimum order is 300g. Husband and I were surprised that we polished it all off. Also enjoyed kailan and hor fun, but don't skip the char siew. Ambiance is inviting but plain and small. Do make a reservation. Geylang neighborhood is a fascinating mix, not yet spoiled by gentrification. Easy walk along the river from Dakota MRT station. Lovely.
4
Nice, comfortable, spare dining area. Quick and attentive service. The food is good, as noted by others. Somewhat different than usual char siew. My favorite dish - and an old standard - kaolian fried with garlic. In an out in less than 1 hour.Bill came to a little more than $40/person including one beer
3
Geylang is currently undergoing a similar phase of gentrification not unlike Joo Chiat. Char is a typical example of wanting to do something more interesting with what so far was mainly hawker style food. While we liked the ambiance of the place and did enjoy the food I can't say we were majorly impressed. The Char Siew was certainly interesting and different, but the black caramelised sauce was too sweet and rich for us. The other two meat dishes we tried were of good quality but I can't say all that much different from what one would find in a hawker centre. This is not a bad place by any standards but unfortunately does not quite live up to the expectation either
4
The char siew is indeed unique, not like the others that I have tasted.The meat seems slow roasted resulting in tender fall apart meat that mixes with the melted fats for added flavor. The black caramelized sauce is sweet and may be too plentiful for some. Overall a good experience. The Been Hor Fan is good, best shared among two pax given the siz

Firstly, if you're going to go, best make a reservation. Perhaps I chose a fortuitous night where everyone wanted to be eating here, but I saw quite a few people queuing outside to wait for a table to free up.The roast meats are the stars of the menu, that's not a secret. Go for a whole serving of the char siew, it should be sufficient for a hungry party of 2-3 people with accompanying bowls of rice. We had the trio (although the char siew proved to be so popular we ordered another plate of the char siew), that was a good way of trying out the restaurant's offerings, especially since it was our first time there. The char siew is cut thick, with good marbling to the meat. Each mouthful is filled with the texture of the pork and the sticky bits of fat (definitely not one for the weight-watchers), and the flavour is rounded up by the sauce that drenches the plate. The sauce is a sticky mouthful of umami goodness, but I had to have rice accompany it as anything after a few bites of meat left a cloying sweetness that was getting a bit much.The siew yok was delicious. The crispy skin gives way to juicy meat, and the chili sauce meant for dipping compliments the meat well with it's slightly tart flavour. The chicken was good, though nothing memorable. We had a serving of sambal kang kong, which was good if a bit too garlicky for my personal liking.Overall, the service staff were courteous, but you can tell they were busy. Understandably so, with a full house the night I was dining there. They managed to keep a smile when serving us, before running off to attend to another guest.Perhaps the only downer of the night was the Hot & Sour soup. That felt like it came out of a can of instant soup
4
I agree with some of the other people about service, I've been there a bunch of times, and they've honoured my reservation twice, but once gave it away (which was the worst with nine people, they eventually sorted it out though). The food is great, I love this place (the service is slowly getting better), but the food is definitely worth going back for, well the char siew is, the rest is just okay I think
