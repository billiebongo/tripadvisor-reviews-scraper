Food was basic and service was lacking. We had to wait quite a while for our pancakes and it came without our toppings. We had to wait almost 10 mins for our toppings while the fan blew our food cold.
3
Visited as a group of 4 after reading its review. Pancakes are ok but space was tight. Not comfy for a sit down breakfast and the outside of the place is not particularly clean.
4
Strictly pancakes does live up to its name! My son and I customized our pancakes and enjoyed ourselves. Unlike others who found the service lacking, we found it totally acceptable. Will come back to try other pancakes.
4
Still the best place to get pancakes! Service was good and food was served quite fast. They should add more chairs for guests
5
We ordered chocolate pancake with chocolate icecream, super delicious! Service was good too, very attentive waiters.
4
Yummy fluffy pancakes, had ordered the savoury ones this time round and definitely will be back for their sweet ones :)
3
Cosy place to hang out with friends. Good for pancake fans but the food is average. Service is prompt.
4
Visited on a Saturday afternoon. We opted for the medium stack with mushrooms and scrambled eggs. I must say the portions sizes for the add ons were pretty good and worth the cost. Pancakes were nice and fluffy - thought I won't say they were the best I've ever had. Only other slight downside was that the cafe was not easy to find.
4
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢d say the pancakes are actually quite good, and the chicken cordon Bleu I had with it was actually not bad. However service was rather slow. We were the only ones there at the time but it took about 20 min to arrive. But the food was good enough I would not mind coming back again to try some more
5
My wife and I ate here for dinner one night. She ordered the stuffed nutella pancakes. They did not disappoint! I ordered the triple stack of pancakes which were also very delicious. Note that this restaurant is tucked away from the street amongst other shops. The inside offers limited seating, but the outside offers plentiful seating. Recommend
4
We were there on Saturday morning. They serve nice pancakes at reasonable price. The couch area on level 2 was too hot.
4
Very interesting range of pancakes from savoury to sweet. We had the druggie (all chocolate!) , and the smores (with giant marshmallows). Loved both. Food was great overall. Decor simple. top floor aircon was quite weak.
4
Excellent service and pancake options available. The place itself is in a small two-storey shophouse and seats might be limited. Go-to place whenever I have a craving for pancakes for dinner.
4
Ordered the savoury garlic prawns & sweet peanut butter/nutella pancakes, they were tasty & pancakes were fluffy. Service crew were attentive & friendly. Will definitely visit again.
5
The last time I came to Strictly Pancakes was ~ in 2012. Had the garlic buttered prawns back then and had it again when I re-visited - it was still heavenly. #MUSTTRY
3
Suitable if you're eating in small groups wanting a quiet ambience.
Level 1 was not air conditioned, level 2 was.
Currently under abit of renovation, but non-disruptive to dining experience.
4
My wife got the savoury - Porker Pancake special.
I got the sweet - Nutella and Peanut Butter (What-a-Spread).... and we swapped plates 1/2 way through.
Both meals were done well and tasted great...
4
Love the garlic butter prawns the best out of all the pancakes I've tried. Friendly staff also! Waiting time abit long though..
5
Food was generously portioned with reasonable rates. Staff was hospitable and very friendly. Place was also easy to find. I'll definitely be back!
4
During my time in Singapore I visited Strictly Pancakes twice. The first time I had the traditional 3 stack of pancakes with eggs and mushrooms. As another reviewer pointed out, the butter is delivered in a hardened/cool state and the pancakes weren't piping hot, so it took some mashing and patience to get the butter melted on the pancakes. Once on though, the pancakes with butter and maple syrup were great. I enjoyed the eggs (scrambled) as well, and the mushrooms weren't bad.The second time around I had the sweet s'mores pancakes ... YUMMY!!! I would have had them the first time around, but the fancy pancakes aren't offered until noon and we were there around 10 am. If you have a sweet tooth, I highly suggest waiting until the afternoon to visit so you can indulge in the deliciousness that the s'mores pancakes offer!Staff were extremely friendly and were easy to get a hold of if you needed something. I was by myself and didn't feel rushed or feel like they were trying to get me out of the door.As a North American, I appreciate having sweet pancakes for breakfast in Singapore! I would recommend dropping into this place for a good portioned breakfast/lunch for a good price
5
They serves fantastic pancakes, Savoury and sweet ones. So good, that I'm coming back again on the following week with another friend!
5
Love the consistency of quality. Customizable pancake choice is a hit with the kids! Will definitely be back for more :)
4
Its a great place that one should definitely visit. The pancakes were good n tasty....
Especially the Garlic Prawn Pancake was aweessoommeee... Milkshakes were good too..The staffs are really lovely people.. Had a very nice time with friends...
4
Nice place for a decent meal. Visited on good Friday public holiday for a late breakfast with family. Menu is simple but appealing. Service is good and staff are friendly. Enjoyed the pancakes with sausages on the side. Coffee was good
5
Visiting from the US and wanting a taste of something from back home, tried this place and it was really good. A great variety of pancakes both sweet and not. Great prices too. We have eaten here twice now and will again before we leave.
3
The food rather average while the portion generous. The prawns kind of tiny though. Coffee wasn't good. Too diluted. Friendly staff.
1
My review After our latest visit the only good thing they can do is to shut down The restaurant üëéüèª
5
Now, I always preferred pancakes to waffles. 2 of the greatest breakfast foods of all-time. Of all-time. But anyhoo, sticking to pancakes, this one takes the cake for #1 overall. I don't really know too many pancake joints in Singapore but you can't argue the goodness of this one. Always a popular hotspot for people from all walks of life, this is a MUST-TRY for everyone who loves a little bit of sinful indulgence every once in a while. Woo
4
The coffee is great and the pancakes are too. I had savoury pancakes with eggs and mushroom while my partner had sweet pancakes with banana. We both loved our meals and while we paid a little more than the average price for food in this area, it was well worth it and was still not expensive given the total cost was $15 each for pancakes and a drink
4
Not a lot of pancake speciality shops around and this place does it quite well. The pancakes are good. The place provides lots of privacy and it is a little quiet hideaway in the city for a chat. The only down side is the pace is not busy but the wait on the food was far too long.
1
Waited a whole 1 hour for our food, missed breakfast cut off by 1 minute and weren't willing to still serve, poor service and staff were very rude. Avoid!!!!
5
I loved the garlic shrimp and pork honey pancakes! I never thought pancakes would go well with meat and seafood for Breakfast brunch lunch or dinner!
4
Really nice pancakes, well made and really tasty. Would have given it 5 stars but service was quite slow. Lovely meal on the whole!
4
The pancakes are good, coffee is very good. Ambiance was homely and cozy. Staff was friendly and I recommend this place for late lazy breakfast.
5
Food here is awesome! I tried "Garlic Butter Prawn" the cream sauce is very nice and the pancake itself very fluffy and soft. It is not like other dry pancakes that I've tried before. Another dish that I ordered is "When bacon met Nutella" it is a WOWWW
4
Tried this place solo, as a couple, with friends as well as with my family. Pretty awesome place. Not too far off from the nearest mall. A good 10 minutes from the MRT station though. I do like their pancakes! They have their specials, categorized into savory, sweets and the basic customizable pancakes. Favorite would have to be "black forest", which they have taken off from their menu. If you're adventurous or not a dessert-person, go for savory. Hasn't been too bad. Garlic prawn is their top hit for very obvious (flavorful) reasons. If you want a mix, bacon meets nutella is to die for. Fun food place to try out with a group of people first, so you get to try a range of pancakes. Once that is done, its a great place to chill for a solo lunch.
4
This place serves one of the best pancakes i've ever tried. A little pricey but in my opinion it was worth it. The pancakes are so moist and full of flavour, the scoop of ice cream that come along with the pancake is out of this world!! If you are willing to pay S$15 for a plate of 3 pieces of pancakes, a scoop of ice-cream and fruit toppings then do not miss this place in Singapore
4
As the name suggests, this place is all about pancakes. You have the option of customising your own (choose number of pancakes, toppings, sides), or to go with a good variety of the sweet or savoury pancake sets. Have never tried the savoury ones here, but they did smell great (from other tables). The portions (unless you customise) can be very big, and the sweetness can be overwhelming at times, so do order carefully. The maple syrup is authentically Canadian and the variety of butters is good (do try the rum and raisin butter). I also make it a point to order a scoop of their excellent vanilla ice-cream with my pancakes, so do try. Also, scrambled eggs on the side to change the taste in my mouth from time to time.Another not-to-be-missed item is the chocolate shake. You will not find a thicker nicer shake for this cheap anywhere else.It is not a very big place, and the atmosphere is homely and cosy
4
We ordered one savoury plus on sweet dish here. The pancakes are well made and the texture is great - also the sauces are not some cheap marmelade but made well. Even though everything was good there wasn't a wow factor to it: the dishes menu could be more surprising
4
I do not have a sweet tooth and honestly was just looking for a place to pass time. Even when my boyfriend and I had decided to eat here for lunch, I was a bit hesitant. However, they have a savoury menu, and I ordered a Garlic Buttered Prawn pancakes (S$15), which went beyond my expectations! I have never enjoyed a pancake so much as this one. My boyfriend took The Druggie (S$13), which was filled with chocolate. I didn't try it but it looked good. He usually doesn't eat too much but almost cleanly finished the 3 pancake stack!However, service seemed a little slow and it took us more than 3 tries to order. Go only if you're not in a rush
5
Food was amazing and delicious. Food presentation is nice and the ambiance inside the restaurant was good. Worth the money for the food.
3
First time here and I found the place using tripadvisor. Nothing special but maybe I should've ordered the savoury pancakes. The patrons at the next table had the garlic prawn pancakes and they smelled so good! Nice quiet little place and the staff was friendly.
5
Craving for their pancakes alrdy!
My ideal type of pancakes üòç comes in sweet, savoury and their classic pancakes!
Service was good!

Recommended by friend to visit Strictly Pancake. They have a good selection of pancakes from savory to sweet. Beautiful and attractive pancakes and my children like it a lot.
5
I visited with my girlfriend, we were just passing by and the place caught our attention. It was fairly busy, which is usually a good sign. We ordered the Banana's Scotched and the Strawberries & Co., both were served promptly, with great service. Great value and they hit the spot! Next time I'm in Singapore we'll be going again
5
Had read good reviews before we left, it was less than 5 minus walk from the V Hotel and the food was fantastic.My youngest daughter LOVES pancakes, we had 4 different sorts of pancakes. choice savoury or sweet and then how many 2,3 or 4 and they are cooked and served beautifully. Only a small place so maybe book or may have to wait, but its worth i
5
The pancakes here are really really good! The ambience at the restaurant is amazing. They have lots of variety and options available. There maple syrup is brilliant. Personally I believe the garlic prawn and herb chicken pancakes are the best. Been here multiple times and look forward to visiting it many more times
5
Best pancakes on this island! Would definitely recommend this cosy corner to anyone and everyone. Excellent service with an eye for detail. Been here a couple of times and the pancakes n staff never fail to satisfy. Awesome garlic prawn pancakes with authentic maple syrup imported from Canada (I was told) . Rum and raisin butter was super delicious as well.. Overall 5 stars, Keep it up 
3
The pancakes were very good, and I thought that they were nice and flavorful, but the service was just okay. Our waiter could barely be heard, and he seemed that he didn't care about us being there. I got strawberries on my pancakes, and they didn't come, so I asked for some on the side, and the waiter rolled his eyes at me. The food took a long time to come as well. I thought the food was good, but service could have been better
2
Some times I crave for pancakes and this is a nice place to have just that. I find the dough well battered and pancakes are smooth and little bit tangy, I like the lemon touch on them. This time went to the Siglap branch and got there little bit late, around 3pm. And were constantly reminded that the kitchen closes at 3.30; almost every time a waiter spoke to us was to hurry us up. Made me feel like if they were milking me; they didn't say it out loud, but message was clear: "we want your money but you are now just such a pain-in-the-neck; go away the sooner the bwtter".
4
Great friendly staff and good food was impressed when I ordered my meal after ordering a coffee the waiter suggested I use my free drink and upsize rather than give me two drinks. Nice when the staff are switched on.
4
Went for a Sunday breakfast with our 3y old kid.
The pancakes are really good, on of the bests I've tried in Singapore.
Service is nice
4
The Druggie was just W.O.W. Period. Full Stop.Full stop to your life coz it's as if you died and went to heaven. Went to heaven to swim in rivers of chocolate. And then you hope that you don't become fat by eating all of that.But hey, since you're in heaven, calories don't matter. ( Diclaimer: This review is written 10 months after my visit to Strictly Pancakes. Clearly, the effects of The Druggie is still very much potent.
3
I came here after reading the good reviews. The menu has great combinations and selections for a pancake house. Loved the attentiveness of the staff. I had the medium stack of plain pancakes with scrambled eggs and a vanilla milkshake. Taste of food was average, the milkshake was awesome. Wouldn't mind coming back to give it another try but not so keen
4
Been craving for pancakes for weeks. Hence my husband and I head down to strictly pancakes in one of the weekend for lunch. We ordered one savory and one sweet pancakes for sharing. We were both glad that we chose the garlic prawn pancake. It is unique. I never knew that garlic, prawns and pancakes are best friends!!! I wouldn't have thought to place them together. But strictly pancake did. And it taste awesome!!! They are very generous of their garlic sauce. It basically covered all 2 slices of pancakes. We finished everything while it is served warm and we both loved it. Next, for the sweet pancake, we ordered "what a spread". It came with peanut butter pancake and peanut butter sauce. It taste quite nice too if you have a sweet tooth. I love both pancakes treat that we ordered and both fully satisfied my cravings :) Oh ya. They have great milkshake and sweet potato fries too!! Do reserve if possible as this caf√© is really quite small and have very limited seating. This is my first visit and I believe that I will be back again for more pancakes :
4
Only in Singapore for a few days, but after spending the last 3 months in Africa, being in a more westernised city for a minute was a welcome change; and Strictly Pancakes was the perfect American style breakfast! The pancakes were fluffy and thick, topped off with real maple syrup. Delicious
4
Not the usual pancakes as you can tell the quality of ingredients is high. Service is average, some young boys and girls sometimes seem a bit lost and late on orders. Price is high as 10‚Ç¨ fo a pancake dish seems quite high but I must admit this is not the usual McDonald pancake stuff..... Try it, it's nice
5
When we were seated in the rather intimate upstairs dining room at Strictly Pancakes, the last thing we expected was a fascinating insight into Singaporean society. Whilst trying very hard not to overhear what was going on around us, we were privy to some rather culturally fascinating personalities, opinions... and rants! This is a popular spot for young, well-heeled locals... not a tourist in sight.Pancakes themselves were decadent and delicious -- chose the lemon curd and tiramisu options. Washed them down with a lovely frothy hazelnut latte and a creamy nutella milkshake.Keen to return and try their savoury options
5
Strictly pancake truly for pancake lovers, I had never seen pancake that they made so creative. From savory to sweet. This is the first time I had my pancake savory. But with the maple and butter both sweet and savory blend with a taste I called 'heaven' . I ordered a egg Benedict from their breakfast, pancake with turkey ham topped with poach egg, side with hollandaise sauce, asparagus, rocket salad and tomatoes. Yes the waiting time was long, but worth for waiting and the queue especially on weekends. Really like their pancake.Do arrive early to avoid long waiting time
4
Went today speciak wanting to try their galic buttered prawns and their sweet pancakes. Anw. Not the first time there. So. We know that we have to make our way there early so as to get a seat. It opens at 1000 on a sunday as what the website has said. But. It was not stated that it only serves breakfast. So. Ended up when I reached. I was told that only the breakfast is served when I have alre finished looking at the menu and getting ready to order. Overall. The food was still good. Serving was huge. Felt really bloated after finishing. Breakfast sets comes with a free drink. Service was soso. We got ourselves seated. But the place was a little warm. Staff was seen having soft drinks at public areas.
4
staff were friendly and nice, pancake taste usual lot of people as usual too awhile before i got a seat, food could have taste better
4
The pancakes here are very delicious. Especially the chocolate pancakes. But note that most of the dishes are only available after 12:00pm. The waiters were not that customer friendly and I thought that they could have served us better.
4
We ordered the chocolate and strawberry pancakes here.The chocolate pancakes was quite huge with a choco syrup and slices of strawberries while the strawberry pancakes comes with white cream, strawberry jam and slices of strawberries and blackberries.I prefer the chocolate one, although we have to share with friends to finish it because it's huge.I wish their pancakes more crispy on the outside and fluffy in the inside, then it would be perfect.The chocolate is very chocolaty, and absolutely for the choco lover, while the strawberry i feel it's just a standard one.Service quite good, and they serve ice water. The place also quite convenient. A place that you can have a chit chat with friends while enjoying the pancakes together
4
Popped by strictly pancakes for an early dinner. Ordered a medium serve (3 pancakes) with add on sides of scrambled eggs, mushrooms, chipolata and bacon. Great bacon but can't say the same for the rest of the sides which were pretty average. Pancakes of course was good, fluffy and tastes great. Another order was the Bananas-Scotched which was awesome. Pancakes with vanilla ice cream, caramelised bananas and drizzled with a rum and maple syrup concoction. Must try this. Service wasn't impressive but it's a place that's of great value (we spent approx 33sgd in total) and definitely worth a visit
3
Staff were efficient and professional, although not mind-blowingly awesome. Pancakes were okay. We ordered pancakes with mushrooms, bacon, chipolatas and while the pancakes were your run-of-the-mill ones, the bacon I got was not crispy while the mushrooms were just soggy and tasteless. Butter was too hard to be spread on the pancakes (should've been at room temperature when served)... All in all, not a terrible experience, but certainly room for improvement
2
The pancakes were not fantastic, I believe many Singaporeans visit this restaurant not sure why.Its a small place, and the attitude of the staff is "eat and leave" as I said in my heading, there were no smiles from the staff, place gets a thumbs down from me. Irony is they have a Tripadvisor sticker at the till point. Well here's your review Strictly Pancakely Poor.
1
We went there with my girlfriend on Sunday, in a good mood for pancakes.It was drizzling outside but they have big umbrellas so we thought we could have eaten easily outdoor. I asked if it was possible and the answer was "no because we are full inside, so if it rains harder we cannot find you a seat inside". Knowing that it can rain at anytime in Singapore, I find this reason quite strange, but ok, we go inside.We had to wait in line as the place was full, and as we were told the waiting time was about 20 min, I asked if we could just sit on their outdoor chairs while we wait, so our time would be more pleasant. The girl replied that only one of us could sit but that we "could take turns so at least one of us remains in the line"! Hahahaha! It is the first time I hear such a nonsense from a restaurant.What kind of restaurant doesn't let their customers sit down knowing that they will have to wait for more than 20 min?!Anyway, we finally step in. The room is cold and noisy. We order 3 pancakes with mushrooms and bacon. The bacon was good, the pancakes were bland, and the mushrooms looked and tasted like they just came out of the tin... Terrible!Add that their "orange juice" is a great chemical Minute Maid, and you have the worst place I have been in a very long time.At least the damage was only 20$, but it was a waste of time and good mood.There are so many good pancake places, I would recommend to strictly never go there
4
we ordered garlic buttered prawns, chicken ala king and potatoes leeking cheese pancakes and they were all great! price is reasonable. the staff were attentive enough so i have no complaints except that we went their Monday lunch time and they were closed, opening by 6PM on that day. Ambiance is ok, diner type. Not sure if this is a regular thing but better double check or call them before adding them on your itinerary
4
Servers weren't smiley nor very helpful/friendly, you need to ask and wave them over for everything. Considering that one pays service tax and how small the place is, they really need to improve their smiles and being attentive - simple things like topping up waters/offering a takeaway cup/plate. Just based on the food then, it's reasonably priced considering how filling they are. I thought a medium stack (3 pancakes) wouldn't be enough to fill me but I was full by the time I ate 3/4 of my plate, and had to takeaway half of my milkshake too. I highly recommend the milkshakes if you like them thick and creamy (think MacDonald's milkshake texture).My sister recommends the Tiramisu and Blackforest pancakes having tried them before. My brother enjoyed their savoury choices. Wireless is provided, password stuck to the tables

This is my first complain ever. The service was terrible. Waitress had her eyes rolled to top while we decided what to order. I was wondering why she didn't even give us time to go through the menu. When food were served, she made an effort to bang them on the table. Well, we brushed it off as an accident but it left a sour taste throughout the meal. After we finished our meal, they're prompt to clean up the place while we're still seated, we asked if they could spare us some paper napkin we were told to wait, this time from a waiter and similarly, with the most sulky face resemblance to his colleague. True enough, we never received those napkins. And at last before we left my friend took the 'courage' to ask the waiter to help us with photoshoot and his reply was 'quickly please'. Hmm.. What a huge turn off
