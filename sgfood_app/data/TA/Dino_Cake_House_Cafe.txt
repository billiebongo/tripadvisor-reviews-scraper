As a bakery, Dino offers very fine cheesecakes and pineapple tarts. As a cafe, it offers mouth-watering laksa and lontong.

My family had lunch here and we liked the food a lot. Chicken curry with rice or bread was the daily special and I had it with rice... it was great! My wife and daughter had the fried bee hoon and fried rice respectively and both were good. Yummy local delights served in air-conditioned comfort... what more can you ask for?

We had a good time celebrating her birthday much to her surprise.One of my favourite place for cakes n the local hawker fare is very good too.Been coming to this hide out from day 1. It has always been a good place, nothing flashy but good food reasonably priced n service with a smile.We will be back

We have been coming here for the longest time for simple fare that tastes like food we get at home. Our favourites are the mee siam and the fried bee hoon although the claypot laksa and lontong are also good. The food is not oily and not over spicy. They have their own not-so-spicy and also not oily sambal that you can have with the mee siam and the fried beehoon and fried rice. The prices are reasonable although the portions are rather small. The cakes and pastries are also very good with my personal favourites being the coconut slice and the fresh cream puffs. As the cafe is along Upper Thomson Road and not a tourist area, I would assume it is mostly patronized by the people living around the area or by people like me who have been bringing friends to the cafe for many years. However, parking can be a problem and many times we have had to give the place a miss because of this. If you are a tourist with time on your hands, Dino Cafe is about 10 to 15 minutes away from MacRitchie Reservoir and the Tree-Top Walk and near Thomson Plaza. The coffee shop next to Dino sells Kampong (Farm) Chicken rice and there are other small restaurants nearby but do not miss coffee and dessert at Dino
