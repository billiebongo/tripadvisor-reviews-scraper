It’s a major recommended restaurant, we had the raclette and it was very delicious at such a cheap price also. The place is nice and clean with very nice staff

After a long flight, we visited this restaurant for something to eat. We were impressed by the selection and by the customer care and attention. We returned several times, lunch and dinner, during our stay in Singapore.
5
Awesome service and good value for money. Its a good place to chill with family and friends. Just shout out to Prem!!
5
Fantabulous place!!! After a Long day at work best place to dine and chill out.. best customer service and great wine in town!!!

Outstanding! The whole "experience" was amazing and the food was divine. They slowly melt a huge block of cheese on your table and you incorporate this melted goodness along with your bread, meat and vegetables.

My friends and I were there for Raclette and it was not a bad experience despite the heat and the lack in comfort of the bar stools and small table. Most of the staff was able to help us out very well except a bald Indian employee who might be in a supervisory position was very rude to us from the onset.We reserved a table for Raclette and when we approached one of the staff, he went to ask this arrogant employee to attend to us. He walked out with a scowl on his face glaring at us and asked rudely about what he can help us with with no ounce of politeness at all. I mentioned that I'd reserved a table and his face turned into one of suspicion as though we were trying to dupe him into giving us a table. Soon after he realise his mistake, he told someone else to bring us to our seats. When we were leaving, he gave his death glare at us again and said nothing.Seriously, spending money on such an establishment is fine, the wines are reasonably priced and most of the staff are great. The heat is something to complain about but all of those wouldn't be as bad as that bald Indian employee

I can only echo the review of Matieu from October 2017. As a regular patron (and fan!) of Wine Connection for the past several years I have also noticed this unfortunate drop in standards, which is even more prominent with delivery orders. As well as having a minimum of 5 items (for a higher price) the portions of the cheese platter are tiny and not of good quality. Last order was so bad that by the time I had cut the stale edges from the cheeses there were mere morsels left. Sad times
5
There are two of them, I prefer to sit at the counter, have a nice glass of wine and taste some of their cheese and charcuterie selection. Staff is engaging and efficient enough price is super reasonable and the sort of place you go with a long standing friend to have a nice talk and meaningful evening. The wine connection that is the bigger one is also good and suited for groups of friends and families. The menu is well done and tapa style food is certainly a nice compliment to the wine. Actually the food is so decent that you do not always need to order wine and can just have one of their creative mocktails/juices and enjoy a nice lunch. Will go back. The one in VIVO is also very nice and well ru

We’ve been there for more than 2 years now, almost every month or two.But since few months we can clearly notice a step back on food quality ( very old raclette cheese, rotten salad) and poor service ( sometime rude waiters or waitress)It’s sad because it use to be so perfect, friendly staff and delicious food.Hope it’s just temporary..

Took my mum to the wine connection cheese bar at robertson for a raclette lunch. Ordered two sets and it was just nice for 3 people. The server (cant remember who, was a lady) however did not have good product knowledge at all. I asked for a wine recommendation to pair with the raclette and her reply was "my preference is different from yours so i cant really recommend". What?? At a wine bar? Strange! Perhaps some kind of training is needed.In all, good food, mediocore service.
5
Quite nice bar on Robertson Walks with a solid wine and cheese selection. Good place to start the night.
5
At This place we had cheese raclette, it really was a new dinning experiance - you should try it. People's was really Nice. We had a botle of red Wine AS Well.
4
Every time in Singapore we come here at least once. Cheese plates with a plethora of choices, and interesting wines. Wines are some of the best value in Singapore. A good pour at a pretty good price. Staff are very nice, friendly and attentive. Very good prices on buying cheese to take back to hotel. Coolers full of some of my favorite stinkies

Had been there today for dinner to celebrate advance birthday meal for my daughter. Ordered the raclette set and was served without the mixed salad although it was stated in their menu and advert board. Told the service staff and nothing was done and not even a sorry. I was thinking maybe they run out of vege for salad and continue with our meal. After finishing the meal and I asked for the check. It took a whole 15 minutes for them to process the receipt. While waiting for my receipt, I saw the next table ordered the raclette set and they were served with mixed vegetable salad. I started to look around and saw other tables that ordered raclette set was given a mixed salad.I was wondering is it because I am local and the next table sits a Caucasian that is why he and his partner was served with mixed salad.Is this the way businesses is being conducted? Feeling lousy.
4
A friend too me here and asked for a table of 3, the waitress asked us out to wait (while the restaurant was 80% empty). Then initially we got a table of 4, but along the way she kept asking us to change table if our friend is not coming. Then finally she moved us, but didn't even move our wine and left it there. Very arrogant service. But honestly speaking the food/cheese is pretty good
5
Lovely and quiet setting to relax on a Sunday afternoon enjoying good cheese and sipping a wine. Reasonably priced and good selection of cheese (50g serves). We had Beef Pastrami accompanied with four cheeses (Brillat Savarin Gorgonzola Igor Livarot and Roquefort) washed down with a bottle of Wolfberger Pinot Gri

Really enjoyed our dinner here last week. They have a decent selection of cheeses (mainly mainstream and a few less common ones) and a large range of wines in different price points. As with the other Wine Connections the wines are a lot cheaper than other Singapore restaurants but the food quality in this place is better than in the other Wine Connections. You pay a bit more but it's worth it.The tartines are priced at $20 and are fairly large. One portion would be sufficient for two people in combination with a cheese board and a salad for example. We didn't try the raclette as we felt it was overpriced at $42 per person with minimum order of 2 people. The service we had from all staff was very good.Including wine you'll likely pay between $40 and $80 per person. We'll definitely be back

If you like wines and need a place to hang out with friends, this is it! Awesome variety of wines from all over the world at prices that won't burn a hole in your pocket... ambience is good too... tapas offering can improve but I will still go back... spirits choice is limited (cause it's a wine place I Guess) and priced on the higher sid
1
We wanted, my friend and I, to eat a raclette at a reasonable price. Ahah, 72 dollars gone because the waiters put 2 raclettes in one without saying anything. A small glass of wine almost empty at 16 dollars. Ridiculous!
4
A big thank you to the staff of this lovely place, and especially to the lovely supervisor of the wine connection cheese bar - Mr Prem. Despite being away for 6 months, he still remembered me and we had a good conversation.He's knowledgable and very approachable, always smiling and ready to assist me with my needs.If you are looking for a place to chill and enjoy some good wine, accompanied with a good cheese platter I definitely recommend this place!!!☺
5
Delightful food, ambiance and a great wine selection at your fingertips makes this place a must visit when in Singapore. Well priced for amazing food and great wine and good service.
4
Nothing else than enjoying the Wine and Cheese Platter, while having a chat with some friends here, it just simply relaxing.
4
It's a nice place to hanging around with friends. The location is ideal n around wt lots of restaurants n other drinking places.

Try wine & cheese and also tapas bar
Best sausages and beers
I tried it in Singapore unity street.
don't forget to reserve for best sit.
happy hour for only 18$ a main course and a salad or soup

We have been regular guests to this restaurant for cheese & wine supper in the past. We tried to go again yesterday (saturday night) and were denied indoor seating at 23h15 despite a 2am closing time and at a time when the indoor seating was busy with 70-80% of the tables occupied so we were clearly not alone, and there was space to sit...Instead we were told to sit outside - which we really do not like because of the heat and the humidity.We tried to explain to the staff that we are fast eaters and would be out before the other guests, but were told that "everybody had already asked for their bill and was finishing up so they were closing down that section." (Author's note - I am just repeating what I was told)Given that sitting outside in the heat is not pleasant and because we do not want to argue and make a scene, we took our business somewhere else. After our dinner (which was nice), we passed by the restaurant at 12h15 (when we walked back to our car) and it was still crowded indoors. Obviously, they could have easily accommodated us - I guess the people that had asked for their bills more than an hour earlier were lingering longer than expected...Anyway, don't get me wrong, Restaurants can absolutely refuse to accept guests, I do not pretend to be a VIP, neither do I think we deserve to be rejected either because I happen to believe that we are very unremarkable guests that do not bother anyone and are respectful, pay our bills and appreciate the food.This being said, I am writing this review for two reasons - One, because I really do not like to be treated like this and secondly because I am just not sure that the owners are aware that their staff is actively managing down their workload which is costing them revenues. As a owner of several businesses, this is a point that I feel very strongly about.I am sorry to say that you have lost us as customers - your restaurant was quite nice, but we deserve a minimum of respect and politeness...So in summary - two stars because the food used to be nice and I have no reason to believe that that has changed, but highly negative marks for unfriendly staff who refuse to allow you to sit inside even when we asked very politely, when there was space and when it was 2.5 hours before closing time. As a special favour - if the management of the restaurant reads this, please do something about your business instead of writing me one of these dishonest "thank you for your feedback" notes. If you accept this behaviour from your staff you will very soon not have a business anymore. The choice is yours

Food was average, air conditioning didn't cope with the the the humidity too well. Staff kept hovering. Won't return
4
You can't fault the cheese. I've been living somewhere you can't get French cheese and I forgot how good they are. 3 cheeses come with bread and fruit so you could get a decent meal for $19. Plus a big range of wines. Service tries to be snootily efficient but isn't very good - sometimes you have to shout to get their attention, which is unseemly in a place like this
4
We first saw this bar on a Friday night - it was buzzing and had a great atmosphere. We called in the next day for a quick lunch. The service was very slow..... in fact we had to ask 3 times for a drink and then chase up to order the food. This aside the goats cheese salad was excellent, as was the Riesling its was paired with. We saw lots of delicious looking sharing boards going out of the kitchen along with a fondue. Overall I'd suggest going here if you're in the area, best in the evening when there's plenty of staff and a great atmosphere
4
We always come to this place very often, always enjoy the service, on this day, a Saturaday evening, we didnt make reservation and wanted wine and cheese impromptu. Understand that its crowded, we saw an empty space with laptop and papers on the bar counter near facing the cashier, able to accomodate for 2, though it was just nice for us and as the lady at the counter that we are ok to seat, drink and wait for the person beside to finish at the bar counter. Immediately the reply from her was... NO! No more seats available. Shocked by her reply I pointed the area with laptop and papers on the counter, she said no. Lucky another staff, in black shirt and pant (regarding not knowing his name) I told him we are ok to wait and order our drinks first while waiting for the person at the bar counter to finish she had finish, billed jus sitting there looking at her phone. This wonderful staff deserved to be recommended, he replied, no problems jus let me clear away the laptop and papers. this place still never disappoints me, the service is still excellent, thank you for getting us a seat with quick response
5
I love all cheeses and raclette cheese is one of my favourites. This restaurant does a mean raclette set that comes with bread cornichons and everything. It was quite good value and especially since we were given a table right in the cheese room itself. Fabulous fabulous choice
3
Would usually move to the Cheese bar if the Tapas bar nearby is full. As with the Tapas bar, the wines here are relatively cheap. Good selection of cheese. Recommend the raclette cheese.
5
Popped in one afternoon for a quick glass as only round the corner from our hotel the have a good choice of wine with various prices also a great selection of cheese from all parts of the world a great visit
5
An excellent place for a wind down weekend meal and very reasonably priced wine of great quality. The ambience is good. I perfer outside but you can enjoy aircon as well.
4
I have been here a couple of times now in the past few weeks and I must say I totally enjoy the place. There are many different ways to select your cheese, but my favourite is to get a couple of cheese and meat selections. The cheese goes from the normal cheddar type, through the soft cheese up to a good selection of blue. Mind be careful as some are certainly smelly. Add to this the selection of wine from the shop / bar next door and your in for a great hour or more. Just one word of advice, it gets busy so get there earl
4
I visited twice in one day, for lunch and dinner. The wines were the cheapest that I'd seen at any restaurant in Singapore with good New Zealand Marlborough Sauvignon Blanc ranging from $35- $40. This was less than half the price charged by other mid range restaurants. The lunch range is good and reasonable with an average price of $19 and a daily special of $19 for a set lunch.For dinner I tasted the excellent cheeses and this is something I would recommend if cheese is your thing.The only slight negative is the average service which was the same for both of my visits. The staff are not welcoming, engaging or attentive enough to the customers. This dilutes the experience and is something which prevented a 5 star award from me.
5
This little wine bar has a huge collection of wines at exceptionally good prices. Many bottles starting around the S$30 mark (about Â£17) and terrific cheese list. We went for a bottle of Valpolicella Ripasso, excellent value at S$41.House specialty is raclette - a type of melted cheese fondue. This was widely ordered and seemed to be going down well. Joe and Fizz went for the cheese board, selecting 5 cheeses from an impressive list of European cheeses. All 5 of our selection were delicious. Nicely soft Brie de Meaux particularly worthy of praise. Friendly and helpful service from Yumi. We're going back tonigh
3
Ordered a bottle of wine for myself. The wine itself was great. However, the service wasn't as good. But am I supposed to pour the wine to my own glass when the glass is empty? I don't think so. My glass was empty for quite a while, and there were staffs standing in front of me, or were walking pass me, but they didn't seem to care. It was around 15 minutes later when a staff coming from the other side of the outlet came to pour for me, instead of the staff standing in front of me. And another thing, although I didn't order any food, I didn't think that the staff there bother about hygiene. It is food and beverage, but the ladies staff there aren't tying their hair. What if their hair fliea to the food. Where is the hygiene level there
5
We were very impressed with the cheese plate we ordered, very good quality from various regions. Red wine was delicious and served at the correct temperature, despite the searing heat.Staff were friendly, some a little strange though.Definitely recommend this place
4
Sitting outside here is a bit strange; at the roadside on the side walk. However, this is more than made up for by the excellent, and well priced, wine selection, but especially by the cheeses and tapas. The bread is perfect, the cheese soft, stinky and running; heaven
4
We love going there each time we visit Singapore. Usually choose a bottle from the boutique and then ordered a few cheeses to eat it with. Reasonable prices
5
We were craving a bit of cheese on our trip and this restaurant did not disappoint - the waiter was super helpful and recommended us a great soft cheese, delicious!
5
Have very good selection of wine and cheese, very relaxed and fun environment makes it comfortable for the customers to blend in and have a good time.
5
We were heading for Wine Connection Tapas bar but stopped at the Cheese bar in error. Never mind!!! We really enjoyed the ambience, food and wine. A lovely way to spend Friday evening 😄
3
Food was great but the servers were not very attentive. It was our first time there with no experience and we didn't really know what to do.
5
I stumbled across this on trip adviser and as it was so close we hand to go and try it! It's an incredible place!! We had the raclette and we totally devoured it! The cheese melts within a few seconds. It comes with a selection of lovely cured meats, boiled potatoes, bread, pickles and a green salad. Just sensational! We had a lovely bottler of red at a really reasonable price! We strolled over bit if ur a bit further out then it's just a few minutes from Clarke Quay.Highly recommend!!
4
Brought a visiting friend for wine and light meal. The services improved since last visit. Great friendly and accommodating service staff. 2 girls I didn't catch their name. Good wine and food. The Caucasian believed to be the Manager really needs some re-training in attending to diners. Gloomy look around 5pm on a Thursday
3
Wine connection in Robertson quay is a good place to hang out with friends for a casual dinner with WinePrices are ok and food pretty Nice I was a little disappointed by the cheese St Nectaire was not so great and paying for extra bread à Lille harsh but the Rose was nice and fruity and good value.Serving was decent but a little noisy and some table are really in the way so you eat in the traffic or next to the cars.Need to go back to try the Raclette
4
We sat at a high table as a group of six and very much enjoyed the selections of cheeses and charcuterie boards as well as the wines we tried. The atmosphere is relaxed and stylishly casual and the staff was welcoming and attentive. We were there around 6-7pm on a week night and were surprised that the place was not busier.Cost was reasonable. Definitely a place to visit again
4
I visited here when I was in Singapore visiting my best friend and the food was great. This was the first time I had tried Raclette and I fell in love - who doesn't like melted cheese with meat and potatoes etc? If you are vegan, this place probably isn't for you. Wine was a great price here as well, the service was good but not fantastic. I would definitely go back. The creme brûlée was also very good
5
We came here for lunch on our way back to our hotel. Great selection of cheese and wines as well as other dishes. Such a good idea for a group eating, sharing platters! Loved it. We came back again in a few nights. Service was quick, different things on the menu to try were all lovely. Quality and price were very reasonable
5
Great collection of wine and cheese
Amazing atmosphere and great service got by black dragon lady , recommended
5
Affordable wines, amazing cheese platters and great service. Best place to spend an evening.
Btw, Black Dragon is da bomb!
5
If you don't come for food you come for black dragon ! It is quiet an experiment ! Inexpensive and good quality of food.. we love it here
5
Great service by veteran staff Christine! Especially the cheese and Apple chips. Are hear last year with friends. We will come back!
5
Walked in expecting a common experience but was blown away by the quality food and sevice....
Our server black dragon deserves special mention for her attention and expertise
5
Such good service! Thanks black dragon. Such good cheeses and warm bread makes it taste amazing. Definitely be back
5
Chris is very kind, obliging and keen to serve and clearly very passionate of her job. Look out for her!
5
Black dragon is the best ! Excellent service!!! I will come back every week !!! Affordable drinks and good ambience... always a great time at wine connection !!!
5
Well located nice set up great choice of wine and cheese.we took the cheese platter great to be able to pick the cheese we like. Good size and decent price for Singapore The large choice of wine at every price makes it one of the best spot in town
4
Chris was really nice and serve us with talent! She is always smiling and taking care of us!Definitely recommended
5
Great raclette with great staff, look out for Chris! We had a wonderful raclette meal with great service!
5
Wine selection excellent, quite overwhelming really. Hard to choose really. A little expensive but hey we were on holidays.
4
Stopped in for a cheese platter & glass of wine, plenty of other options on menu to tempt. Plenty cheese option to choose from (takeway available).
5
Wine connection cheese bar is a guarantee for good times with good wine and fantastic service. Especially Chris Black Dragon shines with her expertise and friendly advice when it comes to selecting the right wine. We'll be back :
5
We had a great dinner and wine at Wine Connection. Chris 'Black Dragon' did a great job with our order! This is a gem if you are looking for wine in Singapore which can get quite pricy!
5
We have visited this place several times during our visit to Singapore. Generally we have had a couple of glasses of wine ( great range) and a cheese platter ( outstanding selection). Service is great and the cheese aroma is fabulous. We would recommend and will be back 
5
Came without reservation, but quickly got seated outside. Nice menu and fast friendly service. Had a selection of cold cut meat and hard cheese. All vet delicate. Large selection of wine by the glass, so everyone should be happy - I was.Will come again next time in Singapore
3
The wine is very reasonably priced here and the food is excellent. service is fairly poor in terms of efficiency and attitude. Reminded me of Paris where the waiters sometimes seem to think they are more important than the customer. 4 out of 5 for the food and 1 out of 5 for servic
5
Awesome cheese & wide selection of affordable wines in Singapore. Christine the Legendary Black Dragon is the best in the world!!! Awesome pleasant humorous person ever met! Look for her when you patronize cheesebar. Will get a memorable & unforgettable experience for you
5
The Wine Connection group started out as a wine distributor many years ago, and finally opened up a few sit-down establishments that can be found throughout Singapore. They still operate as a distributor so you'll be spoilt for choice when it comes to bottled wines - in fact, many people do rock up to purchase a bottle for personal consumption at home or with friends, instead of just having them on the spot. This particular Wine Connection is in the heart of expat Singapore, where a quick 10 minute walk brings you to Clarke Quay and River Valley. They have cheeses and other mains to accompany your wine selection too. Prices are reasonable and service is good. It's not hipster, and it's not trying to be anything fancy, so you can really feel comfortable coming here by yourself or with a friend, with a date, family, or colleagues
5
The dinner was really good and the service very pleasant. Especially Christine the black dragon, one of the waitress. She is just amazing. I'll definitely come back to see her and enjoy the cheese.
5
Delicious food, best cheese in town, great wine and very dedicated and sufficient staff. Thank you Chris for taking care of us tonight!!! See you next time!
4
When I come to this restaurant, I take the cheese platter with a lot of choice. The cheese is good and you can eat and drink very well for 30 dollars per person.
5
Good selection of wine and the raclette is a must try. Look out for the superb Chris aka legendary black dragon
5
Superb service from Christine and enjoyed the cheese raclette thoroughly. Will come again with friends. Good for gatherings and wine selection is good as well.
5
Love the manager! Super friendly. Amazing cheese platter and great selection of wines. Will definitely be returning
5
First time here trying the Raclette and it was amazing. Even more with our wonderful and funny waitress Christine the Black Dragon. My boyfriend had been here many times and been singing praises about her and he is right. Kudos Christine. Thank you for being so attentive and funny

Having a cheese raclette with my wife and my young toddler on a quiet Sunday night. I suddenly bit on something hard. I spat the cheese and ham out and I found a 2cm–long piece of broken glass. I was so surprised, maybe shaken, maybe I’m just too calm, I didn’t start screaming. I just called the waitress and told her I had found a piece of broken glass in my mouth. A PIECE OF BROKEN GLASS IN MY MOUTH! She didn’t looked too shocked or worried, or even apologetic. She just said: “let me show it to the chef”. A few minutes later the chef arrived and said pretty casually “it must have been from the cheese pan, we broke some glass nearby yesterday. Let me get my manager”. The manager on duty arrived, didn’t look too worried either. Started clearing the cheese away, without a word, then came back and offered to replace the whole dinner. That's friendly but aren’t we missing the whole point here? I was not complaining about a bad taste or even a hair in my food. I was complaining about a piece of broken glass, that could have killed me, at least sent me to ICU or even worse, injured my child! I was lucky, I’m so lucky! I’m lucky I was the one who found the glass and I’m lucky I didn’t swallow the cheese without chewing because I decided to have that bit with some ham. Anyway as we were close to the end of the dinner, we declined more food apart from more cheese as the almost-but-not-yet-finished cheese was taken away.A few minutes later, still wondering how it could have happened, I asked for the bill. The same waitress who seemed she couldn’t care less just brought the full bill. I gave my credit card. It took quite a few minutes for the bill to be brought back, by the manager, who finally offered an apology for the glass shard, offered me a 25% discount ($31.90!) and asked if I could give my contact details for him to talk to his own manager the next day. I gave my card with my name, e-mail, work phone and mobile phone. One day later, nobody has contacted me…Now that is an amazing casual way to treat clients you have endangered. I spent the night wondering what could have happened, dying on their dining table, or in the ambulance or making it to surgery in horrible pain. I spent the night wondering whether I, or my wife, or my toddler, did swallow any more, smaller pieces of glass that could pierce our stomach or bowels.Now I regret I kept my calm, I guess if an ambulance had been called, the big manager would have been called on the spot, I guess if I had started yelling like mad in the restaurant, I would have received a proper deep apology and not a stupid 25% discount.As I left the restaurant, I walked in front of my waitress. She didn’t say good-bye

This is one of the best hangout for cheese and wine lover (they also serve beer). Raclette is the signature dish which most of the guest would order. It costs your $39/head with min 2 guests. The cheese is nice and it's an good experience. Do make reservation if you are coming with big group as I went on weekdays night with a friend but the tables were full
5
I'm french and amateur of raclette and it is the best I have done so far. Selection of cheese is huge although the raclette is the main thing. Charcuterie is also very good. The wine is excellent and very well priced for Singapore. I would go there every week but this wouldn't be healthy. High recommended 
5
This is an excellent stop off point when walking by the riverside for a glass of reasonably priced wine and also snacks or full lunch/dinner
5
Good place for raclette or cheese. Good food and Very good service. For extra service ask for Chris!!! Always helping you for everything
4
What a very pleasant way to spend an hour or so over a cheese platter and French champagne.
In a busy space but somehow it seemed peaceful. Wonderful selection of cheeses and wines.
Well worth a bit of time.
5
Excellent our fav.. Service by Chris amazing, best wine selection & price in Singapore... Racoulette a hit something different. Young crowd & always busy try & book.
5
Excellent service by Chris. Come find her when you are here. Lots of quality cheese, ham, bread & wine. Good for sharing with family and friends!
5
Second time at Wine Connection Cheese Bar, never regret coming here again and will still be coming here more. Came with my family and had an awesome meal with the Raclette Set ! Will definitely recommend to my friends and family !
5
Raclette was delicious and service was great! Look for Chris! Impeccable service! :) I've been coming back for so many times!
4
Delicious Raclette, generous portions and fun vibes.
The lovely miss Chris (aka black dragon) shines in her role as hostess with the mostess ;)
5
Great place to have raclette with friends, food and drink prices also very reasonable. Excellent service especially from Black Dragon.
5
Great french cheese and wine from everywhere. I recommend the raclette. Go directly to the cheese bar and ask for black dragon, a waitress with a strong character, sush as the cheese!
5
Awesome cheese and wine selection. Service by our waitress "black dragon" is excellent ! A classic and regular favorite
5

Great evening, great service, dragon is a blast, games of thrones is out, winter is coming.... black dragon is flying, cheese is melting, wine is flowing, midgets are dancing, cows are singing, birds are committing and the sun never leaves us.. Amen
5
The food here is amazing, the cheese melts off the hook and the service from the staff is really good as well. I highly recommend it
5
best spot for great value cheese meat and wine in Singapore. 5* for that alone. Extra star bonus if you are lucky enough to have Black Dragon as your waitress she is awesome! :)
4
The wine selections is pretty good, and they have a lovely cheese platter selection (mix and match).Pros:- very friendly staff- good cold cut selections for wine pairing- wide range of cheese (hard, soft, blue, etc)Cons:- though wine prices are reasonable, the food prices are a little on the high sid
4
I was there with my colleagues after work and we had good wines and nice cheeses, a few selection of artisan cheese and some delicious hot finger licking good hot items from the kitchen. Thanks to the chefs and floor staffs that helped recommended us what to have. Appreciate
5
Great ambience. Highly recommended for wine and cheese lover/enthusiasts. We had the raclette melted cheese, tasted heavenly when paired with tender meat that it felt like they just melt in your mouth, bread, potatoes and red wine. Waiting staff were efficient and there's a wide selection of wine to choose from. The only downside is that it took ages for our credit card to come back when we're settling the bill. It took almost 15mins. We'll definitely come back
5
Was our 2nd visit to the cheese bar at Robertson quay , we were very impressed when the assistant manager, Mr Thiru remembered the brand of wine we had the last round.We love the ambience and wide selections of wines, reasonable pricing too.We will definitely return again in the very soon
5
I always look for black dragon and tony. These guys always make my wine dreams come true. The service here is legendary!!!!! The wine & awesome raclette is to die for!!!!!
4
Every night was busy, in a good way. The place to be, it has a great atmosphere. Locals and Tourists seem to frequent here.

My friends who live in Singapore took me on Friday night. Selection of wine and champagne was fantastic. If ppl really like cheese must visit here. Really can enjoy cheese and drinks as much as you can. Decor and atmosphere also chic and comfortable as well. It's really happening place so that ensure make a booking before visiting here. Highly recommend to have a special experience here.

My first visit to wine connection n a very delightful experience. Very gd traditionnel racelette w gd fresh pdts fr France. Gd chablis white n great helpful friendly service fr Chris the blackdragon. She's a cute lively joyous n reactive server. Will definitely come back for the food wines n great service. â˜
5
We love the atmosphere and the great service especially Chris:) good cheese n wine at reasonable prices
5
We went there for my friend's birthday. Good service e great cheeses. Kudos to the manager Daniele for make our night more enjoyable! We will definitely go back!
5
Awesome service and delicious food🧀🍷🍴. I am sure that me and my friends will come again.
The restaurant is a paradise for all cheese lovers.
5
Black Dragon is amazing!! Ask for her. The food and drinks are the best deal in SG. This is the best place in SG for people watching.
5
Typical Singaporean sidewalk place to have an amazing time having great wine, cheese platters, good music, efficient service and good crowd. The one in Unity street has a good location and gets happening in the evenings. Obviously weekends get very crowded so one must have some level of toleration for a little slower service.The only minus would be that the choices of cheese or the platters can get quite a bit confusing if you are not used to wine/cheese bars. They should have some simple off-the-shelf platter/wine combo recommendations ready-to-offer for the lessor minions like us!Oh, the other minus would be that the free wifi was not available throughout the restaurant area
2
Ideal for wine lovers but food and service disappointing. Chef was constantly on his mobile phone . Assistant manager , not sure what she was managing as it was not her team. Food lacked flavour . Offered dessert when main courses still on the table .
4
I was at Wine Connection cheese bar with a group of my friends to celebrate an occasion. The service staff that served us was friendly and had a really nice smile. She even recommended to us various selections of cheese and which wines or beverages might go along well with them. Her name was juvena. The ambience of the restaurant was also good, and the prices was quite attractive. Will definitely recommend!
5
We had a really good night with a lovely and very tasty Raclette and a good Argentinean Malbec.The ambience is nice and very suitable for a couple to enjoy a casual evening together.I'll definitely go there again if I visit Singapore in the near future
5
No doubt this is one of the best wine connection store i ever been. Their staff especially Gary show great wine and cheese knowledge. Able to share his passion with his customers. Today i had Raclette which is good. The cheese were imported from france with great freshness. Finally their manager Thiru is absolutely able to demonstrate what fnb service should be. A true leader, good guy from jb malaysia. I will 100% revisit again my next trip. 5 star.
4
A bit off from Clarke Quay Station. But it is worth visiting. Good selection of cheese and wine. I found price is very reasonable. Epoisses (whole) costs $24 SGD, which is more expensive than the price in France, but it is much cheeper than that in Tokyo. Ordered a plate of three cold cut meet for $19 SGD. It was more than a main for myself. Service staff is friendly and kind. Enjoyed quality of interior. I must try raclette next time
4
The raclette is a big piece of cheese that melts under a heater, the cheese drips on a plate and the melted cheese to be poured over your plate with potato, meat and veggies, its a heavy meal but highly recommended.
5
Came here with my wife as we walked through this area. Decided to settle down with a cheese raclette meal and a nice bottle of Italian wine. Friendly staff who helped us get a table despite having no reservations
4
Very friendly customer service. Interesting concept with great quality ingredients served with a smile. Well done Chris
4
Great place for your evening drinks and food. We were served by Chris aka Black Dragon. She was attentive and awesome. She recommended good food and good wine. Fine recommendation.
3
Go during off peak hours to enjoy your vino in peace. Go on weekends to check out the hip crowd. Great price on wine. Good cheese platter for sharing
5
W ended up here by luck and loved it. We shared some nice cheeseplatter and also had a warm cheese/potato/veggie thing wich was devine!
4
This is a very nice wine bar in Singapore which will definitely fit to your budget. If you are a wine lower then this is the place which you should not miss. The wine selection is more than satisfactory and the restaurant crew will be happy to assist you during your selection. They have a very good cheese menu as well and you can create your plate with different numbers of cheese varieties
5
A real good selection of wine from all the world for very good prices.Being French, I enjoyed the Argentinian wine, but also the real Maroilles, and a very good "Foie Gras"I really did not expect such real good mealNegative: difficult to get some roquette (only) to go with cheese
4
Went there few times before on my own and was served by your staff, Neil. I am not a cheese fan, so I didnt order any raclette. Just went there for a quick drink and some dessert. Neil was very attentive. He kept checking if everything was alright, if anything else I need. As I was alone, he was being very kindand friendly to engage with me, which is also the reason why I didnt mind coming back again alone.Today I brought my friends along. Made a 6pm reservation, but we came like 10mins earlier. One of the staff (didnt manage to see her name) made a comment 'woah so early', which I was not quite happy. Can't I come early? As we had an early dinner, we were just there to chat, enjoy the wine and atmosphere. And the same staff asked if we would like to order any food, I said no. Then she came back again asking if we would like to order any dessert, giving the some face like 'you're here just for the drink?!'. Or perhaps I was just thinking too much.After some time, we were served by Neil again, still very friendly and attentive. He is very professional in giving his service. I guess he remembers my preference from the previous visits, as he was serving my friends ice water, and i was served with warm water(without me telling him). And yes, I prefer to drink warm rather than ice water. Thumbs up Neil for his excellent service, keep it up. Always looking forward to have a drink there and get served by hi
5
yesterday i just went to wine connection cheese bar and this is also the first time i visit, it was so crowded but the staff manage to give us good service, it was great! i was serve by a staff wendy and thiru i and my wife was very happy and the food was awesome too! i will sure come again
5
We use this regularly. The server Chris has always provided an excellent service with a smile. The cheese selection is fantastic and the wine good value.
5
This is my first time in this type and also my first encounter with the Raclette cheese
It was so delicious and accompanied with the right wine you touch the sky.
Professional service and wonderful atmosphere.
5
Met the awesome legendary Chris (Black Dragon) who serve us and recommend us the best wine and cheese in the world! Thumbs up for her awesome service & fantastic sense of humor!
5
Chris , your girl serving us is the most awesome and convincing staff I have ever met . 10 stars for her for making me laugh so much. Food is awesome . Cheese cheese and cheese . Heaven for cheese .
5
No point in holding back praise for fear that people will flock to Wine Connection, because it's already hard to get a table as it is. There's a reason for it's popularity - huge selection of wine, great selection of cheese with custom cheese platters, and prices are impossible to beat
5
We choose cheese and meat platters, and there was plenty. Bread, olives, nuts added to the platters, and our waitress was knowledgable about all of the cheeses we had chosen, from over 20 on the platter menu, plus lots more on the a la carte menu. The wine was chilled and reasonably priced for Hong Kong, seating outside amongst the lights was beautiful. Couldn't manage a dessert, although these looked tempting
3
Very nice combination of cheese and wine, had a few visits and their wine selection are the standards for the brand. A lot of couples come by and try their cheese fondue which look decent. The only issue is that this place is Super packed and often is difficult to find tables, great place to people watch and hang out with a relatively younger crowd. Chillax
5
We come here frequently to enjoy their affordable and good quality wines. The service is exceptional, even if it is crowded on Friday nights the staff stays calm and seems to be able to oversee everything, especially Cristina caught our attention because of her friendly and helpful nature. If you are lucky enough she will be serving you and I am sure you will have a great evening being pampered.The range of cheeses offered is phenomenal, if you are not a cheese lover their cold cuts platter is just as delicious
4
Dropped in to meet a mate standard hang out. We wanted an outside table but we're told it was full. The other, "section' was empty so I said can we sit there. No its not open until 6 (20 mins to go) No amount of questioning helped along with zero lateral thinking. This is the Singapore service problem.... We sat inside : ((Spanish red was excellent and cheese platter good as ever.
4
I starter visit wine connection every week a few times when my office in Raffles place. Wine connection was not very big unit. Service staff Chris is helpful to serve you. Don't forget to ask for Ms Chris to serve you and enjoyable wine experience James Leow
4
We stayed right at Robertson Walk so this was very convenient. The food, service, and ambience was great. The server provided great advise on the menu and would work for our appetite.
5
Just a very nice way to spend an afternoon. Wine was lovely. Food was scrumptious. It is a great place to meet people after work. I think most times you would have to reserve a table as it fill up quickly.
3
Lunch specials are great here, and you don't have to petition for a table at lunchtime like you would at night, when it's more competitive. Fab priced wines and pairing suggestions, we love the fondue as well.
5
Have not eaten in a place like this before menue exalent staff so willing to help. I would recommend this for the wine it is so well priced and the selection of cheeses must be the best out side of France
4
Always a treat to eat at the wine connection cheese bar.
Very good cheese and cold cuts selections. Salads are fresh and the Raclette is superb.
Great selection of wines at a decent price (which in singapore is very rare). Service overall is good.
2
Highly recommend this place for the masochist. Unbelievably and consistently rude staff, chef, executive chef supervised by an impotent manager. When ordering a $20 salad, the amount of grief and resistance created by a change in salad dressing due to a honey allergy was only matched by the chef's in-your-face rudeness and obnoxiousness. This had happened once before and the manager had assured me was an oversight never to be repeated. Alas, one month later, it happened again but this time with heightened animosity as the chef was offended that his creation (a SALAD) was not being respected 'as is'. Allow me to share, that both times we were the sole customers in the restaurant for lunch as we work in the area. How dare a customer have an opinion over what he or she would like to consume?!? GHASTLY service
4
Just up the river walk from Clarke Quay. Really good prices by the glass or the bottle for decent wines. Good selection. And then there is the cheese! We shared a plate of seven items, 2 ham and 5 cheese. Comes with fruit and bread. Excellent French cheeses. Nice stinky ones! Across Robertson Walk Plaza they have a slightly more formal full dining place with pretty good pub grub
5
Were there last night and had great time. Service was great and place has big choice of wine&cheese. Definetely would recommend this place! Prices are normal,)Did have a 'pleasure' to witness 2 'girls' next to us trying to run without paying their bill??!#? LOLBut at the end we enjoyed in good wine&cheese,) Cheers
4
Singapore is best known for its chinese food and then for its vaste range of international cuisines and it was fun to find a cheese specialist place and to go for the Raclette - melting cheese at the table and placing bread potatoes or (if you wanted which our table chose not to) cut meats under the melting cheese. The only thing we should have realised is the heat this would produce in an already hot place but the fun made up for the heat-discomfort
4
We were staying at the Park Hotel Clarke a Quay for a day's stopover on the way from the UK to Australia. We were recommended Wine Connection by our taxi driver for affordable, good quality wine, and it was just perfect for our first night in Singapore. A very short stroll from our hotel, nice atmosphere, great platters - with a choice of cheeses and cold meats, and very good salads. If we lived in Singapore, it would be a place I would go to after work with work colleagues or somewhere I would meet a friend for a drink and platter. Great if you are a wine and cheese fan. Fantastic selection of wines and cheeses. Service was a bit mixed, with one of the waitresses not very friendly
5
Excellent range of wines and cheeses at pretty good prices for Singapore. Owners clearly know how to put together a wine list. However some flexibility in cheese selection would be good, bit silly not being able to select across both pages of the menu.
4
Not what you expect when you're out for a drink and meal in Singapore.
A great selection of cheeses and wines in comfortable surroundings.
Not the fastest service but if you have the munchies and enjoy wine, then well worth a try.
4
Wide assortment of wines that are so reasonably priced, you may go overboard on the alcohol limits, so beware. Food selection though is rather limited, so perhaps have your meal nearby and then adjourn here for cheese and wines.
5
This place is very busy...always. So best to make a reservation. This is part of the Wine Connection suite of restaurants in Robertson Walk, and is the most casual of the three. Great assortment of cheese plates to enhance your wine selection. Very reasonably priced.
5
Strongly recommended!! Good, affordable wine, great selection of cheese. I always have a great time at this place :)
4
In a non cheese city someone knows there French cheese. Platters are a great combination of loved cheese and great bread.
5
Had a great time celebrating my birthday at Cheese Bar.
Ian, Ryan, Shawn and Darren had went a special mile to make my birthday special when the bar closed at midnight.
5
Really good cheeses and extensive wine menu. All who live in Singapore know Wine connection restaurants. In the restaurants they have a good choice of wines but the food is so so (affordable dinner). But the wine bar is different. Here the food (cheese!!!) is perfect as well as the wines. Singspore is known for expensive wines and this place has very reasonable priced wines. Good location near Robinson Quay. Have been here many times.Recommended to start an evening out with wine and cheeses
5
What shall I say more? Uh yeah portions where big, selection was wide, quality was impressive. Price was super reasonable considering Singapore standards. -Small selection of Italian cheese, but i guess it is cause french know How to export better than Italians. +++ open till late, rare in Singapore. Here it is not Just Snack
5
My friend and I decided to spend time together and catch up after a long time in Wine Connection Cheese Bar. We never regret choosing to go to this place as we really did enjoy the wines (2 bottles: Sangiovese from Italy and Tempranillo from Italy as well) and the meat and cheese selection that we have. Not to mention Our server, Shawn's recommended dessert which is the chocolate cake like dessert. We never had any decent service in singapore before but when we dined in Wine Connection, our experience was extraordinary. The quality of the wine was very nice and not over priced as well as the meat and cheese board. The most important thing that we really enjoyed was Shawn's extraordinary service. He is very kind and knowledgeable in what he does and he really treat us like VIPs. He doesn't go overboard and suggest only tbe high priced wines but really say what he thinks we will like according to our preferences. Thank you Shawn for everything and we will surely come back!:)
4
What else do you need?! With wine at these prices, it's hard to say no. The platters are perfect. Service could get a little better but isn't too bad, and there's nothing too complicated so everything goes smoothly.
5
The raclette is as good as any I've had in Europe. Recommended by my French mates which says a lot. Great find in Singapore where European food is more miss than hit.
5
Brilliant collection, reasonable price, great location and wonderful ambiance. Time of visit should be early evening as this place gets crowded pretty fast !
4
This is a great location on 11 Unity Street. Basically a wine shop that also acts a bar/restaurant. Great selection of wines. Nothing is cheap in Singapore, so $50SGD for a decent bottle of wine is to be expected. I did not eat here, so cannot judge. I go here for the good wines and atmosphere. Expect a big line of taxi waiting going out, so make reservations.
5
I visited cheese bar last night with a friend and had a very enjoyable experience. Total bill was only $78 and we had 5 cheeses, 2 types of ham, fresh olives and mineral water. Not bad given prices generally in Singapore. All 5 cheeses were quite good! The cooked ham was rather forgettable, but the aged ham was excellent. Overall, a good value.The atmosphere was nice and for a Friday night the crowd was pleasant and not many loud drunks. So, very easy to have a proper conversation here. Our server, Cristina, was pleasant, professional, and fun to talk with. She is a real gem, so ask for her tables when you visit.Bottom line, good cheese, good atmosphere, and very good service
2
We were staying close by to this Wine bar/Bistro and often walked past it on our way to Robertson Walk Plaza and thought the look of the cheese plate being enjoyed at the outside settings on the pavement looked good. Hence we booked a table for 4 promising to take two friends along for a meal. Imagine how upset and disappointed we were when we turned up at the appointed time to be told there were no tables available and there were 8 people in front of us waiting!!! What about our booking???? Well apparently that didn't matter obviously they gave our table away to other customers. This is not on and we decided not to wait but to eat at one of the many other restaurants nearby
4
Wine & Cheese was all we ever wanted after few months in Asia. This place didn't let us down, great spot, nice atmosphere and a very good selection of cheese. We had a platter with 3 types of cheese and it was enough for the 3 of us (we're not that big..). Definitely coming bac
5
Had some wine and cheese over there and was served by 3 lovely servers named. Celestin, Ryan and Kelvin. Although you see them busy but they will always attend to you first. Best service from this 3. Highly recommended to find 3 servers for great dining experienc
4
We dropped by for tea and were pleasantly surprised! I was amazed by the variety of cheese they stocked up in the glass-panelled fridges that lines the wall as you walk in. The wines varieties were just as plentiful. Service was good and it was just an experience being there. Lovely afternoon
5
Absolutely loved this spot at Robertson Walk. Great service by waiter who was familiar with the extensive wine list and cheese selection, and we enjoyed the fact that we could choose exactly what we wanted, size wise - 3 cheese, some cold meat and served with fresh bread, chutney and some nuts. Highly recommended
4
I wished they had better wine glasses to fully enjoy the wine. Cheese and meat platter was excellent and probably he most reasonably priced items in singapore.
5
Absolutely fantastic place! We took a cheese platter first time we went, raclette second time. Both very good! Service of our waiter Ryan Jiang was very friendly, true personal and enjoyable! Absolutely recommendable!
4
We came here last night after dinner around the corner at the Wine Connection Tapas Bar, ordered a selection of cheeses and some dessert wine. Service was efficient, cheeses were great and prices were reasonable. Only real area of improvement is the knowledge level of service staff - the wine list is quite extensive and the level of understanding about the various wines seems a bit limited. Otherwise it's all good stuff
5
I have to come back, humbly, on one of my previous comment about wine connection Cheese bar at robertson quay. The fact is that this place is probably the one place in Singapore where you can see excellent service and high sense of customer care really means. Every one there, from the manager to the supervisors, to the waiters are all dedicated to turn the time you will spend there as one of the best experience. Of course the wine you can get there and the price you pay for them contribute to this wonderful customer experience but I will definitely put first the quality of the service and the way everyone is focus on offering their customers an awesome moment. It is a Must to go there is you pass buy Singapor
5
I grew up eating Raclette. I was pleasantly surprised by the quality I found here. Great value wines, cozy setting, and the right cheeses. I will definitely be back. Two suggestions for improvement: 1/ need a Raclette special for single visitor (right now, it is two persons min) 2/ better way to collect the cheese. The spoon didn't quite work for me. All in all: a great place. Keep your prices low. I will be here often
5
Perfection!!! What a great way to have an enjoyable meal with a glass of wine... My sister and I wanted to go somewhere 'easy' and this ticked all the boxes. We ordered a bottle of wine and an assortment of cheeses and breads and a spinach and goats cheese salad. Restaurants in Singapore can be quite expensive but this restaurant was very reasonably priced. The bill came to $120 (Â£60 approx) which was good value based on what we had (I forgot to mention we had another 2 glasses of wine!!) and the excellent service we has as well. I can't wait to go back ;-
5
Came here for the first time last week, and it became a top favourite immediately! We had the Raclette set (because who can resist melted cheese fondue), and it was AMAZING. Utterly delicious! The service was also impeccable; the staff were all very attentive & friendly :) I particularly liked how humorous & cheerful the staff were, it really brightened up my day and made the dining experience all the more enjoyable. The wine was also great and reasonably priced; we had the recommended pairing Pinot Noir, and it complemented the raclette fabulously.All in all: excellent food, cosy ambience, and fantastic service!! Highly recommended place! Looking forward to trying the cheese platter next time ;
1
Few months ago I checked the web of cheese bar to see the closing time and It say at 1am . we arrived before that time and they told us they closed already.Today after a months we think to try again.We have arrived at 10:35pm and they say at 12pm we have the leave. Understanding for the new law. But we told to the lady we have 1 hour and a half to have some cheese and a glass of wine.!she say the glass yes but no food.Honestly, is the second time that I spent my money in the taxi and my Value time to come to this place, and will be the last time.I
5
Ate here for lunch and dinner what a gem of a place pity they dont have one in melbourne great selection of food and especially cheeses the beers are cheap and also the wines with a great wine list the place is packed every night and open till 2.30 am This place is great value for food compared to other places in singapore Highly recomene
4
Was here again tonight with a friend and we had a thoroughly enjoyable evening. The cheese platter was great, foie gras pate was great, bread basket excellent and service is reasonably OK despite it being a packed Saturday night. Portions are reasonably big and great value for money. Wine is cheap but good. Food was OK, I'd stick to wine and cheese for this place. Perhaps eat somewhere else and come here for after-dinner drinks and cheese platter. Get a table inside as outside is really hot and people smoke around you despite the No Smoking sign everywhere. I'm all cheesed-out! in a good way
4
We sat at a corner with view of the wine cellar and spent a hot afternoon drinking to cool ourselves down. It's a lovely place. We didn't try the food though.
4
Maybe a bit strange to drink French/Italian/Austrian wine in Singapore, let alone eat French cheese in Singapore. But the combination works wonderfully good ...
Nice collection of cheeses, and plenty of wine (also by the glass)
4
Good location. Good ambient. Good food. Reasonable prices (within Singapore standard)
A great place to meet friends in a casual setting.
2
I have been a regular customer for 4 years and I come here every other days. The wines are good and affordable, they have a very large choice from most regions of the world. But there is something that is really going worse and worse, the service. Few months/ year ago, the team was very professional and focus on customer satisfaction. It's not anymore the case now... Not that the waiters are not nice but they are not professional and there are obviously not enough of them. Too bad... As I was writing this cement the waiter just told me that I have to leave the table as they need it for someone else... I am left standing with my glass... So nice, then I change the rating I was about to give ... This is just not acceptable
5
Love wine Connection... great excuse to stop and enjoy the moment.Great selection of well priced wines and I love that the fabulous cheese boards can be customised to taste.This became a weekly hangout while in Singapore for an extended visit either to catch up with friends or to while a way an hour on my own
5
Very relaxing atmosphere and a great way to enjoy some wines and taste various cheeses. We spent a great couple of hours enjoying 3 different cheeses we selected from an extensive menu along with a great fresh salad and basket of breads. There are many wines to choose from and we had a Prosecco, Pinot Grogio and a red from Montepulciano a town we have previously visited in Tuscany. Staff were friendly, attentive and knowledgeable and service was fast. We would recommend this bar for anyone wanting a great relaxing evening or afternoon enjoying great food and wines
4
After a couple of recent visits, I almost didn't want to write a review - as I didn't want too many people to find out about it. Not that it is that good - but still it will go the way of other such places in Singapore if too many people start landing up here. The Wine Connection store next door has a good, value collection of French wines, including many from the Rhone valley, which they serve up at the cheese bar. The cheese bar has many types of cheeses, and other finger foods - but it is mostly famous for the Savoie specialty, raclette
5
Loved this place - fabulous evening out.I met a group of friends and found this place to be fabulous. We stayed at a table from about 7.30pm until around midnight and at no stage did I feel rushed. The service was great and with a great smile (and sense of humour).We had some gorgeous red wine and then some of the cheeses / cold meats / olives etc.....Delicious.Cannot want to return again
5
Friendly staff helped us get a table really quick on a busy day, took order and came back in practically seconds with the bottle we asked for (that was great). Selection is good and cheese was great. Prices, for Singapore, are very fair. And on top, great ambient. Busy, noisy, friendly, relaxed.Very high recommendation
2
The place is full at that time with expats and locals. The concept is appealing and refreshing in this part of the world. The wine list is limited, the cheese choice is limited and the rest is OK. This correlates with the heading, the owner introduced a concept but it is just not it, e.g. at least for a European. The attitude of the staff is professional and they want to convince you that cheese and wine is a Singaporean invention. The value for money is average. We (4pp) ordered a cheese platter with a combination of hard cheese (4), soft cheese (4), some blue cheese (2), a salad with duck, some foie gras and two bread baskets. We ordered a white wine (Pouilly FumÃ©), reasoning it was a strong but fruity wine sitting outside in the tropics. The dressing of the salad was too sweet to go with the duck. We enjoyed the plates and we decided to order additional foie gras, which was served on a small breakfast plate without anything. We asked the staff whether they forgot the toast. We were informed that we had to order a bread basket (baquettes, two buns, two small ciabattas and two toast) to get toast. Finally the manager (Tony) got involved and with shear arrogance informed us that this was the policy of the restaurant and we were not in Europe and had to accept it. How about flexibility and client/service centric we asked him. We even offered to pay for a full bread basket if he could bring us some toast. He walked away irritated and came back with two slices of toast for 4 persons. The bill was S$ 340.- including an additional bread basket. Thank God, they could not ruin the taste of the European cheese, the European foie gras and the European wine
5
This friendly bar offers good cheese and wine variety and is relatively cheap - especially for Singapore standards.
I fully recommend it for light dinner or evening snack.
5
It was for a company dine out when go here and i can say that this place is highly recommended. Food are not that expensive. Service is a little above average.
4
We had a tasty raclette with a selection of accompaniments - it was great! We also had a delicious bottle of Malbec for only $30!
Will definitely return.
4
Wine connection is in a good location and has a good selection of cheeses, and they are fresh and tasty. As for the wine selection not so grand, could do with an up date.
3
Walked in to Wine Connection Tapas a few minutes away waved at a staff but got ignored. Walked in and signalled to another staff for the menu, was told we were not allowed to drink or dine outside at the tall chairs until 6pm. Couldn't understand the reason why except ''Not opened till 6pm" It was a nice afternoon and we just like to have a bottle of wine outdoor. Unreasonable policy. Decided to walk to the cheese place. Had a bottle of wine and snacks. The bread really hard to slice. As we were still enjoying our drinks, a staff asked if she could move us to a different table for 2 as we were occupying a table for 4. She told us a group of 5 already there and she needed the table for them. We obliged. To our surprise, a lady moved from a table of 2 to that table and for 30 minutes or so, no one else joined her. There was no group of 5 in sight. Kind of rude indeed to ''lie'' if I may use that word
5
Instead of our usual Sunday places to eat with our daughter, we suddenly had a craving for raclette. I can’t recall the last time in Singapore service was this good. Staff were extremely accommodating, going to great lengths to find us space and a chair for our 4 year old. The food was superb value and really authentic. OK so the table a wee bit small but we refused a bigger area. The Pinot Grigio at $30 bottle was also highly drinkable. Once again, I can’t say enough about how friendly and efficient the staff were
3
I would have raved about this place. Great wine (fantastic prices for Singapore) super service, and nice food containing cheese.....but last visit was poor. Very poor. No order taken, food cold when it appeared, just not what I had begun to expect. I hope they up their game again
5
We have been going here for 3 years. It is in two parts - the wine and cheese bar, our preferred venue, and now also has an enormous restaurant serving a wide range of meals. The wine and cheese bar offers really good French cheeses, plus a few other items including raclette if you're in the mood. Its wines are exceptionally well priced by Singapore standards, and a good mid range choice. You can eat indoors or out. Service is mostly good, with some lapses. Our only real gripe is that if you choose the cheese platters, which are excellent, the amount of bread included in the price is not quite enough - but you then have to pay an astronomic amount, relatively speaking, for an extra bread basket, which then tends to be a bit too much

15 ladies arrived yesterday lunchtime. Restaurant busy but not packed. Majority of us ordered lunch specials. Large tables came in after us, served and left whilst we waited. Some ladies had finished meal whilst other only had starter. 11/2 later some were still waiting. We're told coming 2min 2 min. Only 1 waiter did his best to help others were just not interested. My herb butter was still frozen when we left and my steak altho rare was stone cold, assuming cooked rare and then left for waiting staff to serve for a long time. In the end friend who waiting over an 11/2 for carbonara was delivered after many queries,again cold and pasta still floury and under cooked. We left in the end many including myself still waiting on desserts and coffee, included in set lunch. Were told no mgr or no one in charge to deal with our complaints. Some managed to have service charge removed but couldn't get any discount for those that were still waiting on a course. An absolute disgrace and shambles and ruined a special get togethe

This location serves a great variety of wine and cheese. Reasonable ambient and though it is popular, it is not too noisy. Nice cheese combo set for variety of flavor. It is a good place to take a break a business associates. A place that we will return.

Been here several times, always great food with my favourite raclette. So many wines, Italians do it better. Price is the best part.

We had some good wine in this cozy location by the taxi stand, perfect venue for people watching.
Staff are very helpful, especially Cristina who always provides good and warm service.
Already went there a few time and will come back again.

Great service, great atmosphere, great food, great wine selection, happy staff. Wife happy, friends happy. Will be back with the mother-in-law.

Been here with resident friends, the place is pretty large, and nicely located. The food was ok, service ok as well, usual singapore experience, nothing wrong but just nothing special about it, tomorrow I'll forget it. Anyway the wine selection and price is the best part about it

Generally speaking this is one of the better places (value, quality) in the Robertson Walk area. The staff can be helpful with the food paring, would suggest you walk next door to the Wine Connection bottle shop and select your wine in person (unfortunatley the current staff is not very knowledgable in the wine department). The exception is Ryan Jang (he can be found in either shop), if he's there he'll help you with a complete food and wine paring that you won't be dissapointed with. Overall it's a great place to spend a few hours in the afternoon

Wine pricing in Singapore is often so exorbitant it's mind boggling. This is not. I had a lovely French Rose for $7 a glass and the wine list is not only reasonably priced, but it's well researched and varied. The cheese selections were fabulous and the construct your own style of the platters (i.e. order separates) works well. Def worth a stop in the air-conditioning (or outdoors) with free wifi on offer and closely located to all the Robertson Walk/Quay restaurants

First time we have managed to get a table here...SO worth the effort! The Raclette was sensational! If you don't know what Raclette is.....it's cheese placed under a heater....it melts, then eaten hot and gooey with baguette, cold cuts, potatoes..... Wicked!The cheese cabinet...to die for.. Wine list..extensive, and such good prices!Great service, atmosphere, food, wine, and inexpensive. Love it

Whilst I used to buy my wines from Wine Connection in Thailand when I lived there, I had never been to the SG outlets until August of this year. I now wish I had gone much sooner because the wines and cheeses are delicious, of good quality and above all very affordable! This will now become a regular spot for a lazy weekend brunch, lunch, dinner or late night snack! If cheese is not your thing, there are a couple of salads you can choose from but mostly this place is for those that love the finer cheeses in life, e.g. Epoisses and many more! I hesitated to endorse this place because I would selfishly like to avoid it becoming any more crowded, however this place deserves to be recognised (and hopefully any further fame will encourage the owners to consider another outlet)

No reason not to start your weekend and end it here. I come round with my friends quite abit, it's always the best bet yet. Good service, look out for the manager in charge, Vann. He leads a team of a well trained service crew! Awesome place to hang out for a few or too many drinks!

We visit Wine connection Cheese Bar on a regular basis, typically with friends so there's usually a minimum of 4 people sometimes upwards of 8. Most nights of the week the atmosphere is buzzing, the wine selection is large and the price of the wine is typically easy on the wallet. Whether for pre dinner drinks or as our main venue for the evening we always opt for at least a starter size platter of mixed cheese and meats as they are of excellent quality and have never disappointed us. Meanwhile there also needs to be made mention of the Service quality which is as good as the food and wine selection, the team are attentive and friendly led by Tony the ever vigilant and efficient manager - well done to them

Would highly recommend this place. Amazing food and amazing wine. This place has to be my most favourite place.

Great selection of cheeses and cheap wines, also fresh salads. Service was just ok like most places in Singapore, the reply is cannot. But will go back again. Had a business meeting there over a salad and cheese platter with a nice Chardonnay.

The restaurant's cheese platter and homemade tartines made a satisfying dinner for a girl's night out. Will definitely be back for the ambience and affordable wine!
5
We have been travelling for quite a while now and were really craving some good quality cheese. This place satisfied us and beyond! A wonderful selection of cheeses, nice breads and chutneys to go with it, and very affordable too. I was shocked at the value - it was no different prices to anywhere in Europe (where all the cheeses come from), yet here they are flown half way round the world! We had a delicious bottle of Argentinian wine too, and once again this was fantastic value. I'm sure we'll be back here, and I'd thoroughly recommend it.

This is one of 3 related outlets all in the same proximity of Robertson Quay/Clarke Quay - Cheese Bar, Wine Shop/Bar, and Tapas bistro. I frequented the Cheese Bar for a lunch, and the Wine Bar for a nightcap glass of wine with a colleague. I was most impressed with the international wine selection, and the relative affordability (for Singapore) of the glasses and bottles. The wine list included many wines by the glass and from many different countries. As wine is my drink of choice, and I've been fortunate in my travels to experience great wines from many wine producing countries, I would definitely recommend this place if in search of good wine. As for the lunch at the Cheese Bar, I had a salad which was fresh and tasty. The cheese selection was impressive too, and nice presentation of the cheeses in glass-doored frig's. As for the service, my server was not that friendly - might have been near shift change as a different one tended to me later during my stay - but delivered my order quickly

Celebrated a girl friend's birthday here, and we had an amazing time! The selection of cheese and wine is superb, great for sharing, and decently priced. Fret not if you aren't a wine connoisseur as the menu already pairs the wine with different types of cheeses, and the waiters are helpful too. Loved the ambience of the place, and would definitely return.
5
The title says it all. Simply stunning and the simplicity is a joy. Choose from a range of delicious cheeses, add the bits to go with and consume with a glass or two (+) of wine of your choice. Fast, efficient service , no pressure to finish food to turn table. If you like cheese and wine this is a winning combination. 11/10 if that were possible

Am a fan of the place, that is until they gave a stupid non excuse for not being able to alter a dish. You see, I don't eat pork. How hard is it to replace ham with pastrami for example in a salad? In my book, easy. At Wine Connection, simply impossible. Least customer oriented policy I know. My guess is am also not the only person in Singapore not eating pork and not catering for these requirements is just simply poor (no) business sense
5
Accommodating, friendly, flexible, fast and knowledgeable is the best way to describe this lovely spot. Food quality is awesome and fresh, wine selection has for everybody's taste something.Any downside? Yes, you can't make late reservations... We had a small event there and everything was smooth from inquiry till the bill was presented.I really wish other restaurants would value their customer with such warm and professional service.Compliment

If you never had the Swiss raclette before you will start to love it here. If you had it before you will rediscover how good it can be and enjoy a fantastic feast. Go for raclette, the bigger the group you are in the better. The wine is not expensive but good, service is friendly, crowd is interesting. A place to go and have fun, really
5
Love the place a lot, it provides a good selection of cheeses and wines. And on top of the good quality of food, the price is reasonable and affordable. Thumbs up :)
4
wow! Wine Connection is really a very good place. I went with some of my singaporean friends for get together. I enjoyed this place.
5
And the best most amazing salad choices ever...will be going there every time I come to SGP for work! Don't miss this place. Has a strong smell of slightly off-cheese, really adds to the mood in the place...
5
What a Nice place to Chill out . Very Nice White Wine... And love the cheese. Smell so good... The terrasse was Nice to drink . Lové the concept and Nice décoration...
4
Cheap price. Friendly service. Good food and wine.
Worth trying!
Tip: try their signature dish Raclette! Also convenient with a attached wine shop with awesome selection in retail.
5
We love cheese and wine, this bar is all what we need ! The cheese selection is huge, wine is cheap and foie gras soooooo good !!!
4
All i can say is that the ambiance was fantastic.
We ordered bleu cheese for 2$ per slice and red wine. It was a perfect combination! We will definetely come back to this place.
5
This is a very informal and jolly bistro with an extraordinary selection of cheeses to accompany platters of cold cuts or toasted 'tartines' or giant salads; but the cheeses can also stand alone paired with a large selection of excellent wines at unusually low prices for Singapore --from S$30 and up. The ambience is buzzing with young, chic and spiffy professionals and it is clearly one of the most popular watering holes of Singapore, located at Robertson Walk, near the River. The patrons seem unfazed by the constant flow of taxis alongside their nibbles, although this is not always very pleasant. Desserts (S$6) include a terrific extreme chocolate mousse.Take-out available as well
5
Great selection of wine, retail cheese shop, perfect for business meeting or friend outing.I love it! Awesome mix of clientele, multicultural and attentive staff, value for money. Here you get all. Try the 7 cheese platter, Foie Gras and the big salads!Good service is hard to find, but here, all staff attentive, polite, even up-selling!I spend a great late night with my business partners and share this great experience here in my very first review.Thanks Wine Connection

Evening out with a group of friends and ordered the Raclette , portion was ok but they only serve one small basket of bread which is hardly enough and additional bread is chargeable. Prices reasonable but over all experience was not so impressive
4
Visited while around Robertson quay and very happy. Good quality wine at good price for Singapore ! Taxi rank outside also for when you drink too much! Cheese not bad either !
5
I frequently visit the cheese bar, great value wine, fabulous cheese, brilliant service, what else do you need.
5
Great varieties of cheeses, mainly French including Alpine and Savoie - worth visiting! Very clean, excellent value and worth a visit for good cheeses!
5
Wine connection always offers a great wine selection with many wines available by the glass at very reasonable prices. The cheese selection is just as good, if not better.
4
A good choice of cheese and a wine list with European prices and still good wines, very good value for the wine here in Singapore. Ok the weather is much better other wise we could have been an evening in Brussels :)

If you do not fancy a full meal, but would prefer some cold cuts and/or a cheese platter with some wine, then it's hard to beat this place. The selection of cheeses is extensive and they are well kept and presented. Cold cuts of meat are also available, although a more limited selection. Platters are charged by the number of items you select per order. This allows you to, for instance, select only soft cheeses, or more blue, etc. It works well, although it might be nice to have a more obvious "pot luck" selection, which would save making those difficult choices!The wine list is the star, though. This is one of very few venues in Singapore where there is a good selection of wine at reasonable prices. You can have some very good quality wines here for under Sin$50 per bottle, which is good for Singapore! The only reason this does not score a solid 5 points is the fact that on the previous 2 occasions I have visited, a total of 4 wines I selected from the menu were unavailable. The waitress was a little unclear as to the reason for this. Perhaps that was wise, because now I can't comment further.Notwithstanding, this is a great place to go to share a bottle or two with friends

The Wine Connection Cheese Bar on Unity Street is my number one choice for taking business or personal guests who are looking for a refreshing experience of wine and light food in Singapore.The selection of wines, fresh cheeses, fruits and baguettes, served with style on a wooden board with garnish, is a fun culinary and social experience of sharing, celebrating and rejuvenating. You might even forget you are in Singapore and reminisce about your favorite European Bistro. For an exceptionally unique experience, with origins from Switzerland cuisine, the raclette is a culinary experience of aromas, flavors and textures which will surprise and delight your guests.This is an ideal selection for a small group of 2, 3 or 4 with whom the sharing of a special meal is desired, with an element of surprise and intrigue
4
I go here quite regularly with groups of friends or as a couple. This is simply the best overall wine bar I have found so far in Singapore having lived here for 2+ years ... very reasonable prices, excellent wine, great choice of cheeses and cold cuts . and very efficient and attentive service.I have found that many [other] wine venues and bars here serve quite mediocre wine for a high price .. which is why I tend to go to wine connection.. the venue works well for either couples, groups of friends, or business
4
If you love cheese and good wine and you don't want to spend all your pocket money, this is the place. Nice and relax Ambiance, friendly staff. You can get over 20 different cheeses and eat a delicious raclette (better to be inside) again for a very reasonable price
4
A social night out in Singapore can be costly especially if you are an expat who is accustomed to good quality cheese and wine. I would definitely recommend Wine Connection Cheese Bar at Unity Street to anyone who wants to hang out with their friends at a place where they can relax with nice wine, cold meat and cheese. The staff at the bar are friendly and knowledgeable about wine. Friday evenings can be busy, however the staff will always try to accommodate you if you don't mind waiting for a table. Enjoy
