Came here with a friend on a Friday night. Service was impeccable with very attentive waiters. Food was delicious and with a very portion size. Will definitely be back for more!
4
Had the degustation menu ,some hit some miss.The appetiser and steak were pretty impressive but not the pasta and dessert.Overall standard (quality,quantity and taste) is above average but they need to work harder on the combination of each dishes to reach fine dining standard.
4
Made reservation through chope Singapore but it wasn’t reflected on their RSVP system. However the greeter welcomed us reacted really quickly and lead us to a quiet table. We tried one of the specialties of that day and it was really nice!
4
Posh interior suitable for a quiet evening out. Attentive staff who makes us feel at ease and gave us excellent recommendations on the dishes. Will visit again!
5
Very good ialian fine dining food and wine selection!Polite and good service!nice and romantic atmosphere!
5
Excellent Italian food with high and outstanding quality!The location is amazing.Attentive and friendly service!
5
We have tried Bracci, Il Lido, Amo and now Osteria Art. This restaurant has the best food and service across the chain. Very welcoming and at home. Fresh seafood. Loved the Hokkaido scallops in a bisque sauce and the tagliatelle Uni. Desserts was also outstanding. The yuzu sherbet is the best I have tried. The combination of Japanese ingredient and Italian style cooking brings the food to another higher level!We will be back

This restaurant in the ground floor of Bank of Singapore building, and there are many big banks near by too. So this very popular as a bankers restaurant and price will certainly at relatively high end. Yet, the food quality is good so as the services too, professional!We had a set lunch, with scallop as a starter and sea bass as main course. The fish was very fresh and perfectly prepared! For a basic three course mill, likely between SGD50 to SGD60 per head for a set lunch with all taxes and services charge include
1
The food here really lets the place down. Nice decor and very charming waiter were the highlights.My ravioli was revolting with a sqidgy tasteless filling in a broth full of grit with sage leaves that were tired and without any flavour. The other menu items were odd overfussy and none of the other diners looked happy. I do not think the chef was remotely Italian.Give this place a wide berth-alsoS$ 8 for a tiny bottle of tonic water. Outrageous

After hearing from friends who gave good reviews for this restaurant, we decided to try it out as a family dinner on a weekend. The food was ok but there was nothing to rave about. In addition, the rather cramped layout did not give diners a comfortable dining experience. Prices were also relatively high, compared to the food you are getting, the cramped feeling and overall average dining experience. Would be ok as a restaurant on the average price range, but not as one priced higher than that
5
The service staff is very attentive, lovely food and well presented and the atmosphere was very warm and romantic. Good choice , we will back .
:))))
5
Amazing atmosphere at Osteria Art!The service staff was very attentive and well acknowledged about the food served!At the end of our dinner Chef Andrea has been to the table to collect some feedback about the food enjoyed!Really appreciated!
4
We had a great dinner in a restaurant with nice ambience and good service. The rocher is a must try.
We went on a weekend so being in the CBD, it was quiet and parking was easy.
5
Went with my Friends and enjoyed the Degustation Menù!The food was very tasty and the service was very attentive.!well Done!
5
To pamper myself a little, visited Osteria again. Lucky enough braised beef was in the set menu again. The starter burrata went so well with a burst of cherry tomato in your mouth.
4
Service was good as ever, friendly and professional. slightly disappointed with the ravioli in an otherwise good lunch. Slightly expensive however worth it for important meetings
4
Came here for a set lunch with my husband. During the week, this is definitely more a business lunch/colleague type of place. Great food and good value for money though.
5
Have been with my friend at Osteria Art at 55 Market Street (CBD area)!Very close to Republic Plaza Car Park!As usual the service was excellent very friendly and polite!The Chef recommended us a few dishes from the menÃ¹ and specials!The Homemade Sea Urchin Pasta was delicious and the Beef tenderloin was very juicy and tender!We paired our dinner with a fantastic half bottle of Brunello di Montalcino (not so easy to find in other restaurants).we will back
5
Most certainly did not regret celebrating our wedding anniversary here. Had dinner on a week day evening and the restaurant was operating at full capacity but despite that, the wait staff were all attentive to customers needs and had a great service attitude, everyone of them had a ready smile. Food was impeccable, the must-try dish is definitely the Charcoal grilled beef tenderloin with asparagus and truffle. The chef has the tenderloin cooked to perfection and doneness was perfect (ordered medium rare) while the copious amount of truffle is simply decadent.Looking forward to returning again, keep it up
5
Had lunch with four others at Italian restaurant Osteria Art last Thursday. The food was really great and their Angus beef especially was fantastic! It was the best I have had locally and beats hands down many of the more up market places including some Michelin starred restaurants!Leave room for dessert as they have more selection than others and those we tried was very delicious especially their tiramisu!The ambiance was warm and lively and the service was impeccable - special thanks to their Assistant Manager, Mags Asari, who not only advised on the choices of food and drinks available but was also very cheerful, courteous, knowledgeable and entertaining throughout the two hours plus that we were there even though the place was quite crowded. Prices was really value for money too and I would definitely return and would also not hesitate to recommend to all. Reservation highly advised for lunch (not sure about dinner but best to reserve too)
5
Thanks for the birthday dinner We had a great time. Great food as well. We liked your service and we definitely will be coming back this December for our office party..
4
The wine selection is great and staff recommendations were on point. Love the romantic ambience. Will be back.
5
Went for Dinner!The Food was very tasty and the service very attentive and polite!The Chef introduced us the dishes, we really appreciated!we will back!
5
Service was fast and very attentive even if the restaurant was totally fully booked!The food was fabulous and well presented even the portion size was generous!we will definitely come back!
5
We always pass by this place during lunch and it's always crowded so we decided to give it a shot for dinner. It was fantastic! Definitely less busy that it is during lunch, but the food and drinks are top notch. The wine list is extensive, and the food is really good. If you can't get a table here during lunch, really recommend going for dinner
5
If you’re looking for a place to take your loved ones for a special occasion - bring them to Osteria Art. The place is so classy, from the presentation of the dishes to the fancy decorations and the attentive service staff! My to-go place for special occasions. Thumbs up
5
I have been with my friend.. we had nice Foie Gras to share as appetaizer which was very tastefull and we'll balance.For mains we follow the Manager reccomendation a amazing Cod served with Scampi souce and incredible tender Beef from Australia.!Service was very friendly and attentive..
5
Been down to Osteria Art @55Market St and the food, drinks as well as service was spot on! The young italian manager and his assist manager took great care of us and everything that they suggested of the menu was bursting out in flavour has they discribed the dishes. They even paired beautiful wine to go with our meals. A job well done and will surely be back soon
5
If you read my reviews, you will know I am absolutely impossible to please. I love to cook, but cooking is not my profession. Therefore I find it inexcusable to dine somewhere where the “chef” can’t even match my humble standards.Anyway, on to Osteria Art. Firstly, whoever owns this restaurant has managed to nab two consummate professionals in Federico, the restaurant manager, and Andrea, the chef. The entire team is there to serve their customers exquisitely.Let’s get on with the food....the burrata and prosciutto with shaved truffle was to die for, an extremely generous serve of unctuous olive oil drizzled burrata, taken to an extreme umami level by the freshly micro planed truffle...sitting on a veritable mountain of finely shaved Parma.We shared the ravioli with lobster sauce and a fillet of beef with fresh asparagus and truffle. I have never had ravioli in a restaurant that were as silky and beautifully executed as these. The beef was divine, cooked to perfection.I live in an inner city suburb of Sydney that’s supposed to be an Italian dining destination, and I have never had the high quality of Italian food there that my daughter and I enjoyed at lunch time.If I could award this more than 5 stars, I would! Well done Osteria Art
5
My mum and I came here for lunch on a weekday. The service was welcoming and the food outstanding. We had ultra creamy burrata with prosciutto and fresh truffle shavings for appetiser, followed by the most tender tenderloin steak from South Australia and oozy, soft cheese filled ravioli for main course. It was a little pricey but the gorgeous food, excellent drinks list and beautiful table setting make it well worth it. Be sure to reserve a table during the week, as their power lunch menu is popular and the place was pretty much packed.
5
One of our friends is unwell and to cheer her, Osteria had a slice of tiramisu with “Stay strong, <name>” on the plate for her even though we only told them when we reach the Restaurant. The group of us were very touch!
4
One of my favourite restaurant. Great service and ambience at a reasonable price. Great for business lunches or casual dinners.
3
Very excellent service and great atmosphere ... Having a good time with family.
i had noted down to Chope it is my birthday, yet there are no any special surprise from the restaurant.
Hope there are more improvement on the Food ...
4
Service was excellent at Osteria, the staff were extremely knowledgeable on the food, ingredients, and also very attentive. Our food was yummy, and really tasty. Prices are high, but with the entertainer app it was still acceptable for a Friday date night.
5
Even though there was limited option for me as I am a picky eater, they managed to keep me happy with ala cart
5
Easy to find location. Attentive staff. Staff is able to recommend food. Clean environment. Good food
5
We really enjoyed our lunch today, food was so good that we are planning to return for dinner in near future. Especially love the Iberico pork ribs and tuna tartare. Service was relatively good. I forgot to bring my hp and needed to make a short urgent call. Staff Mr Jit learned about it and let me use his personal hp. Very impressed.Would like to thank him again for his kind gesture
5
Went there for weekday dinner and it was surprisingly quiet. I guess they do business lunch crowd, being in the centre of the CBD - which is good when you want somewhere nice, with good food, attentive service and not overly packed. I had the Veal Milanese *amazing*. Highly recommended
5
Singapore is full of good places to eat which sometimes makes it hard to find the great ones. This is one. Tucked away in the CBD this is a lovely place. Food is good, fussy but in a good way, the wine list is good (albeit mainly reds) and the service is helpful. A useful find and worth a visit.
4
We had a nice dinner at Osteria, the service is very professional although the waiters should refrain from ironing the tablecloths on tables next to customers having dinner. It does not look nice. The food was tasty, well cooked and nicely arranged on the plates. The quantity should be increased as it was a bit too little. Overall a good experience with some improvements which could easily move the rating to excellent.
4
Lovely food, and excellent service. Great for business lunches. Cosy atmosphere which is a respite from often crowded places in Raffles Place.
4
great italian food in a cosy and nice ambience. Suitable for both business and casual meals. Recommended to try if in vicinity!
4
This would be an excellent restaurant to bring business guests. The ambience and the food are replete with sophistication and will make a good impression.
5
The waiter made us feel right at home ! He kept bantering and he told us about all the other restaurants they have. Food was good too. Restaurant a bit empty. The degustation menu is more worth it than the a la carte though.
4
The quality of the food and of the service is excellent, nothing to say, but it is also very expensive.
4
We went to lunch, and were very pleased. Everything is tasty and simple. Staff are polite and friendly. I recommend
5
Nice place for dinner, the place was quite and the service quite attentive. Great italian food with quality ingredients. Bit pricy but u pay for the quality that u get.
4
Food was excellent, well prepared. Fantastic in fact. Nice ambience. Came for lunch but was a little disappointed at having to ask for the lunch set menu.... wouldn’t most lunch customers expect a set menu to be routinely offered???!! No need for other menu at lunch time as set was superb!!!
5
Classic, authentic Italian food of impressive quality. We had the Hokkaido scallop that was beautifully done, delicious bronze dye spaghetti with octopus and possibly the best Italian seabass we’ve ever had. Ended the meal with a nice Ferrero rocher dessert and moved on for drinks at the bar. Overall an excellent classic Italian restaurant in the heart of CBD and a perfect spot for business dinners
2
Came here recently and was disappointed with the high pricing relative to the quality. 2 small pastas for $80 at lunch is just not good value for money. Although the food was tasty enough, the price is extortionate for what you get. We were still hungry afterwards and ended up having to supplement somewhere else. There are far better value Italian restaurants in Singapore (admittedly perhaps not in this location). We were astounded by how many people were in the restaurant at lunchtime, although most of them were probably on corporate expense accounts and perhaps didn't really care about the prices as a result. Not a venue to go to if you're paying for yourself
5
Amazing food and nice selection of wine.. testing menu is value for money. We had 6 course 108$ and service explain each course. The chef come to the table too for explain some of the dishes
1
Bill came out to 200+ per person including degustation menu and drinks. I don't mind paying money for good food but the food didn't even taste that great except for one scallop appetiser.
5
I had such a great time here with My friends with a delicious dinner ,perfect wine pairing and polite service!must try the Special Degustation Menù!
5
I would recommend anyone to come and have an amazing dinner with professional staff and quality food!well done!
5
Nice service, Good food. Well coordinated place of eating and relaxation. P.s. Hostess Kavitha is really nice
5
Come often for business lunch & great wine. Ambiance is good with attentive staff. The place to be Osteria Art!

We had dinner and drinks at the bar. The taste of the food was excellent, but the portions for the price were tiny. About the size of a small tapas plate, if. (Not all tapas are created equal, despite the concept.) Let me give the detail of our experience. We had an order of the Hokkaido Scallops. (Note the menu and the receipt said scallops, not scallop.) The dish was one scallop (we counted, more than once) for $29!!!We also ordered the white asparagus. Again, one asparagus (or should that be asparagi?) for $28!! When I order asparagus in any other restaurant, or pick it up in my grocery store, there is always more than one, even with white asparagus. There are either many spears (in a restaurant) or a bunch (in the grocery store). The one spear served to us was cut up into pieces (still did not make us feel better).In addition, we were expecting both dishes to be served hot, or at least warm. They were not, so that was a surprise, but we were hungry, so we did not question. It was well beyond the typical dinner hour when we arrived (receipt says we closed out our bill at 21:34.)It was probably a sign, but when we came in, there was no one in the restaurant and when we sat at the bar, the bartender (from Italy) did not seem too enchanted that we were there and took a while to greet us. (I am guessing the restaurant, due to lack of business, was hoping to close early.) But, we were hungry. Later on we got him to warm up a bit, but we should not have had to try so hard. That's his job.It was an expensive experience, and we were on vacation, but we would not go back. A shame, because it would take so little (larger portions, friendly service, proper temperature) to make this restaurant really, really good. Tisk, tisk
5
Went there for the second time and the food was excellent!! I tried few Italian restaurants in Singapore but this is the best!!! Nice service, incredible good food, relaxing atmosphere,nice deco. Chef Andea explained us some of the dishes, that gave a nice touch to our dinner!! well done! Otherwise location is not nice, difficult to find a carpark after the Golden Shoes clos
4
The atmosphere is classy, with a nice bar at the entrance and comfortable chairs. Waiters were friendly, informative and entertaining, but left us alone for quite a while in the beginning. It would have been nice to get a menu to order drinks and starters even though our group was not yet complete. But this is definitely a nice place for a special occasion, though a bit pricey.
5
Great food with a professional service staff! They take the time to explain every dish that comes to the table. Even the chef greeted us even though he must be busy!The Special Menu was amazing, you have to give that a try! We will definitely recommend our friends and come back for more
5
My 8 time visiting this establishment. Excellent food, fast service and fresh produce. This is an excellent place for a business lunch.
5
This is a perfect place for a date or hangout. Ambience was good and with great service. will definitely come back to try others on the menu!
5
loved the crab and lobster pastas. the service here was exceptionally great, even though it was a packed room, with a fine dining atmosphere, and we did not get the dresscode memo and came in shorts and slippers. would come back again, better dressed haha
3
We ordered the sea urchin pasta and crab pasta. Wasn't impressed by it. However the ambience there was great with great services too
4
Good service, good food & good location except most times, it tends to be too noisy, especially during lunchtime.
5
The most consistent Italian food in Singapore - top with fantastic service. Great set lunch menu and reasonable wine list which is always a find i SG.
4
Ambience of the restaurant was very nice, food was decent, but a little expensive for the price. Service was definitely fantastic though!
5
Went for business meeting and decided to revisit. It didn't disappoint me. Served fine food (set lunch with 3-course), what to ask for? They took care of my bad allergy too. Crews showed staff competency.
4
I should have checked a bit more before deciding on the venue for lunch with my wife. Osteria Art is a fancy looking restaurant and situated near Raffles Place it attracts (obviously) the business crowd. It was almost full for the lunch service and there was a good vibe in the place, however the place is not well designed for acoustics. The ceiling is very low and tables are very near to each other (which isn't always an issue), with all tables having (I think) interesting conversations the "noise-pollution" was extreme. You couldn't even hear the music they were playing on the background. There are many up-market restaurants in that area that most likely have a more private and quieter ambience. But let's focus on the food as well .......one word ....Amazing! According to my wife the best crab pasta she ever had in Singapore. Huge portion (a la carte), well balanced and pasta cooked just right! So don't bring your date or expect a romantic lunch date here if you want atmosphere. Not sure what the crowd is like in the evening .....
5
I was here to celebrate my first year wedding anniversary, and it was an amazing experience. Mags, my faithful server for the evening, noticed a flower I was carrying, and enquired what occasion it was. Thereafter, he proceeded to suggest that the chef could create something not in the menu for our special occasion! We were seated in the middle of the restaurant, and both servers, without collaborating, came to tell me that if the group of ladies taking the corner booth left, they will prepare for us to move over - more privacy they said. Of course I was bowled over by how much attention and care was given to us.Course by course, they took time to converse, about life, the food, and us, and we really felt like VVIPs there. Excellent food by the chef, excellent service, and excellent celebration for our anniversary. Definitely coming back
4
The food was amazing, the pastas were fresh and the sauces were flavourful. The service was excellent.
5
Servers will give you more options catering to your preference. Offer us good choices and made the decision for us. Satisfied with the meal as a whole. And thumbs up for their service.
4
They did customisation of menu as per request. 4-course lunch meal was good with a little downside on the overly salted tagliata beef. Despite this, scallop, truffle tagliatelle, tiramisu were exquisitely decorated and fit the taste bud well.
4
Food was definitely good. Very generous with the Truffle flakes when i ordered a pasta. It was rather pricey though but definitely wort paying for. Not a fan of the tiramisu
5
Excellent food and the staff were efficient. It's on the pricier side so be prepared to spend. But the price is worth the food
4
Celebrated 2 very special occasions with my partner here. The food is amazing and the waiters are mostly from Italy and all speak with a strong italian accent which really gives the place the authentic ambience. Food is really really amazing, and the desserts are truly out of this world. Definitely a must go
4
I came here for a coffee with a friend, and it was a very ideal place as the location is central, it is quiet so it was cozy and private, I must try the food next time. The high chairs at the bar is quite comfortable, the selection of wine seems great and I love the 1920s decor
3
I felt torn writing this review. First of all, my company held an event here and the service was slow. 2nd time I came was a private appointment with my friends for dinner to celebrate any partner's birthday and the service staff was again slow to respond or they were just generally aloof. The services was cold and without any human touch. The food was amazing, I must say. I ordered lamb and it was so yummy ! The beef was really delicious as well. For the quality of food, it's a 5 star; for the service, it's a 3 star. Ambience and comfort: 4 star.Will I go back again? I will for the food but if it's a first date or anniversary, I will not recommend.
5
Went there for dinner and i choose the set menu, it was Amazing.Small portion but well presented high quality ingredients.The prawn very tasty, lobster pasta perfectly cooked and the cod fresh and delicate. Dessert was nice too.Not so expensive considering the quality of the food. I will definitely suggest this place
3
The food is average and not the best I have ever had but the prices are unbelievable.This is one of the most expensive restaurants I have ever eaten. There are not many places in the world that would even think of charging US$154 for a small steak. For that price I want to have a personal relationship with the cow before it is slaughtered. Eat somewhere else. Singapore is a great city for food. Avoid pretentious ovepriced places like this
5
Great service.. luckily i asked for a quiet corner as the original seats were between 2 big groups of people..
5
I alway here for wine, huge selection of Italian wines. They recommend good food goes along with my pairing.
5
This restaurant turned out to be more atas than expected. food was good and service was great too. however the price was on the higher end. might come for special occasions
4
Service is excellent despite the crowd in the restaurant. We went for the power lunch set. Decent portion and value for money!
Place is noisy due to the crowd but conversation is still possible.
4
Ordered tuna tartare for starters which was 8/10. Had the crab tagliolini for mains 8/10. Overall enjoyable experience with attentive staff except for minor blunder when they brought out the wrong pasta type for my colleague. Remedy was swift & no bad aftertaste as a result. Mostly business lunch crowd hence expect lots of chatter
2
recommended some friends to go to osteria art for lunch as i've had an enjoyable lunch there in Feb. friends arrived earlier and were not offered set lunch menu as an option and recommendations suggested by waiter seemingly without much thoughts, eg. duplicated in flavour, (in feb when i was there a slightly elderly distinguished gentleman was able to listen to our requests and provided well put together recommendations from the ala carte menu. for this visit, prices were not made known upfront for specials. a friend was recommended the white asparagus for starter $48++ and cod (which also came with white asparagus, with a ave tasting n overly salty fish priced at $58++). was an extremely disappointing and unpleasant experience such that the group decided to adjourn elsewhere for dessert and coffee to not be further ripped off.
5
If you thinking of a go to place for dinner, I will highly recommend Osteria Art at 55 Market Street. Great food with a stunning decor and very attentive staff and not forgetting the excellent food and choices they had to offer. We will definitely be back!!
5
I was here for dinner last Saturday. The restaurant look stunning very classic, especially the lights deco. The service was attentive, we were greeted with a warm welcome. We enjoyed couple of fantastic cocktails at the bar before our dinner. Then a gentleman bring us to our table. The Manager came and recommend special items and help us create a nice romantic dinner with wine pairing. We enjoyed Belgium white asparagus as a starter, follow by Homemade tagliolini with Alaskan King Crab.I had a beautiful halibut and my partner enjoyed Tajima Wagyu beef, last but not least a nice dessert included in the menu which surprise us. Overall we enjoyed our dinner even if the price is little expensive !!!! Bravo!!
5
Was there with a business meeting last week. Really good location and the quality of food and service was absolutely wonderful. This is an excellent business lunch spot. A bit pricey but if you want to impress a client - this is definitely the place to take them
4
Food was served promptly and waiters were attentive. Although when we tried to use 3 Entertainer vouchers we were only able to use 2 when we called for the bill. The waiter who took our order said we could use 3, yet the lady who settled our bill denied it. We tried to explain to her but she just kept insisting that we could only use a maximum of 2 vouchers. I would suggest that the restaurant inform diners before ordering and also not to give contradictory instructions. This is not very professional..
3
They had excellent service! However the food was not up to my expectations especially with that price.
4
Attentive service, well informed service staff. Refined Italian food with atypical dishes. Not your comfort food type of thing. Good for a night out after work.
5
Great location .. good service & best food ..
We have reserved the place & food was customised based on our requirements by Mr. Nickson. We enjoyed our lunch very professional. Bravo!!
4
Went for my bday celebration. Used entertainer one for one plus we ordered a set dinner. Food was good although quite pricy. Waiters were friendly, a little too chatty.
5
Great food and service here at osteria art! Had a great dining experience! Will definitely be back for more! :))
4
Good food & wine coupled with exceptional service. Thanks, Evita and Jeet, for the lovely dinner experience. We'll be back.
5
I was here with my Friend. The service was very professional. The staff explain about dishes, good recommendations. Best classic cocktails we had. Worth it for the price and the quality. Especially Crab Canolo was amazing. I appreciate when Chef induced him at our table with very humble and professional. We will come back ...
4
What impressed us most at Osteria Art was the service – friendly but professional, and never intrusive. The food was stellar for the most part, too – opt for the four-course set meal, which is value-for-money considering how premium some of the ingredients are. Will definitely return.
5
Coming from a fan of il Lido, the standard of this place doesnt suprise me, neither does it disappoint. The service is impeccable and the food brings me fond memories of il Lido. Great food, decent portions and the pastas are always perfectly dished out. Excellent place for a nice dinner. Love it.
4
Nice place for lunch. Comfortable seating. Enjoyed my dish of papardelle pasta in braised pork cheek and red wine sauce. Nice ambience. Good service. Servers could help to cut the bread served at start as it was messy to cut it up ourselves over business lunch. Earl Grey tea was a bit too light. Overall worth coming back again
4
A nice and cosy place for business lunch. The bread (starter) is soft but would have preferred it to be cut and served in a basket because it is relatively messy for us to share the bread (with business associates).
5
Affordable fine dining restaurant operated by the famed restaurateur behind Sentosa's IlLido Restaurant. Nice, cosy area in the middle of the bustling CBD. Fantastic food, great wine! And best of all, there's AMEX Platinum Credit Card promotion :)
5
The staff were very friendly and explained their dishes well. The recommended dishes were of high quality and tasted great! I highly recommend the crab pasta!
5
Service was very attentive.
The freshly baked bread was crusty and warm.
The portion size for the lunch set was good but the pan fried seabass too salty
4
The most delectable dishes here are the pastas; others are good but less brilliant. Always full at lunch, when service may suffer as the otherwise professional waiters can be overwhelmed and forgetful.
5
nice food and great place for family and business, will probably suggest my people and will go back again for my next business meet up
4
Another pleasant surprise in my journey to sensualize my palate when I visited Osteria Art last night. The pasta caught my attention immediately and I told the manager that it was exactly how pasta should taste like, Italian style. The pasta was chewy, bouncy and fresh, and the sauce thick and just enough to cover the pasta. The shaved black truffle on top of the pasta was my favorite way of cooking pasta. I will have it whenever available. The best I had was in Florence. The lobster Tagliolini was spicy, creamy and rich which brought summer to me early. The lobster meat taste was clear and buttery. The caviar, one of my favorite besides truffle and foie gras, provided the rich, sweet and savory taste to the raw prawns. The Hokkaido scallop was done exactly how it should be cooked to maintain maximum for freshness and the sauce did not overwhelm the sweet and creamy taste. The black cod was one of my favorite fish together with Blue Fin Tuna and Chilean Sea bass. Its succulent and tender meat was best served with minimum sauce. The nutty and creamy sauce of the Romanesco sauce did a fine job in this regard. The fatty and silky melt in your mouth foie gras was heavenly good but the quail was slightly charred
5
What a great place.It's tastely decorated, the staff are friendly and efficient - our waiter knew the menu and could happily explain the specials and the al a carte.what's surprising:1. Interesting well designed sauces2. hand made pasta3. great ambiance4. super serviceI left feeling well cared for, well fed and relaxed
1
Have not seen such bad service in the longest time. It wasn't even just from 1 server, but an all-around, unpleasant service experience. Bummer. And the portion is minuscule. The pappardelle red wine pasta & desserts (apple crumble tart & tiramisu) were great though. The rest of our 3 main courses- the veal chop, lamb rack & black cod were average. Will highly NOT recommend
5
Went there for lunch and had the wild mushroom and truffle pasta, although small it was delicious and had plenty of truffle. Apple tart with ice cream for dessert was good too. Service was extremely attentive and very polite. Will definitely go back for the pasta again
4
Not my first visit to this great place. Food is always good, atmosphere always pleasant and the service always professional. Highly recommend it.
5
Very personable services with good food selection. Great place for celebrations and other major events. Place was quiet yet cosy, perfect for gatherings. Would come again.
5
We ordered the scallops and beef sirloin, both turn up to be quite tasty. The portion of the antipasto is really tiny. They were Super busy during lunch and service was slow too.
4
Classy Italian with outstandingly attentive service. Food was good but not as much of a standout as the service. Pricey - but going by the crowd, very well patronized!
4
This has become one of my favorites ever since it opened. Both the food and the attentive service are worth the visit
5
Osteria is a quiet place tucked away in the corner. We love the pasta here. Portions are on the small side though. Great for dates with soft lighting.
3
Food portions are very small and prices are considered expensive. Certainly won't recommend this restaurant.
4
My wife and I recently had a late weekday lunch at Osteria Art. We arrived close to 2pm and the restaurant was still more than half full - in fact, we had to wait a brief moment for them to turn around the tables following the previous lunch seating. They had a tasting and a la carte menu - as this was lunchtime for us, we opted for 2 pastas from the a la carte menu (around S$35 each before tax and service charge). This was not cheap by Singapore lunch standards but the food was of a high quality and standard. Portions were not huge but just right for a decent lunch. Service was attentive and cordial, but not excessively friendly and over-the-top.This is a good Italian restaurant in the very heart of the CBD, just round the corner from the Raffles Place MRT

Went for lunch, had the set meal, portions small but good, just nice for a small eater, need advance booking for week day lunch, restaurant doesn't serve gluten free pasta. It has outdoor & indoor dining. Cozy dÃ©cor but instead of those ugly wall lights, art pieces would fit better to complete the ambience of the place

My expectations were pretty low having read a lot of the reviews of this restaurant - over-priced, poor service etc. It is on the pretentious side but the service would appear to have improved since those previous reviews or maybe I have more realistic expectations from Singapore restaurants? But either way, food came with minimum of fuss, though they were slow to refill our water and the bread was deposited as two loaves without being separated into sections for each diner, more a kitchen issue in my view. The power lunch menu is reasonably priced and decent value for SGD35, food was nicely executed though a little lacking in salt and portion sizes were sensible without being skimpy. The atmosphere is this place is too fussy for my tastes (much more a bistro kind of person) but it isn't bad for a white table cloth option in this part of the CBD - would still go to Zafferano instead though..

One of the best pasta in Singapore I would say! Came with Italian friends and they confirmed that the pasta are those kind that bring back childhood memories. Not enjoying the steak and very disappointed of dessert, it seems like industrial quality.
1
Never going back as the service is terrible. The staff are not responsive and they have a bad attitude. The starters are nice but overall the food is just decent and definitely not worth the price nor the experience of putting up with shoddy service
4
Service was awesome at Osteria Art and the food was delicious! Portions were a bit on the small side though.
5
Blink and you'll miss it. But it's definitely worth seeking it out because the food is amazing! It's a little on the pricey side but overall worth every penny because they provide you with a very high quality of food and attentive service.
5
Great services and place they are staff was fantastic I love this we are enjoyed they are staff. I would be soon there again.
4
One would not expect to find such quality cooking in the CBD, especially in the 'old' part of the business district, opposite Golden Shoe car park. Professional service. May not yet be a masterpiece, but certainly commendable art.
5
Love the ambience here, very cozy and classy. The set lunches are also a good meal if you need to lunch with business associates.
5
The ambiance of the restaurant is classy and quiet. Great for romantic dates and dinners with conversations. My wife felt like having a different pasta from what was available in the menu, and the chef obliged by whipping up a special cream based crab pasta specially for her! My beef sirloin was divine as well, not forgetting the freshly baked bread to start off the meal.Overall, the service was excellent and we thoroughly enjoyed our date at Osteria Art

Location: Centrally located - within walking distance from the Raffles Place MRT.Service: Very AverageFood: Very AverageAmbience: So so.Three of us were there for lunch on a Thur. All ordered the Set Lunch - Power Lunch menu. So the order should be simple to take. Two of us ordered the Penne with Beef Cheek...however, after a long wait, when the food came, we were given some roast pork ribs instead. No introduction when it was served. Well, since we waited for quite a bit for the food, we were thinking if we should call the waiter and check with him if this is "Penne with Beef Cheek". But we didn't as they seemed to be rushing around and we really did not want to wait for another 30 mins for them to change the food (our mistake). Anyway, the pork ribs was way way too salty. No one came to check how the food was until when they collected the dishes. They asked how was the food - I guess as a matter of routine - so I told them that the pork was very salty; reply was just "Oh, is it. Let me tell them". Haha.So overall, I would rate the service and food as just very average and in fact closer toward the poor end.We were seated toward the front, just after the bar counter/cashier - there seem to be a hidden room behind the wall, and if you are seated near the hidden door (where we were placed) and when the staff opens the door, you actually get a cold gust of wind suddenly. Need to be mindful where you are seated and let them know if you want to avoid the sudden gust of cold wind blowing into you.The lamps mounted on the wall (not the ceiling lamp) are glass-encased with sharp edges - since the lamps are mounted at the head-level, one need to be careful to avoid knocking against one of these sharp edges.

I wish to thank all of the people involved in making this complimentary dinner extended to me by Il Lido from last year after my ROM in Mar. Being part of the group, Osteria did not fail to surprise me with their hospitality and generous services even though we are there for complimentary dinner. You have made it even special for us as we are there to celebrate our anniversary too. The food quality and taste was equally great and delicious from my last taste at Il Lido. Even the bread was so cute and delicious we had to be so thick skin to ask for 2nd servings. I really enjoyed their concept of being such a fine dining place but with such homely and welcoming services. Considering that I am pregnant, the manager even offered to exchange any dishes that I deem not fit to my taste - this is really a kind gesture, have not come across any restaurant that would do that - to think that it is complimentary. My husband and I really enjoyed our dinner to the max and the happiness stayed with us through the night that we shared with our family when we went home. Thanks again to everyone who made it such great experience for us once again. This Il Lido group concept should be maintained to other restaurants too. I look forward to visiting other restaurant within the group. :

Food was fantastic. Service impeccable. The staff paid lots of personal attention despite it being a busy Friday evening, plying us with drinks and making us laugh til we fall off our seats.
Will definitely be back.
5
Gotta love the ambiance and staff has recommended good wine to go with the food. I had beef and it was done to perfection. Will be back.
4
Good food, great ambience, friendly service. Do dress up a little for this place. You will meet all sorts of people here, from couples on dates, to girls night out dinners, to business peeps hanging out.
4
Great ambience dining here, set lunch was great too. But remember to book early, otherwise would have to sit at the bar area with high chairs which was not too comfortable.
4
Had a very lovely birthday dinner at Osteria Art with my family. Beautiful ambience and excellent service. Food quality is good.
5
Food was delicious and well presented. We ordered 3 mains to share between 2 of us and they offered to spilt each dish.
3
Nice Ambience plumb in middle of business district in unexpected corner of market street. Food variety is interesting but quality is average. Be wary of the slick waiter (straight out of Italian job) trying to offer you fancy options, it could give your wallet a shock. We were shocked at having to question the complex billing (this was not part of that menu, so to customize I subtracted 10, added 40 and gave free coffee, go figure). Negotiating the bill twice over was the least expected experience in a fine dining place
3
The food is good but the service is terrible. I am sure that the management has not trained the young waiters at all. All they know is to bring the food from the kitchen and put them on the table. Not a single words from them. Disappointing! Even the older waiters do not seem to care about their customers. Much for improvement.Considering the food, it is good except for the fish (cod).
5
Went there for lunch. The restaurant has 3 sections, the inner section has very nice ambience and it was usually fully booked. The 2nd section is the bar section with high tables and chairs and bar counter serving a great variety of wine. The outer section is just outside the restaurant without the air conditioning. The food is fantastic and very delicious. Once I tried the pasta with crab meat as recommended by the waiter. It was very delicious. The next occasion, I tried the pasta with sea urchin, it was so fabulously delicious. The beef slices was also very good. So is the crab meat appetizer. I tried the tiramisu dessert too. It was really good and delicious
5
Have been wanting to visit this place for a long time. Came here with girl friend to finish the week off on a high note. We were probably 20 min late but our table was available & ready. My friend wanted to have one drink outside first & the maitre'd gladly obliged. We were a starter & a main each, the ingredients were fresh & the portion just right. We ordered two glasses of red wine to go with our meal but it tasted a bit flat and they happily replaced with two new glasses. We shared a dessert Ferrero Rocher, it was divine. Was definitely be back.
5
Good food and impeccable service. Waiter is very attentive, and the quality of food is good.
Will definitely return in the near future.
4
Good food for lunch. Make sure you get a booking for lunch because the crowd comes from the bankers working around the area.
5
I chanced upon this after gym and was pleasantly surprised by its ambience, service, tasty food and affordable pricing.Entrees and pasta around $20-35.I had a glass of La Massa which had a nice bouquet and a good aftertaste much like Merlot.The white asparagus with guanciale was light and fresh.The tagliolini with crabmeat was excellent. The pappardelle with pork cheek would satisfy those that enjoy fat but if you prefer healthy then finish the pasta but leave pork behind.Both tiramisu and ferrero rocher are must-try desserts

There’s something curious about Beppe de Vito’s venture on Market Street. ‘Value for money’ and ‘CBD’ aren’t usually mentioned in the same sentence, but de Vito’s new fine dining restaurant bucks that convention. At Osteria Art, he puts out the Italian food he’s known for – you must have heard of ilLido, &SONS and Southbridge – without inducing too much pain if you’re not swiping the company card.This osteria – Italian for a restaurant that serves simple meals – takes cuisine classics and updates them with modern techniques in à la carte, lunch and dinner menus. It’s not a place to take clients to if, like us, you make blissed-out faces around good food. Not rolling our eyes back in ecstasy when we crack into a communal boule-like loaf is our first challenge: the bread remains crisp outside and fluffy inside – even after we’ve successfully guarded attempts by the servers to take it away.Appetisers bring a wave of lovely aromas to the table. A velvety flan of earthy porcini, and headily scented truffle and leek velouté ($22) wins the round of orders. The Bollito Misto soup ($23), which floats tender cuts of pork, veal, beef and chicken in a clear broth, is another triumph. They make the simpler but well-executed plates of burrata, grilled vegetables and 25-year-old balsamic ($23), and a one-note yet mains-sized crab frittata ($23) dim in comparison.Address: 55 Market St, 048941Hours: Closing soon · 12–2:30PM, 6–11PMPhone: 6877 693

The environment is upscale and you will immediately feel as though you are in a restaurant in Italy. My friend and I did not make any reservations so had seats at the bar. We started with warm bread, shared a Buratta Salad, my friend had the Chef's Special - Uni Pasta, the last serving available. This is not on the menu, with limited servings and diners will only know on the day itself if there are any available. I had the Tagliolini With Crab And Pachino Tomatoes. We ended our rich and decadent lunch with her having Ferrero Rocher and an expresso, while I had the Osteria Art Tiramisu. It was even sweeter as she paid with AMEX and we had a 50% discount
4
Came here with compliments from my mentor. Wine was perfect with the cheese platter. My food was uni pasta which was abit "gelat" towards the end but it was sharing portion so it was manageable. Foie gras dish was memorable and given the impeccable service, I would return for sur
5
Fantastic! Had the tuna tartare and the crab salad! Both wonderful! My only complaint was that I couldn't taste the truffle in the tuna. For mains, we had the octopus pasta and the kale fettuccini and venison ragu. The octopus pasta was perfect with fork tender octopus and delicious pasta, the kale fettuccini not bad. Service prompt and efficient. 4 stars for the food and service! the additional star for the 50% discount using palate card
4
We were here on a quiet Monday evening. My third time here and service was still excellent. We had the UOB card promotion 4 course set menu plus coffee or tea which was 50% off at $60, well worth it. There was a choice of roasted quail or fish for main course. Everything tasted good including the crab meat pasta. We also ordered the prosciutto ham appetizer which was yummy. Corkage was $50 per bottle for BYO. Ambience very nice and posh, but not snobbish if you know what I mean. Good place for hanging out with friends or colleagues.
5
Had really excellent evening with three gfs tonight. Two of us had the $98 four course set menu unlimited prosecco or martinis. The cauliflower cream and crab salad starters were delicious. Additional starter of calamari was tender and fried just right. Hand made pasta with scampi, mains of sirloin, sea urchin pasta and sea bass were all tremendous and final desserts were all from a kitchen that wants you to have an exceptional dining experience. Waiters, Suraz and Louis worked hard and humorously to keep us wined and dined...a very nice evening..but make reservations..you'll need to.

Dined here 3 times now. It's a nice fine dining experience with nice food.go for the $35 2 course set menu with tea or coffee. Really nice business environment to have a lunch conversation. Really good service and attentive staff.Maybe avoid the extras like wine and bottled water as the cost will go up quite significantly if you are on a budget.Food: 4/5Service: 5/5 - like fine diningAmbiance: 5/5 - like fine dining, good for business.Price: 4/5 - just avoid the extras.

Went there with my old colleague for a general catch up. We chose the set menu which was quite delicious actually. However the portion was quite small compare to the price it was charged. Service as quite good as well
4
We enjoyed a special degustation menu and tried 8 courses over a three hour dinner. Amazing! The service was attentive and friendly while we tasted each delicious course. Would recommend!
4
Classic Italian restaurant in Raffles Place. Menu, decor and service all impeccably tasteful, but maybe a little too corporate and conservative for some modern diners.
4
Went recently after opening so I am sure the kinks in service and drinks have been ironed out.
Food was ok but found most under-seasoned and not really wow in terms of presentation
4
Very arty deco, great location near Raffles Place MRT. Good lunch sets, delicious and quick to serve too. Although the restaurant lost my reservation even though I booked a month in advance, so had to sit at the bar area. Best to reconfirm your reservations ahead.

Had lunch with 2 business partners and we ordered the quick fix ~ set lunch. The options are limited but reasonably priced for set lunch, comparing to other similar outfits. I paid extra for the foie gras as starter and it was not too bad. Quite a decent piece served. For main, I went for the pork belly but the skin was so hard I could hardly cut with my serving knife. Etiquette aside, I had to end up using my hands as the crackling skin was what I would die for! Not too bad, still a little hard. Nothing compares to those served in the chinese restaurants. Skip the pineapple dessert as I don't have sweet tooth. Actually took a small bite to try the taste ~ awfully sweet for me. Skipped!The ambience is decent for business discussion, if nothing too confidential as the tables are set quite near to each other (well I guess this applies to most restaurants as they want to max out their area). I could actually hear my next table, they were not loud and if I intently listen, I believe I could hear their conversation. Service was fast when asked but lacking in attention. I think I saw only 3 service staff manning the whole restaurant. Will I return? Definitely as it is conveniently located near to my partners and the place is indeed quite nice to dine in.
5
went for dinner on a friday evening, were greeted promptly and made to feel welcome from the start. enjoyed excellent service from Suraj the manager, who gave us great recommendations and was hospitable to no end. timing between each course was perfect, food was amazing, martinis are out of this world
5
Restaurant looks exquisite and classy when entered though full bar was at frontage. Liked the plushy feel but ceiling was a little Low for comfort. Was served and brought to table immediately by reception. Service rendered was prompt and explained different types of courses and items in menu. Very attentive indeed. Had calamari with squid ink as antipasti, pork cheek pasta and crab pasta as mains. All equally wonderful and recommended. Ordered Apple tart for dessert and tasted great. Overall the meal service was thoughtful and they changed cutlery for every course which I like
5
I have to confess that I was attracted to the restaurant by their “BYO Saturday” where corkage is waived. I figured that they needed some promotion to bring customers to the middle of the financial district on a Saturday night. The promotion must have been successful as the restaurant is well-patronised.I’m not an expert on Italian food to say whether it’s authentic, but you wouldn’t find the usual suspects of Italian food like spaghetti carbonara or pizzas there. The dishes sounded unfamiliar and exotic but everything was tasty.Only complaint was the “daily special” beef steak that we ordered for sharing. While the taste was good, by the time the steak was craved and served to us, it was cold.Service was great too. The waiters happily brought out the decanters and wine glasses despite no corkage policy.I hope that they continue to keep corkage free Saturdays; we’ll be back for that and the food. So bring a bottle if you do eat there on Saturdays
5
I'm Italian and it's not easy to find good Italian food in Singapore. Osteria Art is the Italian restaurant where I have eaten the best food in Singapore! Everything was fresh and yummy! It's not a cheap restaurant, but if you desire to eat authentic and delicious Italian food you have to go there
4
I am personally not a huge fun of Fine dining so I should have know when I came ...nothing impressive, quality ingredients should be better. Staff attentive .
4
Very good service and very reasonable cost for special lunch menu. Good wine selection and generally good atmosphere. Food was very tasty as one can see it was freshly prepared.
4
The presentation of cuisine was good and impressive. Taste was normal but the service delivery made it perfect in all. Location is good as it is easily accessible. Restaurant seating capacity limited.

I made my second visit during lunch on a weekday. There was a set lunch but I opted for the Cod Fish and shared appetizers (crab and avocado with ikura salad, tuna tartare) and enjoyed it very much. Just on the food quality itself, it's pretty good - my favourite was the crab and avocado salad. The cod fish came with scampi and sauce that was much like lobster bisque. Even the coffee is pretty good (I don't usually enjoy coffee in restaurants). Our waiter was great too. He's from Spain and he obviously is passionate about food and what he does. He was always thoughtful, giving me a side plate for some courses so that I can share with those who ordered something). It's a little pricey especially if you take ala carte but for a yummy and pleasant experience, I am glad to visit once in a while or on a special occasion. During lunch on weekdays, they seem a little busy so do tell them if you need quicker service
4
My party of four (two couples) had a great evening. We were celebrating the birthdays of the husbands. Firstly, all of us love the Italian-New York vibe. The food was beautiful, the dishes recommended to us were executed to perfection and tasted amazing. The wine list was impressive, it boosted quality (and expensive) wines from Europe. The bottle of red we ordered was superb. Last but the least, the team was friendly and attentive.To add, a good bartender! Why? The wives ordered some Hendricks prior to dinner. The G&T was served with organic tonic and more importantly, cucumber! Need I say more?
3
I heard good stuff about Osteria Art and was v eager to try their lunch . Smart decor , great service staff , good food - lunch is good value too . But I find the dining tables too close together and I can't have a good conversation - be it business or with friends . The bar area seemed better - perhaps I should have asked for it . Maybe drinks at the. At would be more conducive 
5
We came here with a large group. All the dishes we had were very good. They have fusion dishes like pasta with sea urchin and suckling pig, which were surprisingly good. I usually avoid fusion food because I'm worried about how it will turn out but they did it very well. Service was friendly and attentive
4
Had lunch w a client, food was good but tables were too close together, cannot really talk much business. Air con in the building broke down so was really warm and stifling. As the restaurant is in a business district they should have some back up perhaps w fans to have some circulation. While the food was good we didn't want to stay long and wanted to quickly got out because of this. Food was really good and waiters attentive, will go back if the air con is fixed.
5
From the smile of the server when I step into the restaurant, down to the food served. Everything was impeccable and great! It was a late Monday night dinner with 2 close friends. They highly recommended this restaurant for my birthday dinner so there we went! I had the pork cheek pasta (forgot the actual name), which I couldn't finish and the server asked if I want to takeaway. Heated it up the following day for dinner and it still taste great! :
5
It was through friend's recommendation that we decided to have our birthday celebration there with a group of friends. We each ordered a pasta / main course and some side dishes to share. The quality of food for most dishes (including pasta) has exceeded our expectations. We were surprised that it was not too crowded on a Friday night, but we truest enjoyed the nice ambience, great services and good food
5
had the power lunch (set) recently and was blown away. Had the sea bass - one of the best I had in many years. The dessert was awesome too! Great value lunch.
5
impeccable service coupled with delicious Italian food. If you're looking for a decent place to bring your clients, try this. Warning: reserve early. Tell the waiter your clients' names. They even address them by name! I'm impressed. They just raised their prices but still not too bad as quality is great!
4
I went here for a business lunch on a busy Friday. One of our guests was in a hurry - the service was pretty fast and efficient. The set lunch was good value at S$35 for three hearty courses. I ate the scallops which was good and a really lovely apple cake. I will be back to try out more of the restaurant.
4
The interior of this restaurant is lovely - a little bit old-world but still stylish and refined. The service was impeccable. We had the power lunch and I especially enjoyed the Burrata and tomato starter. The green tea and chocolate cake for dessert was wonderful too. Bread and candied almonds were a treat. Coffee was divine. Well done
5
Sadly, many of singapore's top restaurants struggle to deliver good food with flawless service, so it's refreshing to go to a place like Osteria Art and have European style excellent service. The waiters know the menu, they have a level of decorum that is uncommon in Singapore, and of course the food is excellent. I look forward to returning
3
Some good parts of the meal and others that just lacked what I had read onlineCocktails average and seemed long in making- Suppose with it being new this will change over time but could be better.Bread was nice. Rest of the dishes lacked wow factor and most of all seasoning. Service was attentiv
4
Very good service, attentive waiting staff professionally executing a good lunch experience. Uni pasta, a special which was not on the ala carte menu ($50) was super creamy and luscious. My husband and friend both had the set lunch which looked very good. Will definitely endeavor to come at least once a month for Uni pasta fix
5
First impression is important and Osteria Art has done a great job. You walk into the restaurant and you get a feel that you are in an upmarket restaurant. Funitures and decor is nice and warm. The lighting is perfect and the sound level also extremely pleasant. You do have a feeling that it will be a very expensive night, but also here did I get a nice surprise. Food, Service and Wine was all in the top end, but prices were VERY reasonable
4
I Visited with my daughters a friend and her son.The welcome was friendly but "serious".The amuse bouche were a bit of a let down ... Probably too long from oven to table.The cocktails (and the bar-lead Josepha) were remarkable home smoked whiskers and flavoured vodkas made for a tantalizing combination of flavours and aromas. The menu was very interesting . We shared a few starter which were all good but the cheese and meats platter was worthy of note.The main dishes were all good I recommend you try the Sea Urchin pasta or the beef & truffle taggelini.The cheese board was very generous and deserts looked (I didn't taste) wonderful.All in all a good evening with excellent food and service. It's a "grown up" version of their rooftop bar Riverwalk. Try Riverwalk for evening casual and Art for a special occasion
5
Went there for the 1st time and loved it. The place looks nice and the staff was very pleasant and caring. Went for the set lunch and the food was delicious. Portions are generous and it does offer great value for money. Was full but staff worked out a way to get us a nice table while waiting for 15mins at the bar which had great service. Fresh baked bread was delicious and it is actually good value for a very nice setting. Will sure be back for more. Well done guys
