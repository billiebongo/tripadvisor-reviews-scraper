diffrent then other dosa place.quick service inexpensive.but food and place ok to go if you like south indian food.
4
Went with my extended family and enjoyed the south India food. Very simple and basic but nice food. For 10 of us, i paid 90sgd. Which is quite decent.
Very tasty food.
3
We went to this place for dinner. Staff was very efficient. Food was delivered within minutes, once the order was taken. Old was South Indian and it was average. Price was very reasonable.
1
We had ordered a meat veg briyani ( mock meat). What arrived was a kid’s portion. We decided to cancel the other order of Appam and asked for the briyani to be packed and gave our feed back. We waited and waited, but they did not give us the briyani that they had taken away to pack. Not wanting to wait any longer, we left. The service is poor. And the portion was a laugh for a $8.40 dish

Having just arrived in Singapore after a longer than expected border crossing from Malaysia, we were hungry. Luckily, this place hit the spot.We ordered the vip thali for $9.90 and found it to be both very filling and delicious. Service was also fast and attentive.It's a popular place so you may need to wait from time to time
5
We sat down, we ate immediately and left very happy. The owner is lovely and will go to great lengths to ensure you enjoy your meal. Order a thali - you'll enjoy all of it and definitely won't go home hungry. The mango smoothie was also delicious
4
The butter dosai is the best I have eaten on earth! Don’t even have to eat with the chutneys. The price is reasonable n the service not bad. Have been to this restaurant more then 10 years ago. Was surprised with the layout n the tasty food served.
5
I’ve been to Singapore on vacation 4 times since 2002 - including last night. I’ve always been impressed. Great food, very friendly and welcoming staff. What is there not to like about this place. If you come to Singapore get your inspiration here before heading off to Mustaphas, a few blocks away, to stock up on authentic Indian ingredients
4
We had a terrible experience at Lagaa Barefoot Dining and left without eating anything. So we just happened to pass by this place, 3 shops away. What a refreshing atmosphere and we felt welcomed by the Rohit and his team there. Excellent Vegetarian Food. We paid $35 (EUR25) in total for 3 lime juice, 1 VIP Thali, 1 Masala Dosa, 2 Roti Prata. 3 Curry Puffs snacks
4
Well, must say that the appoms are actually better ! They are freshly made and served immediately - that's how they are eaten by the way, with a little coconut milk and palm sugar. Vegetarian meals are great with a variety of dosas, vadais, biryani rices, curries, chutneys, etc. I have noticed waiters helping unfamiliar tourists with the menu and what to order. Place could be a bit tidier but this is an incredibly busy place. It is clean no doubt. I would suggest a little friendly hello to the waiters and a whole word of information about the meals becomes available. Yes, they do get bored now and then, but don't we all
2
food was fine, but expensive , lot of pure veg places which serve are more economically priced & serve equally good food
5
I revisited after about 30 years and this place was good as I remember, tasty food, reasonably priced and busy with local people which is always a good sign. We paid about $50 and had a feast. Would definitely recommend this restaurant
4
Even after renovation to put in more seats, increasing price and reducing the portions. It's still the place I would recommend for fresh Indian vegetarian breakfast.
4
Nice restaurant in little india. Vegetarian only foods but tasty. Service is also good. Many local people there. Price is ok around 50$ for a family with 2 teenagers.
5
Our third visit here over the years. Wide choice of dishes, wonderful crisp thin dosa and thalis. Very tasty and fresh dishes. Friendly attentive staff. Manager very welcoming. Always enjoyed the food here so consistent quality. Will visit again next time we're in Singapore.

We had a very bad experience at Madras New Woodlands on Deepavali Eve.The man whom I presumed is the boss claimed we spent 45 minutes there.."You must be very comfortable!"( smiling and in sacarstic tone. Caucasian family before us already seated 1h+ no issues..Caucasian lady next to us..no problem seating alone at table meant for 4 people!Even if your restaurant is crowded we are paying for our food and wanted to have a sweet dessert before ordering our main meals. Is there a time limit to how long you can dine in?The waiter kept taking away our water which we barely drank..we were so thirsty!We had ordered 2 sets of appom and tea then rested for a few minutes to digest before we wanted to eat other stuff..We ordered sambar idli.. and it never came..When I asked why your waiter kept taking away my water, boss replied there's a whole jug there!(smiling again and a lady i think is the daughter also standing there smiling away)I said my cup keeps getting taken away how to drink?My sambar idli order also never came, boss replied each one is different in our own way!!..WTF!!!Boycotting this restaurant from now on..not worth the money eating overpriced food and getting this type of sevice!!I used to frequent this restaurant..was my favourite because I loved the appom.My friend and I left and went to Komala Villas down the road. It was super crowded..max crowd capacity, yet we were not chased away.A smiling boss greeted us and thanked us for our patronage when we left.Such a different atmosphere
5
Fresh crisp Appams made on the spot for breakfast. Authentic, wholesome and simple breakfast. And cheap. It evokes the quiet vegetarian ethos of a classical Madras entrepreneur's desire to serve people by feeding people well. Good place to order food in Tamil and eavesdrop on other people's Tamil conversations !!! Try and go before or around 9 in the morning before the crowds flood in. Not suited for the bagel and cream cheese crowd looking for lattes or herbal teas
5
Ive been going to woodlands for years now, and i have always been more than satisfied. Yesterday's lunch was fabulous, despite being a weekend and fully packed their service was amazing and food was mouth watering. My 3 yr old enjoyed his ghee roast, which was bigger than him :P. A place that i will keep going back too
1
So far I was a regular visitor . Today , while eating my VIP Thali I nearly broke my teeth on a large piece of glass in my food. I was lucky I didn't bite on it or cut myself. Was even more relieved that it wasn't in my girlfriend dish or someone else's. The staff was shocked but there was no further action. When we left I asked for the manager. He didn't really care or seemed disturbed . A little discount was offered but no apologies. Just imagine what could happen if u swallow the glass, or if it happened to a child? Just shocking !

Met my ex-school mates at this Indian Dosa restaurant in little India section of Singapore. It was good to see them there and it was a good time to catch up on life. I ordered the marsala dosa paper thin version. It came in a steel plate with three compartments. The dosa and potato filling was good and so were the dipping veggie curry and sauces. I enjoyed very much and service was pretty efficient but not super attentive. Try the bru coffee (pronounced brew) which is supposed to be a coffee from India. It was delicious and strong. Fortunately the restaurant has a/c so it will be great for tourists. I will come back again should the opportunity arise
1
I went here Just today and it was terrible
The food was so bad, my chapati tasted more like dry dough and the Dahl tasted very Valen and so far it was just ABSOLUTELY
POORLY
TERRIBLE
4
Came back here last week for a paper masala dosa and a prata. Quality continues to be decent with efficient service. Not too busy on a weekday lunchtime. I'm sure I'll be back again.
5
The food at Madras Woodlands is simple yet very yummy. Lots of variety in the menu. Not very spicy too. Location is quite tricky, yet easily accessible.
5
The food was enough.Not too much,not to less.It was tasty in the way that it was freshly cooked and hot
5
This restaurant has the best uppumas for breakfast, and the most amazing north indian thalis for lunch. Everythime I travel back to Singapore, this is a must visit.
3
We dropped in for breakfast around 9:30 am and were surprised to find that most of the items on menu were unavailable. Just dosa, upama and wada. The service was poor and they kept bringing wrong dishes / part of the order. If you happen to drop in, opt to sit in the front, near the serving counters - service is better there. The food was nice and if they improve the service, the business can really do good. Also please pay attention to your bill as they over charge you
4
Someone recommended and we went to try out this place ...Place was known because we visited nearby restaurant nearby e.g. Gokul restaurant so it was not difficult to find it. I can see that Komala's and lagna is also nearby.We tried many dishes there:-Gobi Manchurian-Vada set-VIP thali-Bhatura-One social dosa (don't remember the name)-Tea-AppamAll were simple looking and great in taste and felt light in stomach.The service is very good and all the people were attentive . Especially the owner (I Guess) who speaks multiple languages and has a great sense of talking to various people and suggesting various dishes.Very few South Indian restaurant I found where I could get great taste (not too less or not too much spice) and enjoyed the food.Would visit there again
4
Good food. Clean place. Pure Indian vegetarian restaurant. We went for lunch. Had a VIP set meal. It came with a tiny bowl of white rice and a tiny bowl of briyani rice (which can be replenished) with many other side dishes of different types of curries and vegetables and a piece of chapati. The other meal we ordered was a paper dosai. Crispy. Accompanied by the usual white coconut chutney and the orange tomato chutney and a small bowl of dhal curry. As always the tea with milk was spectacular
3
Had heard a lot of recommendations, which is why I went. The food was average. They were not offering chaat on the day and the South Indian was not as good as others claimed. Had a friend who suggested that the food had deteriorated from her previous visit. Will not go again.
5
The food was quite mouth watering, I really enjoyed the food.. The serving was quite big but it was a really mouth watering experience for my family and I..Suggestion:Do not order more than 1 prata dish as one prata is enough to eat otherwise u are just overeating
5
Enjoyed lovely range of South Indian vegetarian food including Appam, thosai, ideally, Pongal and methu Vadai , attentive waiter and fast service
4
We had puris and vadai which were both delicious. Serving sizes are smaller than expected but it's no problem as prices are low. Woodlands is a good alternative but to my taste not quite as good as Komala Vilas or MTR1924. Your mileage may vary.
4
The food is awesome, especially keerai medhu vadai & bajji, as and wen we order they are made so it is fresh and hot, but the only thing is they are oily... but anyways they taste very good.. the ambiance is good and the price is normal.Remember they accept only cash, no NETS or card.. we had a narrow escape as we had cash :
4
I discovered this Indian Restaurant probably over twenty years ago when we lived in Singapore. It was at the same location serving simply the best Indian style food! Not alot has changed, except there now is a Madras in the name. I only awarded four stars because we didn't receive a detailed bill - only a total to be paid - cash only!
5
This quaint, tucked away, old-school vegetarian restaurant is totally underrated. Their thali meal, appam, ghee dosai, pongal and vadai, and just every single thing is amazing! The food is inexpensive, and yet just plain fantastic! Authentic South Indian food that is reminiscent of the food in India :
4
One of my foodie Friend recommended this place to us. Before visiting this place, we had limited choices for early morning South Indian breakfast. In the allies of Little India we found this very authentic chennai style South Indian snack place. The place is tucked in the middle of upper Dickson road. The Dosa idli and medhu vada were very freshly prepared. The sambar was also very hot and tasty. The chutneys (white coconut sauce and spicy tomato sauce) adds to the overall dish flavour. And the sauces are unlimited. The service is also very nice and the staff serves you with lots of courtesy. So overall a must visit place if you really like chennai style sambar preparation.
4
Family is away and I was walking home after my yoga workshop. I was famished and wanted to stay vegetarian for the weekend. Had a thali for dinner and a rava dosa for lunch. Both were satisfying and made a complete meal, to last me till the next yoga session
4
A great vegetarian restaurant situated in Little India with mouth watering vegetarian meals.I ate their set meal which comes with coffee/tea and a fruit.The set consists of rice,rasam,dal,vegetable curry,yogurt based curry,papad,pickle,pickled chilli,3 kind of vegetable stir fry and a sweet.The waiters give you a feeling that you are in a friend's or relative home.The only setback was no reciepts are issued at cashier and was unsure of the charges.Restraunt is usually crowded during lunch time and the crowd is usually working ppl n family
4
Dined here with my friends on a weeknight for dinner. Ordered onion uthappam, pepper soup, appam and set dosai. The dosai was great and the chutnies were fresh too. In fact we asked for more chutney by the side. The appam was soft and fluffy too! Overall, the food was good and reasonably priced
4
Was there for lunch with a friend and enjoyed it.Good foot traffic of people coming and going which proves that it is a popular restaurant.Food was very fresh , yummy and value for money.Service and warmth of staff was excellent.Had Dosa and Idli sambar with a glass of lassi.Definitely future visit will be a must. Would rate it 8.5 out of 10.......
5
A very simple set up yet good food. We always land here while shopping at little India.must have dosa, coffee, idli.
4
I am visiting this restaurant since 35 yrs and still I feel that they have maintained there taste of food and service . All the items are good and you can buy sweets from them .
4
Saw a review in Strait times and went down to sample the VIP Thali this weekend, and was pleasantly surprised to find a good option to try out if you are in the mood to have a hearty lunch! It's a typical south indian place, a bit crowded but not too bad. This was an unlimited thali with loads of vegetable options, and they keep refilling whichever one you like. You have to just choose between chapati or puri option. The food was tasty enough for us to come back and try their a la carte menu next time! and the Thali was for just SGD 9.50- excellent value for money
5
This is a modest place in Little India - the interiors look like a typical middle South Indian restaurant in India. Service came with a smile and was top class. Being from Kerala, I was delighted to have hot appams for breakfast, served with coconut milk and jaggery. Was yumm. My friend enjoyed the hot poori masala. Tea was verty good too. Would love to return
5
I have been coming to this restaurant for many years now. During my trips from Australia, arriving in Singapore by the 6:30am flight - i would catch a taxi (with luggage) to Madras Woodlands for a fresh, hot and delicious breakfast. Arrive there just as the folks are finishing their morning Pooja. This time, I arrived for a late lunch with my daughters, one of whom ordered a Lunch Thaali and the other a Masala Dosa. The folks at Woodlands were able to allay concerns around some allergies which we appreciated. Delicious, tasty, salt of the earth south indian food. Loved it
4
Came back here today as part of a group of 4 adults and 4 children. It was pretty busy and we didn't have a reservation but fortunately it was possible to bring 2 tables together. We had 8 dosas, some wadas, some lassis and other drinks, all for $65. The kids enjoyed the experience too. Still my preferred venue for dosas in Singapore
2
The price was on higher side, when enquired at the counter, no proper response. Not only that, at home when started to eat, noticed the quantity of the curries given for 2 take aways is equal to one meal, also, more suspect that hot water was added in the curries, because the taste was not original when compared to eat at the restaurant. I won't go back to this restaurant again
4
This Aussie family is semi-adventurous so we read some reviews and sought out a breakfast the locals might eat. We chose a few items based on Trippy's advice and were not disappointed. We especially loved the appam! ( coconut pancake with red coconut sugar). We had lassi to drink ( banana and mango) . The decor is faded and basic, you are not there for ambiance! The service is courteous, the food comes out fast. We spent $24.70 for the 4 of us to sample this and that. A nice light breakfast.
4
I too visit this restaurant often for their reasonable price and personal attention given. Hygiene can be improved. They serve in the south indian traditional way - in a banana leaf always. The service is quite good. Food is moderate taste for the price charged. Even kids can try their meals since nothing is that spicy hot. Can visit with the family though the restaurant is old fashioned
5
Dedicate one breakfast from your stay in Singapore to this lovely traditional Singaporean Indian (vegetarian) restaurant and be prepared to be greeted by warm friendly staff and really delicious food! I recommend sharing the dishes so everyone can have a bit of everything. A typical breakfast for 2 here would consist of the beautiful masala dosa(y) (potato mash wrapped in dosa) and two vada(y) and an appam to share. If there are 4 of you, the bhattura or poori would be good for sharing too. Be sure to have it with milk tea, which comes in a cup which sits in a bowl. The bowl may be used to cool the tea. Pro Tip: do come before 11.30 as the lunch menu consists mostly of rice dishes. The strength of this restaurant lies in their traditional South Indian type dishes as recommended above
4
Don't forget to have the madrasi sweets after heart full of South Indian dosa idli vada and all that stuff . You will remember madras in Singapore
5
I've been coming to this restaurant with my family for the longest time. Don't need the menu anymore. The best appam, rava dosai, masala dosai... Freshly made, friendly crew. You can't go wrong when you see so many regulars.
1
In comparison to the choices available - this one is quite bad...it boasts of a 4.5 rating which might be quite old. Good things is that it is not priced high and the menu is rather simplistic but it ends there.
5
Vanakkam"Today's Special Menu" items are seasonal. Regular items everyone knows what to order or expect. In doubt ask the waiters they will say what they have. Locals can venture to the today's special. Tourists opt for the regular items: Light Eaters - Paper thosai or appam w/ red sugar & coconut Heavy Eaters - Full South-Indian vegetarian set meal Drink- Filter CoffeeSimple, affordable, clean, fast, fuss-free food. Enjoy!
5
Long time Singaporeans told me of this place and after many trips, finally able to enjoy it on a Saturday morning, before the hoards arrived. Great Prata and other breaded items, so tasty with authentic sauces. Staff are friendly and easygoing. Reminder some of the items are finished (sold out) by around 1030a. So get there early for a table and the best. Good luck and enjoy
5
My friend and I went to many Indian restaurants during our stay in Little India. I had some of the best food of my entire life during this time and Woodlands topped them all. The food is absolutely divine and the staff is very friendly. I cannot recommend this place enough
5
My friends couldn't eat all of it, but I like this kind of meal.You can see the huge size of Batura and Dosa.The dishes served will provide you the taste of sweet, sour, and spicy what Indian have.Have a great journey to feel the atmosphere of India!
5
We dined here all 5 days of our stay in Singapore. we tried other veg restaurants, but we were quite satisfied with Madras New woodland's authentic , tasty south indian food. The place is very clean, neat, customer friendly unlike other overrated hotels nearby. our 5 yr old kid enjoyed dining here.We highly recommend this restaurant for both veg north and south indian dishes
5
For traditional South Indian snacks, my favorite restaurant in Singapore. Despite the rise of many newer restaurants, this place retains its quality and homely atmosphere. Expect to see some of Singapore's who's who at the restaurant enjoying the food. Service is simply superb-the staff know many of their customers by their first name
5
Vegitarian Restaurant in the Little India. You can enjoy variety of vegetarian foods here with the aircon. Today we enjoyed breakfast here, masala tosai and masala tea.Very yummy. We tried lunch the other day and it's also tasty. The rest. is very specious and clean. Staff can understand English. Many local people come to have breakfast casually.Lots of spice with foods so you may not used to the taste but recommend to enjoy the real Indian food
4
Good Indian food,easy to find place.Was open at 3:30 pm too unlike many restaurants that close at 2:30 pm.I ordered a South Indian Thani, good taste,super cheap.
5
We had food on most of d days at woodland restaurant n each time we were welcomed by the staff.... They serve with love.. Food quality and taste were awesome.. We tried other places too bt dis was d best.
5
Awesome Food and very nice staff and service. very authentic. Go there if you are around little India.
2
When I arrived I was immediately pounced on by the owner.He was very pushy and essentially trying to force me to spend more money. He keep trying to sell me different and move expensive items, and drinks when all I wanted was a dosa.The Dosa was very soggy and limp and not crispy like I hoped. I was upsold the special and more spicier one, according to the owner, however it was bland and plain. At $4.70 I was not impressed. They are cheaper over the road and you are treated better by the staff.
4
Went at 7:30 am for b/fast and we were greeted with hot piping south indian food. Great tasting. And within 10 min the place was full. So its obvious they are well known esp amongst the south Indians. Cheap food too! We paid less than 20$ for so many items we at
4
This restaurant has the best dosas and vadais in Singapore. The desserts are great too. Have not tried their thalis, but judging from the standard of ther food, I bet its quite good too.I go back there for my dosa fix every couple of months. A must go if you like Indian food
5
This place has been around for a very long time and I finally manage to go . Wish I had done so long time ago . Ordered the rava thosai and appam set. Wow!!!! I guess base on the crowd it's obvious they have a following . Owners are friendly and attentive . The wait for table was not too long . Worth the trip . I will be back !!
4
Had lunch here twice, first had the selection menu, which has a selection of soup, curry, dessert served with bread. Great way to get a taste of all the flavors, as each dish is in a small bowel.Its cheap and the restaurant is air-coned, so eating in the cool is a real pleasure in the afternoon heat.The toilets are clean so is a good reflection of the kitchen
4
I had a great delightful experience here. Its a pure vegetarian restaurant. With decent varieties of south Indian food.Dosas were really tasty and of good quality.Filter coffee was bit of disappointment, it doesn't really smells like filter coffee. Service is really appreciable, because of which i dint feel like visiting other restaurants nearby during my stay in Singapore.
5
Popped in for an early breakfast after shopping at Tekka Market. There's a menu up but the server briefs you on the specials. We had the upma, puri-bhaji (potato veggie), and the paper dosa. All excellent. What we liked were that the portions were the right amount to allow you to try more food without feeling stuffed. And not heavily smothered in ghee. We were early, this area gets very crowded on weekends, so bear that in mind.
4
Looking for authentic Indian in aircon comfort with great service? This is it. Authentic Thalis. Great food & clean surroundings. Unfortunately for some: no alcohol served or permitted. Order the mango lassi instead
3
We expected more because of the very good reviews, though. The food was authentic Indian and ok for a quick lunch. The selection was not so big.
5
My host Mr. Nath introduced me to this place. The service under Mr. Rohit , as Manager, was excellent and he welcomed his customers with a smile and great service with Tasty Food to go with it. Very well prepared Dishes for all Tastes at a reasonable price in Little India, off Orchard Road
5
The food tastes so good... I had the South Indian thali but I guess everything must be equally tasty. Definitely worth the taxi ride. Not expensive at all. Lunch for two persons was SGD 44, I'd like to eat there every day!Owner and staff are friendly and welcoming. Thank you
5
Nestled in the middle of the bustling Little India, this gem serves authentic South Indian food at moderate prices too!The staff are helpful and know their job very well!Excellent for a mid-day meal / lunch. Do try the South Indian meals there served on a banana leaf with sambar, rasam, rice, curries, papadam etc with refilling too :
4
If you are coming from India, this is the place for good south Indian food. We ordered dosa, uttapa, biryani all was good. This is just opposite to gokul restaurant which is good for north indian dishes. We had lunch at Gokul and dinner at Madras new woodland. It was walk able distance for us from Concord hotel where we stay. Overall experience regarding this restaurant was good. Dr Jai
4
We always try to bring visitors here to try and see another part of Singapore. It's a place they otherwise might not enter, but we have been here several times already and the food is good and you shouldn't get any Delhi Belly here. We usually start with the dosa's which are as good as funny looking. Then you add some biryanim, vip thali, samosa's and papadum and some other bread. Finish off with a mango lassi. Cheap on top of that. Highly recommendable
4
I have been here couple of times. I found the vada very good and crispy. The quantity served could be better as I felt the dosas and vada being a touch smaller. But they were tasty and well made. The place can get busy on weekends. The service was good. Coffee taste can be improved to match the Chennai Woodlands taste. But good vegetarian food away from home
5
This South Indian restaurant is in Little India just off Serangoon Road. They serve typical vegetarian fare such as masala dosa, rava dosa and thali as well as many other dishes. The mango lassi is excellent as are the other dishes. It is very clean and the waiters will help those unfamiliar with the cuisine. An excellent choice for an unforgettable meal
4
This is one of the best place in Singapore for South Indian breakfast/meals. The set-up is modest but it has its own regular clientele with many non-Indians as regular visitors.Items worth trying are doasa, uttapam, idlis, appam and of course set south Indian meal. Top it off with a cup (sorry, glass) of tea or coffee served in traditional South Indian style and you have a satisfied stomach.Reasonable prices too to make repeat visits a must
4
Had lunch here on 22nd Dec. food was quite authentic be it their Thali or tiffen items. Still they have not localised and maintained the original taste, which should be to their credit. Definitely worth a visit.
4
Excellent South Indian food restaurant with very reasonable prices. Popular with local people.
My breakfast pit stop in the area.
4
Love the veg briyani. Wife loves the tali meal. Food is good so is the ambiance. Price is a bit high when compared to other restaurants but it's worth going.
5
They served a lot lunch, Basically I asked for dosa but they ony suggest why not to have luch it will be your brunch
5
Authentic tasty Veg Indian restaurant with friendly staff. I had the thali plate which included ten small dishes of different food and tastes along with two types of Indian bread. Very tasty. It was so good I am going back for more.
4
I visited this place because komla was over crowded.. This place is neat and clean.. I mean better than komala . Food taste and ambiance is average.. I will suggest to visit this place
4
Love to go here regularly with family including mother. The food is typical South Indian meals. Prefer the Madras Biryani option that gets you saffron rice with all the traditional south India meal plate like rasam, sambar, curries and papadam.Tried the dosa's too and they are really nice. Easily one of the best south Indian eateries in Singapore. The service is quick and food qaulity is excellen
4
Came back here for another visit, this time with the family. First sampling of paper masala dosa for the kids, and it seems they liked it. Between us we had 2 mango lassis and a lime juice, 2 paper masala dosas, 2 prata sets (consisting of 2 pratas each) and 2 wadas, for a total cost of $31. Service was friendly and helpful. A little disconcerting when paying at the end and being pressured to add a tip (previously I've not experienced that approach here, but I notice that the person handling the money has changed, so maybe with the change has come the difference in style)
4
Equally nice veg food in this area. The seating is posh and waiters will serve. The ambience is also good. They serve from breakfast to dinner. Parking is not that easy but ample parking around. Tosai or North r South Indian Thalis can never go wrong. This is slightly upmart Veg foos restaurant
5
So happy to have visited here. Went after reading good reviews and knowing it was vegetarian (as am I). Went in and the waiter asked if I'd like such and such or such and such and I just said "surprise me" as he seemed really nice and quite fun. Just after he left I suddenly worried I wouldn't have enough money so I rushed to the lady at the entrance and asked if they took cards. She said no, but not to worry if I didn't have enough I could leave and pay tomorrow. Cannot believe how trusting she was considering I was a tourist who could easily have never come back. The waiter brought a selection of curries, rice and bread which looked and tasted amazing. Luckily I did have enough money - not surprising as the food, desert and drink only came to SG $12 in total
3
Food here is a little on the Expensive Side, We ordered 2 Masala Dosa's, they were just ok, they were small in size and it din't have that taste.
4
I come here for my monthly fix of South Indian food. The Sambar Vada, dhosas, thali are the best. This place is also popular with locals and tourists. Must try if you are in the vicinity of little India.
5
Great service from friendly staff. Delicious food, amazing dosa's, fluffy poori's, difficult to find a comparison in Australia. Also, get the lime juice.
1
Stood waiting for a table, got waved into another room. Went there to find one table empty, very dirty from previous customers. Stood waiting and was ignored by the staff for a few minutes. Asked someone, got called back into the other room to another dirty table with only two seats (for three people).Staff seemed disgusted that we'd ask for another chair and the table to be wiped.Went a door or two down to Lagnaa and had a much better experience
4
Been going there for over a decade and always enjoyed the food especially the dosa and vadei. But had no idea how authentic it was until I brought my friend from Dehli and he assured me that the food was just as good if not better. For the record he enjoyed the creamy rice
5
I happened upon this by chance. What a a great find. I had the most delicious tea , strong flavoursome masala tea with heavenly spices - so refreshing. I also had the garlic naan set. The naans are freshly made and piping hot, like the tea. They only serve vegetarian fare. It was full of locals. The waiter was very helpful too and introduced me to appams for desert
4
Came back here for breakfast this morning. 2 paper masala dosas, 2 coffees and 2 wadas for about $15. All very tasty and with quite efficient service. Quality here is comparable to what you get in India, although perhaps not quite as much taste. Remarkably popular at 8.30am on a Friday morning. I'll be back again
5
Knowing that I love Indian food and I always love trying new foods, my friend took me here for breakfast - Indian style. It was BIG breakfast for both of us - upuma, vadai, masala dosa. The sambar is absolutely the best sambar I've had in any restaurant, the vadai is crisp on the outside and yet so lightweight in the inside. The paper dosa is at least 2 feet long and so crispy - the masala is just so yummy (although I couldn't finish this last meal because it was too much).The restaurant was almost packed at 8 AM. We saw many locals had breakfast there - Chinese and Malay included. Service was fast, waiter spoke good English and very polite yet friendly

This place was a decent indian restaurant.South Indian is good, however the north indian was average. The service was little on poor side, need to keep waiting for the waiters as they are short staffed. but they are very courteous. Would recommend south indian tiffins onl

We stumbled across this restaurant all hot, bothered and hungry, not a great combo when looking for a quality place to eat! We were pleasantly treated to air conditioning, a varied vegetarian menu and fast service and food delivery. Our kids had Masala Dosa and we chose to leap into a classic southern Indian dish with a sample of about eight small bowls. Think it was called Thai VIP? We were the only caucasians in the place and the only ones fumbling around using our hands to eat. It was packed and we were lucky to get a table. We thoroughly enjoyed it and were treated with kindness and respect, which more than we can say for a few of the other stores we visited while in Little India.Big thumbs up for this one

Had dinner at this place. It is famous for south Indian food. Service is very fast. Staff is very polite. It has started serving North Indian especially Punjabi food also. It has separate sitting section for family. Recommend for taste of yummy food.
5
If you are looking for an authentic Indian resturant, you are at the right place. Try their aapam and coconut milk, one of the best in Singapore. Good place to have a quick hot tasty meal. Service is excellent and fast. Overall I'll give +++++

Yummy - that's all we want to say.
Really great home-cooked Indian vegetarian food - good menu.
Yummy.
5
The food was delicious.... Just like home cooked food.... The food unlimited..... The price is affordable.... Really appreciate the staff as they were friendly and helpful.. I will definitely recommend it to my friends n family...Had a great dinner....
5
Singapore has no dearth of South Indian food but I must say, according to me STILL the only restaurant which gives you authentic south indian taste is this place.All others have either localised the dishes or done fusion whereas the homely taste is maintained. Ambience is nothing much worth to be mentioned but tasty food and good service definitely makes up for all other things. Really a very good choice for authentic South Indian dishes
5
I've eaten here as a kid and I remember it being a very old Indian restaurant with a dated 80s decor but it had the best lassi and thosai. I decided to come back after yonks for nostalgia sake and it looks exactly the same! The thosai was fantastic and it's been awhile since I had great thosai. My partner ordered a naan which he says was average but did agree that the thosai was stellar. It's a lot less crowded than it used to be but I like it more now, because it's less hectic. A great vegetarian place as well which I'll bring my vegetarian colleagues to the next time I swing by Little India
5
I was really hungry.... only looking for vegetarian food... Coincidencly I found this restaurant luckily... Food is awesome and delicious.. The food was unlimited...I found this food made me realise as I was having home food.. Service staff was friendly and pleasant. ..Had a great lunch... semmmeeee saapadu...!! Must try..!
4
The food served was hot and taste simple and authentic.It is difficult to mention these two in reviews at some of basic restaurants today but this small humble place not only belittles them but creates a mark of their own with their good simple south indian food.Yes most udipis across south of India serve this but not everywhere in Singapore you will find this simplicity
4
Been eating here since my first trip back in 1988, this place has been very consistent with food quality over the years, the food is inexpensive, clean, fresh and hygienic, they always get an, "A, from the health department for hygienic conditions. The place gets packed during lunch time and dinner, so you may want to call for a reservation, but its not necessary. Two people can easily eat here for less then $20. This is a pure Vegetarian place and no liqueur is served.
4
I've been coming here many times over the past 8 years or so and visited again today for lunch after a gap of some 2 years. The dosas continue to be amongst the best I've had in Singapore: I almost always go for the paper masala dosa and haven't yet been disappointed. Prices have certainly crept up over the years but are still reasonable. Well worth a visit
5
What a nice restaurant. We were on a tour of little India and this stop was just delightful. We had coffee and sides and the dessert was just wonderful. Great vegetarian mean!
4
Delicious dosas, parathas, puris, vadai etc - I think this is the best of its kind in Little India. Lassi and indian coffee and chai also good. Pure veg of course. So if you're body's hanging out for some south Indian food, come on down.
5
Reasonably priced compared to Singapore standards. If Indian do not compare prices with Indian counterparts as you will find that the portions of serving are smaller. Parathas were satisfying.
4
Had an authentic vegetarian thali with a friend truly enjoyed the lunch.Would definately go back again and try their variety of dosas that they have.Reasonably priced.
5
Not for pretty ambiences, fancy services, meant for affordbale, sim[ple yet yummy vegeterian south indian good...a favorite amng regulards who are budget conscious and want a filling tasty quick meal! again been visting for yrsss and will continue to do so :)
5
My previous review said that this is a great place to eat . On this visit I found the quality is even better. I am sure that this is because of the personal involvement of the owner and his family.
4
I was introduced to this restaurant by another Indian friend and never expected the taste of South Indian cuisine to be authentic. I was completely floored by the taste of their vegeterian fare. I would recommend all those who love their idli dosai's to get there soon. Very reasonable pricing too
2
I have been a regular visitor to this restaurant ( almost every Saturday) since returning to Singapore in 2012 January. Mainly because my (Indian) friends like their dosai and appam. It is good....but other things matter in a restaurant and they can at a point in time supercede the food value. This is the reason,.At 8.30 the add-on section is closed for so called " private party" and when the main area is filling up, and because of group numbers they always reluctantly " allow us " to sit in the extended area where the aircon isnt turned on until a certain group of customers arrive. Our latest experience and this was to be our last visit is because they refused to open the area until this group arrived and "wholla" lights came on, so did aircon and the manager himself served them. Now I recognise that there are some ex luminaries in this crowd but to have different standards for different customers is not acceptable. More importantly the service REALLY SUCKS.....everytime we have to "summon" staff of which there are many, just to get orders taken and last Saturday ( the 6th Sept) was the limit....we sat in the main area and for 10 minutes staff just walked by and didnt even offer a drink....NO MORE MADRAS WOODLANDS ....that was the last straw!!!!!!

Whilst Searching in Little India we came upon this restaurant with a trip advisor recommendation in the window, so thought we would give it a try. We had no idea what to order, the staff were extremely friendly and gave us personalized service ensuring we knew how to eat the meal, he had suggested. We were pleasantly surprised with how delicious the meal was and the accompanying great prices. Would certainly recommend
4
Went here for a late breakfast. I had no idea what to order so asked the waiter for his recommendation. He suggested a dosa (rice pancake) filled with potato and a mango lassi. The dosa was crisp and had a lovely filling that was gently spiced. There were dips also for the pancake that were really good. The mango lassi was amazing. Sweet and slightly sour from the yoghurt. Would love to go back again. The
5
Their dosas are fantastic. So are their parathas. Excellent food with consistent taste, am a regular customer. No complaints at all. Very good service. Fantastic food
4
We returned as we had enjoyed eating here on our last visit to Singapore. The South Indian food is tasty and very reasonably priced, and the service is friendly and efficient. We especially enjoyed the delicious breads which came straight out of the oven.
4
Very good quality vegetarian and south indian food. Dosa and other item preparations are very tasty.
4
I have been here since the 90's n after awhile trying out other restaurants, I still come back to this place... now my family are regular to this restaurant... they still maintain their food quality and taste...
4
We were in Singapore last weekend, and found the food at this place very good. We had breakfast and lunch, and our experience was excellent, with friendly staffs.
4
We visited this place as it was on the Little India guide map from the tourist bureau and it was in the guide for a reason! The proprietor greeted us at the door and immediately welcomed us in and offered a mango lassi - the best we tasted throughout the trip. He then proceeded to describe some of the dishes to gauge what we liked and a few minutes later delicious paratha and dosa filled our table and our bellies.Well priced at less than $20 for the lot, air conditioned, good service and a lovely atmosphere, this is definitely worth a try
4
We were touring Singapore and were pretty tired of seeing the same seafood & ice creams - being vegetarian limits your option even more. After a very tiring day this restaurant was the much needed relief we were looking for .. it's located in a side road in Little India. We had the Madras thali & VIP thali (north+ south Indian dishes) and it was very good! The spice levels were just right, taste balanced and the plate had many a variety. Top that with the restaurant willing to serve us extra rice, sambar etc., really made our day. The staff was also very courteous .. oh and I almost forgot, the food was served on banana/plantain leaves! Definitely recommend the Madras thali .
4
The mainly vegetarian South Indian and a handful North IndianDishes are reasonably tasty.The waiters are ALL quite friendly though 1or 2 are a little slow off their feet.The 'THALI' dishes are a FULL MEAL(you may have North or South Indian ) and consist of a leaven poori,prata.mini-chappatti.The rice,vegetables and pappadums are unlimited......be aware of the desserts...they tend yo be excessively sweet in natureThe prices are extremely reasonable
4
The place is small but the service is impeccable. Very impressive with every one serving. Good variety of food is well. Particularly like the special dosa's that they have daily. Green Peas masala dosa stands out for me.This place is hidden in a quiet corner off the buffalo road - I did not know of this place until my friend took me there and from then on i have been a regular to this place. Great Price value for the food served. Easiest way to reach this place is take the purple line get down at the Little India station and take the Buffalo road exit

Located off the main street of Serangoon Road in Little India, MNW (Madras New Woodlands) is the place to be. After the sweltering heat (no thanks to the humid Singapore climate) from sight seeing in the robust and colourful streets of Little India, one would find comfort in the air-conditioned heaven in MNW.Entering MNW, you will be loudly greeted by super friendly waiters while you seat yourself at the table. The signboard menu on the wall with all unfamiliar names of unfamiliar dishes may be unnerving to the unfamiliar but say the word, and the helpful waiter will swoop over to your side and guide you cheerfully and patiently through the menu, explaining what each dish contains and whether he thinks you're game enough to explore the spice factor in some dishes. Even if you're unsure after a menu walk-through, the waiter will be happy to suggest what he thinks you will enjoy, all with the pearliest smiles you can ever find in Singapore (and with some friendly jokes on the sides).Best food to try is VIP Thali platter. It satiates the large appetite of hungry backpackers, while at the same time, appeals to the curiosity of petite locals without overwhelming their tummies. Lassi (mango, sweet or salty versions) is the best drink to accompany with. One can choose to use forks and spoons, or to embrace the Indian way of using hands (wash basin with soap and paper towels is available at the side of the restaurant). As always, there is always room for dessert and one can indulge in freshly-made apams prepared behind your table (you can even watch the process).The best deal of the whole experience - It is super duper cheap. Two super hungry backpackers can wallop two sets of VIP Thali platters with second helpings of roti and bhatura (ballooned version of roti), mango lassi and apam to finish the meal off for only SGD30. Now that's the real charm
5
An authentic indian restaurant, crowded at lunch. Difficult to pick your food as there is no description, just look around what other people are eating and ask the same. Pretty spicy and big portions. Take a menu and share!
4
A very good restaurant in Little India serving very tasty vegetarian food. We had a thali and it could not be faulted. The restaurant does not serve alcohol.
5
I had breakfast here.The food was hot ,straight from the oven not spicy.The warm greeting at the door and the help rendered in getting you a seat in a very crowded place is very personalised.
4
For thosai lovers, this is the best thosai place in Little India. My favourite is Rava Thosai. The people there recognise you after some time although they don't know your name. It's just gone through a new face-lift & looks elegant. Prices are kept low to cater to the masses
5
H folks. Have travelled extensive through out the world ... Would rate this restaurant as one of the best South Indian restaurants any where including my own Chennai....Cooks are trained from new woodlands hotel chennai and all items are too tasty ..Good old service through bearers but still no service tax I reckon ....Try the curry puff n masala dosa ....

Being Syrian Orthodox, my family is technically supposed to be vegetarian for the whole of Lent. Usually we don't manage to pull that off but by way of compensation we all meet up for a vegetarian dinner every Good Friday. We've been doing this for ten years at least and the place we usually go to is Madras New Woodlands.The ambience is what you'd expect- not top notch, but serviceable and clean. Staff are sometimes a bit inefficient given the huge number of orders my large and hungry extended family places but they get there in the end.This year I had the chole battura and a rava onion dosa. The battura (there's no easy wa to explain a battura in English- it's a puffed up fried Indian flatbread) was perfectly made- you could taste the richness of the dough and while the chole (chickpea curry) was a little watery it still tasted great. No complaints about the rava (semolina) onion dosa (a dosa is best described as a rice flour crepe though to put it that way sounds insufferably pretentious)- it was crispy and hot with a generous distribution of onions, pepper and chilli studding the dough.My wife had the cheese dosa and while that's not personally my sort of thing, she pronounced herself extremely satisfied. It came with a very nicely done mint dressing which tasted freshly made. She also had a samosa chaat which I shared with her- this is a basically a potato samosa chopped up and tossed with a dressing of tomatoes, onions, chickpeas- which was nicely savoury.As a group of twelve I think we ended up eating about fifteen rava dosas (either rava onion or the masala variety), a couple of baturas, four samosa chaats and a few cheese dosas so you can see that the masses did come to some sort of consensus on the highlights of the menu.Like I said, we've come here on Good Friday (and at random other occasions) for most of a decade and given the quality of the food, we see no reason to alter this tradition

Actually, the food and the owner are great. Many a time the owner and his wife talk to customers and customers have become friends. This has always been the case. I am surprised to find this review as I was present when this happened. When a customer starts interfering with their staff who are trying to solve the situation at hand and who had called his regular private doctor to come to attend to him immediately one should not interfere. They are being a nuisance and a hindrance to the owner who is upset and urgently trying to solve the problem. In my opinion, if it was me, I would have asked the customers to leave immediately! Yet they allowed them to sit down and iswarya and her partner.I was present at the time and iswarya had many unnecessary pompous remarks and was hindering the situation.An ambulance can be called but why a private hospital ambulance?Have you been bothered to find out about what happened to the cashier?I have been going to this restaurant as a child and the old man has always spoken highly of how the owner manages his staff and has taken care of his well being. Again this is what the old man said to the very annoying customer from what I saw.Many customers were honestly annoyed with iswarya and no one else interfered as they could clearly see the good the owner was doing and how is was handling the situation. Honestly, in how many places do you see an owner rush to the scene and immediately engage a private doctor to attend to him? I even heard the owner talk to a specialist who was telling him what to do. I would definitely return to this restaurant not only for their excellent food and for the fact that the owner takes care of his staff well! Also for the fact that he gives an opportunity for the elderly to be employed. This is the Singapore way

We used to eat in this joint quite frequently. They do have decent South Indian food. Yesterday, we were having our dinner there when the 76-year-old cashier fainted. Some responsible person in the public called an ambulance and meanwhile, the employees called their employer to report the incident. The paramedics still came, checked his vitals and they were very poor for a person of his age (he had low Blood pressure) and they insisted on him being taken to the hospital immediately. They chatted with the employer. The employer asked the ambulance to go away quoting that he is on his way to help, even made the patient's son sign the ambulance off. As concerned public, we waited in vain for the owner to arrive for about 1 hour and only the two if us waited until that pompous and rude owner arrived (even until that point the old man had very bad vitals) and the first thing he did as soon as he stepped into the hotel was to ask us to get out and he will handle his servants, he did not even care to go see the man first. He started ranting about this being his property and we were trespassing by not moving out of the room (we didn't even say we wouldn't go, we just said we wanted to stay and help). He was very rude to us, couldn't give a damn for customers who actually wanted to help his employees. Or even treat us with some respect. He blew his top off and none of the waiters could do anything about him. We have decided never to go back to this restaurant or eat in a place where a man has nor respect for human rights, his employees, or his customers. He made a scene before all other customers who were still eating, yelling at us as if we were wrong. WE ARE NEVER GOING BACK. And would advice others as well to eat elsewhere

We ate here not really knowing what to expect. The service was perfunctory but the food was quickly prepared and very tasty. We knew little about many of the dishes so, took pot luck! I really enjoyed my cheese dosai. Pleased we visited this back street of Little India.
1
we chose this restaurant because it is in the vicinty of our hotel and the good recommondations here. unfortunately, we did not see that it is a vegatarian one, but tried it anyway. location and athmosphere was not that fancy, waiter seemed to be a bit bored (but maybe normal in non touristic areas as we knew already from thailand!?). lots of real indians inside - great to get in contact with indian culture itself. the menu was short, not comprehensive for people who just have got familiar with the fundamental chicken tikka, tandori chicken and naan bread. the waiter recommended the vip plate - selection of various dishes. this was nice to get a great first overview. water was of no charge, mango lassi was refreshing. eventually, it didnt meet our expectations
4
ambience is not great. very good food and cheap as chips, excellent service, food is teher before you know and have maintained their standard from last 7 years we have been going regularly and we always eat atleast twi\ce there. specially appam is excellent
4
This is such a favourite Indian. The food is tasty, great value and the atmosphere is relatively serene!
As others have said, Appams are a must, though they are not always available.
Ans the masala tea is easily the best around!
4
If u want authentic Indian vegetarian food at a reasonable price, this is the place to go to. The cooks are from India. My mum being a pure vegetarian was having her meals here practically everyday.
4
I have always eaten at vegetarian restaurants in Little India but a few years ago, I found Madras New Woodlands. It was a fantastic find - now I am always dropping by for my favourite Rava Thosai. I think it is the best in Little India, although a little more expensive
5
I ended up going back to this restaurant quite a few times despite a very short visit to Singapore this time. The food is vegeterian, and uniformly delicious --it really doesn't matter what you order, everything just burst on your tongue with flavours. The service is pretty prompt too as they are always busy (that's the only drawback --their is a sense of hurry as folks are usually waiting for your table to empty). Can't recommend this enough
5
One of the most wonderful breakfasts I have ever had. The dosas were out of this world, and towards the end of the meal the waiter recognized that we were adventurous eaters and just started bringing us things he thought we might like. Each dish was better than the next.
4
we stumbled across this place literally starving and were most impressed with the kind & often humorous waiters offering their knowledge on both north & south cuisine. u can't go wrong coz it's all vegetarian. have a giggle with the staff, they r a lot of fu
3
A quiet and simple restaurant but the food is good and service is OK. I had the VIP Thali, like other have suggested in other posts and that was what was recommended by the waiter too. A selection of small vegetarian dishes with thick pancake like bread and a selection of chutney. Good food all in all but for me a little spicy so the Mango Lassi helped take the edge off. Good to experience some good innocent Indian cuisine at a reasonable price.
4
Madras New Woodlands has really good south indian food. the must tries are the thalis and the bathuras , the dosas are tasty as well but what really makes my day is the appam with red sugar and coconut milk. This place has the best appams. Don't leave without trying them
5
Madras New Woodlands is an old Singapore south Indian place with high quality food. The battura set is one of my favourites and the vip thali is my husband's. The ingredients are fresh and the restaurant feels clean and hygienic. I can also recommend the lassis and puris (puffed fried bread). One of the pluses is that the air conditioning is strong, a welcome break from Singapore's humidity
