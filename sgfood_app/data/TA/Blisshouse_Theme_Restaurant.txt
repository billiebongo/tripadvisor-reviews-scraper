Went there for lunch on d 4th of March. Was there only customer there as the restaurant just started operation hours. Staff is very welcoming and efficient. Food is also fantastic. Me and my wife enjoyed our lunch time there. Will be going over again.

Nice interior and it was good for taking pictures. Staff were friendly as well. They were also open to hearing customers' opinions about the food.
4
The place is nicely decorated. Nice ambience with lighting and props to take photos.
Staffs served with smile and patience.
Ordered Duck Confit but the meat was a bit dry and tough. Truffles Fries was nice.
Food can be improved.

Pretty nice setting and the staff was friendly and responsive,
The pan grilled salmon and seafood pizza was very filling.

Located at the corner of a shopping mall, the place is decorated like an aspiration of every girl's dream to live like a princess and married happily everafter.The romantic arch of roses at the entrance is followed by Cinderalla-like carriage and magical swing in an outdoor garden. There are both outdoor dinining area with skyline view and indoor dining area next to digital firewood, grandfather clocks and shelves of awesome displays.On top of that, there is a majestic 5-seater sofa set and a piano to complete the whole concept of blissful ambience

The concept at Blisshouse is amazing, with all the lights and floral-love theme, it definitely is a place for couples. However, the food falls short. The broth of the spicy blue mussel (appetiser) is the only thing that is commendable, other than that everything else is pretty normal. However, the soup isn't limited to mussels only; there are other seafood in it as well. Drinks may look aplenty, but feels limited upon closer consideration. Yogurt drinks need to be improved, they taste really bad. Still, it's worth a visit for the ambience. :

This place is definitely the one where you satisfy your diva mode. You will be greeted with a beautiful small "magical" bridge with many pretty deco like in the fairytale woods. This restaurant is well catered for small weddings as well. There are not many halal cafes that are themed like this so this is a good one for the diva gathering with muslim mates. A little expensive though but im sure its okay for the divas. The food is quite nice, portion is diva-friendly. Not for the boisterous big eater. Desserts are nice. The milkshake is no no though. Quite satisfied anyway

Had many dinners here for farewells. And the food is very good. I like the Chilli Crab Pasta the most. The wagyu Beef is surprisingly good too. The place is very enchanting. The staff are friendly and you can take pictures anywhere here. A lot of instagram worthy places in the restaurant itself. Oh ya...its Halal too! Awesome.Tips: If you go in large group, order 1 or 2 items of everything and share. It will be much cheaper! We spent about $400 plus for 12 friends...and that comes up to about $33 person

Tried the restaurant out of curiosity, with low expectations of the food at first. Was surprised the revamped menu was actually quite good, with the Lamb Rendang and Sambal Halibut(discontinued now I understand) as standouts.Was intrigued by the first visit, and went back the second time, with high expectations, and was glad the standards were maintained with the Lamb, Duck Confit, but the laksa pasta was overcooked(understand that it was deliberate to suit local tastes) while the gravy taste remain robust, which saved the dish. This time we tried the Creme Brulee, and it turned out well done too. Heard from the staff, the head chef was trained in mainly western cuisine, which explained the numerous well-executed dishes, bar the pasta.The food was so good, that we discarded our initial plans for a Chinese wedding dinner and booked the restaurant for our wedding reception instead! Tom, the event planner was thorough, friendly, helpful, and above all, very understanding and patient throughout the process, which added to the joy of the high quality food.The wedding food were served buffet style, but the quality hardly wavered, and we were impressed with another dish, Seafood Baked Rice. Huge, juicy prawns, baked into numerous morsels of fish and mussels, with their in-house gravy, was a star in the lineup. Along with the on-menu prawn stick dipper, they both disappear almost as fast as they were dished out.It is no fine dining style-wise, and prices can be a little steeper here(for regular menu), but one can be almost assured of good quality food served. We even came back again after the wedding to dine again!Not too sure about the drinks as we didn't order them.Regular meal service is consistently prompt and relatively friendly here, although due to the large compound, can be a little hard to get service staff attention is place is full. Air-conditioning is cold here, so do bring extra layer, and consume the food fast

Had a dinner reservation at Blisshouse, The food are delicious and the portion are surely enough for a person. The staff are very friendly and has good customer service. The most atmosphere and decor are really suitable for couples to go be it a first date or anniversary.

Very spacious restaurant. Quiet place. Had a great time with my friends. A good place for catching up! Will visit again.
4
Great atmosphere. Excellent service though the standard of the food seems to have dropped. But overall a very good experience and will return

Good meal. The 1 for 1 pasta means I can order more. Very interesting escargot.
The waffle was awesome. Done just right. Not over crispy and has a very savory aroma.
3
The food was not very tasty. Average taste. The chicken chop was pretty blend. The truffle fries doesn't have much truffle taste. The alio olio pasta was just average kind of food.
5
The restaurant was very quiet even on a Saturday but that gave us the opportunity to roam around and take many pictures as this place has many instagram worthy spots. The food was delicious.

Had dinner at Blisshouse Theme Restaurant on Mother's Day. Upon stepping into the restaurant, it feels like I've entered wonderland! Really great ambience and atmosphere. Service was really good too and food was delivered promptly. One thing that could be improved would be the food quality as the seafood pizza and seafood paella tasted average. However I really enjoyed the chilli crab pasta

It's been a great experience to have dinner at blisshouse.. This is our 1st time and definitely we will be back to eat and listen to the acoustic music. Good value for food and quantity.. I strongly suggest if you want to have a cosy night to hangout goto blisshouse you will never regret the place... The server is too friendly and accomodating.. They will assist you from start to end of your stay.. :

We stumbled across this gorgeous, quirky, magical restaurant by accident and were so glad we did. Not only was the food top quality but the experience was like nothing we had experienced before in Australia. And while we are away on holidays we certainly want to experience NEW things. My 3 daughters thought we had fallen through the rabbit hole to the mad hatters garden. You can choose to sit in the Alice in Wonderland (type) garden or the White Rabbits House. Such fun was had by all!! If you are looking for something fun and different to do while in Singapore...Oh and for great food, please take your family to this restaurant for an awesome experience!!!

I had made a booking for 8 paxs a few weeks ago however the management had a wedding reception on the same day but i was only informed like 1.5hr ago before the booking time that partial of the area would be condoned off due to the event.Although my booking was not cancelled,my friends and i were surprised to see that our table was arranged at the window area which was hot and there was sunlight penetrating in our direction.There was basically no aircon but we had no choice as we saw only 3 reserved table arrangements were available for other guests or public.If we had been informed much earlier like a few days beforehand or a week ago,we could have other options to dine elsewhere.no events would be accepted by any dining management in such a short period so there is no reason to explain to the customers that the management had insufficient time to inform the guests who had made reservation.one of the main entrees which my friend ordered:chicken chop was served partially uncooked and bloody.However a new plate was served to her after rejecting it.the staff were quite attentive as they offered their assistance as they saw us posing pics of the display props.Overall,we will still re-consider Blisshouse to be an option for future dining

Booked a VIP room at Blisshouse for my daughter's 21st birthday . We had a wonderful time there. The service was very good there were at least 2-3 staff standing by to serve us.The food was good too. At first I thought that the food would not be enough as with all fine dinning. To my surprise the food was a lot and we ate to our heart content.The restaurant has a beautiful setting for you to take beautiful photos. We had a wonderful time  taking pictures. I strongly recommend Blisshouse if you want to have a different and memorial experience with dinning . The restaurant has a beautiful setting for you to take beautiful photos

The food is worst then plazza hat but price same as hotel. Service is good.hope they can be improve. Never order bake mushrooms. ..it is â‚©.

The environment is nice and relaxing but the food itself is not a wow factor. Also the menu has limited food list. So it is kinda disappointing. Besides food, the service is also not good. I had to wave hand till got server's attention. At that time, it was not busy and the servers were nowhere to be found

My granddaughter and I went here for lunch before leaving for our flight home. The set 3 course menu including tea, coffee or soft drink was only S$12++ We also had a glass of wine 2 for 1There is of course an a-la-carte menu too. The theme is like a beautiful magical garden,with flowers, lanterns, butterflies a garden carriage and swing. There is a massive seperate manor house style dining room suitable for parties or weddings.It's not somewhere you would notice, as is one floor up in the Central shopping Centre, Clarke Quay. Highly Recommended

Went to this restaurant to celebrate our anniversary. they have lovely decorations all around the restaurant. the ambiance was romantic as well. the service was excellent but the food was way too average for the price we paid.there are quite a number of photo spots in the restaurant and the manager volunteered to help us to take photo. thumbs up for him

I must say having my baby one year old party at Blisshouse was nothing but pure bliss (pardon the pun).The lush garden and romantic feel added a touch of class to my event yesterday. The ambience was awesome.Food was excellent as most of my guests can attest to. We had roast chicken, baked fish, pasta, calamari, salad, grilled vegetables and to top it up, the nicest chocolate cake I had in a long while.Service was good and management was very nice to allow us to borrow some of the props in the restaurant as part of our party theme.For those who want to try their food, they have an economical set lunch for weekdays at only SGD 9.90++ . i have tried their ala carte menu before and food was served fast and prompt.In my humble opinion, the ambience, food and service is worth paying extra for even though it is slightly pricey compared to other restaurants

It is a beautiful restaurant for you to take nice pictures but do not do anything else other than that. The service staff is in attentive. They don't respond you. They do not refill your water even if they walk by and should have seen that it is empty. You have to wait a long time for food that is just a little better than being edible. We had the appetizers and pastas. Now, we know why it constantly has discounted lunch set menu at cheaper and cheaper prices. There are better restaurants to visit in Central. The basement eateries offers a better variety, better services and a more reasonable price

A beautiful place for first date, gathering, birthday, ROM, wedding and events. The charming garden feel will definitely brings smiles to all diners.I am sure there is something to suit everyone palate in their comprehensive menu, but thought the pricing is a tad high for the quality serve.Passion Fruit Oreo (S$12) is my favourite drink. Perfume with sweet passion and a tad of chocolate to linger on the palate. Mischievously awesome! The drinks are not too sweet, rich and well balance.Nachos @ $10.00Smoked Chicken, Salsa, Aioli, Jalapeno Chilli, Mozzarella and Cheddar Cheese on Crispy Corn Chips baked to perfection. Surprisingly the sourness and spiciness from the green chilli married the salty cheddar cheese well.Pan-Seared Marinated Scallops And Prawns @ $22.00Fresh juicy scallops and prawns marinated with Lime, Garlic, Dill and Olive Oil. Pan-seared to perfection served with light Carrot and Cucumber slaw. Delicious!Orange Duck Confit @ $28.00Duck Leg bone is sous vide with Orange and Thyme served with Roasted Potatoes and Ratatouille with Orange Sauce was succulent and good. Very appetizing.Tomato Pesto Oven Baked Black Cod Fish @ $38.00Oven Baked Cod Fish coated with Sundried Tomato Pesto on White Mornay Sauce, served with Roasted New Potatoes, Baby Asparagus topped with light Carrot and Cucumber slaw. The cod fish was extremely moist, juicy and tender. A light and simple dish that will makes you crave for more.Full review of the place can be found at http://www.celestialdelish.com/2014/02/blisshouse-singapore.html

Long waiting time for food even though there weren't many tables. Appetizer and coffee were not warm enough, carbonara pasta at 22++ was so wet with so little bacons that were soft. Way overpriced for ala carte. Waitresses were inadequately trained and lack of knowledge even for simple things. Nothing can make up for a dining experience in a nice decor restaurant with a rude and snobbish manager. Such a pity for a nice looking restaurant. I would not return again

Service of the staff was horibbly bad. Have never seen a F & B establishment with such poor customer service inclusive of the asst manager on duty. Soup was alrite, Main course was poor. Bland and sandy. Now I understand why such a beautiful looking restaurant has such poor crowd even during prak hours when the restaurant offers cheap set meals. Thanks to the manager n his staff. Once is enuff if you do not want to walk out feeling pissed

It's my friend's birthday and she chose this place for the celebration cos it looks similar concept as Fullhouse theme restaurant at Rendezvous hotel which we liked very much. We were quite disappointed with this place...other than similar looking decor, this place is nothing like Fullhouse. Food is expensive, service is slow and lousy. Waiting time for food is painfully long despite the place is 90% empty at lunch hour!Upon seated, we were presented a horrible looking menu...shabby looking printed white paper that is stapled together...it is torn, dirty, stained and crumbled.We requested for ice water and it took them a whole 30mins to serve. Food takes over an hour to arrive. They even served alcoholic drink to my friend who ordered non-alcoholic and only told her about it after she drank it!Food mostly tasted blah despite the hefty price tag. Serving portion for my dish is very small and I left the restaurant still feeling hungry and very much poorer.Overall dining experience was pretty bad..I would not return ever again
