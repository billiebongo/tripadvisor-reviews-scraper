Honest good tasting seafood. Too many options is the only problem, the butter prawns were fantastic. This is the fourth or fifth time I ate here, why go somewhere else?

Areived in Singapore and this is short walk feom my apartment. Food was good. Can have a meal from $5 to $$$$. Average for 1 person meal is $14. Worth a try

Had food here or from here 3 time in one week. All good to very good. Herbal chicken, braised pig trotters, and clay pot prawns were delicious. The atmosphere is typical, local restaurant frequented by locals at a good price. Can't ask for better.

We have been going to this place ever since my relatives lived next door until they moved. After a few years, we decided to go here for Sunday lunch, and they still do not disappoint.Except for a strand of hair in our chili crab (which they gave us a 20% discount as we found the strand on the last cut up piece, in effect basically ate the whole dish by then), the rest were spot on. We had cereal crab, the standard kiddie food of sweet sour pork, fish head curry, vegetables, seafood hotpot, beef hofan, and a few others. Not high end, but really more of an upgraded hawker center as they have outdoor tables but also an indoor room (where we stayed). They are normally full for dinner, and we were easily accomodated for lunch. Well worth the taxi fare versus all those other chili crab restaurants in Clark Quay

Forture Seafood Steam Boat Restaurant is part of a mini hawker center-style dining experience. You can get your food and eat outside in the covered area, or you can ask to have your food brought to you in the adjacent air conditioned restaurant. If you are in this part of Singapore - on Bukit Timah Road, and especially if you like seafood, I recommend giving this restaurant a try.Although this is a seafood restaurant, they also offer chicken, beef, pork, and venison. Many dishes let you select which meat is included. During the day, you can order at the outside cashier, arrange to sit in the air conditioned restaurant, and they will bring your food. I have not tried this restaurant at night and suspect that you can sit and order inside for dinner.I gave this five stars due to the excellent food and extensive menu. Keep in mind that this is casual dining, so it doesn't compare to an expensive five-star restaurant. But so much of the best food in Singapore comes with casual dining that this needs to have the highest rating.I live in Singapore while teaching college every fall for three months. I have just moved to an apartment down the street. I expect to eat at Forture several times each week, for both lunch and dinner. Maybe I will see you there

Service always friendly.Ordered some usual dishes.Didn't order the curryfish head but we had Lemongrass chix, watercress soup, homemade tofu, hokkien mee w clams and stirfried green dragon vegetable.Tried this dish new to us, strawberry prawns, it's aromatic but too sweet for our liking.Otherwise it's another wholesome meal

Food and service to a high standard. Wilson has always a good recommendation for you. We frequent this place quite a number of times over the years. Consistent good meals to very good meals. Bring your own wines, and drinks - the drink stall is really snobbish and arrogant see below.KIM SAN LENG BUKIT TIMAHUnfortunately, the coffee shop Kim San Leng lets all Its tenants down with a grumpy arrogant relative running the drinks stall. Shouts and berates his customers, slow service and poor hygiene. Quibble about how many cups you can have with a large bottle of mineral water - 2 plastic cups with ice. (Kim San Leng owner - please take note, you are successful but your uncle will ruin your business)

First visited this place in 2000 and recently went back--same, place, same value, great menu. It's great for large groups (huge tables, take reservations, seem to always have space)--and allows you to order many dishes to share. There's nothing fancy about this spot or all that unique--but it's rare a place, especially in food-centric Singapore, to consistently meet high expectations--AND--with such an extensive menu, there's something for everyone

This is my second visit as I liked the food here.We ordered fish maw soup, chili crab, fried man tou, Egg plant with minced meat, mee goreng and fish stir fried with bean paste and bitter gourd.The sauce of the chili crab was super delicious. The fried man tou was very crunchy on the outside, yet soft on the inside. The dipping of man tou into the sauce was the perfect combination and not to be missed.However, the service was rather poor. We sat in the air con section of the restaurant. After our food was served, no one was around to assist us. We had to walk to the other side of the restaurant to ask for assistance and also to pay

a small restaurant that is easy to miss - but if possible, DON'T miss out on eating there. the food is great. seating is indoor and outdoor.

Forture, yes that's right it's misspelled intentionally. Legend, now lost in the mists of time, has it that the fates of the restaurant changed when a careless sign maker misspelled Fortune. A good backstory just makes a neighborhood fixture all that more attractive doesn't it? Brass tacks. This is what is known locally as a Tze Char joint, which means that the wok-powered kitchen churns out traditionally Chinese stir-fry dishes, some that have been so commingled with other ethnic dishes as emerge as unrecognizable as the original but uniquely Singaporean.If you want a true taste of Singapore, drop by any Tze Char joint and you won't be very disappointed...certainly not Panda Express disappointed. Recommendations:Chili Crab. This is the house special made with ginormous mud crabs flown in fresh and alive from Sri Lanka, though this may change over time as locally bred aquacultured crabs will soon be available. These meaty monsters are killed, and the fresh crab given a brief but fiery passage in the wok to be served steaming in a hell broth sauce of tomato paste, chili sauce, egg and other magical things...an ingredient for an intoxicatingly addictive crab meat pickin' good time.Fish Head Curry. You'll just have to try to this lightly spicy, coconut broth based dish to believe that fish head are actually pretty darned good. This with a bowl of steamed rice is all that you will ever need to attain Nirvana.Other worth mentions:Cereal prawnsFried Man Tou (Chinese steamed buns)...this is actually de rigeur when ordering the Chili Crab.Herbal Chicken Soup.Sliced been with Scallions and GingerSeafood Hor Fun...just have fun and remember I sent you.

Was there for 1pm lunch on Saturday, their off peak timing. Ordered salted egg crab and coffee pork ribs. Both were very well done. Food was served hot and v tasty. Crab was of good size $58/kg. The sambal kailan was too hard. With three bowls of rice, our bill was $82.50 for the three of us.

The Forture delivers consistently satisfying and well cooked local dishes and is one of my family's favourite places. Their seafood is delicious - especially the black pepper crab and chili crab. We have returned many times and given it the nickname "Crabby Jacks". There is always a fight for the pumpkin prawns and their black pepper beef is excellent too - My mouth is watering just thinking about it! Sit outside in the carpark for the full authentic experience or book a table in their aircon restaurant. Service is a la hawker style so don't expect too much and its absolutely fine. Drinks are hawker prices and you can BYO wine without charge :

We always try and make a stop here whenever we're in town, and it never disappoints. From their special fried rice to their sweet and sour pork, the food is consistently good. This time we also had the fish with mango and the deer meat with oyster sauce. Excellent selections! You will not be disapopinted

When the restaurant gets busy, the taste of the food gets compromised. So please visit on weekdays or off peak hours. My favorite dish is their coffee pork ribs/chops. The steam herbal chicken is also another of my favorite. If you visit in the day, the same coffee shop has a fish soup stall and a malay food stall. Both serves tasty food. I'd skip the bak kut teh stall though, it's below standard.

This is a great place for Asian food.Butterprawns are delicious, so is the sweet and sour pork.For us the hightlight is always the Mongolian beef, sizzling hot, with a mildly spicy sauce.The sauce mixes great with their fried rice.In short : Great place to eat at a friendly pric

This is a down to earth place. Please don't expect a fancy restaurant with nice elegant interior and great service. This restaurant is just and all about delicious chilli crab! And it is just great! The prices are really fair compared to downtown restaurants like Jumbo seafood

I have been here with family, I have been here with friends and it never disappoints. I dont spend too much time on the menu, usually when we come we are on a mission: chili and black pepper crab!! our last visit in October was some of the freshest, tastiest crab we have eaten. But the rest of the food is very good, too, some interesting dishes. No pretensions, just good cooking at a reasonable price. Sit inside if you can.I think this place kills Jumbo for chili crab, both in freshness and price. Jumbo is out of the stratosphere now price-wise, and its not that good

Forture serves no frills 'tze char' food at very reasonable prices. They are famous for their chili and pepper crab. However, we ordered the red wine pork ribs, fish head steamboat, famous toufu, clay pot noodle and stir fried spinach. We loved all of them.My favorite dish was the red wine pork ribs as the meat was succulent. When you take a bite of the meat, they would fall off the bone easily. The ribs was marinated with a special red wine sauce consisting of red wine, which was very tasty.The service was poor as the person who took our orders was impatient and rude. The servers are not around us usually, so it was very difficult if you need anything.The restaurant is divided into outdoor and indoor air con section. There are limited tables in the air con section. Forture is a popular place among the locals, so it gets very crowded after 7 pm. Do call in advance for reservation, if you want to dine in the air con section

Tables outside but a fun environment. Delicious food! We had hotplate Maggi deer meat, sweet/sore pork, dry chilli chicken & Hong Kong fried noodles.

I have been frequenting this place for over 15 years. The food is consistently great and well priced. You get the whole hawker experience. Including the indifference of the staff! But that doesn't put me off going time and time again. Great nosh!

Our family especially like the herbal chicken here. It has no bitter taste and cooked just right. Other dishes are good too.

We always love to return to this place each time we visit Singapore! It is unpretentious, and serves excellent Chinese/Hawker style food, delivered piping hot to the table! The special fried rice is very good, as as the sweet and sour pork spare ribs. Another favorite is the salt and pepper crab -- all of it simply delicious! You can't go wrong

Not only was the service bad and the staff rude, the food wasn't nice (sweet and sour fish was dry, coffee pork had too much coffee, noodles lacked ingredients but salted crab was alright). They took rather long to get the bill too. Insufficient parking space. Overall just bad, don't bother.

I ordered individual portions zi-char and I found styrofoam on one occasion, and a metal buckle (1cm by 1.5cm) in another occasion in the food! Food that I ordered is beef hor fun and the other time is san-lou hor fun. When I tell the staff (who is always around), they just take away that extra "item" before I could take photo and did not get back to me!!! I won't eat there anymore unless for group meals.Ordering dishes for sharing is so far ok or perhaps because we does not always finish so did not see any. Frankly, food is nothing fantastic. But it is seldom fully occupied so one will choose this place for meals. Note that even though there are not many tables, waiting time for food is same as any other

The food is decent and my family has been going there for a few years. They even allow a service that allows you to call ahead to place your order and you can pick it up.This evening I called to place an order at 6.40 pm. Was told that my order will be ready in 20 minutes. We arrived at 7.15 pm and was told it was not ready. .only after I insisted twice did they check on my order ... by then it was 7.40 pm. Even then the food was only ready at 8 pm and this is after I kicked up a fuss because everyone who came to place orders whilst we were waiting got their food! What really upset me was that the cashier did not even bother to apologise - nonchalantly said that she we didn't take the order! Very very disappointing

Visited 3 times during our short stay in Singapore. Prices are reasonable though higher than in food centers. No service charge. The food is really great and tasty. Ask Ivon (round-face girl about 30 years old) to recommend you smth. They have nice mongolian-style diahes as well as traditional chinese and of cource chili and pepper crab. But the last one I couldn't try cause all 3 times the crabes were over 1 kilo each and it was too expensive for me. Hope to return somewhen

So this restaurant has done what every restaurant should do! Keep it simple and serve brilliant food..The mother daughter duo is very hands on and friendly and one can see that in the quality of food and serviceWe loved the crabs and the seafood fried rice on this visit but I must admit that the food is fabulous and I have never had an opportunity to complain.It may not be high on the decor but it overcomes shortcomings on that front by the great food they manage to rustle up every tim

Very local, the kind of place that is more concerned with food than glamour. Plastic table cloths, basic decor. However the food is very, very good. Pepper crab a must try! Kai Lan with garlic is beautifully tender - I could go on!Go early as they get very busy in the evening.
