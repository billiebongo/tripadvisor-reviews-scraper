Went on a Saturday - admittedly quite late. However, was surprised to find it relatively empty and the staff apologetic that they weren't able to provide cocktails.

Been here for cocktails some time back and also had a few dishes. The beef ribs was very tasty. Very nice place to chill; relaxing and quiet for a weekday night.

Quirky place that makes you stop and wants to peek inside. The bartender is able to mix you drinks to your taste, which is a great service. It was overall a nice place to hangout and chat.

I was here with some friends and we had some very spectacular and imaginative cocktails. The staff are very friendly and the place itself is nice and relaxed.
Highly recommended!

Wednesday night and there was literally no one. Dead atmosphere. They are doing good job on social media to make this place looks happening. The food was surprisingly good, nothing short of creative or memorable (I have forgotten all that I ate after few days) but all were decently executed. When we were there, came around 20 students.. Overheard that the hostess actually recommended them to try other restaurants because it is difficult to seat 20ish pax together (!!! the restaurant was empty !!!). The same hostess answered "I like nothing from the menu" when we asked her recommendation of the food, and then sat with us while we were ordering......They might need to prioritize training their front of the hous

My colleague and I stumbled upon Phat Cat Laundry when looking for a place to lunch today, and were very pleasantly surprised. The concept for the lunch was simple--create your own bowls by choosing one grain, one meat/veggie main, and style of egg. Ingredient choices are limited, but what they have on the menu they do really well. It was delicious and good value for money. I had a garlic rice bowl with grilled cauliflower and cheese, kimchi and an egg sunny side up-- so good. My colleague was equally impressed with her grilled pork with bbq sauce. Normally an evening food and drinks place, they just started opening for lunch yesterday. We hope they continue to serve lunch because we will be back

Felt like this is one of those places where it sounds cool but concept or food quality is not quite delivered.We were very much looking forward to the dinner after reading good reviews and found the theme quite interesting.Ran out of HH wine before we sat down (being the first seating for dinner) (which for a new restaurant was absolutely fine) but none of the fusion cocktails really stood out. I eventually chose one which wasn't memorable and it all prob felt overpriced at this stage. Food wise, it was disappointing. Brontosaurus char siew ribs had no char siew taste. Crab noodles was bland, although cooked well and was al dente

I went there with a couple of friends under their recommendation .. what a pleasant surprise .. we were welcomed by a charming lady who led us to our table ..she suggested us the happy hour menu and the cocktail of the month .. Happy hour is very very attractive .. from 6to7 it's $6 net for house pour spirits, wine and beers .. ! 7to8 $7 net .. we had few drinks then a couple of cocktails ... we ordered few items to share before the mains .. i really enjoyed the egg roll and the cauliflower .. for mains the bone marrow and the fried rice was just fantastic .. we will definitely come back soon ..
