One of a number of cafes which sprouted around Everton Park some years back. Mere minutes away from the Outram Park / Police Cantonment Complex NEL exit.
Small place, good but not outstanding selection of various beverages. Cozy ambience for intelligent conversation.

Sandwiches here are simple but satisfying. Coffee is pretty good with a fair number of different types to choose from. As this place is relatively near my office , I drop by every so often to get a drink or a sweet treat ..

Small place in the Everton complex. They have all equipment for interesting brews. Nice teas. Fine place to sit down and relax, talk or study, and drink coffee or tea/eat something small. Superfood Iced Cappuccino.

Friendly staff, very realistic, simple and quaint. They roast their own beans and take coffee seriously. Good espresso. Some of the filter coffees are really good some pretty average. They have a limited menu but their food is good.

Came here after lunch in the area to try the coffee. My cappuccino was really very good with some pretty coffee art. Service was efficient and the location kind of quirky, beneath an HDB estate. Atmosphere inside was sufficiently chilled. Worth another visit.

A place to enjoy various coffee. I order a rose latte to enjoy. Quite nice smell and good taste. The Chicken Tandoori Wrap is quite nice too, maybe i can take up the spicy so i think the Chicken Tandoori Wrap should be more spicy. :) overall it is quite good can order. Not very expensive too.

Just 5 mins walking from Outram Part Mrt, this small coffee shop offers really nice and high quality coffee. Staffs and really nice and friendly, they can serve you different coffer brewing type like siphon or dripping. The beans is selected carefully blended in different tastes. Coffee is served in very beautiful and lovely cups ;) It's not so crowded so you could enjoy hand brew coffee everyday and have a nice discuss with barista about the tastes of coffee. I love to sit there to enjoy coffee while doing my work. One plus point is this place has free wifi and you can ask the staff for the password

In Singapore, coffee is a daily affair. There is the local kopi-tiam (coffee shop in local dialect) which used to brew 'nanyang style' coffee with the coffee sock. The ubiquitous SB also invaded almost every other neighborhood mall. If you have lived outside Singapore and been used to having a nice cafe in your hood , with a skilled barista serving you your daily dose, you would love this cosy coffee place. This is as close as it could get - a good cup of coffee served out of a little shop in a HDB block. Prices are alright. You can definitely get a decent cup here. The owners brought in Intelligentsia's beans and have a roaster at the back of the shop. Problem is, the place is way too cosy (read: small) and so you really ought to avoid lunch hours. I would only do coffee here if you are as fussy about cakes as I am. The cakes are alright , but yes, just alright. Afterall, you just want coffee if you make your way here.

I've enjoyed a cappuccino or two during every visit to Singapore, ever since this upmarket little cafe opened. I attempted to order a coffee recently, but found staff indifferent, perhaps even blase(?) Waited at the unattended counter for a couple of minutes, without success; then sat and deleted photos from my camera for another ten. Hoped when a waiter glanced at me briefly, from a distance, that this might mean service... but sadly it didn't. The place wasn't particularly busy, but personnel seemed disinterested... . I left without my caffeine

Perfect place for imagine living in a 3 ROOM HDB flat. The cafe is filled with the fragrance of coffee and visual of books. A perfect hide out from town. For tourist who wants a feel of being a local, come here ! The cafe is located JUST BELOW local residences HBD. Pair ur coffee with a plain croissant and butter with a good read to make ur afternoon a perfect one
