quaint joint with a plethora of cider (true to the name). friendly service. good for pairs or groups. reasonably priced.

They offer non-sparkling ciders. We ordered the SPARKLING Ciders but they were flat and warm. Terrible drink! We prefer ice cold beer somewhere else!
Food is not cheap too and quality not good. Will not visit again... :(

Always my favourite place for beer. Love their 1litre mug. Staff are nice and friendly. Cosy environment

Awesome selection of ciders and beer. The service can be abit slow during peak hours and it can get a little noisy around 9pm onwards. Has been a regular hangout for me. Perfect place for a guys night out. They should have more promotions.

Casual, local spot with tap and bottled beer. (As well as liquor &wine. I just had beer). My fish and Chips was excellent. Very light and fluffy. Friendly staff and a comfortable place make this a great find. Try it!!!

Don't Bother making the trip to JOO CHIAT to have a drink here .I was there at 5pm and as i entered …the staff were on their phones and refused to even entertain me.Sat inside and asked if he could turn the AC on - they replied = NO.Had to signal to 2 waiters who were on their phones just to order a beer . The Waiter was more engrossed in his MACDONALDS delivery .- SEE PHOTO Alll the time i was there 1 waiter sat at the BAR eating MACDONALDS and playing games on his phone .- SEE PHOTO .Enough said - NEVER AGAIN

I stop by this lovely little hole in the wall a couple of times a week. The dog and I pause for a draught Aspell - a crisp, slightly sharp cider - and for him a bowl of water, which the staff put down with a friendly scratch of his ear.A crappy rectangular box adorned with tacky English pub etchings and puns, crowded with tables, chairs a long dark wood bar, and at the entrance, some barrels. It doesn’t look like much, but on a busy night the atmosphere is village friendly and relaxed. They have an extensive list of ciders, and a great range of richly flavored bottled beers and bitters. Throw a bowl of chips in amongst it and I often wonder why I bother going into the city for the bright lights and the big show at all.The Cider Pit is great. If you’re out in JooChiat, you should definitely stop by

My daughter and I ate dinner at Cider Pit. Although I do enjoy cider, I opted for Stone Go-To-IPA on tap. $22 SGD for a stein of craft beer is a pretty good deal for Singapore.My daughter had the fish and chips for $15. The barramundi had the perfect amount of batter and tasted great. I had the greek salad, which was fine, but not big enough to have as a main dish. I felt that for $12 it should have been bigger.The service was friendly and the place has a simple, casual atmosphere. Prices include GST and no service charge is assessed. We'll be back

The Cider was excellent, loved it. Also did try the Badger beer which was ok when compared to CIDER. The place is good, however the restaurant should have good ventilation, despite being open at the front, it was too hot to sit inside. Fans were not effective

So my friends and I stumbled upon The Cider Pit one lazy saturday day. It was a sweltering 36 degrees and I was craving a cider. I usually only find apple or pear...but this place just spaced me. I was like a kid at a candy store. They have dozens ciders/beers to choose from - and the best part is that they let you taste it. I would recommend the Toffee Apple in a cold glass with ice. It was refreshing and chilled out. It is a great place to visit if you are a cider/beer enthusiast. Located in Katong, fairly easy to access. Definitely value for money

Great beer and cider choices at great prices. But the barman had his fingers inside my glass as he handed it to me. And he'd just been cleaning stuff from tables. Ugh!

Went few times there...
Beer/drinks were ok but staff is rude!
They take your chair away if it's close to midnight. Maybe there's no need for money..

Nice collections of Cider. Wide variety. The ambience is good with nice food served. They serve usually all liquor but do not serve cocktails.

We were staying at a hotel in the same road and couldn't believe our lucky that this cider bar was in the same street. There is a large selection of draft cider which come in 3 sizes half pint, pint and a stein as well as bottled ciders. We visited here a couple of times and the food is great too, the gammon was superb

Being an Englishman with a taste for quality cider travelling around Asia it had been months since a decent cider had passed my lips. This place had plenty to choose from including my favourite, westons vintage reserve! I drank far too much and slept like a log after. What a ge

Came here at about 10pm with some friends and couldn't get a seat yet but were told we were going to get one soon. Service was amazing and quick, ambience is great as well for catchup sessions and such. Smoking area available and toilet's at the back! Overall price of ciders are quite decent. Half-pint $5.50 Pint 10.00 and etc. Gst absorbed and no service charges! Will come back again with more friends! Cheers!

Cider Pit has a very large beer menu, predominantly from the UK. I generally stick to a couple of common favourites, as they sometimes do not have some of the more uncommon ones. The same goes for the food menu, they are usually out of something or the other. It is a no frills pub with no service charge, staff are a little under-trained but it all adds to the experience. All in all, a fun place to have drink

As neighborhood and no frills as can be, The Cider Pit offers a wide variety of cider and a decent range of beer. Can be packed and noisy on weekends but with such low prices, it's not surprising. If all you want is a cold cider and no frills, this is yr place. Pub nosh available too.. but then again, one is spoiled for food choices in this stree

The wife and I were looking for some decent European food instead of the frogs and cats that were on offer elsewhere! We accidentally stumbled on the cider pit while walking on Joo Chiat road.The food and the ambience is great. It's super laid back. We ordered a chicken breast which was heavenly and the beer battered fries did not disappoint.Super little place with good food and yet I would not have even dreamt to see something like this amidst all the Asian places here,Highly recommended and quite affordable :)5/5

This little spot hidden in joo chiat serves you wonderful ciders and beers and very reasonable prices. The food on the menu are good too. However, maybe one suggestion could be hiring more staff as i can see that some of your staffs get really fustrated when during peak hours

Nice ambience for chilling out. But Beer was served without a chilled glass. Staff was unfriendly and very rude. No proper way of taking order. We felt unwelcome at all. Never visit this place anymore.

Stopped in for a quick drink before dinner at Napli Gusto.
Has an extensive selection of ciders and beers available and offers a nice and relaxed environment with outdoor seating as well.

Popped in for a couple of ciders after eating at local Thai Restaurant. House cider (Aspall) was $S10 a pint and there was great range of ciders available on the drink list. Meals were also available.

Beer start at 5,50s$ glas. Many beer for try and enjoy with friends. Feeling great. Boss friendly. Have food too. I go next again

Very good bar with plenty of Choice of Ciders and beers nothing startling to look at but good place to sit and watch the world go by. Good menu with Basic food good prices for food and Drink for Singapore will definitley return.

Enjoyed the Cider PIt because it had a lot of different cider and beer alternatives on offer. Didn't feel overly exploited on the prices either.

I'm from Australia & I love my cider so we called in for a few different ciders & I wasn't let down at all... The place was full, service was excellent & the ciders were awesome!!! Great place to just chill, relax enjoy a cider!! Well done & great concept, not to many like this in Singapore!!

My friends and I visited Cider Pit for a get-together. We found the range of ciders and beers being offered to be pretty decent. The prices are quite reasonable as well. However, we found the food items to be rather limited. This can definitely be an area for improvement. We arrived at about 7pm and noticed that the place gets more and more crowded as the night progresses. The place was pretty much packed when we left at about 10pm. Parking is free in front of the shop for those fortunately enought to get a space. Otherwise, there is a pretty big public carpark in the vincinity. Overall a pleasant experience

I am a big fan of cider and I went there with a friend two days ago. Their cider comes in several kinds and sizes which are really good and the price is very reasonable. I recommend the Aspall cider as it is not sweet and has a tinge of citrus in the flavor. Parking is a bit difficult but it sure is worth the trip. We had onion rings and chips with chili beef salsa which were ok. Cider-wise I'd give this place 4 stars

We spent a few weeks in Singapore, and a friend took us here for a night! What an awesome bar!! They stock so many different ciders and beer, even Adnams which is brewed just up the road from us in the UK. Would definitely recommend heading here for an evening! Good food, reasonably priced food too :
