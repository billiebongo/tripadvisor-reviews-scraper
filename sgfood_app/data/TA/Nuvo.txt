Managed to book lunch through eatigo 50% promotion. We were late, as we couldn't find the restaurant. Restaurant was kind to hold our table and honour the promotion. We ordered Momotaro Trio Bruschetta, Pan Roasted Shiro Salmon, 120 Day Grain-Fed Beef Tenderloin. Love the olive favour of the Bruschetta. Salmon was thick, succulent and juicy. Beef tenderloin was tender and simply yummy!

Came here for lunch today. Prices are considerably more expensive than in the previous location at Marina Square, but then probably so is the rent. Food is good. I had the black cod for main which was very tasty, but I was still a bit hungry afterwards as the portion was quite small. My lunch companion opted for the salmon which came with a much larger allocation of sides

This place been relocated to new address ; #01-04 Customs House, 70 Collyer Quay, 049323We went to this place for dinner last night. When we first stepped in there was no hi or hello and no smile. We told them we already booked it. They asked me when did I made my reservation which I told them that I booked 1 days in advance. No one could find my booking. The place looks almost empty on Friday night anyway. We got the table and order ;1 bottle of red wine which taste really OFF. We refused to take it and try other brand of chianti which was fine. It wasn't the full body chianti that we normally got but it's taste a thousand times better than the first bottle. 1 Cold Cut Platter which came with dried beef, chorizo, Apple ham, prosciutto, green & black olives and a few pieces of veggies pickle. This order was absolutely delicious. 1 Pan Roasted Shiro Salmon which salmon skin was very crispy, meat part very sweet and juicy. The baked potato skin that came with was crispy outside inside was tender and sweet. This ordered was quite good. 1 Rigatoni Pasta which pasta perfectly cooked at al dente. The sauce full of flavor and nice aroma. This order also quite good. The service was weird since our stepped in, my face turned from smiley to a grumpy face. We did talk about bad service quality here openly and I also stated that will definitely have to share with local reviews sites and here. Then, one of waiter who's heard about it start to came over and repeat to pour our bottle of wine. We said Thank you a few time there was none reply or even smile. At the end, I saw all those gentlemen waiters standing by the bar smiling and laughing on their own joke. I understand that this is the prime location right on the banking district. They probably did well enough on the day time and do no care for night time customers. That was we guess why service quality was really poor. I'm generous enough to gave this place 4 stars mainly for food which really deserved to be 5*. The ambiance indoor was nice. Outdoor seating with the great view on Marina Bay. If it wasn't humid last night we would love to sit outside and enjoy the view too. It's Sadly for business owner to have a crew who had zero interested into the customers.

On a Friday night of a long weekend Singapore was packed with evening revelers. After exhausting a few other places as too crowded and noisy we took a chance on this Italian/Japanese restaurant in a mall. Two small pieces of bread with soft butter were presented after we sat down, they were a highlight. They should be less stingy with the bread given the high prices. The eggplant parmesan was an interesting cross of Italian and Japanese as it was tempura battered (it should have been peeled) The food is good and nicely presented, the steak was excellent. The lobster risotto was flavorful risotto, the lobster was distinctly absent. The staff was clearly not trained, taking our silverware after our Appetizer and laying them on the table, they seemed more interested in closing up for the night and it was only about 9:30.Not bad, but I would not select this restaurant

I was intrigued by the classification of food, as they call themselves Italian-Japanese fusion. We went for lunch and food was pretty good. A weird smoked uni carbonara pasta was pretty good, but the better dish was a lamb shank which is neither Italian nor Japanese. We went for lunch (I don't recommend it for dinner) and price was o

I was staying in the Marina area recently and found this place completely by accident. I was alone and jet lagged, so wanted a light meal without much effort. I was extremely impressed by the preparation of the Sea Bass and perfect balance of seasoning. I had a good vantage point into the open kitchen, and was impressed by the hardworking, organized chefs as they put out some beautiful dishes.The service was absolutely on-point, and the lead waiter anticipated every need.Definitely a diamond in the rough, and highly recommended if looking for something adjacent to the Marina Mandarin

Been back here twice recently for the $15++ set lunch. For the price the quality of the food is decent, but the service could do with some improvement. Starters are delivered quickly enough, but on both my recent visits the main course took quite some time to arrive, and it was only with some rushing that we were able to make it back to the office by 2pm. That said, this is still a great choice for lunch in the area. Wine prices are also quite reasonable

We went here as a back up option because we didn't have a reservation for the place we really wanted to go. The food was ok, not terrible, but not great. The appearance of the restaurant was cool. It's right across from the mall bathrooms so you could constantly hear the hand dryer. If you're just in Singapore for a few days, don't waste a meal here

12 of us got together at Nuvo, a new-ish Italian-Japanese restaurant, for a family reunion and birthday celebration last Sunday, and it proved to be a really great choice in a city that is already chockablock with good eateries and restaurants.As we were there on a Sunday, we enjoyed their Prosecco Brunch that, at S$40++ a head, proved to be fantastic value for the quality of food and the free flow of Prosecco, Mimosas and Bellinis that accompanied the meal. The Brunch menu comprised a selection of pizzas, pastas and yakitori, and though pizza, pasta and yakitori on print sounds pretty ordinary and even boring, the Italian-Japanese selection provided at Nuvo proved otherwise. Diners can choose any dish from the Brunch menu, and every single item we ordered (which was practically the entire Brunch menu since there were 12 of us!) was a surprise and an utter delight in taste and sight. Every order was freshly and individually prepared, thereby ensuring quality at the right temperature. The pizzas were excellent, with nice crusts and interesting and tasty toppings (like the unusual and delicious toasted kelp), and they looked really pretty too. The pastas were not only al dente, they went beyond the usual Italian flavours, and though onsen egg and uni infused broth may sound odd, they actually work and provide interest and depth to the standard and ubiquitous pasta dish. The yakitori were fine too, and were more dainty than the usually robust yakitori one gets in a Japanese restaurant. Everything had a more-ish quality, and we enjoyed the food so much that we asked to order from their a la carte menu, which proved to be a good choice, as the the lamb shank was the melt-in-your-mouth kind and one of the best we have ever had, and the uni-infused angel hair pasta was superb.The free flow Prosecco, Mimosas and Bellinis were a nice touch, and I must say that their Bellini is way better than the rip-off ones served at Harry's Bar in Venice!Nuvo was less than half full when we were there, and I hope they get more patrons for their excellent Prosecco Brunch on weekends, as they more than deserve a full house for the great food, good quality ingredients, and friendly and accommodating service. On our part, we were glad that we could not get a table for the Ritz Carlton Sunday Brunch which was our original choice, as Nuvo turned out to be a great fallback at a fraction of what we would have had to pay at the Ritz Carlton. Big thank you, Nuvo
