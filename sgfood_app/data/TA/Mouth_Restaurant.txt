Service is good but the claim for the fave coupon is limited. There are lots of restrictions for dinner and thus limited choices. If I have come for lunch, there will be more choices from dim sum.

Every dish was delicious - my guests from the USA felt they had never eaten such wonderful Chinese food.

We came to Mouth Restaurant for their signature rainbow dumplings and nothing quite lived up to the expectations . First of all service was atrocious and staff didn't really seem to have much product knowledge. When asked if the dumpling skins were dyed using natural or artificial ingredients, and whether they have different fillings, at least 3 staff members didn't know the answer. A male manager was called over and he looked equally puzzled, then told us "skin was all the same, just different colours". Until this other lady came to explain that natural ingredients were used to colour the skins and that you could actually taste the differences, that guy looked surprised and slightly embarrassed since he just got busted for making up information . Anyway colouring agents are as followed:White: ☁️ uncolouredPurple: sweet potatoGreen: spinachYellow: pumpkinBlack: squid inkOrange: carrotFYI fillings in all dumplings were the same, just the skin colours were different. Perhaps they should rename it to < 6 Colour > instead of 6 Flavour then. They weren't even that special to be honest. The skin was good, soft and had just enough elasticity to hold its shape but I couldn't identify any taste distinction amongst the coloured dough. The filling was well-seasoned but a tad dry, needed more fat in there to balance out the firmness. Considering the experience as a whole, we're definitely not coming back. Not for dumplings, and definitely not for service. ⛔

After a 20 min wait while a large party vacated the restaurant, we were shown to a free table. This is a popular restaurant with a traditional family atmosphere. The dim sim were above average with a good selection of interesting combinations and attentive service. No toilet on the premises which we thought a little odd for an establishment of this quality. But overall an enjoyable lunch, we would return

We had a fave voucher and a little surprised when advised we couldn't otrder off the menu because if this. Joe was very helpful and pointed us to several options on the slip menu that was offered. The food ( deep fried Vietnamese rolls, char siew pork, roasted duck, salted egg prawn balls and seafood rice) was good, not great but certainly tasty enough generally except the Vietnamese deep fried spring rolls, these are nothing but hollow deep fried skins and certainly overpriced for what they are. Apart from the seafood fried rice the duck and pork certainly seemed like they were cooked some time being served as such overdone and dry.The highlight was Joe who was a pleasure to be served by and very helpful. The Dishes are not cheap but yes, I'd come back, perhaps at lunch to ensure fresh mealsI'm unable to complete the events below but I'd score the service a 5, food and value 3

Traditional chinese restaurant that is perfect for family gatherings, especially with kids and the elderly. Booked the private room to celebrate Grandpa's birthday and had a great time catching up with the relatives. The place is clean and the service provided is good as well. We ordered Set B and the food are surprisingly delicious, particularly the crispy salted egg yolk bun

My wife and I chose Mouth because it was close and had a better than average rating. The food was out of this world, the pork belly starter was a hit of the bat, the tofu and mushrooms was delicious as was the egg gravy noodles. The thing that got my attention was the big intestines. The outside tasted like pork crackling, the insides was a juicy fatty jelly substance - yup words escape me. It looks like something that shouldn't be on a plate but it was worth a try. I managed half the dish. The older servers were amazed that we ate it, they were so attentive after that it was slightly embarrassing. Eat what the locals eat and they will take you into their hearts and make you feel welcome. Even if you eat like a tourist you will be fed well and leave feeling well sated

Totally enjoyed my afternoon dining at Mouth restaurant... Very good service, reasonably priced, can't really fault anything. Not a fan of the famous Liu Sha bao... But it is a better ones I have tried. The kids love the Xiao long bao! Had to order 5 baskets between the three of them.

Celebrated early Mother's Day lunch at the restaurant. 3 fantastic dishes (amongst many) that are truly memorable:1. 'Phoenix' fish - beautifully deep fried with a unique side of egg white. Quite distinctive from the usual Cantonese style deep fried soon hock2. Shark fin cartilage - we were not keen on the shark fin soup but the manager suggested this as an alternative and it did not disappoint! Texture like fish maw in a wonderful thick broth3. Salted custard bun (Liu sa pow) - I'll return just for this dish alone. Must be eaten hot, perfect mix of salted egg yolk and custard. Yummy!All in all, my friend's recommendation was spot on and the meal was one of the best we've had in a long while.Highly recommende

We had dinner here on a Saturday evening.The staff who served us were friendly and prompt. The dishes we ordered tasted reasonably good. The prices here are slightly higher than average.Would have rated the restaurant higher if not for the following details:We wanted to order fried eggs for our kids, and we asked the staff about it because those were not listed in their menu. The staff, after probably making inquiries with their supervisor, came back and said they can offer several options. However, when we asked about the price (we didn't want any surprises), they said that each large portion would cost S$24!! Either they were using golden eggs, or they were clearly out for extortion! Each egg could not have cost them more than S$0.10 (probably much less, because they would have ordered in bulk), and even if they use 10 eggs per portion, it would not have cost more than S$1. Even if they factor in labor and other cost, it would not have justified the S$24 price tag.We ordered Roasted Peking Duck. It is normal (and expected) that restaurants would bring the roasted duck out and carve out the skin at the presence of diners. However, they did not do this here. The duck skin were simply brought out from the kitchen already prepared. There was no way for us to know if the skin were freshly carved off a roasted duck, or if they've given us everything from the duck, or whether they've mixed the skins from different batches of roasted ducks.While we were there, another group have apparently booked several tables to celebrate someone's birthday. However, the group was not in a partitioned-off area, so whatever they did was in full view of the other diners. This would have been fine if not for the fact that they were playing loud music, and the restaurant's speakers were pointed towards all the other diners (i.e. us) and away from that group! So we had to endure loud music during our dinner!Overall, while the food might be reasonably good, we feel that the restaurant still have room for improvement

Had reasonable dim sum in this mediocre Chinese restaurant , in awkward location , just off China Square Mall. The beef dumplings were disappointing. Nothing to rave about
4
Had lunch here in a big group of 13 pax. The dim sum is pretty good. Esp. Love the egg tarts and cha siew so. Carrot cake in XO is also nice. Worth a visit.
4
Been here with my family for lunch and I must say this is a good choice to relish on a wide array of dim sum choices. Decent Chinese food with excellent desserts.
4
We ordered 7 different dim sum dishes and all were very good, our favorite was the lava bun, I'm going to be dreaming about it for a long time. The service was also excellent.
4
It is located inside the CBD and the absence of a large crowd on a Saturday meant that we do not have to wait for our seats and we always get the attention of the service staff. My friends enjoyed most of the dim sum dishes and especially the Liu Sha Buns. The furniture and the decorations have seen their better days. Hey, who cares as Long as the food is tasty and the prices are reasonable
3
We visited on a Public Holiday afternoon and were glad we made reservations as it was full with queues. The quality was generally good and i personally love the caroot cake, char siew bao and Liu Sha Bao. The other dishes were a hit and miss. A big no no to order is the roast duck, roast pork and charsiew combination. It was pretty bad as the pork had a smell and it just doesn't taste good. Service was reasonably good considering how busy the restaurant was. However, when we ordered a 2nd round of dishes, it took ages to come! So that wasn't very pleasant. It was like we were forgotten!Nice place for big groups and gatherings. However if you want good quality dim sum, you can probably find it somewhere else with the same price that you are paying

it's long time i never been this restaurant after they shifted to China Square there. I been there twice within 2 months for dim sum because the dim sum quality is good. Delicious. My friend and I , two of us, we usually order max 4 to 5 dim sum. It is really very enough for us. Overall all dim sum are good, only steam Pork Ribs w Blended Black Bean was under expectation. My favourite dish is Sauteed Char Siew & Prawn Rice Roll in X.O. I have recommended this to my friend and they also like this very much. This taste like carrot cake but actually is rice roll.  Steam Har Gao, steam siew mai are good too, the filling are very fresh with thin skin, Baked Salted Egg Yolk Bun, Steam Char Siew Bao (bun) not bad. Overall all dim sum are good, only steam Pork Ribs w Blended Black Bean is under expectation. All my friends know I like steam Pork Ribs w Blended Black Bean very much, every time I eat dim sum I will sure order this steam pork ribs but I never order after my first try. Not no good ,just I have high expectation on this dish. We not ordered so much and we spent about S$45++ . This price is reasonable for us and I willing to pay for the food because it’s one of the delicious dim sum in my list

One of the best restaurant in Singapore you must visit! They create quality dishes using healthy ingredients. extremely great food, highly affordable price and the best service.This restaurant surprised me with innovations in the dim sum scene that actually works and their dim sum tastes super delicious! My clients were shocked by the Mouth’s Peacock Fish tastes, culinary “crafted” by our Hong Kong chefs, the fish is deep fried and coated with their superior stock.One of the must-order signature items at Mouth Restaurant are the irresistible salted egg yolk buns. With a crust that's soft like polo buns and inside containing salted egg molten, it totally screams of indulgence and decadence.It's always full during lunch time, so try to be there slightly early
4
I visited Mouth specifically to try their famous liu sha bao and was certainly not disappointed - they were without a doubt one of the most delicious things I have ever eaten. A crusty sweet coating giving way to a glorious rush of golden salted egg custard - I can't really imagine how this dish could possibly be better; in fact I went back the very next day for another helping. I also tried some deep fried pork intestine, which was likewise delicious - but the liu sha bao on their own are more than enough reason to go

With ala carte or set menus, there's a wide variety of choice of cantonese food. Generally quality of above average, with staples and poultry being more flavourful and fragrant, just like good 'ol chinese cooking normally are.E-fu Noodles are especially good, and strong fire cooking is evident in the aromas and mouth feel with every bite. The noodles would be a recommended dish of the restaurant even though it's lacking in meat, but just vegetables and mushrooms as condiments, just for the flavour itself. It can feed 4 persons comfortably. $16Chardonnay prawns(no idea what goes into the sauce) was delicious too, with 10 plump prawns and a creamy dressing, keeps us going back for more servings. Totally wiped out the dish in minutes. $26Suckling Pig Trio consists of pig skin, roasted duck, and roasted pork. WhHile the roast duck was pretty good, the pork was average and the pig skin a little disappointing without the good crackle it should bring to the table. Feeds 4 pax easily too. $38Vegetables was done to a crisp, fresh green, which means there's no overcooking and the fire was adjusted to just the right temperature. With simple garlic gravy, was refreshing yet satisfying. Feeds 3, $12Worth a revisit, with service prompt but can be curt at times. Decor is predominantly red as if there's a chinese wedding going on perpetually, with 2 private rooms for bigger parties
5
Must eat! Excellent food, good price, heavenly experience at the restaurant.
Try locate it near China Town, you're will not be sorry.
4
Although I'm not Asian I do eat in a lot of Chinese restaurants. This one was very enjoyable. Food came fast and portions were fine. Typically busy and happening place. Even in the day. Would definitely go again.

Mouth Restaurant serves good dim sum in the traditional way and I quite like it especially it opens at 10am in the morning during weekends. Having morning dim sum breakfast is widely practised by Cantonese. You won't feel too oily in the dim sum and it's famous Liu Sha Bao is of course a must-try because of its crispy skin and the running yolk. It's at Hong Kong standard and you should try if you're home sick for proper Cantonese dim sum.The service is of good standard in Singapore and the waiters / waitresses are smart, attentive and with prompt response and these attitudes are lacking in many restaurants here
5
Definitely the best liu sha bao or as they call it in the menu " Top 10 Baked Cream of Salted Egg Yolk bun"!! This is the only one that I know which bakes this bao rather than steaming it. The lightly crisp covering enhances the creamy smooth filling. Sip the fragrant chrysanthemum tea as you delight in the bao. The other dim sum items are good too but definitely must not miss the liu sha bao!Service is brusque but prompt and efficient.

I was there with friends and mid way through the dinner I decided to use the restroom located in the same building. I could believe that I saw the waitress went into the cubicle, did her thing and left without washing her hands??? thought of using the sink in the restaurant kitchen but that is unacceptable if you're handling food to customers. We never came back since..
5
This restaurant serve the white chicken the Samsui style with ginger dip and grounded chives instead of chilli. Samsui women used to be our treasured gem as these women laid the bricks of our buildings with their bare hands ! Soups of your choice are also offered and other stir fried dishes are on the menu for your selection.
4
I'm a regular ..and I must say after over 5 years of dim sum lunches ..I'm still enjoying the food ...the set lunches and dinners are great too ..and very often ..special promotions ..so if you want real tasty dim sum ..can come by here ..and after your feast ..you can walk it off at Chinatown ..which is a stone throw away ....enjoy ..

If you are hankering after dim sum from the 60's or if you want to bring your parents to reminisce dim sum from the 60's, you can visit Mouth Restaurant for the new ' Nostalgic Canton Dim Sum' which is a 9 course dim sum menu specially created and only available from now till Jan 2015. It cost $24.80++ per pax with a minimum of 4 pax. Here are the dishes that we savoured:1) Dumpling in Double-Boiled Winter melon Chicken Soup:- Birdnest and Chicken minced meat: Served as a green dumpling in the soup. Wished there was more bird nest in it, so I can taste the bird nest. Good for ladies!- Hashima and Crabmeat: Orange dumpling. Chockful of crabmeat. Awesome flavour. 2) Steamed Chicken Siew Mai with mushroom, asparagus, turnip and wolfberry: Presentation was nice. I found the asparagus too fibrous and wished they had removed the skin of the asparagus. Else it was ok. 3) Steamed Hairy Gourd with Minced Chicken Meat, Water Chestnut and Conpoy in Oyster Sauce: Hairy gourd as a base and topped with minced chicken mix. This reminded me of my early childhood, when my mum prepared this dish at home. Great memories! 4) Steamed 3 Colors Crystal Dumpling in 3 Flavours: Good presentation, each person had 1 type of 'colored' dumpling served in a dim sum container.- The clear dumpling had straw mushrooms and ham, The orange dumpling had diced button mushrooms and the green dumpling had egg white, crab meat and truffle oil.The green dumpling was the best! 5) Deep Fried Taro-Coated Prawn in Blended Oyster Sauce: Fresh prawns coated with mash yam and deep fried till crispy. Very good. The oyster sauce that went it had diced mushrooms and scallions in it and complimented the prawns and taro. 6) Deep Fried Dumpling with Fresh Prawn & Char Siew in Sweet & Sour Sauce: Think wanton served with sweet and sour fried prawns and char siew. The wantons were crispy and went well with the sauce. The serving of the prawns and char siew was also like an 'ala carte' order. Good sized portions. 7) Pan Fried Glutinous Rice with Chicken Meat & Mushroom in XO Sauce: You know lotus leaf glutinous rice with fillings? This is now pan-fried and served with XO sauce on the side. It was crispy on the outside and the inside fillings included the usual salted egg, diced mushrooms and stewed meat. Eating with XO sauce gave it a different dimension. Not bad! 8) Braised Beancurd Skin Roll with Chicken Meat, Mushroom, Fish Maw and Luncheon Meat: My favourite dish for the meal. Instead of plain steaming, this was served in a superior stock, which tasted like 'cream of chicken soup'. Excellent, and unlike the ones you get at other dim sum restaurant. Must-try! 9) Legendary Baked Cream of Salted Egg Yolk Bun: Baked instead of the usual steamed ones you get at other restaurants. Very yummy! The meal was very filling, despite my lunch kakis' worry that being dim sum, the food will not be enough to fill their stomachs. We left the restaurant very full

I had dinner with my family on 19 July about 7.45pmSurprising there are less than 10 occupied tables Suckling Pig ang Roast Duck Platter, heavy porky smell and duck was dry and tough. Fried noodle has the Used Cooking oil smell. Fried Prawn roll below average. Stir Fried Broccoli, HK Kai Lan and egg plant taste average

I dined there for business dinner. The food was better than expected and all the guests enjoyed the feast. I like the beef dish. It was cooked well, but still tender and jucy.The food taste is mild and good for the guests who are not fun of spicy food. The servce is prompt and the price is reasonable. Recommended for foreigners who are sick of chilli and spices
2
Didn't enjoy the food or service very much today.
Could find better within 10mins walking distance.
Second time here at this outlet, but probably will be my last

Had make a booking a day before for 2 tables 10 peoples each and a $200 deposit was requied by them.Reached 10 mins early but was ask to come back on time at 1pm.Only 1 table of 10 peoples was given after 15 mins and get the next table after 35mins later. All the earlier having their lunch at about 2pm.No apologize was given for the poor arrange time.Will inform all fridends all relatives not to visit this restaurant

Excellent Dim Sum. We are visiting Singapore on business. We returned 3 times in 2 weeks. My boyfriend is Cantonese and very particular about dim sum. This is one of the best dim sum we have had. Unlike other comments, the service was wonderful. The staff was very friendly, attentive and polite without being intrusive . Our tea and water was always refilled without being asked. Plates very switched timely. The food was excellent and came out regularly. Dim sum was piping hot and good potion sizes. Must definitely try the custard buns. By far my favorite in Singapore

For more reviews, visit my blog at ms-skinnyfatMouth Restaurant was first established in the 80s in Chinatown Point and is known for its well made Cantonese Dim Sum. The tea house, which originally served delicate pieces of steamed dumplings, has gone on to provide more cooked dishes at its current China Square Central and Plaza Singapura outlets in Singapore.We went in search of some Salted Egg Yolk Custard buns, which Mouth Restaurant is famous for. Managed to snag a table for dim sum on Saturday noon. We were lucky to get a table despite the last minute reservation.Century Egg and Shredded Pork Porridge is one of my standard dimsum order. Nice gluey texture of the congee with generous amount of pork. 4 of us shared a portion in order to make space for more food.Shanghai Xiao Long Bao, Har Gao (Steamed Prawn Dumplings), and Spare Ribs in garlic and chili. All great dishes. The Xiao Long Bao skin was sufficiently thin and encased the juicy pork meat in a robust broth. Har Gao was big, fresh and juicy (i can never resist prawns). The ribs were well marinated and flavorful as well. Mouth Restaurant also offers Colored Har Gao instead of the typical Colored Xiao Long Bao and they are Squid Ink, Spinach, Sweet Potato, Pumpkin, Carrot and Original. The Pan Fried Carrot Cake (another of my favorite dim sum item) was nicely browned and lightly crisp on the outside. The springy texture is just what i look for in a good carrot cake. Oh and the delicious strips of turnip and preserved Chinese sausages (lup cheong) had me finish most of this myself.The Steamed Rice Roll with Fresh Prawn aka Cheong Fun was alright. It's not that they weren't good, the skin was silky but perhaps thicker than what i prefer. Prawns were great as usual but the sauce was a little bland in my opinion. Now now, the reason why we went to Mouth Restaurant. Here's the baked Salted Egg Yolk Bun (3pcs per set) Mind you, they run out fast. Just look at that lovely Hong Kong Bo Lo crust made from sugar, butter and milk powder. It's hard to believe that this is baked because the crust is so crunchy.Be careful how you bite into the bun. Be warned that the piping viscous, creamy, savory and sweet lava may just erupt in your mouth and potentially over your plate, and shirt, and your fellow diners' shirts. It may be a little on the greasy end but the flavor was spot on.Head on to Mouth Restaurant for a classic dim sum fix this weekend! Forgot the prices but it was about S$75 for 4 pax

Even though they have the same parents, how the kids have turned out are completely different. Mouth has a restaurant in China Square, Chinatown and a restaurant in Singapore Plaza, Dhoby Gault. The menus between the 2 are very different and so is the quality unfortunately. Although it's not as well located as its sister or as well dressed, the food in China Square is first class whereas Singapore Plaza is only mediocre. All the dishes are amazing but the sweet and sour chicken stands out.

Was at Mouth Rest 24/11/13 for Tim Sum.Everything goes well, service is good, no doubt you can find more other races serving you rather than Chinese or Singaporean in a Chinese Rest, but that's fine, food only average.. BUT when come to 1 of the dish was served wrong to our table, I took a piece & realized is was not the dish that we've ordered, so I highlight to them. Ok, they apologies & realized it's for the next table, so they sent it to the next table with that piece missing... even after I've told them that I have touched the plate. Oh my GOD... how can this be happening, I just can't believe it.. well, they can do behind the Kitchen, but not in the floor where I've been watching them. So.. please, in future when having Tim Sum, please watch where you food coming from.

The food was reasonably good but service was bad.... staff not sure of credit card promotion. There was a one for one promo on Liu Sa Pau and after paying, we realise they did not give us the one for one offer ..when we checked with the staff for it, the staff gave us the free pau unwillingly..

My wife and I visited for her birthday meal. Unfortunately, the ambiance was a little off as we were the only diners there at 8.0pm. Where we too early or too late?We had the succulent pig set meal. Good value at S$88 and 2 for 1. The food was very nice but the Durian fruit at the end was somewhat of a challenge, although they did provide a mango alternative.We enjoyed our meal but would have liked a bit more atmosphere that a bigger crowd would have brought.The only down side is that it does not have any toilets. You need to go outside and use the public toilets around the corner
4
My family of 6 visited the restaurant as there was the credit card 1 for 1 promo during that time. I was at first skeptical over the choices we have as the 1 for 1 promo gave us very limited options.However, my impression changed once the dishes arrived. Dishes like Buddha jump over the wall, Sakura chicken, and fried rice were delicious. The chilled cream of purple sweet potato with ice cream dish was a refreshing and original dessert as not tasted elsewhere. In addition to the set meal, my family ordered some Dim Sum to complement the dishes. The Har Kao and Siew Mai were delicious, so was the chicken feet.One thing though, it could get pretty busy on weekends and the waitresses will take some time to respond though they did acknowledge our calls. Would love to visit the restaurant again for more meaty dishes

Brought my family here for my mums birthday celebration yesterday. Overheard my mum saying that this restaurant has a long history in singapore. Anyway...Ordered the set menu for the price of $168++ for 4 pax, though we only have 3 of us. The shark fins soup was filled with crab meats and just nice for the taste bud in terms of saltiness. Then came the Peking duck which I must comment for the tender meat and crispy skin. Later on, the remaining duck was used to cook up a dish, gong bao duck which was fragrant and tasty. It's my first time trying gong bao duck and I must say that they did a really good job. After frying, the meat was still tender and soft. Another commendable dish was the thousand island cod which my wife loved. The fish was cooked to perfection without getting too heavy on the taste. As for the fried bee hoon at the end, was too full to carry on anymore and thus, may be the reason why I felt that the fried bee hoon was pretty average. The waitress was thoughtful enough to give us different mango desserts to try at the end. Frankly, one of the better Chinese restaurant in singapore
