Avoid at all costs! There are no redeeming qualities of this so called restaurant. Disinterested service and mediocre food at best!

We had a fantastic time with friends, eating outside on the breeze. We shared all the dishes. The service is fast and good. Prepare to eat with your hands.
Great value and tasty dishes.

We love this restaurant it’s staff are attentive and quick,the meal is always well presented and tasty. The wine is a decent price unlike other restaurants in Singapore.

A small restaurant in the Arab Street. The food is authentic and service is awesome. Don't forget to try the sweet dish kunefe, its great.

Food and service distinctly average. Went there for a night out having read some good reviews and was a little disappointed. In particular the salad wasn't very fresh, the rice portion for two wasn't great. Meat was nicely cooked but I'll look for somewhere different in the area next time.
5
It's a nice place with a good service and very fresh made and tasty food. You can have a really nice experience in the turkish cuisine there!I recommend the lamb and cheese bread, the mix of appetizers served with the delicious turkish bread and the apple tea

I dropped by the restaurant on a Saturday afternoon lunch, and the restaurant was quiet, with a pleasant atmosphere, lit by Turkish lamps and with decorative ornaments on the wall. We ordered Baba Ganoush, Turkish Pizza and an all-in-one karisik kebab platter. The food was very good overall, and the Turkish Pizza and beef kebab were standouts. The bread and Baba Ganoush pairing were tasty as well. The bill racked up to about S$25 per person, which was reasonably priced considering the sampling of chicken, beef and lamb (I have my fair share of balking at overpriced dining in Singapore, and the bill felt cheap). Service was good, but we were literally the only other table in the restaurant, so it dosen't say much
5
Stopped by here as it opened for lunch at 12.15pm with my family. Incredible service and the food was amazing. Started with a $27 mixed dips and bread platter with lava bread. We then each had a mixture of lamb and chicken kebabs which were equally as amazing. Definitely try the variety of juices as well - we will be back for sure

Arab Street in the heart of Singapore is a fun place. Locals and expats visit it quite a bit, but its also a bit of a tourist trap with a lot of forgettable Turkish, Lebanese and other Middle Eastern restaurants jockeying aggressively with each other to get noticed. Most places are highly overrated like the extremely forgettable Beirut, so we stumbled across Alaturka quite by accident and with very low expectations.One would expect that service at the place given intense competition would be superb but it started off quite badly with the staff debating with me whether three people should sit at a 4-person table or at a 2-person table with an extra chair. Given the place wasn't full I couldn't follow the debate at all, and the restaurant reluctantly concurred. Bad start.The menu was reasonably extensive with the standard Middle Eastern offerings. We ordered hummus and a kebab platter, with a cherry juice for junior. The mark of a good place is the hummus which is either a gooey mess or basically chickpea gravel. This was quite nice, just the right amount of texture with good flavor. It came with a chunky side of bread, which is another place where restaurants usually skimp.Junior's cherry juice was also tart and refreshing. Our expectations perked up considerably. The usual issue with mixed grill type kebab platters is the uneven quality of the different meats. I was at least heartened by the fact that it took some time for the order to arrive, a sign that things were freshly prepared. And finally the platter arrived in a big silver platter, half of which was disappointingly filled with salad and the other half with meat. Good variety of meat: lamb sausage, lab chops, boneless chicken and chicken wings. Besides the chops being slightly overdone, everything was piping hot, fresh and well seasoned. In fact it was delicious and I wished we had ordered more because the platter is maybe a bit small for two big appetite adults.We debated dessert but ended up having ice cream elsewhere. In the end the service also ended up graciously being especially considerate towards my 7-year old. I would definitely come back again, and would recommend this place for a nice plate of kebabs

There are tons of good turkish food places around arab street in singapore. I had heard good things about this one, but found it to be pretty average. The hummus was okay, the bread they served with it looked stale. Would have loved some hot bread with it. The lamb chop my Husband ordered was phenomenal (major food envy!!), however, the lamb kebabs i order were undercooked. When i asked them to sort that out, it came back well cooked, but unfortunately, now chewy! Service was slow, probably they do a better job during dinner time.. (i was there for lunch). It is a really cute little place, perfect for date nights - just stick with the lamb chops! :)

Well intentioned but mediocre service the down side of an otherwise very good restaurant with fresh tasty turkish!

We had a lovely dinner with friends on Friday evening. The restaurant was very packed, in –and outside but we arrived at the right moment when a group of 5 left the restaurant.We ordered to start a Large Meze Tabagi and two Karisik Kebab dishes as main course. All was nicely served and tastyNice atmosphere as there was a live band playing music a little further down the street, but there is very little space, every square inch is occupied to maximize the profit,…
3
Had dinner at Alaturka on a friday night. Tables and chairs that were indoors were either occupied or reserved. Therefore, we were given seats outdoors. Guests that were seated at the tables outside were placed closely next to each other without any privacy. We ordered karisik kebab platter, the meats on the platter tasted pretty average. We also had baklava and it was absolutely sweet and delightful. Would definitely come back again for the baklava
3
Ambience - 4 - as we sat outside on the Bussorah street where the atmosphere was good. Although there was hardly any space for customers to even get into the restaurant because of the number of tables laid out and when we sat, there was hardly any intimacy or privacy coz it seemed we were basically sitting with someone on same table.Service - 2 - the lady who took our order came across as inhospitable. The answers to our questions were a dead no or yes with hardly and smile. There's no flexibility in the menu and when asked if a dish which said beef and lamb could be prepared only with lamb, the answer was an abrupt 'No Can'. Not what we would expect from a gourmand bib awarded restaurant!! What a shame!!Food - we love our Turkish food and are big fans of the kebabs which are very tasty in that part of the world. But here, it was something different. We ordered a meze ya ago and it was pretty apparent that the plate came straight from the fridge which probably sat there was good few hours if not days. The bread was fresh as I guess there is no option for that to be pre-prepared.We then order beyti kebab chicken which was kebab wrapped in bread cut into bite size pieces with tzazaki in middle. Maybe my expectations were too high to think it would have some fresh salad greens or vegetables, which is what we were pretty used to when we had the most awesome kebab in a Turkish restaurant in London.Anyhow, an average experience which was further marred by the indifferent service and food falling short of our basic expectations.Bib Gourmand, not worthy of you unless we have misunderstood value of your accreditation
3
Food was great and I liked the fact that the waitress told us that we initially ordered may have been too much for two . My only issue with the place was that the tables were so close to each other (about 3cm apart - refer to photo ! ) . We asked for another table but the other option was the other option was no better . What irked me was when two walk ins requested for a table of two , and was about to walk away as they didn't want the cramped seating , miraculously the staff gave them another table that (1) wasn't cramped and (2) it was actually proper table and chairs .It felt like we were at a food court - foldable plastic tables and chairs and people standing behind you waiting for you to finish your food .
1
The location is super convenient, the service is friendly and they serve alcohol One problem - the food is crap. The lamb was tough, the kebab was tasteless and the dips were cheesy - I have no reason why, but they taste like cheese. It’s just wrongSorry - this isn’t the kinda place to spend any time
4
Found this place after checking TA for advice on restaurants in this area (there are loads to choose from!) Immediately as I walked in the lady that helped me was very friendly and helpful. The food was very nice and restaurant very comfortable. I had the minced lamb kebab, which they switched the rice for Turkish bread with no complaint. Very nice side salad comes with it. Good stop.
5
We went to Bussorah Street which is adjacent to the Arab Street of Singapore without any expectations. When we hit the Alaturka restaurant it was around threeish in the afternoon and beyond lunch time. So the advantage is that we had the whole restaurant to ourselves and the entire attention of the staff and the proprietor of the hotel Mr. Junaiz. I am always biased towards quiet restaurants and so the quietness and the serene ambiance of the restaurant bowled me off instantly.Of course, I was told that this calmness is due to the odd time that we had visited but normally one will have to wait for a table for considerable time during lunch and dinner times and then there could be some conversational din! :-)What we had experienced has been a fantastic and memorable lunch. The restaurant, though looked small had at least about 10 tables inside, to accommodate about 30 persons and maybe another 10-15 outside in the covered patio / verandah.Being strict vegetarians that we are, we came to this restaurant to try out some Mediterranean vegetarian dishes and we were not disappointed. Mr. Junaiz was quite friendly and helped us choose the dishes with care and also advised on the quantities. The entire array of the vegetarian stuff was delightful. The quantities were optimum. Meze Tabagi is a melange of several dishes very tastefully arranged to be taken in with wheat unleavened bread with ample sesame seeds as topping. The main dishes comprised of Borek, spring rolls, Mousakka and the Imam Bayildi. while Mousakka was good, the Imam Bayildi, which is aubergines / egg plants, stuffed with a concoction of spices and sinking in sauces, was from out of the world. Mousakka and Imam Bayildi are served simmering in their own sauces and juices! Ooh la la la....The desserts Baklava and Kunefe were straight down from heaven. They give unlimited water without any extra charges. The pricing for such a good fare was reasonable to the Singapore standards, we felt.If you are in Singapore, do visit Alaturka once and carry home some gastronomically good memories. Indeed! For sure, you won't be disappointed
3
We visited Alaturka recently and were very disappointed with the service. Our cold platter came very late almost after we have finished the food. We had ordered Lavash and we were told that Lavash is not available. Instead, they gave some random bread. Interestingly, few other customers were being served Lavash, they mentioned that the machine is now working. After asking few times, we got Lavash. Overall, not a place I will return.
2
There were plenty seats inside the restaurant said reserved. But throughout our dinner that took more than an hour, those seats remained unoccupied.We were seated with rocking bad quality table. The decoration of the new shop lot has lost its charm of Turkish style.We were rushed off for bill and leave during the Friday night when there are others walk-in patrons were waiting.Taste of food has changed, the way it is served can no longer meet the quality 1/2 year ago! We miss the service and ambient last time. We were usually served with Turkish tea on the house at the end of our dinners
4
A lovely friendly helpful restaurant. Great value and lovely food. Such a nice experience after so many others that have been disappointing in Singapore.
5
Place is quite small with great ambience. I love the starters and desserts, mains are okay. Try to get a reservation as they are getting busier after Michelin reviewed them.
4
The best Turkish food I've tasted in Singapore. Especially their mutton kebabs (kuzu pirzola), meze tabagi , babaganoush and lavas bred. Waiting go again.
1
Below average food (babaganoush tasted cheesy somehow?!?!) not at all authentic and horrendous prices. Only good thing about this place is it serves alcohol.
4
Great food on the street as the sun set. The Karisik Kebab platter is recommended. Service was mixed although the lead waitress was good.
5
We had a very nice diner at alaturka. Food was authentic and of good quality. I can really recommend the humus, sesame bread and the lamb chops. Very friendly staff as well, we will definetly come again.
3
one of the many joints in the somehow quite touristy Bussorah Street. prices are not extravagant but food wise the performance is limited.A table of 9 we started with 2 plates of mixed mezze, which includes "Russian salad" ? OK babaganouj and hummus, and some other less striking salsas... not really a hot item. main course : i tasted lamb kebab, bot in chunks (too salty, overcooked, but good meat) and shredded (lots of fat). Also not extraordinary.restaurant was rather full and that put service in panic mode : dishes or extra beers were coming at random.just making it to average, but i would look for another table
5
I arranged to have dinner at Alaturka with four friends visiting Singapore. Our reservation was for 7 PM and when I arrived 15 minutes early, the host showed me that our table was ready and I could wait there for my friends. Our host and waiter were gracious, prompt in their service, and alert to our needs. The food was fragrant, delicious and aesthetically presented! The bread and the dishes were warm to our touch and their aroma made our mouths water. We had the large appetizer platter (meze tabagi) with assorted dips and the the karisik kebab platter. We enjoyed the babaganoush and saksuka thoroughly. The lamb chops and chicken kebab were moist and perfectly cooked. For dessert, we tried their baklava and kreme karamel. The baklava was excellent! It was rolled like a spring roll and each bite gave one the full flavor of the baklava.The size of the place is more like a bistro than a restaurant with both outside seating and inside which is temperature controlled. We sat inside and were very comfortable. I think they had six tables that accommodate 4 pax each and two tables that accommodate 6 pax each inside the temp-controlled seating. They serve beer and wine in addition to the non-alcoholic drink offerings.Would I go back to Alaturka? You bet! I cannot wait to taste the other dishes on their menu
5
I am staying at a hotel near by so I came to Arab street for a lookaround. This whole area is so interesting. My taxi driver from the airport told me this is the place to come at night. I walked by and the very friendly host in front pull me in. I was hungry so why not? The beer was icy cold,a good start. I was a solo diner and sat right next to the street, great to watch the scene. All the food I had here was first class the lamb was outstanding. The thing about when you are on the road is to come to a place and have a different slice of life and taste then you would back home. This is the place to come
2
I've been here more than a dozen times since living in Singapore and last night I was very disappointed. The new menu does look fabulous but the service and food quality leaves a lot to be desired.We ordered 3 dishes - the mezze was great, falafel was average and poor presentation, the salad with the Kofte was old (leaves were brown). We told the staff that serving salad that was clearly cut the day before and browning (especially on a peak trade night of Friday) was not acceptable. We then ordered 3 further dishes for friends who joined 30 mins later and they got one dish wrong and never brought the other two. The staff were more interested in standing on the street smoking then doing a simple job with only a 1/3rd full restaurant. After this experience my Husband said he wouldn't come again and I'm inclined to agree - what a shame to go from one of the best to the worst
3
With good reasons, Alaturka is known for fantastic food and our visit confirmed it. All dishes we ordered were to our liking. The (non-monetary) price you pay is the “uncoordinated” or rather call it incompetent service. The waiters and waitresses are simply overwhelmed with the amount of tables to serve. You wait ages till you are finally served. Our wine was forgotten and by the time we got it we had our main dish already. For the bill we had to wait again 15 minutes. It is a pity that the great work of the chef in the kitchen is being executed by poorly trained personnel in the serving are
4
Our experience, with a group of seven, was a very good one. Helpful, friendly and attentive staff - attentive to the need/wants of children, teenagers, and adults, and this was on a bust Friday evening too. The food was very good - freshly prepared and tasty. Freshly cooked bread. Tasty pide. A delicious shared meat platter. A very good restaurant next to the busiest crossroads in Kampong Glam
3
I went with my family after a friend recommended this place. At the moment we arrived the manager was rude, like not wanting us there. The restaurant was empty and he asked if we had a reservation. A more nicer guy came and gave us a table. The food was ok, not superb. Probably was the whole negative experience that ruin the flavor of the food. After we left and walked around Arab Street we notice that the people on the other restaurants were more welcoming. So for a family dinner experience, better walk around Arab Street area and find a more relax and fun place to eat
5
Now I understand why it is always busy, it has many patrons. Food is very good - a must try is the Chef's recommended meat platter. My friends love the lamb - it was tender and tasty. We love the bread (cannot remember the name though) that has cheese and spinach inside. The hummus and dips platter was equally great as well - it was served with this big balloon bread - which was also good. The service is very good and associates are attentive and precise in letting us know how many minutes our food would be served
5
This restaurant is situated in Kampong Glam in Bussorah Street. We met friends here for lunch at midday and got a seat outside, luckily it was a bit on the "early" side as the restaurant filled up fairly quickly inside and out. The homemade lemonade was refreshing and not so sweet as most drinks are in Singapore. The meals were delicious, we had kofte, kebabs, a mutton and eggplant dish and an Ekmek which is a Turkish bread. The couple with us shared a kebab platter with mixed kebabs and salads. Dessert was Turkish baklava and firin sutlac (a nice creamy rice pudding) which were thoroughly enjoyed. It was a lovely location with excellent service and excellent food. Highly recommended
4
There's a lot of restaurants In the vicinity but Alaturka Is one of the few to serve Ice cold beer. The food here Is really good. The large vegetarian platter Is great for 2 people and almost a complete dinner In Itself. Falafels are very tasty, as are the kebabs. Service was friendly and efficient. Would definitely return
5
My husband and I came here for dinner on our last evening in Singapore. We sat outside as it was quite packed inside. Firstly the restaurant is located in Arab town and from Alaturka you can see the main mosque at night (masjid Sultan). It looked absolutely beautiful and peaceful all lit up.The service at Alaturka was very good, we ordered the platter for 2 and honestly it was the right amount of food, it was delicious! Cost wise it was very reasonably priced. I would recommend if you're interested in authentic Turkish food and fancy kebabs, chicken shish etc
4
A lot of the Arab Street Restaurants don't serve alcohol so if you enjoy a beer with your food you need to search a little harder. Nice Fresh bread with a meat platter, the Lamb Chops and the Lamb Shish were the best!Will definitely go back to explore more of the menu there was to many interesting items for one visi
3
This place largely thrives from the setting and atmosphere, especially at night when seated outdoors. It has the chill mediterranean flair. Food is decent, nothing special but not bad at all. Too bad the wait staff, whilst they are certainly trying, they are easily confused, can't remember orders (which dish is for whom, even when visiting with only 2 people), the food of one person arrives way later than for the other guest meaning one guest is eating the other is still waiting, and we had to remind the staff we were still waiting for drinks (Drinks should have arrived way before our food arrived)
4
I have been here several times over the years for the lunchtime Mezze and homemade lemonade. Nothing has changed. It is still as good, with their wonderful bread and a mixture of dips. Price is reasonable. Good tables in Street, so you can watch the passing trade and tourists
2
Food was okay, but not more than that. Prices however in this restaurant are way too high in relation to the quality and the size of the food being served.
Service varies strongly between very nice and friendly and not saying a single word.
5
Superb end to the year. Great place to come and sit in the open air and have a meal and soak up the atmosphere and lively vibe. It's all about the vibe and soul here. This place is in the adjacent road to the Arab street or on it but they are all the same. No idea what I ate but loved what I ate. Music, instruments, open air and lotta soul. It's all happening. No better way to bring in 2017 than here. THIS PLACE AND THE LOCALITY Had to be in the TO DO LIST FOR AINGAPORE
4
Recommended by the Michelin Guide you take your seat believing this will be a good place to dine within the famous Kampong Glam. I enjoyed the Meze Tabagi, the lamb and what looks like 'balloon bread'. We sat outside and received attentive service and when combined with great friends and good wine it makes for an excellent night
5
My family of five went to try the Turkish food and some coffee - which was in a beautiful cup about the size of a thimble with coffee that tasted strangely both like dirt and something wonderful - and we were not disappointed. If you suspect that you would like Turkish food and are trying to figure out online where to eat Turkish food in Singapore, or you are wondering what to do while on Arab Street as there are a ton of Lebanese and Turkish restaurants to choose from, I recommend you go here. The food was excellent! We had the huge meat platter that gives you samples of just about everything and I would order it again. Each meat was delicious and cooked well (as opposed to well cooked) - tender and tasty. We sat outside and really had a great time. The people don't bully you to eat their food, like the crazy guys across the street on the corner, they just take care of you when you come. Will go again when back in Singapore
4
I've been here twice.Ordered different mains each time and I love all the orders.Appetizer I ordered the platter, love it as I get to taste all the different appetizers.Main dishes were not disappointing at all.Dessert which is sweet vermicelli is delicious and not overly sweet 
4
The only Turkish restaurant on the Singapore Michelin Bib Gourmand list.The food is great. We ordered the Meze Tabaki which is a platter of appetizer dips that goes with the bread. We ordered the soft and fresh from the oven Lavas bread to go with it. The kebab is tasty, tender and juicy. We ordered the Karisik Kebab which is a platter of assortment of beef, mutton & chicken. Tavuk Sis is a chicken kebab dish that comes with rice and vegetable salad, and the chicken is nice. Lahmacun is a Turkish pizza that uses Turkish spices. Kunefe is the dessert that we loved.We simply loved the food. We also feasted our eyes to the beautiful decor with Turkish carpets and porcelain wares on the walls.Be prepared to wait 45min to 90 min though. Due to the popularity of the restaurant, there is usually a crowd, and the staff may be overwhelmed and not able to give customers the full attention. eg the staff did not serve us the appetizer 1st. Instead we were served all the other dishes. After finishing the other dishes, we were still waiting for the appetizer. Then we highlighted it to the staff, & they were very polite and apologetic, explaining that there was a mix-up in the orders. They prepared the appetizer immediately. So that was further 15 to 20 min wait for us. After the appetizer was served, the staff served us the same dishes that we had already consumed, presumably thinking that the appetizer was our 1st course. We explained that we have already consumed all the other dishes, and thankfully, the dishes that we ordered were so popular that other tables also ordered the same thing, so the duplicated dishes could be given to them without waste.Overall, it is a pleasant experience, and the staff are polite and friendly
4
Had a celebratory lunch here. First time at the recommendation of my son. Had a good assortment of the food. I recommend you try the Meze Tabagi ( starter) and the Karisik Kebab ( shared dish) and wash it down with a Aryan or for the less adventurous, the apple tea. Excellent ambience, service and food. 4 thumbs up from me
5
My husband and I ate here twice, once with my son, and several days later on our own. Dorothy the hostess not only remembered we had been here ("Will Ian be joining you?"), but she remembered what we'd eaten. Our favorite dish was the Beyti Kabob, lamb wrapped in Turkish flat bread with a sauce to die for. The Meza Tabagi (appetizer plate) had a wonderful variety, and the eggplant in the Hunkar Bejendi was particularly good. The restaurant is two blocks from the Sultan Mosque
2
Despite the high rating / reviews this was the most disappointing food I had....a mezzeh platter for a single person is a few spoonfuls of everything slammed on to a small plate (S$20+) which looked abosolutely un-appetising Having had the same in several countries this was totalled down sadl
3
We're happy to be given a table even when the restaurant is fully booked. While there are many restaurants there only few are well occupied, like Alaturk. Service was friendly, and even, when we were given an hour for our dinner due to a later booking, they didn't rush us. Food was OK and the bread freshly baked, which was the highlight
5
I always return to this place when traveling to Singapore, it's near Sultan Mosque, with great food, friendly service which virtually transports you to Istambul.
It's a nice place with good quality of food.
4
First time trying Turkish Food, the ambience was awesome & very helpful staff.
The portion of the food is big enough.
4
First time eating here. Nice street-side outdoor seating option. Staff were attentive and polite. In particular, the front of house manager, Dorothy, was great - very approachable, very friendly, and very helpful.The food that we ordered arrived quickly and was delicious. Of particular note, in terms of the flavour, quality, and presentation were the Beyti Lamb and the Kuzu Pirzola. Both dishes were excellent
3
I went with my husband in public holiday night, which wasn't busy. The food wasn't fantastic but good enough. The staff smoked outside even we were sitting outside and no staff gave us attention when we need to ask something. At the end, they charged 10% service fee?! Humm
4
This was my second visit, and what I like about this place (compared to neighboring options) is that they offer a meat platter to share, which is more than enough for two people.Sadly, they aren't very flexible with adjusting the menu - i.e., no rice, extra veges, or substituting meats for ones preferred. This was unfortunate, as there are many other options around.
3
came to know about the restaurant only after they were named by Michelin Bib. Went for a friday night dinner with A. The place is difficult to locate but was quite crowded that time. We had mezze as starter and went for the lamb kebab - both were average and completely undistinguishable from the other shops in that area like Blue Jazz or Navin. We had kunafa as desert and I admit it may be an issue with our Indian taste buds (though I have been exposed to Turkish cuisines since ages) something was missing - it was not sweet at all and tasted like leather. On the positive the old lady was very attentive to make sure we had a pleasant dinne
1
Great location and given the positive reviews we had high expectations. However, the really slow and poor service was a huge let down. Food didn't arrive on time. They forgot one dish - and when reminded the server told us that it would take 15 minutes more - no service recovery from the folks. With the extremely frustrating service delivery and average food quality, the pricing is just too high. Unless the owners pay attention to the detail, this is one restaurant that will not deliver to it's promise
4
Went for a Turkish dinner with some friends. Start off with a cold shared dish. It is a well-spread varieties. Then came the main dish! Love the chicken n lamb. Very well marinated n tasty. The beef "hotdog" not my favorite due to the spices it used. Nonetheless very good experience accompanied with a Portuguese red wine and a very attentive staff from malaysia, studied in the USA. Must try!
5
I've tried pretty much every single Turkish and Lebanese restaurant in the Arab Street area, and i can say without a doubt that Alaturka is by far the best one. An amazing Mezzee platter, fantastic lavash bread, delicious falafel and exquisite lamb, makes this a must-visit restaurant for both meat eaters and vegetarians. And the prices are very reasonable. I was not surprised to learn that Alaturka was awarded a "Bib Gourmand" from Michelin, signifying great value for money. Service is friendly and efficient. I'll be back
2
Alaturka used to be considered good and authentic but it has seriously gone down hill in quality. The ingredients tasted like they were frozen vegetables and the meat was cooked poorly.The mezze were hit and miss. The ones we liked, we ate because they were there. The rest we discarded.The only saving grace is the lavas bread.....which came 15 min before all the mezze and dips.
2
Have tried several authentic places in Turkey and outside and I must say that the food did not meet our expectations of 'turkish' food. Pretty pricey too!
4
Had a great lunch here . Great service , fresh well cooked and great tasting food. Best in the street I believe. Will be back.
3
First off, the owner is lovely - we were almost the only ones there and she was very nice, helpful and talkative. Food was decent and priced well for the meal we got. Good lemonade and hummus.
4
Small restaurant located near sultan mosque. Slightly pricey, but overall good food, service and ambience.
5
Nice Turkish and Mediterranean food!! There are different dishes to share. Prices around 20 - 25 Singapore dollars per meal.
4
Group of 6 of us sat outside and the food although was delicious and "NOT" quite authentic was delicious however the service was terribly slow. our dishes came one after another in between a period of about 15 mins. so u cant wait for everybody's food to come to the table in order to enjoy your meal together. Service is typical to that anywhere in Singapore, which is NO SERVICE AT ALL.
4
amazing kebabs, hummus platter was average ...but the star of the day was the dessert 'kunefe' ...a rich and heavy dessert ..not meant for the diet freaks .... the service was good but the interesting and different part was sitting under the yellow light of the streets ....under the open sky :) .... a different feel from the regular outing'
2
We went twice. The first time we were the only people there (literally) at 3PM for a late light lunch. Ordered one a cold appetizer to share and it took a while, which was weird, but it was amazing. So we went again for dinner 4 days later. For dinner we were seated and asked for our order straight away - awesome. They were busy BUT since the place has less than 30 small tables and 5+ waiters/waitresses, they SHOULD be able to handle it. Nope. Its a mess. I don't think they separate the tables into sections for the wait staff... it's more of a free for all. After ordering straight away I had to ask for water 20 minutes later. One waitress asked what we were waiting for, went to check, then continued waiting on other people without updating us. A second waiter came to CLEAR OUR PLATES that hadn't been used - then he went to check on our order and never came back with an update. All in all we were there for 40 minutes then left. I want 45 minutes of my life back. Ridiculous. It was a table for two - not a lot to remember. Ridiculous
2
I came to Alaturka for lunch, and I am sad to say I was disappointed. It was not so much due to the fault of the overly-high prices, but the food (or the lack of it). For starters, if you have any vegetarian friends or you are vegetarian yourself, you can skip this place without a heavy conscience. There are not many vegetarian options here at all, so do not bother. The rice at Alaturka is priced at SGD 3.50 per serving. The serving size is not really that big, which makes the price quite unreasonable. However, the taste of the rice was amazing. I do not think I have had rice quite like that before in Singapore. It was soft, moist, and just delicious. The cold Turkish apple tea we ordered was around the same price as the rice, and was one full glass, which was reasonable. It was quite decent, but that`s it really. After all these negative points, comes one shining light of perfection- the décor. The entire restaurant was done up in Turkish lamps,cloth,and decorative plates on the walls. The tablecloth for all tables was a fancy-looking mini rug under glass. All in all, fabulous décor. In conclusion, food was expensive, below average, and did not have any good choices for anyone who happened to be vegetarian. However, the décor is something that was done well, and done right

We have eaten here with a groups of 2 through to 9 and the restaurant easily catered for us each time. We find we enjoy it more with a larger group so we can order the platters to share. The food is very good with the hommous and mixed meat platters our favourites. The atmosphere of the Arab St area is great on a Saturday night with the streets being pedestrian only and lots of people out
4
First time having Arabian food and it was a pleasant meal experience. I never liked spinach but the spinach pizza is awesome!
5
My husband and I often visit Alaturka on a causal Friday night. The food is great and we enjoy sitting outside to see the busy street life.
4
Good place to eat Turkish cuisine at around Arab street area. Try out the mixed Kebab platter (Kerisik Kebab) and Lamb Mussaka. Also highly recommended is the Kunefe - great dessert to finish off the main course.

We went here one evening as a party of 4, although the place was busy and we had to wait 30 mins the waiter advised and kept us fully informed. Once seated our orders were taken promptly and the food arrived at a decent pace. All the lamb dishes were lovely, we ordered a fish kebab dish which was a little in the dry side but overall a pleasant experience, best part of the meal was the cheese based dessert

We have been to this restaurant a number of times over recent years. Our last visit we were served up the most awful portion of baklava which surprised me as they used be a really good restaurant, however we were in the vicinity recently and tried again to see how it was post renovation.Unfortunately it was very very poor.We came across a number of mens hairs in our starter which we had to sent back.My main course came out first, then after 5 minutes the waiter brought over an incorrect main course for my wife, when we advised what we ordered it was at least 25-30 minutes and several requests later when the meal finally arrived, despite the mess up and delay there was very little apology. Of course when we asked for the bill they were very prompt with this, I was very surprised that though 2 of the 4 dishes we ordered were disastrous we received no discount.I used enjoy bringing guests to Singapore here but will not return

Alaturka has moved next door to its original restaurant. The restaurant feels very fresh and the decorations create a pleasant ambiance. The food however was disappointing. I have been there many times over the decade and this trip we were taking two new friends. The food seemed very bland, carelessly cooked and not up to the standard I associate with Alaturka. We paid and our bill and headed to another restaurant for coffee and dessert.
3
This used to be the best turkish restaurant in singapore. They closed for awhile and reopened after a renovation.I come here couple times a year.I prefer the previous look and feel, and moreover the food quality and quantity suffered and is steadily deterirorating. Especially the signature kebabs to share for two. Too bad as arab street is a nice atmospheric neighborhood, and am now looking for an alternative go to turkish place.
4
Went there in 5th Jan with my partner and for appetizers, we had falafel with a delicious garlic yoghurt dip. We shared a traditional lamb kebab and the taste was well-balanced as the spices was not too overpowering. We also had a moussaka to share. It was a delightful experience
3
Alaturka is located in Bussorah street, which is perpendicular to Arab Street at the far end. This is a very small joint with a narrow backyard alley which leads up to a restroom. This was not a planned visit as our original choice had already closed. Despite the late hour, we were welcomed inside. The Baba Ghanoush, made of mashed brinjal ,onions, tomatoes, olive oil , and seasonings was quite good. The bread and hummus were good too, but not extraordinary. The kebabs were succulent. Service was good. Beer is available
2
Are used TripAdvisor to try to find the best Middle Eastern food in this area. With the ratings that I saw I thought that this would be a good choice. The portions were small for a $27 appetizer plate. I noticed that the domas were missing, and only after that did they offer to replace it with something else. Then she also charged for the accompanying bread that she suggested to go along with the replacement. I was not happy with that. The main dishes were average but fresh and I don't really have any problem here. What I did not like was the absence of something that I paid for that was only offered to be substituted once I noted it. I definitely will not visit this place agai
4
Got this one recommended and it is worth a visit. It is located in a great, lively but also relaxing street...and the food is really good! Give the Hummus, Borek and Falafel a try...it's great!!! I would com again when being again in Singapore...
4
The best Arab/turkish food in the city.
The lamb chops are very good but the portion is small.
Worth getting the lava bread, babaganoush and hummus.
The falafel is also very well prepared.
4
Decent food cold beer. Friendly staff. Cool location. Falafel was excellent. Lamb wraps were kinda bla. Not much meat & filled up with mostly lettuce.
5
Friendly little restaurant offering Turkish specialities. The food is fantastic, I went twice in 3 nights and would not hesitate to return. The Imam Bayildi is delicious. Portion sizes are very healthy and the staff couldn't be more helpful.
5
This is by far the best Turkish restaurant in Singapore! My Wife, Son and myself have been dining at this restaurant for years now. We have tried other Turkish restaurants on Arab St, some still around, some shut down and find Ala Turka does not shortchanged on ingredients, quality and presentation. I've been a loyal customer. Only sad part is that the original restaurant has been hoarded up for renovation and they moved next door which doesn't have a feel that you are in Turkey! I hope they retain the original restaurant which has nice Turkish mosaic, lightings, and other ornaments which reminds one of Turkey. Nevertheless, I would still go back each time I crave for Turkish!
5
If you are looking for good Turkish food, don't miss eating here.We have been in Singapore for 4 years but just found out about this restaurant through a review.This is by far the the best on Arab St. The interior is nicely done and the food is quite good. We had Borek, La Machun, Sis Tawuk, Adana and Lamb Chops. Their popped bread with sesame seeds is real nice and so are the rice served as side with kebabs.What tops in my view is their service. Right from the time you get seated until you will leave, you will have a feeling of being taken care off.I will definitely visit Alaturka again!
4
Walked up and down looking at all the restaurants. Finally settled on this one and was not disappointed. It was a very hot night so we opted to eat inside with the airconditioning. The service we received was good, food delicious and the mint tea was just what I needed. I definitely recommend this restaurant
5
Place was extremely crowded but thankfully we made reservation and we still had to wait for 10 min. Wait was all worth the effort. It's a very small place with a big heart and more importantly best food and value for money. The Crown jewel was of course the baklava......
3
Let me start by saying our food tasted good. I'm not sure it was authentic Turkish food, but it tasted good. The service however was a different story. We waited so long for our order to be taken that we considered leaving but decided to "find" our waitresses. She was at the back of the half empty restaurant. She was not particularly happy to take our order and had a sullen attitude. Not anxious to return, but if you crave Turkish food this could be an option
4
I visited alaturka with my colleagues on the eve of the public holiday so this tiny place was crowded nonetheless the food was good. Portions vary however. Staff was attentive. Main course averages at 20$ish and beers at 10$. Currently they're having a renovation so the place might be hard to locate. Overall good experience. I will visit again.
3
Visited this place for lunch, I think I had expected more due to previous reviews, food was not bad, it took long time to serve food, Turkish pizza is recommended
5
Had a delicious lunch here while visiting the Kampong Glam area. The dishes we ordered were all tasty, especially the plate with the different dips etc. Very friendly owner.
4
The place was really crowded. We managed to get seated outside. The ambiance is great. Staff was friendly. Personally I didn't like the food much. May be because I was expecting more. No shisha available
4
The best turkish food in Singapore. We enjoyed the food served at Alaturka. we will return for another great dinner or lunch.
4
Three of us shared some starters, a dip plate and a shared meat platter. It was a very enjoyable lunch of delicious food. Would recommend if you are in the Arab Quarter.
5
Excellent place to have Turkish/Mediterranean food. Placed in the Arab streets near Bugis. Try out their kababs and the breads. Highly recommended.
4
Ate here as a family group of 4 plus a 2 year old granddaughter. We all had an enjoyable meal of a variety of mezze, kebabs moussaka and a lamb and beef and lamb beyti plus baklava and drinks. The food was all prepared to a high standard and delicious, the ambience was friendly and welcoming. A thoroughly enjoyable meal and very good value
3
One of many Turkish restaurants on Bussorah Street, can't say I was overly impressed. The mezze plate was ordinary, the bread dried out and the fried vegetable platter nothing to write home about. The prices were a little high for the quality of the food, unless you're absolutely dying for a taste of Turkish food, I'd stick with the many Indian or Asian restaurants in the neighbourhood, better value for money
5
One of the few Turkish restaurants in town, this one is a winner for its location in a shophouse of the quaint Kampong Glam area and its truly Turkish decor. Enjoying their tasty Turkish cuisine in a cosy corner indoors will have one think that one of their magic carpets has taken you to Turkey
3
I am half Turkish and grew up eating all kind of Turkish food. Since South East Asia does not have too many Turkish restaurants I decided to give it a try in Singapore. However I cannot agree with most of the positive reviews on here about this restaurant. It could be one of the best for Turkish food in Singapore (I have only tried 2) but in my opinion, in terms of quality, authenticity and taste it really was not special at all, if not pretty disappointing. The Iskender Kebab was completely wrong, it's sauce was more like a watery chili sauce than the usual tomato sauce (not sure how the restaurant could get this simple part wrong) and the sliced doner meat inside tasted like beef flavored Styrofoam.... The mezze selection was alright, but nothing special, and the baklava did not remotely taste like real baklava... the only thing that was pretty good was the chicken kebab. The service was friendly overall but much too overwhelmed with all the guests who could hardly fit in the restaurant. So if you really want to try this place you'd be better off getting a reservation, it is definitely one of the most popular Turkish restaurants in the area...but honestly I have no idea why
4
Alaturka is my go - to restaurant whenever I crave Turkish food. Been patronizing since 2005. My faves are the freshly baked breads, falafel and kebab. The flavours are slightly mellowed to suit local palete, but still enjoyable. The ambience is great.
3
Over the last 3 years unfortunately the taste of the food at Alaturka has become less and less Turkish. The quality is not bad, but if one expects Turkish food one will be disappointed.
5
I went Today for lunch with my family, ( 1 kid 1 baby and hubby) and we had a great time. Food was delicious and staff was friendly. Small restaurant and Nice ambiance, we will definitely com back
4
It is pleasure to sample the tasty dishes they have on offer. The freshness of the dips and salads are s great way to start. Make sure lamb dish is part of your order, it really is tasty.
4
A friend who lives in Singapore took us here for lunch. Local knowledge is priceless! What a treat! Excellent food, service and a small family restaurant that deserves a visit!

This was a very good Turkish restaurant for lunch. The food tasted like it was authentic and better than other places I've tried. The dining area was comfortable and the staff were friendly. Many options in the area, and this proved to be a good choice
4
A small restaurant near Masjid Sultan amid a row of seemingly kitschy and touristy restaurants, it has great breads and all the usual dips and meats that you would expect from a good Turkish restaurant. I think the owner is actually Iranian but the service is attentive, the meats are delicious and a good time can be had by all
4
This place serves one of the best and freshest hummus' with handmade Turkish flatbread. The flatbread comes hot and fresh. We've ordered two servings and ate them like cavemen and women; dipping and wiping hummus off our plates with the bread. We've also ordered the sharing platter of meat (S$33) and it has always been cooked to satisfaction. It is served on a heated stove. Comes with rice in the middle of the dish. We've been here twice and it has been a good experience on both counts. Average cost per person is about S$30+
4
Service was a bit quick, but other than that we really enjoyed Alaturka... nice to have something different in Singapore for a change...The hummus, halloumi cheese and lavas bread were all good and the barbecued fish in garlic/lemon sauce was delicious...We'll definitely be coming back here again :-
2
We ordered Falafels, they were over fried and under seasoned, very bland and lacking flavor. The kebabs were also lacking flavor, they were served with "brown sauce". I don't think there is anything Turkish about brown sauce. Moussaka was also cooked in brown sauce and the only tomatoes to be found were 2 small slices resting on top as a garnish. We hoped for a nice dessert to end our meal, unsurprisingly is was as disappointing as the previous courses. If you want a Turkish meal experience, don't eat at Alaturk
4
Alaturka occupies two attractive shophouses and offers sidewalk tables on charming Bussorah Street. Reserve early for a table in the bar side if you want drinks with dinner. It was already booked the night we were there, but we were very happy with the food and service on the dry side
4
I have been going to Alaturka for many years and I have never been disappointed with their food. It may not be 100% authentic but it will be as close as you can get in this part of the world. Try their cold mezze platter, the patlican kebab, imam bayildi and the iskender kebab. And you have to try their lavash bread, which is fresh and absolutely delicious. The service is efficient and the prices very reasonable
3
Been to this place several times and every time I go to Alaturka, I decide not to visit the place again due to their extremely poor service. Multiple experiences on mess-ups with the orders, delay in getting food, request for a few customization to the dish (veg etc) passes through the ears without being recorded anywhere. I can really go on about the experience's I have had here - nonetheless, the fact that this place keeps drawing me to it is the wonderful food. Truly authentic and genuine, one can't have qualms on any dish ordered at the place. Get here for one of the best kebabs in Singapore. Alas, I wish they do take an effort to train staff - help guests have a wholesome experience
5
This is my second time to dine in Alaturka. I only get to know the place as I was searching on what to try near our hotel. As soon as I know they serve Kanafeh, humus and baklava, I told my husband that I will look for this place no matter what. The walk we had to find the shop is interesting. Many shops surrounds the area plus the mosque near the place and a visit to kampong glam makes it worthwhile. It is a very small place they have yet clean and warm vibrant feel of a Mediterranean ambiance. The Manu list was kept simple and few, yet everything is worth trying. The humus is plenty, meant for sharing with an additional order of bread. Each plate was meant for sharing if appetite is a bit small. Food were cooked to perfection, everything is worth waiting for. I even took home Kanafeh and baklava back in Manila to share with my dad who wasn't able to join us on our vacation. My experience of Alaturka food made me travel back in UAE were me and my husband used to work. Second time was just this November when I invited a college friend who used to work in Dubai and now works in Singapore, to try Alaturka as well. The food served never changed. They kept the freshness, proportion, quality and taste. Humus was so divine. Proportion is quite big (we forgot to order extra bread to finish the remaining half). My husband ordered ground lamb (pardon I forgot the name..all I can remember is that it looks like grilled sausages) with rice and some veggies, my friend ordered a stew with a bedding of creamy eggplant which was very rich in flavor, aroma and portion. A must try! I ordered salmon on the other hand which was cooked perfectly, moist and flavorful. We finished it off with Kanafeh. Although there is no cheese on it, but they are the only place I know which serves it, good for those who are Kanafeh addict like me. I couldn't compose my words well to tell how great the food was and how simple yet vibrant their shop is, you should try Alaturka when visiting Singapore. The adjacent streets are full of interesting places to visit as well

What an amazing place. There are 2 sides - one which serves alcohol and one for no alcohol so check which side you want. The menu was really extensive. The staff couldn't have been more helpful and accommodating. The food was really good and the prices weren't too bad. A fun evening
5
We were blown away by the experience we had here. We went at lunchtime during the week as we were on holiday in Singapore and met a lovely staff member (I think his was Yusuf but I could be wrong). Not only did he take our order but he spent time with us and explained some of the history of SIngapore, he told us about his family and all in all it was a lovely and very refreshing experience.Beyond this, the food was great and the portions were huge. We ordered a platter between us and could barely finish it all. The restaurant itself has lovely decor and I can only say positive things
3
Not really worthy of four stars but three and a half would be fair.Three of us ate here on Saturday evening, fortunately having booked although we weren't aware of the alcohol related dividing line between the al fresco tables but the soft drinks were fine.The owners appear to have taken notice of comments concerning the service, the waiters were very attentive and helpful and nothing was too much trouble.We started with two Hallumi cheese and a Kizartma followed by Kuzu Pirzola, Tavuk Sis, Adana lamb and Haydari which were good and tasty. The total bill came to $105.05 Singaporean.I imagine that with a little more focus on the food they could easily take this restaurant to the next level but nonetheless we enjoyed ourselves
4
If you want alcohol with your meal, ask to be seated in the section that serves alcohol. Those would be the non-tiled tables, next door. Not exactly sure how that works, but it does. After a delay in getting our beers, we ordered a couple of appetizers. Didn't realize how big the portions were, so for 2 people, one would have been plenty. Had half of each leftover. The hummus and ezeme were delicious. And definitely order the lavas. So good. After seeing trays of Karisike Kebab passing us by, we decided to try it. We were not disappointed. My husband said the lamb chops were some of the best he'd had. Said they were fresh and so tender. The vegetables were cooked just right. Will definitely be going back
3
I selected the restaurant because of tripadvisor ratings and was disappointed. The service is bad and extremely slow. The staff was overwhelmed with the amount of tables they had to serve. We got twice food at our table that we had not ordered. The food we had was not really what I expected and at best a local interpretation of Turkish or Middle Eastern cuisine. The Turkish salad was small and tastless. The Halumi cheese was ok. Our main grill platter was covered with too much sauce. We had to ask for the bill 3 times. Needless to say we will not come back
2
Used to be one of my favorite Turkish restaurant in Singapore but since couple of years the service and the food has deteriorated . Went their recently yet again hoping that things must hv improved but was disappointed yet again.the service throughout was very average and at times was terrible.our two main course came at two different time, so while I was eating mine my wife was staring at her empty plate and vice versa.the food taste has disappeared with almost no seasoning in most of the items which we ordered . In search of a new Turkish restaurant 
3
Had a very ordinary meal here. The hummus was bland. The kebabs did not seem to be craved off the spit. The shared kebab main course was reasonably tasty, especially the chicken. Would not return for the food.
5
I've been here for lunch a few times. Each time it's been good. The insides are very nicely decorated. The staff was very kind and accommodating of our 2yr old and stroller.Today we had the King Kabab, some kind of wrapped beef/mutton dish and bread. It was all very good and the 2 dishes were enough to split between 3 adults. We all were full after the meal.Have eaten there before, will eat there again.It's a bit pricey for lunch though
5
Visiting Alaturka is a tradition for us whenever we are in Singapore. My parents found it while wandering near Arab Street, and now we make a point to come back when we can. It's a small place on Bussorah Street - there's not much seating inside and not that much outside, although we always eat inside to take advantage of the cooler air. The inside is pretty with the brick and the plate/lamp decorations - I particularly love that deep color of blue. We've never had amazing service (perfectly fine, however!) but we come for the food!I'm never as hungry as I think I am, so we always order too much - hummus, bread, cacik/haydari, iskender kebab, and tea. This is more than enough to share, and they're good about bringing more bread if you need it. My husband's ordered other things but I always stick to my favorites. It is all delicious - my husband thinks its the best Turkish food he's ever had, although to be fair he's never been to Turkey. I have been to Turkey and can say this food is amazing. The Turkish food we have in New York just doesn't compare to Alaturka. Highly recommended
1
Went to alaturka today and was shocked to see a huge rat. we brought it to the attention of the waiters and were rudely told to keep our voices down and shunted out to a table outside. Yes we were agitated but there was no apology whatsoever and shockingly rude staff. Needless to say we left immediately. And they didn't seem to care
5
Just had dinner here after being forced to leave another place just up the road because of bad service. And was pleasantly surprised here to find the waiter friendly,smiley and prompt. He recommended a dessert called Kunefe,which was surprising. Highly recommend this place for its food and service:
4
This place it not much on decor but the food is great. The fresh naan bread is "a must try". There were a few good wines to choose from. I had the chicken and lamb shish kebabs. They were well cooked and not too spicy. Desserts are enough to share
4
Food: All appetizers are veg! Falafel was decent. The dish 'Imam Bayildi' has an interesting story (it means the priest fainted after savoring the awesomeness of the dish!). Well, I did not. And even you won't. Its eggplant with loads of onion and sauce stuffing served in light sauce.Cost: Falafel + Imam Bayildi + Iced tea cost around SGD 33Location: One of the coolest places in Spore, Arab street / Haji road, for Food + Hookah + good crowd
3
The restaurant has recently expanded its floor area. However, the Turkish theming is absent to this new space. You will be greeting with modern tables and chairs...nothing Turkish or Mediterranean to its restaurant decor. Food is just average. A little pricey but food portion is generous. Share your mains if you ain't that hungry
3
I don't know how this restaurant has received so many good reviews. We have visited twice (thinking perhaps they deserved a second chance), and both times it was nothing to rave about. Heavy and dense falafels, tasteless and bland hummus. A dressed salad that has been sitting around too long. The doner kebab was definitely not shaved from a spit. Just some cooked chicken chopped into small pieces covered in a 'brown sauce'. When we asked what the sauce was, we were told it was a mixture of ketchup and chilli sauce (!!). Service is good, but not worth returning.
4
I went to this place based on TripAdvisor reviews and it was a great decision. I and my wife visit the joint often. The Meze Tabagi (Salad platter) is as authentic as in the middle east. The lavash bread just adds to the taste and it is an experience to cherish. I also recommend the hot apple tea, sheesh-tavuk, falafel and Ayran (like salted buttermilk).The ambience is very good too and it really feels like one in an Arab country. Having lived in the middle east I can vouch that the food is as authentic as can be. The owner is sweet and accommodating even when its full and we have no reservations. I do not eat beef and avoid lamb. So I stick to only chicken based dishes especially where the meat is not minced. The Ispanakli pide should be tried and falafel's are at their best. Prices are slightly high but reasonable.Overall very good value for money.....and remember if you are in Singapore.....try this at least once. You will not regret it
5
This is one of the favourite restaurants which I and my wife visit very often. The food is very tasty and healthy. Very authentic too!!
4
Dined here with my wife and sister-in-law just a day ago. Nestled along the busy road of bussorah street, this restaurant oozes out middle eastern feel with its ambience. There were lots of Arabic artifacts hung on the wall and Arabic songs blaring in the background. The menu was presented to us and ice water was served to us promptly. We ordered thr traditional Arabic mezze for starters and waitress helped us with the selection of main courses according to our preference.  We ordered a chicken kebab dish which came out with buttered rice and vegetables, a chicken wrap dish and a musaka, which had fried slices of egg plant, potatoes and shredded chicken with melted cheese on top. The arabic mezze was nice. The dips tasted fresh and subtly spiced. The main dishes were good too. The servings were huge.Overall, it's a decent Turkish restaurant that serves variety of turkish dishes at a reasonable price
4
I loved the food. The mezze platter with lavas bread is a must! Imam bayildi Aubergine dish is fab! Turkish tea, mint tea, falafel. Chicken sote was good. Beat Turkish food I have in Singapore! Staff is helpful. Ambience is decent. Wish it was a bigger place though. Booze isn't allowed inside but next door one can have alcohol.
1
I visited this restaurant with a colleague Sunday lunch time. We waited 25 minutes for a Meza (cold platter that takes 5 minutes to be prepared). Once served I noticed that there was no vine leaves as shown in the menu. They said that they run out then, however the waiter managed to find 1 somehow somewhere and brought it to me. it didn't come without lemon as it should have been. When I tasted the food I could tell it was not fresh. Dried vegetables, and all the 5 portions of hummous etc were a bit off. The tabuleh with chilly was absolutely off. The attitude of the staff was generally "don't ask me again im not bothered". I simply gave up and didn't want to complain. This restaurant does not deserve business. By the way I noticed two other tables complaining about their food too while we were there. Certainly non typical Arabian food, bad food, dirty uniform staff and expensive. They also charge you 10% service charge which is written in small characters on the last page of the menu
5
We adore Turkish food, and search for it everywhere we go. Alaturka filled the bill for us. We ordered lamb and chicken adana kebabs, cacik, their lovely breads, and salads, and found it all perfect. We highly recommend Alaturka, and wish it were just a little closer to our home
5
This is my 3rd visit to Alaturka after visiting with friends. The food is always consitent and fresh! Service is great and very attentive! Coban Salata is good, hummus, mussaka and filo feta rolls! Many other delicious things on the menu too! Ive tried many other turkish restaurants in the area (the ones on the main street by the mosque) and the food is dry and tasteless and the service is poor! (i think as they are very touristy and busy it lowers the food standard and service)Definitely worth a try if your looking to eat when visiting the arab quarter! Dont go if your looking for a boozy one as they dont sell alcohol. (although they do only when your sitting outside next doors restuarant..confusing i know... ;)... 
4
This restaurant came highly recommended, and I brought my patents there for lunch. We sat outside and enjoyed watching people walk by, while enjoying a delicious meal (we ordered the bread with the variety of sauces for $23, which was very well priced). There was nothing "out of this world" to merit a 5, but it was a good, solid 4. I will definitely return
2
Sat at the next-door "blue buttons" which is the same restaurant, except with a liquor license (i needed a beer).Not a great experience.The german beer advertised all over the front of the building wasn't on offer (??) so ended up with a Tiger. OK, but not what I was expecting.Babaganus was pretty bland - no where near as smokey as I'd had elsewhere (read: supermarket-bought) and actually *way* too much. Smaller, better quality would be preferable.Kebab was basically chunks of lamb with "homemade sauce" (aka bland gravy), a dash of yoghurt, on top of "crispy" turkish bread that was just drowned in the gravy. Again - less volume & more attention to detail would have been great: I was expecting fewer, more careful slices of lamb, tangy yoghurt/tahini, something more interesting that gravy, and maybe toasted lavosh-style bread on the side. Maybe some fried onions or something? This was basically less interesting than stuff that has fallen out of the bottom of a late-night kebab from a hole in the wall in Sydney. I didn't finish it
2
This is my third try at Alaturka over the past 5 years. I come back because it's an attractive restaurant, the service is good, and most importantly, NO SHISHA. The menu and food is attractively presented. But - I totally agree with the review of SR. The recipes produce just dull bland boring industrial food. The hummus tasted like mashed chick peas that have never seen garlic, lemon, or olive oil. The best dishes in the Meze were likely from cans. The meat in the lamb pide has the consistency of hot dog and was as bland. The sauces were heavy on the corn starch and light on flavour. The best part was the yogurt sauce for the kebab which added needed excitement to a bland dish. So, it was a boring dull meal, $70 for 3 pax. I wish I could find a good smoke free restaurant with middle eastern food - this isn't it
3
The current Mrs R has an office in the vicinity, so we quite often meet around Arab St for a quick dinner and have been here a number of times. It is usually quite good, nothing spectacular, but decent enough and a decent price. So we rocked up there early-ish for an afore-mentioned quick dinner last Friday.We ordered the Greek salad, sorry I forget the name on the menu, some Haloumi cheese and falafel, and the lamb and beef Iskander kebab. I like the homemade lemonade so I ordered one as usual.We asked for everything together but despite that a procession of dishes arrived. Salad, OK, but needed more dressing. Haloumi very nice, salty and nicely pan-fried. Felafel, just OK, a bit dry though.The kebab was not good. Very dry meat, seemed left over from lunchtime, and was smothered in a peculiarly flavoured sauce. This mess was perched on some bread cubes, and the other half of the platter was taken up with a white sauce, bland and wallpaper paste in consistency.I was hungry so I ate it, but it was deeply disappointing.Overall, the service was OK, and the bill was quickly produced and was quite cheap so again that was OK. But, would I be keen to go back? I am just not sure, which is a pity as I used to enjoy the food there
5
We 4 for dinner and the food was brilliant. The lavas bread fresh and puffed up, the mezze about 8 or ten different dips, the mouzaka tasty and rounded. It was an enjoyable meal and the atmosphere was great.
4
The mezze platter is a must. Love the lava bread. We stop here regularly and enjoy the ambience both inside and out. The staff has always been lovely about accommodating large parties and more. The vegetarian dishes are our favorite---the best mousakka in town!
3
We liked the food very much, but the staff were constantly staring at us, which was extremely annoying and uncomfortable.
1
From the reviews on trip advisor we expected good Turkish food, what we got, however, was a far cry from either good or Turkish. The mezze platter was ok, the bread was nice too but nothing to shout about. The dips tasted like they came straight from a tin. Not freshly made at all.There were three of us, the first main came out after about ten minutes, the second 15 minutes after that and the last came out about another 15 minutes after the second. Food was therefore cold even before we had even started. The first two dishes were alright, sadly nothing special.The third dish dish, however, was by far the worst. What was meant to be an authentic Turkish pizza looked more like a microwave ready meal, greasy, unappetizing and the dough was undercooked. Upon enquiry we were told that the dish had indeed 'just come out of the microwave'. Having lost our appetite we left feeling disappointed and paid 89 dollars for barely touched food. We won't go back again. A shame, because we really love Mediterranean and Middle Eastern food and were looking forward to it. The decor had also looked promising

I have eaten here many times for lunch and always enjoyed the food with friends especially the home made lemonade! Really worth tryingBut for a change we went for dinner and thoroughly enjoyed the ambience sitting outside under the stars watching the locals walk past while enjoying a wonderful meal was a real treatI always have the mezza plate which gives you a selection of all their food, you may need to book a table as it was very busy the night we were thereDefinitely worth the trek into Arab Street, one of my favourite parts of Singapor

Went again on our daughter's recommendation to Arab Street to visit Alaturka.Lovely intimate restaurant inside...good feeling.Daughter ordered dishes for us to share.Started with hummous and lavash and another bread (ekmek).Superb!We had varied lamb dishes..kofte,beyti,kuzu and coban kavurma.We could not finish the meal as the portions were so generous but the waitress put what was left into containers for our daughter to take home.Total price was surprisingly low.Great value for money again

My family’s friend recommended this restaurant and we felt so excited with this place. I really want to try the real kebab.I was impressed by the decoration and atmosphere here. The staffs and manager were so friendly and kind. But we couldn’t enjoy the food totally because of the different taste. By the way, the dishes were so beautiful.The price was reasonable. Highly recommend

Our friends currently living in Singapore recommended to meet around Arab street and Alaturka for lunch. We like and, I believe, know Mediterranean food quite well and have to say it was a good choice. The food was fresh and tasty; service was fast and efficient without any unnecessary pressure. Price was reasonable as well. There were quite a few local people which also says quite a lot about the quality of the place. Definitely it is not a gourmet Mediterranean cuisine, but honest and good quality food. Good place to visit to have a break from Asian food
3
If we had just ordered lavash with the egg plant dip, it'd have been 5 stars!!However, we also ordered 2 other dishes - the fish and chicken kebab.Chicken kebab - whilst my husband prefers the chicken to the fish, the chicken was quite ordinarily in terms of taste. It's nice but just maybe slightly above average by my rating.Fish kebab - the fish is nice but again, not exceptionally impressive.There are two side dishes with both kebabs - the butter rice and the vegetables.The rice was really quite heavenly!! Resisted hard not to finish both portions (quite generous btw!). The vegetables are really no good. It made me feel like Chinese chap-chye with broccoli and cauliflower.We have had real good and authentic Turkish food both in Istanbul and out of. Wouldn't say this is authentic actually (other than the lavash and dip)! But we did spot two other restaurants outside of Alaturka that is worth a try (just by the looks of the food of the people eating). On the left is "Beirut" (but this is Lebanese!) and the other one (Sorry, forgotten to note down the name of that Turkish restaurant!) on the right of the restaurant and it says "Turkish food"! The kebabs on the platters looked quite authentic.Will probably try somewhere else for more authentic Turkish/Lebanese food in future
5
I've had so many lovely meals in this place, too many to mention. Iskander was my staple, but I probably worked my way through the entire menu 3 times over. And Turkish Olives a delight to behold. Lovely fellas always smiling too. Can't recommend this place highly enough. Bussorah Street forever
4
Definitely worth checking out for a bite to eat. Meze platter is good. Large portions. Freshly baked lavash bread straight onto your table was super tasty.
4
Nice location in Arab town. Offers alcohol too. Meat was tender and plently large servings for the money. Not a chef cuisine but dependable. They had Turkish coffee too! Servers were friendly and took good care of us
4
A great restaurant in the Muslim section of Singapore. The restaurant is set in a beautiful old world Singapore streetscape, in the shadow of a beautiful mosque. The food is traditional Turkish and done well. Service is good and value is outstanding. It left us really full and our wallet not as empty as other eateries we visited on this trip. Worth a visit
4
Hubby and I had been to Alaturka quite a few years back and were ticked off with the service (which seems to be the main grouse with most reviewers for this resto), to not want to repeat it anytime soon.Since we both were craving Turkish food and we were at Arab Street, we decided to give the place another go. We got a table fairly quickly for a Friday evening, though the guy did make a big show about seeing if he could get us a table. Anyways, we ordered Dolmas (for hubby since he's a big fan and he gave it a thumbs up), Haydari (garlic yogurt dip), Borek (spinach and feta rolls, which were awesome), baba ghanoush and Lavash bread which I had read good reviews about so tried it and loooved it. Too bad we didn't have a bigger group with us, would have ordered more of it. The only disappointing choice for the evening was Paticlan Kebab, which was marked as the chef's speciality (kebab meat marinated in spices and served with eggplant), sadly it was too damn watery, I had to fight with hubby to get the kebabs (hardly any in and we were sharing), and soggy eggplant. The Turkish apple tea has to be tried, we ordered a pot, and it was as good as the one we had had in Istanbul, definitely not to miss.I think the next time round, we will stick to ordering the tea and appetisers and skip the main course. Worth a visit..

This neighbourhood is really interesting. Sitting at the outside tables is a great way to watch the world while ingesting huge quantities of delicious Turkish food. The meze dish is highly recommended as is the ekmek to mop it all up with. And the food is great value. Really nice place - highly recommended
5
We were a party of seven, including children, and were looking for a quite place.The service was excellent, friendly yet unobtrusive. The food was very good (they have lots of vegetarian options), served fast, and non-pretentious.Bill was $100, for lots of starters and a few mains.We all agreed this was very repeatable
4
We did not know what to expect but were really pleasantly surprised at our experience at Alaturka. The menu was varied and all the food we tried was tasty. There is a bit of a problem with the service, as we cannot be the first people to order 4 dishes for 4 people, and yet there is no room for all the serving dishes on the table. The staff stood over us until we had shifted our other plates and some drinks onto a, fortunately, empty table behind. The dishes have meth heaters under them, and one was almost spilled on us during this scrabble to make room for food. Alaturka, you need to rethink the flames and get smaller serving dishes which fit onto your tables! We sat outside and it was a lovely evening, perfect for watching the world go by in this busy corner of Arabic Singapore. We would recommend this one and we will be going back ourselves soon
5
If you're looking for a great place to come to for a meal with friends, I really do recommend Alaturka. Casual dining in a small restaurant (so make sure you book on weekends) you can come here and share a meze plate and mixed kebab grill. I've reviewed this place before and can say that it's been consistently very good.Dishes are packed with flavour and meats are cooked well. Service is friendly and efficient. It's one of the better middle eastern restaurants in this part of Singapore - which probably explains why it's hard to get a seat on the weekend. Only thing to note, is that no alcohol is available, but you can bring your own or buy some at the bottle shop near by.Look forward to coming back again on my next trip
4
I visited this restaurant for lunch with my partner on the recommendation of a friend, we were not disappointed. Service was friendly and quick. Staff were able to explain items on the menu. Food was well seasoned, well prepared and presented. We each ordered a starter and a main. All the dishes we ordered were delicious. Portions are generous, we could have comfortably shared on starter and one main
4
The good stuff. Nice tasty food. Pleasant atmosphere. Good portions. Good prices. Liked the lamb pizza. Clever shape and good for 3-4 to share as starter. Not so good. Understaffed so service was average. No offering of water. Tough to get waiter attention though they whizz past you up and down.Overall: good for the area you are in. I would come back when visiting Arab quarter again
5
the bread is amazing, enjoy it with hummus! the location is cute and the outdoor area is very cozy. main dishes are also very nice and service is friendly.
3
Bread is good, main dishes is a mix blessing between average to poor quality. Atmosphere is great with nice outdoor dinning.
5
Not only best Turkish food, but the only Turkish restaurant worth visiting in the city. In line with good Turkish food from restaurants in Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Dubai, etc. Go for the recommendations in the menu, both of mezze as for main.
4
We had their signature kebab dish n out first visit and had to come back to try it again. Delicious combination of lamb & chicken with the classic middle eastern flavours. Reasonably priced. You could eat in one of 2 restaurants next door to each other - 1 with wine and beer and 1 without. It's Singapore so the wine wasn't cheap but the house wine was good quality from Italy at $10 a glass
4
I like to visit the area of Arab street with lots of traditional middle east restaurants. This time we picked this one on Bussorah Street. We had chosen few dishes which were recommended by the waiter. We had tried beef, lamb, chicken, pork... wow! So many kinds of meat all in one meal! Feel guilty but they did taste really good with strong flavor, love them! Ended up we paid like around SGD 20 per person, which is quite a good deal! This restaurant is not far from the famous Sultan Mosque in the market square, just keep walking straight from it, so you could find the Bussorah Street and this restaurant is just located in the corner 
4
Food was very tasty and fresh here, the meze which can be ordered as a starter is giant and more than enough for 2 (share between 4 if you intend to have main courses). The bread that came with it was tasty and believe it is made on site. Moussaka was good, but not great. Falafel was very good according to friends who were with us. Service is average, location is good, and the ambience from the nearby Arab street makes it feel lively. If you want beer or wine with your meal, mention before you sit down as this restaurant does not serve alcohol on it's premises but will seat you outside where they can (you get two separate bills from two companies which is a little confusing!
4
We just returned from Singapore, staying near Arab Street, so location was great. They gave us a table at 7pm with no booking, the service could have been improved a little, but the food was nice and we would go again. Having said that, you cannot drink wine in this place only next door so would have preferred they get a liquor licence
5
If you happen to stay in Singapore or visiting Singapore, make sure you spend one evening going through numerous shops on Arab Street. Once done you should definitely have dinner at Alaturka, highly recommended. The food here is really good and authentic.Liked their hospitality as well
5
Not sure why this place has gotten some harsh reviews. It's really a lovely restaurant with awesome food. Our favorite thing we ate was their feta cheese. We heard it was homemade, and it sure tastes like it. The falafel is excellent. The minced chicken kebabs were delightful too. Loved the iced tea with mint. The restaurant is well decorated and has a nice bathroom. Service was great--they're not too chatty, but they keep your ice water full on a balmy day. Enjoy
4
If you are a carb lover, you can go here for the lovely lavash bread baked fresh from the oven. Yum! Plenty of vegetarian options. They have appetizer platter with all the yummy dips and such, I love it when this is available so you can try it all. Even the stuffed grape leaves which I usually never get because my im the only one who likes them. The food was not quite as good as some other restaurants around (dips were pretty okay, falafel was very dense, baked eggplant nice, not too cheesy which I like, but less on salt). The fresh bread makes up for the minor shortages...did I mention I like the bread?? The atmosphere is great. Waitstaff is good. Prices similar to the other places around. We will go back
4
This was my second visit on a Sunday at 1 pm. The restaurant was crowded and we got a table immediately. The food is simple but delicious. Food was served in under 10 minutes. Very clean, pleasant staff and no hassles.
5
We own a steakhouse in Phuket, and know a thing or two about grilled meats. This Turkish restaurant has now become a regular stop for us whenever we are in Singapore. Its small and owner-operated, and it shows. Service is fast and very helpful, prices are very low, and the food - especially their many different grilled meats - is first rate. The owner is out and about daily, and both charming and knowledgeable. Highly recommended
3
We chose this restaurant because of the pretty decor pictured in the Expat Living magazine and were quite disappointed with the decor. When we got to the restaurant we were asked if we wanted to drink wine/alcohol and when we replied yes, we were seated in the restaurant next door, which had very non interesting white decor and the table height was too high for the chairs provided. That aside, our mixed plate appetizer was good and all of our main dishes were delicious with very large portions of rice and veggies. The house red wine was a great choice with my lamb chops. Overall the food was good and we will probably go back and try to be seated in a nicer spot
3
I went with 7 other friends and I was served immediately. We get to choose where to sit and we chose the second level which has much more space. We had the entire level to ourselves and had our privacy because the staff will leave you alone. The decorations were great. It has a warm and friendly atmosphere to it. Good setting for friends, not so much for couples looking for romantic night out.Food was average and we felt it was way too salty. Some of my friends couldn't finish their portion because it was simply too salty. A tip is to order a variety and share between friends as some dishes are less salty. Their specialty tea, which is delicious and has a distinct flavour, may help to alleviate the saltiness.Go during early dinner to avoid the crowd and have the entire second level for your group of friends and some privacy

Lunch with Mrs Deals during a weekday. The blue tiles invite the eyes well before they see the wonderful display of authentic styled food. We had the babbaganoush - fantastic with just enough garlic. A very fresh salad was a nice balance to a meat combination platter - the lamb perfectly cooked. It is worth asking for a side order of yoghurt to enjoy with this meal. Service was good but not over obstrusive like so many attempts at service here in Singapore. Our water glass was never empty. The restaurant was very clean, beautifully but simply decorated. A really nice afternoon in what was a bit of rush for the staff at Alaturka. A bargain for two at S$50. We will be back
2
We went here on a Saturday night. Had read about bad service, but nothing could have prepared us with what we experienced. We ordered one starter, one bread and a main (for 2). The starter was served in 15-20 mins. But after an hour, decided to follow up as noticed folks coming after us seemed to get their food served. The waiters had no clue & when checked with e owner, he said 10 mins. Soon enough our main was served... But guess what it was undercooked & meat (lamb chops) raw from the inside :( By the way no bread yet. So we complained & sent it back... 20 mins later they bring fresh dish served. This time e lamb was well done, but guess what the beef kebabs were frozen raw... Just gave up as it was past 10pm & wanted to be done with. Had to follow up twice again for our bread before we got it.Definitely not going back or recommending it to anyone. It's a pity... The decor is beautiful, but the team seems to have no reaustrant management experience
4
A narrow place, with a few tables on the street and not many more inside. Surprisingly varied menu, but don't come here if you want alcohol with your meal. We shared a variety of mezes, the meat shawarmas and doners were tender but the vegetarian main aubergine dish (can't remember what it was called - not baba ganoush) was quite gloopy. A pleasant plave to watch the world go by. Good honest food
5
This is a truly great little restaurant. Beautifully decorated, great friendly staff and delicious food. Really delicious food. Great for vegetarians like me and also for raging carnivores like my husband (they say opposites attract!). No alcohol - in case that is important to you in the evening then go at lunchtime. :)I love this whole area and would say that eating here (or anywhere around here really) is a must for all tourists - followed by the carpet walk up Arab Street (you'll see what I mean - "Would you like to see some beautiful carpets?" "Please come and look at my carpets.?" "Can I show you some carpets?" all said sotto voce as if it were actually some exciting contraband they are offering). A good look around the perfume and perfume bottle shops and this is the place to buy ribbons, trims and material too. Here is also where you could go to the Malay Heritage Centre except it is closed for renovations so go here http://www.singaporecitygallery.sg/images/wmKampongGlam-Book.pdf to see their walking tour around Kampong Glam instead.I digress as usual - but really - check out this lovely restaurant as it is excellent
4
I ordered the chicken doner (shwarma), hummus, and babaganoush with different types of bread. The food was delicious. The one difference I noticed with the chicken is that it was served with gravy. I have eaten at many Turkish restaurants and have never had it served with gravy. It was very good but different from what I have experienced elsewhere.
3
This restaurant was recommended to us by a couple who liked it, and we also saw it got good reviews here, so gave it a try. We thought the food was good, but not great. The service, however, was disappointing--we waited forever after being seated before we finally realized no one was going to come take our order until we flagged them down, so we did. We ordered, and then waited absolutely forever for our food--they were nice and apologized that it took so long, but then when we had to actually call out to the waiter--twice--to refill our water glasses, we finally concluded the service there is just not good. We won't go back
3
Pretty restaurant, great atmosphere , but my husband & I found our food bland. Maybe it was the time of day ( we went for a late lunch), but it was definitely a let down.
5
I was browsing the street of arabic quarter in Singapore. Found this place thank to tripadvisor and I must say that it certainly deserves higher ranking. It is unbelievably clean and the service is very proffesional and friendly.The food was very tasty, maybe except for too much onion in Tabouleh. The leg of lamb was excelent, so was the babaganoush I got as a starter. I will certainly return. Good job guys there
3
Went to the lively Arab Street for a change of scene from the posh Dempsey/Orchard dining experience. Choose Alaturka as we both love Lebanese/Moroccan food.The place has indoor and outdoor sitting and is adorned with the usual turkish evil eyes everywhere. The seating is quite basic and the ambience is of a fast food eatery.Ordered humus and a salad with one of their signatures iced teas to start with. The humus was big disappointment but the rest were ok. For the mains I went with Lamb chops which were too chewy for my taste and the sauce on top wasnt great either.Overall an average experience. We did get a change of flavour but have had much better mediterrenean food at other places
5
Authentic Turkish fresh food, great variety, and welcoming staff. Try the meze platter and the Turkish "Pizza" is delicious! Aside from the superb food, the coffee is full-bodied and rich, the tea selection is so interesting and they have a large selection of unusual juices. I just keep going back for more of the whole experience

Four of us had dinner here. "Arab Street" is a fun part of Singapore with a very special character, and very popular for the hubbly bubbly pipes, but we wanted to eat Turkish food, and at Alaturka we thought we had a good chance. Since I was recently back from a business trip to Istanbul, where I had been blown away by the hospitality, culture, food, wine and national character, this was going to be a fun follow-up.The first surprise we had was the "dry' nature of the restaurant - in the tropical heat of Singapore a cooooool beer is a good start to any evening, but Alaturk serve no alcohol so home made lemonade and grape juice had to suffice. Obviously wine was also "out" so we drank water - not a disagreable experience but certainly a novel one on a Saturday night. And definitely not a custom imported from Turkey, where there was alcohol available and consumed in abundance.Meze starter was a series of dips, and felafels were somewhat overcooked and dimunitive in size. Main courses were more inspiring, especially the betyi lamb, but the moussaka was very oily, and the fish kebab definitely past its best. For desserts, Alaturk offer baklava cakes as any self-respecting Mid-eastern restaurant should, but please, take my advice, and skip this aweful, dried and stale shadow of the real thing. We tasted and left at least half - not nice at all. Such a disappointment after the rich syrupy real macoy from Istanbul.S$139 for four persons is for sure no imposition on the wallet. But I would willingly have paid more for a better meal. And whilst the Filipino waiting staff were their typical friendly, attentive and kind selves, the (presumably Turkish ?) owner stalked the restaurant glaring at the diners with nary a word of grace to offer.Do try....for a change...but only once. And grab ice-cream anywhere else rather than waste your money on Alaturk's shocking desserts
4
Went there once again, this time with visiting parents to enjoy Turkish food. We'd called ahead but they said that all tables were full and hence couldn't reserve, so we tried to just walk-in and luckily found a table for 4 (it's quite a small restaurant and hence not that many tables, especially for groups bigger than 4).Ordered a Babakanush and Lavash for starters, quite tasty. For main course we ordered an Iskander Kabab made from lamb and beef, served on a bed of bread with yoghurt and a grilled chilly, the quality and taste were good as always. This time I tried out the stew on a bed of mashed potato puree listed under Ottoman Signature dish. That too was quite flavourful and tasty. My vegetarian wife had a stuffed eggplant, which she found quite enjoyable, I did try the gravy of her dish with some flavoured rice and the two went rather well. As always, I got their signature Turkish apple iced tea, refreshing as always.We got Bakhlava for desserts which too was quite nice. Good Turkish food in the heart of Arab Street, I'll continue to go there whenever I'm craving for Turkish stuff
5
Great inviting atmosphere, great food at relatively reasonable prices. You can sit outside, and feel as if you're in a lively Arab market atmosphere, or inside, among gorgeous tiles and hangings. There's one big table at the back that can seat as many as a dozen. We began with the rather pricey but delicious mezza plate (about $22) served with an enormous, warm puffy bread, which nearly was enough to fill us up. I'd recommend simply ordering one or two appetizers instead, i.e. the babaganoush and a slightly spicy red chunky relish--and the bread!I ordered an eggplant dish affectionately known as "the priest fainted"-- and I can see why. It was light, redolent with spices, and really, enough for two people. For dessert I ordered the baklava and sweetened Turkish coffee, and was completely, completely happy. You will be, too. My companion ordered prawns-- another enormous amount of food-- and between the two of us the total bill came to about $85. You could order half as much and still be full. This is a marvelous place to go after you've visited the great silk stalls and rug merchants. (Try 84 Arab St for rugs and Al-Madinah for a small but exquisite selection of imported silks.) Don't forget to go visit the golden-towered Mosque nearby, beautiful by day or night
4
If you're someone who judges the quality of a restaurant by how crowded it is, then you'll probably be led here because it's a popular spot for Turkish and Mediterranean food.I've had some pretty miserable salads in Singapore. For some reason we don't seem to do them very well. It's weird... you wouldn't think it'd be too difficult to make a decent bowl of salad.But the salad at Alaturka comes in a generous portion, and that goes for everything else on the menu too. Good ingredients and big serves is the order of the day here. And lamb... lots and lots of lamb.Good food and snappy service in an interesting and bustling part of town. Hard to go wrong with those ingredients
4
For those of you with wonderful memories of Turky "as it used to be"..Outdoor tables in a deliciously Oriental setting -for SIngapore!- and as mentioned in previous postings, high quality meze with the stuffed vine leaves a particular delight. Usual favorites such as Hummus and Cacik also present and made conform to classic recipes.You can bring your own spirits and wines with you. Available is imported Turkish cherry juice which can be mixed with sparkling water to make a delightful cocktail. I would also like to recommend Ayran which is a perfect accompaniment to their various kebap main dishes.The managing director Nafiz Bozkurt can also help you to pick a carpet through a side business that he also operates with Mr Faramarz
4
Have been to Alaturka a few times on my trips to Singapore. Have visited for dinner and have never been disappointed.Some of the most flavoursome middle eastern cuisine I've had (and I come from a middle eastern background). Wonderfully smokey baba ganoush, well cooked and tender shish kebabs.I enjoy finishing off the night with a no nonsense piece of baklava and a cup of black tea.The restaurant is small and is very popular for dinner, so make sure you book ahead - even if it's just a table for two.Look forward to my next visit
