I have been around this area for so long, but I only found out this place like....today??? Oh well, more about the food! They are famous for their Shabu Shabu. And what's the good part of it? Their broth! Their Aussie beef! Their customer service! Broth: Kimuchi something, I can't remember but is the kimchi-like broth that's both spicy and sweet, love the combination! Aussie beef: oh my goodness! I was thinking to myself that I hope the slices beef won't be like those that I ate at other places - so thin that I can taste anything. But oh wow, their beef slices is sooooo good la! You can really taste and eat a piece of meat! Super fresh and soft!Customer service: all I can say is superb! They will always check on us and make sure we eat it in the way that will taste the best of all the ingredients, our hot green tea is constantly top up. FYI: Oh one more thing, I'm not sure about the address of this listing's. I visited the restaurant that is located at 340 Joo Chiat Road.

Had some miso soup, salmon avocado hand roll, rainbow roll and crepe dessert. All the food was served quickly and tasted great. The servers were very polite and cheerful. My co worker and friend also greatly enjoyed the meal. Recommend if you are in the Katong area
