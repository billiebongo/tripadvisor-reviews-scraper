Tried this and was absolutely blown away. The noodles were the most springy I have ever tried. The char siew was sweet, fragrant and had no fatty bits. The won tons were nice too. The truffle noodles had a strong distinctive truffle smell and definitely worth a try. Prices start from $3 so it is reasonable

Food was served quickly and price is good. These are the some of the good points of Bee Kee.Best come on is the noodle quality. Soft bone pork provided the good taste for this meal including leafy vegetables and thin al dente noodles.The wanton wasn't bad but I think the deep fried variety leaves an oily taste on the lips.Overall, though, it was a satisfying meal

Popped over to the market to get lunch with colleagues while visiting my company's Singapore office. Lots of places to choose from and I was delighted with my choice. Service was fast and friendly. Prices are incredibly low and food was delicious! Wish I'd gone earlier in the week now! Ah well, next time ....

Bee Kee has to be the best wonton noodle in town. It's a stall located in a kopitiam in the upper Serangoon flats area. The dry-mix wonton noodle I had came with a generous serving of braised soft pork ribs that literally melt off the bone. The noodles are nice and "springy" and tasted just right. We ordered a side dish of plain wontons which came in a spicy chilli-vinegar sauce (like bak chor mee - the minced pork noodles found only in Singapore). Delicious to the last bite. I hear they have a branch nearer town, on Market Street. Really wish they'd open a stall in Kuala Lumpur/Petaling Jaya. I'd be the most frequent customer there
