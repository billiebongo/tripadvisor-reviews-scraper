Family run business with good food. Sambal fried fish and the Nonya vegetables are excellent. Surely will visit again.

Always go there at least once a month!! Usually I will order babi buah keluak, petai sambal, squid ink sotong & sambal grilled fish. Very friendly service too!!

We have only had take-out from the Kitchen so far, but everything we have ordered was delicious. Nonya style and well spiced. Servings are small

Food - ok but expensive
Service- no good as they took my plate away before I can finished my food
Ambience - normal
Crowd - no queue or crowd.
Weekday - 4 tables of customers.
Not value for money.

Overall the ambience and the quality of the food was excellent but the quantity and the price, for some, its very much on the high side.
They have quite a vast range of Peranakan cuisine that is sure to whet your appetite.

My family and I decided to come here after the famous food blogger Mark Weins gave his thumbs up and his famous head tilt for this restaurant on his YouTube channel. I had the pleasure of meeting Daisy and her family and she made us feel like at home. We ordered Babi Buah Keluak, Petai Sambal, Squid ink Sotong, Sambal Kang Kong and a few other dishes that I cant recall the names of. The food was very good. I wasn't a fan of the Squid ink Sotong tho and should have ordered the sambal sontong as I usually do at other Peranakan establishments. But its the experience that counts. Peranakan food is a dying cuisine and this day in age people just want to eat fast and prepare fast and go. This is what makes Daisy's food a pleasure to have. It is a memories of food that your mother use to prepare back in the day which takes time and patience and a lot of love. This is Home Cooked fare and we need to appreciate the diligence and hard work that Daisy and her family put for trying to keep the age old traditions of Peranakan Cuisine alive and well. The Restaurant is located a little far from the city centre in a Housing estate. We had to get a Taxi to get here and due to the outskirts try to organise a Taxi for your return. Waving down Taxi is hard to come by in this location. The food is a touch pricey but it all comes down to weather one feels as tho its worth it or not. In this case I feel its worth it just to experience the cuisine in itself. Well Done

This restaurant was not easy to find if you take public transport, as it sits in an enormous public housing area but is absolutely worth the search (from the Clementi MRT station that exits into a mall, go down to the ground floor and through three different sections of public housing and across two roads - wear comfortable shoes). Their food is wonderful, made with excellent fresh ingredients, cooked with skill and care. Their rempah (spice pastes) are all different depending on which dish it is used for. The emping (deep-fried belinjau crisps) are fried as you enter the door. We had four dishes, the grilled, stuffed fish, petai with ikan bills, meatballs with water chestnuts, and braised pork belly. All of the dishes were delicious and satisfying. The grilled fish was superb, fresh and perfectly cooked. The spice paste used to fill the cavity had a touch of sweetness to complement the fish. The petai was also extremely fresh and sautéed to the optimal point. I loved the meat balls, they were soft on the inside and crisp and savoury on the outside. I could eat them everyday.In fact, we concluded that we'd eat at this restaurant every week if we lived nearby. It has a simple setting so come with your friends who like to eat well and are not fixated with appearances. It looks like the owner's money goes into the ingredients and making things properly. It's heaven to be able to sit back and enjoy such as good meal without having to spent hours beforehand making each dish

Having come a good review from a non- Singaporean, I decided to try the food at Daisy’s Dream Kitchen on a Saturday night with my family.DDK is located at HDB neighbournood area of West Coast Road. We took the train to Clementi MRT Station and walk about 20 minutes to find the place because we took the incorrect way. From Clementi MRT Station – cross the overhead bridge towards Clement Stadium and walk straight between the stadium and nearby condominum- cross the road – Block 517 is just about 5 minutes away.Simple decoration with homely charm plus authentic Peranakan food, DDK is the place you would like to bring your family/friends for a meal and cosy chat.We did not order too much as there were 3 of us. It was also our first time here. Like many reviewers have pointed out the portion is small and yes, it is pricey.We ordered babi buah keluak babi, otak, chapchye and egg plant with lady finger. My daughter also ordered a bowl of bawang kepiting soup (minced meat with crab meatballs) for herself. Food was good. I liked the sambal belacan that you can dip with the emping chips. Babi Buah keluak (nut from Pangium edule) is well cooked with the meat of the nuts which tastes like chocolate (so to speak). The dark gravy also goes very well with rice. The pork is soft and tender.The otak is squarely shaped instead of the common long strips type. Not too spicy and is home-made.Egg plant and lady fingers are stir-fried in a sambal chilli paste which taste quite good. Chapchye, a kind of stir-fried mixed vegetable stew is mild in taste. I like the natural sweetness of the cabbag

The food & service at Daisy's Dream Kitchen was top rate. The staff was always smiling & friendly to me. They were also rather efficient. The pork curry (can't remember exact name) here was so unique, it stayed on my mind for several days. I've been meaning to return & bring some friends here to try the unique foods that are made in keeping with family recipes. Food at Daisy's perfectly captures the eclectic blend of flavours that cuisine in Singapore has come to represent as different cultures celebrate their culinary heritage with plentiful access to the best ingredients & the hungriest of customers like us who are waiting to be surprised time & time again

Went for dinner with my brother and sister. Although the food was tasty and the service was good, the portions were just too small for the prices they charge for the various dishes.

They serve authentic and super good peranakan food. Place is a bit small, location is in good neighborhood.

Daisy's Dream Kitchen offers great home-cooked Peranakan food. Start with the belinjau nut crackers with sambal chilli. Followed by a bowl of traditional Peranakan soup with pork and crab meatballs. The fresh mackerel fish meat mixed with rempah and coconut (otak-otak) is a must-have. The babi buah keluak is an interesting twist to a familiar Peranakan staple - soft pork ribs are used to cook this dish instead of chicken. Last but not least, the assam chicken - sweet, sour and spicy goodness

To eat at Daisy's is a wonderful trip down memory lane, simple ambiance, 50's music (they were playing a cha-cha cd and my classmate and I wanted to get up and dance like years of yore), and authentic food. The food is as good as I remember from my last visit and I still rave about the pork bua-kluak, ngor-hiang, ink sotong (squid - to die for) and the timun salad though the cucumber could have been sliced finer. Yes!! must go there more often esp. since parking is so convenient! And yes, a little pricey

I enjoy the food at Daisy's Dream Kitchen but I wish they serve brown rice with their food. It will be wholesome. Prices are pricier and smaller than Ivins but they use quality ingredients and the owner told me there is no msg in their cooking. Seating capacity is small hence I avoid the weekends. They have a value lunch deal. Service is fast and friendly. Complimentary water is served. Their some made sauces, sambal belachan are awesome ! A hidden gem

Me and 2 friends went over for Saturday dinner. Beef Rendang was watery and meat was a little tough. Chap Chye was bland. Grilled fish with stuffed sambal was average, it had the fishy taste and the fish was obviously not fresh. Sambal kangkong was way too spicy. Only dish that was somewhat tasty was the Ngoh Hiang. Also, servings are too small

Growing up with Peranakan food, it is fair to say that I'm an extremely brutal critic of the cuisine I'm most familiar with. Besides anything by the famous Chef Damian D'Silva, Daisy's is the only place I would trust to put together an authentic and delish Peranakan meal. I've brought visitors from Scotland, Austria, Belgium, and other parts of Asia to Daisy's and everyone LOVED the food here. Recommended dishes are assam prawn, buah keluak ayam, babi sio, stuffed fish, and ngoh hiang. But just about any other dish on the menu is a pleaser too. If you are a visitor In Singapore, Peranakan food and specifically Daisy's Dream Kitchen is a must-try!

Location was a bit secluded as its hidden among HDB shophouse. Went there twice on a Friday and Sat. Highly recommended to make reservations on Sat. I really love the sambal balachan and crackers. Her must try dishes are really good with plain white rice. Do order the barley too, its the home made kind with a tinge of pandan. Feels like eating at grandm

We spent the evening with our best friends and their family, celebrating our collective birthdays and anniversary there. Our friends recommended it and the food was perfect. Cooked and prepared deliciously by Daisy and her family of helpers. It's not an easy place to find, but worth the trip to West Coast Road. For someone with true Baba tastebuds, I considered their dishes like Bakwan Kepiting, Babi Buah Keluak and Sambal Petai Ikan Bilis authentic and flavourful! We went back soon after our first visit and it will not be our last. Keep up the great cuisine, service and homely hospitality :

Normally have the Beef Rendang, Otak, Ngoh Hiang and a random vegetable dish. They all taste great, although I find their servings to be slightly on the small side.Special info: This month is their 3rd year anniversary, and they are provide complimentary dessert for dine in only for this month
