Every course is surprisingly delightful and unique. We had the privilege of the window seats and had the best view of Marina bay.
Strongly recommend for those who wish to to dine under the stars with good dining experience.

Went for Sunday brunch, food and service was good. Dessert was excellent. Looking forward to visiting Monti again soon.

We had a valentines dinner at Monti. 460$ for 2. For that price I was expecting to be dazzled. That hasn’t been the case. The food was good, not stellar, the waiter very kind, but the dinner expedited in 30 min (to squeeze in most of the long waiting list I guess), no background music or ambience. That wasn’t worth half that price. I won’t go there again

We went here for our anniversary and it was lovely experience. We ordered the Tomino (?) for starters and it did not disappoint - the plate was too pretty to eat, and the tomino was wrapped in bacon so you get the contrasting texture of crunch and meltingly softness of the cheese. The swordfish was also good although a bit dry. We were served by Logan who was really great and attentive all throughout our meal. When were about to pay our bill, he surprised us with complimentary desserts and drinks - it was a very thoughtful gesture! Photos included as the dessert plate even had an anniversary greeting for us :)Definitely a place to come back to

Booked for dinner to celebrate husband's birthday. Complimentary glass of prosecco presented with a flourish and a smile from the maitre'd.Our waitress was friendly, professional and helpful and provided us with an insight into the menu. Seated at the window provided us with a lovely view of the bay and we really enjoyed our evening
5
I booked this place under Gastromonth (paid for a set menu) and unfortunately there was some miscommunication between the organizer and the restaurant and the restaurant couldn’t find my booking. We offered to take the issue up directly with the organizer if they can’t accommodate the ordered menu and just go with the usual menu. However, the staff took ownership and were able to manage the situation well. They even provided us substitute options for food no longer in our ordered menu which I thought was really nice of them. The place’s lovely as well at night. Would love to go back again.

we had been to Monti for our anniversary on a weekday...the appetisers were yum and met the Monti fine dining standards ...mains were disappointing and desserts were yum to finish on a gd note. Overall it’s a grt place with a grt view with friendly staf

We went to this restaurant for Christmas Eve. Food was good, not excellent.But one big problem was with the reception. For Christmas Eve, the restaurant had 2 fixed price menus - for $138 and $180. The Indian lady at reception gave us only the $180 menus. Later we found out about the smaller menu.Did not appreciate this sharp practice

Monti (the previously ‘Catalunya’ Restaurant at Fullerton Pavilion) turned out to be a big disappointment:There were barely only 8 guests (excluding us) dinning on a Sunday evening in a cold functional space poorly maintained with fuzzy yellow stained glass overlooking the panoramic view of Marina Bay.Food was deceivingly suboptimal-their chicken consomé was edible but not impressive, the recommended ribeye steak was an overdose of fats which left me nauseated (i had to wash it down with the red wine), their burrata pasta was soggy and lacks flavour. The much anticipated and probably “overrated” jazz band turned out to be just a soloist passing time. Staffs appeared lackadaisical and sloppy with their mismatched attires.I reckoned Monti won’t be staying afloat on the pavilion for too long
5
The view of the light show was fabulous, as was the decor and ambiance. The food was delicious and a feast for the eye as well. We loved how it was so inventive and beautifully presented. Art on a plate! The service was excellent, too. We had a wonderful, romantic and intimate dinner. It was one of the high lights of our visit to Singapore
5
wow. this is the first time we experienced dining in floating restaurant with stunting view of marina bay sands. food are really awesome and i specially thanks for the chef felix.
1
We booked this place for a Sunday brunch with friends and it was extremely disappointing.Why ?The service is very inefficient despite that the place was not full on Sunday :We have been waiting so long for the pasta more than 45 minWe had to repeat our order twice for the soup.... waiting time 30 minCoffees were served without any spoon... we saw the coffees to be delivered .... waiting at the bar for almost 10 min....No bread available for a brunch...There is no drink list ???? We asked twice.The table has not been cleaned at all (removing used plates) during our brunch The food is slightly better than the average For 110 sgd per head ++, it was far too expensive.This is not the service that we know and we can expect from the Fullerton. Barely a 3 star hotel
5
My boyfriend brought me to monti for my birthday and I really enjoyed the food and beautiful setting. However, what really left an impression was Tristan. He is an exemplar of great service and made my birthday even more special by putting in extra effort to take great photos and capture these beautiful memories for us. Thank you

I first heard of Monti when I had a dinner between the collaboration of Monti & Plentyfull.The fainty little touches of finesse on the food was impeccable!!!Later on, I'd decided to visit Monti and I wasn't disappointed as well. The value lunch with such a view was mind blowing. The food has definitely been categorised Italian but the bold touch of salted egg yolk wins it all. The team definitely seems more flair out with the dinner at Plentyfull, I guess after all, too many cooks doesn't necessarily spoils the soup
5
Our second visits in Monti in November and December ! I think we are coming back in January, February, March.... because Chef Felix remembers what we had last and every meal is a surprise! Omakase is great option when one is spoil with choice! Fabulous and creative Omakase from Head Chef Felix plus great service team of Martin! Great food, good service and fantastic view of Marina Bay Sands! Pictures speak a mountains !

We are staying in an hotel nearby. Saw the location on the marina bay waterside and decided to go for lunch. The place is almost empty except for a small group. Waiter comes to see us and ask what we want. We said an aperitif and sparkling water. Turns around looking upset. Strange ! We ordre the meal ( dont order a la carte with an angry waiter ) and a chianti. Waiter comes back with a bordeaux and an organic chianti. The wine we asked for is not available. The wine list is great but i suspect that it is just a list. Food comes it is excellent and the wine to ( even cheaper ). Waiter seems happier by the minute and offers us a limoncello on the house. We will go back.
4
We wanted somewhere with great views that was open early & this fitted the bill. Food was tasty but not amazing. Service was slow to start with but improved once a new male waiter seemed to adopt us. Glad to have experienced it. Not sure Iâ€™d rush back. Cigar dessert was interesting & views were great, changing as night fel

I was at Monti for the first time after 5 years living in Singapore, to celebrate my 35th Birthday. From the reservation with Ms Suganthi until the last minute with the Guest Relations Manager, Mr D'Silva (in fact, he is such a pleasant gentleman, makes the enviroment even better!), was PERFECTION! The food is great, and the portions are quite big if you compare to the usual served in Singapore. My husband said that his meat (CHARCOAL GRILLED USDA PRIME RIBEYE STEAK), was the best he had in Singapore during all this years. The drinks... Awesome! Thank you so much for the great experience! I will see you soon, for sure! :
4
The views from here are brilliant. Romantic! We tried the 5 course omakase menu. First 3 dishes were very good. The 4th course the rib eye, was a little too fatty for my liking. They served us a mango sorbert but we were craving for chocolate so we got served the specialty on House. Would have missed this otherwise. So recommend picking of the menu then the omakase
4
Was back at Monti to welcome an overseas friend who is a fan of steak. After a good 10 minutes browsing of the menu and also personal recommendation of Chef Felix, we decided to go for the Omakase menu. The cold lobster entree was a genius (my friends had the fine de clair oysters and I wasn't a fan of oysters) replacement for me! Second was the signature scallops entree (that salted egg shavings were irresistible). Generous portion of the creamy foie gras with the well-cooked risotto. The OP Ribs was quite a sight on its own without much garnishing. Char-grilled to perfection and simply melted in the mouth. The whole experience ended with a refreshing yogurt ice cream with berries compote (nice touch!). Service was alright but could definitely improve. Wasn't too please with being asked many times of 'How's your dinner?' unnecessarily. Music was just right
5
Perfect location looking out. Feels so relaxed when coming here even during a working day. View is great by the window. They have a live band on weekends. Food is good too.
2
The service problems were bizarre. I spend a lot of time raising my hand trying to get service (raised my hand 20 times during 20 minutes) and finally walked over to get somebody's attention. Wait staff were not overly busy but they kept serving certain tables and ignoring certain tables. Appetizer was great. Cocktail was a creative flavor. Main course and dessert were ok. Some friends joined me at dessert, and after that I thought we'd get better service, but again I waited 60 minutes with empty water glass and 30 minutes with empty cocktail glass, constantly interrupting conversation to raise my hand. Never got a refill. Finally I just paid and walked out thirsty. I wouldn't have stayed so long but the band (soft blues) was great. The owner must be losing a ton of money on un-bought drinks
5
I would like to thank Monti for making my proposal to my girlfriend (fiance now! :) ) a reality. The place was a perfect space to execute my dance proposal and I could not thank the staff more for their assistance. I would like to especially thank Newman D'Silva, the Guest Relations Manager for being very understanding and helping me out with the execution of the proposal. Before the proposal day, Newman made sure the setup required for the proposal was what was discussed for the past couple of weeks. He made sure everything was ready the day before. On the day itself he made sure everything was in order (my fiance didn't suspect anything!) and also made sure all my friends and family had a good time. His service is exceptional and we would definitely come back to Monti! Thank you Monti :

Was here for the first time since after Chef Felix is coming on board and celebrating my girl friend's birthday. The view is awesome and overlooking to MBS (night time is a best location for the laser show). Not crowded on a weekday lunch hour.We ordered a Set Lunch ($38++ per pax, RSVP thru Chope apps for 3 course is $34++ only) Anti PastaMe : Smoked Swordfish SaladGF : Lobster BisquePrimi E SecondiMe : Seafood StewGF :Spaghetti CarbonaraDolci (dessert) Me : Matcha Fondant GF : Rum Ba Ba. What surprised me and my girl friend was the dessert!!! Look very beautiful and the taste was Soooo good! Especially my favourite Fondant cake really melt my heart away. At first when I saw is a Matcha Fondant cake, I was thinking that must be a little bitter taste (not a matcha lover). However, again, Chef Felix amazed me again with his Fondant cake (tried his salted eggs yolk fondant cake in an event). My girl friend who don't like sweet stuff also surprised by the Rum Ba Ba. Both of us just love it at first bite! Need cheer up on Monday Blue? Want to avoid lunch crowd in CBD? Want to buy your BFF fine dining birthday lunch with a million dollar Marine Bay view? Farewell lunch for colleague?YES! Monti is an awesome place you should never missed. Will definately come again for Chef Felix's signature dishes.

We had a business function at this restaurant, which is right on the Bay Marina. Our opening drinks and canapÃ©s were held on the rooftop, which offered expansive views of the Bay Marina. From there you could watch the light show in front of the Marina Bay Sands. When we went inside to eat, it was cool and refreshing. And has a very elegant and modern feel to it. It is circular, and has an outside deck if you want to go out for some (warm) air.The food was spectacular. We had alternating selections. Each course was beautifully prepared, and cooked to perfection. I'm not sure how much the meal cost as the company paid for it, but it was a highlight of my visit to Singapore.See my photos for the view from the rooftop deck.
2
The beautiful metal domed building by the Fulllerton is now occupied by Monti. Service was disorganized and really lets the whole experience down. After a long day at the office I asked if I could put on (nice, linen) shorts as it would make me more comfortable, but was told by the maitre'd they are not permitted as per the dress code. 20 minutes later a table sat down next to us, with 2 people wearing shredded jeans shorts. . . . There is a painful band that set up a stage and played music so loud that we could not hear any of the conversation at the table. Half the food was good, and half mediocre but 130++ per person. Room was mostly empty on the Thursday before Formula 1 weekend. This placed is doomed
4
The 3 of us went for dinner on a Friday evening. The band was playing, music was great! As we were struggling to decide what to have for dinner, the head chef Felix came to our aid. He suggested the chirrata for me as I wanted seafood. The amadai which is a Japanese fish for my gf & wagyu beef for my guy friend. The bread came in cute little knolls. It tasted a cross between croissant & focaccia. We had 3 types of olive oil to choose from which was an interesting twist as compared to typical restaurants. We started off with the kale salad which had the kale cut into bite sized portions, great for ladies! My gf found the cheese a tad too strong as it tasted like blue cheese. Personally, I like blue cheese so that was great for me. My chirrata looked great, tasted even better. There was mentaiko on top of my pasta. Chef Felix prepped me to stir it well before taking a bit of my pasta. One bite & I could tell that the pasta was home made. I dug into the flesh of my lobster & was greeted with flesh that was cooked just right, not too rubbery not undercooked, bringing out the natural sweetness in the crustacean, undoubtedly a live lobster seconds before it was brought to its doom. My gf's amadai resembled a master chef dish. We were surprised to hear from the chef that the scales, along with the flesh can be consumed! Th flesh tasted sweet & firm, the scales crispy & tasty. The yuzu sauce that was drizzled over the salad provided the tartiness to balance the bitterness of the rocket. The asparagus was grilled just right.My guy friend's wagyu came medium rare, tender yet flavorful, seasoned with salt & pepper. It was a delight every mouthful. The service staff was not as attentive as the chef's attention to the food. If this can be looked into, the dining experience will be elevated. What is great food without good service?Be sure to take a stroll outside after dinner to capture the view on ur phone! Definitely Instagram worthy pictures!We will definitely be back for the lunch menu! Hopefully service will be better as staff will not be suffering from TGIF's symptoms, waiting to knock off!
5
went there for dinner, was introduced by a good friend.service / food excellent.head chef (Felix) takes the time to come out and explain courses / ingredients, A* service from him and the staff.desserts are a must try!. try it and you'll see why you'll recommend your mates too
4
Came back again for dinner with my extended family and as expected, was a feast to my palate. Totally in love with their August special, Chilli Crab Agnolotti, a dish that Chef Felix had created to commemorate Singapore's 52nd birthday. The crunch of the mini soft shell crab and the tangy chilli crab gravy paired with handmade Agnolotti, a match-make in heaven! Service was satisfactory and our little girl was very well taken of

As a rule I have always been cautious of eating in restaurants which are virtually empty. However it was just starting to rain heavily so we thought we would give this place a try. Starters were good but main courses very disappointing, under cooked spaghetti.The worst apspect of this restaurant was the terrible service.The place was only 25% full and the floor staff were overwhelmed and struggling to cope. When we pointed out the under cooked spaghetti, the chef was brought out from the kitchen to argue about it. There is always a reason places are not full. A very disappointing evening
5
Went for dinner at monti last week and was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food. My favorite was the steak and ravioli. Service was attentive and the view was excellent.
5
After a disappointing experience at another venue next door we walked in hoping to get a table for dinner. This restaurant does not disappoint. Fantastic Italian meals and service. Great atmosphere and relaxing live music. Highly recommend.
5
Went there with my brother and my uni mate for lunch. Rather than opting for the normal weekday set lunch, we had the chef prepare something for us. 4-course meal and the sommelier paired us with a white to start and a red later. Every course was well thought after and we were very satisfied after 3 course. Dessert!! Now, that's my favorite. It looked like a cigar and has special salt, himalayan smoke salt perhaps. Best way to end the meal. If you're not up for fancy lunch - go for the set lunch, it is delicious. Otherwise, definitely worth the effort to RSVP and try to make it out for long lunch or dinner!
5
It's not often I write about great service in Singapore but when it happens to extra ordinary levels it should be recognised. Not only did we get fantastic attention from the very cool Singaporean chef but also the manager and sommelier.The degustation menu was fantastic and with the matching wines, excellent value for money too. The chef changed 4 of the courses as my partner didn't do red meat/pork no problem at all.It was also her birthday and they gave us a cake for free and served up the roses I had sent no problem.Every member of the team from front of house to back office and everyone on the floor especially the Chef who cooked the most amazing chili crab pasta dish were fantastic to us.Highly recommended
4
Dinner was really good, had one dish that wasn't to my taste. Nice white house wine and excellent service. And what a great view over Marina Bay! $$$$, but Singapore is expensive. Only downsite is the loud music when the jazz night is on. You cannot have any conversion anymore.
4
My second family trip at Monti and as usual they do not disappoint! Was here for my baby girl's one year old birthday celebration and we had requested for Omakase experience. Ambience was great and the dishes were excellent. Special shout-out to the ribeye steak with charcoal-grilled sweet corn and asparagus! It was tender to every single bite! My favorite was the strozzapreti with italian sausage ragout as the pasta was freshly made in-house. With its location strategically on the Marina Bay's waterfront, the view is a incredible
1
Food: poor, doesnt worth the $Service: very poor.We ordered a bottle of white wine from the restaurant manager but it wasn't served at all! So we cancelled the order and changed to sparkling water yet again nothing was served!! Will not recommend and will not go back again
5
Nice Ambience. Great Music! Breathtaking views of Singapore Marina Bay nite's view. And Most Importantly is Excellent Service, provided by Newman & his crews!!! Great job & well-deserved 1st Class Service in recognition of Newman & his service excellence in ensuring ALL 35 of my guests thoroughly enjoyed ourselves throughout the nite there! Thanks Newman!!
5
Celebrated my cousin's birthday and the Manager Newman D'Silva made it such a memorable time. Not only did he go above and beyond to make sure everything went ahead without a hitch, he came and checked in on us multiple times throughout the night to see if there was anything MORE he could do for - really rare to find such exceptional service in Singapore. All 40 of us had an amazing time so thank you for making Monti feel like home for us that night. P/S beautiful location & the views you get of the at Monti is spectacular
4
I have not yet eaten at this restaurant, but have heard good things about the food. Will try one day. I'm writing this review to talk about the live jazz that is played at Monti. It's an excellent line-up of different configurations of local jazz talents, most of whom have their own recorded albums already. Though you may see foreign personnel in the band's line-up, these guys have lived in Singapore for a long time, some for decades. Regardless, the music is stellar and able to stand tall among leading jazz clubs around the world. The setting for the music is really good, with all tables focused around the stage. And it's nice that people do go there FOR the music. The drinks here are as reasonably-priced as the venue's setting would have you presume -- classy, stylish, romantic, great view. The service is prompt, but not entirely warm, unless Newman is there. When I've called ahead before to ask who's playing, the lady on the phone didn't know! She had to put me on hold to ask; this was after the band had started to play! Hmph... another restaurant who doesn't recognise that the live music is as much on the menu, as the food and drinks! Hopefully Monti will keep their place classy & artistically rich with the current live jazz repertoire and not descend into dismal, insipid offerings next door at Clifford Pier

went there for dinner. service was great. waiters explained in detail each course.
food was spectacular. ingredients were fresh and tasted great.
beautiful view of the Singapore bay area was always an added plus.
5
We had a spectacular meal last night at Monti. We chose the Omakase menu and were not disappointed. The chef was able to design our meal around my dietary requirements and the food was just lovely and very tasty. Great jazz band, beautiful location and good service. Altogether a perfect night
1
One of the worst value-for-money in the CBD (even after discount!). Food was nothing to be amazed at and in micro portion. Only the violet dessert was good. The rest was nothing exceptional. But what was even worse was the service. The waitress made 4 mistakes on the appetizer for a table of 2 people! To a point where manager had to offer us an additional glass of wine (Chianti) for waiting so long. Unfortunately its one of the worst wine I drank in a restaurant in Singapore in 7 years and it is priced at 22$++ the glass. I really miss the cook/service which used to be at the pavillon: Catalunya, this used to be top notch! Hope this new place Monti close soon
5
The wife booked a lazy sunday brunch for an early birthday celebration. Setting was as good as it gets, beautiful view of the Marina Bay, Singapore River, bet it'd look great at night as well.The buffet comes in various combinations, food (+ drinks/wine/premium alcohol). It starts with an amazing seafood platter of crab, oysters, sashimi, tuna, mussels etc. Followed closely by meat & cheese platter than table side risotto.Different from your usual buffet, you order each portion & dish as to your liking, a very much different experience as compared to people stuffing these faces & making a run to the buffet line after each time. Here you'd get a much classier experience.For the other dishes we had 2 pasta dishes (one recommended by Martin their manager) and one created by us, obviously his combination tasted better. Meats we tried the foie gras, ribeye, sea bass, pork ribs & the really good pork jowl (which we had 2!)Yes there was still dessert to go after the entire meal. Quality food, great ambience.But best of all we had a wonderful experience with Martin & his team who were extremely attentive & courteous. Martin, we actually met before at his previous restaurant and he's definitely a strong reason to head back to Monti. His knowledge & passion for food is admirable, eager to share and takes it on himself to ensure everyone has a memorable dining experience.Thank you Monti

We saw a board outside advertising a lunch special menu so decided to give it a try. When we went in the door the staff looked like they had been working in the kitchen, very scruffy for front of house staff. They showed us the special menu and explained that an a la carte version was also available. We were shown to a table with a lovely view and given menus which were commpletely diferent to what had been advertised or what we had been shown when we first enquired. We were then told that the special menu didn't apply and we could only order a la carte. On principle we walked out. Anywhere that treats its customers in such a shoddy way doesn't deserve my custom
5
Monti (which stands in the space at Fullerton Pavilion previously occupied by Catalunya) is fast becoming my new fav hangout. Panaromic views of the singapore skyline aside, this restaurant and bar sits regal on Fullerton Bay and is staffed by a stellar crew accompanying the upbeat vibe of live jazz - special shoutout to Newman and Martin for their attentive bottle service, warm hospitality and bringing back the old world charm of jazz over whiskey and good conversation. Looking forward to my weekly visits!
4
Was at Monti for the Italian Day fest. Had some light bites before proceeding down to the main restaurant. Ordered bar snacks which was innovative such as squid ink crackers. And the chili dip packs a punch. Spicy and tangy taste. It's a good idea to have a few folks in a group to sample the selection of dishes. Cigar chocolate was interesting. And the chocolate dome dessert was nice as well.
5
My family and I went to Monti for the first time to celebrate me and my wife's wedding anniversary. The restaurant exuded warmth, was filled with affable staff who generously gave us recommendations on what to have and the place was accompanied by a breath-taking view of MBS. The food took a little while to be served to us as there was a mess up of orders. However the mess up turned out to be a blessing in disguise...afterwards, we were treated to complimentary drinks by a team of nice service staff (Newman and his partner)! Also, The pasta and risotto that my family and I had were delicious! It's a tad pricey but worth it. The real climax of the night was when the staff surprised me and my Wife with a spongey chocolate cake with the words "happy anniversary" scrawled in chocolate icing! It was indeed a delightful surprise. In addition, there was a jazz band to spice up the night! Classic. There was everything in Monti, food, music, view and polite staff. It was truly a night to remembe
3
We were seeking a great Italian restaurant in Singapore ... & we're still looking.Yes, the location is awesome, with great views over MBS & the Bay; but the food is uninspiring & service clumsy. Entrees across the six of us included Carpaccio (smoked swordfish & Wagyu beef) which was ok, as was Burrata.Mains were Rabbit Ragout with Tagliatelle (dull); Wagyu Bolognese (underwhelming); seafood in traditional Sardinian pasta (so-so) ... you're seeing a trend of being underwhelmed. Compounded by waiters everywhere but no one helping you ... "sorry sir, but I just bring the plates" or similar is constantly heard when asking for wine menu, parmesan, pepper, etc. Very disjointed service.
2
The location of Monti is great, stunning views- however we were very disappointed with the service and the food itself. It was just average, definitely nothing special for the money you are paying. I ordered a vegetarian truffle risotto and requested to have no cheese. Our server said that this was not possible and that he had to "Check if the chef was in a good mood". Our server then went away to check and said that they could make me a scallop risotto instead- to which I reminded him that I was a strict vegetarian so I dont eat any animal products or dairy. He then went away again and about 20 minutes later I was served a scallop risotto. With cheese. Everyone else at the table had been served their meals and were waiting for me to start eating. I told the waiter that this was NOT what I requested. They took my plate away and then served it again 2 minutes later with the 3 scallops taken off of the top of the risotto (to which their inprints were clearly visible!!). For such a nice restaurant with a supposedly good chef, you would think they would be able to cater to your dietary preferences. Apparently not. The 3 non-vegetarian people at the table were also not impressed, we have all had better Italian meals in Singapore. It would be a nice place to get a drink and watch the light show across the bay, but wouldn't recommend the food
2
Limited selection, service crew was unresponsive except for one who was probably the floor manager. We had to wait quite a bit for the food. The ghocchi was good tho.
4
It was a nice spot for drinks overlooking the water. Didn't eat there but worth a visit for drinks and the view
2
For lunch, Monti is good value in the CBD where set lunches are expensive. Also the view is nice However as a work venue for a lunch the food we not great. I has the salad (vinegar and sauces were too strong) and the fish (don't understand the purpose of the air dried fish skin which did had an odd texture). Service was lax/staff were very new and need training (fork and knife set wrong way around initially) and no atmosphere (and people). Disappointing
4
Enjoyed a lovely evening at Monti. Table by the Bay overlooking MBS. All the staff were very attentive and the manager made some excellent wine and food suggestions. We shared a kale salad and had the rub and gnocchi for the main course. Both the mains were well cooked and flavourful. The Bomba desert was extremely well presented and delicious- highly recommended. The only disappointment was that they charge $12 for a herbal tea which feels like a rip-off. Expect to spend 100-125 per head with a glass of wine.
4
this is a lovely restaurant housed in a really cool location, in a pavilion on its own, next to the fullerton bay hotel, overlooking the amazing sky scrappers and the iconic marina bay sands. you have to walk a little from the hotel as it's situated in the middle. came here for lunch and was greeted by friendly staff rosa . had a lovely set lunch - the menu is not pricey and 2 of us ordered 2 of the set lunch so we could share. was perfect. the proportion of food is just right. beautifully plated. great view and service - i forgot the waiter's name - good service. would love to return for dinner - i think the view would be even better at night. they have happy hours and even sunday brunch
5
One of the criteria when we selected this restaurant was that it's opened till late. We were very hungry when we reached the restaurant at 9.45pm. The waitress was very attentive and helpful, after our order, olive bread was swiftly served hot with 3 different types of olive oil to choose from. Each type is very different but all are nice although the bread is already very tasty by itself. We ordered Baby squid and beef carpaccio for antipasti. Baby squid is sour yet sweet due to the tomato base while the lemon juice on the raw beef gives the meat this freshness. Both are highly recommended. Main was Ravioli and mister had Iberico Pork. Mister loved the texture of the pork, crisp on the outside and chewy meat. Ravioli was home-made with veal filling. Dessert was chocolate cigar and ash served with olive ice cream. Oh my, the cigar really has this oak-taste. Special thanks to manager, Mr D'Silva who gave us 2 glasses of champagne after knowing that we were celebrating our 10th wedding anniversary. The view outside is stunning, overseeing MBS while sipping champagne. Will love to try out more dishes from the menu.
5
I proposed to my fiance on the roof of this establishment. The staff helped with setting up the flowers I had delivered, a table, and were delightful in their service the rest of our day. The service was phenomenal, food delicious, and the view of the water is of the best in downtown. I couldn't have asked for a better way to celebrate this important event, and to top it off the price was incredibly reasonable. I'm hesitant to write this review because I want to keep this location a secret for as long as possible, but Monti is top notch and deserves some great reviews
5
Was there for my birthday dinner treat from the girlfriend. Ordered Beef Carpaccio, Ravioli and Gnocchi, not disappointing at all. Food quality was top notch. Then ordered the special cocktail with Macallan whiskey and Gin and tonic. Great. We got a nice view of iconic MBS from the restaurant along with the attentive service from Mr. Newman. Very friendly and accomodating. He got us the best view table in the restaurant overlooking the MBS and move us to best seat in front of the live Jazz band. He makes the overall dining experience great! Will definitely come back again
5
My wife and I visited Monti while in Singapore over Easter. The restaurant is on the waters edge at Marina Bay with great views of the Marina Bay Sands hotel. Unfortunately the laser light show was not on the night we visited as it was a public holiday. We tried the cocktails which were fantastic and even had one outside after our meal to finish the night off. The food was excellent as was the service. We found the staff to be pleasant and engaging, especially Mr D'Silva who chatted with us for a while after our meal. I will certainly be visiting again on my next trip to Singapore
5
It would be easy to say that I only went to Monti purely for its amazing location right on Singapore river looking directly at Marina Bay Sands. I did. But I would go back because of the staff the music and the amazing drinks. Joeseph the chief mixologist did not disappoint. His knowledge of the art of blending spirits second to none but it is creative deconstruction of classics to add a modern or unusual twist is his brilliance. Best new Old Fashioned I have ever had. Don Draper would be proud.
4
The food is excellent. Unfortunately we came at a very busy jazz night with loud expats. Beautiful view at the MBS.
3
Not sure if it's because it hasn't been open for too long but the service seemed a bit unsettled as did the food. We had a fantastic night with two other couples but wouldn't go back on purpose.

I was not sure whether we were having lunch in restaurant or club.
It was midday but the music was blazing. We saw what we thought was Chef but he was busy behind DJ booth. Oh well maybe one time off :)

Was here last week and had their set lunch. Presentation and food were decent, but dessert selection was limited as they had 2 choices, but unfortunately one of it ran out. Service staffs were friendly and nice in general, one of them overheard that we had a colleague's birthday today and offered a complimentary cake to us. Thank you! Breads top up took several reminders though. Female host looked quite solemn. The view was nevertheless spectacular, and prices were rather steep.

I wanted to like Monti as it is in the same premise as Catalunya which used to be here. Catalunya was swanky and classy but somehow the new owners of Monti has turned it into a cold functional space with no ambiance despite the wonderful view!! What a pity!! The food is ok, but the place was empty on a Thursday evening. Overall, disappointed that a previously beautiful restaurant has been turned into a function room with no character coupled with just ok enough food and bad service (which unfortunately is common in Singapore due to difficulty to get good service staff)

I remember Spanish lunch with my banker in this dome-like venue some years ago. Today the interior is home to a bespoke cocktail bar, fine dining Italian restaurant and jazz lounge. It presented an opportunity to taste test this recently opened establishment and enjoy the surrounds. We arrived earlier for evening views of Marina Bay and the iconic Marina Bay Sands. A cocktail eased us into dusk and twinkling lights. The interior echoed with a soft glow that set the mood for a romantic dinner.Service was chatty, polite, attentive and especially helpful with suggestions. The assistant manager Selvan orchestrated a selection of dishes in consultation with us and Joseph, the bar manager paired them with several cocktails. While the food and beverage menus were inspiring, we hardly needed to refer to them. We started with a moist and creamy burrata, when paired with the robust olive oil brought back memories of Murgia in the south of Italy. The risotto was perfumed with the aroma of freshly shaved black truffles, the ravioli was paper thin morsels heightened by lemon rind, and the slices of grilled Iberico pork was delivered mouthful of juicy flavors. We finished on a high note with dessert theatrics courtesy of pastry chef Jasmine in the form of a dissolving chocolate dome and creamy olive oil ice cream. Joseph's concoctions introduced a whole range of classic and contemporary flavors made even more delicious through the expert use of international botanicals and fresh local ingredients. He served up some of the best cocktail alchemy around town. The dinner was well paced alongside the cocktails, giving us the opportunity to savor the attractive creations of both kitchen and bar. Selvan also returned regularly to check on each dish, offering to immediately replace any that were off-taste and shared feedback to the kitchen. Dinner soon eased into a late night of sultry lounge jazz. The soft atmosphere and crooning of timeless hits coupled with a digestif was a lovely wrap to our romantic sojourn. We are already looking forward to the next romantic evening in Singapore

Everyone should experience :

We decided to check out this Italian restaurant at Fullerton Pavilion. When we entered, the place was like a pub that has not yet started its business for the day. The layout & seating arrangement were messy in concept & had no wow factor. My guest & I loved the warm, delicious crusty mixed grains bread with olives that was served with our 3 course set lunch. Our sous vide beef starter didn't look nor taste special, the plating in fact was odd. Next was the freshly made pasta with wagyu beef - it was luke warm & under salted so we would rate it an average at best. The camomile ice cream with honey comb was a good & unusual combination, albeit very sweet. We ended our meal with good, fragrant coffee.Overall we would rate the food & ambience an average

Held a corporate gathering of about 120 people for Tuesday night dinner. Monti put on a delicious 4 course meal, with salmon and beef fillet choices, and with cocktail party style drinks beforehand. Efficient service, nice ambiance and well prepared dishes. I sense it is fine for much smaller gatherings. Very centrally located near to the Fullerton Hotel

I love the design of Monti so much. Where is located at right beside Fullerton Bay hotel. The design of the restaurant make you feel like you just on the sea. There is a good place for wine too.. If you are a wine lovers, yes, Monti is a best choice. There are offering $ 20 for 2 drinks now. What you waiting for!!

The food is quite good and interesting. Service is great. Very friendly and funny staff who make you feel at home as well as taken care of. Felt like we were regulars even though it was our first time dining there! Was a good night!They have a executive set lunch menu that sounds very reasonable if you work around there

We had a company dinner at Monti, and came away relatively happy with the experience. There was 14 of us, but because of the layout of the restaurant, we had to be split into 2 tables that seat can 8 each. Boss was not too pleased... oh well. A word on the beverages first... The wine list is quite decent. Mr Bartender is really passionate about his cocktails, which I appreciate. I'd rate my interaction with the sommelier as average - I invited his opinion, but I felt that we was not sure enough of himself to give one, always deferring to "depends what you want". On the food... Good selection in the menu, and we ordered a good variety of dishes, all of which were very good. I didn't hear any complaints. The entree platter of cured products and cheeses was somewhat curious, as it looks more French than Italian... but was delicious. There was a selection of 3 different E.V. olive oils and 1 balsamic vinegar for the breads. If you order their risotto cacio e pepe, you'll get table-side service, where the owner-chef comes out and gives a lovely show. It was nice, and does add to the dining experience. I had a very good pork dish (can't remember the name; it was served with polenta), and it was quite sizable. But what was disappointing in size was the burrata - there are a few restaurants out there that gives you a better sized and similar quality burrata. For desserts, we order almost all of the selection, and I personally enjoyed my "lapsang suchong" tea infused chocolate cigar with olive oil ice cream. The others were quite good too.Service wise, if this restaurant is to be a success, it needs to improve this area. Seems to be too much unnecessary movement by too many staff. Should just have designated waiters who know what to do. On several occasions, we had to ask a second time for something, or they didn't give us what we wanted.Overall, a good restaurant with a fantastic view and good food. It's not cheap, and can certainly be a place to impress, as long as service improves. Recommended

Food, ambience and view was excellent. Waiters/waitresses might need a bit more training because you would expect absolutely impeccable service from a high end restaurant like this. They had to keep going off to double check with their colleagues when we asked questions about the menu. Also, after we paid the bill, we had no service at all. (usually, you get a "thank you, have a good evening" but we got absolutely nothing

Monti offers a very good range of Italian authentic dishes with very high quality products! The homemade pasta was amazing and super fresh. The staff is gentle and able. Finally, the location is superb: on the sea with circle view on the Marina Bay Sands...wow! If you are looking for Italian food, there is no better choice :

I went to Monti after it just reopened and this place delivered and whilst it still has so much more potential; the fact that the owners are continuing to step up every time will keep me coming back. The food was good, and the cocktails were wonderful plus they are doing a great whiskey even at moment and I am somewhat partial to a great single malt. Monti's location lends itself to catering to all different types of markets. They definitely have a weekend brunch potential to target a different type of client. That of course could lead into their evening crowd which morphs into a fancier club feel after dark with its very fashionable beautiful people feel Great job to the team there. Prices aren't horrible and whilst it's not cheap, it wont send you to the poor house

It's has a beautiful view, absolutely amazing cocktails and great food! I went there for my boyfriends Christmas party, and we had a three course meal - the pumpkin soup was delicious, the beef melted in my mouth and the dessert was the fab! The staff are very friendly and assertive. We will definitely be going back!

It started so well with a warm welcome by friendly staff.... but then it fell apart. The waitress had to keep asking her colleagues for information and my beer arrived full of ice cubes...! Weird.We just wanted main courses, which we ordered with great anticipation! The bread was fabulous which always bodes well for the rest of the food...They delivered my family's meals and said that my risotto was just coming. After several minutes and multiple requests I was told it was almost ready. It finally arrived, lukewarm, after my family had finished their meals and was so salty I could hardly eat it. When the bill came my risotto was there which surprised me. When questioned they did remove it but not the automatic service charge.Lovely location; lovely devour etc but if you want to eat I'd go elsewhere - there are so many choices...
