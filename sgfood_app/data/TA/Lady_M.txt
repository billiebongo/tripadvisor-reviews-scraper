The mille crepes here are the star: light, creamy and really a nice afternoon treat. The decor is meant to exude sophistication but the white lighting lets it down a little. Service was acceptable, nothing to rave about but nothing to fault either.

This is the place to head to for good quality cake in Orchard road. Great for meeting your girlfriends or generally make a recovery pit stop. The millecrepe cake (we ordered the chestnut version) and the cheesecake were of beautifully made and delicious. On a busy weekend afternoon be prepared to queue. Service is of a reasonable standard though harried.
