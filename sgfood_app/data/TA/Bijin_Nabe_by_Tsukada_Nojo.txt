Food was great, Service tops it up with great scores.
Attentive introduction by the wait staff to run us through what and how. This is probably one of the rare few restaurants I am willing to queue for.

The collagen soup is always good. Table is small. Suggest if you have 5 pax split up 3+2 you will get a better portion then all 5 in a table

If you like chicken and soup, then this is seriously the best we have ever tasted for soup seeped in chicken. You feel full just drinking the nutrient rich- infused broth. Every single creamy drop seemed so precious - it is hard to leave any leftovers even though we were stuffed because it felt like we were throwing away liquid gold! we enjoyed the sweet potato noodles too. Not sure if we looked any younger after but it sure made us feel very happy and good after - which is saying a lot !Apparently long Qs during dinner so we go only lunch time (Liang Court branch) and it's very lovely

Bijin Nabe (Liang Court) Located at #B1-01/03, 177 River Valley Rd, Liang Court, , a casual dining ambience that whips up the finest Japanese delights. Enjoy a unique spread of the freshest vegetables, seafood and chicken basked in their Signaturee Golden Collagen Chicken Stock, it is simply the best. The golden collagen chicken stock came in pieces, No salt, no msg, and it tastes so good. On the whole a must try for all steamboat lovers, It gave me another view point of having Japanese dining in a sophisticatedly way. The Staff are very professional the service is excellent and very friendly and attentive. The food is beyond expectations. Overall, So Satisfied, We Couldn't Ask For More

Always not disappointed whenever coming in here, but only in terms of food quality. The service is a mix at times. Sometimes they did not bother to explain step by step, some they even forgot to give us the small black sauce for the rice/noodle. The noodles > rice. I always find my overseas guests to this place because 1) its uncommon, very interesting soup origin 2) very tasty and healthy, even to those with more refined tongue. Though however, not most of my guests share my extreme enthusiasm

Visited the outlet at Westgate. Everything was good except maybe no air conditioning while eating a very hot dish. Eating while sweating is not the least desirable. 1h 40 minutes to enjoy hotpot was honestly too short, if only they could lengthen it to 2 hours. We just want to enjoy the food, not rush through it and worry about the time all the time.

Average chicken .. Average soup.. Below average ambience, good service. Chicken is ok but not as good those in Japan. Soup is thick but does not have the pure chicken stock taste like those I tasted in Japan... I am sure they have things added to the soup

We walked in to the restaurant at Liang Court around 6 p.m. and were led to our seats without waiting. This is one of the four outlets in Singapore and the only one which does not serve ramen. The chicken in the soup was free range from Japan farms. The meat was very fresh, tender and juicy. The soup which was stewed over 8 hours with chicken bones, salt and water only was clear, rich in collagen and flavorful. It was emulsified like tofu in room temperature. The standard hotpot food featured shrimps, chicken, minced chicken meat balls, deep fried tofu and plenty of fresh vegetables and choice of different types of noodle. There were several special homemade sauces to enhance the flavor.We ordered 120ml pure brew sake - Hakkaisan which was crisp and dry and went well with the food.There were a few surprises over the meal. The first was a small plate of special sauce in a heart shape which made the soup tasted differently. The second was two pieces of tiny jello dessert in a big plate with two cartoon figures, with a heading celebrating our occasion. The last surprise was 2 cards for free drink or food, which can be used even in all of Japan's outlets. The waitresses were very professional and knowledgeable about their own food. Most importantly, they made you feel like home. If you still have appetite, you can order a big glass of Japanese green tea at S$1 for unlimited refill. We could only go for one glass.We enjoyed our evening far beyond the dinner. What an amazing dining experience in Singapore!

The chicken soup was aromatic, tasty & rich without being cloying. This is the best, most authentic chicken soup base for a hotpot meal.The staff was in a hurry to cook all the ingredients at one go. This is not the best way to eat hotpot. By doing so, the medley of vegetables ended up overcooked which nullify the nutrients of an otherwise healthy meal
