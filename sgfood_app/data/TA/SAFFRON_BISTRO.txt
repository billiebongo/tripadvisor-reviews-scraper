I went to saffron after many years - and was pleasantly surprised to find the food and service still consistent. A 15 sgd set lunch was more than adequate and the service was efficient and not pushy.
The restaurant while relatively busy was not crowded.

I was very positively surprised about this restaurant. I ordered food online and I must say quality is very good. I must say, quality is much better than many restaurants in India itself and taste is truly authentic.

We decided to try this restaurant based on the menu. It is one among many in this area. The food was excellent and the service was good. Would recommend.

If you are looking for an Indian in Singapore this is the place you want to go. Set just one street away from the Singapore River, the restaurant prices are a lot less expensive than those on the water. Fantastic food- best butter chicken we have had. Service was a little strange the waiter (which may have been the owner) sat at the back of the restaurant all night on his computer and would only come over when I asked

My husband and I found Saffron by chance when looking for somewhere to eat on Singapore's National Day on 9 August, and certainly struck lucky. It is quite a small restaurant but smart. The menu is displayed outside. It offers North Indian cuisine, and the quality is absolutely first-rate. We started with paneer and Punjabi samosa, with aloo gobi and mixed vegetable jalfrezi served with naan and rice to follow. Quite delicious, and excellent, attentive service. We recommend it unreservedly

I've had a business lunch here and have also had a takeout. In both cases the service was professional and courteous and the food very tasty. Especially remember the takeout chicken madras had a thick rich spicy sauce with a nuttiness which I believe is imparted by the ghee

we happened to be looking on a Tuesday afternoon for a lunch place around Raffles place; this restaurant was just near the place. Our guests from India, one of them wanting a Jain meal were well-served with quick efficient service, much to our relief. Prices are of singapore standard which one should get used to pay for. Nice place for a quick lunch, sure recommend for patronage

I used to eat here a lot until I moved to a new office area. The North Indian food is quite good and tastes quite authentic. The food isn't too expensive for the quantity and taste. My favorite is the aloo parantha with paneer butter masala; load up those cals! Their dessert is quite good as well. A gentle tip - if there are two of you for lunch, the a-la-carte menu is cheaper than the set lunch. Location is quite prime as well. Right between Boat Quay and Chulia Street

We have been here tonight for dinner (09NOV2013) and it was perfect.Food was very delicious and good quality at a reasonable price!! The service was very attentive and friendly. The interior of the location is simple and straight forward. Nothing special but very clean and tidy.If you look for great indian food - this is the place to be!! :-

I admit it is close to the office but the food is really good and decently priced for Singapore. The dry Chili Chicken is amazing but it is spicy which is how I like it!!!!Service is fine - always very helpful. Probably not a place for a special occasion but when you are out and about it is prerfect.Overall Good food, defo worth a visit
