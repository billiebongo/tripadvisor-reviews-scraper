Very nice ambience. Gives the guest a feel of old Shanghai. They play soothing Chinese jazz music. The restaurant thoughtfully uses chinaware and even serves beer in an ancient teacup like those used in the Ming Dynasty. Even the design of the menu is impressive. Overall, two thumbs up for the ambience!! As for their food selections, try their chicken soup - well stewed and served with N'uerhong wine

Had a nice dinner, various delicious dim sum. New mixologist mixing cocktails on Friday and Saturday nights ex Bar Stories - very good! Staff are almost over friendly and would do better if they wore similar uniforms - our server was wearing a loud singlet which would have looked better in a backpacker bar. Smarten up and the place is a winner

Very cool place. You're brought back in time, circa 1920's Shanghai. The furniture, the old advertising posters on the wall transports you back in time. Enjoy sipping sake from small cups and eating great tasting food. The wine list is impressive too. I would definitely come back
