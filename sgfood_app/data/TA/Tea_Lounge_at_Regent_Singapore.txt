The spread is small but every dish was delicately prepared. Food was excellent. Service was impeccable.
5
The service is very good and the waitress and waiter are very attentive and pleasant. The melodies from the piano was just perfect for chat
5
Went there for the afternoon tea and I was impressed by the golden apple dessert. The staff is very knowledgeable and are able to explain every single tea. The outlet's style is very elegant and placed in the middle of the lobby.
4
The ambience is excellent. I was initially not happy that our table is next to an escalator. However, there was no traffic and we love the corner we were at. Time passed by without us even knowing.
Food was so so though.

My husband and I had the afternoon tea at The Regent. We had a tier of sweets, savories and scones. We could also select a dessert each. The dessert was the highlight. My husband who is not a sweets person said the dessert (golden apple) was worth the cost alone due to labour and presentation. We could also have dessert from the buffet which had chocolates, macarons etc. The only criticism is the scones could have been warm as they were a bit cold and hard under the airconditioning.We could also select two serves of tea per person. We both had a black tea upon arrival and a green tea during dessert.This is probably one of the better value afternoon teas I have had so far and I have tried afternoon tea in HK, UK and Australia

The tea was set in a re-decorated tea lounge in a colonial tea planters theme. The decor is very pleasant and the seatings are well separated so you can have a conversation. You have a choice of a normal table setting or a sofa and armchairs lounge seating. The staff and very professional and polite. Good things to say about the weekday tea menu as well. For $55/++ is turned out to be more than we expected and delicious. The set comes in a triple layer tray with finger sandwiches, quiche and scones. The quiche was well executed - small by still moist and tasty. The scones I found a little dry. The piece de resistance was the dessert selection. The are four kinds and since there were four of us we ordered one each to share. They were gorgeous to look at and delicious to eat. The presentation was creative and the combinations proved the chef's skill in marrying different flavours together. They were delightful and creative. One of the staff told us that in addition the lounge will be offering a small buffet of more desserts. We were quite full from our tea but it seems others crave more. You also get to choose 2 pots of tea or coffee so give yourself plenty of time. Two hours goes by in a flash. Kudos to the team
5
Enjoyable Sunday lunch, exceptional service, delicious food, good variety and a brand new feel to the ambiance. Well worth the cost especially if you are spending it on family or loved ones. But do not waste your money on salads and cheese just because indulging is not your cup of tea. Learn to spend and live a little. Tea Lounge deserves that respect.

We always try to go to the Regent Tea Lounge at Christmas - it's my son's birthday and his favourite place- they always make you feel so special. I love the way they treat you as an individual. Although online payment is required for Christmas bookings (only Master and Visa on the site) - a quick call to explain I wanted to pay by Amex and it was "no problem".Lovely refurbishment (apart from the new teapots which are the worst pour!) and fabulous food - all quickly replenished, super fresh and delicious. Amazing turkey, wonderful sushi and the most beautiful desserts.Special thanks to Salvatore who made sure everyone was individually greeted and made to feel special - the staff here are really exceptional, they think, have the ability, capacity and wherewithal to make a decision (swapped teapots, bought extra toasts) - they just seem to have it - plus there isn't the huge turnover of staff that Singapore seems to suffer from - you see the same friendly professional faces each time you visit. It makes a huge difference to the experience.We're always so impressed by the Regent and can't wait to visit again soon

they introduced to other guest when they serving. but only served us without introduction. and the tea cannot be refilled.the golden apple is best of all.

The Tea Lounge is a cosy place that my husband and I enjoy dining at for it has never failed to please our picky tastebuds (and my high standards from the service staff.) Food: The spread is simply a feast for both the eyes and the stomach. The wagyu steak is carved to your desired doneness, the laksa gravy is always thick in coconut, the broiled salmon just melts in your mouth, and the chilli crab with mantou dip is what most people dive straigt into (hint: request for a bowl to maximise the treat.) The newest additions that I have noticed since the renovation is the addition of kueh pie tee and peking duck crepes. The crepe skins could be made smaller to let the duck skin be thoroughly savoured. But no big deal! The canapes and the cheese station stood firm on it's own, with a constant need to be replenished so you know they were mighty in flavours in spite of their small sizes.The standard of the desserts were taken up a full notch, I was blown away by the meticulousness in crafting these little chocolate cake jewels. Valrhona dark chocolate with chestnest creme? What a stunning marriage of flavours! The usual suspects such as the local kuehs were present, also with the other likes of apple crumble and ice cream.The drink selections are one of pleasurable treats that are featured, I enjoyed the Shanghai rose and the Mocha is to die for!Ambience: The recent renovation saw a complete overhaul in the Tea Lounge, and I am loving the new look! Warm lighting, nice plush seats and cosy booth seats for a more intimate experience makes it more attractive. The drinks are now prepared in front of the live stations, for your viewing pleasure. Staff: Every visit to The Tea Lounge is also a lovely encounter to catch up with the amazing staff. They are simply one of the best service staff I have met in Singapore; they are the sort who exceed all the boundaries of making your dining experience a completely pleasurable and utterly memorable one. Salvadore and John has shown great leadership and warmth to have such a brilliant team. Sheila, Mel, Rose and the team of chefs are always up for a quick chat and are full of spirit and cheer in spite of their business. Their attentiveness to details blows me away every time. It was my wedding anniversary, and the staff surprised us with a lovely cake. The talented pianist who is always there to play the sweetest melodies chimed in with a song dedication. Final Verdict: The Best Tea Lounge in Singapore!
5
Warm staff, inviting, good and quality spread. Calm atmosphere and nice music. An excellent and enjoyable high tea.
5
We had very comfortable and luxurious Afternoon tea time at tea lounge. We suggest to choose you signature "Golden Apple" for the main.
5
We will definitely visit again and the crowd is just nice and not too many tables. Other than these, all is fantastic!
5
Although the spread was disappointing, the quiche and sandwich was yummy. The dessert was, of course, the highlight! It was yummy and pretty. Will be back!
5
I visited Tea Lounge again with my partner today as we miss the signature laksa and king prawn congee very much. As usual, the head Chef, Chef Chong welcomed us with his Char Siew and followed by Hokkien Mee. Other than Excellent, I have no second words towards his foods. My partner was enjoyed so so much! Thank you Chef and team!
4
The quality of ingredients and the spread was enticing. The management knows that their cakes are the highlights of the tea. Hence, the centre stage placement at the entrance. The seafood porridge, roast beef and Yorkshire pudding we're lovely too.The affable service staff were friendly, offering suggestions for the tea selection if you are undecided
5
I returned back to my favourite hitea venue at the Regent Tea Lounge at Regent Hotel. I loved the buffet spread so much that I keep coming back. On 4th November when I was there my favourite chef, Chef Chong personally served me crispy pork. On my earlier visits he served me delicious fried hokien mee. On one occasion be even surprised me with double-boiled herbal chicken soup. The entire staff are great and very approachable. I loved the lobster congee, satay, sushi and their wide array of cakes and nonya kuehs. They also have a wide range of teas
5
Been eating a few buffets this year end festive season and it has been a long long while since I last came to Regent. And my, I should have some back earlier! The hi tea food selection is not massive, but is somehow very well put together, high quality and very well executed. It has a nice mix of Asian, Japanese and western like laksa, kueh pie tee, sushi, roast beef, salmon confit. All oh so delicious! Cheese corner and caviar bar, and of course, the final delight to end the meal, the dessert bar with both local keuhs and western patessierie delights. Everything so scrumptious, together with the beautiful drinks like iced chocolate and selection teas, and wonderful attentive service staff who quickly cleared the plates and refilled our drinks. Indeed a beautiful afternoon spent and well worth
5
While this is a moderately high priced high tea, the quality of desserts and excellent service more than justify its cost. Worthy of mention is Chef Chong’s impeccable char siew that is roasted to perfection. Oh yeah, and his signature hokkien mee that is quite unparalleled among local 5 star hotels. We are equally impressed by wait staff Jennifer’s ever earnest and cheerful disposition that so sweetly perfect our experience on this lazy, rainy Saturday afternoon. Keep up with the good work
5
I was celebrating a special birthday and I wanted to experience my 1st high tea. I loved it all. Starting with a glass of bubbles then enjoying all the savory delights but making sure I left enough room for all the sweet treats. All the food was very delicious. The service was very attentive. We had booked the 12pm sitting but asked if we could change to the 3pm and they accommodated our request no problems. I throughly enjoyed my high tea experience and thankyou to everyone for making it memorable
5
My family and I always visit this place for high tea due to its consistently high quality and spread of food available.
5
Newly renovated. Came back for the weekend high tea. Must try the lobster laksa and scallop congee. Service is prompt and staff are friendly.
5
Enjoyed our high tea throughly. Top quality - food & service! Different types of Caviar on the spread. Love the scones too!
5
Very impress with the food and service. There were new items like crispy roast pork n peiking duck. Desserts seems somewhat lesser than previously but food quality still the same high standard.
5
The waitresses were really friendly!!
And all foods were delicious. I was surprised about the desserts. Quality was excellent and it was like art!! I want to go again 💓
5
The service received from all the ladies who served us was wonderful! As we were first-timer, they guide us through the dishes, the tea as well as the dessert. We are very satisfied with the food and experience at Tea Lounge. They definitely exceeded our expectations!!
5
Staff are polite and attentive, ambience is perfect. The 3 tier high tea is served with high quality ingredients, with the $10 off promotion it is definitely worth it. Car park is complimentary when we dine at their outlets. I'll definitely visit them again and recommend my family and friends there.
5
This is my first visit after the renovations. The layout has changed and the dishes have also changed slightly. The spread of food is not the widest but every dish I had was good! From laksa to crackling pork to the OMG experimental char Siew from the chef!!! Plenty of caviar, good tasting and fresh sandwiches. Yums scones, waffles, gorgeous macaroons and best Cheng tng. The seating is now in 2 sessions due to reduced seating but it is easier to navigate without running into another person/table and conversations are not privy to being shared across tables at normal volume. Selection of teas is not the widest nor is it TWG but it is definitely well brewed and tastes as good. Service is outstanding as usual. Impeccable and happy staff are a delight in SG. One of my indulgences <
5
Although it loses a bit of it homey cosy feel after the revamp, but the new dessert selection can way compensate the lost. The new dessert selections are not only super instagram worthy but also taste very good. But hope the free flow of coffee/tea can make a come back. Overall, still a nice place to have your afternoon tea
5
Good attitude and service from the team starting from my reservation to the end of our meal.Made a last minute call to book for a table, but they were full. However I was not being denied immediately, the manager actually took the effort to put me on the waiting list and finally arranged a table for us. Great appreciation from us.Next was the spread, we find that it is just enough. From appetiser to main to dessert, not too many but just nice, you do not need to think what to eat and what not to for a buffet. Servers were attentive as well. Will recommend!
4
Ambience was relaxing and cosy. Food was tasty with wide range of tea for selection. Service staff was attentive and friendly, meticulous in her tea preparation and made recommendation on the desserts to choose. Will definitely come back for the high tea or buffet.
5
The service crew are knowledgeable and able to explain clearly and recommend. The food is full of surprises and the quantity is a lot for such price.
5
Food was delicious and attentive service provided by Alice and Jennifer. We had a great time there. We will definitely return.
4
My 2nd time to Regent's hi tea, still coffee and scones still as good. Service is very good as well.
5
Had a wonderful time relaxing over tea. Service was warm and cheerful. We were pampered. However food portion was a little too small compared to most other high tea places. We had to go elsewhere for supplementary meal.
4
Had the 3 tier tea set. Good quality food and tea. But note that this is by no means a meal. Line your stomach prior or prepare a snack after. Pricey.
5
The people at this place make the experience wonderful. We enjoyed the food and variety of teas and coffees, nice music. Great place and environment for Ladies gathering.
5
High tea food is normal, dessert is good and service top notch! Recommended if there is some sort of deal or discount, otherwise, it's a bit pricey for the high tea set. But the place is super nice and the service crew is one of the best i've seen in Singapore hotel. Should definitely check it out if you can

I trusted reviews & booked a weekend high tea @Tea Lounge for me & my wife. In Singapore, all year round there’s lots of places offering credit card promotional discounts & 1for1 offers. Despite it is one of the most expensive high tea currently we do not mind, we wanted good food & comfort. Sad to say, when we've been looking forward to something and our expectations are high, the reality can sometimes disappoint.My wife met with an accident & was on a wheelchair for a yr; when she’s walking again naturally I wanted to treat her to a nice buffet. I made booking several weeks in advanced and called twice to ensure that we will be allocated to a cosy, quiet comfortable seats. I have described in elaboration what “comfort” meant to us. Though this lady name Mel sounded so insincere & robotic on the line but I still booked it with gd faith as it is a reputable brand which received lots of gd reviews. I was shocked when she lead us to our seats, it is exactly what we hated most. We are grande size & my wife felt very uncomfortable cramped to her operated left leg. We approach Mel & told her about it, I was amazed when she told me: “maybe next time when you come ....”Dear Mel, once bitten twice shy. There won’t be a next time. Please learn to exercise flexibility. As we have prepaid vouchers bought we just try to make the best out of it. Our next table there’s 4 ladies talking & laughing at the top of their voice, taking photos with their mobile phone even when they are eating. The table ahead of us, there’s 2 kids running around, their parents too busy eating. The table on our left with a baby, the mother change diapers & stripped him naked right in front of me while I was eating. I totally lost my appetite. So, this is our much anticipated weekend high tea buffet at Tea Lounge, The Regent. Food wise was nothing out of the ordinary. We’ve tried almost a little of everything on the menu though there’s lots we don’t seem to find. What we saw on the menu was impressive. Lots of variety but not quality & tastes. Nonetheless, most of the service staff are polite especially the male staff. The young Chinese guy that mend the local delights & the barista in spectacles are most helpful. At the end of our meal we had another ordeal witnessing Mel struggled with how to redeem our purchased vouchers. We finally settled our bill after about 25 mins.We did spoke to the Manager call Salvatore & their GM Peter Draminsky was just 2 tables away but unfortunately he failed to understand our point of view. He’s also don’t seem interested if you’ve broke a leg or not but we thanks him for his time anyways. You see, the human mind is an empathetic, problem-solving agent. Humans naturally try to make connections with people and help solve their problems - that’s human nature; it starts with having less robotic customer service.To do well it has to be run by suitable people. The ability to run it is certainly a pre-requisite. The quality of who's running it is crucial. A good leader could take you to heaven; the wrong leader could make our life very hard.If dinning at ordinary places for a fraction of a price feels almost the same or better why are we dining here?My conclusion, Tea Lounge is overrated, definitely not Crème de la crème if u r expecting it to be.
5
I and my wife was at Regent for Sunday afternoon hi tea. The ambience is nice, service is good and warm despite them having high work load as all the tables were filled. The food were overall very good, especially the deserts which were impressive. Sous Chef Chong runs a good food service and was particular about food quality, serving aside dishes like Hokkien Mee that add a special touch to the food service so that it is not all just pre-prepared buffet type food service. We have been to quite a few hi tea services around Singapore, this is certainly one of the best we have been to. Highly recommended
5
I loved variety of tea and deserts options. Tasty fingerfood and exceptional sweets. Golden Apple is the best!
5
The service was good. Also they have a lot of tea selection. And food was just right to us. Especially their scones were good!
5
Good customer service, staff was always friendly and polite. Food was much better than the previous old selection, desserts were pretty awesome too! Great place to hang out with love ones and friends. Can't wait to bring my family for high tea soon!
5
High tea set was good! Esp the quiches and scones. The separate dessert item was very unique. Had the apple and chocolate forest one. Both were good! Though the apple one was on the sweet side. Service was good too.
5
Service was great. Details of how the food and beverages were prepared were explained. The servuce crew were attentive to the needs of the customers.
4
I had a 3-tier high tea with mini sandwiches and pastries. The handcrafted desserts was a nice touch. Great service.
5
The observant service crew has noticed my birthday balloon and arranged for a birthday cake to be served :) that was really thoughtful and sweet. Thumbs up to the excellent services and food!
5
Choice of dessert was very interesting. With the 1-1 chope deal, this is simply fantastic. There's piano music at the background too.
5
After the renovation, i saw so many differents.
Amazing dessert and attentive service.
Will definitely come back
5
Friendly & attentive service personnel. Relaxing ambience. High quality food prepared and served with love! Had a wonderful time there.
4
An excellent venue for an afternoon tea session~ Service is awesome~ Just a little expensive~ LOL! =)
5
Service and Atmosphere very good for friends meeting place. Food is good too. Price a little expensive. Overall experience is good.
5
satisfaction guaranteed , be it in food, service, atmosphere and value for money. Been here twice since opening and will definitely recommend this to my friends and families..
5
Enjoyed the buffet and the new set up!
Lobsters laksa and congee are to die for!
Service is very warm as always! Keep it up!
3
Good venue to unwind with friends and family. The service staff are polite and patient in advising you on your orders etc.
5
It was a very positive experience. Quality of food and presentation was excellent. Service was very attentive. Great atmosphere with live piano. Very good value.
5
The service was excellent!! Everyone there had a big smile on their face! Always keep look out for what we want! Great relaxing atmosphere! Excellent high tea set with the best coffee ever! Amazing Golden Apple dessert! Appealling & tasty! Would definitely go back again!

Next time if I have ever visit Singapore, I might check it out but for now I write as a average on this place.
5
WOW with a capital WOW. We had the Sunday High Tea Buffet and were blown away by the quality of the produce, variety and expertise of the cooking. Highlights include a lobster laksa, the best pork belly, Peking duck, authentic satay, a caviar station, a soft oozing bread and butter pudding with raspberries and a caramelised apple crumble with vanilla bean custard. The patisserie made up of dozens of mini desserts was the best I have experienced. So often this can be a case of style without substance but each morsel was an intense flavour bomb that left the taste buds tingling. At $60 per head it was amazing value. A must do if in Singapore
4
The 3 tier tea set was great as you get to choose 2 drinks (tea in pot, coffee, chocolate) and you get a choice of a main dessert besides the stack of standard items for each guests. The quality of the items were pleasing though the quantity can increase slightly. Overall a good experience.
4
Tea was soaked too long, slightly bitter but food was good though. The portion was too little for a 3 tier afternoon tea. Service as good..
4
Presentation of the dessert is very interesting , something that will be a conversation piece for a while. But the food on the 3 tier is rather small and may not be enough for a guy.
5
great waiters and service, food was substantial and experience was good. hotel was clean and classy so it was a good afternoon
3
Savory was much better than the sweets. Staff were very courteous and helpful although it took our group a very long time to order our tea. Exorbitantly overpriced for the high tea buffet.
4
One of my favorite hi-tea buffet. Ambiance is great with live piano session. Great selection of buffet items both savory and sweet.
5
Always have the same positive experience with every visit - good food, great service. Appreciate the birthday cake and greeting
4
Overall experiences is good. Serving time for the high tea is a bit short. Need to rush to finish my drinks.
4
Decided to have afternoon tea at Tea Lounge again after it reopened on 12 Aug 2017. The last time that i came was 2 years back and both my friend and I had a enjoyable afternoon tea there then.This newly opened Tea Lounge looks welcoming, the service staff are very friendly and approachable as well. The 3-tier afternoon tea set provides quality sandwiches and scones. Good tea served as well. I personally would recommend Regent Blend for tea lovers. The service staff who attended to my friend and I is Sheila. Her service is fantastic, very attentive to customer needs. Minus point: only 2 service staff moving around the tables serving, taking orders, doing payment etc. Perhaps can have one or two more staff so that customers can be attended to without much waiting
5
Yum-yum ... a very nice touch to separately serve piping hot Hokkien fried noodles and Tempura. Buffet spread had splendid variety - the signature laksa was a bit of a disappointment (not "lemak" smooth enough - maybe not using coconut milk but skimmed milk). Having live piano music rounded up a perfect afternoon tea.
4
Pick this place for a birthday celebration. It was a weekend hi-tea. Food was good, fresh with a fair amount of selections: sushi, salad, spinach & smoked chicken quiches, dim sum like xiao long bao & salted egg yolk, satays, deep fried chickens, cheeses, peranakan kuehs and all sweets creations. Live stations for laksa, roast meats, chilli crabs and the premium prawn congee (most popular). Service was attentive but rather regimental. The air con fluctuates as the lounge shares a common atrium and there may be noises from nearby wedding banquets
5
Nice buffet high tea with excellent service in a cosy ambience. Will definitely visit again with friends!
4
Food is delicious, wide variety.. friendly staffs and nice ambience.. good for friends or family gathering.
5
Brought my wife to Tea Lounge for her birthday high tea buffet.........it was great!!! ^__^ She enjoyed the meal and the service was excellent. They even brought a cake with candle for her....
5
My husband and I took my mother-in-law for the Weekend Afternoon Tea Buffet at the Tea Lounge at The Regent Singapore. What can I say? Perfect experience! Walking into the hotel, there are gorgeous orchid settings in the lobby, and then the Tea Lounge itself is so pretty, classy and cosy. The service staff were amazing - so considerate in seating, taking orders, taking photos, helping with food service, very attentive to any requirement at all. Even the passing chefs noticed even the slightest indication of requirement - it was really impressive. The food was so fantastic - a great range without being too much. As with Afternoon Tea expectations, the desserts and sandwiches were wonderful - works of art in themselves, a wide variety, and so nicely displayed. But for the larger eaters, there were roasts and accompaniments and local specialties. At one point, servers came around the tables with an extra treat - fresh hokkien noodles. We had a wonderful experience and will definitely return either by ourselves or with other guests. I'm sure MIL will be eagerly awaiting a return on her next visit! We've done other afternoon teas in Singapore, but this is now a favourite
2
Not a pleasant experience if the food quality is not up to standard!!My first high tea in Singapore was here back to 90's! Scones and cakes were being served instead of come in a cake tray as most of the high tea sets! Food quality was not up to standard on Tuesday! Quite disappointed in fact
5
My daughter, son in law and my husband attended afternoon tea here for Mother's Day. We didn't ring until 12 noon yet they could fit us in, From the environment to the atmosphere, the impeccable customer service and the wonderful wonderful food this by any measure is an outstanding way to enjoy an afternoon.The staff where refreshing, you could tell they enjoyed their role. The food was plentiful, varied and tasty. This is the fourth time I've been to this venue as we always come when we visit Singapore.this time just happened to be Mother's Day, and all mothers received a surprise gift too. If you can book and enjoy, you won't be disappointed.
5
Give a big craps to Chef Chong as he deserve all the compliments for his excellent pass around Hokkien Mee and Deep fried prawn with pineapple purÃ©e. Hokkien Mee which you couldn't found any authentic than this either from any hawker stall from outside or any outlet in hotel in Singapore. King prawn congee is definitely a must try and Singapore Laksa which you could die for as well! One of the best high tea in Singapore and we will definitely be back for! Kudos to service staff, Mark as well for his attentive and excellent services which make my high tea experienced an enjoyable and warm.
5
On 24th April, I celebrated my birthday at this outlet and had a wonderful time. My close friends and I enjoyed the buffet spread very much. We were introduced to 2 beverages, Shanghai Rose and Sunrise Berry. Both were thirst quenching and nicely blended. A commendation goes out to Chef Chong, who found ways to do something special for our party of 3. Kudos also to Salvatore Adaldo, F&B Manager. He made the special occasion so much more memorable with his interaction and hospitality. I would recommend going to this outlet, regardless of the occasion
5
High tea with quality food and good tea. Wish that it stretches to 3 hours. 2.5 hours is too short. If there is more promo, I don't mind. Should have a rotation of menu coz the food is always the same. Been there twice in a Mth
5
Being a repeat customer to the Tea Lounge for the past year, the offerings never fails to please my palate. From the mouthwatering Eastern and Western cooked food selection to the delicious dessert spread, one will surely be spoilt for choice! My partner is a Mocha fiend, and he reckons the Tea Lounge serves the best Mocha beverage in Singapore. I, on the other hand, am always left with a mini conundrum by the list of tea blends that they have concocted. (Shanghai Rose is a marvellous choice, in my humble opinion.) The staff are always friendly and accomodating, the head chef has a tendency to surprise the patrons with his servings of Hokkien noodles or freshly prepared titbits that he personally serves, straight from the kitchen. The buffet is constantly topped up, so do not fret!I suggest making a reservation in advance, but trust me, you will not be disappointed
5
Nice ambiance, great service and hospitality. The staff aware we need a place for our bag even before we ask for it
5
The scones at Regent hotel are soft & nice texture no matter how long we leave them in the open..
& kudos to the waiter & waitress who provided very dedicate services!
3
Good atmosphere and food quality, especially the live stations. However, the spread is not very wide.
5
Good food, nice ambience, superb service and overall very good! To me I would think the best high tea so far I had in Singapore. Keep it up!
4
when for high tea with kid and my husband celebrate my birthday , good place , good food , very enjoy , and thank for the small cake given by tea lounge .
5
Surprisingly the main courses are quite nice (even though it's suppose to be a high tea buffet). The desserts have quite a variety as well..
5
Everyone from Manager to Service Staff to even the Chef at the station were friendly and provide very good service throughout the meal. Thanks.
5
I have returned here for hi tea many times. Love the variety, ambience and especially the tea. Service staff were attentive and with the accompanying pianist, it was simply wonderful experience.
5
This was sooooo good. First they bring you a box with little jars of tea inside for you to open and smell to choose your tea. We went for the Shanghai Rose which is a blend of lychee and rose and was so delicious we scoured the Internet when we got home to the UK to find some to buy. Then they brought us a 3 tiered plate each of delicious sandwiches, pastries, cakes and scones. It was a struggle to eat it all but we managed. Highly recommended
5
Love the varieties of spread. Pleasing display and not so crowded place during first seating, that gave you space and a breeze in picking your favorite items. The selection of hot meals are impeccable. Try their lobster porridge. It was delectable and perfect for rainy afternoon. The tasty porridge was really a favorite, they came in a pot and it was gone very quickly.Don't be fooled with just the chilli crab gravy. This gravy is surprisingly studded with crab meat and slivers of eggs, you will not get enough just by a scoop. Feel pampered with the selection of dessert, from scones, local kuehs, chng tng to crÃ¨me brule and macaroon, they are simply delish. The tea selection was beyond my expectation. Each diner is entitled to two pots of different tea. You are sure to find your favorite pick, from black tea, fruit tea or caffeine-free. It is really a wide array.The service staff were very prompt, professional and friendly making the whole experience wonderful. We also liked that the Manager came to our table and made a small conversation to our group. Seating was arranged in a way that is not to close to each table, giving you a bit of relaxing space. Overall experience is truly worth the afternoon spent.
5
This is the best high tea place in singapore. Quality and service is the best. The only down side is the Increasing price.
4
Quality high tea buffet with wide selection of tea - ideal place to hang out and catch up with family or friends over the weekend!
5
leisurely afternoon tea on vacation was superb, fresh sweets and delicious italian coffee, not burnt and meticulously served, by attentive staff.
5
Very good service and good quality of food. 2nd time here and especially love the pastries. Wish that the hotel would extend their high tea buffet to weekdays though.
5
Good selection of food. Fresh and beautiful display. Friendly staff. Comfortable ambience with live music playing (pianist)
5
Beautifully presented and delicious. Definitely for pastries lover! The only dislike is the sofa sitting. Will go again but will ask for table sitting.
5
Food was as usual good. Not too many choices (good mix of local and western) but more importantly, quality was top notch.
4
Spread was good especially the dessert. Drinks menu can be improved and can have more international items. There are no ice cream
5
V nice ambience setting. Polite staff who is attentive. Excellent spread of top notch quality. Loved the cakes and also warm food. The laksa and hokkien mee were superb and highly recommended. Generous 2 servings of beverage. Tea was heavenly esp shanghai rose and italian panettoni. Iced latte could be better. Otherwise so tempted to come back for more. But bring an super empty tummy alon
4
Friendly service. A good spread available, just a bit disappointed that some items in the menu were not in the actual buffet. Satay, congee and scone were among the more memorable dishes. Would be good if they will not limit it to 2.5 hrs per session, it still felt a bit rushed. 2 choices of drink, free-flow was great, we shared the tea and had a total of 4 choices of drinks for 3 pax.
5
The whole experience was excellent! I highly recommend all who want to eat there for the first time to try this out - you will not regret it!
3
Fabulous ambience, the extensive selection of food and beverages simply leaves you spoilt for choice. The staff are not only attentive, but they actually make the sincere effort to chat and check on your dining experience.

This is my nth time in Tea Lounge and this time around we've tried to use the Chope promotion. Although unfortunately that the promo wasn't honoured. The food and service team is always a top notch.

This place serves nice cakes, tea and sandwiches.
Ambience is ok except I find it a little warm as the air con is not powerful enough.
Recommended.

Great ambience and service but limited selection of food as compared with other hotels' hi-tea. Great dessert options though.
5
Thanks for making my mum's birthday celebration at the Tea Lounge such a pleasant one! We were really impressed with the food variety as well as the quality of the food even though it's only a high tea buffet, it's comparable to a lunch buffet in our opinion!

This is our 5th or 6th time enjoying tea at the Tea Lounge. We enjoy the quiet atmosphere when we go on weekdays for the high tea set. This review is for the weekend high tea buffet.There is soft piano music playing discreetly in the background and the tables are far apart so you can have proper conversations. The place is always fully booked but never frenetic.The service is impeccable. The food is superb and variety and choice huge, there is something for everyone and no way you could taste everything. The local dishes like laksa, hokkien mee and satay are authentic. There are lots of choices for those with a Western palate - cheeses, salads, delicate finger sandwiches, waffles, churros, scones, macarons, lots of cakes and pastries. Quality ingredients like smoked salmon and 4 kinds of caviar are offered. There was even roast beef and yorkshire pudding. The waiters also come out periodically from the kitchen with trays offering extra items around. Every item was beautifully made and presented and full of flavour.You get to choose 2 drinks - different types of espresso drinks or chocolate as well as a mind -boggling variety of teas.The Chope deal of $50++ was a welcome bonus making this a value for money deal as well.I hate to write such a good review because its going to be even harder getting a table, but they deserve it

I visited the Tea Lounge on Feb 11, 2017 with a friend. We had a grand time chatting and trying all sorts of variety of food. It is a international tea spread with hot Asian dishes to all types of cakes, scones and desserts. The service staff are professional and friendly. The ambience is nice enough to spend a few hours to chat and relax.
5
I had the most memorable experience at Tea Lounge. The service was impeccable! When I was there on 5 Feb at 12pm for the weekend hi-tea, all the staff present were attentive and pleasant. The variety of food was just right and I will definitely come back again
5
Using Chope was easy and enjoyed the experience at Regent once again. Live piano music.The food selection is not extremely wide but each type was exceptional.The pastry and food chefs were careful to engage guests and make sure everything was in order.Staff were very attentive.Taste of their famous laksa was top and I enjoyed the smoked marlin & salmon.Thoroughly good experience, just book ahead to avoid disappointment
5
Excellent food with lovely wait staff. Had a wonderful time there with my partner whilst we picked from a nice selection of teas/beverages and enjoyed ourselves to high tea/cakes!
Although it is quite pricey but well worth the experience and memories.
5
It was my birthday and the whole dining experience at The Tea Lounge was just fantastic. Service staff are professional & helpful!
4
The food was good for a buffet tea and the staff was ever helpful and friendly. We had a good time with 3 young kids enjoying the various types of food. The selection was respectable for a tea buffet and with good quality of food.
5
Wide range of international food combined with a very warm service.
Special mention to Salvatore that has been really friendly and professional at the same time.
5
Very good variety of food. Both western and Asian. Excellent Flavours of tea. Very good service. Will surely go back again
5
Had tea here because of a screw-up in reservation by another place. The afternoon tea here was brilliant. The service was impeccable and the food superb.
5
Great place to go for! Price is on the high side but it is totally worth it! Been to other hi tea but no place is as good.
5
I had visited Tea Lounge multiple times since a couple of years ago and I was thinking why not having Christmas Eve Buffet lunch there.Turns out to be a great choice as the restaurant is still the same as the last time I visited. The food variety is great, the ambience is nice, the staff even still recognized my family
2
Paid $65++ per pax for the festive weekend high tea. Totally not worth it. Service is slow and they take a while to clear our plates. Food is nothing to shout about. Some of the items that are supposed to be eaten hot is cold eg satay and taste terrible as a result. There is absolutely nothing festive about the menu - in fact, the offerings is the same or possibly less than their regular weekend high tea. No festive items at all. For that price, you're better off going elsewhere
4
Came here for afternoon tea with some girls and had a really nice time. Ambiance was good, but a bit outdated in terms of design. The lounge was about half full on a weekday so it felt like we had the place to ourselves. Service was excellent and the festive afternoon tea menu was delicious. We were actually quite hungry but 2 tea sets were enough for 4 ladies to share. Will definitely be back! Forgot to use the chope 10% discount though. Next time :
5
I have visited tea lounge many times and it never failed me a single time. The service is TOP notched, the food is great (ESP the prawn congee), and we have a great time there. Thank you
5
Good service and ambience with high quality and wide variety of food. (: However the desserts are appealing but not exactly tasty. Overall still worth to go!
4
Celebrated our birthdays over high tea, love the prawn porridge and grilled salmon especially. Definitely going back again!
5
The service staff are very attentive and the ambience is awesome. Quality of food is excellent. Highly recommended place to dine in.
5
We went there for afternoon tea with family.There were wide selections of food and all were so delicious!The staff were very friendly especially Sous Chef Chong who will walked around offering and serving his specialities, local delights! Not only his food was delicious, he was very friendly, approachable and attentive too! Chef Chong also will constantly checked on the food to ensure its freshness. He even noticed that we were trying to get the attention of a staff and he asked the staff to attend to us! We will definitely dine there again in the future because we had such a wonderful dining experience with our family there! Dining all the yummy food and spoilt with their excellent service! Thank you Sous Chef Chong and the rest of the staff at Tea Lounge! Keep up the good work!!

Mouth watering Wide selection of local faves like laksa,satay, chicken wing & rojak. Sushi. and sashimi counter , baked salmon, beef , delicious caviars, a variety of interesting cold appetisers such as scallop with soba, pomelo prawn salad and several sandwiches , cakes, kuehs...Many types of tea selection or if you prefer coffee,cappuccino, latte...Pricey at $61++ but value for money!! They offer 2 sittings so place your reservations.Great service

High tea is one of my favourite things to do, so for my birthday i really wanted a high tea to be part of my day. At first i was looking for a venue that wasn't in a hotel lobby but the high tea area at the Regent was stunning and because of this experience i don't think this way anymore.Not only was the High tea one of the best i had ever had but my friend was on a special diet and Chef Chong created an entire High tea especially for her that looked like mine but was all the foods she could eat. Chef Chong also came out to see us personally and also to see if everything was ok for my friend. Sheila (Tea Lounge staff) texted me twice and spoke to me on the phone to clarify my friends dietary needs. Upon arrival her service and attention was exceptional. We were given the most amazing choices of tea and the piano music filled the air, he even sung and played happy birthday which was beautiful. The whole experience was fantastic. Although i planned it as a part of my birthday celebration, it became the highlight of my day. I still talk about it now. A big thank you to all the staff at the Tea Lounge especially Sheila and Chef Chong, Belynda Seal

Small, focused array of hot food, with plenty of desserts to go along with 2 choices of drinks per pax, makes this place a good choice to while away a couple of hours on a weekend.Highlights include the char siew pastry, roast wagyu beef(done well but little marbling), baked salmon and of course the various baked items like scones and bread butter pudding. Salads were a letdown though.Staff are friendly and helpful, attentive and never snobbish, unlike some hotels. The Four Seasons training evidently helped

When I learned that Michelin Two-star Caprice Pastry Chef Nicolas Lambert will be the guest chef at the Tea Lounge from 14 to 16 October 2016, I quickly made a reservation for myself and a friend for that weekend's high tea buffet. It was very convenient making a reservation via Chope and the restaurant was also quick in confirming the booking. We arrived 20 minutes early for the 12pm seating. Maybe because it was a deviation from the usual high tea service, the restaurant was still rushing the setup minutes before the opening. Nonetheless, we got to our seats on time after being ushered by their friendly staff. They had an excellent selection of teas to choose from. I both liked the Italian Panettone and Mango Lemon Tango teas I ordered. Knowing that the desserts were by Chef Nicolas, we limited our intake of the equally excellent savouries. My friend liked the satay and the fried chicken wing while I had two servings of the pomelo and prawn salad along with a few bites of the other offerings. We quickly moved into the dessert tower and tried our best to taste the dozen or so sweets. My favorites would be the one with hazelnuts (double finger, paris brest, chocolate mousse), the very nice looking macarons, the chocolate coconut pie and, of course, the item from the Chef's live station - the chocolate profiterole. But honestly, all of them taste good and suited my personal preference of creamy, very sweet and softly textured pastries. I really had a wonderful time enjoying the high tea and was even more impressed by the service of the very attentive staff, Mel, Melody, Jennifer and to the rest of the team. I'm glad I came to this special occasion. Amazing job chef!Tip: I purchased chope vouchers as a DBS cc holder for the first time and got an additional 10% off bringing my total savings to SGD 30.00
5
Warm welcome and very friendly staffs with their greetings and beautiful smile. My friend and I were amazed by the quality of the 3 tier afternoon tea spread at the Tea Lounge. With nice ambience and the pianist playing smoother music it really make us enjoy the foods and relaxing. Great foods and today they have special dishes prepare by the chef. Highly recommended for an afternoon tea at Tea Lounge. Keep it up!
5
The Regent Hotel maintains it's popular classic hi tea with refreshing offerings, unbeatable ambience and great service.
5
The attention to detail, warm service and pleasant smiles of the folk at Tea Lounge keep bringing me back to this wonderful place! And the food is delectable too!
4
We particularly enjoyed the king prawn congee, the panetone tea, the tiny sandwiches, and the various pastries. The service was excellent, teapots were topped up consistently, empty plates were cleared immediately, The pianist even played Let It Go for my daughter
5
Me and my Fiance are frequent visitors to Singapore and every time we go we make sure to squeeze in a high-tea at the regent tea lounge. We are self proclaimed high-tea connoisseurs, partaking in such experiences all over the world and this is our favorite hands down, and at such a reasonable price. Oh and best coffee i've had so far in Singapore
3
Limited variety of items but quality not bad. Very disappointed with the soggy scones and roast beef. Good laksa and prawn porridge though. Service needs to be a bit more attentive in clearing plates. Overall still an option if I need a afternoon tea buffet fix on a weekend. Love the complimentary parking
5
We were amazed by the quality of the high-tea spread at Tea Lounge, as well as the wide array of offerings including local delights such as Chicken Rice alongside the typical English high-tea items. The ambience at the lobby was lovely, with nice natural light in the late afternoon. I will highly recommend Tea Lounge for a good high-tea experience
5
Staff are attentive and polite at all times. Good variety of food but it's so much that we cannot taste all due to limited stomach space. But we have tried our best Recommend to go during weekends and have a go at the congee. It's very flavourful
5
It was my best friend's birthday yesterday and I traveled from Perth to see her. We had high tea at the Regent as part of the day's celebrations. I have a VERY restrictive diet and the chef Alex made a whole menu just for me. ABOVE AND BEYOND the call of duty. Sheila (maitre d') contacted my friends before to clarify my needs. My fiend had the Singapore Celebration high tea, which looked amazing and apparently tasted even better! Sammin played 'Happy Birthday' on the grand piano as well as many other lovely tunes. We were in AWE of the service, tastes and attention to detail. Thank you to all concerned!
5
We go there once every 4-6 weeks and we have never been disappointed. The offerings rotate and the display is always attractive. With piano and classic furniture, it's a great way to indulge oneself in otherwise and forget that one is in a tropical sweaty country
5
This is our 4th time having the weekend high tea buffet, the last time was Dec 2014. The prices have gone up slightly and they have added more hot dishes. It is a very good spread, good value for money and the service was EXCELLENT as usual ! The sous chef ran around supervising the cutting of wagyu beef and serving prawn congee to the customers. The King Prawns congee was exceptionally good ! The vinaigrettee sesame dip for the chicken rice elevates the taste of the dish to another level.Our top favourites include : Cold prawn salad, Wagyu beef, Scones + clotted creamWe will definitely be back 
5
I will visit again. Love the environment there. service also good. food is nice. This is the 3rd time i go.
4
A wonderful Monday afternoon I had. Friendly staffs, service was good and I like the scones! Will come back for the scones!
5
Lovely setting for High Tea, was a pleasure to be sitting in such lovely décor and served High Tea. Food was well presented and tasty. Staff were most accommodating with our dietary requirements and changed serving to our wishes.Loved the décor in the hotel, a feast for the eyes. A simply delightful afternoon, thank you to staff at the Regent
5
It was an ladies outing to celebrate a pal's birthday. We were all impressed with the food availabilities, quality and presentation. We have been to several other top hotels' high tea this year but all of us agree that Regent's is our favourite! Food items were replenished frequently and both the cooking and service staff were friendly, attentive and helpful. We will be back very soon
5
Our family loves to go to high tea at the Regent, so now we have to think up excuses to go! Today we went for a late Father's Day, birthday, 3rd anniversary of living in Singapore, and a lot of other things which really weren't actual reasons.High tea is wonderful. Not only is the food amazing, but the staff and the location are also excellent. Recently they put in place a new menu which is larger, and, in many ways, better. Everything is in small portions so that you can eat a wide variety of foods. The desert table is absolutely wonderful. I would make sure that you eat an equal amount of savoury and sweet!The staff is really wonderful as well. One of them has started recognising us and will make a point of greeting us. They are really polite and helpful.The Regent itself is a fantastic hotel, and it has a wonderful atmosphere. The atmosphere gets better at 1:00 when a pianist begins playing. I would recommend going at the 12:00 session if you want it to act as your lunch, but then planning a good 1 to 2 hour space of time to eat. This is definitely a good idea for a delicious and filling meal
4
If they stuck to "high tea" and just had teas and little sandwiches and cakes and such, it would probably be better. It is practically a buffet at this point which is not exactly "high tea".That being said... The dessert assortment is lovely and some of the chocolate offerings are amazing. The tea selection is good and well served. Overall the service is quite good.If you want good tea and biscuits and cakes and scones (with real clotted cream), they have it. They have just about everything else too...The setting in the soaring atrium lobby is stunning
4
Last visit in May 2015 was a memorable experience thus a revisit. However the signature Wagyu roast beef and lobster congee was missing - replaced with a normal roast beef and king prawn congee which still taste yummy. Lovely spread of sweet n savoury treats. Service was excellent, especially Sn Captain Alice who assisted with reservations. Using The Chope app to make reservation is such a breeze.
4
Went to Tea Lounge, for high tea.Nice and pleasant. Staffs are efficient.I had reserved a table few days ago.Today morning, I received notification via SMS to remind me of the reservation.I went there at 3.20 pm and staff at the counter led me to table, and I browse thru the menu (for choosing tea.)I decided to go for mango tea and white wine.There are wide variety of food to choose. Got scone, waffles, Japanese sushi, salad, soups, roast beef with yorkshire pudding, steam chicken rice, satay , wide variety of desserts..Benefit is that you can choose what you want to eat, Spend $84 for this high tea buffet
5
I love going to the tea lounge for high tea. It's just as a high tea lounge should be - dark wooden furniture, large windows, comfortable chairs and sofas, and book-lined walls to complete the picture.There's a lovely variety of teas - I like a blend of Darjeeling and Assam. Weekday teas are on tiered platters - too many sweets for my liking but delightful nonetheless. I prefer the more lavish weekend tea that is a buffet and offers many more non-bread, non-sweet options. Weekends and weekdays offer good scones—elemental in a high tea—though I'm not a fan of the uber-sour lemon curd that comes with (they also have regular strawberry jam). The Tea Lounge is one of my two top choices for high tea in Singapore (and I'm a connoisseur of high teas)
5
This was my third visit to the Regent Singapore and it won't be the last. They frequently change the menu but there are always the staples of gorgeous scones and scrumptious chicken and mushroom puffs. I had the lovely Regent blend tea. It was so filling that I could not finish it. Sheila, who has been working at the Tea Lounge is still delightful and helpful as ever. At S$45 plus taxes and service it is still excellent value. Will definitely be going back
5
Good place and quite private. The service is good and the food and tea is nice too, though the price is a little bit steep for Hi-Tea.
5
Having visit my fourth visit, it is an absolute delight with friendly hosts and smiles, aside then the variety of food and great selection of teas, desserts and savory items!
Rated as one of the best high tea venue choice in my opinion!
5
Excellent courteous customer service. Super sweet people. Very polite. The food is always great. Coffee Pau!!!! Get it, IT CHANGED MY LIFE!!! It always a pleasant meal and service here.
4
V nice setting to Chill & Chat over Hi-Tea with frens & family. Love the Quality Sweets but the Savoury us not to my liking.
4
Been to the tea lounge a few times with guests as the ambience is pretty good. Good selection of food.
On this visit, however, we noticed that the food was pretty salty which was a real pity.
5
Great variety of good quality food and fabulous service where the team really welcomed my husband and I and our two young boys and made us feel very comfortable.
4
Cakes and coffee are really nice but the hot savoury food is not so good. Nice place to have afternoon tea with friends, as the hotel lounge area is really relaxing and the staff are great.
4
Decent place for high tea. STandards have dropped a little but it's still decent. PRice is a little on the high side.

My husband and I enjoy going for afternoon tea when we travel, so based on past reviews we decided to try the Tea Lounge. All the usual traditional English and French afternoon tea fare, all very tasty and beautifully presented. What really makes the Asian afternoon tea experience so good, is the addition of a broad range of savoury and sweet local dishes. Allowing foreign visitors to sample a number of Malaysian, Chinese and Indian style treats as well. The staff were friendly, courteous and efficiently attentive clearing our plates and cutlery quickly and unobtrusively, and replacing them. Customers can select two types of tea and coffee or both throughout from the extensive choice list. Excellent if one likes a robust tea with savouries and a more delicate tea blend or a coffee with sweets. Again everything was beautifully presented in delicate tea cups with small silver plate tea services for each individual. Teapots, spare hot water jugs and milk were continuously replenished by serving staff at your table. Be sure to bring a healthy appetite because it really is a full meal even if you take tiny samples of everything and we left very replete even though we tried to pace ourselves. We fasted the following 24 hours to un do all the calorie overload. The whole experience compared favourably with other teas we have had in parts of Asia and even better than the somewhat overpriced and overrated experiences we have had in London, Paris etc
5
The place to go for good afternoon tea buffet. Expect traditional tea offerings like scones (which is among the best one can get in Singapore) and a good selection of local savoury dishes. I especially like the Thai style chicken wings, prawn congee and chicken satay.
5
I went on sunday 12.00 with my friend. The service, food taste and atmosphere are very good but a bit pricy
4
wonderful ambiance, good selection of food items. lovely place to catch with friends and family. recommended
5
Food is good services is good too lots of variety of food to choose from and dessert is fantastic!!!
4
I always go to The Regent on weekends for high tea. Love the cozy ambience and friendly staff. Food varieties have increase and they all taste so good.
5
The food was average but the service is the best i had came across for a long time. The staff goes the extra length to make the day pleasant. Highly recommended for its service excellent.
4
Waitresses and chefs were attentive, professional and polite. One of the waitresses recognised us as we are returning customers. Food is of good quality though a little on the pricey side. Will be even more attractive if Tea Lounge offers 1-for-1 promotion occasionally.
5
We went for Afternoon Tea on a weekday afternoon. Reservation was easy (on line). Setting was lovely and relaxing with live piano music (though the recorded music during piano breaks was unfortunately rather unpleasant - my only complaint). Service was impeccable - very professional yet warm and friendly. Food and tea were also excellent, with a good tea selection including some interesting and uncommon options. Would definitely go there again
5
I was taken here for Sunday High Tea as a Mothers Day treat. I was expecting a few sandwiches and cakes as we would have at home, was I in for a surprise!The surroundings are wonderful, very elegant and Colonial style. The staff were wonderful (not once did I get the impression that they were thinking "greedy pig"!).I was bowled over by the amount and quality of food available. There was so much that I literally didn't know where to start! There was everything from sushi to roast beef and Yorkshire pudding. The tea selection was extensive and served in white china cups. I cannot even mention the selection of deserts without literally drooling. Sadly i was too full up to try many! I was very, very impressed and hope to return one day. If you get chance then go, you won't be dissappointed
5
Let's start with the cost and get it over- $162 including tip and taxes for two.We came on Valentine's Day, last minute and were told we would have a table by the piano ( which is out of main area) but ended inside- both places would have been fine.The choice of food is amazing- meat, lamb, chicken, fish... Seafood, sushi, different types of pickled fish, salads, spreads ( hummus, olive paste....), caviar, cheeses and moreAnd for the "tea sandwiches" - tiny exquisite pastries- truffles on spinach bread, smoked foie gras in little pastries with strawberry........ A mustThe scones were perfect- if you like scones... Light and tasty with all the condiments +++Deserts --- if you still have room, the macaroons were the best I've had ( and I like to consider myself a specialist )My favorite - the "high tea" classics- scones, macaroons and the little pastries ( everything else is excellent- just don't miss out on those )Bottom line- the official time was over 15 min ago and everyone has paid, BUT- the full buffet is still open for another 30 min!!!! No early close down or feeling of being rushed
4
Went for a high tea buffet on Saturday. Reservation is recommended. Excellent selection of food ranging from an assortment of cheeses, caviar, lobster congee, lamb etc. to sweets such as numerous macaroon flavones, waffles, churros and scones with clotted cream. What is worth mentioning is that everything served was of good quality (a rarity at buffets). Not too crowded as well and service was very attentive despite not being many of them. they also allow 2 different drinks (coffee, wide selection of hot teas and hot/Ice chocolate) although drinks were only slightly above average. What is lacking is ambience (not as nice as some other high tea places such as ritz or scotts lounge at Hyatt) and also they did not manage to replenish the food fast enough although when asked they did so quickly.
5
My first visit after so much good reviews.I must say that it is a very pleasant afternoon with quality food and tea.I really enjoyed my experience.
5
Still the best High Tea for my family. Service is very good as well abd ofcourse the food was amazing!
4
Was there on Christmas Eve 2015 with family. Choice and service were superb. You can see real pride in the presentation of the dishes especially desert. Dining room is an open type lounge with towering headspace. A real treat
5
If anyone wants to enjoy a fabulous buffet high tea with service with a smile, the tea lounge at the regent is the place to go! Simply wonderful!
5
Beautiful setting, attentive staff and mouth watering food. A visual feast. A great way to celebrate with family and friends.
5
Small selection but good quality for most items. Lovely scones with unlimited tea and hot chocolate. Delicious wagyu beef and baked salmon. Seats are not very comfy for dining though.
5
caviar, ikura, salmon confit, pate, seafood salads, roasts and the highlight, pretty to look at desserts
4
We are big Afternoon Tea fans when travelling in Asia so decided to give the regent a try.It was quite expensive at a final cost of over $50 each but delicious with a huge variety of both savoury and sweet bites. Much to our surprise we found we were quite full by the end.there were a selection of around 15 teas with individual pots for each of us. During the meal we each had the pot refilled twic
4
When paying for the bill, the server actually brought the portable hand held point of sale to let me sign. The way it is done seems to prioritize the tips rather than the convenience it brings.One very upsetting part is that I have a group of 10 persons. I actually asked whether there is a complimentary parking coupon. She said yes. I said I need 3. She hesitated and look at the bill about of $593.20 and said that she can only give 2. I was upset by the style in which the whole payment process. In the end I gave $10 tips before proceeding to the next screen page to sign off the bill.When we were leaving, we realized that of the 5 cars my friends and I drove, 3 cars were parked at Regent Hotel, it was quite awkward between us that we only have 2 complimentary parking coupons when we were heading down the staircase to the car park.In the end, I went back to their kitchen door and request to see a cashier. Fortunately another waitress came out and thought that I have a bill dispute but I actually said I need another Peking coupon as we are short of one more. This waitress is much more gracious and went to get one more parking coupon for me. The issue was resolved. On looking back, I think the first waitress should have made our experience more pleasant and give the 3 coupons in the style of Regent Hotel.
5
During the week afternoon tea is offered, on weekends, high tea with some extra options is available. The setting is relaxing and is located within this beautiful hotel. There was a selection of cakes, savouries and their trademark scones served with your choice of their own blended teas (the vanilla blend is fantastic) and coffees. You are able to pay a little more and have champagne if you wish. The service and the food were excellent
5
went on last sat for friend's birthday and hotel has prepared a complimentary birthday cake which is very delicious, food spread was very good and delicious, will visit again
4
Decided to try out the high tea buffet after hearing so many positive reviews, though price was a little steep but we found it value for money. We were wowed and wooed by the beautiful spread offered, our taste buds were treated to a delectable variety prepared with quality and freshest ingredients. The rich taste of the congee still lingers in my memory..it was so good! Service was attentive and the team was on all smiles. Brings back lovely memories I once had at the Basilico outlet in the hotel. We will definitely be back reminiscing such lovely service and food! ;
4
In the middle of the hotel as you enter to the left. Nice friendly staff and good selection of pastries and sandwiches. Not exactly the kind of place for a quiet tête-à-tête but if you wanted to catch a quick bite on the go this is ideal.
5
Had a great time yesterday Mooncake festival Staffs all are so friendly Food are great and love the cold hot chocolate       
3
We can select tea from more then 10 kinds of tea. And,hot water pored the the pot after three cups of tea we enjoyed. Cakes, scorns, sandwiches are good. 
3
Made a reservation for a table for 3 on 11th Aug . Reservation confirm again around 19th Aug. 22nd Aug, we went for the high tea. As we were early, we can see them arranging the tables and chairs. At this time, we saw a floor manager maybe, putting together a table and 3 chairs right beside the piano and it was like a makeshift arrangement for last min walk-in customers. So it's our turn to go in the cafe, who knows that table is meant for us. Quite disgust to say that we booked early yet was given a make shift table arrangement. 1st impression of the service had given us a bad one already, we were intending to leave if no alternative sitting arrangement was given. But, they manage to get a corner seat for us.Food quality were average. Food varieties could consider ok but can be better. Overall services are averge if not considering what we encountered before going in. I realize they tend to concentrate on bigger group more and the smaller group would have to take some time to be attended to. Would I be going back? I guess not. Everything can be considered as over-rated
5
Excellent Afternoon Tea. Perfectly romantic tea with my husband; lovely with the grown-up family; great catch-up with friends. Very high quality ingredients, setting, and service. Cannot fault this place
3
The quality of the spread is quite good. However, I wonder if it is becos of high popularity of the high tea which makes the management/staffs very commercial. We took the 11.30am to 2.30pm slot and were asked to leave right on the dot at 2:30pm. I admit that we seldom take the early slot, hence we didn't know that we have to leave punctually. The staff also didn't come to remind us that we still have our 2nd pot of tea/coffee yet to order. Right after we paid the bill, we were told to leave immediately as they need to turn around the tables. Though they did it in a polite manner, we really appreciate given the heads up or maybe another 5 or 10 min to finish our food on the plate.
4
The high tea session served the perfect setting for our gathering of 10, for a group who hasn't met for about 19 years since our graduation from uni. The good food + nice food variety + beautifully elegant ambience + personable and prompt client service = amazing moments! Thanks Tea Lounge
5
We ended up at the Regent as our initial choices were already fully booked.The food was a gastronomic delight. The taste matched the appearance of the lovely cakes, tartlets, sweets and savories that one would be spoilt for choice. We ate to the brim and wished we could have added a bit more. Unlike my old fav Carousel, they provided tea in silver pots and fine china with beautiful linen to match which I feel defines an Afternoon Tea most.My only gripe is the price of $70 per person I could have a hearty dinner
4
For 60 dollars per person, you are entitled to great savory bites, excellent deserts and live piano performance in one of the most beautiful hotels. Absolutely worth it !
3
Food was pretty mediocre except for their scones which were soft and not too sweet. A little disappointed with the value esp with such a high price tag of $45++. Will not consider to come here again for their hi-tea
5

The buffet menu, the services and the staff were very good. I would like to visit again. We also enjoyed the live piano performance.

Visited the tea lounge with my cousin over the weekend during my travels to SG. Would definitely recommend! Very good smorgasbord of savoury and sweets, with a live piano performance in the background. Price was decent at about 60pp for food, although I found paying an extra 12 bucks for a pot of tea a little excessive. If you are looking for a classy afternoon and enjoy high teas (and eating as much as physically possible) the the tea lounge is a must try! :

My wife and I enjoyed the fantastic afternoon tea at The Tea Lounge. We have tried a number of High Tea locations in SG and whilst we haven't tried them all to be fair this is the best to date by far (and it is going to take something really special to surpass this for me)Everything about the arrangement was 1st class: food selection (hot & cold as well as sweet and savoury), service level just right and a very pleasant ambience makes this one not to miss

We were there for a weekend high tea buffet. Loved the ambience and service level. Impeccable. As there were just 2 of us (plus a toddler), we were given a relatively small table. But we do not have any complains as the plates were cleared almost immediately after it was emptied. Also like the fact that they offer us 2 drinks per pax. So we can have choices! I chose hot tea and iced chocolate. They also have very generous servings of roast beef, caviar and chilli crab meat! Nice

Excellent Service except a little miscommunication during the phone conversation. A good selection of foods for this high tea buffet. They have a wide selection of Teas. Thru chope app, we got a discounted rate! :) Tip: as we went for the 1st seat-in, we got to leave at 2.30pm. Would preferred to seat in for the second seat-in the next time.

Visited with my family this Sunday. Lovely way to spend the afternoon. Food is delicious, particularly the deserts, which are beautifully presented. Roast meats (duck and beef) were well cooked. Scones were delicious also, the best I've had in Singapore. Tea menu has a good range of teas to choose from, and staff were very good at providing refills. They also offer the choice of changing teas part way through the meal which was welcome. Service is very attentive. Lovely relaxed afternoon. Our second visit, and we are looking forward to returning there soon.

We had high tea and were blown away from the exceptional service of the staff. The sous chef was at the buffet line to introduce the dishes to us, and we observed that he went round to each table to engage the diners. Besides asking about our meal, he made effort to explain dishes to us, and if there was a special request for additional servings, he personally looked into it, to serve the diners. The food was also very good. We enjoyed the Prawn Porridge which was very very tasty and sweet. The Baked Salmon was very fresh and seasoned well. The selection of food was fantastic and definitely value for money. My kids enjoyed themselves tremendously as well. It was a wonderful high tea
5
Very impressed with the food selection and quality. The wagu beef was fantastic as was the laksa. The staff were attentive and the piano player added to the nice atmosphere.

Great Experience @ tea lounge in this hotel , Place where you sit peacefully, sip you tea and relax.
4
Pleasant atmosphere so long as you're seated away from the hotel traffic. Decent food, good tea selection, average service.
3
Some food was good, for example the macarons, scones, tea, baked salmon.
Others such as their local Asian dishes were poorly made.
For the price the selection and quality of food is average.
Service was quite good.
5
I went recently with my family. the service is impeccable and the selection from cold to warm, sweet to savory was impressive. the service was warm and friendly, from the front of house who sat us at our table and took our first orders to the sous chef (surname is chong if i did not remember wrongly) who ensured that the food he served was piping hot and even made an effort to recommend the other items available on the spreadI would definitely return again.

I brought my parents and my children and we all had a wonderful time! The ambience was wonderful, although the place was full, it did not feel too crowded. Service was excellent and the buffet spread was quite delightful.The hot station was great - roasted wagyu, baked salmon, chicken wings, satay, chili crab and laksa - the laksa was particularly flavourful! My parents had second helpings of all the food. The smoked salmon, tuna tataki, caviar, finger sandwiches were all very good, and I heard no complaints at all.I particularly enjoyed the scones -- the clotted cream and peach and lavender jam -- mmmmmmm.... just needed cooler weather, gorgeous blue skies, and I could be in an English country side, savouring this wonderful and delightful tea time munch.The selection of teas on offer was quite extensive, and I enjoyed the Vanilla Rooibos most. Each person is allowed a choice of two teas. The baked cakes and sweet munchies were disappointing after the earlier delights. The red velvet cake was so dry it was really quite horrible. The other cakes and tarts were not very interesting or nice either, quite run of the mill. My son enjoyed the panna cotta, he found it creamy, smooth and delicious!The service staff were helpful, polite, unobtrusive and yet, at the same time, they were available to attend to your every need. Really really nice! Overall, as I mentioned at the start, it was a wonderful experience, and my entire family enjoyed the food and the atmosphere. The excellent service just made the entire experience even more enjoyable!Highly recommended for a nice decent family Sunday brunch/tea

Please go here only when you have leisurely time to enjoy the high tea to the fullest....and also please please when your appetite also justifies. It's a good spread of scones, savories and desserts. Choice of teas ....also coffee or hot chocolate. We enjoyed it thoroughly. It's in the lobby of the hotel so does get noisy at times specially on the holidays

We decided to have High Tea (which actually was more like lunch seeing that it was from noon to 2:30 pm) on a whim and were fortunate enough to get a table.Once there, we were quickly seated and could see for ourselves why the Tea Lounge is such a popular place. The service was good and the food even better.You usually expect that buffets churn out nosh that is, at best, good. However, what we got was inspired food. Food that excites and more-ish and comforting and delicious.Yes, it is a little pricey but you get the impression that they are trying very hard here and that makes all the difference.

We came with high expectations given the review and especially when we sat down and saw that Tea was $62pp ($92 with one glass of proseco). Naturally we opted not to pay an additional $30 for proseco and so proceeded to partake of the High Tea.For starters, The Regent is often underrated given that it does not stand in the main Orchard Road Belt. It is however an extremely elegant hotel with a plush and hushed lobby quite unlike some of the 5 star hotels where kids run riot and patrons of all sorts wander round badly dressed and gawking.The offerings here are vast which is a great change over the neighbouring St Regis (see other review) and the items to go for are from the hot grill section which include wonderful Roast Beef with Yorkshire Pudding, Roast Chicken, Baked Salmon and a delightful Crayfish porridge. Over at the pastry section, they was the usual High Tea fare including scones which came with several lovely Jams, Clotted cream and even Lemon curd. I didn't really try the Sushi counter as the Sushis didn't look particularly appetising but enjoyed the huge selection of cheeses and finished with some fruit ice cream and chocolate truffles (5 rounds in total!) Service was excellent throughout with the wait staff topping up our refreshments including ice watter without having to ask. Even our cutlery was changed at regular intervals when they came to clear the crockery and the supervisors came round a couple of times to check that everything was going well.What I also liked about the Regent Tea is that you can have the option of offering Coffee instead of Tea (they charge you extra at St Regis). The major downsides are the slightly steep pricing and the even more horrifying hotel parking charges. Had it not been for the complimentary parking that each table receives (only 1/table), I would have been most upset at having to pay $16.70 for just over 3 hours parking on a Sunday.Overall a 7.5/10 experienc

One afternoon, my parents came with me and my partner for afternoon tea at Regent Hotel. We enjoyed the buffet and good selection of petit sweets. The buffet was varied offering roast beef and chicken, sushi, salad, scones and a variety of cheeses with sauces. We were surprised that a 3 tier was not offered and that there were only cucumber sandwiches. The location is in the middle of a lobby so feels as if a lot of people are walking past, lacking atmosphere. We enjoyed the pianist though which helped to add to the atmosphere. The water wasn't hot enough for the tea so we had to ask for refills several times. However, we were very impressed with the sweets menu - not just the appearance and variety but the mouth watering taste. Overall, a very pleasant afternoon at an elegant hotel
4
High tea weekend buffet exceeded expectations. Staff were efficient, friendly and attentative. To improve I would urge the management to provide an option for bottomless champagne.
5
We so enjoyed high tea with our friends at the most appropriate time. The selections of edibles was fun and delicious and the tea was special. The service was very good and It was really fun to people watch.
4
This place grows on you, spoilt for choices, selction of assortments is wonderful...goes well with the tea that one can sip thro in this modern settings yet so relaxing ambience..
5
The scones were awesome as usual and so was the satay, crepe, finger foods. Enjoyable experience overall. Thoroughly recommended.

I read about the many good online reviews and tempting pictures posted on blogs. However, I was disappointed when I Finally got to try. The caviar were not as fresh as expected. I was expecting the prawn otah and keuh pati but these were not available when I went. The dessert selection was alright but quality wasn't really fantastic. The only dessert that kept me going was the Cheng tng 清汤. Laksa was good as reviewed in many blogs. Regretted not having another bowl before I leave. The prawn porridge was good too. Clotted cream for the scorn was average too. Overall, I have too high expectation of the high tea probably due to the many online reviews. Personally, I prefer the high tea at Goodwood Park although their selection if food may not be as many at the Tea Lounge.

Came here for high tea on a weekend 22 March. The spread was excellent! The food was of high quality, a lot of hits, one or two misses but nothing bad! Loved the service, prompt and warm. The coffee was of exceptional quality! The wagyu rump was delicious! So was all the local food. Decent cheese selection and outstanding dessert section! Price a tad bit high but for the quality, service and environment ..... All worth it. Definitely the best weekend high tea buffet in Singapore
5
I've been there for high tea 5times on weekday and had a fantastic high tea buffet with husband & daughter for my birthday today! Food & service are excellent. Especially, their desert is the best! Thank you for beautiful chocolate birthday cake! I already booked for our anniversary. I can't wait! 
5
This is the best high-tea I have ever been to.The tea lounge is nice and quiet, the staff very professional and they serve: scones (2 kinds with different jams), candy, ice cream, crepe, waffles, lollipops, cakes, cheesecake, pannacotta, creme brule. Crab, quice, cheese, sushi, steak, caviar, smoked salmon, cured fish and much more.They have a wide variety of high quality tea

The Tea Lounge at the Regent hotel offers a sumptuous buffet high tea on weekends. They have an extensive tea menu to choose from - we enjoyed the Shanghai Rose (black tea with roses) and the Darjeeling teas. The tea lounge is located on the far side of the lobby in nice, relaxing surroundings with a piano player on the grand piano at weekends. We enjoyed the friendly, attentive service of the staff in the Tea Lounge. The buffet selection was extensive - with a good range of sandwiches including egg, cucumber and pate fois gras. There was also a good selection of warm savouries and even carvery choices for those with big appetites. However - the sweets selection was fabulous! From mini cakes through to full size slices. The mini toblerone cheesecake was excellent as was the chocolate mousse and red velvet cake. A wonderful, relaxing and delicious afternoon tea experience

Almost everything I had here was very good, which is surprising for a buffet place. There is an excellent selection of sweet and savoury items, and it's well priced for the quality. Do note that if there are more than 4 of you dining, you may get a sofa seat with low tables, not conducive for dining. Service could be better: our plates were not cleared until we asked, water and tea was not refilled unless requested. Otherwise excellent restaurant, we will return.
4
Service is good but need to improve on the storage condition of the ice cream. The ice cream are stored in metal container which are immersed in a basin of ice resulting in the melted ice cream.
5
We always come here whenever we want a relaxing afternoon, the food and tea, service never fails us. the price has gone up a little bit recently however food variety is also increasing.
The best high tea buffet in Singapore.

While enjoying a walk with our grandchildren we were caught in a sudden and long lasting tropical down pour . The manager of the tea lounge invited us in to see the beautiful gingerbread house shaped like a large Christmas tree.When she saw how drenched we were she brought out towels for each of us to dry our hair..This elegant and sophisticated tea lounge was welcoming and friendly towards unlikely customers and we were very thankful 
4
Service staff is personable and a good selection of food. A bit pricey but worth it! The perfect place for cosy get-togethers of 3-5
3
Scones are hard, Jam offering are on plates, Tea no longer piping-hot because hot water refill is from jug - the quality of the traditional aspect of the afternoon tea has somehow declined.
4
The huge Christmas tree cake is really breathtakingly nice. It attracts many people to take photos. The free flow tea served are very nice, I like the shanghai rose, harmony, whatever berry....every one are nice. The food wise. The savoury food are limited. But they serve the best laksa! The cake served are the best looking that I ever see. This is a great place for those with sweet tooth. Customer service is fantastic. I appreciate that. 
4
Service was prompt most of the time. Waitresses were professional and polite. Arrangements were made to accommodate our request for a proper dinning table for 6
4
Went with a friend for high tea here and we both enjoyed ourselves. Staff are all very friendly and polite, including the chefs at the food station. Tea Lounge offers a good variety of food, albeit some were mediocre. The tea menu isn't one of the best too. But I will still return again

My husband and I came for afternoon tea on one of the weekdays. We arrived at 12pm and had to wait for a while before we were served since no one was in sight. Good selection of tea and clear instructions from the staff on the serving sequence. I am particular about scones and these were one of the better ones i have tasted. Warm and not too flaky or oily. Tasted really great with the clotted cream, jam and lemon curd. The chocolates scones were abit inconsistent though as i noticed the one my husband was given had much more chocolate chips! The other pies, tarts and pastries were good and i liked the beef sandwiches. The amedei chocoate cake was abit too rich and the lemon taste didnt work with it. This was a pity because i really like amedei chocolates. We enjoyed the live piano performance while we had our tea and this was probably the best part of the afternoon.We couldnt finished all the food and asked to takeaway the leftovers. We were told that they dont do takeway which was strange since it wasnt a buffet and we had paid for the food. We had to sit for another hour in order to finish up since we didnt want the food to go to waste.Overall, it was intimate atmosphere and good food with nice live music. Perhaps next time i will come back for the buffet.

I used to rate regent as my favorite hightea. Revisit after a long time but much to my disappointment . Service is still good but food was not that nice. The signature scone was not even warm when serve
5
Wonderful service. Prompt yet not intrusive. Selection of food especially desserts very different and value for money. Includes wagyu beef, caviar, macaroons.
4
It was a great experience with nice ambiance and delectable food. Each and every of the item served was exquisite and delicious
4
Sunday high tea to celebrate his birthday. Both of us take special fancy for their tea and their daily ice tea brew. The food was wide spread for high tea
4
Been able to smell the various tea leaves before choosing our teas for the afternoon tea service was as enjoyable as the food itself. Scones were our favourite but the chocolate n cakes could be better. The waitress was attentive but not intrusive. The place was great to enjoy a relaxing afternoo
5
The hi-tea is very good. Scones are warm, moist and buttery. Sandwiches are nice as well. Good selection of teas.

We had high tea at the Regent recently on a weekday as a treat for our family. The setting is lovely with the live piano and the selection of teas was great. But I thought the food was just OK - and in fact I didn't think the quality of the sweets were great. The scones were hot and fresh and we enjoyed those. I'd say it's nice but if someone asked me which high tea to try in Singapore I do think I would suggested another one.
4
We had the weekend buffet, and enjoyed it very much. The food is fresh and tasty, and there is plenty of it. We had a nice time relaxing, drinking tea, enjoying the live music. Would recommend booking in advance as it was full
4
Went there for their high tea on 16 June. It was Father's Day. I must agree with many reviewers that the selection and quality are up to standard. There are a wide selection of tea to choose from too. Coffee and tea are included in the high tea price. The service was good too. Can easily spend a whole afternoon enjoying tea and food and idling there. Time passed so quickly. Will definitely go back again for such enjoyment.

I brought my mom and my husband here on this Tuesday public holiday, after having a good experience here with one of my friends about 1 week ago. Immediately after we were seated, we were brought a box of tea aromas with different flavours to smell. We were allowed to choose two types of tea. They then brought us finger sandwiches.  Also a big serving of afternoon tea, which included curry puff, lots of desserts, scones, and home made jam and cream etc. This is probably one of the best English afternoon teas that I had, as I used to live in London, and used to have them when my parents visited me yearly. The only words of caution is that if you are not a big dessert and scones eater, then probably you have to order 1 serving less of afternoon tea set, as currently in this hotel, 1 person is given 1 serving of afternoon tea. And it would be such a huge waste if you cannot finish all of them. The tea set is also not too pricey. My mom commented that she liked the decoration of the tea lounge. :) Will be back again soon

Elegant is the word for the setting and the presentation of High Tea at the Regent in Singapore. A choice of two types of tea each from the offered range, were then free flow for the afternoon. A plate of 5 beautiful sandwiches was served first, followed by the 3 tiered set of savoury pastries, sweet cakes and scones all to die for. The cakes were fresh and light, the pastries buttery and crisp and the scones were excellent. Topped off by a pianist on the baby grand providing live background music. A delightful way to spend an afternoon
