This is a cute cafe is a rather dry part of town... the coffee is nice, the service is friendly and the deserts: oh yes! Give yourself a little treat and indulge between conference sessions!!!

Flatbread burgers aren't your average burger. These have been prepared with super, super crisp flatbread buns and packed with the fillings of your choice. Having just one would be able to stuff the average person. Just be ready for a long preparation time.

The food itself was delicious, and my son enjoyed the tarts. But the portion is a little small in comparison to the price paid. Not that I'm a big eater, just a comparison to other diners.

Came here for a coffee today after lunch nearby. My cappuccino was actually pretty good: the right strength and served at the right temperature (not luke warm). Service was friendly and efficient. Only minor point was that I didn't get any pretty coffee art in my coffee (my friend did for his latte though). Better than most of the coffee options in the area

Honestly, I don't know when fArt tArtz opened. But the food and drinks here are sooooo good! Whether it's the food or the presentation, both are 5 stars to me. I'm not a coffee person, but my friends who loves coffee fall in love with their coffee as well. It's a good place to have a meal and just chill around alone or a group of friends. Highly recommended!

This is a great place to work and dine at the same time. Btw take note that they don't provide power plug. So make sure you have your laptop fully charged if you plan to spent hours working there. They serve great food, good coffee and cozy ambience. Try their kabayaki fish and fusion greens salad add on salmon. I love their wasabi Yuzu dressing. It's refreshing and I don't feel burden to have a jar of vegetables. You will never go wrong with kabayaki fish fillet. The fresh fish fillet with skin attached is being fried before shower with secret Japanese sauce. We also ordered mushy mushrooms. Mushrooms lover like me would love this!

This is my 2nd visit at the Chinatown branch. The themed cafe deco is very Korean-like. Very good for wedding photoshoot.I feel that the food are very special in terms of taste and presentation. 1. Bird Nest Brushetta - looks like bird nest; the outer crust is made of yam, topped with sliced veg and prawn. Slightly souring - very appetising.2. Sambal Seafood Pasta - not so spicy; more on the sweet side. Strong taste.3. Salted Egg Yolk Pasta - this is very fusion. A combination of Italian and Chinese cuisine, topped with sliced fish.4. Red Caviar Mentai - this is their new dish. Super great taste. You should try it out.5. Tiramisu and Oreo Mango desserts - looks so nice; like you are eating some plant with soil. Very interesting presentation. Price wise is at the high side.They have locality card where every $20 spent, you get a stamp. As you collect the stamps, you receive free food at the next visit
