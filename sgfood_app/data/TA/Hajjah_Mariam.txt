This is by far the best Nasi Ambeng weâ€™ve had. Reasonable price and good portion for 2pax!
The mee rebus is good too.
All the free flow sambals are good.
Service wise...still have room for improvement.
Will be back!

We thought of having a quick lunch by having nasi ambeng meant for 2 people, however it's too much for both of us who aren't a big eater. Food was great and price is seriously reasonable. However, make sure you ask to see how the tray looks like to ensure you can finish your meal.

Chanced across this busy cafe serving an exciting local dish called Nasi Ambeng, in addition to Nasi Lemak, Mee Rebus and Sayur Lodeh, amongst others. I had been most impressed by this Nasi Ambeng dish a few years ago, served in a palace restaurant in Kampong Glam. So I was delighted to try another version to see if it was just as good. I ordered a dish for myself, and it was served with coconut seronding, achar, and temper tofu. The beef was sold out so I had the chilli padi chicken lemak. It was super spicy hot but tasty!! If you wish to have the full range of dishes, I assume you will need to order a larger platter for 4 persons or so. The restaurant occupied 2 shop spaces, and it was crowded and full of patrons enjoying their food. A nice community way of sharing food. Order the beef rendang early if you wish to avoid it being sold out.

We were not expecting to find good Malay food at any ordinary shopping malls. It was unusual when we came across the store at the Westgate, it was a good feeling at the first sight.We decided to try and we were surprised with what we got. The fried fish was good and also the vegetable curry. As the rice was in quite a big portion, my wife decided to join me with additional two side dishes without rice.We really enjoyed our lunch and will come back soon for other dishes...

If you want to have the opportunity to recall what it means to share a communal home cooked meal with dishes or "lauk" that you only get during special events, then go here to enjoy the tastiness of their ayam masak lemak juxtaposed next to sufficiently sweet-spicy-savouru cononut serunding that sit right by the sambal goreng of tempe, tofu, green beans that will not be as spicy as the sambal sotong (squid).and the rendang beef that just melts in your mouth...just go and try

What is "Ambeng"? Rice platter with other traditional malay authentic dishes served in a rounded tray over a banana leaf. Good for sharing, better when really hungry and best eaten with hands. No one will judge, there is even little teapot set to wash your hands with, it has a little container to collect the water from your wash.This is one of the best "Ambengs" in town. Fairly priced and conveniently located on the third basement of Westgate. Most "Ambeng" finds are normally located around the east of Singapore. A part from the crowd with squeeze seating area you find yourself forgetting all of that the moment you dig into their awesome food. Heavenly beef rending and their chicken lemak is great too. Get both on your platter if you can.Serving very Authentic malay food, great staff, very quick and responsive. Very professional and patience (hungry people can get very scary sometimes) personally witness their staff and cashier was able to managed pretty good. Very impressed.If you cannot finish, just hand them over to one of their staff and ask to pack it for you

The "Ambeng" set meals are the best. So much flavour and skill in the making. Just a joy to look at and to taste. Always eat this on a trip to Singapore. The staff are so friendly and kind. But get there early as there is always a line at lunch time and dinner time

Always walked past this shop at Westgate. It is crowded n packed most of the time. Today, we finally got a chance. Even though we did a take away, the Nasi Padang n Bee Hoon Soto was still so Shiok! Poured the chilli into the Bee Hoon Soto. The broth is rich, thick n spicy. Loved it!!!!!! Chicken for the Nasi Padang is tender n moist yet flavorful. The rice is nicely cooked. Not dry at all. Hubby n I finished up every single bit! *BIG BURP

When i was over at west side on a daytime, boyfriend decided to introduced me to this cafe that sell nasi ambeng of good authentic taste.. The cafe is abit small, perhaps can fill up about 5-6 families of 5.. But dont worry! Services is fast.. You can only wait about 5mins or lesser if you wan to do takeaway if there is no eats available. The serving dine in or takeaway is just as same. You can opt for how many person serving or for you alone. Even if is you alone, the portion can make your lunch full til supper. With good malay aunties as chefs cooking what they do best, you get to taste the authentic taste of malay dishes. There are utensils available if you not comfortable eating with hand, but you should try eating with hand.. With the sauces and gravy on your fingers, when you get to lick it and chew, the taste is beyond great than eating with fork and spoons. The dishes for about 2 personal meal is about 6-8 dishes. Just comeby and have your first try. Like i did, and i will again when im over at the west side. :

The Nasi ambeng is nice but the food is really selling fast and i believe that shows how good their food is . They Have Nasi Ambeng Solo(1pax),Nasi Ambeng Duet(2pax) and Nasi Ambeng Jumbo(3-4pax). Eating there is good for any age and is good for everyone . Price is reasonable. I remember when i went there the first time and it was almost sold out but thes staff impressed us and appreciate our visit that they make Ala Ala nasi ambeng with some of the leftover dishes and make it into a nasi ambeng . Totally touched our heart and that make us keep coming back. I am not sure the crowd lunch but dinner is sometimes packed so do reach there early before 8pm to avoid disaapointment. Very convenient. Nearby to toilet but don't worry about washing your hands as they will provide a pot to wash your hands if you need to . Price is reasonable and food is AWESOME.!
